1m8bzch,https://www.reddit.com/r/nycgaybros/comments/1m8bzch/people_claim_they_want_to_connect_but_they_dont/,People claim they want to connect but they don't?,"So many guys in NY, on apps, out and about, and otherwise are complaining about loneliness or the dating scene or the men here in general. Yet, when I've reached out (through various avenues), a coffee has taken up to 2 years to organize (I'm not joking), barely any follow up effort, ghosting, flaking, and so on still persist. Or a 'check in' after 6 months, only to vanish again.

Then we are told to get off apps and meet people in person and find things in common. I've done this, and its the same thing, you are just ghosted more nicely if anything haha. This includes hookups, I've found it extremely transactional here, even with so-called 'coupled up' dudes, much worse than any other country I've been laid in, and yet this is supposed to be the 'mecca' of the gay world. I've literally met dudes from the same country as me, similar experiences as me, sharing of woes, everything, and still, 99% of things fizzle out. 

I just don't get it. I am literally scratching my head wondering if I am living in some metaverse of NY, as 3 years in, this has not been a great experience in terms of gay life (but otherwise its been great).

I totally get people have busy lives, economy, all of it, but really if you want to make time to connect with someone, I just don't get why this is so hard. How do you build connection in a city which, quite frankly, just doesn't care?",2,1753381073.0,nycgaybros,0,1.0,False
1m8bypx,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertykitchen/comments/1m8bypx/potential_coffee_beverage_hack_using_shelfstable/,Potential Coffee Beverage Hack Using Shelf-Stable Staples,"I keep small amounts of unflavoured whey protein and skim milk powder on hand as part of my pantry staples. The whey powder can slide into a few types of baked goods I make, and the skim milk powder is for when I make yogurt.

That said, I've recently been experimenting with whey powder and coffee. I often don't get enough protein, so my thought was if I could slide a quick 7g into a cup of coffee by adding 1 Tbsp of whey powder to it, I should do that. 

It's a bit tricky, because if you're not careful, the coffee can and will cook the protein and the result will be ick. So it's essential to mix the powder with a bit of water, then add the coffee. When done correctly, the result looks like a coffee with foam on top.

An alternative I tried today was to do 1 Tbsp protein, plus 1 Tbsp milk powder, plus 1-2 Tbsp water. Mixy-mixy, add coffee, and you get something that's more like a latte with foam on top.

I generally take my coffee black, so I don't add any syrups or sweeteners, but these experiments seem like a good springboard for folks who do like those things to add them in.

1m8bwt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1m8bwt8/explore_whether_briggs_riley_essential_carryon/,Explore whether Briggs & Riley Essential Carry-On Luggage lives up to the hype review,"Briggs & Riley BLU122CX-4 Essential Carry-On—Testing Its Limits

Traveling frequently means my luggage needs to handle everything from crowded overhead bins to unforgiving airport floors. The Briggs & Riley BLU122CX-4 Essential Carry-On seemed like an ideal companion, combining durability with thoughtful features. I had the opportunity to test it on multiple trips, and here’s a breakdown based on my firsthand experience.

**Design and Build Quality**

One thing I immediately appreciated was its sturdy build. The black finish with sleek lines looks as premium as it feels. At 22 inches by 14 inches by 9 inches, it fits most domestic airline carry-on standards—even when fully packed. Its ballistic nylon exterior resists wear and stains, a huge plus after accidentally spilling coffee on it (and yes, it wiped off easily without leaving a mark). 

The integrated bottom fabric handle is an underappreciated feature—it made quick grabs from the trunk much easier. Paired with the telescoping Outsider handle, it felt natural to maneuver. It’s clear Briggs & Riley invested in making this luggage stylish and practical.

**Capacity and Packing Efficiency**

Packing this carry-on is almost like playing Tetris. With expandable CX compression technology, it’s deceptively spacious. Expanding the sides using the single-press buttons allowed me to fit a week’s worth of clothes into it. My partner was shocked that I even managed to fit my trusty travel pillow in there. Then, compressing the bag back down into carry-on regulation size was oddly satisfying. 

That little garment folder inside was a gem. Having suits, shirts, and even slacks stay virtually wrinkle-free throughout the flights felt like a victory. However, the ""floating insert"" at the bottom was a bit of an enigma for me. I didn’t find a real use for it since I rely on packing cubes, but others might appreciate it for separating items.  

**Advantages**

- CX compression technology adds space yet complies with cabin restrictions.  
- The Outsider handle design maximizes the internal packing area, minimizing clothing wrinkles.  
- Durable build, including impact-resistant corner guards and high-density wheels.  
- The smart compression straps prevent items from sliding around in transit.  
- Lifetime Guarantee—seriously, Briggs & Riley will repair this thing no matter what happens.  

**[Check Briggs & Riley BLU122CX-4 price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b09y282jqd/)**

**Mobility and Wheels Performance**

Rolling this carry-on through the airport was smoother than I expected, especially since it’s a two-wheeler. I’ve had trouble with four-wheel carry-ons before—the wheels always seemed to snag somehow—but these high-density wheels handle long terminals, sidewalks, and even cobblestones as if they were born for it. Noise levels when rolling were barely noticeable, another little detail that kept the experience seamless.

**Internal and External Pocket Layout**

Having numerous pockets on hand turned out to be a lifesaver. The discrete Powerpocket on the exterior made it easy to charge my phone on-the-go—something I fully appreciated when my battery sank to 5% en route to a gate. Inside, the mesh lid zippered coverings came in handy for toiletries and socks. The simplified SpeedThru pocket lined with orange worked well for travel documents like boarding passes and even spare change I usually forget to store properly.

Sadly though, I wasn’t entirely convinced by the between-the-handle exterior pocket. Its size felt restrictive—trying to store anything larger than glasses or boarding passes there didn’t work. The add-a-bag strap, however, was useful during a recent family trip, as I was able to tether a tote bag securely without juggling multiple straps.

**Areas of Concern**

- At 9.7 pounds on its own, it’s heavier than other carry-ons I’ve used.  
- Not everyone will need or use the floating insert at the bottom.  
- The between-the-handle pocket offers limited utility for larger items.  

**Competing Products**

Having trialed other premium brands like Tumi and Samsonite, I’d say this carry-on sets itself apart with its organizational features and durability. While Samsonite offers excellent options at lower price points, its zippers and materials often lack the sturdy, lifetime feel I experienced with Briggs & Riley. As for Tumi, its sturdy builds come close, but the price hikes for newer models feel harder to justify, especially without a warranty comparable to this brand’s lifetime guarantee. Briggs & Riley offers compression technology that’s a step above Tumi’s designs.

That said, TravelPro Platinum Elite comes close. While lighter and more affordable, it sacrifices some durability, and its wheels don’t glide as effortlessly as this carry-on’s do on rough ground. For serious travelers, this Briggs & Riley luggage edges ahead.

**Value for Money**

Paying for premium carry-ons can feel daunting, but this model assures value through its performance and promising warranty. Its lasting design, paired with ingenious space considerations, makes it a worthy investment if smooth and stress-free travel is a priority. The added benefits, like compression technology and durable engineering, turn what could feel like splurging into smart spending in the luggage realm.

1m8bwkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheconnecterOfficial/comments/1m8bwkk/the_connecter_what_apple_did_for_the_iphone_were/,"The Connecter — What Apple Did for the iPhone, We’re Doing for Web3 Wallets","**Simplicity, Security, and Speed — All in One**

In 2007, Apple didn’t just launch a phone — it redefined how the world communicates, connects, and computes. With one elegant device, it replaced dozens of clunky tools. It brought the internet to your pocket, created new industries, and revolutionized user experience.

At **The Connecter**, we’re taking the same approach to **Web3 wallets**.

Because let’s be honest — crypto is powerful, but right now, it’s a mess.

# The Problem with Today’s Web3 Tools

For most people, using crypto today feels like learning a new language. Seed phrases, chains, bridges, wallets, gas fees — it’s overwhelming, fragmented, and risky. Even seasoned users juggle 5+ apps just to do basic tasks like buying, sending, or storing assets.

This friction is the single biggest reason the next billion users haven’t entered Web3.

# A Web3 Wallet That Just Works

**The Connecter** is changing that.

We’ve built a next-gen wallet that behaves like the best consumer fintech — not a clunky Web3 dashboard. Think of it as the **Apple Pay of crypto**, with one-click functionality, smart automations, and bank-level security.

Here's what sets us apart:

✅ **Buy Crypto at the Best Rates** – We aggregate top global fiat onramps so users always get the best deal, no matter where they are.

✅ **Save & Pay with Contacts** – Easily send or receive funds from anyone in your address book. No more copying long wallet addresses.

✅ **Seamless QR Payments** – Scan to pay instantly. Just like you’d tap your phone to buy coffee.

✅ **Seedless, Secure Access** – No more losing funds to lost seed phrases. We’re building wallet access that’s both user-friendly and non-custodial.

# This Isn’t Just a Wallet — It’s a Gateway

The Connecter isn’t just solving technical problems. We’re building a **new financial experience** for the mobile-first generation. One that’s borderless, interoperable, and radically inclusive.

From Lagos to Lisbon, from developers in Buenos Aires to freelancers in Manila — the next wave of crypto users won’t tolerate friction. They want fast, secure, elegant solutions. And that’s exactly what we’re delivering.

# Why It Matters

We believe Web3 won’t go mainstream through speculation. It will go mainstream when people use it every day — to send remittances, get paid for freelance gigs, shop, save, and thrive.

We’re not here to build for insiders.  
We’re building for everyone else.

# The Future Is Closer Than You Think

With early backing from top accelerators like **Google for Startups** and **AWS Startups**, and a growing network of partners, advisors, and early adopters — The Connecter is poised to become the **default interface to the decentralized economy**.

And just like Apple brought the internet to your fingertips…  
We’re bringing the power of Web3 to your pocket.

#### ⚠️ **Major Drama & Conflict**

* 🧨 **The Incredibly Awkward and Tense Stream Sniper Encounter (3:16:33 - 3:25:07 & 5:24:20)**
  A viewer, whose channel is ""Meaningless Rubbish,"" appears and confronts Daniel. The interaction is deeply uncomfortable and serves as the stream's dramatic peak.

  * 😔 **The Confrontation:** The viewer explains he tracked Daniel down to build his confidence, inspired by Daniel's ability to stream despite his own stated fears. He expresses frustration with his own life, mentioning his laptop broke, he only has five subscribers, and he hasn't had a job for almost two years **(3:23:25)**.
  * 😬 **Escalating Tension:** As the conversation progresses, the viewer becomes visibly and audibly disappointed with Daniel's reserved and nervous reaction. He remarks, ""I just thought it would be different really. I thought you'd talk... I just thought you'd be more, obviously not friendly, obviously... I'm kind of nervous too"" **(3:19:55)**.
  * 🫢 **The Aftermath:** After the viewer leaves, Bloodbucket notes how awkward it was. Daniel seems largely oblivious to the viewer's distress until Bloodbucket later explains, ""Why did he get mad at Daniel? ... Was he mad at you? Yeah, really. Like honestly pissed off"" **(5:24:20)**.

* 💔 **Relationship Drama: Girlfriend's Jealousy Over Sunny (29:34 & 32:07)**

  * 🧠 He reads a Reddit post from the ""Abroad in Japan"" subreddit titled, ""Should Crispy be worried about this stalker?"" and defensively asks, ""Why are they calling me a stalker? ... Why am I the stalker but everyone else is just a fan coming up to say hi?"" **(5:57)**.
  * 🤬 He reads a deluge of negative comments calling him an ""actual creep,"" ""loser,"" and a ""sick and deranged stalker"" **(9:34, 13:10)**.
  * 🔥 He worries that Chris's viewers are planning to get his channel ""striked"" **(11:03)** and feels ""a bit of heat"" from the backlash **(38:17)**. His video of the encounter has received 70% dislikes **(39:00)**.

* 🕵️‍♀️ **Paranoia and Vague Threats from ""Pineapple Pizza Lady"" (17:16 & 35:00)**

1m8bqxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m8bqxd/explore_the_breville_precision_brewer_and_its/,Explore the Breville Precision Brewer and Its Unique Coffee Modes!,"Breville BDC400BSS1BUS1 came into my kitchen a few months ago, and, as a coffee enthusiast, I was pretty excited to test it out. I’ve brewed coffee daily with this drip coffee maker, and while it’s undoubtedly a capable machine, there’s a mix of outstanding features and a few areas where it doesn’t quite hit the mark. Here's my take on it, along with some friendly banter about how it fits into daily coffee routines.

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, this coffee maker screams premium. Its brushed stainless steel finish gives it a refined, modern aesthetic that blends perfectly into my kitchen. It's not just about looks; the build feels sturdy, with no flimsy components. Measuring 6.7"" deep, 12.4"" wide, and 15.7"" high, it takes up a decent chunk of counter space, so if your kitchen real estate is limited, you might need to reconsider. That said, its glass carafe and thoughtfully positioned controls were intuitive even for my mom, who’s not a gadget person.

**Performance and Brewing Modes**  
This is where the magic happens—or most of it, anyway. The six unique brewing modes offer plenty of variety. My personal favorites are the Gold mode (certified by the Specialty Coffee Association) and the Cold Brew mode. Gold mode takes care of just about everything for you with precise water temperature and brewing times, delivering quality café-style coffee. Iced and Strong modes came in clutch during work-from-home summer days. Being able to tweak the brew temperature, flow rate, and bloom time under My Brew setting makes it a fantastic choice for anyone who likes to experiment. Although, let me be honest, learning what “bloom time” meant sent me spiraling through coffee forums for an hour!

[Find the best price for Breville BDC400BSS1BUS1 on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b07dmbyh4s/)

**Customizability Masterpiece**  
Admittedly, I geeked out about the adjustability this brewer offers. Most coffee makers stick to presets, but here, I could fiddle around with flow rates and brewing temperatures to match different coffee beans. On a whim, I decided to use a fruitier roast and altered the settings—it was like drinking liquid sunshine! If you enjoy experimenting and nerding out over coffee science, this machine is made for you. But, I’d caution folks who prefer simplicity; it might feel like overkill.

**Key Benefits**  
- Offers six brewing modes, including Cold Brew and Iced Coffee.  
- Features precise digital temperature control and adjustable flow rates.  
- Includes dual filter baskets for a wide range of brewing preferences.  
- Steep-and-release technology optimizes small quantities without the carafe.  

**Negatives to Note**  
- Manual operation may intimidate casual coffee drinkers.  
- Larger footprint isn’t optimal for small kitchens.  
- Requires periodic cleaning and maintenance more frequently than simpler models.  

**Accessories and Components**  
You get more than just the machine with this one. The package includes a coffee spoon, mesh basket filter, cone filter insert, a pack of flat-bottom paper filters, a water hardness test strip, and a cleaning brush. I liked the inclusion of multiple filter types, particularly for someone keen to try brewing variations. However, the filters’ maintenance can be a chore. You’ll need to clean the mesh basket filter regularly, which became a bit of a routine.   

**Alternative Products**  
When considering coffee makers in the same tier, Technivorm’s Moccamaster immediately sprung to mind. Its build quality matches Breville, and it excels in simplicity, brewing a solid pot without requiring much input. However, unlike Breville, it lacks customization options and isn’t compatible with pour-over adapters. Another alternative could be the Bonavita Connoisseur; it’s more compact and includes a pre-infusion mode, but again, you sacrifice versatility for the sake of simplicity. The Breville Precision Brewer manages to outshine its rivals by being incredibly versatile, adapting to different coffee styles or preferences better than most machines I’ve tried.

**Smart Spending**  
The price point of this coffee machine sits higher than many standard drip coffee makers, but its advanced features justify the cost for a specific group of people. For regular coffee drinkers who are content with basic brews, it might feel excessive. However, for craft coffee lovers who want full control and the ability to experiment, this is an excellent way to elevate your at-home coffee experience. So, do I think it’s worth it? If coffee is part of your daily vibe and precision is your jam, then yes, this machine is worth the splurge.

1m8bpas,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1m8bpas/uncover_the_ticonn_4ft_washing_machine_hose_set/,Uncover the TICONN 4FT Washing Machine Hose Set review: Is it reliable?,"The TICONN 4FT Washing Machine Hose Set (item model number B0C4H61PBJ) has been a regular part of my laundry routine for the past few weeks, and I’ve developed a solid opinion about its performance. Let me walk you through my honest experience with these braided stainless steel hoses—an accessory I never thought I’d care about enough to write this much about!

**Durability and Build Quality**  
These hoses are built with a premium braided 304 stainless steel exterior, featuring EPDM rubber cores and brass nuts. Right away, I could tell they’re crafted to last, and my first impression of their durability was quite solid. During installation, they felt sturdy in hand but thankfully not overly rigid. This balance between strength and flexibility might be their most underrated feature. The build quality reassured me that they’re unlikely to crack, burst, or kink under pressure. At 250 PSI, they’ve been tested for extreme conditions, so they give me confidence that catastrophe won’t strike while I’m having coffee upstairs.

[Check TICONN B0C4H61PBJ price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0c4h61pbj/)  

**Easy Installation Process**  
The universal ¾"" FHT connector really simplifies things. I had no need for extra adapters to connect them to my washer or water supply. Even for someone who isn’t super handy, attaching these took under 10 minutes. The standout feature here is definitely the 90-degree elbow design. This little addition saves precious space behind the washing machine while preventing damage to the hoses by keeping them from poking out awkwardly. Plus, they come color-coded—blue for cold water and red for hot—which is surprisingly helpful when setting them up quickly.

**Performance in Daily Use**  
In operation, these washing machine hoses have impressed me so far. The wide-opening design works as promised, allowing my washer to fill faster than it did with my old rubber hoses. While I never timed my washer’s fill cycle before, the difference in speed is definitely noticeable. You wouldn’t think hose performance could improve laundry efficiency, but here we are. As for water pressure, they handle it like pros. Some reviews online mentioned minor leaks with faulty connectors, but mine have been leak-free so far.

**Key Benefits**  
- Flexible design resists kinking and bursting.  
- Universal fitting makes compatibility easy.  
- 90-degree elbow optimizes space usage.  

**Potential Drawbacks**  
Every product has room for improvement, and while these hoses hit most of the key marks, there are limitations.  
- Some might find the stainless steel exterior slightly stiff during installation.  
- The packaging lacks any instructions for absolute beginners.  

**Safety Features**  
Safety was a major concern for me since washer hoses are notorious for water damage disasters. These have passed stringent water pressure tests up to 250 PSI and are labeled as lead-free and UPC certified. Knowing that these hoses prioritize health and safety lets me sleep easier—literally.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to traditional rubber hoses, these stainless steel hoses are leagues ahead in durability. Similar products in this price range, like the SharkBite hoses, lack the 90-degree elbow feature. However, others like the Eastman products offer comparable durability but come at slightly higher price points. That said, the TICONN hoses stand out with user-friendly touches like the color-coded design and limited liability warranty.

**Value Proposition**  
With its impressive materials and space-saving design, this product delivers great **value for money** in its category. While some cheaper hoses might get the job done temporarily, these feel like an investment that could save you from much bigger problems down the line (no pun intended). Add in the 5-year limited warranty, and the value starts to really add up.

I don’t really know what to call you anymore. Do I still have the right to give you one of those random, funny names I used to? It’s been two years since we last talked and after you left, no one ever called me “crybaby” again, not even once.

I know you were never one for poetry, and maybe I don’t have the right to express myself this way. But funny how that works 
a non-poetry person and a secretly poetic mess like me. Match made in some weird corner of the universe, right?

How’s La Trobe? How’s the barista job treating you? I remember how you loved making coffee like your exact style, your exact cup. I still remember how you used to tease me for smelling like coffee. I still have that coffee bean perfume, by the way. Haven’t touched the last drops. Feels like if I use them up, I’d be letting go of you for real.

Do you ever think of me when you make your best cup? I don’t expect you to, I never did. I always wanted you to move on. But somewhere deep inside, there’s this silent voice begging you not to forget me.

I’m sorry for walking away when I needed you most. I’m laughing right now because… maybe we were never really in love. But then again, do you really think it was just friendship? Didn’t it feel like something more?

I was scared- scared that I wasn’t the girl you imagined, the one you deserved. So I hid parts of me. I thought if you knew everything, you’d leave and I didn’t think I could survive that. I know I sound dramatic, but the weight never left. I’ve cried without sound, clutching my chest, just wishing for a proper goodbye. Or maybe one last laugh with you.

There’s so much I still wonder about how your handwriting would look in a love letter, how your voice sounds when you hum your favorite song, and how you smile watching someone you love smile. I always wondered how you handled those corners -were you the smooth, one-handed steering type or more of a sharp-turn drifter? How you hid your pain and just kept listening to my nonsensical chatters to cure my pain instead.  Do our late night 3 hours long convos ever cross your mind? Has it ever hit you we could be a different thing?

I memorized your favorite songs. And every time I hear them, it’s like I’m lost in translation somewhere in Melbourne, in your arms, rain pouring down, me whispering apologies for every small hurt, and you laughing it off: “It’s okay, shit happens. You want a coffee?”

Do you do those things with her now? Does she laugh like I did? Does she have little lies and secrets like mine? Do you call her crybaby when she gets emotional over small things? I guess I was your chaos, your Grace who ruined everything, right?

Maybe I didn’t matter that much to you. Maybe I was just another girl. But I remember the day we met — October 26, 2022. I remember every word of that chat, the song by Blue Jeans we talked about. How wild it was to end up in the same city.

I even memorized your car’s plate number — not to follow you, just in the hope of seeing you one last time, on a cold night near Bailey Road.

I’m not in love with you now. I ended it in my mind, consciously because I thought you’d hate the real me. Or maybe I was just afraid because you always seemed too perfect, and I… never was.

I miss your dark humor, your family rants, the random check-ins. I adopted your words. I still order your favorite coffee. And yes I looked for a pink garage like yours. Just once, I wanted to see you before letting go.

Maybe I was always too sentimental. Maybe you never felt anything like I did. But your secrets are safe with me. Do you still remember mine? How’s your nephew now? He must be almost three. Do you still smoke Esse Lights? (Don’t be a chain-smoker — I still care.)

I guess things happen for a reason, right? But I still crave closure.

I once called you from an unknown number. Wanted to say everything. But I chickened out. I ended up just asking “How are you?” and when you said “Good,” I said “Bye.” You asked “Who are you?” and I hung up. Ego won. I didn’t want to sound desperate. I didn’t want to ruin what you have now.

I see you happy, and I’m glad. I really am. She’s probably the girl you always wanted.

But do you remember the night I told you, “Everything’s going to be alright,” when you were at your lowest? One of us made it out okay. I’m still stuck. But I’m happy you didn’t get stuck with someone as messy as me. Still, I talk to you in my head. I never regret meeting you. Never will. In my head, you will be forever my favourite stranger. 

The world was cruel. And I knew someone like you couldn’t stay with someone like me. But if I ever see you again, I won’t call out to you. I’ll just whisper a prayer. Quietly. And wish I had told you — the day you asked why I cared so much about you—
“I cared because I loved you.”

Forever your crybaby,
but just in memory.

If you're wondering about the most beautiful drive on Oahu, this full-day journey around the island's perimeter is hands down the best way to see everything.

I initially planned to rent a car, but after doing some research, I realized I'd miss out on so much local knowledge and probably spend more time navigating than enjoying the views. The Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall turned out to be the perfect solution.

Starting from Waikiki early morning, our first stop was Diamond Head lookout. The morning light hitting the coastline was absolutely spectacular. Our guide shared fascinating stories about Hawaii's volcanic history while we took photos.

The drive along the eastern shore was breathtaking. The Halona Blowhole was impressive, but what really got me was the Nu'uanu Pali Lookout. The wind up there is intense, but the panoramic views of the Windward Coast are unreal. Our guide explained how this spot played a crucial role in Hawaiian history.

The North Shore portion of the drive was my favorite. We stopped at famous beaches like Sunset Beach, and I finally understood why this area is legendary among surfers. The massive waves were hypnotic to watch.

A highlight was Waimea Valley. The botanical garden walk leads to this gorgeous waterfall where you can actually swim. The water was refreshing, and the whole experience felt magical. Pro tip: bring your swimsuit and a quick-dry towel.

We also stopped at local fruit stands (the fresh coconut was amazing) and tried some North Shore garlic shrimp for lunch. The Dole Plantation stop was touristy but fun - you've got to try the Dole Whip.

If you want to experience this incredible journey yourself, I booked through this link: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island. The tour includes everything: transportation, garden admission, coffee tastings, and an expert guide. It's really the most efficient way to see the island's highlights in one day.

The entire circuit took about 8 hours, but it felt just right. Our guide's local knowledge made all the difference - they knew exactly when to hit each spot to avoid crowds and get the best photos.

For anyone planning to visit Oahu, don't miss this opportunity to see the island's diverse landscapes. From volcanic formations to tropical forests, from historic sites to hidden beaches, this drive showcases everything that makes Oahu special. Book early though - these tours fill up fast, especially during peak season.

The best part? You can just relax and take in the views instead of worrying about navigation or parking. Considering everything that's included, it's excellent value for money and definitely the highlight of my Hawaiian vacation.",1,1753380124.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

Something Is Emerging,"The warning came over the city works truck radio. It was early, the sky still dark. The voice said all civilians should immediately evacuate areas near cemeteries. No explanation. No deadline. Just the mechanical, repetitive tone of a message that seemed to already know no one would listen to it all.

I listened to the end. And I stayed.

Not out of stubbornness. Not out of courage. I stayed because... this is my job. Ever since I moved to rural Minnesota, I've been responsible for taking care of St. Elgin's Cemetery. No one else wanted it. Too quiet. Too isolated. Too dead. But it was everything I was looking for. Peace. Silence. Routine.

I never thought the world could get quieter than it is here. But after that alert, the silence changed shape. It became... heavy. As if the very air was trying to hide something from me.

That morning, I walked to the cemetery gate and looked down the road. There were no cars. Not even the birds were singing. The world seemed to be waiting for me to be the last one to leave. And I didn't.

I decided to record everything. I grabbed my old recorder, the same one I use to log grave locations. I started talking. First to myself. Then... to something I can't name.

The soil was dry, but it left marks as if someone had walked on it during the night. The graves seemed deeper than yesterday. And, I swear, one of the angel statues had changed the position of its hands.

I don't know what's happening. But I can tell you what I saw. What I heard. And what I buried — or what I thought I buried. I know this recording might never be heard by anyone. Or maybe it will be heard by someone who isn't quite human anymore. Either way, this needs to be said.

They're standing now. And they remember.

My name is Thomas Reid. I was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, but I've lived in the United States for almost twenty years. I've never been a big-city person. I always felt better surrounded by empty spaces, seldom-used trails, open skies. When I saw the Grey Hollow city council's ad looking for a caretaker for the local cemetery, I didn't think twice. No one else wanted the job. The place was old, far from town, too small to justify a team of employees. But for me, it was perfect.

St. Elgin's is at the end of a back road, surrounded by dense pine forest and a dry lake to the west. The iron gate doesn't close properly anymore, and the stone wall has gaps in some sections, but it's never been a problem. No one came here without a reason. And those who did usually just wanted to talk for a few minutes with someone who no longer responded.

My house is in the back. It's a simple, single-story building with three rooms. It has running water, electricity, and a fireplace that works well in winter. At night, I usually make tea, read a book, or listen to the radio until I fall asleep. I've always liked routine. The cemetery taught me to respect time. To accept what doesn't return. And to speak little.

My daily tasks included cutting the weeds between the graves, cleaning the headstones, fixing fences, and painting the tool shed once in a while. Sometimes a family would show up for a visit. I'd nod in greeting and go back to my work. It was like living inside a paused calendar. Nothing changed. And I didn't feel the need for change either.

But a few weeks ago... things started to go awry.

I'm not talking about major events. Not yet. But small details. Subtle, almost imperceptible things. The crows, for example. There had always been crows here, perched in the trees around the cemetery. Always watching, as if they were part of the place's ritual. And then, one day, they simply vanished. No sound. No feathers on the ground. As if they had received a warning before us.

Another detail: the smell. The morning air always had the same cold, slightly damp scent of cut grass. But it started to have a different odor. Something like the soil itself was breathing. It was subtle, but constant. I tried to ignore it. I told myself it was my imagination, maybe some unexpected decomposition. But that feeling wouldn't go away. It was as if I was being watched. Not by someone. But by the place itself.

I kept working. Routine was all I had. Until I got that alert on the truck radio. And everything changed.

The first thing that truly made me stop what I was doing happened two days before the national alert. It was a warm afternoon, clear sky, and I was closing a new grave in the east section. The burial had been simple, no family present. A man with no relatives, donated by the local hospital. Just me, the priest, and the sealed coffin. Nothing out of the ordinary.

I buried him as usual, covering the grave with fresh earth and settling the temporary wooden cross. I left, thinking about what I'd make for dinner. But the next morning, when I returned to check on the job, I noticed something wrong.

There were marks on the dirt. Finger marks. Not footprints, not animal tracks.

\*\*\*

These were five parallel scratches, curved as if a hand had pressed the soil from the inside out. I stared at them for a few seconds. I tried to rationalize: maybe the soil was unstable, maybe a root was pushing up the dirt. But when I knelt to examine it more closely, I felt the heat.

The surface of the grave was warm. Not lukewarm. Hot. As if something had been buried alive and was still trying to get out.

I took a step back. I looked around. No sound. No sign of animals. Even so, I decided to dig a little, just to make sure nothing was out of place. I slowly inserted the shovel, removed the first layer of earth... and stopped. The coffin was there. Intact. No cracks. But the heat... the heat was coming from inside it.

I stood there, shovel in hand, trying to decide whether or not to open it. In the end, I decided to leave it be. I sealed the earth again. I wrote down the grave number. And I went home with my stomach churning.

At night, I had trouble sleeping. It wasn't fear, exactly. It was a different feeling, as if I had forgotten something important. As if someone had told me a secret I couldn't remember. The kind of feeling you try to push to the back of your mind, but that comes back every time you close your eyes.

Around two in the morning, I got out of bed and went to the porch. The cemetery, illuminated by the faint light of the streetlamp, seemed peaceful. No movement. No sound.

Then I heard it.

Three dry thuds, coming from the direction of the old mausoleum. It was a muffled, rhythmic sound. As if someone was knocking from inside the concrete wall. I stood motionless. My first instinct was to find a logical explanation: maybe it was the wind, maybe a tree had fallen. But the sound was specific. Controlled. Almost... polite.

I went to the kitchen, grabbed my flashlight, and went back outside. I walked slowly to the mausoleum. The iron door was locked, as always. I shined the flashlight over it. No signs of forced entry. No cracks. I touched the surface. It was cold. Everything seemed normal.

But when I turned to leave, I heard a different sound. A whisper. I couldn't understand what it said, but it sounded like my name. Not spoken, exactly. More like it had been projected inside my head. Something short. Sibilant. Almost familiar.

I went back to the house without looking back. I locked the door. I closed the curtains. And I sat there until dawn, with the light on, my heart heavy, and my mind trying to construct explanations that made sense.

The next morning, I restarted the recording. It was the first time I had recorded an event I didn't want to forget.

Or maybe... something I didn't want to make me forget.

After that night, I started paying attention to the small things. To the pauses between tasks, to the silences that lasted too long, to the patterns that, little by little, began to break apart.

First, it was the radio. I left it on in the truck while cleaning the chapel steps. I always listened to a local news station, more out of habit than interest. But that day, the transmission cut out mid-sentence and never came back. I tried changing stations, but all were covered in static — except one. A single frequency broadcast a looped recording. The same voice from the alert I'd heard before. Monotonous, robotic, repeating: ""Evacuate immediately. Maintain a one-kilometer distance from any permanent resting area. This is not a test.""

I left the radio on anyway. The sound was unsettling, but there was something worse in the silence.

Next was my cell phone. No signal. No bars, no network. I tried restarting it, climbing to a higher point, even driving the truck to the main road entrance. Nothing. It was as if the outside world had shut down. Only no one told me.

I went back to the cemetery, trying to convince myself it was just a local problem. A solar flare. A blackout. Something that reason could explain. But with each passing day, the explanations grew weaker.

On Wednesday, I prepared the burial of a man named Charles Manning. He had died in a nursing home, with no family. The body was sent in a simple coffin. I did the service alone. I buried him, placed the cross with his name and date. Everything as usual.

The next morning, the grave was there, but there was no name on the cross. No Charles, no date, nothing. Just raw wood. I thought the wind or rain might have erased it, but the surface was too clean, no marks, no signs of wear.

\*\*\*

As if that cross had never been written on. As if I had never performed that burial. I decided to check the record in my notebook. But the corresponding page was also blank. The space between the previous day and the next day existed — the paper was there — but there were no notes. Not even a faint pen mark. The day, somehow, had been erased.

I went to the chapel to look for the archives. I opened the register book and looked for Charles's name. Nothing. No mention. I looked for the documents that came with the coffin. The medical chart. The death certificate. All gone.

I started to feel disoriented. It wasn't just a mistake. It was as if someone — or something — was correcting reality in real-time, undoing the small proofs that that person had existed. And not just that... as if it was also testing how much I would notice.

At night, I went to check the stone statues that decorated the cemetery entrance. There were three angels, one on each side and a central one. They had always been there. But something was different. The position of their arms had changed. The central angel, who held a torch aloft, now held the torch downwards. As if indicating that the light had gone out. I stood watching for minutes. I tried to remember if I had seen it like this before. I couldn't. I started to doubt my own memory.

In the early hours, I began to hear constant noises: muffled groans, light footsteps on dry leaves, the sound of someone breathing very close to my window, although outside there were only pine trees.

One of the most repeated sounds was like a shovel hitting the ground. But not the way a human digs. It was more irregular. Slower. As if something was trying to dig with its hands. I recorded several of these nights. But when I listened to the tapes, the sound was always distorted, as if the recorder was picking up a different frequency, a layer below human hearing.

On the fifth day, I went to check Charles's coffin. I dug until I found it. But the space was empty. No body. No box. Just loose dirt, as if it had never been filled. The cross was still there, blank, pointing to a void that shouldn't exist.

There were no signs of excavation. Not even disturbed roots. It was as if the ground had opened on its own, swallowed the contents, and then closed carefully.

That night, I turned off all the lights and sat in the dark. The world outside my window seemed to move strangely, as if breathing slowly. The shadows were longer. And for a second, I thought I saw someone standing among the graves. Not a blur. A motionless silhouette, looking towards my house.

I went to the door and yelled: ""Who's there?!""

Silence.

Then I heard that whisper again. The same one from the mausoleum night.

This time, I understood what it said: ""You have a place too.""

After hearing that whisper, I found myself forced to confront what I had been avoiding: there was something here with me. Something that wasn't interested in hiding, but in getting me used to its presence. To the idea of it. And perhaps even to its voice.

My mind still tried to remain rational. Even after the distorted recordings, the disappearing records, the shapeshifting statues, I clung to the idea that there was an explanation. Maybe a psychotic break. Prolonged isolation. Poisoning by some gas. But deep down... I knew it wasn't that.

I needed proof. Some confirmation. So I did what I thought was most logical: I went back to the chapel archives, this time looking for old gravediggers. There was a wooden box, buried under dust and termites, with old notebooks. Handwritten accounts by men who had done exactly what I was doing now — cleaning, burying, recording, and above all... observing.

Most of the notes were mundane. Dates, names, simple repairs. But in one of the notebooks, signed by a certain Matthew Corrigan, I found something different.

He wrote about night noises. About voices that imitated dead relatives. About graves that ""breathed."" He used that word: breathe. And on one of the last pages, there was a sentence underlined three times:

""Never sleep less than ten paces from the old ground. It dreams more than we do.""

I slowly closed the notebook. The ink was faded, but still legible. The fear, on the other hand, was alive in that handwriting.

I went home feeling like I wasn't the first. That perhaps no one in that position had left there whole. If they left at all.

I decided to set up cameras. I took two old security cameras, hooked them up to an isolated system, and positioned one at the cemetery entrance and another facing the west section, where the mausoleum was. I set them to record during the early hours and left them running.

The next morning, I went to review the videos. The one at the entrance showed hours of darkness, nothing but the wind swaying the trees. But, around 3:17 AM, something appeared in the recording from the west section. It was hard to see in the dark, but there was movement among the graves. It wasn't an animal.

\*\*\*

It was an upright figure, thin, walking slowly, as if searching for something. But what chilled my blood was the position of its head. The figure walked forward, but with its head turned completely backward, as if its face was looking directly at the camera.

I paused the video. I increased the brightness. And I saw myself there. That thing had my face.

The recording became corrupted seconds later. The screen froze and, when it returned, the image only showed the empty field again. As if nothing had ever passed through there.

I rewound the segment at least ten times. Each time, the same sequence: the thing walking among the graves, head turned towards the camera, and my face staring... at myself.

I turned off the system, but I didn't delete the files. I put the memory cards in a locked drawer. Not because I wanted to preserve the evidence. But because I feared that if I deleted it, it would return another way.

That night, I decided I wouldn't sleep. I made strong coffee, left the lights on, and sat in front of the window, watching the cemetery outside. It was strange to think that the only thing separating me from that world was a thin pane of glass and the fact that I still considered myself alive.

But... how long would that remain true?

Shortly after two in the morning, I heard a sound coming from the porch. I went to the door with my flashlight. Something was there.

A recorder. Just like mine.

I picked it up carefully. I turned it on. The sound was static for a few seconds... then it started playing. My voice. Repeating the same phrase I had recorded two days earlier, right after burying Charles Manning.

But there was a difference.

The recording continued after the original phrase, as if someone had added something. And this second part was no longer my voice. It was a variation of it. Slower. More drawn out. As if someone was imitating my way of speaking, but without understanding the meaning behind the words. It said:

""You're doing this because you've done it before. And you'll do it again. We are memory. You are too.""

At that moment, I understood that perhaps nothing I was experiencing was new. That this cemetery didn't just hold bodies — but experiences. Repetitions. Copies. Echoes of everything that had been done there before. And I was just another sound repeating itself.

I sat back down, in silence. For the first time, I allowed myself to consider the idea that perhaps the evacuation warning wasn't to protect the living from the dead... but the living from themselves.

The next morning, I looked at my own house as if it were no longer mine. Nothing had moved, yet everything seemed displaced. As if the place had been rebuilt based on someone's memory of me — but without understanding the details. The kitchen chair was turned towards the wall. The bathroom mirror reflected my room, not the hallway. And the back door, which always creaked, now opened in absolute silence.

I went to the cemetery, trying to keep my head straight. The sky was overcast, but there was no rain in the forecast. The air seemed suspended, as if the world was holding its breath. I walked among the graves with the recorder in my pocket. I recorded the sound of my footsteps, the rustling of leaves... and something else. A deep, constant sound. A kind of subterranean rumble. It was as if the ground itself was vibrating.

I reached the mausoleum. The door, previously locked with chains, was ajar. No sign of forced entry. I pushed it open slowly. The darkness inside seemed denser than it should be. As if the air didn't move, as if it absorbed light. I turned on my flashlight. The inner walls were covered with marks. They weren't scribbles or symbols. They were words. Hundreds of them. All with the same name: Thomas Reid.

Written in different sizes, different handwritings. Some shaky, others firm. All identical to my name.

My body froze. I tried to rationalize. Hallucination. Delusion. Someone playing a trick. But then I looked at the ceiling. There, in larger letters, it was written:

""You bury yourself every time you try to leave.""

I ran. My heart felt like it was beating outside my chest. I went back home, locked all the doors. I grabbed the memory cards, the old notebooks, my recordings — everything. I needed to understand.

I started listening to the audios again. But something had changed. In almost every track, my voice had been overlaid by another, lower, drier, like a delayed echo. But it didn't repeat the words — it commented. As if something was accompanying me while I recorded and leaving notes for itself.

In one of the recordings, as I described the blank cross on Charles's grave, the other voice whispered:

""Charles never existed. It was just a name to prepare you.""

With each new file, more sections with these intrusions appeared. Names, phrases, dates... all being denied. As if everything I had done was a staged act. As if I was living an earlier version of my own story.

\*\*\*

At three seventeen in the morning, something woke up. It wasn't a sound. It was an absence. As if the whole world had paused for a second, and only I was conscious. I got out of bed as if pulled. I went to the window. Someone was at the gate. Or... something.

It was my shape. Same size. Same hair. But the face wasn't exactly mine. It was as if it had been drawn from bad memories. Details were missing. The eyes were too wide. The smile, fixed, as if someone had pasted a human expression onto a clay face. And then it — I — spoke.

But the lips didn't move. The voice came from inside my head, like the whisper from before, only clearer now:

""You stay here because you already know the end.""

I tried to blink, to move away from the window. But I couldn't. The whole world seemed frozen. Only I and that thing moved. It — that thing — turned slowly and pointed to the ground. And at that moment, I felt it.

My body grew heavy. A weight that came from within, from my gut. As if I was being pulled down. I knelt on the living room floor, feeling a pressure rise through my legs. I was being pushed. Not by hands. But by memories. By layers and layers of memory that weren't mine... but that recognized me anyway.

I screamed. But the sound died before it left my throat.

And then, everything returned. Time, sound, light. The figure at the gate was gone. But the footprints were still on the wet earth. And on the floor of my house, where I had knelt, there was dirt. Fresh. Dark. As if my knees had sunk a few inches.

In the recording from that night, my voice doesn't appear. Only the sound of something breathing. Deep. Continuous. As if an open mouth was very close to the microphone. At the end of the audio, there's a phrase, spoken with my exact intonation:

""You're already inside.""

After that night, something inside me changed. I don't know exactly when, or how, but I started to see the cemetery differently. No longer as a place of rest. But as a network. A field of buried pulsation, alive and watchful.

During the day, I walked through the graves with a notebook in hand, trying to organize the dates, names, and records. I wanted to build a timeline. But I discovered something else: many of the names repeated. Thomas. Reid. Matthew. Corrigan. They always returned, sometimes as deceased, others as gravediggers, gardeners, even as ""witnesses."" As if they were versions of the same figure, dragged through time by some blind force.

I went back to the chapel. I examined the stained glass windows. In one of them, I noticed a strange pattern: a man in a hat digging a hole, watched by shadowed figures behind gravestones. The man's face was damaged by time, but the silhouette... it was mine. The same coat. The same haircut. The same way he held the shovel.

And that's when I understood.

I wasn't the first to record this. And I'm not recording it for the first time. This account isn't new. It's not original. It's just another version, another cycle, another echo among hundreds that have faded and returned.

The creature's words came back to my mind with greater clarity:

""You're doing this because you've done it before. And you'll do it again.""

My life, my name, my job here — all of it was a repetition. Not of memory, but of function. I was shaped to occupy this space. To witness, to record, and, in the end, to sink.

And perhaps... to accept.

I stopped fighting what I saw. I started listening to the subterranean sounds without fear. To hear the voices in the graves as if they were old acquaintances. At night, I slept with the door open. And I dreamed of wet earth covering my face. Not as a nightmare, but as a return.

In the recording I made today, my voice sounds calm. Lower. I say that I have understood that the cemetery is not just soil and stone. It is made of intention. Of history. Of mistakes. And of remembrance. Every body buried here is not dead — it is being preserved. Like pages of a book that insists on being read, even by eyes that have already forgotten it.

And I... I'm just another sentence in that book.

It's night now.

I don't know which night, or how many have passed. The clock on the wall stopped at 3:17 and refuses to move. I've stopped trying to adjust it. It's as if time here has given up trying to imitate the world outside.

I'm sitting in the living room chair with the recorder in my hands. The same one as always. But it's different. Heavier. The red light that indicates recording is on, even when it's off. I no longer know if it's me recording... or if I'm just the sound being recorded.

Outside, the graves are silent. But the silence now speaks. It pulsates. If anyone listens to this audio, perhaps they will hear it too. A faint rhythm. Like a crowd breathing in unison, beneath the earth.

I recorded everything.

And if you're listening... maybe it's already too late.

The last thing I remember saying was that same phrase. On another tape. In another voice.

\*\*\*

And the recorder keeps repeating, as if there were no beginning or end, only the middle — that space between what we were and what we buried.

I think I'm ready.

I’m in my mid 40’s female, newly divorced mom of teens (hence time with shared 50-50 parenting time) and a 7 year old rescue bully dog I want to take him out to explore more. He’ll undergo chemotherapy soon and I want to spoil him.  

I love interesting coffee places, interesting places to take photographs, and besides the obvious well known or popular places. I also want to hear about hole in the wall spots. Like my friend was telling me about Lake Mohawk in NJ with a cute town. 

I’m ok with short 2-4 hours trips but also day long exploration too.

1m8bh6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m8bh6z/does_the_mr_coffee_12cup_programmable_coffee/,Does the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker live up to expectations? Review,"The Mr. Coffee JWX31-RB 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker is more than just your average kitchen appliance; it’s a daily companion for someone like me who needs coffee to function. Whether I’m brewing a quick cup in the morning rush or setting it up for a lazy Sunday afternoon, this coffee maker has slotted itself into my routine with ease. With its sleek stainless steel design and user-friendly programmable features, it’s clear why it lands in the kitchens of so many coffee enthusiasts. However, perfection might be a slight exaggeration, so let’s dive into the good and the not-so-good aspects of this machine.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
What stands out right away is the stainless steel aesthetic. It fits flawlessly into a modern kitchen setup, and its compact dimensions—9.15"" D x 11.2"" W x 14.5"" H—ensure it doesn’t dominate the counter. At just under 5 pounds, relocating this coffee maker is straightforward. The button-based controls are intuitive, making it painless for anyone in my household, even my tech-averse parents, to operate it. The removable filter basket is a game-changer for cleaning; no more awkwardly trying to rinse out hard-to-reach areas. Still, I did notice some smudges on the stainless steel finish after regular use, which means frequent wiping down is mandatory to keep it looking pristine.  

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
I’ve used drip coffee makers before, but the difference with this one is the consistency. It brews a full 12 cups of coffee without compromising on flavor. The Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause feature is something I can’t live without now. There’s something immensely satisfying about sneaking a cup while the machine is mid-brew, especially when deadlines are looming. It operates quietly, which is particularly nice during early mornings. The coffee stays warm without tasting burnt, thanks to its thoughtful 2-hour automatic shut-off feature. However, the machine struggles a bit when brewing smaller quantities, as the taste doesn’t have the same richness compared to fuller batches.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Elegant stainless steel design enhances any kitchen aesthetic.  
- Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause feature comes in handy for impatient coffee lovers.  
- Programmable Delay Brew ensures coffee is ready when you want it.  
- Removable filter basket simplifies cleanup.  

[Check Mr. Coffee JWX31-RB price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0041847t2/)  

**Negatives**  
While this coffee maker has been a lifesaver, it’s far from perfect.  

- The stainless steel surface tends to attract fingerprints and smudges.  
- Brewing smaller amounts of coffee somewhat impacts flavor richness.  
- The power cord storage is practical, but the cord itself feels a little short.  

**Ease of Use and Programmable Features**  
Programming this coffee maker is a breeze. The Delay Brew feature has officially spoiled me; waking up to the aroma of fresh coffee feels downright luxurious. Once, I forgot to set it for the next day, and going back to manually brewing felt like a chore. Another important detail worth highlighting is the easy cord storage system, which keeps the counter looking tidy. However, the cord length feels just a tad shorter than expected. If your kitchen outlets are oddly placed like mine, you might need to make some adjustments.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
The special cleaning cycle on this machine makes maintenance straightforward. I don’t even need fancy cleaning supplies—water and a bit of vinegar do the trick. However, it’s worth noting that keeping the stainless steel smudge-free does require regular attention. The reusable filter is also a nice eco-friendly touch, although it takes some patience to clean it thoroughly after brewing multiple batches.  

**Competing Products**  
If you’re considering alternatives, some solid options in the programmable coffee maker category include the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 Perfectemp and Hamilton Beach 46205. The Cuisinart model, while offering a similar 12-cup capacity, boasts adjustable brew strength and a hotter temperature for brewing. However, it’s notably pricier and slightly bulkier on the counter. The Hamilton Beach model bridges affordability and function with its removable water reservoir but lacks the sophisticated stainless steel look of the Mr. Coffee machine. The JWX31-RB stands out for its balance of aesthetics, functionality, and price, making it an attractive medium-ground option in its league.  

**Price Performance**  
This coffee maker doesn’t feel overpriced for what it delivers. It offers core features like programmability, ease of cleaning, and a solid household design at a price point that doesn’t pinch the wallet too hard. While it’s not the cheapest option, it strikes a solid middle ground for anyone looking to upgrade from basic coffee machines into something more feature-rich. For those that prioritize simplicity without splurging on extra bells and whistles, this product feels smartly positioned in the market.

My partner and I are taking a road trip through the Kootenays next week, and I’d love your suggestions to make our itinerary even better. We’re looking for **must-see attractions, gluten-free restaurant recommendations, and hike or paddleboard ideas** we might have missed.

# Calgary → Fernie

We’re leaving after work, so the plan is to set up camp when we arrive, grab a bite in town, or check out Fernie Distillers.  
  
Morning: Stroll through downtown Fernie, grab coffee, and maybe squeeze in a short adventure.  
**Looking for:** A recommendation for a short morning hike or scenic walk before we hit the road.

# Fernie → Creston → Lockhart Beach

On the way, we plan to stop in Creston and visit Baillie-Grohmann and Red Bird Winery, unless there are other must-visit wineries you'd recommend. 🍷 We’re also debating a quick stop at Columbia Brewery or Sternwheeler Distillery.

We’ll spend the night at Lockhart Beach Provincial Park and drive Highway 3A, checking out the Glass House.  
**Looking for:** Gluten free lunch options, short hikes or nice walks nearby and suggestions for other things to do that day.

# Nelson → Kaslo

We’ll take the ferry to Nelson and spend the day exploring before heading to Kaslo for the night for the Kaslo Jazz Fest!  
**Looking for:** Recommendations on how to spend a perfect day in Nelson—cafes, cool shops, local eats, or hidden gems. Also, is it worth trying Mt. Loki here, or should we save hiking for the next day?

# Kaslo → Argenta

The next morning we’ll explore Kaslo before heading to Grandma’s Farm in Argenta.  
**Looking for:** Things to do in Kaslo during the day—any favorite hikes, paddleboard spots, or unique attractions? Is a visit to the SS Moyie or the Cody Caves worth it?  

# Argenta → Nakusp

We’ll be in Argenta for a short stay, planning a hike—MacBeth Icefield and Jumbo Mountain were on the list, but it seems MacBeth is still closed. 😔 We’re also considering a stop in Sandon - seems like a cool ghost town!.

# Nakusp → Calgary

We have two days in Nakusp to wrap up the trip—one day for a solid hike, the other for hot springs.  
**Looking for:** Which is best—Halcyon, Nakusp Hot Springs, or Halfway Hot Springs?

**Hiking Plans & Questions**

Since MacBeth Icefields is closed, we’ll definitely do Jumbo Mountain, but between Mt. Loki, Saddle Mountain, or Monica Meadows, which is your favorite (views, difficulty, and overall vibe)? Or would you recommend something else entirely?

Any other **hidden gems, viewpoints, gluten-free spots, or can’t-miss experiences** along this route? We love unique stops, local food/drink, and adventurous activities like **hiking or paddleboarding**.

1m8bb06,https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorsUK/comments/1m8bb06/a_story_of_success_how_we_overcame_management_and/,A story of success: how we overcame management and nurses to secure a resident doctors' office (and it looks great!),"A familiar picture to many: our ward had no resident doctors' office. The available rooms had long been claimed by the senior nurse, ward manager, and various AHPs. Residents were left working in corridors, perched on the edge of the reception desk, fighting it out with nurses and HCPs for the few laptops on the ward. Year after year, residents voiced their frustrations, and year after year, nothing changed.

One year ago, our cohort decided to challenge this. We knew we’d rotate out before seeing the results, but that didn’t matter. Our motivation was to stand up for future residents and to push back against the quiet erosion of our profession’s value.

***1.⁠ ⁠Identify your allies***

Many consultants will voice support in principle, but far fewer are prepared to take action. Raise your concerns frequently, collectively, and ideally one-on-one, preferably over coffee or lunch (*Tip #1*: *those who offer coffee or lunch are usually your strongest allies*). Ask to what extent they can support you, and how they would go about tackling this. As consultants, they’ll understand the system better than you, and their guidance is often invaluable.

***2.⁠ ⁠Identify your opposition, and listen to them***

Ask yourself: who stands to lose if residents gain their own office? Speak to these colleagues. Listen carefully. Identify a realistic room for your office and understand their arguments against it. Don’t pick a fight; it’s in your interest to hear the best possible version of their position, so you can address it meaningfully.

***3.⁠ ⁠Write a strong, structured proposal email***

Clearly outline the case for a residents' office and present your proposed solution. *Tip #2: use language and frameworks that demand a response*. Our key arguments were:

\- Confidentiality breaches from patient discussions in public areas, a clinical governance issue

\- Occupational health concerns from residents working in unsafe or unsuitable environments, a breach of health and safety regulations

\- Workplace inefficiencies, including the daily battle for laptops and repeated logouts, versus the benefits of co-located residents working collaboratively

We proposed repurposing a room nominally designated as a “relatives room”, though in reality it had become a dumping ground. The matron was furious, arguing it was disrespectful to remove quiet spaces for families. Fortunately, we had been collecting photo evidence of the room’s condition throughout the year (see before photo), showing it had never been used for its intended purpose. That argument collapsed quickly. We then sent our proposal and supporting evidence to our supportive consultant, who forwarded it to the relevant managers.

***4.⁠ ⁠Act collectively, and be persistent***

We doubled down by submitting datix reports for every instance where patient confidentiality was breached in corridors, every time a relative walked past our screens - a data security risk - and every time we sat on anything other than a proper chair, raising health and safety concerns. *Tip #3: managers who ignore your reasoned, well-evidenced proposal will act swiftly once their inbox fills with datix notifications.*

***5.⁠ ⁠Possession is 9/10 of the law***

When the time comes, move in. As a team. Claim the room, rename it “Resident Doctors' Office,” and make yourselves easy to find. Be cooperative with ward staff, but hold the line.

It took 12 months for the room to be formally recognised, but we got there. Our supportive consultant ensured it was kitted out properly with enough computers, a fridge, and even a coffee machine! None of our original residents work there anymore, but it’s satisfying to see the new residents using the office we fought so hard to secure!

But what if you could boost your health, energy, and mood in just 7 minutes? Backed by science and embraced by time-strapped CEOs, this high-intensity circuit training method delivers real results without gym memberships or equipment.

https://preview.redd.it/y9h26j3luqef1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ed2b7d6e0e86592226c366033ac372409876369

The Science Behind 7 Minutes



A groundbreaking 2013 study published in the American College of Sports Medicine's Health & Fitness Journal, led by exercise physiologists Brett Klika and Chris Jordan, proved that short bursts of high-intensity exercise trigger metabolic changes comparable to much longer workouts. Participants doing the 7-minute protocol:



✔Increased VO2 max (oxygen efficiency) by 12% in 6 weeks

✔Reduced waist circumference by 2.5 cm on average

✔Improved insulin sensitivity by 28%



Tech entrepreneur Jason Fried, founder of Basecamp, swears by this method: ""It's my secret weapon for staying sharp during 16-hour workdays.""



The Perfect 7-Minute Sequence



This science-backed circuit alternates 30-second intense exercises with 10-second rests:



1. Jumping jacks (full-body warmup)

2. Wall sit (isometric strength)

3. Push-ups (upper body)

4. Abdominal crunch (core)

5. Step-ups (using a sturdy chair)

6. Squats (lower body)

7. Triceps dip (using chair)

8. Plank (core stability)

9. High knees (cardio boost)

10. Lunges (leg strength)

11. Push-up with rotation (advanced)

12. Side plank (obliques)



Why It Works



The University of Copenhagen's 2021 HIIT study (Dr. Jens Bangsbo) revealed that short bursts:



•Trigger EPOC (afterburn effect) burning calories for hours

•Increase human growth hormone production by 200%

•Improve cognitive function better than caffeine



Fashion designer Eileen Fisher, 72, maintains her legendary energy with daily 7-minute sessions: ""It's my non-negotiable morning ritual.""



Making It Stick



1. Schedule it - Set phone reminders for the same time daily

2. Track progress - Note improvements in stamina weekly

3. Pair it - Combine with your morning shower or coffee routine



A 2022 behavioral study at Stanford (Dr. BJ Fogg) found that people who ""stacked"" new habits to existing routines had 83% better adherence.



Beyond Physical Benefits



The University of Vermont's 2020 mental health study showed 7-minute exercisers reported:



•31% less stress

•22% better sleep quality

•19% increased productivity



Venture capitalist Naval Ravikant credits his 7-minute routine for ""clearing mental fog before big decisions.""



Getting Started Today



1. Download a free 7-minute workout app

2. Keep workout clothes by your bed

3. Involve colleagues/family for accountability



Remember: Consistency beats duration. Seven minutes daily creates more impact than sporadic hour-long sessions. Your health investment pays compound interest - start your timer now!



Pro Tip: For amplified results, pair with 7 minutes of meditation post-workout. The University of Sydney's 2023 wellness study found this combination doubled cognitive benefits.



Your busiest days need this powerful pause most. Whether you're a parent, executive, or student - you've got 7 minutes to transform your life. Start now, feel the difference today, and thank yourself a year from now!",1,1753379492.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

I got fed up with it.,"Me (27m) and my Ex (23f) were in a relationship for a year. At the start things were great but gradually over time she kept flirting with other men, I found on her phone that 1 month into the realtionship she had messaged an old fuckbudy looking to meet up with him. I saw her kiss somebody else in front of me. I wasn't perfect either, but I certainly never cheated and tried to treat her like a princess.

We broke up a month ago. After I finally snapped with all her cheating, we had a big fight one night and she blocked me on everything 10 minutes later after I left her house at 5am. A few week go on and she asks over text ""Are you alright?""

I respond with ""There's not really a lot to talk about over text tbh, but if you ever wanna grab coffee sometime let me know.""

Her: ""Forget I asked then""

This was such a strange exchange for me. Then I find out that she went on a night out to a bar that we frequent a lot. She bumped into my friends there and told them ""Do yous hate me? How is he? awk I still love him to bits, I love him to bits, but he's ignoring me!""

Then I find out that she went out again to that same bar, and told some of my other friends that we had broken up. Now... When I finally went to that bar, I was dragged out of it by those friends and they asked me ""What happened? We heard that you both broke up... Did you cheat??""

I had three different friends ask me if I cheated after speaking with her. So I got fed up, I messaged my Ex's Best Friend. And said ""Can you tell your friend to leave my friends alone, they don't want to talk to her on nights out. I now have people asking me if I'M the one that cheated, after everything that she's done to me. Please leave me and my friends alone. I still have the DM's that show I wasn't the one that cheated""

Well 5 mins after I sent that message, My ex tries to call me (I don't pick up) she texts me and it read ""How many times do I have to tell you to leave my fucking friends alone. You're such a coward, you're 27 years old, act like it. They way your're acting right now is out of control and borderline dilusional! Forget about the past and move on for both our sakes. I'll leave this on a good note, take care of yourself.""

1m8b7fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1m8b7fn/does_amazon_basics_10cup_water_filter_pitcher/,Does Amazon Basics 10-Cup Water Filter Pitcher Deliver Pure Water? Full Review,"**Tested Performance and Reliability of the Amazon Basics 1038354 Water Pitcher**  

The Amazon Basics 1038354 Water Pitcher, specially designed with a Brita-compatible filtration system, recently became a part of my daily kitchen routine. I’ve always been meticulous about water quality, and having a filtration system that is both efficient and easy to use is non-negotiable for me. While putting it to the test in my busy household, I found a mix of impressive features, along with a few quirks worth mentioning.  

**Convenient and Space-Efficient Design**  

The construction of this water pitcher is among its notable strengths. Its compact frame fits snugly into our fridge shelves, even with other items vying for space. Despite its smaller footprint, the pitcher boasts a 10-cup capacity, translating to around three 24-ounce fills—ideal for keeping the family hydrated without constant refills. What impressed me most was its sleek aesthetic and the secure lid technology that completely eliminated what I dreaded—messy leaks. Its ergonomic handle felt natural to grip, even when the pitcher was full.  

[Don’t miss Amazon Basics 1038354 deals—check Amazon here.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07yt18p21/)  

**Efficient Filtration and WQA Certification**  

I tested the filtration system extensively, and it clearly delivered. The pitcher effectively tackles chlorine taste, copper, mercury, and other common contaminants, thanks to its multi-stage filtration system. Certified by the Water Quality Association (WQA), the filtering performance meets NSF/ANSI Standards 42, 53, and 372. With every pour, you notice the flavor difference—cleaner, fresher water that makes tea, coffee, and even cooking taste better. I also appreciated that the pitcher’s material is lead-free and BPA-free, leaving no doubt about its safety for my family.  

**Maintenance with the MEMO Feature**  

The pitcher includes a small but practical electronic MEMO feature to notify users when the filter needs replacing—a handy addition, given that I’m notorious for forgetting such updates. Each filter lasts for about two months or 40 gallons of use. With a family constantly filling up reusable bottles, these reminders came in clutch to ensure optimal filtration.  

**Strengths**  

- Exceptional filtration, improving water taste and removing contaminants.  
- Space-saving design that fits perfectly in fridge compartments.  
- Secure lid technology preventing leaks during use or storage.  
- Lead-free, BPA-free construction promotes safety and peace of mind.  

**Weaknesses**  

- The electronic MEMO can be tricky to reset; it took me a couple of tries the first time around.  
- Filters are a bit on the pricey side, and the pitcher doesn’t come with extras in the box.  

**Comparing to Competing Options**  

When put side-by-side with similar filtration pitchers like the Brita Everyday Pitcher or the ZeroWater 10-cup model, the Amazon Basics alternative offers a competitive mix. While Brita may lead in brand recognition and ZeroWater’s five-stage filtration is a strong selling point, this pitcher strikes a balance with its affordability and compatibility with Brita filters—something ZeroWater lacks. On the other hand, the build quality feels slightly less robust than Brita’s premium options. Still, for its price range, it delivers dependable results and a convenient size that rivals pricier alternatives.  

**True Value for Everyday Use**  

The affordability of this water pitcher, combined with its efficiency and thoughtful design, makes it a smart spending choice for most homes. If you’re looking for filtered water without diving into overly expensive pitcher systems, it's hard to argue against this option. The Brita-compatible filters add another layer of cost-effectiveness since they're widely available and often on sale, making replacements less of a hassle. While it might not have the premium build or extended filtration of higher-priced competitors, it hits the sweet spot for great everyday value.

Our department hit a huge milestone last quarter, and our manager surprised us with personalized gifts, nothing extravagant, just thoughtful little bundles with our names embroidered on laptop sleeves. I loved mine because it had a quote I always say stitched on it.

Anyway, I took the gift home and used it daily. Last week, I noticed it was missing from my desk after I came back from lunch. I looked everywhere. Thought maybe I left it in the bathroom or breakroom. Nope.

Cut to yesterday: I’m at a team meeting and see my coworker “Tina” waltz in late… holding MY sleeve. Like, literally mine. My name wasn’t on the outside, but I opened the flap and sure enough, there’s the custom quote: “Coffee. Deadline. Chaos.”

I calmly said, “Oh wow! That looks exactly like the one I lost!” and she said, “Oh! I just found this one in my car. Must’ve been there for weeks.”

Ma’am. The gifts were given last week. I told her politely, “That's literally mine. You must've picked it up by mistake.” She goes, “No? I mean, they gave me one too. Maybe we just got the same one.”

I asked to see the inside. She refused and said I was being dramatic. My manager had to get involved. Long story short, she “reluctantly” gave it back and claimed she didn’t want it anymore anyway.

I don’t know what she thought would happen when people saw it. She’s now walking around telling people I “accused her of stealing over a sleeve.” Okay, but you DID.",212,1753379335.0,EntitledPeople,27,0.97,False

1m8b5vx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1m8b5vx/cheap_itsecurity_and_the_true_costs_surrounding/,Cheap IT/Security and the true costs surrounding it. Opinion / Discussion,"Reading this Ars Technica article about the Clorox breach struck a nerve.

https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/how-do-hackers-get-passwords-sometimes-they-just-ask/

A cybercriminal called the outsourced helpdesk, asked for a password reset and MFA bypass—and got it. No verification. No resistance. Just handed the keys to the kingdom. Clorox now estimates $380 million in damage.

I’m working on a paper for potential submission to Black Hat, and this breach is a textbook example of the thesis: breaches are increasingly driven by the degradation of IT and InfoSec quality—because these disciplines have been financially reframed as cost centers rather than strategic imperatives.

Clorox outsourced helpdesk and security to the lowest bidder. They got what they paid for. And when the breach hit, they tapped cyber insurance—fueling a cycle that’s hurting the entire industry.

Here’s the fallout:

Cyber insurers reassess risk profiles

Premiums rise, coverage shrinks

Startups struggle to get insured

Companies respond by hiring cheaper IT

The cycle repeats

It’s a self-sustaining problem. And it’s time we called it what it is: economic negligence masquerading as operational efficiency.

I would argue to take IT and Security out of the control or at least direct report of the financial silos in orgs. Re-integrate security with IT but maintain its autonomy.

Reframe these cyber only cults / cliques that pop up in orgs because it is a great buzzword to say yeah, we have our own SOC. And start building integrated teams again where everyone including your server admins speak the language. 

Make it a cultural shift. don't reduce control. You will always have specialists within a team, and someone has to have autonomy to make even the technical leaders toe the line but don't hide them in their own little cube farm. Simple daily osmosis around a cup of coffee will raise even the worst admin's IQ a little. And taking IT/Security from a line-item cost back to its own business center would save a lot of companies a lot of problems. IF they hire quality people again and invest in their bottom-line aka the tech that makes that bottom line possible.

I would like opinions am I off base in my thinking? Thoughts about what we can do to steer the industry back a bit?

#### **💸 Financial Ruin & Tax Penalty**

The central crisis of the stream is Daniel's dire financial situation, which he brings up repeatedly.

* 💥 **(3:26)** Daniel reveals he has received ""very bad news"" from the tax authorities. He has been given a penalty for unpaid taxes and has only **three weeks to pay £6,100**.
* 🤝 **(3:55)** To cover this, he is negotiating with his mother to borrow more money. If she agrees, he will owe his mother a staggering **£10,000 in total**.
* 😫 **(4:09)** He admits this debt will cripple him, explaining that even if he pays her back £1,000 a month upon returning to the UK, it will take 10 months to clear the debt, preventing him from saving for any future trips.
* 🪙 **(25:17)** He details his stock portfolio, which he is reluctant to sell. He has £5,000 in gold, £2,000 in China stocks, and smaller amounts in Tesla and an inverse fund. He fears selling his gold as he believes ""WW3 is coming"" and it will ""go to the moon.""
* 🧑‍💼 **(32:14)** He laments that he might have to get a real job to pay off the debt, but despises the idea as it would mean losing his ""no job streak.""
* 💷 **(1:55:25)** The debt to his mother is confirmed to be £9,000, as she has offered to lend him an additional £4,000.

---

#### **🤬 Damaging Drama with ""Friends"" & Collaborators**

Daniel's relationships with his collaborators, particularly Blood bucket and Sunny, are shown to be fraught with tension and resentment.

* 🧵 **(12:51)** A viewer brings up a damaging tweet from his collaborator, Blood bucket. Daniel confirms she made a tweet calling him an ""isoro,"" which he translates as ""freeloader."" He tries to downplay it, saying he finds it ""funny.""
* 🧛 **(18:09)** In a moment of startling honesty, Daniel embraces the ""freeloader"" label. He states, **""If someone lets me leech then I will leech. Why not? I'm not ashamed of it. I will suck where I can suck.""** This confirms the sentiment behind Blood bucket's tweet.
* 💬 **(20:20)** The chat turns viciously on Blood bucket, with users calling her a ""two-faced old hag"" and a ""waste of space in Japanese Society."" Daniel weakly tells them to stop.
* 🎤 **(7:06)** He is confronted about using another collaborator, Sunny, for content and being ""cheap and pathetic."" He defends himself by stating he paid for karaoke and yakiniku, but reveals that Sunny still owes him for her half of the meal.
* 💔 **(4:34:41)** He recounts a deeply unflattering story about a Korean woman he dated in Japan last year. After she fell off a bicycle and broke her arm, he admits he **""ditched her"" and ""ran straight back to Thailand""** to save his relationship with his current girlfriend, leaving the injured woman behind. He proceeds to insult her, calling her mannerisms ""manly"" and ""butch.""

---

#### **😳 Explicit & Disturbing Confessions**

Daniel shares several stories and thoughts of a highly personal and often crude nature.

* 🍆 **(26:35)** He recounts a past sexual encounter with a gay Japanese man. He explicitly details the oral sex, referring to it as the ""Boris Johnson"" and describing the technique. He justifies it by saying, **""2016 was tough didn't get any girls, not even one.""**
* 💸 **(4:03:39)** He confesses to having a ""wild"" OnlyFans phase in Manchester where he made **£1,500 a month**. He describes using a vibrating, thrusting dildo with a cock ring and a male torso sex toy that he attached to a window.
* 🧼 **(1:01:35)** He disgustedly describes a shared bar of soap in his guesthouse shower that has **""tiny black hairs stuck to it,""** speculating that the user was ""rubbing it in his ass crack or something so hard that it pulls the hairs out.""
* 🍑 **(2:13:43)** While watching two men on a bicycle, he goes on a bizarre and explicit tangent about anal sex, wondering aloud, **""Why does the Willie perfectly go up the bum though even though it's not designed for it... it just perfectly fits up there.""**
* 🛏️ **(1:03:08)** He openly admits to stealing consumable items from hotels, including shampoo, coffee, tissues, and even pajamas from a capsule hotel.

---

#### **😢 Personal Misfortunes & Deep Sadness**

Beneath the crude humour and drama, Daniel reveals moments of profound loneliness and regret.

* 😭 **(55:30)** In a moment of vulnerability, he recalls deliberately moving to the same street as an ex-girlfriend. The experience was crushing, and he admits, **""I actually cried in the park cuz I felt like oh my God I fucked everything up so much.""**
* 🪦 **(1:36:48)** He speaks about his deceased father with deep regret and sadness. He feels his father, a ""good guy who worked hard,"" deserved a better son. He is glad his father wasn't alive to witness his ""OnlyFans stuff"" and see him **""showing his bum hole,""** especially when compared to his successful, academic cousins.
* 🧠 **(3:48:40)** He admits that his intense eye contact during sex is a manipulative tactic to make women fall in love with him, releasing ""endorphins and serotonin, oxytocin"" so they ""get like stalker crazy"" over him.
* 🧍 **(3:38:41)** He reveals a period in his life where he was so desperate to be attractive that he tried to look like a girl he would be attracted to, growing his hair long and wearing baggy clothes.

### **🕓 General Timeline**

**(0:00 - 10:00)**
🧪 Daniel begins the stream testing a new app to prevent his phone from overheating. He is on a 15km walk back to his guesthouse from a ""top secret"" business meeting in Osaka. He quickly drops the major bombshell: the tax authorities have given him a three-week deadline to pay a **£6,100 penalty (3:26)**. He details his negotiations to borrow more money from his mother, which would bring his total debt to her to £10,000. He deflects drama about his collaborator Sunny, claiming he paid for things, and acknowledges that another streamer (""meaningless"") is making videos attacking him.

**(10:00 - 30:00)**
🌸 The walk continues along a scenic river with cherry blossoms. The stream's focus shifts to drama with his other collaborator, Blood bucket, who apparently tweeted that he was a freeloader **(12:51)**. Daniel confirms the tweet but downplays its severity, though his chat begins to viciously attack Blood bucket. He openly admits to being a ""leech"" if given the opportunity **(18:09)**. He then revisits his financial stress, listing his stock portfolio and worrying about a potential World War III affecting his gold prices **(25:17)**. This leads to a bizarre and explicit confession about a past oral sex encounter with a gay Japanese man **(26:35)**.

**(30:00 - 1:00:00)**
🤖 Daniel contemplates getting a job to pay off his debt but hates the idea of losing his ""no job streak"" **(32:14)**. He simulates what a real date with him would be like, consisting of long, awkward silences **(34:02)**. As he walks through a dark, sketchy area, he transitions to talking about his current guesthouse. He shares a deeply personal and sad story about crying in a park over a past relationship after he stalked his ex's neighborhood **(55:30)**. He mentions a past encounter with the police but refuses to elaborate **(57:36)**.

**(1:00:00 - 2:00:00)**
🧽 The misery continues with a disgusting story about finding a hairy bar of soap in the shared shower **(1:01:35)** and his habit of stealing consumables from hotels **(1:03:08)**. He fondly and sadly reminisces about his deceased father, expressing shame over his OnlyFans career and how it would have embarrassed him **(1:36:48)**. He recounts his past as a ""fare dodger"" on UK trains **(2:05:25)** and makes a series of increasingly crude comments about anal sex. He finally arrives back in the Umeda area, having walked in a massive, inefficient circle.

**(2:00:00 - 3:00:00)**
🍔 Tired and hungry, Daniel decides to walk the remaining distance home. He gets angry at a user who makes a joke about mugging him and bans them from the chat **(3:24:24)**. He rants about his ""incel"" audience, blaming it on a video he once made about Elliot Rodger. He eventually finds a McDonald's, orders a burger, and eats it while complaining about the annoying music **(2:32:16)**. He then continues his long walk home.

**(3:00:00 - 4:00:00)**
🚴‍♂️ The final leg of the journey is filled with more complaining. He rants about the poor design of Japanese city planning, his ex-girlfriend's love for crab, and his mom's dating choices. He is angered by a cyclist on the pavement who gets too close to him **(4:08:09)**. He reveals his ""wild"" OnlyFans past in Manchester, detailing the toys he used and the money he made **(4:03:39)**.

**(4:00:00 - 5:00:00)**
🧠 Daniel tells the story of ditching an injured Korean woman in Japan to save his current relationship **(4:34:41)** and provides a pseudo-psychological breakdown of women from different Asian countries. He finally arrives in his home area of Amagasaki, complaining about the noisy traffic.

**(5:00:00 - 6:00:00)**
🌃 He sits in a park outside his guesthouse, reflecting on his failures and disappointments. He complains about his acne, his aging appearance, and the audience he has attracted. He expresses regret for making videos on racial topics and about Elliot Rodger, which he believes brought him the wrong kind of attention **(5:46:52)**. He discusses his failures in dating and how he met his current girlfriend purely by chance.

**(6:00:00 - 7:24:49)**
📱 The stream concludes in his small, noisy guesthouse room. He enjoys a can of ginger ale, which he describes in minute detail. He complains about his loud American housemate and the constant noise. His phone finally overheats, forcing him to use his other phone to read chat. He discusses his financial plan to pay off his debt to his mother and complains about his boredom and lack of purpose before ending the nearly 7.5-hour stream.

1m8awjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1m8awjo/delve_into_the_best_microwave_oven_with_the/,Delve Into the Best Microwave Oven with the Cuisinart CMW-100,"Cuisinart CMW-100 caught my attention mainly because of its stainless steel design and reputation for reliability. I’ve spent quite some time with this microwave, testing everything from reheating leftovers to experimenting with more precise cooking like defrosting chicken. This isn’t just another microwave—it positions itself as a premium, functional appliance, and it does a lot right, although not without a couple of quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The brushed chrome exterior and stainless steel interior give this microwave a polished, modern feel. It blends seamlessly into my kitchen, matching my other stainless steel appliances perfectly. I appreciate the choice of materials here; not only do they look premium, but the stainless steel interior is effortless to clean and never retains food odors. The touchpad controls feel relatively responsive, and the LCD screen, though not the brightest, gets the job done well enough for day-to-day use. What I was less impressed by was its slightly bulky size considering it’s only a 1-cubic-foot capacity microwave, but if you have the counter space, this unit looks great.  

**Cooking Performance**  
This microwave’s performance exceeds what most generic options offer. Its 1000 watts of power ensure that food gets heated quickly and evenly in the rotating glass turntable. The 25 preprogrammed settings felt like a significant time-saver, especially when I needed shortcuts for defrosting or reheating coffee. Using the two-stage cooking function was another feature I tested—it makes switching from defrost to cooking seamless, which came in handy when making healthier meals without oil. On the downside, these features take a bit of trial and error to fully understand, as instructions could be a little more in-depth for a first-time user.  

**Ease of Use**  
Navigating the touchpad controls was a relatively smooth experience, although not flawless. The preset buttons are generally accurate and save time when preparing simple foods. For instance, the popcorn setting nailed it every time—no burnt bits or unpopped kernels. However, the lack of a backlit touchpad made it challenging to adjust settings when cooking during dimmer parts of the day. Additionally, while the defrost functions worked well for most situations, I noticed they can sometimes leave unevenly thawed spots for larger items like frozen cuts of meat.  

**Good Aspects**  
- The stainless steel interior is hygienic, odor-resistant, and easy to clean.  
- Preprogrammed settings add convenience for frequent tasks like reheating drinks or defrosting.  
- Two-stage cooking operation automates meal prep effectively.  

[Check Cuisinart CMW-100 price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b000iw9j20/)  

**Shortcomings**  
- Slightly bulky for the advertised capacity of 1 cubic foot.  
- Touchpad lacks a backlight, which affects usability in low light.  
- Some presets and settings require experimentation to use efficiently.  

**Competing Products**  
While testing the CMW-100, I found myself comparing it to similar models like the Panasonic NN-SN686S and the Toshiba EM131A5C-BS. Both competitors offer similar features, such as preprogrammed settings and stainless steel interiors. Panasonic stood out for its inverter technology, which helps cook food evenly without constant pausing. Toshiba, on the other hand, excels in user-friendliness with its bright digital display and an interior light that stays on while cooking. The Cuisinart microwave competes well with its two-stage cooking and defrost functions, but it falls slightly behind Panasonic in terms of even heating for large dishes. However, the Cuisinart’s premium-looking brushed chrome design gives it a style advantage over both competitors.  

**Quality for Price**  
For its feature set, this microwave feels reasonably priced and provides good value for the investment. Its stainless steel interior alone made cleaning stress-free compared to cheaper plastic alternatives. While some settings felt tricky to master initially, this microwave feels like a reliable long-term option. If you’re balancing performance with aesthetics and functionality, it’s a worthwhile contender, albeit with minor compromises.

Outside one station is an old man who begs with a mostly empty coffee cup, repeatedly crying out “help me”, completely ignored by everyone, including station staff. At the other station is a very old woman who also seems very desperate, has a trolley loaded with stuff asking for change. She doesn’t seem to speak English, so we don’t get anywhere when I ask if she has a place to stay or any family.

I’ve been told many times online and irl that there is plenty of help for people who genuinely want to find it, but I just feel like these people must need some pointers or support of some kind. What am I missing? I’ve handed them change a few times but I don’t feel like it helps.

The first thing I noticed was Nath’s face.
Not her voice. Not her footsteps. Her face.

Pale. Drawn. Eyes sharp with something I didn’t recognize right away not fear. Not confusion. Rage.

She didn’t even knock. Just pushed through the curtain, clutching her old tablet like it was the last truth left in the world.

“It’s gone,” she said. No hello. No softness. Just… those words.

I didn’t move.

“What’s gone?”

She looked at me like she wanted to scream and cry at the same time. “The trupe. The one we built in the eastern dumps. The one with the food line. The water filters. The school tents.”

Gone.

My mouth dried. My fingers clenched the cup in my hand. It cracked. I didn’t notice.

“How?” I asked, though I already knew.

She stepped forward, shoved the tablet onto the table. The images were blurry. Drones, maybe. Or some neighbor with shaky hands and a death wish.

Blood. Smoke. Torn bodies on plastic chairs. Kids with mud and ash on their cheeks. A woman holding her own arm like it belonged to someone else.

“They’re calling it a gang war,” Nath said, voice low and venomous. “Local infighting. No mention of zumbis. No mention of trained units. Just… poor people killing each other. Same story they always use when they want silence.”

I stood up slowly. My legs weren’t shaking. Not this time.

“Who?”

She didn’t hesitate. “It was them. Association forces. Maybe the Lótus. Maybe worse. You know it. I know it. They cleaned it up fast. No survivors. No press. Just whispers and blame.”

I turned to the window. The same city looked back. Same towers. Same gleaming lie of justice. But something inside me cracked — and this time, I wasn’t going to glue it back together.

“Where’s Gaspar?”

“Outside. Helping organize kits for the west camp.”

“Call him. And Honny too.”
Nath nodded and disappeared.

I breathed in through my nose. Slow. Deep. Controlled. The way my father used to when he was about to do something stupid. Or something brave.

They killed them.

They slaughtered people I fed. People who laughed. People who built houses with scraps and painted murals with charcoal and broken dreams.

Not soldiers. Not rebels.

People.

They called them trash. Again. And made sure no one would care.

I heard the curtain shift. Gaspar entered first, jaw clenched, shirt stained with oil and ash. Honny followed, cracking his knuckles like he already knew.

“They hit us,” I said.

Neither of them asked who.

“They hit us where they thought no one would notice. Where the cameras don’t go. Where lives don’t count.”

I turned around.

“But now we hit back.”

Gaspar raised an eyebrow. “Another bank?”

I shook my head. “No. That’s not enough. That’s for food. For supplies. This time… we’re not feeding anyone. We’re sending a message.”

Honny stepped closer. “What kind of message?”

“The kind that bleeds.” I walked to the map on the wall. The one we used for deliveries. Routes. Safe zones.

I jabbed a finger at the city center. “Here. Around them. Where they eat. Where they sleep. Where they invest. Places that fund the Association. Businesses, buildings, restaurants, banks. They think they’re untouchable.”

I turned to them. “Let’s prove them wrong.”
Nath reappeared, eyes wide. “You’re going to hit the rich?”

I nodded. “Not the poor waiters. Not the janitors. The structures. The symbols. The polished lies they built to pretend they’re better than us.”

She walked forward. “Then I’m in.”
I hesitated. “Nath…”

She lifted her arm, pulled up her sleeve. A half-healed bite mark scar ran across her forearm — the price of her power.

“I heal with pain,” she said. “And I’m willing to bleed for them. But now I’ll bleed for us.”

I smiled. It wasn’t a nice smile.

“You’re coming,” I said. “We’ll need you. Every wound we take… you’ll make sure we keep standing. You’re not just support. You’re the difference between vengeance and suicide.”

She nodded. Her eyes didn’t blink once.

“Gaspar,” I said, turning. “Honny. Spread the word. Quietly. I want volunteers. Fighters. Thinkers. People who’ve lost something. People who are ready to lose more.”

“On it,” Gaspar said.

“And one more thing,” I added. “Bring me a list. Politicians. Names. The ones voting in favor of the Association’s expansion. The ones who pretend to help the poor while kissing Almair’s boots in secret. I want to know what time they sleep and what they’re afraid of.”

Honny grinned. “Got a few names already. But I’ll dig deeper.”

“Good.” I turned back to the window. “They took our homes. Our peace. Our brothers.”

I touched the glass. The city lights flickered like lies waiting to burn.

“Now we take something back.”

———

**Zenos**

The scanner beeped again.

Another can. Another bag of rice. Another sack of dry food no one would enjoy eating but everyone would be glad to have.

I stood in line, hoodie up, head low. The fluorescent lights hummed above like they had nothing to answer for. The woman at the register barely looked at me.

“You want a receipt?”

I mumbled something. Didn’t matter. My eyes were on the TV above the counter — muted, but not silent.

Footage.
Grainy, aerial.

Shacks torn apart. Smoke. Panic. Broken limbs under tarps.

The Eastern Zone.

I felt my stomach pull tight. My jaw clenched. I turned up the volume.

“—still investigating the cause of the violent conflict between rival factions in the Eastern Dumps. Officials claim internal disputes led to at least 30 confirmed deaths—”

Lies.

Rotten, scripted, polished lies.

They wiped out a community and blamed the victims for bleeding.

I didn’t blink.
I didn’t breathe.
I just kept watching.
The scanner beeped again.
Then the broadcast changed.

A new anchor. A different background. Police lights.

“—and in other news, the Association confirmed today that one of its elite agents, Joseph Galverin, successfully ended the life of the fugitive responsible for the murder of young student Beatriz F. and her family.”

No.

My heart dropped. A photo of Bea flashed on the screen — the school one, the one with her smiling in that stiff, polite way only good kids smile.

Joseph stood in front of a house. Calm. Poised.

“We arrived too late to save the family,” he said. “But we made sure the criminal paid for what he did. No more victims. No more danger.”

No more truth.

I didn’t finish the groceries.
Didn’t say a word.
I just left.

Teleported straight into the bunker.

Samuel was standing near the training room, shadow-clones scattered like old coats on chairs. Zula was mid-sentence about something — food, logistics, a snide remark, I don’t know.

I grabbed Samuel by the arm.

Zula raised her voice. “Zenos, what the hell—”
But we were already gone.

—

The house was empty.

I blinked into Trent’s apartment like a ghost through glass — no time for knocking, no permission asked. The lights were off. No voices. No smell of burnt coffee or dirty laundry. Just silence.

“Fuck,” I whispered.

Samuel stretched his neck like he was waking up from a nap.

“So… action time?” he asked, cracking his knuckles.

I didn’t answer.
I grabbed his shoulder again.
Gone.

—

Next house.

Tasha’s.
Empty again.

This time, I didn’t knock either. I didn’t even pretend. I kicked the door open and stormed through the kitchen, the hallway, the room with the tangled bedsheets and lightning scars on the ceiling.

No one.
But a window slid open behind me.

An old woman from the next house peered through the bars. Scared, but not stupid.

“Are you… looking for the girl?”

I stepped closer, heart racing.

“Yes. Tasha. Where is she?”

The woman looked around, lowered her voice.

“She left earlier today. But she said… if anyone came asking, to tell them she was at her aunt’s place.”

My chest tightened. “Where?”

“I… I don’t—”

“WHERE?!”

The woman flinched. “The woman said two men already came! Scary ones. Tall. One had gloves. They asked for her too!”

I felt something tear in my chest.

The woman swallowed hard and gave me the address.

Before she finished the last syllable—

We were gone.

———

**James**

I was losing my patience.

These little fuckers kept blinking at me like scared rodents, and somehow none of them knew anything.

Not where Leo was.
Not what Zenos was planning.
Not even why they were being hunted.

I stared at the girl — Tasha. Static buzzing at her fingertips, voice shaking, posture cracking.

She should be begging by now. They all should.

“Why,” I muttered, pacing again. “Why the fuck are you all still pretending? Do you not understand what’s happening?”

She stayed silent. Chest rising fast. Mel sat behind her, lips tight like she was holding back every insult she’d ever known.

Luke’s voice cut through the air like a scalpel.
Cold.
Precise.

“If she doesn’t know… then kill her.”

He said it the way someone orders coffee.
Simple.
Expected.

Mel laughed. A dry, strained sound. “We were having tea. Remember? Tea?”

And that was when Tasha moved.

Fast.

She bolted from the table like her bones were firecrackers, like the floor itself had betrayed her.

I stepped forward.

Five seconds.

Back.

She froze near the hallway, breath hitched.

I saw it — the panic twisting her face, her power creeping up her arms like snakes of light.

Then—

She screamed.

Electricity burst from her fingers, a jagged bolt arcing into my ribs.

It hurt.

Sharp and dirty, like being stabbed with a lightning rod dipped in acid.

I blinked—

Five seconds.

Back.

The hit never landed. But I remembered it. My chest ached from a wound that never happened.

“You think you can win?” I said, stepping toward her again. “You think this matters?”

Tasha trembled, eyes wide, voice breaking.

“NOOOOOOOOOO!”

Her arms flew upward.
And then the world split.


The windows exploded inward.
A sound like thunder being ripped open.
From the streets — a current.

Not hers.
Not from her body.

From the outside.

She had pulled it from the high-voltage lines.

The cables snapped. The energy screamed into the house. The walls lit up in blue-white fire.

And then—

The explosion hit. The explosion was so fast I couldn't activate my power

A burst of light. A shockwave. A scream swallowed by dust and flame.

The roof lifted.
The ground shattered.
Everything flew.

Me. Luke. The girl. The old woman. Everything.

—

I woke in the rubble.

Blood in my mouth. Ash in my throat. Ears ringing.

My legs felt heavy. My coat was torn open. My hand was trembling.

And standing in front of me, through the smoke—

Zenos.

Calm. Whole. Still alive.
No rage in his face.
Just silence.

I blinked.

No.

No, not now. Not him.

I realized that the bastard was going to teleport to get the girl. 

Five seconds.
Back.

After I edited the board, I tried again but.
But Zenos was already moving.

I reached—

Nothing.
I tried again—
Nothing.

The power wasn’t activating.

And then…
I felt it.
The cold.

It started at my feet. Climbed to my jaw. A pressure in my skull. Not physical — worse.

Like someone else’s thoughts were pressing through mine.

A voice echoed in my head.
Not mine.
Not Luke’s.

A voice too calm. Too close.

“Look at me, son of Lucifer.”

I turned.

And he was there.

Samuel.

Half-shadow, half-smirk, eyes glowing with satisfaction.

He wasn’t standing.
He was rooted in the dark.
And his shadows—

They had me.

Coiled around my legs, my arms, my mind.
They had Luke too. Hovering. Caught.

I tried to scream but nothing came out.
I tried to teleport but—
The shadows gripped tighter.

“No…” I thought. “No, no, no, not them, not now, not like this—”

I watched as Zenos calmly walked past me.

He stepped over fire and debris and found Tasha, coughing blood, arm dislocated.

Mel was next to her, barely breathing.
Zenos touched them both.

And then—

Gone.

Just like that.
He took them.
Right from under me.

———

**Samuel**

I watched as Zenos vanished into the fold, taking the girl and her aunt with him.

Smoke still danced in the ruins, like ghosts unsure if they should leave. Bits of furniture flamed quietly beside cracked tiles. The house wasn’t a house anymore — just bones. Hollow. Burnt.

And still, James stood.

Alive.
Breathing.
Bleeding.
A reminder.

I stepped forward, slow. My pulse steady, but the heat rising behind my eyes.

“Now…” I whispered, grinning, “it’s my turn to dismember these golden little shits.”

Two shadows peeled from beneath my feet. Clones  lean, tall, cruel. They stretched their arms like waking beasts. One tilted its head at James. The other hissed at Luke.

“You know,” I thought, “they always act like heroes until it’s their blood on the ground.”

I walked, lazy, like a man late to a funeral he didn’t want to miss.

Luke didn’t flinch. He just stared — cold and calculating.

James looked wired. Like a dog halfway through rabies and pride.

“They’re going to try to run,” I thought. “Or fight. Either way, I win.”

I raised my hand.

But before I could speak—

CRACK.

A blur.
A fucking train hit me.

Something slammed into my ribs so hard I stopped breathing.

I didn’t fall.
I flew.

My body bent sideways through the air like I was made of paper and sarcasm. My back hit the pavement with a slap. Bones screamed. Dust flew.

Then—
Wood.

I crashed through the fence of the neighbor’s house, planks exploding around me like shrapnel. My body rolled. Screamed. Bounced once and stopped.

I lay there for two seconds.

Staring up at the sky.
Clouds drifting.
Back on Earth.
And angry.

My ribs were screaming. My right side burned. My mouth filled with blood.

I laughed.

“Oh, you bastards.”

I sat up, spitting red into the grass. “Now there’s three of you? Lovely.”

I pulled myself up, cracked my neck.

“I swear to every god you don’t believe in — I’m going to strangle each of you and hang your fucking corpses off the bridge downtown.”

Something rumbled nearby.

I looked up.
The big one.
The quiet one.
Mako.

Charging at me like a freight train wrapped in muscle and murder.

I smiled.

And vanished.
Right into the shadow.
He swung — nothing there.
They looked around.

Searching.

Panicked, but hiding it.

“I can’t take all three at once,” I thought. “But if I kill one? Worth it.”

My hand slipped through the cracks of the shadow like silk through glass — and grabbed.

Mako’s ankle.
I yanked.
Hard.

He flipped mid-run, slammed face-first into the pavement. My shadow yanked him again — dragging him like roadkill down the asphalt, each bounce scraping skin, snapping rocks, ripping muscle.

THWACK.
CRACK.
THWACK.

Then I hurled him sideways.
He hit a concrete wall.
Left a crater.
Dust rose.

I stepped out of the shadow slowly, my body still aching from the fence — but grinning through it.

James and Luke hadn’t followed.

That was… strange.
“What are you two planning…?”
I turned back to Mako.
He was moving.
Wrong.

His arm — dislocated, torn — was reforming. Bones stitching back. Flesh crawling over itself. Muscles realigning like worms dancing in reverse.

I watched, eyes narrowing.
“Healing.”

“Regeneration and strength. That’s your trick.”
I licked my teeth, smiling wide.

“Perfect,” I said aloud. “Means you can suffer longer.”
I cracked my knuckles.

“Let’s dance, pretty boy.”

———

Mako stumbled forward, still re-forming.

His body dripped blood like a faucet that didn’t know how to close. Parts of him were fresh — too fresh. Raw meat knitted over raw bone. One eye was still rebuilding.

I walked toward him.
My two shadow clones darted ahead.

One kicked him in the gut — the wet sound of pain cracked through the air.

The other slammed an elbow into the side of his face. His jaw twisted unnaturally, but it was already resetting before his head hit the ground.

He wouldn’t stop.
But that didn’t mean I couldn’t break him.

I dropped into his shadow and burst out again right in front of him knees first. I smashed into his chest, sending him flying again. Before he hit the wall, I was gone.

Reappeared behind him.
Fist to the spine.

CRACK.

He roared. A sound between a man and a beast choking on gravel.

I didn’t care.

I kicked the back of his knee. He dropped. Elbowed him across the face — one, two, three, blood flying. He tried to grab me.

I disappeared again.

Clones followed like wolves.

He punched one — it turned to smoke. The other slashed him across the chest with a blade of shadow so sharp it didn’t bleed for two seconds.

Then the blood came in a wave.

He staggered.
Healing.
Still healing.
But slower now.
Too much. Too fast. Too deep.
His legs buckled.
He fell to one knee.
Breathing like fire.
Eyes red.

I stepped out of the darkness behind him.

Calm.
Steady.
Alive.

Mako reached up, trembling, trying to grab me again.

But his arm wouldn’t move.

I had him now — locked in place by the shadows around his ribs, his spine, his throat.

I crouched beside him, whispering like a bedtime story.

“You’re strong. I like that. Really, I do.”

He bled from the eyes now. The kind of bleed you don’t fix.

“But I left your nerves untouched. Just in case.”

I held up my dagger.
Small. Plain. But I loved it.

“You ever tried killing a pig and missed the heart? They scream. A lot. Wiggle too.”

I placed the blade against his chest.

“So I’m gonna keep you still. Nice and still.”

I pulled the dagger back—
And felt a hand on my shoulder.

Firm. Cold.
And suddenly—
Gone.
The world blinked.
Darkness twisted.

And we were inside the bunker.

Safe.
Clean.
Bright.

“ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE?!”

Zenos’ voice slapped me harder than Mako ever could.

I turned, still gripping the dagger, still high on blood.

He stared at me like I was the fire and the gasoline.

“You were going to kill a Golden Cape in broad daylight?! In the middle of a neighborhood?! What the hell is wrong with you?!”

I rolled my eyes, tossed the dagger on the table.

“They were trying to kill a teenager and her grandma in broad daylight, Zenos.”

I stepped closer, still panting.

“And let me tell you something, they are the heroes, not me. I’m the one that kills them.”

I pointed toward the wall, like it could still show me the flames.

“It would’ve been one less name on the damn kill list if you’d given me two more seconds.”

The room was quiet.

Too quiet.

Everyone was staring.
Zula.
Danny.
Giulia.
Leo.

Judging me.

Like they didn’t already know what this war was going to cost.

I shook my head, breathing through my nose.

Then I laughed once. Bitter.

“Go fuck yourselves.”

I turned away, brushing ash off my shoulder.

“I thought I was summoned to a special unit,” I muttered, “not a daycare of dreamers and peace talks.”

And I walked out.
No regrets.
Not yet.

I've never roasted my own coffee beans before. I'm in the process of buying a house, so my budget is lower than it usually would be. Really, I have about $100 that I can spend on coffee roasting hardware right now without being annoyed at myself. For that price, I can get a lightly used FreshRoast SR-500 or a new Sweet Maria's Popper. At first glance both seem to have similar features. The FreshRoast had a much more expensive list price but is also an older model. Both have basic temperature and fan controls. Of these two, which would you prefer to work with?

1m8aq1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBudgetBrides/comments/1m8aq1l/extremely_disappointed_at_luxury_catering_company/,Extremely disappointed at luxury catering company,"I’m so frustrated and disappointed.

So our venue exclusively works with one catering company, and it’s supposed to be luxury catering for $25k for only 50 people. It’s a black tie wedding at a well known famous art center.

We went for food tasting, and let me tell you, the price does not match the quality. 

Start with silverware, we picked matte gold color, when they showed us, the gold color is super faded with the forks, knives and spoons, it’s half silver and half gold, I told them to please find me some that are not faded, it’s so embarrassing to serve the guests with those.

Then the Espresso Martini, it’s watery, no foam on top, no garnish!! It’s not even made with real espresso!! They made it with regular coffee!! They said didn’t have espresso machine, so we offered ours, but of course they won’t take the offer, but promised to make it with strong cold brew and garnish with espresso beans. My group is espresso martini lovers, so this cocktail is really important for us. 

Then the other cocktails, it’s soooo generic, some are way too sweet, some are just meh. I love cocktails, I love delicious and pretty cocktails, so having average cocktails at my wedding is horrifying! 

The food: Passed hor d'oeuvres was good, I have no complaints! But I had very high hopes for the 3 course plated meal, to say we’re disappointed is underrated! We had short ribs, fish and vegan options, all were dry, and tasteless, the short rib was not flavorful, and it’s chewy! We gave them our feedback, so hopefully they’ll make it better! 

The dining chairs: initially we choose chivalry chairs, but it’s so damn squeaky, and it’s on the verge of falling apart! So we ended paying much more extra for wooden chairs, that’s more sturdy and it looks better too. 

All the other rental furnitures, dining ware and equipments are so ugly! No great options, the  “best ones” we picked on the catalog are just basic, like very basic! We ended hiring another rental company for some of the items and decors! 

This catering company honestly has no business calling themselves anywhere remotely close to being luxury! For $25k for 50 people, I expected the best quality of everything! Am I being unreasonable?

### **🕒 General Timeline**

* 🏃 **(0:00 - 35:00)** Daniel begins his stream in Kyoto, complaining of physical exhaustion and knee pain. He walks towards Nijo Castle, discusses stealing hotel shampoo, and laments being ""ghosted"" by an old friend. He criticizes Japanese food and expresses a preference for McDonald's.
* 🏯 **(35:00 - 56:00)** He arrives at the Nijo Castle entrance but refuses to pay the 1,300 Yen fee. He walks around the outside, complaining that Kyoto is boring. He discusses drama with his exes and other content creators, including a tense moment when ""Elvis the Alien"" joins the chat.
* 🌳 **(56:00 - 1:40:00)** He walks to the Kyoto Imperial Palace grounds. He reveals he has arthritis from chlamydia. He talks about being reported to the police by his ex-wife. The grounds are mostly empty gravel, which he finds disappointing. His phone overheats, and he spits on it to cool it down.
* 🍔 **(1:40:00 - 2:51:00)** Hungry and bored, Daniel leaves the palace grounds and walks for 26 minutes to find a Burger King. He eats his ""Ugly Burger."" Afterwards, he walks to the popular Gion district.
* 🏮 **(2:51:00 - 4:27:00)** He explores the crowded streets of Gion and makes his way to the Yasaka Shrine. He sits and rests, discussing his precarious financial situation and his mother lending him £5,000. He explores the quieter back areas of the shrine.
* 🎥 **(4:27:00 - 5:32:00)** The stream is derailed when his chat discovers a BBC News clip featuring his ex-girlfriend, Miel.

* 🚉 **(5:32:00 - 6:22:00)** He arrives at the massive Kyoto Station. He is informed by his chat that another streamer is making death threats against him. He explores the station's upper levels and rooftop, which he finds more impressive than the tourist sites.
* 🌧️ **(6:22:00 - 7:22:00)** It begins to rain. He makes his way to the train platforms to head back to Osaka. He boards a limited express ""Thunderbird"" train after some confusion and has to buy a supplementary ticket from the conductor.
* 🍷 **(7:22:00 - 8:49:00)** The train journey back to Osaka. He arrives at Umeda Station, goes to a supermarket to buy a pizza, red wine, and chocolate, and then takes a local train to his friend Blood Bucket's neighborhood.
* 🏠 **(8:49:00 - 11:39:27)** Daniel arrives at Blood Bucket's apartment. They make pizza, drink wine, and talk. The conversation covers the Miel video, the death threats, past drama, his exes, his finances, and graphic sexual stories. The stream ends after nearly 12 hours as they hang out.

After 3 years of pushing my 2022 M2 MacBook Air to its absolute limits in film school. I’ve finally upgraded to the 16-inch MacBook Pro with 48GB of unified memory, and honestly… it feels unreal.

I’ve spent the last few years editing, color grading and sound designing entire short films on the MacBook Air. Avid Media Composer and DaVinci Resolve on 8GB RAM weren’t exactly happy with me. I was constantly making proxies, praying timelines wouldn’t lag, and doing everything I could to make things run smooth enough to finish my assignments. It slowed me down a lot, but it never stopped me. That little machine held me down through all-nighters, last-minute renders, and thesis film deadlines.

Now that I’ve moved to the MacBook Pro… everything is seamless. Playback is fluid, node-heavy color grades don’t choke, and renders actually finish before my coffee gets cold. For the first time in a while, I feel like my tools are catching up with my ideas instead of holding them back.

**Mystery Product #1**

1.  Below the midnight canopy, the keeper of cycles turns alpha into clarity—five letters, easily mistaken for the sleep-maker, but holding dominion over awareness as day and night entwine.
2. Not crowned nor rooted, this silent warden threads oxidized armor through ancient stacks—its reputation for protection often confused with roots that grip the Himalayas or warriors of adaptogenic lore.

**Mystery Product #2**

1. Beneath lunar soil, a rare plant forges stamina from the shadows; yet some believe its true gift lies not in fertility, but in the cadence of forgotten rhythms. Distilled through heat, its legacy points east, though mistaken often for ginseng.  
2. Once raw, now transformed, its structure softened, yet elusive phytochemicals may vanish in the process. Some seek the resinous treasure in mountains or the fortifying spike in Himalayan roots, overlooking this gift of the gods.

**Mystery Product #3**

1. Beneath the surface of midnight fruit and ocean-borne fronds, a spectrum of signals convenes. Some see only color or kelp, neglecting the silent orchestration that unlocks the furnace within; igniting embers not with heat, but with the whisper of awakened mitochondria.  
2. They gather from spires, rhizomes, pods, and bark; never crowned but always potent. Their arsenal includes vanilloids and ancient spice, cloaked beneath radiant pepper and fabled ginger, yet their rally is not for flavor: only to stoke invisible fires and redraw the borders between storage and spark.

**Mushroom Magic**

* Introducing Mushroom Magic Powder Blend—our caffeine-free, ready-to-mix blend featuring Lion’s Mane, Cordyceps militaris, Poria, and Tiger Milk Mushroom. Each 1.65g scoop adds a gentle boost to your favorite drink, supporting natural clarity, focus, and balanced mood throughout the day. This blend is perfect for anyone interested in daily mushroom wellness but craving flexibility without coffee or matcha.

**Mushroom Magic Advanced**

* Mushroom Magic Advanced Blend is for those looking to add clarity, energy, and focus to their daily routine without overcomplicating their wellness approach. This unique powder is created with a thoughtful mixture of premium mushroom extracts that dissolve quickly into water or your favorite smoothie. One of the standout features is the careful balancing of each functional ingredient, including organic Poria extract (Wolfiporia extensa) sclerotium, Lion’s Mane 8:1 extract (Hericium erinaceus) fruiting body, Cordyceps militaris 10:1 extract (fruiting body), Tiger Milk Mushroom (Lignosus rhinocerus) sclerotium, and Erinamax™ Liquid Culture Lion’s Mane mycelium. Every serving is easy to mix and has a mild, earthy profile that complements almost any drink.

1m8anbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1m8anbb/naples_in_late_november_suggestions/,"Naples in late November! Suggestions, Recommendations","Salve r/ItalyTravel

My wife and I are so excited for our first trip to Italy. We'll be arriving in Napoli on Tuesday, November 26th (around noon) and leaving on Sunday, December 1st (in the morning). We know this gives us about 4.5 days, and during this time we absolutely want to do day trips to Pompeii and the Amalfi Coast. This leaves us with roughly 2.5 days for Naples itself.

We love history, coffee, walking, and most importantly, experiencing authentic local (on a budget). I've done a bunch of research and put together a ""wishlist"" of things to see and eat. I would be incredibly grateful for your input on what's realistic and what we should prioritize.

We would let most of the items from that list go in favor of options that allow us to immerse ourselves in the local culture (meet people, share meals, learn about life in Napoli)

1. National Archaeological Museum (a must after Pompeii, I hear)
2. Sansevero Chapel (Veiled Christ)
3. San Gennaro Catacombs
4. Gallerie d'Italia
5. Palazzo Reale
6. Teatro San Carlo (afternoon tour if possible)
7. Pompeii
8. Herculaneum
9. Mount Vesuvius
10. Amalfi Coast / Sorrento
11. Path of the Gods trail (only if it can be clubbed with the Amalfi day trip)
12. A Ferry ride (possibly on way back from Salerno)

*Food & Coffee Wishlist:*

Pizza: 50 Kalò, Starita a Materdei, Diego Vitagliano Pizzeria

Other Food: Cibi Cotti Nonna Anna, Pescheria Castrese

Coffee: Luca's Lounge bar (Any other must-try coffee spots for an enthusiast?)

*My Specific Questions:*

1. Herculaneum vs. Pompeii: I've read Herculaneum is smaller and better preserved, which is tempting. But as a history lover, I feel like I can't miss the scale and significance of Pompeii on a first trip. Is there a significant overlap? Also, am I being ridiculous for even thinking of visiting Mount Vesuvius on the same day as Pompeii, considering the short daylight hours in November?
2. Passes - The Naples pass vs Artecard Napoli: I've looked at the 3-day versions, and my main intention is to save money (and the hassle) of buying individual tickets every day. But I'm struggling to see if it's worth it. It seems expensive for what we can realistically do. Is there a strategic way to use the 3-day pass (e.g., activating it for our last 3 days to cover Pompeii and Naples museums) that actually saves money?
3. Path of the Gods in Late November: I have not heard a lot about this, but I thought this would be a nice trail to hike. Will the views be worth the 3 hour effort during Amalfi day trip? Or am I exerting for no good reason?
4. Local Experience over Sightseeing: We love interacting with local people and soaking in the city's vibe. Are there any ""must-do"" tourist sites on my list that you think we could skip in favor of a more authentic experience, like exploring a specific non-touristy neighborhood or spending more time at a market?
5. Saving Money: Besides potentially the Artecard, what are some other local tips for saving money while still eating and experiencing the best of Naples?
6. Where in Napoli should we stay? We usually prefer couch surfing, but I am not sure if the immigration officer would like that. We currently have a stay booked around  17 Via Montesanto (based on recommendations over here) We will stay at a hotel probably, but I read staying in apartments is bad for the local people and aggravates the housing crisis? Is that true?

I know the list is ambitious, so I'm really looking for help to narrow it down to a fantastic and realistic plan.

Thanks so much in advance for your help and advice! I made the list thanks to some mazing local contributors I hope I can post my final itinerary and help more people.",3,1753378076.0,ItalyTravel,5,1.0,False

1m8am5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1m8am5n/johns_hopkins_sleep_study_my_experience/,Johns Hopkins sleep study - my experience & suggestions,"Last month I went in for a sleep study at Johns Hopkins to assess my sleep apnea. While the Johns Hopkins Sleep Lab sent instructions and recommendations (which you should follow), I made a list which might be of help to anyone doing a sleep study there (or anywhere).

**I am glad I brought:**  
\- All my medications. The on-line check-in information via MyChart did not reach the Sleep Lab; I needed to list each one by hand on paper. This additional and unexpected work might repel any drowsiness you might feel...

\- Snacks to eat in the morning, especially those that give an energy lift. There was nowhere to buy coffee or beverages, though I might have missed a vending machine. I left a water bottle in my car.

\- Small bag for bedtime prep materials (e.g. brushing teeth), etc.

\- earplugs: THIS PLACE IS GODDAMN LOUD! At least one airplane almost landed on the roof. Traffic outside and the expected chatter, sometimes shouted (""Is this the right building?"" ""I HOPE SO, I'M SLEEPY"" - Jesus, really?), continued until 10 pm.

The staff of course, do have to walk around and talk, but every conversation and every footstep is audible, even though the bed is set at least 20 feet into the room. The architect's acousticians were obviously on holiday when designing the building. *Without earplugs I would not have slept at all.*

  
**What surprised me**

It took 45 minutes to complete the paperwork and for the sleep tech connect everything (electrodes, pulse oximeter, etc.).

There was no time for reading or other ramp-down activities. There was a TV in my room but I did not use it.

There was a camera and microphone in my room at the JH Sleep Study Lab. Sometime in the middle of the night I was quite startled to hear the voice of God ask if I needed help.

Every sleep study room has its own dedicated bathroom. Go before getting connected to the electrodes and/or CPAP machine. Going to the bathroom meant summoning the tech with the big red button to get disconnected and then reconnected. I made sure to arrive with voided intestines as sitting on toilet with a coil of cables is not fun, especially when you are sleepy.

**Sleeping**

According to the report, I slept for a total of 3 hours that night: ""The quality and duration of data recording were adequate for analysis and titration of CPAP,"" however ""Therapeutic interval total sleep time \[90 minutes\] was suboptimal for analysis."" *Quelle surprise!*

Sleeping on my side with the electrodes was very difficult. Sleeping with the CPAP machine proved impossible. No mask fit correctly and I felt suffocated quite often.

I was awakened twice to fix loose electrodes and three times to try various CPAP masks (none fit my apparently large face).

My bed at the Sleep Lab was soft like a sponge; I should have asked if different mattress choices were available. The room was incredibly dark; my eyemask went unused.

The gooey electrode paste was not much of a bother, but I'm glad I wore grubby clothes I don't care about as the remnants can get everywhere: your hair, clothes, etc. Shaving my head was not required but I am glad I did. Going bald made (re)attaching loose electrodes easier; the sleep tech told me it is harder to attach electrodes through hair.

I hope this helps!

Hopefully this is allowed. I came from Thunder Bay to be here for my dad, as he suffered a heart attack on May 20th and requires long term care. My 9 year old and I are staying at his house. It's absolutely filthy. I am in need of new bed sheets, pillows and a blanket. I believe it's about the size of a double or possibly a queen. We also need hand towels, cleaning supplies, food, dog food. I basically spent my last money I had until next month on some groceries. A new coffee maker would be ideal. Anything that could possibly help. I don't know where else I could ask for stuff like this, maybe even someone to help clean? I'm stressed out, grossed out and feel overwhelmed.

Since being here my son has developed a rash, most likely contact dermatitis from it being so filthy. 

Thanks in advance. ",0,1753377950.0,Edmonton,9,0.3,False
1m8akyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1m8akyq/efforts_even_after_breakup/,Efforts even after breakup??,"When we were together, I used to give her flowers every time we met.
And we used to meet at least 3–4 times a week. I gave her lilies, roses—always something different. For her birthday, I made her a Polaroid bouquet, which to this day is still the best bouquet I’ve ever created. I went out of my way to make her birthday special. I planned everything. And let me remind you—I was just 18.

But then we had a huge argument—about her male best friend.

Look, I had no problem with that guy. I even used to joke around with him. But there were times she cried over him—real, heavy crying, her eyes turning red. I let it slide 2–3 times. I told myself, “Okay, that’s her best friend, she’ll handle it.” But on her birthday night, she started ranting about him again—right in the middle of a night I worked so hard to make special. That’s when I lost it. Who wouldn’t?

I still didn’t fight him or even curse him. I told my friends—some of whom have been to jail—to just give him a warning, not to touch him, but just say: “Don’t make her cry again.” That’s all I wanted. Because honestly—who can sit quietly while someone makes the girl they love cry?

I dropped her to college in my dad’s car. I woke up early during her exams to pick her up and made sure she had coffee from Darjeeling just to help her stay focused.

When she was hospitalized, I couldn’t visit her because her parents were always around. So instead, I went to Dagdusheth Ganpati Mandir in Pune, and I prayed, “God, please take her pain away. Give it to me instead.”
And while she was in the hospital, I bought her earrings too.

But when I was hospitalized—she didn’t visit me. She had chances. My parents weren’t even around. I told them I could manage alone. But the girl I loved? She didn’t show up. Still, I told myself, “Maybe she’s busy with college.”

I used to cook tiffin for her—biryani, gajar ka halwa, puran poli—and deliver it to her college, which is 10 km away from my home. But I did it because I loved her.

I used to cook for her when we were together at home.
I wrote her poems.
I helped with chores.
Once a mouse got into her house and scared her, so I went over—even though I was scared too—and removed it for her.

We missed our Valentine’s Day anniversary on 14 July because her parents took her out. But on the 17th, we celebrated it at my house.
I cooked:

Butter garlic prawns

Rosemary oil grilled chicken

White sauce pasta

Broccoli
And paired it with red wine and non-alcoholic beer.
I told her to dress up and relax in the hall while I locked myself in the kitchen to cook everything. She looked beautiful in that skirt.


We had arguments—mostly about priorities. That happens in relationships. But the problem was: her friends hated me. Her female best friend's boyfriend was toxic, and they carried that trauma into our relationship. Anytime we fought, she’d tell her friends, and they’d hate me even more.

And still, I kept giving my all. I’m not just some average guy.
I write poems.
I owned a clothing brand.
I cook.
I make music.
I’ve run a podcast on Spotify called Stoic Content.
I garden.
I’ve worked in government hospitals and NGOs, helped street dogs and homeless people.
I skateboard.
Play the harmonica.
I’m good at badminton.
I work out.
And I’m just 19.

She even said I stand out from the average crowd.
But still—on March 8, we broke up.
And her friends had the audacity to say I failed to give her the bare minimum.

After the breakup, she blocked me—and so did her friends and even some of her college mates.
I was like, What the hell?
She disrespected me so badly. Gave cold replies. Laughed at me when I cried in front of her. And this was the same girl I tried to end myself over three or four times while we were still together. Even after we broke up, I tried to hang myself—but my housemaid saved me.

And still—I was there for her.
Even after everything.

When her parents found out about us, it was a mess—typical Indian drama. “We’ll stop your college. Get you married.” She was scared. She cried. And I still comforted her.

Her parents took her phone away.
So I spray-painted quotes outside her house:
“I'm with you.”
“You are strong.”
“Don't cry.”
“God is with us.”

But when college started again, she gave me cold answers.
She laughed at my crying face when I visited her.
Told me, “You were never my type. I just settled for you.”

Two weeks later, she was on dating apps.
My friends sent me screenshots of her profile.
I was crushed.

I still tried to call her.
She blocked me everywhere.
On March 26, she told me, “Don’t take my name from your mouth.”
She said she’d tell my mom if I kept calling.
So I stopped.

On April 6, she called me and said, “It’s not like we’ll never speak again.”
That day I had just fallen off my bike. My leg was bleeding badly. But I still picked up.
Later I told her, “Please block me. I don’t want confusion.” And she did.

In May, I returned the perfume box she gave me on my birthday.
I couldn’t throw it away—it meant something.
I also gave her best friend a few letters to pass on to her.

A few days later, I called her one last time. She didn’t pick up.
Two days later she called, said not to ever contact her again.
She said her parents would kill her if they found out.
But she was still on dating apps.

She still has my shirt—the one I wore on our first date.
I asked if she threw it.
She said no, “It was a gift.”
Same with the earrings and other things I gave her.

After that, I never called. Never texted. No stalking. Nothing.


---

So this year, on 15 July 2025—our first date anniversary—I did something different.
Something for me.
For closure.

I gave flowers to strangers.

I wore a sign that said: “Honk for a free flower.”

People actually did.

A little girl smiled. A guy on a bike said, “Thank you.”

A couple gave me chocolates.

I gave out 34 roses, of four different colors—just like I did on our first date last year.


People were surprised I was 19.
They asked why I was doing it.
I said, “In memory of someone. To honor, grieve, and spread love.”
It felt good.
A small flower changed someone’s whole day.

Then I cooked fried rice, packed 25 food boxes, and gave them to the homeless.
I got so many blessings.

Then I fed street dogs. I was scared one would bite me—but instead, a little puppy jumped on me and started licking me. One of the cutest moments of my life.

And finally, for the goodbye...

I bought two red velvet pastries and wrote three letters:

One to my past love

One to my present self

One to my future


I lit candles, placed the letters, a rose, and gift cards that said:

“Thank you.”

“Always & Forever.”

“Sorry.”


I sat on a bench in the rain, ate one cake, and left the other beside the candles—symbolic of saving one for the past.

Then I got up... and walked away.
I didn’t look back.
Because if I had, I wouldn’t have been able to say goodbye.


---

So here’s to the person who was once in my life.
I loved you.
What we had was real.

Wherever you are, I hope you’re okay.
Because now, I am.
I’m healing—without reaching out.
Thanks for everything.

Even after all the disrespect, even after all the coldness...
I did this for us.

I loved her.

But yeah…
Now I move on.
And I move on in peace.

(Worthy Satire) - In a bold leap forward for romance and regression, a new survey reveals that the majority of Gen Z is willing to marry artificial intelligence — provided the AI can text back consistently and never ghost them during Mercury retrograde.\

Experts warn the trend could lead to a rise in ""cyber-in-laws,"" awkward software updates during wedding vows, and prenups involving cloud storage. Meanwhile, traditional dating apps are scrambling to keep up, with Tinder reportedly developing an AI that can break up with you gently in over 30 languages.\

Critics argue that marrying AI could erode human connection, but Gen Z responded by asking, “What connection?”\

The Department of Marriage and Firmware is expected to issue guidance soon on whether Alexa can legally officiate.\

1m8aeis,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypertension/comments/1m8aeis/hypertension_since_mid_teens_has_now_lead_to_fear/,Hypertension since mid teens has now lead to fear of death.,"First and foremost, hi to everyone. As crazy as it may sound, it feels somewhat reassuring knowing that I am not alone. (I am not a native speaker, sorry if I mess up some things.)

A little bit of backstory first: when I was 15 and went for a summer job, during my medical check-ups I was measured with high BP (140+ / 90+). Ever since then, after some ""detailed"" tests here in Europe, the end conclusion was that I had high BP with no clear reasons why (they blamed it on: this is simply how you are + I had a growth spurt and weight increase at the time which may have contributed).

Fast forward nearly a decade, I am 24 now, in sales, fully stressed out and overworked. Until last month, I was drinking at least 1 if not 2 energy drinks a day, also had Coke Zero, upwards of 1.5L a day, smoking a pack a day, no BP meds, overweight (110kg / 6'4 / sedentary lifestyle). One Saturday night when I went to sleep at 2am, I noticed I couldn't fall asleep, as if I was constantly feeling like I was choking. Eventually, after my inability to sleep, I went to the bathroom to wash my face where I noticed my left eye pupil being dilated about 2x larger than my right. Having a history in my family with stroke (dad has already had 2 strokes), I instantly associated it with a stroke and had a massive panic attack. Went to the ER, did some EKG / ECG, blood work, and got some diuretics into my bloodstream to remove the caffeine from my system. At the ER, my BP was back to the 'normal' range of 140/80–90, 95.

I went to what's considered to be the best cardiologist here in my city. They gave me meds and told me that I am 'fine', I did not have a stroke, I am 'healthy', and that it will take anywhere from 2–5 years for my heart to become ""fully healthy again."" In the meantime, I have developed severe anxiety, severe death fear, and severe panic attacks, which is absolutely what I needed /s.

Fast forward about a month, I haven't drunk a single bit of energy drinks or Coke, at times some coffee if I felt really tired, but only about twice a week maybe. I still smoke, but nowhere near as often as I used to (1 pack every 3 days ±), which to me was a major shift, but for the better (I also lost 3 whole KGs, which is lovely).

On a visit a couple of days ago, I told the doctor that I have constant discomfort in my chest, left arm, pinky, my palm (slightly above my wrist), bicep, back, under my armpits area, my pecs, neck, head (back of my head and around the temples), and eye. ALL on the left side of my body. My pupils are still dilated, although I noticed that it is the right that is usually larger now, but I am not entirely sure which one should be the 'correct size', so it's hard to guess if it's the right one that's acting up or the left one still. I want to mention the fact that most of the pain that I feel feels somewhat surface level, as if it were muscle tear after a big workout. The doctor told me I am fine, that this is all related to my newest addition to the pool of issues, namely the panic attacks and anxiety, and that my nervous system is fried, and that I should take medication X for the pain and that I should try to chill out or go talk with someone (psychiatric).

I want to hear your opinions. What would you do in my place? Would you further investigate it or trust the doctor with my life? I want to do an eye check-up and an RMN (or anything that would do a full brain check just to make sure I didn't have a stroke or anything alike).",2,1753377534.0,hypertension,0,1.0,False

1m8aayo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/1m8aayo/must_read/,Must read ❤️,"Hi friends! I read a lot of posts about people being denied etc and being super bummed about it. I had my first OB one month ago. No symptoms since. 

First and foremost- you need to fall in love with yourself. So fiercely that no denial can shake you. This means diving deep into your internal workings, your overall health, and so forth. Go places you’ve never dared to go before, trying new things you’ve never thought, worshipping yourself in the mirror, taking yourself on dates, defining the standard by which others need to love you, because you love yourself this way.

Next, any new person you’re interested in, make them get a full panel including simplex 1 and 2. I say this because… after I had my first outbreak and was swabbed positive for 1 (had a blood test a month later and my antibodies were at 90, which is the exact border that MIGHT indicate you have it but could still be false. I knew from a swab I was positive, but so y’all know potential timeline with blood testing) I openly discussed my diagnosis with 6 people, encouraging those who have never been tested in their lives to get tested, and… 6 out of 6 people. 100% of them. Positive for 1 or 2. Some of them had similar mini melt downs as I did, baffled and in complete shock that they were carrying, having no idea of it was G or O, etc. and I have a feeling that many people denying those who are positive, have never tested before, and are basing their declinations off of assumptions that they’re negative. Don’t get me started on false negatives and false positives. This virus is so complex!!! I truly can’t believe how many people are as fearful as they are.

I personally have always had a healthy perspective of STD’s. I’m an adult, I’ve been aware of my risk of hsv, of getting pregnant etc. I’ve been less concerned with aids because it’s required to communicate if one is a carrier, but i sympathize deeply with those affected and don’t judge or believe anyone is “nasty” for acquiring any std. Some people act as if we’ve gone out searching to be infected? The only thing nasty is if you are knowingly infecting people. I digress.. tell people you get cold sores to start out, explain it’s still herpes, then have them get tested, then expand upon where you get symptoms and which strain if need be (aka potential partners are showing negative.) I acquired from someone ENTIRELY ASYMPTOMATIC. 

My health protocol (vegan body builder of 15 years, blood panels are always top notch, as are all other bio markers)
- I don’t drink alcohol, I don’t smoke, psilocybin regularly, party drugs occasionally (K, acid, molly once a year MAYBE)
- parasite cleanse regularly (parasites are being linked to cancers etc. pair with enema or colonic.)
- oral health (linked to brain cancer and your gut biome)
- gut biome balance (fermented foods, pre and probies! Directly responsible for your serotonin production, of which alcohol and fried foods kills the biome responsible)
- fasting with hot water and Celtic salt once every week or two (length is different for bio females, research what is best for you. lets your body take out the trash, cellular turn over, decreases cancer cells)
- I pair fasting with heavy metal detox (bentonite clay, charcoal, zeolite)
- shilajit + sea moss (extremely dense in nutrients)
- infrared 
- hyperbaric oxygen sessions (insane immune benefits, cheap sessions on Groupon in major cities) 
- deep SLEEP (I will literally cancel a date with you if I didn’t get enough sleep. Not sorry.)
- supplement stack: magnesium glycinate before bed, monolaurin, lysine (I have 500mg pills and powder to add to smoothies) vitamin d3 + k2, brown seaweed, immunity mushroom blend, greens powder, cats claw, oregano oil, black seed oil. AV on deck in case it’s needed during potentially stressful times. (Stress means anything from not enough consistent sleep, travel, not eating right for several days in a row, etc) I take creatine and vegan protein powder. 
- I haven’t refrained from eating anything. I don’t eat peanuts? I’ve heard this can be a trigger. I’ve had chocolate ice cream sandwiches, almond butter, chocolate chip waffles, etc. no break out. (All vegan)
- I drink out of a metal water bottle and avoid plastics down to my toothbrush bristles 
- I don’t wear synthetic perfumes (endocrine disruption)
- hella tea!! No coffee. Only occasionally matcha. But I’m talking, lemon balm, dandelion root, alkaline and detox blends, all the time, in my belly, yummmm
- for those experiencing intense symptoms, I’ve heard of bee venom having interesting immune benefits. I do not support unethical practices, as unethical practices and people being detached from empathy causes most if not all of our problems 🫠 but am unsure if there is an ethical way about this. If you get stung by a bee; let it corkscrew its way out of you, do not swat it or you remove its body from its stinger and that’s how they die. 
- lastly, I’m a big open minded try everything once and what benefits me more kind of gal. Kambo has no science behind it and could totally be placebo - but placebo STILL WORKS. I was hooked on vapes (heavy metalsss) in my early twenties and did kambo once, and now my body physically rejects vapes by nearly vomiting. Couldn’t believe how this happened. To this day; physically repulsed by what I was literally addicted to and it happened over night. It is an ancient medicine in the spiritual community, known to work wonders as are many other medicines such as ibogaine (I’d be curious about ibogaines potential benefits with hsv, although I understand them to be primarily influential of addiction which is mostly a brain thing.) as with any of this, do your research on your source, be respectful, you’re not some wizard because you don’t rely on big pharma now. (I understand this is collected off the skin of the frog and has risk of being unethical, something I need to look more into myself.)

***Research any interactivity between supplements, with your AV, supplement timing, empty stomach or with food consumption etc. these are all acts of self love as I’ve mentioned earlier.***

*****pretty much research everything I’m saying because I’m a stranger on the internet*****

Self talk is huge. For me personally, I have a strong mental physique - meaning any time something stuns me, I literally talk shit to myself. For example “Simplex 1, and? Some little skin rash going to interfere with my life and my dreams? Yeah fuckin right. Someone might decline me? Most people might decline me? Weeding out the people not meant for me. It’s a cheat code. Look what you’ve been through so far, and look at where you stand, don’t be an ungrateful little shit. This is an opportunity to be stronger. What are you going to do now?”

This doesn’t mean I haven’t felt bummed, as I did in the very beginning, I let myself process healthily. but as time progresses, I’m actually more motivated by it. I please myself sexually (I don’t watch porn and when I self please, I’m literally making love to myself, with internal self talk, internal visuals etc.. try it :). I have amazing bonds. I am incredibly healthy. And I’m definitely not done conquering my life. All as a result of a fierce commitment to loving myself. And as a result - everyone in my life is deeply loved and cared for, and the cycle feeds into itself from all directions. 

If you’re having serious ongoing symptoms, please consider extensive testing (potentially in turkey or Mexico where it’s cheaper? Do hair tests, hormones, blood work, ALLERGY testing, therapy ((long stored trauma in body causing inflammation)) get it all done, so you can figure out where your body needs more support.)
I am not a doctor, but I’m willing to guess ongoing physical response is a result of your immune system not being primed. Once you start something, stick to it for a month at least, it’s going to take time for your body to reach its peak health. 

Lastly, some are immunocompromised. Some were genetically given a lesser hand. Some didn’t catch disease in time, and if you’ve waited too long, we lose the option to cure and only to treat. I commend you and my heart is with you. I do not know your experience, how difficult it’s been, and how much more difficult it may be with hsv or anything else. But I hope at the very least, you feel encouraged to fall in love with yourself more. Every single person on this earth deserves to give themselves that experience, and that’s the thing, nobody can love you like you can love you. So make sure that if you do anything, you do that. 

You only become lesser when you allow yourself to absorb the realities and responses of others. Those things belong to them, you make the choice to carry them. This is much deeper than any illness, although perhaps lack of love is the illness we suffer from universally.

1m8a88p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1m8a88p/recently_reached_a_new_rock_bottom_with_my/,"Recently reached a new rock bottom with my seizures, looking for y'all's thoughts","Hey everyone! 

So I recently spent 5 days on eeg and got no abnormal results(I was taken  off 1 of my meds for a couple of days and made to stay up ~30 hours during that time). I had been admitted to the hospital a couple of days before starting the long eeg after ending up in the ER after having 3 seizures followed by having 1 in front of the ER doctor. Before having an apparent TC in the ER I had apparently begun acting strange- holding up and kissing the ER doctor's hand and my mother's hand. I have no recollection of this- my memory cuts out when I'm talking with a nurse who is taking my vitals in a triage room.

 The thing is- earlier that day I had just broken up with my partner and basically pulled off a single handed move of all of my stuff. I was definitely physically mentally and emotionally stressed and exhausted. 

I awake hours later. In the morning the first neurologist I see suggests that I have epileptic seizures and PNES. 

My epilepsy journey began in oct 2017 at age 24. I had a seizure in my sleep and was found unconscious by my sister who called 911. I had a tongue bite from this incident. Was fully checked out by neuro who told me 1 more seizure and I go on medication. Cut to nov 2021- I'm standing peeing half awake just waking up and next think I know I'm in the bath tub paramedics saying let's go to hospital. Bad tongue bite. From that point to now it's been a blur of seizures and recovering from them with the longest time without one being ~6 months and lately been more like 1-2 months between. I crashed my car having a seizure and stopped driving completely. I experience deja vu feeling to the point of nausea, an automatism(?) of my mouth running to the point where people will ask me what I'm eating, and will sometimes have like a hot flash type experience. 

My first neurologist did several at home multi day eegs, the last of which he claimed to have seen something on. Up till that point I believe I was being treated more for partial seizures (?). The neurologist said something along the lines of - I have generalized seizures, the least severe case he's seen. At this point he totally changed my medicine regime. Previously I had been on several medications- keppra, oxcarbaxepine idr the rest- switched to xcopr and vimpati. 

At some point after my worst injury I have received from a seizure occurred- in my sleep- I switched to the neurologist who treated me in the hospital who was highly recommended by everyone basically and was closer to home. We have been on the same medication path, but at this point I'm on xcopri and vimpat maxed and 8mg fycompa.  I have never had an abnormal eeg with him and getting the eeg transferred to him from my previous neuro has up till now been too difficult to make happen. 

After my 5 day normal eeg my current neurologist has basically said he doesn't know what's up with me and that the current meds I'm on should be helping my epileptic seizures enough. So we're going to stay on my current medication level and I should see a psychiatrist.

 I also want to point out that I was super emotional during my hospital stay, especially towards the end. Just crying a lot basically. For the record- a big seizure event can have me feeling bad for more than a week- depressed and not feeling like myself, unable to focus, and even worse memory than usual. So being admitted and being unable to go outside or basically move at all or have coffee- on top of my super recent breakup (7 years) and traumatic move had me yeah feeling very bad. I'm seeing the expensive psych he suggested next week.

I'm not saying I don't have pnes. In fact, it seems like having both might be the most reasonable explanation. I'm just afraid that me being super emotional in the hospital has made my neurologist write me off as an emotional nut-case (which, again I'm not saying I'm not at this point lol!). The whole thing is just making me question my own experience and I feel just too tired to keep looking for the cause and the solution.

TLDR: After multi day eeg with no abnormal results epileptologist is sending me to psychiatrist. Previous epileptologist claimed to have seen something on previous multi day eeg but transferring info too hard/ maybe pointless? Previously my seizures presented pretty typically but now acting weird sometimes before having apparent TC. Not getting better and idk what to do.

Being present after loss isn’t about pretending to be okay. It isn’t about moving on or being grateful all the time. It’s about learning how to stay. Stay with yourself. Stay in your body. Stay in your life, even when it’s heavy with sorrow.

This part of grief isn’t loud. It’s not something most people notice. But it matters. Because presence—real presence, even in short glimpses—is how you begin to steady yourself again. It’s how you start to feel your own life beneath the fog.

Here are some of the quiet places where presence can begin to show up.

**The Ordinary as Anchor**

When everything has been upended, the smallest acts can become lifelines. Making coffee. Letting the dog out. Folding a towel. There’s nothing glamorous about it, but there’s something grounding.

These simple rhythms don’t erase grief, but they remind your body that you're still here. And that matters.

If your days feel chaotic or shapeless, that’s normal. Grief scrambles your sense of time. But even one tiny rhythm—brushing your teeth in the morning, lighting a candle at night—can begin to shape the edges of your day. You don’t have to do everything. You just have to begin.

**Letting Light In, Even When It Feels Wrong**

There might come a moment—maybe just one—when something makes you smile. A song. A breeze. A child’s laughter. And then, almost immediately, guilt steps in.

How can I feel joy when they’re gone?

But joy is not betrayal. It’s a sign that you’re alive.

You can feel joy and still miss them. You can laugh and still love them. Grief and gladness are not opposites. They can live side by side. Let that moment of light land. Don’t chase it. But don’t block it either. Let it be what it is—a moment.

**Creating Rhythms That Reflect Who You Are Now**

There is quiet strength in choosing something. In deciding how your day begins or ends. In picking a small ritual and making it yours.

Light a candle. Write one sentence in a journal. Make the same breakfast every morning. Tend a plant. Play a song. These are not routines for productivity. They are choices that remind you of who you are becoming.

If a full routine feels like too much, try asking your body what it needs. Movement? Stillness? Warmth? Rest? Then give it that, just once. Just enough.

These aren’t rules. They’re invitations.

**Soothing the Overwhelm in Your Body**

Grief doesn’t just live in your heart. It lives in your nervous system. It tightens your muscles. Speeds up your breath. Floods your brain with alarms.

This is your body trying to protect you.

Sometimes, presence looks like taking a deep breath and placing a hand on your chest. Or wrapping yourself in a blanket. Or putting your feet flat on the ground and feeling gravity hold you.

You don’t have to be calm all the time. You just need enough steadiness to keep going. Tiny practices of self-soothing can help remind your body that, for this moment, you are safe enough to be here.

**Presence Isn’t a Performance**

You don’t have to be grateful. You don’t have to feel peaceful. You don’t have to fall in love with your life right now.

But if you can notice this moment—and stay with yourself inside it—that’s presence.

Some days you’ll feel more here. Some days you’ll feel far away, like you’re watching life through a window. That’s grief too.

What matters is returning. Not perfectly. Just gently. Returning to your breath. Your body. Your day.

When you stay with yourself, you’re saying: I am worth showing up for.

And that is a powerful act of love.

**Questions to Sit With**

* What part of my day feels most grounding—and what tends to knock me off center?
* Is there a simple ritual I could try, just once today?
* Have I noticed any moment of peace or warmth lately, even a flicker?
* What does my body feel like when I’m overwhelmed—and what helps me soften just a little?
* Is there a sound, texture, or scent that brings me even a small sense of safety?
* Can I name a moment this week when I felt present, even briefly?

But this gives us a chance to change things, to speak up and talk about the things that matter; the good of our nation and unity against the abusers of the american system. 

Let’s be honest, we shouldn’t be turning our attention to dismember our neighbors and coworkers for who they voted for. The truth is, most people eventually regret voting for a person in power, because there isn’t a politician honest and straight shooting enough to stick to their ideals and stick with their supporters, and to always do it for the good of the nation. 

Congressmen and women shouldn’t be able to have stock, where corporations and shareholders can make the rules. 

We shouldn’t have to have politicians who are always a generation or more older than the working class.

Whether or not you agree with me on any of these points, we do need to let people know we care about them. To care for our fellow Americans. To bring together what politicians tear apart for their own goals. No side is innocent here, neither party is one you should endorse, you know you would do it differently and these people in power and not representatives of us, but representatives of who has the deepest pockets and the most polished lies.

**Reflections from a Burned Garden**

*“In the burned house I found a sprig of lilac.”
—Margaret Atwood*

I work with children who have been through more than most of us can imagine. As a nurse in pediatric psychiatric care, I meet children whose suffering cannot be tidied into clinical terms. Some have watched their parents die by murder-suicide. Another child I met spent the first nine years of his life living outside—not camping, not in a cabin, but literally in the woods. No home. Just the trees and dirt. When he came to our unit, he told me how fancy the sheets felt.

Sometimes I wish there were magic words to make it all better. But there aren’t. Not really.

What we can do, though, is be there with them. We can sit beside them in the sadness. We can show them kindness, again and again, even if they’re not sure how to accept it yet. That’s how healing begins: not with fixing, but with being.

I like to think of children like a garden. Some have been through fires. The soil is burned and dry. But gardens can grow again, even from ashes. It just takes time and care from people who believe it's worth trying.

Is that hopeful? Yes, but it’s not hope that erases pain, or that guarantees outcomes. It’s not hope that everything will turn out fine. It’s the hope of showing up. Of planting seeds even when you may never see the bloom.  It’s the hope that persists because I’ve seen what happens when someone feels truly seen. Even once. 

Is it naive? Some may dismiss this hope as sentimentality. Yet research in human development says otherwise. Children who have experienced profound trauma form new neural pathways when they encounter consistent, attuned, and emotionally safe caregivers. Neuroplasticity doesn’t undo the past, but it enables resilience and repair. Even a child who has never been hugged can rewire their brain in the presence of warmth and consistency. Small acts like keeping a routine, offering a calm tone,  and showing up reliably become scaffolding for trust, growth, and a brighter future.

I don’t think any child is beyond hope. Not one. But I understand how someone might start to feel that way, especially when they look at the world and see how many children are hurting, and how few people seem to notice. These children do not arrive in our care by accident. This is not random. 

These stories aren’t hidden. They’re not locked in confidential files or buried beneath complex diagnoses. They’re walking down our sidewalks, and sitting in our classrooms. Still, somehow, we do not see them. Not because they are invisible, but because we have trained ourselves not to look.

It is the result of a culture that prizes profit over people, isolation over connection, punishment over care. They fall through cracks shaped by policies, budgets, and values that reflect who and what we choose to protect. We are the wealthiest nation in history, and yet children are sleeping in dirt. They are living inside institutions while begging to die so they can be with their families. 

So what choice do we have but to respond with compassion—not just as feeling, but as action? When we plant even one seed of dignity in the life of a suffering child, we are resisting not only despair, but the machinery that produces it. We live in a time when it’s easy to turn away. But if you care enough to look, you’ll see there are children everywhere who need gentleness, safety, and love. And maybe, just maybe, if we help them feel safe enough, they’ll grow into adults who offer that compassion to others too.

That’s how a better world begins. 

So no, there is no fix. But there is a vow and one I offer to anyone who dares. A vow to remain. To bear witness. To hold the ember, even when the fire has passed, to tend the soil even when it feels hopeless. If there is one truth I return to, it is this: even in scorched earth, there are seeds. And tending them, quietly and with devotion, may be the most radical act of all.

1m89zmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1m89zmi/lab_rodent/,LAB RODENT,"We are both incredibly horny. We fuck like rabbits, almost every day. I eat her out all the time, as it is one of my favorite things to do. About 3 months ago, I noticed a different smell coming from her than usual. Nothing crazy, but different. IT took me a few days, but I finally placed the smell. LAB RODENT. Her v4gina smells like lab rodent. I figured she might have been coming down with a UTI or something, so I asked her if she had any discomfort. She said no. She's super open with me about these things, and over the years of our friendship and then romance I've brought her cranberry juice and monistat multiple times and she's always been open about these kind of things.  She actually was the first person I told that I have had an STD, and she was totally chill with it and supportive. On the topic of that STD, my ex boyfriend ended up passing it to me because he was cheating on me. She has also been cheated on before, and our history is one of the many reasons for the transparency in our relationship.  I mention this because I know there will be comments telling me that she's cheating on me and that's why she smells different. I trust her implicitly. She's not cheating on me, and if she had, which I have no reason to believe she has, we'd just talk about it. Besides, what would that mean? That that guy has a rat dick? 

I thought that I might have a rat dick. After all, I work in a lab. I come home smelling like chemicals because I mount tumors on slides all day. I wear a lab coat, leave my shoes at the door, immediately shower when I get home and put my work clothes in a separate hamper. It's not like I work with infectious disease, but it just makes sense to keep things separate. I do not smell like lab rat at all. I have asked her if I smell ok dozens of times, and she says that I smell like I usually do. I asked her to elaborate, and she said I smell like skin and soap. Lab rodent does not smell like skin and soap. 

There's not really a way she would have been in contact with lab animals on her own- she works a 9-5 in marketing (which she KILLS at). No stories of work or coworkers or friends or enemies or her spin class or any of her general going on's have ever given me any inkling that they involve rodents. 

I googled rodent v4gina and regretted it instantly. I don't know why I did that. Dead end. Nothing I know about the female body has prepared me for this. Every single article I have read about a change in smell has lead to nothing. I have been desperately trying to find a change in our life that would have resulted in this change. She has not changed her diet, birth control, supplements, or clothing in the past 3 months. The scent goes away on her period but comes back when it's done. I do the laundry and have not changed any products. Toilet paper is the same, there's no smell in her underwear drawer when I was putting her clothes away, her shampoo/conditioner/bodywash/bodylotion/sunscreen are ALL the same as always. I feel like I'm going nuts, and she's noticed how weird I've been. She hasn't brought it up yet, but I can see that she's looking at me funny when I do weird stuff like this. It's impacted our sex life, which isn't the end of the world, but I know it's making her worry about me. 

How in god's name do I bring this up to her? Do I bring it up to her? I would do it immediately if I thought that it was dangerous. I'm not concerned with safety, I'd just bewildered. I'd be making an observation on the most sensitive part of her body for my own curiosity. How do I even say that? Good morning beautiful, coffee’s in the pot, eggs on the stove, you have rat pussy? Did you water the rodent v4gina? I mean rhododendron? Smell this lab rat cart, remind you of anything? I feel like i am losing it. ",2,1753376605.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False

➡️ My back was killing me. 
➡️ My energy was shot. 
➡️ And I kept blaming my chair, my desk, even my laptop screen.

But here's what I discovered…

Most of us are trying to fix our energy crashes with the wrong solutions.

We buy standing desks, fancy chairs, blue light glasses.

Meanwhile, we're eating a bagel at 9 AM and wondering why we crash at 11.

Your blood sugar rollercoaster is sabotaging everything. 

When you spike and crash, your body compensates by tensing up. 

That tension? 
It goes straight to your back.

➡️ I switched to protein for breakfast. 
Greek yogurt, protein powder and maybe some berries.

Within two weeks, my afternoon crashes disappeared. 

My back pain? Down by 60%.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: 
Your energy and your back pain are connected. 

When you're constantly fighting fatigue, your posture suffers. 
When your posture suffers, everything hurts.

📶 Fix your fuel, fix your foundation.

1m89yt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1m89yt3/explore_afuncrafter_cord_organizer_review_is_this/,Explore AFunCrafter Cord Organizer Review Is This Kitchen Gadget Worth Your Time?,"Keeping my kitchen area clutter-free always feels like a constant battle, and the AFunCrafter Cord Organizer (model Cord Organizer) has proven to be a surprisingly handy tool in this never-ending war. Testing it in my own kitchen setup, I found that this small but efficient accessory brought in more organization than I initially anticipated. Of course, it’s not without its quirks, but overall, it adds value to daily appliance management.

**Sleek and Practical Design**  
Starting with its design, the organizer's compact dimensions (4.05 x 1.1 x 0.04 inches) fit seamlessly on various appliances without looking awkward. Its subtle color palette—black, grey, and white—blends well with modern kitchen aesthetics. The silicone material feels sturdy yet flexible, making it easy to work with, even on curved surfaces like the back of my Kitchenaid mixer. Installing the product was fairly straightforward thanks to its self-adhesive style, though I did notice the adhesive needs a little extra pressure for optimal sticking.

**Performance and Durability**  
This cord organizer genuinely excels at wrangling the chaotic wires from kitchen appliances like air fryers, pressure cookers, and coffee makers. During testing, I appreciated how the larger adhesive area holds better than cheaper alternatives I've used in the past. The stronger adhesive claims are not just marketing fluff—they stick robustly, even when I accidentally snagged the cord during routine cleaning. However, I wouldn’t try asking it to hold cords heavier than it’s designed for (like industrial-grade equipment).  

[Check AFunCrafter Cord Organizer price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0b9ggfnlb/)

**Versatile and Family-Friendly**  
The fun thing about this organizer is its versatility. I’ve used one on my toaster, another on a pressure cooker, and even managed to stick one onto my kid’s art supply station to organize cables for their glue gun. The silicone’s heat resistance up to 158°F reassured me, especially when using it on appliances that tend to warm up during operation. Even my clumsy teenager couldn’t damage it, and believe me, they’ve broken sturdier gadgets than this.

**Highlights**  
- Keeps appliance cables neat and off counters  
- Flexible silicone material works even on curved devices  
- Heat-resistant up to 158°F  
- Significantly stronger adhesive compared to alternatives  

**Hurdles to Consider**  
For how practical this product is, there are a few minor annoyances. Let’s talk about limitations:  
- Placement is key. Once adhered, repositioning it can be a nightmare without ruining the sticky backing.  
- Dust or grease on appliances reduces its sticking power, so wiping down surfaces before use is a must.  
- Some users (including me) found that thicker cables still struggle to fit snugly in the center plug holder.  

**Competing Products**  
Naturally, I had to pit the AFunCrafter cord organizer against similar products in the market. Compared to generic copycat models, this one feels noticeably more durable and better designed. Some competitors also skimp on adhesive quality, so cables inevitably start falling off within days—something I haven’t encountered with this piece. However, pricier alternatives often include additional features like clip-on installations instead of adhesive, which could work better in rentals or temporary setups. If you’re not ready to commit to sticky solutions, those may appeal more.

**Smart Spending**  
Is it worth the cost? For the level of convenience and tidiness it brings to your kitchen, I’d say it’s a sensible investment for most households. Unlike lesser products that require frequent replacement or fail to secure cords properly, this one excels in delivering a sustainable solution without frequent fixes or headaches.

1m89xyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1m89xyk/on_the_road_again/,On the Road Again,"I died and I can’t express that any more simply. I could make it a little more colloquial or flowery by saying he croaked, he dropped dead, he passed away but that’s all in the eyes of the one describing what happened to the other. I died. That is the easiest way to say it. But how can I be saying that about myself? Well, that’s the story and the story isn’t quite as simple as saying I died but let me take you back to last February. Wait, you are thinking this is just some author trying to be clever to grab my attention. All I can do is tell you and you can make up your own mind.

Back to last February. It was a cold and dark night. Seriously! I want to be as clear as possible and yes, it sounds like the most cliched phrase ever uttered for a beginning of a story but it is true. It was dark and it was damned cold! Remember this is Canada and February is our dead of winter! How cold was it? I suppose you want that in Fahrenheit? We use the Celsius scale and have been since the late 60’s or thereabouts so bear with me a second. It was minus 25 Fahrenheit so let me reiterate — it was damned cold. Oh, and it was a moonless night. There were no clouds so there was the vast panoply of stars and a hint of the Northern Lights. I was coming home from the pub and no I was not driving — I had left my keys with the bartender at around 10pm and asked permission to leave my truck over night and I would pick it up the next day when they opened for brunch. Sam, the owner, had created a keyboard. No, not that kind of keyboard but one where his patrons could leave their keys with him and they could have overnight parking for free as long as they picked up their vehicles the next day. The ‘keyboard’ was a big hit and Sam could rest easy at night knowing he was contributing to the roads being a little safer in his town. Patrons would sheepishly pick up their vehicles the next day and pretty much every one of them would slip a twenty into the tip jar and to the amusement of everyone at the bar, whoever was on duty would press a button and play a song snippet that had Willie Nelson crooning “On the Road Again”. How could you not love Mac’s Bar and Grill? It was my home away from home and I got to walk home a lot. I always chalked it up to needing more exercise. More often than not, I could have taken a cab home but I only lived a mile away and I loved the early morning stillness and solitude.

I had a habit of counting my steps on the way home but I never found out exactly how many it took me to get to my front door. Something would always interrupt my train of thought or I would simply lose track. Once I hit one thousand it got harder and by that time I’d either be thinking of work or Gilly. Gilly was my wife of 19 years. She got very sick and died. Yes, just like that. I miss her all the time and maybe that is why I spend so much time at Mac’s and walking home. I say I like the solitude but I really don’t. I fill it up with numbers and statistics and counting things to get my mind off of Gilly and how quickly she vanished. She fills my waking thoughts still and I cannot bear being in my house any longer because I know I have to clean it out and pack things and move on but I just can’t.

We never had children. We tried early on but something was wrong inside her and she could never conceive so we decided to be content with just having each other. We had a wonderful life together filled with adventures and day trips and vacations but one of our favourite pastimes was simply reading. Reading on a rainy day snuggling under a blanket on our veranda was something we looked forward to every spring. We knew when it was going to rain and we would make our coffees and teas (she loved teas and I loved coffee). Just like excited children we’d pick new books from our library and fight to be the first one to sit on the front porch swinging couch. So many times our hips would bump and we’d spill our coffees so we started putting our drinks in thermos mugs and we’d still rush to be the first one on the porch. How many springs, how many bumped hips and spilled coffees and teas over the years? I miss those moments more than anyone can know.

So I am walking home from Mac’s on a dark and cold February night in Canada where the outdoor thermometers are saying it is -32C (yes that is -25F) or as we like to say damned cold and I lose track of how many steps I have taken and I feel a bump on my hip and in that instant I know it is Gilly. My heart leaps as I just know it is her pushing past me to get to the porch and the swinging couch, book and tea mug in hand. I stumble and fall forward and it is no longer damned cold and I can hear the rain rushing down the gutter and filling the rain barrel. I have a hot coffee in my hand and the biggest smile on my face. I have a new book and I have no idea what the story will be about but the title made me think of Mac and all my walks home and Willy Nelson’s soulful voice crooning “On the Road Again”.

(Issue 49 / 2020 Yearbook)

This story will now be republished in *Unbroken: New Tales By Masters of Fantasy*, an upcoming anthology of SF&F stories from 32 different writers.

The book will launch via [a kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unbroken/unbroken-new-tales-by-masters-of-fantasy) which opens on September 23rd. 

> Hey everyone! I’m excited to announce my participation in the UNBROKEN anthology, which is being published to help fellow author, @PeterOrullian, with some medical bills. Peter is a good guy, so I was happy to contribute a Fractalverse short story—ALLIES—which previously was only available in one of Ferrari’s end-of-year coffee table books. Make sure to check it out! ([source](https://x.com/paolini/status/1948409577201946837))

""Allies"" is a pretty short story, clocking in at under 2,000 words. It's takes place shortly after the events of To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, and the story is set on the orbital ring around Earth.

Christopher has mentioned this story a few times previously, and he's spoken about it in some depth during his first stop of the book tour for Fractal Noise:

> *I actually wrote a short story after To Sleep came out that's set on an orbital ring around Earth. It's called ""Allies"", and I'm not trying to brag, but the reason I wrote it and where it came out was Ferrari does an end of year coffee table book, and they solicit short stories from people for their coffee table book. My dead Italian grandfather would have risen from the grave and slapped me outside the head if I had not given Ferrari a short story. By the way, do any of you know what an orbital ring is, or how it works? They are amazing. So the problem with a space station and other things, like if you put it in orbit, it has to move around the Earth, or it just falls down, right? It's in free fall. So it's falling, and it's falling around, and the rate at which it falls matches the curvature of the Earth, so it doesn't hit the surface of the ground. Great. Problem is you have no gravity up in the space station, so everything just floats. So some physicists had this bright idea that you could put a chain in orbit of some ferrous metal. It could even be beads. And you surround it by electromagnets, and you accelerate it, just like the trains that use the magnets to levitate. Same sort of thing. So you accelerate this chain, these beads, whatever. And as they accelerate, they want to go outward. And if you accelerate them enough, they will hold the ring in place, in orbit. And so you just build a platform around it, and then you can stand on the platform. And even if this is like as high as the space station currently is, the space station actually experiences most of the gravity we feel here on Earth. It's just they're falling in a circle. So you can actually stand on this ring and move around, build a house, live a life, grow a garden, whatever. I mean, you might die from lack of oxygen, but put a dome over it. So orbital rings are fantastic. And the cool thing is you can just take an elevator up to one. But since it was a story for Ferrari, I actually had a Ferrari race taking place on an orbital ring around Earth. We haven't released that in other formats yet, but we're looking at that. So yes, we will see more of Earth. Earth stories do feature. I think it'd be a fascinating thing to visit an Earth where it has a massive orbital ring in the Fractalverse in 250 years in the future.*",2,1753376319.0,Fractalverse,2,1.0,False
1m89umd,https://www.reddit.com/r/bermuda/comments/1m89umd/i_loved_my_visit/,I Loved My Visit,"I just wanted to write a small letter to the locals to say that I absolutely fell in love with your country.

I grew up living on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina during the summers (and worked in tourism there throughout high school), and I also routinely visit family in Charleston and have friends who work in tourism/hospitality there. Visiting Bermuda felt like hanging out with a quiet British cousin of those places that I am very familiar with (particularly from a tourism standpoint). I was traveling with people who were doing more of a tourist trip so I went along and did some of the typical touristy things, but with a slightly different perspective as someone who has worked on the other side of ""beach/golf tourism"" for lack of a better term. Here are some of my thoughts as I reflect on my trip, would love to engage in a discussion and to hear whether you agree or disagree with my impressions:

\- You're quite smart to put all the cruise ships and touristy places in one spot, well away from where everyone else lives. Charleston had a cruise ship terminal that dumped passengers right in the middle of downtown, and most locals agree that it was a scourge because it was too close to where locals work and live (the port let their contract with Carnival expire, likely because the wealthy residents hated it). I did have to laugh when I saw Carnival Sunshine in Kings Wharf, because her home port used to be in Charleston; it felt a bit like having your coffee served by the girl who bullied you in high school lol. The ferry was quite nice and I imagine that having a ferryful of cruise passengers into St. George's is much easier to deal with because they have to go away on the last ferry before the end of the day.

\- I loved the weather and it felt quite familiar to me. Hilton Head also gets the same summer squalls, but they come with a lot of lightning, which can be scary around water (I used to have to beg clueless tourists to please get indoors). Being caught in the rain in Bermuda on the other hand was just a nice excuse for a tea break and to enjoy the sound of the rain; I love a good rainstorm, and the humidity is very similar to coastal SC and where I live now in NC. But I did wonder: do the British visitors melt in the heat and sun?

\- On that note, I absolutely love the way Bermudians capture rainwater with their roofs! I used to live in CA and had to be very conscious of water usage in some places there, so I appreciate the effort that goes into water conservation. I heard that you guys have had a few months with little rain, so I was glad to wake up to rainfall in the mornings and I really am just obsessed and impressed by how well the roof systems work to collect water for residents. I think we have too many oak trees in coastal SC for this system to work (or else I'd want to try one on our home in Hilton Head), but I'm glad it works so well in Bermuda.

\- I think we mostly have the same fish species, but you have much more abundant pelagic fish than we have in SC. We can find wahoo this time of year and we have plenty of mahi-mahi, but you have to go out offshore into the Gulf Stream to get them. Our restaurants instead focus more on rockfish, prawns and shellfish which are more abundant closer to shore around the tidewaters. So I ate a LOT of wahoo on this trip lol. If it were my trip to plan, I would have loved to learn more about the ecology of the island, so please feel free to drop resources here for me to check out if you have any!

\- All the locals were so polite and tolerant! If you work in tourism, I wish for good tourists to come your way and I hope they tip you well. I overheard enough dumb questions to know that you must all have a lot of patience and a good sense of humour.

\- I didn't stay at the Rosewood but visited it during the day, and I'll be honest: it kind of creeped me out with all the colonial vibes. Felt a bit like visiting a Charleston-area plantation if nobody acknowledged that it was funded and built by slavery. I know that Bermuda has a different history from the Southern US with regards to slavery, but my understanding is that we were still very intertwined in a complicated way throughout colonialism and the US Civil War, and I learned that Bermuda had some issues for a while with segregation, civil representation, and land ownership along racial lines. Seeing such a large and grand chunk of land that seemed purpose-built to feel exclusionary and devoted to wealthy British expats felt off to me, especially because the patrons in the lounge all seemed like Tories from the UK. I don't fully know the history of that specific area and would love to learn whether there's a reason it gives me the ick.

\- Along those lines, Bermuda generally felt very pro-monarchy. I'd love to hear some perspectives on this from locals, as I wasn't about to probe on this topic while visiting. But at a time when Jamaica is trying to leave the commonwealth and Australia is re-evaluating its relationship with the UK and monarchy, the Bermuda I saw felt very rooted in an ethos of closeness with a certain segment of British society. Has that been changing at all or has the history of self-governance and visits by Elizabeth II endeared Bermuda to a greater identity within the commonwealth?

\- I'm also curious how you all feel about the reinsurance industry in Bermuda? I live in a finance city and that industry attracts a certain type, so I'm fascinated by the idea of what it must be like to live alongside an insurance hub like that.

Anyways, those are just a few of the disparate thoughts I've had in my head about Bermuda since arriving back in the US; happy to answer any questions . Someday I'd love to come back for emancipation day; I loved seeing the banners and displays about the cup match!

Edit, one more thought: loved the buses, but why is there no map showing which route each bus takes? The Shorelink app has a list of stations for each bus, but what am I meant to do if I have no idea where those stations are lol.",10,1753376310.0,bermuda,1,1.0,False

Upon further investigation, a few are scattered around the area, and there are also some scattered ones under the cabinets in small spaces around kitchen. 
Pest control guy came over and wasn’t very sure - he put some mouse traps and sprayed for cockroaches, but not sure that’s what these are. They look almost like miniature eggs, and some of them have little patterns on them, almost like how a carpet beetle looks (not those though; these aren’t alive to my knowledge).

Hi ere thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve had no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know.

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!",2,1753376204.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1m89pun,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1m89pun/how_i_psyopd_my_brain_into_becoming_the_person_i/,How I psyop’d my brain into becoming the person I used to envy:  reading and gym rewired my reality,"Two years ago I was chronically exhausted, scrolling through TikTok until 2AM, skipping workouts, and saying yes to things I didn’t even want to do. My attention span was trash. I kept telling myself I needed to get it together, but nothing stuck. Not habit trackers, not goal lists, not even “deep work” YouTube. Everything collapsed and the second life got overwhelming. I wasn’t lazy. I was living from a story that said, “I’m just not a disciplined person.” Then I read one sentence in Atomic Habits that cracked something open: Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become. That’s when it hit me, my brain wasn’t resisting change. It was protecting an old identity. I decided to psyop myself. And it worked. Here’s how.

This sounds wild but I started studying how the brain filters reality. Cognitive science calls it “predictive processing.” Your brain constantly scans for info that matches what it already believes. It’s called confirmation bias. So if your story is “I suck at follow-through,” your brain literally filters out proof to the contrary. But here’s the glitch, if you feed your brain a new story and back it up with action, it starts scanning for that instead.

I didn’t fake it. I built what I call “identity anchors”, small actions that confirmed the story I wanted to believe.I didn’t say “I’m a beast in the gym.” I just did 10 pushups and logged it.I didn’t say “I’m the next Ryan Holiday.” I just read for 10 minutes a day and underlined quotes.I didn’t say “I’m super productive.” I just started my day with one focused task and stacked from there.

Every action became data. And your brain can’t argue with data.

Here’s what actually worked better than any “productivity hack”:

* Install identity anchors: small actions that match the person you want to be
* Track completions, not streaks, it’s about reps, not perfection
* Create “follow-through proof” from random wins (like finishing a podcast series)
* Prime your brain by scripting your ideal day out loud every morning
* Change your inputs, only consume content from people who live how you want to live
* Use visual cues, make your book/gym gear visible and easy to access
* Design dopamine loops for growth, not distraction (yes, that means deleting TikTok)

These tools rewired how I saw myself. And once the identity flipped, everything got easier.

Some stuff that radically changed my thinking (and life):

Atomic Habits by James Clear: Global bestseller for a reason. This book breaks down behavior change using real neuroscience, not fluff. The identity-based habit model made me realize I was reinforcing the wrong narrative. After this book, I stopped trying to “fix” myself and started proving I already had discipline. Insanely good read.

The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest: If you’ve ever felt stuck and couldn’t explain why, this book will break you open. It’s a deep dive into self-sabotage and how to rebuild your internal belief systems. I felt like she was reading my mind. This is the best book I’ve ever read on emotional discipline.

Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins:  It’s not just about toughness, it’s about identity. Goggins literally rewired his brain through action. His “cookie jar” method (collecting proof of your resilience) helped me build confidence from small wins. I used to think I wasn’t built like that. This book showed me I could be.

BeFreed: My friend put me on this smart reading app developed by scientists from Columbia. It lets you pick how deep you want to go, 10/20 min summaries, or full 40-min deep dives. You can customize your own reading host’s voice & tone (mine has a smoky voice like Samantha from Her, lowkey addictive). The app builds a learning roadmap for you based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I use it to crush books on discipline, psychology, and even investing, while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I’d be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I’ve replaced TikTok with knowledge.

Huberman Lab: Dr. Andrew Huberman shares science-backed tips for rewiring your brain for focus, discipline, and energy. His stuff on dopamine and routines changed how I approached mornings. I used his cold exposure + NSDR + gym combo to reset my brain. Best free education on the internet.

Modern Wisdom: Chris Williamson interviews thinkers like Naval, Cal Newport, and Jordan Peterson. His conversations go deep into psychology, self-mastery, and discipline. I listen while lifting or meal prepping, beats music, and I always leave with a mental upgrade.

I used to scroll to escape myself. Now I read to evolve. Changing your life isn’t about forcing discipline. It’s about feeding your brain a new story until it believes it’s true. Once it does, it wants to help you succeed.

1m89ko7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1m89ko7/meat_smoke_and_sugar_crashes_a_steak_knife_tour/,"Meat, Smoke, and Sugar Crashes: A Steak Knife Tour of Buenos Aires","Buenos Aires eats with its teeth. Not its eyes, not its phone, not a dainty fork held at some precious angle. This is a city that chews loudly, drinks its caffeine through a metal straw, and double-kisses you on the cheek before you’ve finished chewing. It’s seductive in a blunt kind of way. Red meat on an open flame, bitter mate poured from dented thermoses, and the brutal honesty of alfajores stuffed with dulce de leche.

You don’t need a map in Buenos Aires. You need an appetite and a willingness to sit elbow-to-elbow with strangers in a room filled with charcoal smoke. Parrillas, those holy steakhouses that dot every barrio from Palermo to San Telmo, are not restaurants. They’re altars. On weekends, the line spills onto the sidewalk, elbows out, tongues wagging, and kids kicking soccer balls against graffiti-covered walls while grown men obsess over cuts of cow that haven’t mooed in a week.

Beef consumption in Argentina is not a hobby, it’s practically doctrine. According to the Instituto de Promoción de la Carne Vacuna Argentina (IPCVA), the country’s per capita beef consumption reached 53.4 kilograms in 2023. That’s down from the gluttonous highs of the mid-20th century, but still enough to make a vegetarian cry softly into their lentils. The meat is good. Aged, marbled, and kissed with smoke and fire. Order bife de chorizo, entraña, or vacío. Pair it with malbec. No need to look at a menu. Menus are for tourists who still think “medium rare” is a suggestion, not a threat.

Mate culture is a different beast. It doesn’t have the fireworks of steak, but it’s omnipresent. Bitter, vegetal, and poured with the precision of a chemist, yerba mate is drunk from a gourd using a bombilla. A metal straw that filters out the leaves. You see it everywhere. In parks, on buses, and behind counters at butcher shops. Groups pass around a single mate cup in ritualized silence or loud banter, depending on the mood and the crowd. A 2022 report from the National Institute of Yerba Mate (INYM) revealed Argentines consumed over 276 million kilograms of yerba mate that year, with 90% of the population drinking it regularly.

Alfajores serve a different purpose. They’re the edible cigarette break of the porteño. Shortbread cookies glued together with sticky dulce de leche, dipped in chocolate or powdered with sugar. You’ll find them in kiosks, gas stations, bookstores, and train platforms. There are fancy ones from Havanna, crumbly ones from La Recoleta bakeries, and mass-produced ones that taste like childhood and caramelized regret. A 2023 study from Kantar showed alfajores ranked as the second most consumed snack in Argentina, just behind empanadas. The country eats them year-round, with spikes during national holidays and World Cup games.

Tourism data shows Argentina welcomed over 7.4 million international visitors in 2023, with Buenos Aires drawing more than 45% of them. Most come between March and May or September and November, when the weather is mild and the dollar-to-peso conversion feels like cheating. The Argentine peso, perpetually in a tailspin, has turned the city into one of the best-value destinations on the continent. You can eat like royalty for the cost of a Subway sandwich in Manhattan. And you should.

Don’t be lured into the tango shows. They’re fine if you like sequins and disappointment. Better to spend an evening at a milonga. A real one, in a smoky club in Almagro or Villa Crespo, where couples in sneakers and leather jackets dance face-to-face in close, unbreakable embraces. Or wander the San Telmo market on Sunday, where antiques, choripán, and accordion players create a haze of noise and grilled sausage smoke.

Buenos Aires is best explored with hunger and without a schedule. The Subte (subway) is functional, the colectivos (buses) are chaotic, and the sidewalks have more holes than a mafia informant. Wear boots. Bring cash. Accept the fact that time here bends. A 9 p.m. dinner means you eat at 10. A 2 a.m. bar run means you’re home by sunrise. And breakfast? It’s coffee and a medialuna, unless you’ve already cracked into your stash of alfajores.

Don’t try to romanticize this place. Buenos Aires is already romantic enough with its chipped paint, its stubborn elegance, and the constant whiff of empanadas from some back alley oven you’ll never find again. Eat the steak. Sip the mate. Take the alfajor and walk it off in a city that doesn’t want your approval. Just your appetite.

1m89jkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1m89jkt/how_i_psyopd_my_brain_into_becoming_the_person_i/,How I psyop’d my brain into becoming the person I used to envy:  reading and gym rewired my reality,"Two years ago I was chronically exhausted, scrolling through TikTok until 2AM, skipping workouts, and saying yes to things I didn’t even want to do. My attention span was trash. I kept telling myself I needed to get it together, but nothing stuck. Not habit trackers, not goal lists, not even “deep work” YouTube. Everything collapsed and the second life got overwhelming. I wasn’t lazy. I was living from a story that said, “I’m just not a disciplined person.” Then I read one sentence in Atomic Habits that cracked something open: Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become. That’s when it hit me, my brain wasn’t resisting change. It was protecting an old identity. I decided to psyop myself. And it worked. Here’s how.

This sounds wild but I started studying how the brain filters reality. Cognitive science calls it “predictive processing.” Your brain constantly scans for info that matches what it already believes. It’s called confirmation bias. So if your story is “I suck at follow-through,” your brain literally filters out proof to the contrary. But here’s the glitch, if you feed your brain a new story and back it up with action, it starts scanning for that instead.

I didn’t fake it. I built what I call “identity anchors”, small actions that confirmed the story I wanted to believe.I didn’t say “I’m a beast in the gym.” I just did 10 pushups and logged it.I didn’t say “I’m the next Ryan Holiday.” I just read for 10 minutes a day and underlined quotes.I didn’t say “I’m super productive.” I just started my day with one focused task and stacked from there.

Every action became data. And your brain can’t argue with data.

Here’s what actually worked better than any “productivity hack”:

* Install identity anchors: small actions that match the person you want to be
* Track completions, not streaks, it’s about reps, not perfection
* Create “follow-through proof” from random wins (like finishing a podcast series)
* Prime your brain by scripting your ideal day out loud every morning
* Change your inputs, only consume content from people who live how you want to live
* Use visual cues, make your book/gym gear visible and easy to access
* Design dopamine loops for growth, not distraction (yes, that means deleting TikTok)

These tools rewired how I saw myself. And once the identity flipped, everything got easier.

Some stuff that radically changed my thinking (and life):

Atomic Habits by James Clear: Global bestseller for a reason. This book breaks down behavior change using real neuroscience, not fluff. The identity-based habit model made me realize I was reinforcing the wrong narrative. After this book, I stopped trying to “fix” myself and started proving I already had discipline. Insanely good read.

The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest: If you’ve ever felt stuck and couldn’t explain why, this book will break you open. It’s a deep dive into self-sabotage and how to rebuild your internal belief systems. I felt like she was reading my mind. This is the best book I’ve ever read on emotional discipline.

My (27F) older brother (35M) and my best friend (27F) dated for 2-3 years. In that span of time, they lived together, and he strongly emotionally abused her. I witnessed it - he’d be cruel over little things, calling her a worthless idiot for forgetting to refill their keurig coffee cups, for instance. Towards the end, he started getting physical: shoving her against a wall and screaming in her face, punching holes in the wall, etc.

I was the one she called when they broke up, and I helped her pack up her things & leave in the middle of the night. 

This choice was easy for me because I’ve also had to leave an abusive relationship. I get it. And I haven’t been able to look at him the same ever since. Our family still treats him like nothing happened, but even if only a fraction of what she told me is true, I can’t stand him.

They have been broken up for 3 years now. 

In the next year or two I’ll probably be having a wedding. Her & I are still best friends. She’d likely be one of my bridesmaids, if not my maid of honor. He & I only talk if we’re at a family gathering to avoid the awkward tension. He has a fiance now, and I’d feel so bad for her if she had to see his ex at my wedding.

I’ve been dealing with reactive hypoglycemia for over 10 years. After the accidental discovery of a 7 mm structure in my pancreas, I went through a full battery of tests to rule out insulinoma. Now that it’s been ruled out, I’m looking for advice for the next steps.

My symptoms include **post-meal fatigue, dizziness, irritability, brain fog, and a sense of hunger that feels disproportionate to what I’ve eaten.**

Recently, I’ve had some slight worsening; my blood sugar levels are dipping a bit lower during the day, even when I follow my usual routine. I’ve already gone through a fairly extensive diagnostic process:

**Tests Already Done:**

* **MRI, EUS, and biopsy** – 7mm structure in pancreas, biopsy indecisive (because of my hypos, the usual suspect was insulinoma)
* **72-hour fasting test** – no spontaneous hypoglycemia - no insulinoma
* **Exendin-PET-MRI** – no sign of insulinoma, no increase in size of the tumor, 6 months after the initial MRI scan.
* **Cortisol and ACTH** – normal
* **Chromogranin A** – normal
* **5-Hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test Results:**
   * Fasting glucose was 92 mg/dL, insulin 15.6
   * Glucose peaked at **232 mg/dL** at 1 hour, then crashed to **38 mg/dL** by hour 3
   * Insulin peaked at **495 µU/mL**, still high at 369 µU/mL at hour 2
   * C-peptide was high during hypo (6.5 µg/L), ruling out exogenous insulin
   * HbA1c: 5.2
   * R-HOMA at baseline: 3.5

In six months, another PET-CT is planned.

**My current lifestyle:**

* High-fiber breakfast (chia, oat bran, tahini, soy yogurt, nuts, etc.)
* Mostly low-GI diet
* No alcohol or sugar intake, but I drink coffee
* No medications
* Swim 1-2 times a week

What would you do next? My doctors were really focused on the possible tumor, but they haven’t looked deeper into the insulin/metabolic side of things, yet.",2,1753375055.0,Hypoglycemia,2,1.0,False

Their tale of experiencing a skinwalker. My grandma taught school on the reservation and they lived well off compared to the natives living there. From what I know, there’s a lot of lore surrounding the Navajo Nation. Non-natives (primarily older generations) keeping their experiences and stories left unspoken, especially to those not from the culture.

Forgive me if I’m mistaken in any of this, the culture, ideology, practices, or any other part. I’m just trying to tell the story my family has only spoken to me in whispers about. My grandmother, father, and uncle lived there for a few years and their experience was much different than the Navajo people who have lived there for generations upon generations. I just want to tell their story and get insight as to anyone else who has lived in that community and any other stories some people might be willing to share.

My father and uncle are about 2 years apart in age. They lived in Navajo Mountain in the 1980s. My dad was 10-12 and my uncle younger. As it goes, they were always outside riding bikes with their friends, natives of the reservation. My grandma was recovering from an abusive relationship with their father and wasn’t too concerned with their whereabouts, being it was a small community. There wasn’t much trouble around, nor would they know what real trouble was at that age. Trouble wasn’t the issue to young white boys on a reservation then. Pure terror was.

It was a typical night without any parental supervision. The night was colder than usual, and the night sky was blacker than you could imagine. In such a desolate place, the stars in the sky would light the night. This night was as if the earth had moved to a different dimension, an abyss. The boys raced each other as they did every night, until they were compelled to force their brakes in unison. They simultaneously looked up, each boy’s face melted from carefree, innocent and adolescent to unadulterated horror.

The boys stood motionless, grasping their bikes with every nerve, muscle and strength in their body on the dirt road. To the right of them was a mesa, one they rode by every day. The mesa that paralleled from my family’s home. The mesa that they could see through my father and uncle’s bedroom every night. This mesa would become fear and nightmares to them from this night forward.

At the top of the mesa was a roaring fire. Taller than any bonfire that someone could assemble. Bigger than a group of people could assemble. It raged and was unbelievable, it was almost as tall as the mesa itself. More unbelievable was the pitch black figure seen cavorting around the bonfire. The native boys with my father and uncle informed them that this was not a typical Navajo dance or ritual. Pits began to form in their stomachs.

Friends of my father and uncle turned back around without a word and bolted back to their homes. My father and uncle threw their bikes to the ground and ran across the unpaved road into their home. The two came back in a panic, relaying what they’d seen to my grandmother, but she was unconcerned. A legend of the natives she told them, and shooed them away. They laid awake all night in their shared room. Not saying a word to one another. They forced their curtains as close as possible, too scared to look out the window and see what they shouldn’t have to begin with.

Neither could shake the images burnt into their memory, but the sun managed to rise and peaked through into their room. A sense of release washed over them as the darkness had faded. The boys left their beds and traveled to the kitchen to try a second time to tell my grandmother what they saw that night. They tried to get a handle on what they saw, but it was as if they couldn’t explain it. Again, my grandmother brushed them off. With a coffee and newspaper more important than their story, she told them to climb the mesa and investigate.

The boys wrangled the friends who shared the experience with the night prior as they passed on their bikes. The friends stayed on the dirt road, looking up at the mesa as my father and uncle climbed up to see any evidence of the hell-burning fire they witnessed together. The mesa wasn’t much taller than an average one story house, so the brothers took less than 2 minutes to climb to the top where the nightmare took place. When they got to the top they were hysterical and also relieved. There was no indication a bonfire of that enormity, or even a fire at all had taken place on the mesa they had clearly seen it the night earlier.

They climbed down and told the message to the friends who had also been a part of the shocking scene. Their native friends looked at them in shock, but neither said a word to them. They immediately turned their bikes around and proceeded home. It was never talked about again despite my father and brother asking about it. My grandmother and everyone else in the community refused to talk about it again.

My father is a skeptic. He does not believe in anything paranormal. Aliens, ghosts, mermaids, you name it. But whenever I ask about the skinwalker he saw, he turns pale and white. He gets quiet, jumpy and curt. I had to plead to get the full story out of him and I could see goosebumps and every hair standing up on his arms when he shared his experience.

My grandma took me to Navajo Mountain in 2019 to show me her history and to see how Navajo Natives still live on this reservation today. According to her, not much has changed since living there in the 80s.

I hiked and explored what I could of the reservation, as to not invade or violate any of the Navajo Reservation and its beauty. However, I did feel a change in mood when I visited. My existence felt heavy, as if I wasn’t supposed to be there or if I was invading on territory that wasn’t meant for me. Not caused by any of the community there, but just by my presence being on the land. I will never forget my experience visiting and all that I learned about reservation life. My intention is to hear any other stories from Navajo Mountain residents or talk with some people with similar stories in the Navajo reservation.

I climbed the mesa where the skinwalker my dad and uncle claimed had its ritual. I felt pretty normal until I got to the top and stood in the middle. I felt some darkness creep into me as I stood there. I’ve never been the same since.",2,1753374972.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

I'll also be in Karbala and Najaf, so if anyone has any suggestions that would be great too, although I know about the restaurants in karbala, on Shari3 al sanatir, and Turath etc.

I've been thinking a lot lately about how every object around us carries invisible stories. That chipped coffee mug, the book with dog-eared pages, the jacket hanging in your closet - they're not just stuff, they're memory keepers.

**What got me thinking:** I came across this experiment called ""Significant Objects"" where a $1.49 paperweight sold for $197.50 simply because someone attached a story to it. It made me realize we're surrounded by priceless treasures that others might see as junk, but to us they're irreplaceable.

# So here's my question:

**What's one object in your home that holds a special story?**

Maybe it's:

* A guitar that taught you your first song
* A cookbook stained with your grandmother's handwriting
* A childhood toy that got you through tough times
* Something small that represents a big moment
* An ""ugly"" decoration that means the world to you

**I'm curious:**

* What is it?
* What's its story?
* Why do you keep it?
* Would you ever consider passing it on to someone who might need its magic?

I'll start: I have this terrible-looking ceramic owl my 6-year-old niece made me. It's lopsided, the paint is chipping, and honestly it's pretty hideous. But every time I see it, I remember her saying ""I made this so you won't be lonely when I'm not here."" It's the first thing I see every morning, and it still makes me smile.

**Your turn!** I'd love to hear your stories - I have a feeling we're about to discover some incredible hidden treasures.

**A bit about why I'm asking:** This whole concept of ""stories giving objects value"" has gotten me so fascinated that I'm actually building a platform around it. It's a place where people can trade meaningful items while sharing their stories - basically turning every exchange into a connection between strangers who understand that emotional value matters more than market price.

If you're interested in this idea or have thoughts about it, I'd love to hear them. Still figuring things out, but the core belief is that every object deserves a chance to bring joy to someone new.",1,1753374711.0,Swap_on_now,0,1.0,False

I've started brewing the bag after 52 days of rest. I am used to brewing somewhat lighter-roasted coffees; some of my favorite roasters are Sey, September, Subtext, and Heart. I have never encountered a coffee as lightly roasted as H&S and have been struggling with dialing it in for about a week now.

I use a Pietro Pro, V60, T90 filters. While I typically brew at a grind size of 8, 96C water, and the Lance 121 recipe, with this coffee I've attempted to use off boil water, fine up the grind size to 7, 2-minute immersion bloom, and 2 pours after the bloom instead of 1, with lots of agitation. Whatever I've tried, I can't seem to escape the resulting cup having a sort of wheaty background flavor that permeates everything. At best, I feel like I can slightly pick out the flavors of the coffee, but they are very muted, and overall the cup just lacks much complexity. The profile is clean in the sense that I don't get much muddiness or bitterness, and it is generally quite sweet, but I am missing the brightness I generally expect that keeps the coffee from just being one-note.

My guess is that I am still heavily underextracting this thing, or maybe 50-60 days of rest still isn't enough?! I'd love to hear anyone's advice for brewing ultralights like this. Is that background of wheatiness and slightly muted flavors just inherent to this type of roast, or can I really pull more out of the coffee with further adjustments?",6,1753374564.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

1m88tgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1m88tgn/matcha_fixed_my_social_anxiety_and_inner_critic/,Matcha fixed my Social Anxiety (and inner critic),"Tldr:  The L-theanine/caffeine combo in Matcha turns off my social anxiety and inner critic. Now I can, for the first time in my life, actually enjoy talking with people. And people are responding positively to me.

\--------

I've struggled my whole life with social anxiety due to familial abuse and bullying from my general community.  The PTSD I have sometimes even boarders on paranoia (for understandable reason).

While I've worked on myself for decades now, self-help books and therapy, as well as developing my social and conversational skills. I still always have a hard time with just normal conversations. It is so much work.  I feel like other people can just chat circles around me, while I'm constantly expending so much energy trying to fight back the anxiousness and harsh internalized critic. Y'all know the feeling already, but it's like trying to have a conversation while someone stands over you shoulder telling you all the ways that this person is judging you and everything little thing you are saying and doing wrong, including (ironically) not listening to the person because you can't ""hear"" them over the anxiety/critic racket in your head.

It makes it impossible to enjoy conversations and impossible to truly CONNECT with others, because despite my best efforts to be ""normal"" outwardly, people can tell that I'm not fully present with them.....because, you know, the monkey on my back. It's devastatingly ironic, that my social anxiety is afraid people won't like me, but then it gets in the way of me being likeable.

And it breaks my heart, because deep down I do want to connect with people, but my traumatized brain anatomy won't let it happen.  This has been my curse for my whole life...again, decades at this point.

Enter Matcha.

For a year now I've been working at a tea shop, which is really more like a bar that serves tea (no alcohol). And a big part of our job is to talk with customers and make them feel at home while they enjoy their tea sitting at the bar. For the most part, I have managed to do an OK job of this. But I see my co-workers effortlessly connecting to our customers, and customers loving them, and it makes me feel so ""locked out"" of a whole world that I just don't get to access.  Outside looking in.

But one of the teas we serve is matcha, and so in trying to familiarize myself with our products, I've been trying different teas, including matcha, during my shifts.

Boy. I cannot. emphasize. enough. How much this tea has shifted my brain into a place I NEVER thought I'd be able to experience.  I'm not talking psycheledic or psycho-active or whatever. I'm talking purely mood alteration.   It's like the matcha takes my over-worked, over-active amygdala (anxiety), wraps it in a warm blanket and puts it down for a long over due nap.  And then it takes my inner critic/asshole and shuts it the hell up and puts it on time out.

This has freed up SO MUCH energy and mental space for me.  I now find myself freely chatting with people in a relaxed and engaged way. And I'm genuinely ENJOYNG it.  And it's EFFORTLESS.  This has basically been one of the best brain hacks I've found in my life.

On matcha, I often find myself in a flow state of chatting with people, and a small part of my brain is observing myself like I'm a new person, but really it's just the me that could never be free to just be.  I'll respond to people organically and with ease, making them laugh and lean-in to me with interest. I don't have to force myself to smile....I'm just feeling warm and fuzzy about people in general, and that makes me smile naturally........it's bizarre!  It's got me wondering....is THIS what other people without social PTSD experience normally?

As far as the physio-chemistry of it..... I looked into it, and apparently the L-theanine in the matcha is specifically good at reducing anxiety. And the caffeine in the matcha, while obviously stimulating, is actually tempered by the L-theanine.  For most people, this gives them a steady, sustained energy throughout the day (no spike or crash). And I experience this as well.  But for folks like me, with chronic social anxiety, this combination has been an absolute game changer.

I honestly wanna cry when I think about how much this has set me free. I'm free to be me now, the monkey is off my back. I get to feel like a normal person, like an acceptable part of the community now, instead of some contemptible freak.

I've also experimented with taking L-theanine capsules along with coffee and I'm able to get the same effect, so def seems to be specifically the L-theanine/caffeine combo that ""fixes"" my social trauma brain.

Hope this helps some of you out there!",6,1753373966.0,socialanxiety,3,0.88,False
