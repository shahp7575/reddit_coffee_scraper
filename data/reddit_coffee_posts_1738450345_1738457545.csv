I‚Äôve always felt like I was an old soul, someone who was drawn to the quieter, deeper side of life. As I‚Äôve gotten older the less things or people I‚Äôm around the happier I seem to be. The only downside of that is I miss simple connections. 

I crave deep connections/conversations that not many people can even handle, which is fair sometimes but others times I wonder what our skill sets would be if we didn‚Äôt have the ability to communicate through social media or messaging apps. Would it be better? Would we learn more about people? 


Don‚Äôt get me wrong I am one definitely that has failed to do so in the past talking to new people but when I do find someone I click with I want to find out ALL about them. What was it like growing up, hardest lesson(s) they‚Äôve ever had to go through, I want to know more than just ‚Äúwhat do you do for fun‚Äù ? 

FYI, my pet peeve is that question. Which leads me into you learning a little about me:

Reasoning behind that pet peeve as a question is that it what I do for fun can be ever changing. It can change from the friends I‚Äôm with, to the seasons. It‚Äôs such a loaded question that can be broken down into many, many more questions but we don‚Äôt take the time to do so. 

So now that you know a pet peeve here are a few other things that may or may not interest you. 

I love the outdoors, eventually one day I will live in the mountains and hopefully drank my coffee on the porch every morning as the sun rises. I enjoy hiking and camping, I‚Äôd rather cook then to ever eat out again even though I‚Äôve had some amazing food. I dream of owning a farm, growing my food and living simple. I haven‚Äôt made the best decisions in the past but I‚Äôm learning each and every day. 

Hopefully this message finds you well and if I‚Äôve made an impression I‚Äôd love to learn more about you! If not, I hope this post finds you well. ",1,1738457166.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

If you can handle my dry humor, enjoy spontaneous adventures, and you don‚Äôt mind me making fun of you in the sweetest way possible, we might just be a match made in Reddit heaven. Bonus points if you can teach me how to actually use the kitchen without setting off the smoke alarm.

1ifkzlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ifkzlg/my_wife_has_ptsd_feel_like_her_anxiety_and_anger/,"My wife has PTSD, feel like her anxiety and anger will be the end of us","Don't even know where to start, so sorry if I drift apart to certain details as this is really not a specific event but a story of 5 years. Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

My wife and I have (both in our early thirties) been married for 5 years, we have 2 absolutely amazing kids (preschoolers), we are both highly educated, have our passions, we both do okay financially. We could be a poster upper middle class family if it weren't for our relationship.

When we met one of the best things about my wife (or so I thought) was how she seemed to be always on top of things, very oriented towards results, very hands on on everything, never shy of responsibility. She truly seemed like a strong, independent woman and that is what I loved about her.

Once we started living together and got married, I started experiencing a ridiculous amount of passive-aggression. I did see some red flags, like for example she was of the opinion that she doesn't have a need to talk with other people about her personal pains or even lives because ""nobody has had the same experience so nobody can relate"". Radical as she was with such stances, I just took it as a more negative aspect of her tendency to take responsibility for stuff and do it really well. However, very quickly it became quite ridiculous. Then there was another red flag when it come to sexual aspect, don't want to get it into details but long story short she openly told me that for her sex isn't really about her or women in general. Once again, this wasn't just an ""i feel"", ""i think"" - she had a fairly strong opinion about that.

So there really were red flags but again, my philosophy in life in general is good comes with bad, bad comes with good.

But her passive-aggressiveness very quickly became extremely out of hand and frankly very often I couldn't even understand the reason behind it. Here's an illustration of an actual dialogue without absolutely any exaggeration:

\- hey, how's the morning going?  
\- the usual, kids did that and that <..> but what's wrong with you?  
\- what? why? I'm not angry at all, I am in fact actually pretty cheerful.  
\- so what's with the tone?  
\- what tone? I just haven't had my coffee yet.  
\- yeah I don't know.

And that's it. This means a few hours of silent treatment at least. If I called her out in situations like that - it would turn into a huge huge argument where her logic would always follow the same pattern:

She feels tension therefore it is my fault for creating it, therefore her anger is justified. She would absolutely ALWAYS assume that I had a motive to literally hurt her. If I disagree with her and it makes her angry - I made her angry on purpose. If I make a joke and she feels hurt - I wanted to make her hurt. If she mishears something that I say - she refuses to believe me.

In essence she had huge trust issues which manifested in a strange way - she would interpret how I actually feel, what I think, what I mean and would absolutely never accept when I tell her how I feel or what I think. Like in the instance above - even if I tell her, she doesn't believe it, even if she doesn't fight it.

A good year into our marriage I noticed that her mother does the exact same thing. And after many times of pointing it out, she eventually recognised when her mother acted this way towards her. Again the situation was ridiculous - her mother visited us and cooked us dinner while we were out with my wife. Once we came back and so it, my wife told her (in a really friendly voice): ""oh I'm sorry but we actually had dinner already in a restaurant"". And her mother immediately became resentful. Note that her mother came specifically to watch our kid for like a few hours so we could go out on a date. And then got angry that our date included... a restaurant :)

However, this was a double-edged sword. The more she became self-aware, the more those situations would trigger her feelings of ""tension"", the more it was... my fault. While we started having conflicts that were not only of passive type - actually talking, they would often end up with her going over the line and screaming at me like ""I was the worst thing that happened to her in her life"" or ""that I ruined her life"", or that I am a narcissist. These things were extremely hurtful, expressed perhaps not so much with anger as with absolute rage. Like one point during an argument I told her how am I such a bad person when I can admit when I do something wrong and I always talk about both of our flaws but you only blame me and never say anything positive at all. So she started a rant that started with her saying what I good father I am and finished (without my interruption) with the conclusion that she needs to divorce me to protect our kids from me. I want to emphasise that this is the same trail of thought.

My life was basically hell and every time I would get some hope once she noticed something toxic about her behaviour - it would be followed by an increased rage. She couldn't say she's sorry no matter what she said. It took me about 3 years to sort of ""teach her"" that telling me ""I'm sorry for how you feel"" and telling me ""I'm sorry for what I've done"" are not the same. She would tell me it's the same and as a consequence we went probably about 3 years of marriage without her apologising for anything. EVER. This included things like ""I find men who cry disgusting"", even throwing things at me once. Not a single apology. EVER. And if would lose it which did happen and apologised to her - she would never meet me halfway either, rather she would use the opportunity to add even more bad stuff about me.

Note that I was the single provider and worked around 60 hours a week an extremely mentally demanding job, there were cases where I worked for 36 hours straight with like 40 minute sleeping breaks (rare, but happened). And I would still try to take the kids at least once a week off her hands, I would most of the time be the one that puts them to bed etc etc. She would constantly tell me that she is the only one taking care of all of us and that I am not ""pulling my weight"". If she was out of hand and incapable of saying sorry, another thing is that she was also incapable of saying thank you.

Over the years I convinced her to be less critical of her parents who actually always supported as much as they could but her perception was that they are extremely terrible people. She started talking with them more, got more involved with their lives. She did have good reasons to be resentful and they all included situations where she didn't receive empathy from her parents but it's not like her parents were neglectful. Different generation, different values. They simply never ever talked in their family about their feelings. Never. Not talking apparently was their family brand. They all treated each other that way. She was basically doing to me what she considered the biggest injustice to her. I started pointing the ways they showed love and care (and they really did ALWAYS try to help with anything they could that was hands on). Their relationship changed. For the first time ever she was able to talk with them without the same resentment I would always see from her. I felt like this was a good thing. She admitted it as much. Never said thank you or showed any kind of gratitude. Despite hundreds of hours of trying to convince her that her father just being a clueless joe is not equivalent of her father trying to hurt her or that her mother not being able to respond meaningfully towards deeper questions is not equivalent of ""not caring"".

Anyway, I was up for another surprise. At some point she told me she was sexually abused in her teenage years. I immediately told her that something like that always leaves an impact and it is most definitely not a case of ""I have dealt with it myself perfectly and its just history"". She didn't like that and took it as a personal attack. Again many months passed and she finally went to therapy. As she later explained - she didn't go there because of any issues or the things we discussed, she went there for help with a strategy on how to leave me :) Even though she specifically asked me to find her one as I had friends in that industry based on who I believe would be the best fit.

To summarise, at this point here are some of the basic things she considers absolute truths, according to her own admission:  
\- if she feels hurt, it means I do not love her because if I loved her, she would NEVER feel hurt.  
\- if she feels tension, it means I did something wrong.  
\- not talking for 2 days if a husband took 15 minutes to take out the trash is not passive-aggressiveness, it's what all the normal people do and I am probably clinically insane if I even dare to question the normalcy of such behaviour  
\- if I tell her that she is a good mother or a good person or that I love her during or after an argument, it doesn't count because I only want appease her since us being in the argument means that I was violent towards her  
\- our sexual intimacy is poor because I destroyed her self-confidence in the beginning of the relationship by pointing out that ""something feels weird"" and talking about my past experiences (stupid on my part though it was out of desperation) not telling her enough compliments (which is true), and ""pushing her"" by saying that sex is about the pleasure of both men and women.

A breakthrough was reached eventually when she started psychotherapy. She started crying more instead of being in an all consuming rage. While it helped, I was already living on borrowed time emotionally. Eventually she heard a diagnosis: PTSD. She recovered most of memories of that instance of rape during her teenage years. I tried my best being supportive, sometimes more, sometimes less successful. She finally admitted a few times that she realised that her behaviour was less than adequate.

Basically right now everything would be manageable. She still gets triggered for reasons most people do not but at least she stopped putting it all on me, she stopped inferring my supposed motives to hurt her, she tries to calm down etc. She just started EMDR therapy.

The problem?

I have so much resentment for her. And while I want to be supportive of her, I have constant thoughts of divorce, if 5 years ago I was able to remain absolutely calm even during her huge rage fits, today her angry face makes me tense or angry myself, it takes like 15 minutes to calm myself down. I sometimes explode when faced with these situations that we now know stems from her past trauma. She is an extremely good mother (weirdly she never showcases the kind of behaviour that she always showed towards the rest of her family, including me - that always gave me hope), she is working on it, it is day and night when compared to how life was even 3 years ago.

However, I seem to be unable to forgive her for the way she treated me. And every time she still gets angry or tensed, is a reminder of that. I know it is unfair to her. But dear god how it is unfair to me too... I feel like after years and years of constant and vicious abuse, I now have to be rock for my abuser. Rationally I understand that it is more complicated than that. But emotionally I am all spent. I am totally out. I feel like a fucking shell of my former self, as that quote from LOTR - like butter spread over too much bread.

I can't demand empathy from her, I can't demand her to start thinking about the abuse I encountered although it is painfully obvious to me that while she now understands what's going on - she is still oblivious to the amount of damage it has done to me. And yet I am fully aware that she is in an even worse situation. But it doesn't help. It's like my body is screaming, demanding for a safe space, for a place where I don't need to endure for others, where I can recharge, where there is also place for my feelings, for my needs, where I can simply wake up and go to sleep in peace and quiet. I don't even think that I yearn for emotional intimacy or connection from another human being. It's like my very soul is demanding to be left alone, to let it heal its own wounds. And I don't know what frightens me more. The fact that I can't leave. Or the fact that I can leave.

Sorry if this was unintelligible or confusing. Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons. Thank each and every one of you who have given me your precious time. I just started crying... but I guess that is always the point in cases like that. Sexual abuse is a terrible thing. I doesn't destroy people. It destroy's entire families.",3,1738456847.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

I love to bake so I decided to make it and asked my boyfriend his favorite flavors. He told me he really liked banana and wanted a vanilla custard in the middle. 

Although I love to bake, I am a bit tight on time and finances so I did the pudding mix (banana flavor) in the store bought cake (yellow vanilla) trick. I also bought store bought icing. So day 1 I made the cake and put them in the fridge. Success. Day 2 I made the custard. A little iffy, had to watch a YouTube video, but‚Ä¶success. Day 3 I assembled the cake by cutting the 2 rounds in half. It took maybe 30 minutes to describe how I would cut these to my partner who could not fathom a ‚Äúhalf moon‚Äù shaped cake‚Äù and didn‚Äôt understand my half ass attempt of describing it (not accurately I know) as ‚Äúpeanut butter and jelly the looooooong way.‚Äù So I cut the rounds in half, added the custard, layered cake, custard, etc. and popped that into the freezer because I have seen them do that on food network. Who am I to argue with Bobby Flay on Diners Drive ins and Dives. After 5 minutes, because I am impatient and it was literally -6 degrees ferengeungt last week, I take that bitch out and ice it with my custom pillsbury icing. It‚Äôs barely covered like a hooker on a Tuesday night. This naked whore needs a coat before company comes over. 

It‚Äôs day 4 now and I‚Äôm looking at this lil naked baby in the fridge thinking it just needs a lil sum sum so I‚Äôll whip up a butter cream with the sticks in the freezer. The heater is blasting and I need to clean some dishes before we leave for our big expensive bday dinner so I pop all 4 (half sticks) on the heater vent to cook while I clean. The cats look the sticks of butter as if they knew that was a mistake. 

So I knew butter on 80¬∞F blowing air would lead to a melted mess so I took mental note to grab them in a minute. However, my OCD kicked in and I needed to clean the sink, the crockpot and pans before our guests arrived tonight. So about an hour later the crockpot is shining, the pans are clean, so is the stove top and coffee maker!! And welll‚Ä¶ the butter is still on the vent. I ran over to them in a panic and saw the yellowy juices seeping into the fake wood vent cover deep into the floor boards. 3 out of 4 butters were completely liquified and I threw them away. One stick was only partially responsible for my crushing dread.

An hour until dinner reservations and my partner at this point is showering and listening to the United States downfall on max volume upstairs. I FaceTime my mom in shame and admit my defeat against the butter battle. I strapped paper towels to the end of a mop and soaked up all the butter I could but I still see the greasy glistening from the depths of my air ducts. We have since gone to dinner. I fear (or hope?) the house smells like butter when we get back. 

Our guests do not know what is about to strike their nostrils. I still haven‚Äôt made the buttercream. 

TLDR; I put 4 half sticks of butter on my heater vent, forgot about them, and ended up with an air duct full of melted butter.",1,1738456737.0,tifu,3,0.55,False

*The following report was released by Fr. Dionysios Tampakis, and is dated 22 January 2018. It was told to him by Abbess Arsenia of the Monastery of Christ of the Forest on the island of Paros, where the tomb of Saint Arsenios of Paros and the center of his veneration is located.*

A few minutes ago, Abbess Arsenia Tsantouli (Abbess of the Monastery where Saint Arsenios of Paros lived in asceticism) and the Nuns related to us the following astonishing miracle:

For many years the sister of Abbess Arsenia lived in Belgium, where she had a family, and her granddaughter was made worthy five months ago to become a mother.

The baby girl was baptized this year, 2018, on the feast of Theophany and received the name Arsenia in honor of the Venerable Arsenios.

However, the baby got sick suddenly and they took her to the hospital with dyspnea.

After two days, January 8th 2018, the baby unfortunately departed this life, leaving her parents inconsolable.

That very day, a Greek doctor, who was in that very hospital, was making his rounds, and received as a visitor an old man with a cane, to whom he told that the baby was dead. The old man told him to go and perform chest compressions and resuscitation, even though 24 hours had passed since her death was confirmed by science, and he further said that the child would live.

The doctor was impressed by this so he did by the letter what the old man said, and the baby Arsenia, to the glory of God, returned to life.

As the mother returned to the hospital in order to prepare for the funeral, she found her baby girl alive in her bed.

The old man who spoke to the doctor was Saint Arsenios himself, as he appears in his icon.

""God is wondrous among His Saints!""

The Holy Monastery of Christ of the Forest - Saint Arsenios of Paros

*Number 2:*

A woman named Helen Davaria, who lived in Paroikia, often went up to the Monastery and performed various tasks for the sisters of the Monastery. One day the Venerable Arsenios said to her:

""Child, here you come and work, what do the sisters give you for your labor? Do they pay you?""

""No, they don't give me money because they don't have any, but they give me bread, coffee, sugar and other things.""

""From these things that they give you, do you give to some poor person, when he asks you or you when you happen to meet someone on the road?""

""No, Elder, they do not ask from me because they know that I am poor, but I have not met anyone on the road who asks from me either.""

""Listen, child, if you want Christ to bless you and the little food that they give you, when you meet a poor and hungry person and he asks you to give to him, likewise when you know someone who is poor and in need or a widow or orphan who is hungry, do not expect them to ask you. Give with joy and do not be afraid, but believe that Christ will invisibly bless your little possessions and you will not go hungry, nor will you lack until the end of your life.""

""Gladly, Elder, in what you told me, I will obey you.""

She made a prostration and left the Monastery, having with her 8 loaves of bread that they had given her. As soon as she had gone 500 meters from the Monastery, she met the elder Demetrios Maounin, who asked her for a little bread, because he had not eaten since the previous day. Helen immediately took a loaf of bread from her bag and gave it to him with great enthusiasm. When she had gone another 500 meters, she saw a fisherman's wife gathering wild greens, since her husband had 4 days to catch fish, as Helen learned after asking her. Then, she took out of her bag and gave her 2 loaves of bread. When she arrived at Paroikia, she saw a 4-year-old child crying, because he was hungry and his mother had no bread to give him. She also saw the child's mother standing inside the door of her house with her hands crossed, praying and crying. Then she took a loaf of bread and gave it to the child. Helen, having arrived at her house, took out the things from her bag and saw that the loaves, instead of being 4, had not decreased, but there were 8 left. Marveling at the event, she immediately returned to the Monastery, moved and tearful, fell on her knees at the feet of the Saint and recounted the miracle, thanking God and the Saint.

*Number 3:*

Apostolos Makrakis, being in Paros, went to the Monastery of the Transfiguration, in order to meet Father Arsenios and to confess. He began to confess, but instead of confessing his sins with humility and contrition of heart, he began to recount his accomplishments and that he rebukes sinners and especially the hierarchs, priests, and rulers and publishes their sins with joy. Father Arsenios gently said to him:

""Listen, child. You must know that in confession people confess their sins and not their achievements. It is good and pleasing to God to preach, but to preach with humility and not with pride. However, to examine and publish the sins of others, this not only does not build up, but also undermines and causes harm to yourself and your listeners. Take care of yourself and if you want to benefit and be benefited, see your own sins and not those of others. Do not judge, so that you will not be judged. Who are you to judge another's household? Pray with humility, and do some prostrations.""

""Prostrations are for the monks. I have a higher and loftier work, the word of God and to rebuke and condemn sinners.""

""You should humble yourself and obey, so that the Lord does not humble you, for He opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Know that a knee that does not bend will be broken.""

And indeed, after leaving the Monastery, Makrakis, sitting on a bench, as soon as he had gone a few meters from the Monastery, fell and broke his leg, according to the Saint‚Äôs prediction. But he neither came to his senses nor went to the doctors; suffering from gangrene, they cut off his leg from the thigh and he remained lame.

At the time when Makrakis was leaving the Monastery, Father Arsenios said to some present: ""Know that this man suffers from Luciferian pride, he will fall into error and cause schism and harm to the Church.""

*Number 4:*

At one time the Saint was moving from the Monastery of Saint George to the Monastery of the Transfiguration. Passing through Lagada, outside the farmhouse of the elder Niketas Haniotos, upon seeing Father Arsenios, he ran to kiss his right hand and said to him:

""Elder, I had arranged to send to the Monastery of Christ 21/2 oka of oil for the lamps of the temple. Is it possible since you are going there for me to bottle it by the thousand grams, place it for safety in a basket and hitch it to an animal? It has no weight.'


""Thank you, elder Niketa, let me take it. Bring it, I'm waiting.""

When elder Niketas came to his house, he was informed that the children accidentally broke the bottle, and he had no other. He started shouting and arguing with his children. Hearing the voices, the Saint came down from his animal and went toward elder Niketas, where he learned the reason and said to him: ""Don't be sad, I have room on my animal. It hangs empty. Bring it there to empty it and I will surely drop it off at the Monastery."" Indeed, the elder Niketas went and the Saint showed him an empty basket and said to him: ""Empty it there. Yes, I am serious, empty it there and do not be afraid, just believe that the oil will not be lost, but will surely reach where you have arranged it.""

Elder Niketas believed, let go the oil in the basket and not a single drop of oil was leaking out, neither at that moment, nor during the entire journey, but it arrived at the Monastery safely, to the surprise and admiration of all the nuns who saw it.

*Numbers 2, 3 and 4 from Archimandrite Philotheos Zervakos*

*Number 5:*

A certain girl from Syros came to the Convent of the Transfiguration to visit her sister, who was a nun. The nun had previously been informed that her sister had fallen into a serious sin. When she learned that the girl was outside the doors of the convent, the nun screamed at her, ""Go far away from here. Since you are defiled, you will defile the convent and the nuns."" Instead of feeling pity for her sister, and trying to lead her to repentance, the nun and some of the other nuns struck the poor girl and told her to go away.

The wretched girl cried, ""I have made a mistake. Forgive me!""

The nun shrieked, ""Go away, or I will kill you to wash away the shame you have brought to our family.""

""Have you no pity, my sister, don't you share my pain?""

""No,"" the nun shouted, ""you are not my sister, you are a foul harlot.""

""Where shall I go?"" she sobbed.

""Go and drown yourself,"" was the heartless reply.

The poor girl fled from the convent, bleeding and wounded, intending to kill herself. At that very moment, St Arsenios was on his way to visit the convent. Seeing the girl in such a state, he asked her what was wrong. She explained that she had been led astray by corrupt men and women. Realizing her sin, she went to the convent to ask her sister for help

""See what they have done to me, Elder. What do you advise me to do? Shall I drown myself, or leap off a cliff?""

""I do not advise you to do either, my child. If you wish, I shall take you with me and heal the wounds of your soul and body,"" he said gently.

""Where will you take me?"" the miserable girl asked.

""To the convent, my child.""

""I beg you not to take me there, Elder. My sister and the other nuns said they would kill me if I came back.""

The saint replied, ""Do not be afraid. They will not kill you, because I shall entrust you to Christ, and no one will be able to harm you.""

""Very well,"" she said, ""If you entrust me to Christ I will not be afraid of them, for Christ is more powerful than they.""

St Arsenios led her to the convent, consoling her and encouraging her to repentance and confession. After hearing her confession, he made her a nun. Then he called all the nuns into the church and severely rebuked those who wounded the girl. He reminded them of the parable of the Prodigal Son, and of how Christ had come to save sinners. He often associated with sinners, showing them great love and mercy.

""You, however, have done the opposite. Though you knew that her soul had been wounded by the devil, you did not feel sorry for her. You did not embrace her and try to save her from further sin, but you attacked her and beat her. Then you urged her to kill herself. Now I, your Spiritual Father, tell you that you are not nuns, you are not Christians, you are not even human beings. You are devoid of compassion, affection, and sympathy. You are murderesses! Therefore, I forbid you to receive Holy Communion for three years, unless you recognize your sin. Repent and confess, weep and ask forgiveness from God and from me, your Spiritual Father, and from the other nuns who did not participate in your sinful behavior.""

The nuns began to weep bitterly and they repented. Thus, he lessened their penance and forgave them. He gave the girl's sister the penance of not receiving Holy Communion for a whole year. Because the other nuns had shared in this sin, he would not permit them to receive Communion for six months.

*The following report was released by Fr. Dionysios Tampakis, and is dated 22 January 2018. It was told to him by Abbess Arsenia of the Monastery of Christ of the Forest on the island of Paros, where the tomb of Saint Arsenios of Paros and the center of his veneration is located.*

A few minutes ago, Abbess Arsenia Tsantouli (Abbess of the Monastery where Saint Arsenios of Paros lived in asceticism) and the Nuns related to us the following astonishing miracle:

For many years the sister of Abbess Arsenia lived in Belgium, where she had a family, and her granddaughter was made worthy five months ago to become a mother.

The baby girl was baptized this year, 2018, on the feast of Theophany and received the name Arsenia in honor of the Venerable Arsenios.

However, the baby got sick suddenly and they took her to the hospital with dyspnea.

After two days, January 8th 2018, the baby unfortunately departed this life, leaving her parents inconsolable.

That very day, a Greek doctor, who was in that very hospital, was making his rounds, and received as a visitor an old man with a cane, to whom he told that the baby was dead. The old man told him to go and perform chest compressions and resuscitation, even though 24 hours had passed since her death was confirmed by science, and he further said that the child would live.

The doctor was impressed by this so he did by the letter what the old man said, and the baby Arsenia, to the glory of God, returned to life.

As the mother returned to the hospital in order to prepare for the funeral, she found her baby girl alive in her bed.

The old man who spoke to the doctor was Saint Arsenios himself, as he appears in his icon.

""God is wondrous among His Saints!""

The Holy Monastery of Christ of the Forest - Saint Arsenios of Paros

*Number 2:*

A woman named Helen Davaria, who lived in Paroikia, often went up to the Monastery and performed various tasks for the sisters of the Monastery. One day the Venerable Arsenios said to her:

""Child, here you come and work, what do the sisters give you for your labor? Do they pay you?""

""No, they don't give me money because they don't have any, but they give me bread, coffee, sugar and other things.""

""From these things that they give you, do you give to some poor person, when he asks you or you when you happen to meet someone on the road?""

""No, Elder, they do not ask from me because they know that I am poor, but I have not met anyone on the road who asks from me either.""

""Listen, child, if you want Christ to bless you and the little food that they give you, when you meet a poor and hungry person and he asks you to give to him, likewise when you know someone who is poor and in need or a widow or orphan who is hungry, do not expect them to ask you. Give with joy and do not be afraid, but believe that Christ will invisibly bless your little possessions and you will not go hungry, nor will you lack until the end of your life.""

""Gladly, Elder, in what you told me, I will obey you.""

She made a prostration and left the Monastery, having with her 8 loaves of bread that they had given her.

I would love to be your friend!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm BlueExodia0. I'm trying to remember back as to why I decided to choose this username, but I guess it was thought of out of boredom lol... Imagine if this was my real name.¬† I'm sure would be super annoying to write out on exams over and over and the teachers would have gotten a heart attack. At least people wouldn't butcher it like how they tend to do with my real name. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one friend that will join us on our journey through life - someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had difficult luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

1ifkov0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ifkov0/rf_the_last_goodbye/,[RF] The Last Goodbye,"She smoothed down her dress and straightened her jacket, contemplating how she looked as she stood in front of the door. Doubt swelled in her chest. Was this a good idea?

How would she be received? Would there be anger? Emptiness? Would the door be shut in her face, or worse‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwould no one be home? Or was there still a small chance of warmth? A welcome?

A thousand different scenarios played through her mind.

She lifted her hand, hesitated, then took a deep breath and knocked against the wood with uncertainty. It was light at first, barely audible. A pause. Suspense.

*What the hell.*

She knocked again, firmer this time.

She glanced over her shoulder at the neighborhood. Dusk had settled, casting long shadows over cracked pavement and neglected yards. The street had changed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor maybe she had. It had been so long since she had been back in the States. Too long.

She had heard stories. Neighborhoods like this, once family-friendly, had become desperate places. People did whatever they had to do to survive. Was it safe for her to be here?

This house was one of many on the block, but she no longer recognized them. The town itself felt distant, its landmarks vague in her memory‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust blurry edges of a life she once knew.

Then‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe sound of the lock turning.

Her head whipped forward, breath catching.

The door creaked open.

It was him.

Her heart sank. Her eyes widened. What the hell did she just do? Why did she come here?

He stood in the doorway, staring at her, his expression unreadable. His face was blank, but she could see the gears turning behind his eyes. Processing.

She didn‚Äôt know what to say‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven though she had rehearsed this moment thousands of times. Each time slightly different.

She licked her lips, inhaled sharply, and let out a faint, ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

Nothing.

She studied him, taking in every detail. He had aged. Of course, she had too, but he looked‚Ä¶ different.

He was disheveled. Mismatched clothes‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa robe thrown over pajama pants, a faded t-shirt clinging to a thicker frame. His once-dark, lush hair had grayed. His face was colder now, more rigid, worn with time.

And still‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe said nothing.

Then, a flicker. His eyes softened just slightly.

He looked down, deep in thought, then glanced past her‚Ää‚Äî‚Äächecking for something. The street? The neighbors? A way out of this moment?

Finally, he stepped back, nodding toward the open doorway.

A silent invitation.

She nodded, lowering her gaze as she stepped inside.

Immediately, she took in her surroundings. A small, cramped living room. A tiny kitchen on her left. To the right, an old sofa sat across from a coffee table cluttered with a flat-screen TV, a gaming console, a tangled mess of cords. A controller and headset lay abandoned.

He had been playing before she arrived. She had interrupted something.

The silence between them was unbearable. She hated silence.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to bother you so late,‚Äù she blurted, her voice unsure. ‚ÄúI just wanted to see you. To stop by.‚Äù

She hesitated, awkward, uncertain.

She stood near the sofa, looking back at him as he lingered by the kitchen counter. He ran a hand through his hair‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa nervous habit? Or just a way to keep his hands busy?

Finally, he spoke.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù

His voice was deeper, rougher than she remembered.

She swallowed hard, trying not to tear up. Don‚Äôt cry.

She inhaled sharply, then spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the area, like I told you earlier. I‚Äôm actually staying in the city.‚Äù

She hesitated.

‚ÄúA colleague and I were having dinner, and I knew you were here, so I wanted to see you.‚Äù Her voice wavered. ‚ÄúTo see how you were.‚Äù

His expression hardened. He furrowed his brow.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù His words were clipped. Then‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsharper this time: ‚ÄúWhat about you? What are you doing here? Why are you back?‚Äù

She exhaled.

‚ÄúSweden sent me.‚Äù The words felt strange in her mouth. ‚ÄúI work for them now. They thought I should come back to the States. I help businesses‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämake sure they‚Äôre viable, sustainable. Support the economy. Make sure the right funds go to the right places.‚Äù

She shifted her weight. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm staying in the city, but we came out here today to‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äù she hesitated, searching for the right words. ‚ÄúTo prepare. To see who we‚Äôd be talking to.‚Äù

He acknowledged her words with a slow nod, but there was something sharp behind it.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúSweden, huh?‚Äù

His tone was cold, almost accusing.

‚ÄúI figured you would have stayed.‚Äù

The words stung.

She swallowed. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she answered softly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working with them for ten years. Helping Americans seek asylum. Figuring out ways to make it sustainable.‚Äù

She felt so awkward.

‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù she asked, forcing herself to meet his gaze.

He took a deep breath‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthen exhaled hard.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, voice laced with something bitter. ‚ÄúI lost the business. Lost the house.‚Äù

His jaw clenched. ‚ÄúNow I live here. With two roommates. Just trying to survive.‚Äù

His words cut deep.

She had made a mistake coming here.

The guilt settled heavy in her chest.

She suddenly felt like an intruder in his life.

She started to turn toward the door, her vision blurring.

Maybe she should go.

Maybe she shouldn‚Äôt have come at all.

She started to feel like she had overstayed her welcome. The coldness of his words, the silence between them‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was all too much.

Her vision blurred as tears swelled at the corners of her eyes. She turned slightly toward the door, inhaling sharply, trying to steady herself. Don‚Äôt cry. Don‚Äôt cry.

She didn‚Äôt look at him directly as she spoke. ‚ÄúMaybe I should go. I‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôm so sorry, I‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äù

The words caught in her throat, unfinished. She didn‚Äôt know what else to say.

Before she could take a step toward the door, he grabbed her arm.

Then, he pulled her into him.

His arms wrapped around her tightly, desperately. She stiffened for a moment, caught off guard, but then‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääshe melted into the embrace.

The tears came fast, unstoppable. She sobbed into his chest, gripping him like he was the only thing tethering her to the earth.

Then she felt it‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähis own tears.

Warm and silent, they fell against the side of her face.

She had forgotten what it was like to have him tower over her, to feel so small in his arms. Here, in this moment, they clung to each other like two people drowning, desperate to keep from slipping beneath the surface.

She inhaled deeply, taking in his scent‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfamiliar, distant, overwhelming. It stirred something deep inside her, something she had long buried.

Out of the corner of her eye, she caught a glimpse of movement.

The door beside the couch had opened slightly.

Someone‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa vague figure in the dim light‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpeered out, watching.

Then, just as quickly, the door shut.

She and him remained locked in place, arms wrapped around one another, standing in the middle of the tiny living room as if time itself had stopped.

It could have been seconds.

Minutes.

Hours.

Neither of them moved.

Finally, they pulled away.

She wiped at her face, suddenly self-conscious, feeling the heat of her tears still burning her cheeks. Her eyes were swollen, red. She didn‚Äôt care.

She looked at him. He was the same.

No longer was she concerned about how she looked in his eyes.

His own face was streaked with tears, raw with emotion. Vulnerable.

His voice came hoarse, shaky. ‚ÄúI love you. I never stopped loving you.‚Äù

Her breath caught in her throat.

She swallowed hard, choking back the wave of emotion as she whispered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always loved you.‚Äù

He exhaled sharply, nodding, as if trying to steady himself.

Then, he cleared his throat, moving his hands from her shoulders, trailing them down her arms until they found hers. His grip was firm‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägrounding.

He held onto her hands for a lingering moment before clearing his throat again and slightly turning.

‚ÄúDo you want a glass of water?‚Äù he asked.

She nodded, voice still caught somewhere in her chest.

He turned, took a couple of steps toward the kitchen, and pulled open a cupboard. Two clear glasses clinked together as he set them on the counter.

He opened the fridge and took out a container of water. She watched him, noting the way he handled it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa bit awkward, like a man out of practice with hosting company.

She assumed it was filtered water. With the contamination in the ground, what else could it be?

The water poured slowly into the glasses, the sound unusually loud in the quiet room.

She didn‚Äôt know why, but it felt significant.

He put the container back in the fridge, picked up the glasses, and handed one to her.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúSit.‚Äù

He walked ahead of her, pushing the controller and headset aside on the coffee table, clearing space for her.

She lowered herself onto the sofa.

It was soft. Too soft.

She felt almost swallowed by it.

He moved around the coffee table, sitting down on the other side. The sofa wasn‚Äôt large, but not quite a loveseat either. There was still space between them, a small gap that felt wider than it should.

He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees, legs wide apart. His hands clasped together, his head tilted down.

Out of the corner of his eye‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe looked at her.

‚ÄúYou look great,‚Äù he said, his voice quieter now, almost thoughtful. ‚ÄúYou look really well.‚Äù

She scoffed, shaking her head. ‚ÄúSo do you.‚Äù

He let out a short laugh, rubbing his face with his left hand, then pushing his hair out of his eyes before settling back into his previous position. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm old,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúAnd I look like shit.‚Äù

They both laughed at that, but it was a hollow sound‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätired, laced with something unspoken.

As he shifted, the sleeve of his robe slipped slightly, exposing his wrist. A scar.

Her eyes caught on it immediately‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa long, pale mark along his right arm. She didn‚Äôt say anything, but she knew what it was from.

After she had left, citizens were implanted with chips‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätracking devices that held all currency, identification, and data. Physical money and paper identification became void. It had been the government‚Äôs way of controlling movement, cutting down on defectors, ensuring no one could just disappear.

He noticed her staring.

Slowly, he ran his left thumb over the scar, rubbing it absentmindedly.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said, voice flat. ‚ÄúWhen the government fell, I didn‚Äôt let them remove it.‚Äù He exhaled through his nose. ‚ÄúI cut it out myself.‚Äù

A shiver ran through her, though she kept her expression neutral.

She didn‚Äôt say much in response, just a soft, ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

They sat in silence.

She lifted her glass and took another sip. The water tasted off. Not bad‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust different. Filtered, hopefully.

She had heard about the contamination‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe corporations that dumped chemicals into the ground after regulations were repealed, not caring about the long-term effects. Some places would take years, decades, to recover. Some never would. No one was allowed to live in the worst of those zones.

The silence stretched between them.

Finally, he broke it.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he said, glancing at her. ‚ÄúWorking for Sweden, huh?‚Äù

She nodded, acknowledging it.

‚ÄúYeah. It took a couple of years for me to find the right job, but with my degree, they saw I had skills to offer. And‚Ä¶ here I am.‚Äù

He was quiet for a beat, then asked, ‚ÄúWhat exactly again?‚Äù

She hesitated. ‚ÄúI help businesses rebuild. Make sure funding goes to the right places, ensure sustainability. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ meant to help stabilize everything.‚Äù

He nodded slowly.

He exhaled, rubbing his hands together before leaning forward. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a maintenance guy now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI clean things. Fix things.‚Äù

She studied him.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she started carefully, ‚ÄúSweden is looking for people with your skill set to help rebuild.‚Äù

He cut her off before she could finish.

‚ÄúYeah. No.‚Äù His voice was sharp, definitive. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not too sure about that.‚Äù

She fell silent, looking down. Had she overstepped?

She wasn‚Äôt sure if she had offended him or if he genuinely had no interest in the reconstruction efforts set by Europe. After the war, some people were resentful.

Some had supported the previous agenda.

Others felt ashamed for what they had allowed to happen.

She wasn‚Äôt sure which category he belonged to.

She licked her lips, unsure of what to say next.

After a pause, he spoke again.

‚ÄúDid you like it there?‚Äù His voice was quieter this time. ‚ÄúWas it nice?‚Äù

She considered how to answer.

Not wanting to sound like she was bragging, she carefully said, ‚ÄúYes. It had its perks.‚Äù

Then, in a lighter tone, she added, ‚ÄúI learned how to speak Swedish, though not very well.‚Äù

He gave her a wry look. ‚ÄúWell enough if you work for them.‚Äù

She smirked, but it faded quickly.

‚ÄúSo when you‚Äôre all done,‚Äù he asked, voice unreadable, ‚Äúwill you go back? Or are you staying here?‚Äù

She looked forward, not meeting his gaze.

‚ÄúI believe they want us to stay,‚Äù she admitted. ‚ÄúTo ensure everything goes smoothly. For some countries, having us there was‚Ä¶ hard. They supported us, helped us. But‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äú She hesitated. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time we stand on our own.‚Äù

She felt his hand reach out, grasping hers.

He still didn‚Äôt look at her.

His grip was tight‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot desperate, but firm.

More tears trickled down his face. He wiped them away with his free hand, then pressed both hands over his face, sitting there, motionless.

Then‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa deep, shuddering inhale.

He rubbed his face hard, dragging his hands down before exhaling through his nose, his mouth shut tight.

Like he was swallowing something back.

She could tell he wanted to say something, probably something he had always wanted to say but never had the chance.

Finally, he exhaled, voice heavy.

‚ÄúYou could have stayed,‚Äù he said, his words slow and deliberate.

His eyes flickered with something raw‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääregret, resentment, maybe both.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just stay with me?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúThings would have been all right. I would have protected you.‚Äù

She stilled.

He still believed that? Even after everything?

She let out a breath, shaking her head. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said, her voice quieter but firm. ‚ÄúWhy couldn‚Äôt you have left with me?‚Äù

His brow furrowed.

‚ÄúIt would have been better,‚Äù she continued, her voice thick with emotion. ‚ÄúYes, it was hard at first, but you wouldn‚Äôt have gone through this. You couldn‚Äôt have expected me to live with what happened.‚Äù

Her hands curled into fists.

‚ÄúDo you think I wanted a chip in me too?‚Äù she asked, her voice breaking. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt even allowed to work without your permission. All my money went to you. And you expected me to stay?‚Äù

His posture stiffened, and his jaw tightened. ‚ÄúBut we would have been together,‚Äù he said, his voice rising, defensive. ‚ÄúWe would have worked through it together.‚Äù

She let out a sharp laugh, void of humor.

‚ÄúYou still don‚Äôt get it.‚Äù

His head was still in the sand.

‚ÄúPeople were torn from their homes,‚Äù she said, her voice low, shaking with anger. ‚ÄúFamilies ripped apart. And anyone who opposed their ideals, if they so much as questioned them, they disappeared.‚Äù

Her gaze locked onto his, her eyes burning.

‚ÄúThat was no life,‚Äù she said with a hope he would understand.

She saw the flicker of doubt in his expression but he didn‚Äôt respond.

‚ÄúThere were militias,‚Äù she continued, pressing forward, needing him to hear her. ‚ÄúThey could steal, rape, beat people, accuse them of crimes they never committed, and no one would stop them. Nothing would happen to them.‚Äù

She had hoped this reunion would bring closure.

Or at the very least, that he would finally understand why she left.

‚ÄúYou could have come with me,‚Äù she said, her voice cracking. ‚ÄúYou knew everything I planned. The money I saved. The documents I hid.‚Äù

She blinked back the emotions swelling in her chest.

‚ÄúI tried to tell you. I made sure to know exactly what they were doing. Even when I made my decision.‚Äù

She exhaled sharply, looking down at her hands.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she admitted. ‚ÄúA part of me thought about coming back.‚Äù

His head lifted slightly at that.

‚ÄúBut then they closed the borders shortly after,‚Äù she said, her voice hollow. ‚ÄúYou know there was no way for me to return.‚Äù

She swallowed hard.

‚ÄúEven if I had, I would have been targeted.‚Äù

Her breath shuddered.

‚ÄúYou probably would have never seen me again.‚Äù

The words hung between them, suffocating.

He didn‚Äôt look at her this time.

He just sat there.

She studied his face, but it gave her nothing. No recognition. No acceptance.

Her brow furrowed. Disappointment sank deep into her bones.

She had held onto the belief for over ten years that maybe, just maybe, he would understand.

He refused.

Or worse‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe simply couldn‚Äôt.

She felt bad, but not for leaving.

She felt bad that he still believed everything could have been okay.

Obviously, it wasn‚Äôt.

She let out a slow, measured breath and placed her hands on her lap.

Her shoulders slumped.

Maybe this was it.

Maybe this was the only closure she would ever get.

Hopefully, this was closure for him too.

She stood up, ready to leave.

Once again, he reached for her.

His hand grasped hers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääher right hand‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätightly.

She froze.

Her breath hitched as she felt the pressure of his fingers around hers, unwilling to let go.

Her other hand rose to her face, covering it as a fresh wave of emotion broke through. She began sobbing again.

She stood there, shaking, her mind racing.

What had she been thinking?

She had searched for him. Used the remnants of the citizens‚Äô database from the fallen regime just to make sure he was still alive.

For what?

Had she truly believed they could just pick up where they had left off?

That they could somehow rekindle what once was? That they could fall back into each other‚Äôs arms, deeply in love, as if nothing had happened?

The disappointment consumed her.

She thought of the moment she had signed the divorce papers.

When the American government had demanded that all spouses‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially women‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääreturn to their home country, she had refused.

They tried to force her back.

She had gone to hell and back in Sweden, fighting alongside attorneys who filed mass divorces for women like her‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso they could stay.

She remembered standing in that office, pen in hand, frozen in place before she finally signed her name.

And just like that, her marriage was over.

The room had been suffocating‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfilled with other women and their silent grief.

The sorrow in that space had been thick, inescapable.

She had taken off her wedding ring that day.

Placed it on a chain around her neck.

She no longer wore it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut she still kept it.

Her tears were blinked away. Forcing herself to move, she pulled her hand from his grasp, wiping her face with both hands.

She was glad she hadn‚Äôt worn much makeup.

The Swedish officials had advised against it‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot to stand out too much, not to draw attention.

There was still resentment from those who had stayed behind.

Those who hadn‚Äôt been able to leave.

Her throat ached, cramping with the effort of holding back more tears.

She turned toward the door, swallowing hard.

Behind her, he sat heavily on the couch, his hands pressed against his knees, shoulders hunched.

She choked out, ‚ÄúTake care of yourself.‚Äù

The words felt small, insufficient.

There was a moment of hesitation.

Should she say more? Should she offer to help him?

No.

She wasn‚Äôt even supposed to share where she would be sent next.

Not the town.

Not the city.

Not even the region.

She forced herself forward, walking toward the door.

Behind her, she heard it.

The sound of him crying.

Soft, muffled, almost choked.

She unlocked the door. Opened it. Stepped onto the porch.

It was almost dark now.

For the first time that night, she didn‚Äôt care whether she was safe or not.

She stepped down the rickety two steps onto the uneven pavers, her feet finding the cracks in the sidewalk as she walked away.

1ifkoos,https://www.reddit.com/r/BanGDream/comments/1ifkoos/uika/,Uika,"I feel like Uika is having a harder time than it seems. We still don‚Äôt know much about her background, but the fact that she is a childhood friend of Saki suggests that she‚Äîor at least her family‚Äîcomes from a wealthy background, enough for her to have been able to visit Saki on her private island. We also know that they must have been very close, given that Uika attended and cheered for Saki at CRYCHIC‚Äôs first live performance.

In episode 4 of¬†MyGO, a post-credit scene shows Uika messaging Saki about finally debuting live (through a messaging service, not a social media app). This makes me wonder about the timeline: did Sumimi debut before or after CRYCHIC‚Äôs disbandment? From Anon Tokyo‚Äôs dialogue with Tomori in episode 1 (in the karaoke room), we know that Sumimi was already famous at that time (they were shown on TV, though it wasn‚Äôt a live broadcast). This leaves some room to speculate that the messages in episode 4 could have been sent after CRYCHIC‚Äôs disbandment. And it would mean that, aside from Mutsumi, Saki was also in contact with Uika.

One could argue that Saki communicates normally with others after CRYCHIC disbandment (as long as it's not Tomori). We‚Äôve seen her casually talking with Anon Tokyo, even after Anon invited her to form a band (which is Saki regret). It wasn‚Äôt until Saki found out that Anon had formed a band with Tomori that she began to 'ignore' her.

Fast forward to episode 7 MyGO after Saki runs away from Haruhikage song performance, the first person she contacts is Uika. This again implies that, aside from Mutsumi, Uika is someone Saki truly trusts. Later, they decide to meet up, and while reminiscing about the past, Saki at the end on serious note asks Uika to join her band. Uika accepts without hesitation, not even asking for details, and simply said because it‚Äôs Saki‚Äôs request‚Äîand it‚Äôs also Uika‚Äôs dream to stay by her side forever.

This raises more questions, though. Why didn‚Äôt Uika attend Tsukinomori Middle School with Saki, given that she seems to come from a wealthy background? At the very least, we know they remained in close contact during middle school, as Uika attended CRYCHIC‚Äôs first live performance.

For Uika, being physically separated from Saki wasn‚Äôt a major issue. However, being ghosted (and blocked) by Saki after the close relationship they shared deeply affected Uika mentally. This is especially significant considering how much Uika valued Saki‚Äîshe even considered Saki on par with, if not more important than, her own family in terms of trust and secrecy. This is in stark contrast to Soyo‚Äôs situation, where Soyo‚Äôs attachment was more about wanting to keep CRYCHIC together (believing Saki was the center of the band as its leader). Soyo was willing to do anything to help Saki, but her actions weren‚Äôt driven by personal attachment to Saki herself. As a result, Soyo was able to move on with her life‚Äîuntil she saw Saki crying, which triggered her mental breakdown. For Uika, however, her care for Saki was deeply personal, and she prioritized Saki above everything else (even more than Ave Mujica). This is despite Saki telling Mutsumi that she only had Ave Mujica left‚Äîand even that was already falling apart.

In my opinion, Saki ghosting Uika was particularly harsh. Some might argue it was for Uika‚Äôs sake, so she could focus on her activities with Sumimi, but it backfired. Instead of helping, it intensified Uika‚Äôs anxiety and obsession. We see this in her behavior, such as preparing two cups of coffee every day (likely for about a month now) and allegedly sniffing Saki‚Äôs pillow.

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two.

I have some bad habits, mainly uber, weed and starbucks. I calculated how much I spent on them in Nov/Dec/Jan and weed I averaged 250$ a month, starbucks $200 and ubers I spent $400 (!!!!). 

Obviously starbucks has gotta go. I have a coffee machine at home but its old and just doesn't taste as good so I need to budget in another machine. With weed I want to find an upper limit for the month and try to stick to it. And ubers I'm hoping to fully remove so I can afford a car.  

Following is my current income info and breakdown of my bills. My media subscriptions I share with my family, for which others had been paying till now but all of 2025 will be on my dime. They're mostly there to stay, I just have to pay it. 

Job 1 - pays 30$/h, 2$ per hour overnight top up, 3x12h per week. Paid biweekly, any hours over 80 biweekly is paid at 1.5x 

Set 72h overnights biweekly but can pick up OT as available. Usually taxes take 30% of my take home pay. 

Job 2 - casual and for cash at 35$/h. Taxes to be paid after filing so taking home full gross pay. Paid twice a month on 15th and 31st. No set hours but usually 10h/week.

‚Ä¢ Rent - 1200
‚Ä¢ Student Loan Payment - 1300
‚Ä¢ Family support (money for mom) - 400
‚Ä¢ Phone bill - 90
‚Ä¢ Home & Pet Insurance - 80
‚Ä¢ Internet - 80
‚Ä¢ Hydro - 80 (max)
‚Ä¢ Media subscription - 85
‚Ä¢ Grocery for family - 450
‚Ä¢ Cat food - 100 
‚Ä¢ Investing - 100

Following are my goals for 2025:

1. Buy a car (asap), preferably outright cos my credit score is 680 
2. Wedding in mexico - need to pay for flights and hotel by july - 1500
3. Go to home country for 2 months, will have about 3 weeks paid vacation, rest savings, bills wont stop. Flight + expected expenses there - 3500 

Am I dreaming too large? Can I afford my lifestyle, meet all my goals and have a successful year financially? 

I can pick up overtime, anywhere from 4h to upto 24h a week. What would be a minimum consistent OT I have to do to possibly meet my goals? 

I know at some point I will have to sit with these numbers and try to make sense of it but I am struggling to visualize it that far ahead, especially when all my pay checks can be so different each time.  ",3,1738455920.0,PersonalFinanceCanada,0,0.8,False

I sat in the shop window and ate for probably 15 minutes. Saw countless couples go by with their dogs and they all had iced coffee drinks. Some had kids and shopping bags. They generally looked content. 

It felt so symbolic that I could see them all but none of them noticed me despite it being clear glass between us.

10) A few functions of the Kimmunicator (since Mad Dogs and Aliens season 4)   
11) Kim's class, classmates and teacher - Mister Barkin (since Stop Team Go season 4)   
12) Kim's puppy eye pout (guilt-tripping others into caving into her demand) & Kim's winner phrase ""Jinx, you owe me a soda!"" (declaring oneself as the victor in the contest of finishing your friend's sentence before they complete it)   
13) Kimmobile Interior

7) Shego's bad temper (letting Shego unleash her rage against Drakken in The Twin Factor Season 1 & Emotional Sickness Season 3) & Shego's fear of losing her villain reputation (never disclosing Shego's past on Kim's website despite having threatened to do so in Go Team Go Season 2)   
8) Shego's interests in fashion, beauty and other girly stuffs (giving Shego a backhanded compliment about her makeup in The Big Job Season 4)   
9) Shego's favorite type of flowers - Hydrangea (The Mentor of Our Discontent Season 4)

Furthermore, Kim has a bunch of Shego's outfits & accessories in Kim's possession (Shego's jumpsuit since The Twin Factor Season 1, dating dress, teacher outfit, hairband, earrings, necklace, bracelet, waist belt, high-heels and possibly even underwear since Stop Team Go) 

And given how much Kim and Shego know about each other, the best thing to write about their relationship is to have them understand each other. From knowing to understanding is how i would write it.

Things fit well in a previous house, but aren't fitting great in this one. I'd like to get to 7.1.4, but will probably be at 5.1.0 for a while as I already have equipment for that. People always say there's a multi-use acceptable way to get the couch off of the wall but I'm not seeing it.

Important room notes:
The screen is normally up on the ceiling, only down when watching shows/movies.
Blocking the main entrance to the house with a couch is not wife approved, it's also the main fire egress route.
Blocking path to the room from the front door has low WAF, but is not totally impossible.
The bookshelf is on a cabinet, so it doesn't block the screen. Some chance of moving it elsewhere in the house.
The chair is short and below/behind the screen. It can be moved, but needs to stay in the room because it's my wife's favorite sitting place.
The couches have high WAF and were expensive enough that I'm not replacing them with something smaller, they can move, but must also stay in the room.
Not the best viewing due to extra light, but I occasionally love laying on the floor in front of the fireplace while burning wood and watching a movie.
The coffee table is negotiable, but I'd probably need to replace it with something vs. just get rid of it.
The large opening top left of the image is the opening to the dining room.
There is a large window behind the couch, but it has blackout curtains as does the dining room window.

Current AV equipment:

Ceiling mounted 120"" screen.
LS12000 ceiling mounted over the couch on the left of the image.
KEF R3 Meta fronts.
KEF R2 Meta center (moved into place under screen when viewing).
Some cheap old KLH rear surrounds, replacement TBD.
HSU VTF-2 Mk4, placement TBD.
Denon AVR3312. Plan to upgrade this to an X3800H once I get ceiling speakers installed, but probably +1 year on that as I'll do it when I rewire the house later this year. This, the Bluray player, and cd player need permanent home. A server rack style enclosure has the WAF stamp of rejection.

My SS 17, cannot bear to be at my house for more than a couple of hours at a time on weekends. He has his dad gone for 60% or more of daylight on Saturday and most of the morning/afternoon Sunday until he goes to his mom's. SD 16, occasionally accompanies them. I cannot go because I have a special needs son that cannot tolerate public for long/at all.

During one of the few gaps in time when they were home, I mentioned getting coffee and bringing it back so we could all hang out. SD bf was there and we were having nice conversation. When I mentioned it, SS says ""Oh yeah then we can go to (wherever)"". And my fiance says, ""Yeah we'll just follow you in my car so we can go to (wherever) after"".

So I turn to him and say loudly in front of God and everybody ""Are you paying? Because I'm not paying for a separate car of people, that's absurd"". He said ""Nevermind forget I asked"".

Yeah, forget is right. WTF? Then as I'm leaving to take my son on a ride, he says ""I wasn't trying to make you pay for the coffees, I was going to"". Well then TF did you all agree to it if you're just going to ditch me? I told him to take them to get it, there was no sense in going at the same time.

1ifkhoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkullAndBonesGame/comments/1ifkhoe/suggestion_for_new_pirate_hub/,Suggestion for new Pirate Hub.,"If they're seriously about to launch a 5V5 arena PvP mode I think it needs to include a new pirate hub here are some suggestions. 

Should be in new location on the map with a brothel (not going into the details why brothel. last time the post got removed. To sum it up there's hardly any beautiful women in the game and I believe they did that on purpose) 
The brothel should be place of mini games and a place to reward your crew with. 

It should have a player board listing  available clans to join, match making rooms for PvP and pve events. the type of position a player wants to play and the ship and load out theyll be using. ( currently people are being thrown into groups and then immediately exiting that group when somebody shows up with the wrong loadout) 

Trading tables/ area. A place where people can trade and also list the items they want to trade or need. 

An Oracle that shows players previous cinematics missed from past seasons. Or cinematics of current pirates that the storyline doesn't allow me to meet face-to-face. 

Mini games suggestions 

Five finger fillet 
Knife throwing 
Poker / card games
Drinking game

Fencing 
Bare knuckle boxing 
Slapping competition 
Flint pistol and musket shooting games. 

The top mini games are self-explanatory. well let me start off by saying I don't think the game needs full on Melee combat. I'm an older guy and I'm personally done with the ice-skating no impact swinging wildly until somebody gets ragged doll bunny hopping melee combat. So no sliding back-and-forth while swinging a cutlass at hordes of enemies.

I rather cinematic simple tactical combat. Less complex and sloppy. Rock paper scissors fencing combat nothing too fancy (maybe a little cheating like throwing dirty eye or something).  Sid Meier pirates had 3 action swing, parry and thrust that's it. 
This would be a perfect place to test the waters before deciding to actually add it into the game with content. 

Flint pistol competition should focus on quick and efficient button pushes for reloading,holstering aiming and firing. pressing the right buttons in quick succession for smooth single shot firing, and holstering. 
Something similar but different with the musket maybe just longer range and more focus on arcing your shot. (Once again these are just mini games.) 

Buying a lady of the night ( I'm not asking for a ""hot coffee"" mini game.) should give me a buff called chlamydia lol 

Edit: group emotes.

His parents also invited me to join them at a play that took place around 7. He lives in the town, I don't. So he did go home and he said he couldn't deal with his parents joking about us dating (since I'm a girl). I joked about ""Oh ill just sit in the supermarket until the play"" and he said that's probably the best plan of action. I asked if he was joking and he asked why would he be joking. I walked with him and tried to give him ways I could show his parents were not dating but he said no and that he doesn't want to talk about it so I dropped it. Anyway we got to a gas station a couple hundred metres away from his house and he said he'll see me in two hours. I was pretty shocked and sat on a concrete wall outside the gas station. 

I haven't eaten anything but breakfast and a donut (which he knew) so I was starving, and it was getting cold and dark. I don't drive and had to be dropped and couldn't really walk home. Around 6 it went completely dark and I was really cold so I told him I'm going home. I had to pretend I was at his house the whole time when my dad picked me up, so I walked in front of his gate and said I'm not waiting alone in the dark for him and I got picked up. My friend didn't care much, just said ""we can pick you up from your house in time for the play"" and I said I wanna go home, so my dad picked me up. It was already 15 past 6 and I live 15 minutes away by car so it seemed like a waste of time. He didn't really care, just said ""alr we haven't paid for the tickets yet so we're fine"". He texted me about how good the play was during the intermission and I didn't wanna ruin it for him so I was just nice. My friend also had a lead roll in the play but my mom didn't let me buy tickets so I was really excited to go with him and see her preform. 

I waited until the play was done to tell him I was mad at him. He asked if I was joking and I said no. I explained to him that what he did was insane and I was mad and he didn't seem to argue and did apologise and take blame. The last text he sent was along the lines of ""I'm really sorry, but I cant fix what happened"" and once I replied, I haven't heard from him. I texted him but he didn't respond so I went to WhatsApp and said hey. I went back to check on it and it wasn't read, but it shows he was online after it was sent. Nobody's heared from him since and I honestly feel like he's being selfish by not responding. Also tickets aren't on sale anymore so I won't get to see the play. He's made it clear he had a really good time.

Since then he's been ignoring me, so I told him he either needs to tell me what's wrong or stop acting like this. I recieved a text a little later that he hasn't been purposely ignoring me, just going through some shit and said he doesn't want me to feel guilty over what I said which I'm not sure why I would.

I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in the real, genuine friendship and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in putting in the effort to make things work or might easily jump to someone else :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of making a new, long term friend, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring friend. A friend that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in a best friend. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is really wanting to be buddies with a dude named BlueExodia0.

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about¬†¬†
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Very single at the moment (not something I'm pushing for but if if there happens to be a connection, seeing that develop is something I'm not against)
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

**What qualities do I look for in a friend?**

* Is a human and breathing üòÇ
* **An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)**

I earn a bit more than her but we've been splitting things 50/50. She has said I should pay a larger share of things but I said no up to this point as I've been saving money to buy a house for us which we've discussed numerous times, and I don't expect her to contribute to the deposit as she earns less, so that's where my extra money goes. When she talked to me to break up, she told me for the first time that she was no longer receiving money from the government for her medical condition and so is much worse off each month and is using a credit card to get by, but I never knew this before. In addition, she has had a shopping addiction which she and her parents have acknowledged. I suggested asking her parents who are quite wealthy but she has said they won't help financially. After she told me this, I said I would stop saving for a house to help her but she said it was too late. She cited this as the main reason for the split. I think this is one of those things couples have to go through to progress. We would have to save similarly for a wedding or kids.

Another reason is that we have almost stopped going out on dates. The background to this (aside from the money struggles) is that she gained weight due to a medication for a mental medical condition 3 years ago and has had low self-esteem since. She has tried to eat healthy and exercise much more recently to combat this which was great for her. The weight gain never bothered me but it's really hurting her confidence so I stopped suggesting going out for food and drinks which were our favourite dates due to this, and the fact that we both had the financial pressures discussed above. I have suggested the last few dates we have done and I can't remember the last one we did that she suggested. I asked her to tell me what dates we can do as I struggle to think of dates we can do without pressuring her financially or to be unhealthy. I know there are things like walks and coffee dates but there is only so many times you can do this.

She also said we have been less intimate recently which is true, but I feel this is 2-sided rather than just on me. The cuddles and kisses have got much less. At times when both working from home, I would come up behind her and give her and kiss and cuddle, and sometimes she would tell me to leave her alone. I understand that sometimes she is trying to concentrate so I started doing this less and the little displays of intimacy never quite recovered. She is having a really rough time at work where she feels she isn't paid enough and isn't valued either, and got some rejections from 2 jobs a day before the break up that she had applied for.

Now she has moved back in with her parents. I feel as though she is super overwhelmed with everything and that she is self-destructing, and I'm the casualty. By moving home, her money issues are resolved and her early-retired parents do almost everything for her. Now we're not talking aside from about splitting possessions and moving out.

I really love her with my whole heart and fear she is making a mistake due to being in a really bad place mentally and I want to talk to her but she feels as though I'm blaming her for our problems which I have said I'm not. I also acknowledge that I need to respect her decision. I thought we were heading for marriage and just a week before the split, she sent me some links to styles of houses we could look at buying, so it's really hit me by surprise and like a truck.

I think this is something we could resolve by improving our communication and I'd pay for the couples therapy if she would hear me out and was willing to try but I can't talk to her to suggest it and I'm concerned that after a week apart, it may be too late.

Is there any way to save this relationship? Do I try to talk her out of it now or after a few months? Do I just accept and move on? Is there more that she isn't telling me?

My current setup is a 2019 BBE (the model with the way too high pressure), and I've been pretty happy with it until recently. I think this is however because I really didn't know what good espresso was -- I've previously brewed the same costco dark roast beans for years (which actually work fine because it all kind of tastes the same in 16oz of milk...) but as I've purchased some other specialty beans (medium and medium-dark) roasts I'm really struggling to get consistent extractions. Yes, the BBE has been regularly cleaned, descaled, and I'm using good water. 

I bought a Niche Zero, which is obviously considerably superior to the built in grinder. Unfortunately this hasn't been as much fun as I'd hoped as I find I'm just not well utilizing a lot of expensive coffee. I'm growing more and more frustrated with the BBE -- I think the pressure it generates (14-15 bar) is just causing a lot of channeling and uneven extractions. The same coffee, same niche settings, same process (17g beans, WDT, auto-leveling force tamper) yields pretty different results from shot to shot. Some are nice and drinkable, others a mess and are sink shots.

I am inclined to blame the machine as I think I've dialed in all the other variables as best as I can. The only machine I'm all that intersted in is a Linea micra -- I'm very much a go big once purchaser. The E61 machines don't appeal to me with the long heatup times, and getting another Breville doesn't seem like it'd feel like an upgrade (although maybe one of their better machines that is calibrated to 9bar would be?)

The micra appeals to me because of the fast warm up time and the no frills approach.  I honestly don't see myself chasing after flow profiling ultra light roasts....just not my thing to get that fiddly. But, if there is another machine in the <4k price range with comparable easy of use and performance I'd be very interested to know.

I love my ruby red pearl 2012 3.6R Limited I bought from my parents, but with one HUGE exception. Never in my life have I had to, or even considered, have a mechanic install a fricking headlight bulb....until now!

I watched a bunch of videos, bought a Hella H7LL bulb, and felt ready to tackle the project. The low beam bulb can only be accessed by half-removing the wheel well liner, or dropping the whole bumper assembly. I tried the former. Removing the 4 plastic push rivets wasn't hard, but two broke (fine). I could see half of the grey cap covering the back of the bulb, but when I reached in, I was only working by feel. I could feel the grey cap, but couldn't twist it due to the metal frame piece right up against it. 

I sat in my driveway for an hour total, swearing and hoping I didn't break anything while I was in there. Finally, I called my Subi dealer and they quoted me $45 to replace it. No appointment was needed. I could pull into their Xpress lane and it would take 15-20 minutes. I told them I'd already bought an H7 bulb and asked if it'd drop the price. They said it would knock it down to $25. Great!!!

7:30am today I pulled in, gave them the bulb, asked if they'd show me how to access the bulb, and sat in their nice waiting room with an amazing automatic coffee maker!  30 minutes, nothing. 45, nothing. Finally, after 1 hour, the guy came and got me. When I got back to the service bay, the mechanic had it up on a lift, had taken the wheel off and dropped the entire wheel well liner! He managed to get the cap off and was going to install the bulb. Back to the waiting room.

30 minutes later, the manager came out and told me that he's going to comp my entire service for the delay and that the metal retaining clip had sprung into the engine bay when they tried to put it back on. They didn't have another and were going to call another dealer because Subaru doesn't sell them separately. If they couldn't get another clip, they'd just replace the entire headlight assembly at no charge!

20 minutes later, he came out and said they found the clip and my car was ready.  

1) I don't feel so bad about not being able to do this myself

2) I can't believe I got out of a dealership service bay for $0

2) Whoever designed this may rot in hell",12,1738454453.0,Subaru_Outback,9,1.0,False

1ifk0mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/1ifk0mv/i_have_a_disabled_so_who_ive_been_married_to_for/,I have a disabled SO who I've been married to for 34 years and I'm considering leaving him,"I'm a mess right now and I really need to vent / a hug / some advice. I've been following this sub for a while with my main account but am using this alt for privacy as my kids know my main user name. Sorry in advance that this is going to be long. It helps me to keep it straight in my head to write it all out.

I'm a 60F, and my husband is 62M and we have two adult kids. We've been married for 34 years and he was diagnosed with young onset Parkinson's 24 years ago. It has been a slow moving illness up until the last couple of years, but lately the mental changes have been brutal for our marriage. Although our marriage hasn't been that good for a long time, either. I've felt for a long time that he disregards my feelings and that I've become just a caretaker and not a wife.

Several years ago my SO stopped bathing regularly or changing his clothes very often. I was patient with this at first, thinking that it was related to depression (common in Parkinson's patients). And while my kids were young SO would often spend many many hours online playing video games 24/7, and not paying attention to them or to me. Again, I figured this was his way of dealing with his illness, so I didn't push hard enough to make him stop. 

After a while I used to ask him to please bathe and change clothes and sometimes he would. But more often he would say okay and then not get to it for two or three more days. Suffice it to say, we haven't had sex in over five years, and at this point I have no interest in sex with him.

About six months ago I made a new friend with a man through my business. This is \*only\* relevant in that it made me realize exactly how terrible my relationship with my SO has become. The friendship with this new man has never progressed beyond having coffee - not even a kiss or anything. And I have no intention to start (my life is enough of a dumpster fire to add another layer of crazy). But there was a small amount of flirtation and he actually seems to care what I have to say, and treats me respectfully. Just like normal people. The contrast with how my SO treats me was just so starkly different, that it made me so sad.

A few months ago my SO had a change to medication that caused him to start having hallucinations and delusions. He started believing that he has parasites in his body, and started trying to dig them out. Then he started believing the parasites were in his intestines and started demanding that people look at photos of his poop. The worst day was when he started digging through his poop to prove that he has parasites. 

Through all this at first I humored him, took him to the ER at his insistence (nothing found) and his primary doctor (also nothing found). Finally after a couple of weeks I got his neurologist to see him on the neurologist's day off, and he reduced the dosage of the new medication. That reduced, but did not eliminated the hallucinations. But my SO stopped tearing at his skin and looking through his poop so that was better. At that time I was so stressed out by all this that I started talking to a therapist, which has been helpful. 

The new big thing that has thrown me off happened about two weeks ago, and is making me consider separating or divorcing my SO. 

One morning he said to me that he had found a young woman online who lives in Colorado (we live on the east coast, USA) and had taken care of her father while he had Parkinson's. Supposedly this woman was now broke and living in her car. 

SO then said he had invited her to come to live with us and take care of him, and that she was coming to have a job interview. That she was on her way. I immediately said it was absolutely not going to happen. 

I asked if he had sent her money for a plane ticket and he said no. I then checked my banking app and found he had already sent her $900, so he lied about that. His rationalization for lying was that he sent her money to drive, not for a plane ticket. I flipped the F out and told him that if she shows up that I'm leaving him. He then said he would tell her not to come and that he would not contact her again. 

That day I had to take him to a medical appointment, and I tried really hard to hold it together because all I wanted to do was cry. On the drive home from the doctor couldn't hold it back any more and was driving home with tears streaming down my face (fortunately it was rush hour so we were sitting in a traffic jam). He just looked over at me a couple of times and didn't say a word.  

That absolutely broke me. I just felt like he doesn't actually care about me, or what I want, not even enough to comfort me when I'm distraught.

Then he sent her another $200 two days later ""because she was stranded."" (He couldn't explain why the prior $900 wasn't enough.) 

I'm the primary breadwinner in the house, and bring in 75% of our income, with the rest being from his SSDI, so I'm particularly salty to think that the money that I worked very hard to earn was given to her.

At that point I was so angry that I moved into our guest room, and told him I'm considering leaving. He begged me to try counseling. At first I said no because he will just bullshit the therapist. But I talked to mine and she suggested that a few marriage sessions with another therapist might help clarify the situation, so I agreed, and we're waiting for an appointment slot.

Which brings me to today when one of his friends called me to let me know that SO had also created a group chat with some of his old friends (that he hasn't seen in several years) and asked them to contribute to helping this woman. The woman, on the other hand, used the group chat to contact individual friends and send them porn photos and videos. So yeah, she's a scammer and possibly a sex worker (no disrespect intended to SWs).

I didn't want to bust the friend who ratted him out, so I just asked my SO If other people were involved with helping her, and he said no, so that's lie number 3. I then confronted SO with the information (not mentioning which friend told me) and he became very angry that one of his friends would ""stir the pot"" (he actually guessed wrong about who told me).

I was so angry that I just left the house without saying anything and have been driving around and walking on the beach trying to stop crying. Right now I'm in my office at work trying to get my shit together. 

I think I'm done. Even when he tried to explain why this wasn't such a bad thing for him to do, it was such bullshit. He said that when he gave this woman money it without telling me that it was similar to when I gave one of our kids money for rent and only told SO a couple of days later. He also started bringing up business decisions I had made, some of which hadn't worked out too well, and compared that to him deciding to give the woman money. He says it's the same thing because I hadn't consulted him on those business decisions.

I guess here's where I'm stuck - I think it's important to stick by your spouse if they become ill, but when is enough enough? I literally feel like I'm drowning with this man and his bullshit. That he doesn't actually care about me, and that he gaslights me with his rationalizations. Even if he eventually gives me a decent apology I'll always wonder if that's only so he doesn't lose his caretaker.

And then on the other hand I think he will end up in some kind of assisted living / care home without me, and that seems like a terrible thing for him.

I feel so lost.

1ifk0dw,https://v.redd.it/s4rsun078mge1,Rotation: Feb BTS,"The remaining coffee should arrive midweek, likely Wednesday, and everything should be fully completed by Friday.

I focused on variety rather than depth, so most offerings will be small, around 200 grams per option, roughly 10 servings per coffee box. The goal isn‚Äôt to stockpile but to introduce as many unique coffees as possible, giving people access to a wide range of flavors and origins in a way they wouldn‚Äôt get anywhere else.

By supporting the Rotation project and purchasing coffee in single servings, you are doing more than just buying coffee. You are helping build a platform for FUTURE unknown roasters and farmers. This model allows them to get their offerings into people‚Äôs hands without the massive financial risk that usually comes with scaling. The industry is not built to give small players a shot, but this project changes that. It is a way for quality to rise without barriers, where the best coffee gets recognized not because of a big brand name but because it speaks for itself.

If I tried to make this project flawless from the start, I would be stuck in an endless loop of tweaking and second guessing, and this would never see the light of day. This project is raw, it is unfinished, but that is the point. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve asked dozens of times for reviews and feedback. I want to move as quickly as possible because this needs the buy in of a community willing to shape it, refine it, and prove that this approach works.

I am pushing forward despite industry players telling me this is impossible, never going to have scale, bad economic model. The coffee world has its gatekeepers, its traditionalists, its so called experts who look down on anything that challenges the norm. And then there are the armchair critics, the Reddit threads and Discord groups full of people tearing this apart from a distance. They hate the coffee we currently offer, they call xyz roaster/bean shit, but when you look at their history, their body of work, you  soon realize these people have never build or done anything of significance on their own.

They call out the environmental impact of my packaging( trying to shame this project because I‚Äôm not using expensive glass containers), they scoff at my lack of certifications, they judge me because I am not an academic or a polished industry insider. 

This project is not for them. It is for the people who are want to expand their taste, knowledge, & experience a wider range of coffee in bite sized cups.  ",8,1738453985.0,coffeerotation,3,0.9,False

So, why am I here, especially with all the dating apps out there? Honestly, because Reddit just feels more authentic. I‚Äôm tired of the same old cycle on dating apps‚Äîmatches, dates, and then... nothing. Maybe they talk over you when they're drunk, dominate the conversation, or ghost you with no explanation. I‚Äôm over the empty feeling that lingers after that.

What I‚Äôm after is something different. I‚Äôm looking for an old-fashioned romance‚Äîthe kind where you go on real dates, where I get picked up at my place and we never, ever end up at your home. I want to make memories in real-life settings, not just online or in someone‚Äôs living room.

When I‚Äôm not working, you‚Äôll find me writing, drawing, listening to synthwave, or watching nostalgic 80s/90s films. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the original *Gossip Girl* (2007‚Äîno reboots, please!) and would love a partner who‚Äôs down to binge it with me. I also love movies like *Dogfight*, *Cruel Intentions*, *Stand By Me*, *Career Opportunities*, *Secret Admirer*, and *The Bling Ring*. My playlists are filled with dreamy synthwave tracks like ‚ÄúSunset‚Äù by The Midnight, ‚ÄúSummer Eyes‚Äù by Coastal, and ‚ÄúMiracle Love‚Äù by Lazer Club.

While I love my independence, I‚Äôm ready to share my life with someone who feels like my best friend. I want a connection built on laughter, trust, and genuine care‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôs up for creating silly inside jokes, enjoying the little things, and always having each other‚Äôs backs. I crave those romantic moments‚Äîwhen you lock eyes, share a smile, and know you've found your person.

What I‚Äôm looking for:

* Age: 28-37
* Height: 5‚Äô10‚Äù or taller
* Build: Slim/fit/lean
* Lifestyle: Drug-free (molly, edibles, coke, etc.) with moderate drinking okay
* Location: Connecticut or within 25-35 miles, US/Canada preferred
* Relationship goals: Long-term, monogamous, with marriage potential. Bonus points if you‚Äôre open to starting a family someday!

Non-negotiables: You‚Äôre emotionally available, employed, stable, single, and not in touch with exes. I want someone who‚Äôs fully present and invested. I value open communication and consistency‚Äîthe small gestures and thoughtful texts go a long way for me.

If you‚Äôre kind, stable, and looking for a relationship full of joy and mutual respect, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Please include a photo, and if we vibe, I‚Äôll share one back. Let‚Äôs see where this journey could take us! üíï",1,1738453799.0,r4r,1,0.6,False

They even talked about irl friends they would get into projects with and discord/telegram friends who could help them with this, along with their different wallets they set up to try and pull this.  

Obviously, I know this happens and anyone who's in their first week would realize this.

1ifjso9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ifjso9/i_can_fix_her/,I Can Fix Her,"Laura. She stood five foot three with webbed feet from birth and matching birthmarks on both of her thighs. One was shaped like her father, the other her mother‚Äîor so she would say. To me they looked like black splashes roughly the same, the left slightly larger, more jagged than the other, them both mottled by patches of dark brown. 

A single hair came out long from the softer one.

She showed them to me three weeks after we met on a wet park bench at 3am. Her webbed feet came first, but they didn't concern her much. Said she didn't see the fuss. Not since highschool, she said. Her curves and short stature made her a terrible swimmer and the other girls had made a sport of pointing out the irony, among other meaner things. And my Laura was ironical in many ways more than that. 

The mark of her father was the more painful. Tears welled in her eyes as she traced the contours of the sharpest edge and explained the meaning of its strange geometry. But it was hard to follow after the part with the wooden cane. Her speech lapsed fast and every third or fourth word sounded something like Arabic; and it was Arabic, it turned out.

Stunning language, Arabic is. Even directions to the restroom sound poetic, in Arabic. To me they did, at least.

She wrote to me on a napkin once: 

*'ahibuni kama law 'anah la yastatie wala*

I never asked what it meant, don't ask me why, and translating her words now, after what happened‚Äîafter what she did‚Äîis the furthest thing from anything I can ever see myself doing by choice. 

Same thing happened with the mark on her mother's side, but it was Italian that she drifted to then. I was too mesmerised to say anything. Just followed her expressions and inflections as best as I could. A different kind of pain came when her language shifted that time, hitting hardest, from what I could tell, over the patch where that long hair grew from. Near impossible not to embrace her when she winced. And then the hair itself brought a smile, just long enough to show how complex that relationship was.

On the other side of the napkin‚Äîwhich I still have, somewhere, actually‚Äîshe wrote: 

*Ma non nel modo in cui ha fatto lei*

I'd never met a girl with natural metaphors on her legs before. Not that she saw things that way, of course. It couldn't have endeared her more, and her trauma made my insides rise a fire up. I don't think it much mattered that I didn't follow everything. It was all about her. I was her safety, more like, which was how it had been since the beginning. 

Since the night I'd been walking home late and found her holding unsteady to the other side of the barrier. The one on the high bridge over the river.

She was too fucked on DXM to remember it the next day, where she'd been, how she'd gripped my back and cried into my neck as I carried her. All she had were the photos. Some public bathroom mirror, it looked like: bright red lipstick and a brighter red jacket and her smile this demented blend of dissociation and euphoria. Like she was ready for her own party. And then the video of her walking to that party. Holding the front camera towards her as she danced and rambled and sang fuck knows what while flashes of midnight traffic passed her by.

I slept on the couch and called a cab before I woke her.

Surprisingly, she wasn't that surprised. 

She smiled at me actually. Then kept smiling. And then she asked what was for breakfast. Her lipstick smeared Joker-like to one side and she smelt like an admixture of three perfumes and green grapes. 

Reflexively, I said, ""Poached eggs and avocado.""

Her smile widened as she replied, ""Can you do scrambled?""

""Reckon I can manage that.""

Completely forgot about the cab and pretended I wasn't home when the doorbell rang, which she found hilarious. ""Scaredy cat,"" she called me. 

""Not a scaredy cat. You're a distraction is all.""

And she smiled her biggest smile yet.

She stayed all day and we ordered pizza for an early dinner. I didn't know how to ask her tactfully, but I tried my best. Just after the movie finished and I was putting the boxes in the bin. Didn't want to make a big deal, just in case.

""So what were you doing on the bridge last night?""

And she winced, and looked away. 

It was raining outside. Heavy rain, and there was no traffic on the street.

And then she was hugging me where I stood.

And my big arms were around her firm as she squeezed.

She couldn't remember the bridge. But she must have remembered the before. Too much shame in her eyes, for otherwise. I pieced the DXM later on, after finding out about her issue with substances, the pharmaceuticals which were the ones she was able to order safely online. 

We didn't speak of it again until just after 3am on a wet park bench, three weeks later. That's when I saw the photos, and the video, and that's the first time that my heart broke while sitting beside the same person that it felt for.

A month after that, she moved in.

So too her makeup and fashion collection, which took up half the fucking apartment, I swear. Good thing I'd gotten an Aurelius hard-on the previous summer and thrown most of my excess away, so there was just enough space. 

I didn't mind, not really. 

Rooms had a way of expanding when we were close. And my small two-bedroom had turned into a palace.

She quit the drugs and accepted the diagnosis she'd been resisting and began a strict regime of exercise, reading, and medication. Four pills of a morning, one at night, a PRN for when things went haywire, which had been happening frequently and had been the look on her face in the bathroom mirror before she'd danced to the river that night. 

She was, by every measure I could discern, saved.

I had saved the life of a person‚Äîand how she loved me, and with what intensity she loved‚Äîfrom themselves, helped her find the self that she'd been but forgotten and there on my chest each morning her waking smile was the heart-stop of my paralysis. 

And in the twilights of the night when I woke from a dream to another dream of her there with half that beautiful smile on her face as she slept, I barely noticed the hair go in. Nor did I notice the sound that it made, lower down, under the sheets, quiet beneath the edge of my awareness. That horrid suctioning, of some nightmarish leech.

All I could feel was the warm soft of her skin; and she made sure, even when she was gone those nights, that some part of herself was against me, our bodies always touching, somehow. 

And then, more than a year later, after her medication had stopped again, and the manias began again, and I found a receipt for the DPH in the bin, I finally looked in the mirror. Really looked, I mean. 

It's kind of funny, the things you don't notice in routine glances, when grooming, making sure your hair doesn't look like shit, taking that brief acknowledgement of self in your reflection each morning.

Or the changes in your energy reserve each day. That six months prior you were someone else. All too easy to blame it on smoking weed again, and quitting before starting again. On your old depression returned.

When I looked in the mirror that day, that's when everything changed.

I still don't know how she did it. How those purple veins that vectored hideous from that puss-filled hole on my thigh had all been invisible. Or how it was gone when I tried to show her after confronting her about her medication and the DPH. 

She pretended not to hear. Screamed that the meds held her back and changed her for the worst and the manias were part of her and weren't manias at all. That she was gaining weight because of the Olanzapine, had nothing to do with not exercising anymore. That I'd forced the diagnosis on her that had been ruining the person that she was, the one who danced and felt and felt free.

The reflection in the mirror, it wasn't me at all. My jaw had sunken in guant-like beneath dark recesses beneath eyes turned flat, tired, and half dead. 20kg on the scales gone, my muscular frame then withered, practically cadaverous.

And on the mornings after those confrontations, she'd smile.

That fucking smile.

Like Futurama's Hypno Toad, it was. Beams of unparalleled love that gazed and gazed and seemingly filled everything that l had lost. An impossible love to fake, yet too intense to be entirely real. Just as impossible, in that state, to resist.

And looking in the mirror, still hypnotised in her smile's afterglow, once again, I looked perfectly fine. 

But something in my perception had changed. 

I wasn't sleeping the same. I was barely sleeping at all. Not without THC and nicotine, which we mix together where I'm from. A compound addiction that I'd struggled with in the past, that served the denial better than well.

The weed would wear off at precisely 3am each night: just in time, long after it had begun, to feel the first itch of the hair going in.

That wasn't a hair at all. 

And on hot summer evenings well over a year after the bridge the bedsheets would slip away and our bodies became a smooth pale grey in the half-light. 

Illuminated such, that finally, one night, I was able to see.

The pain was the thinnest of needles, at first. Like the proboscis of some oversized mosquito. But it didn't last long. Other senses flooded in and overlapped and replaced themselves. 

The second, was the noise. A rhythmic kind of squelching, rubbery and wet and hideously alive; a sign of something dreadful happening, down there. That alone was terrifying enough. But it wasn't the worst of it. Not even close.

The third sense, looking down at my exposed thigh, is what I saw.

Laura's left-side birthmark had moved. Her feet were crossed between my calves and her softer black splash, the one that she called her mother, was gone. 

It was on me. 

Twice the size it had been, and the underside of its surface, facing upwards, shined like a varnished leather in the dim. And there was motion...and it was heaving. Its edges were affixed to my skin and its interior was rising and expanding bubble-like before it drooped and flattened down, then back up, paused a moment, and went back down again.

That's when the hypnosis came to an end. 

I didn't move. Couldn't even if I was able. All three senses rapidly collided and I wanted to scream, but couldn't do that either, and I stared hopeless and helpless as this black mark, this *thing*,  steadily vacuumed some substance from out deep within. From within *me*. And then it stopped, and it must have realised that I was watching, and it flattened itself again, and remained still, and then my ears began to ring loud as my sight became dotted and increasingly dense with these dots that caved a thickening border inwards, until finally, quickly, that ghastly image, and the room, were gone.

And when I woke, gone was everything.

The bedding beside me was well-made, the pillow untouched. The racks of clothes that had long suffocated my bedroom, were gone.

Laura was no-where to be seen.

It was only the puss-filled hole in my thigh, now wide as a jar lid, that remained. Throbbing drainingly and painfully as I got out of bed and limped to the kitchen and rested my body achingly on the bench, head down, eyes looking up, scanning hopeless, looking over what had once been the palace that we made.

Laura, was no-where to be seen. 

Not the smallest trace that she'd ever been there. Just the minimalism of the Stoicism that I'd forgotten: several books neat on a shelf, the old second-hand couch before the sparce wooden coffee table, a sole plant in the corner unwatered, and half dead. Everything still, and quiet, so quiet you could almost hear a static in the air. 

Laura. Had she ever been there?

Only the memory remained, and from inside it suddenly bloomed, like an antibody to the pain, filtering out over the stark of the reality that was before me...and the room filled with colours vibrant with life unseen and it was Ghost BC from the stereo, quick footsteps on the floorboards and laughter that was louder than the music, before finally, inexplicably, she was there. And it was the two of us. Me full-bodied the both of us healthy-skinned and I was picking her up and spinning her around and around as she laughed and giggled carefree and blissful...and when we toppled to the couch, I glided into them as myself, and felt the soft press of her body underneath, and it was the gaze of her smiling eyes staring into mine as I leant my head down slow, our lips interlocking rhythmic, that old crescendo of love transfigured through skin, a kiss that consumed all else.

Then gone went that world, and it was only her, wrapped a bundle in the sheets, looking at me, smiling. 

Always smiling.

And when I woke that night I looked back, how I do not know, with a smile of my own. One of love, and forgiveness, somehow. But it was a forgiveness for no-one. For someone who I thought that I knew, the beautiful girl I thought had been saved, who couldn't be saved because she had killed herself a long, long time ago.

Tears in my eyes and that pain in my leg, all of a sudden. 

I yawned with fatigue, and checked my phone. 

It was 3am. 

Heavier than ever, I raised my head. Moonlight fell a slant through the window and spread angular to the other side of the bed; a scene that looked almost liminal: greylight between a half dark across nothing, to something empty.

But I couldn't have been alone. Somehow, by some force, she must have known.

Suddenly my reverie broke as the room lit-up. It was light from my phone.

It was a message from Laura.

A loud flash of ringing in my ears, and it was a falling weight in the air. But I felt no surprise, or fear. The only surprise was that, in spite the surrealism of the nightmare I found myself in, I felt nothing. The day had been a blur. Was still a blur. The dots came too, for a moment, and still I felt nothing. I grabbed the phone. It was numbness, maybe. Sterile numbness. 

It took three attempts for the passcode to work. I opened WhatsApp, and our old chat, the one that once told the story of everything when apart, was empty. Only this one new message, which was a video.

I hit play.

The screen was blank, at first. Then a flash of distortion over white, and it was my bathroom from the perspective of the loungeroom. And it was me, standing next to the bathroom doorway, wide-eyed and unblinking and impossibly still, staring directly at the camera. Some other me, who looked exactly like me, but surely can't have been. 

*And surely would never be.*

He‚Äîor it‚Äîthen turned drone-like with a wooden stiffness, its widened eyes still locked, and it grabbed a rope hanging high from a cluster of nails over the door. I couldn't absorb the image properly‚Äîso unbelievably fucking insane it was‚Äîbut neither could I stop watching. 

The knot of the noose was already done. And it was gripping it, gesturing it at the camera, its blank expression cracked awful into the ghastliest of smiles, and slow it stepped onto the chair I then saw and took the ring and brought it up and over and down around its neck...

And then there was Laura. 

Some other Laura, this fully naked Laura, covered head-to-toe with black splashes that writhed and bubbled and glistened with alien wet.

I barely registered her voice. It wasn't until the video stopped, that I knew what she had said. I guess that's how the mind works, sometimes. When it's numb, and half dead.

She said, ""You know something, you abusive cunt? You destroyed me. You killed everything that I was. So please do this for me, won't you? And be sure to stream it live, just like this. So I can see.""

It was her who kicked the chair.

My Laura.

A few weeks later I sent her a message. She'd been able to send me one, after all. Said that I hoped she was doing better than she was‚Äîto imply, no hard feelings, to forestall her guilt, if she ever freed herself from those things, just in case. Love always, Garry. Which sounds batshit crazy, I suppose. Well see, in the end I didn't care about the video. Wherever and whatever she was, I knew those early days were real. Maybe we were mismatched, but, they were real. She wasn't to blame for herself, not with those parasitic black marks on her legs. And there's no better way of letting go, than to forgive.

Forgiveness through which you start to regrow, and find that withered flicker of strength you once knew.

Only, letting go in the heart...it still leaves the problem of the body. And the depression, and the weed that sends it south, the old habits that undid you. So when you meet someone new not long afterwards, someone perfect in ways never imagined, how much can really be said, for hope?

Because I did meet someone, just like that. Someone just like me, mostly, at first, only a little bit more. And a little bit less. Her perfection no less in her less than her more. 

The outside beauty, just a bonus.

But my body wasn't ready, I don't think. Not for someone as weird as I am. Maybe it is now, now that I'm strong again, but now, I'm not even sure I know who she is, either. Not after today. Not after another hint, of that old, immature sadistic. 

Maybe we shouldn't choose while we're still weak. Maybe, we can get it wrong. That we need to wait till we're strong, again.

See when we fall, and our bodies fail our minds, that's when we learn a person. We learn what they choose to see; we learn their projections, and their interpretations, of things. And yet, I still don't know what I've learned. Maybe black marks, they aren't always borne of trauma. I really don't know. But I don't think I care, not really. 

Not anymore. 

You take her idea with you all the same. You love her at her worst no less than her best. Love her for what's hidden, deep down, and inside. And what she hides, can be worth it all.

That which strength gives.

And so you clean your space and do the work and strengthen yourself, for yourself, by yourself. You become the person that you are. Never for her, no matter the her. Not for anyone. Least of all, for someone like Laura. 


Laura. That girl I knew once, who wanted to be saved, who I thought I could fix, who only wanted love, who gave me love and her beautiful webbed feet, and nothing else.

Who never wanted to fix herself.

1ifjr8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/disneylandparis/comments/1ifjr8o/review_sequoia_lodge_gfc_suite_surface_deep_luxury/,(Review) Sequoia Lodge GFC Suite - Surface deep luxury,"tl;dr The suite was quite nice and having somewhere quiet that's your own to relax in both during park opening hours and after was a bonus. However the decor was fading, the amenities non-existent and the service lacking making the price paid not worth it whatsoever. Personally, I'd rather save my money for doing another trip or putting it towards a WDW trip instead.

A more in-depth review is below.

# Price

I booked in early October 2024 for a 4 night and 5 day stay in mid-January in the Golden Forest Club Suite. I also wanted to maximise our time in the parks so booked a sandwich hotel on either side of our stay. I opted to go for the standard rooms at Sequoia lodge so that we could remain in the hotel despite the added premium. My total quoted price was **¬£3,500** for the suite and I then paid **¬£250** for two standards rooms before our stay and **¬£450** for two standard rooms after our stay. Initially I booked these directly through DLP and was led to believe I was getting a steep discount, specifically 40%, but when compared to booking through sites such as Booking/Expedia it turns out I was paying almost double the price. I complained to DLP about this and they replied that I'd be missing out on their *""flexible booking Terms and Conditions""* which offered *""the possibility to modify or cancel your reservation up to 7 days before the start of your stay, at no additional modification or cancellation fees""*. Something also offered by BookingCom.

# Check-In

The entire process was like pulling teeth and after a rather uncomfortable trip on the Eurostar we just wanted to get to our rooms. Our stay in the GFC suite was from Monday night to Thursday night and I had booked standard rooms for the Sunday night and Friday night. Either the system was causing trouble, or the staff could not understand why I had or would need 3 separate bookings. We were finally issued with passes for our standard rooms and then the GFC suite and magic passes. On the final day our key passes did not work for our sandwich rooms and our rooms were in the furthest section of the hotel which meant trudging back to a heaving reception, which isn't quite as fun after 100k+ steps over the previous few days. The GFC check-in desk is also right next to the luggage room, so expect there to be a queue at peak times and a lack of staff.

Conveniently, I was asked if I would like to upgrade our sandwich rooms to the GFC suite for the lovely price of ¬£1,000 for each night. 

# The Suite

I snore quite loudly, enough so that it disturbs my children's sleep at times so when I initially made my booking I requested a specific layout that I had seen appear in some videos when I had been researching the rooms. This was done back in October 2024 and I had a swift reply from the GFC concierge to let me know a note had been on my booking and it would all be sorted when we arrived. Upon arrival however this did not appear to be the case. Finally after racking my brain for the French word for ""floor plan"" a cast member pulled out a booklet with pictures/layout of each room and we were able to sort something out. 

Opening the door of the suite was quite magical, [there were some treats on the table for us](https://i.imgur.com/qQmjioO.jpeg) and there was a lovely smell in the air, though absent from the standard rooms and floors. The suite consisted of a [lounge area](https://i.imgur.com/T1wijl9.jpeg) with three armchairs, a sofabed [and a table with chairs](https://i.imgur.com/LEE2CoX.jpeg). There was also a sink with [tea/coffee making facilities](https://i.imgur.com/GrBT66F.jpeg) that you can find in all of the standard rooms. Off from this was [the bedroom](https://i.imgur.com/YmkzYEU.jpeg) with a king size bed and two arm chairs. [The bathroom](https://i.imgur.com/K8IHI1c.jpeg) was quite disappointing, [pretty much a copy](https://i.imgur.com/o8boXwn.jpeg) of [the one in the standard rooms](https://i.imgur.com/ANG2Tw2.jpeg) with the added bonus of no shower curtain, so unless you huddled into the corner water would splash everywhere. 

The bed is no different from the ones in the standard rooms, possibly slightly larger. Not very comfortable at all and the mattress has seen better the days. The sofabed was no better, creaking away with every movement and in the end I let my children take the bed whilst I pulled the sofabed mattress onto the floor and slept there. A nice touch was that housekeeping did make my floor bed up each day, but I was still paying a couple of thousand to sleep on a thin mattress on the floor. 

From a distance the suite seemed quite clean and lovely, but on closer inspection there were issues. Some stains on the armchairs, sofa and carpet; evidently the ""showing its age"" comment people make about Sequoia. The sparkly wallpaper was torn in quite a few places and had just been stuck down rather than replaced. The bathroom hadn't been cleaned and there was quite a bit of hair in the sink and toilet. Perhaps not an issues for most, but it did making the suite less appealing to me for the price. The standard rooms also suffered from this. Stains on the chairs, bathrooms not cleaned properly, rubbished left in the rooms and broken pieces of furniture. 

# Services & Amenities

On the first day in the suite we were provided with two bottles of water, these quickly disappeared as there's nowhere on Disney property to get large bottles of water. In any other hotel these would be replenished each day however it seems at Sequoia lodge, bottled water is a closely guarded treasure and only available to guest on their first night. I did run into the housekeeping staff on our second day, conveniently with crates of bottled water, but they were reserved for new guests. 

I'm not sure how much Disney is saving, or perhaps earning by forcing people to continue buying bottled water but this did leave a bad taste in my mouth that I sadly couldn't wash away. The same with toiletries such as the little shampoo bottles, when they're gone they're gone. At least the little chocolates were replenished every day however. Another point that annoyed me was the toilet paper, 1ply would be generous and at times it did appear to be almost completely see through. It may seem like I'm complaining about minor things, but when you're paying for a suite you expect suite level amenities and not to be wondering whether the tap water is drinkable and worrying about how many times you should fold the toilet paper. 

# Food

With our booking, and I assume all GFC bookings, breakfast was included as well as drinks between noon and 10:30pm and snacks between 4pm and 5:30pm. All of this was served in the GFC lounge and it was nice to have somewhere to eat that was less chaotic than the standard restaurant. Less, but not completely chaos free. I cannot blame Disney for this, but people are still feral in the GFC and you can expect other guests to be sneezing all over the food, coughing in your face and barging you out of the way to get a Mickey shaped waffle. 

Breakfast wasn't too bad, the usual servings of sausages/bacon/eggs/toast/cheese and whatnot. There were two machines serving fresh orange juice, but one seemed to be dead and the other was stocked once in a blue moon so we only got some fresh OJ once. Drinks during the day are served directly to you in a small glass and whilst they seemed to be unlimited, trying to find someone to serve you was a bit difficult. During snack time the chaos returned and the lounge quickly filled up. The savoury sandwiches and mini-bagels were quite stale but the cakes and desserts were quite enjoyable.

One of my children suffers from a disability which makes being in crowded environments with lots of stimulation difficult and painful, and after an eventful day in the parks this can mean not being able to deal with the restaurants or Disney village for food. It was a tad annoying to see that room service is not a thing, despite receiving an e-mail informing me that there were [""in-room services""](https://i.imgur.com/WJvbibi.jpeg) on offer. Reception informed me that we could order through UberEats, but would have to collect from the gate or we could order from the bar downstairs. They could not deliver to the room, so I trudged downstairs to order some club sandwiches for us and then trudged back after 20 minutes to collect them. 

# Conclusion

Whilst we enjoyed our time in the park and there was a certain cosiness to the suite, our experience seems to showcase the core problem that DLP suffers from. Services are being gutted or outright removed and prices increased in order to maximise profit. It seems that Disney want to spend as little money as possible on you whilst extracting as much as possible from you, all in the hopes that the ""magic"" is enough to draw you back. They are a company and margins are tight, but with other parks available in Europe as well as the constant lure of the US parks and Tokyo, it makes it difficult to continue visiting Paris.

I've got two further trips planned this year already, the Princely Suite in the Hotel and a suite in Newport Bay. I was also hoping to book Sequoia again for Christmas as the theming is perfect for that time of year but I'm seriously considering cancelling it all after this experience.

I'm assuming she thought I was going to ask for her number but she looked happy when I said goodbye and never asked for it. I would have small talk with her about class every now and then for 2 weeks. She always seemed nervous but I just assumed it's because it's not everyday someone you don't know walks up to you and starts a conversation but the other day she seemed very nervous.

        This day I talked to her longer, (about 30 mins) her face started to get red and she was fidgeting a lot. Every time she talked she'd stutter nervously. I thought she wasn't into me because of that first day interaction but after seeing her body language that day I asked her to get coffee with me and she said yes. I told her I was gonna go study and she said she wanted to charge her laptop so she got up and we studied together for a couple hours. I was surprised because I usually just talk to her and leave to study somewhere else. 


        I got her Instagram and told her what time I'd pick her up and she agreed. When it came to be that time she texted me ""heyy im so sorry im not going to be home until later today something with my mom came up but if you're up for it we can try another day?"" I said ""Ah that's okay, is your mom okay?"" And I never got a response back and it's been about 2 days since then and she's been posting stuff on her story. This isn't the first time this happen to me. Im not sure why because I often get told that im charming and attractive. I look similar to Fynn rider but with a groomed beard. I can hold a long conversation so it's not like that's an issue. Im thinking that most woman just write me off as a playboy and as nothing serious.

So, I've been up and down this thread and trying anything I found online and nothing ever seemed to save me. I did switch birth controls a couple times during the last three years, one of which was the copper iud and i still had issues. What I've been doing with my current partner (who has given me bv muuullttiple times) is i started to put a little bit if metro gel in my vagina after any time i had let him finish inside of me. That seemed to keep the bv at bay (this is probably not a good idea just because of bacterial resistance that could grow). Anyways, moving forward. 

Now it's possibly a couple things, but I've switched over my probiotics, hydrate heavily and barely drink coffee anymore. But i think most notably is I stopped taking birth control. My partner (who has given me bv before as states) is infertile so I've been letting him cum in me usually when I'm on my period and i wouldnt get bv, but i just figured the blood was acting as a coating. Anyways, ive been letting him cum in me anytime during my cycle for the last two months since stopping birth control and I am just FLOORED. No bv! no metrogel as aftercare either once in the past two months. I dont want to jinx myself but I'm really reeeaallyyyy astounded. Like many, i had pretty much given up and accepted my fate. I wasn't actually expecting anything to change once i got off birth control because I was getting off it due to depression.

Anyways, i havent really seen anyone mention how birth control could be a cause/fix to bv so I just wanted to share in case this can help someone.

I mean, today has been... a day. Kind of starting to feel crazy again, but you know, I‚Äôll get into it.

As for if my manager ever updated me on anything the guy did yesterday‚Ä¶ No? I mean she did text me about him today, but I‚Äôll talk about that in a second. So I guess after I checked him into his room, he just stayed there all day.¬†

We have a passdown system here, so basically we have a log where we put all our notes for the day, including things like strange behaviors from guests. Usually it looks something like this:

**\[ROOM NUMBER\] - guest had issues using the shower. Work order entered.**¬†

Or:

**Cops were called on lady in lobby, lady did not have a reservation and refused to leave. She is trespassed, if she shows up again, call cops. \[DESCRIPTION OF GUEST\].**

I think you get the idea. They are usually pretty short and sweet. There really isn‚Äôt a need to gum it up with information that doesn‚Äôt really matter. I was reading the passdowns from our overnight girl this morning though and it was a bit longer than her usual entries. I copied it here for you guys (a bit redacted, sorry, privacy policy stuff):

**\[ROOM NUMBER\] - Mr. \[GUEST LAST NAME\] was in the lobby for a while last night. I asked if he needed help for anything but he said he was fine. I asked for his room number to make sure he was staying with us (he is). Called \[SECURITY GUARDS NAME\] and asked him to stand up at the desk with me. Mr. \[GUEST LAST NAME\] went back to his room once \[SECURITY GUARD\] got here. Got a call from his room too, but I think his phone is broken. (\[OP\], can you have \[MAINTENANCE\] check it out in the morning?).**¬†

I read it after she clocked out so I wasn‚Äôt able to ask her more about the phone thing, like if she felt the weird breathing thing that I did yesterday.¬†

There weren‚Äôt any other notes about him in our passdowns, but one of my housekeeping girls today did text me saying that when she went to give him room service he was really weird. The thing about that is, the room has to be vacated for someone to do housekeeping. It's a safety policy thing. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve read it, but basically it‚Äôs for the safety of our housekeepers. Well, Mr. Weird was in the room while she was cleaning.¬†

I‚Äôll copy our texts here so you can see what she had to deal with. (Also, sorry but another note here. She doesn‚Äôt speak English, and I don‚Äôt speak Spanish, so our texts back and forth can read a little weird. We are just doing rounds of google translate to the other person's language and it doesn‚Äôt always go well.)

\[Housekeeper\] - Our guest in \[ROOM NUMBER\] is strange.

\[Me\] ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - Yes! I noticed yesterday at check in! How did he behave with you?

\[Housekeeper\] - He is standing in the room as I cleaned. He watched me as I cleaned.

\[Me\] ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - Ew! I‚Äôm so sorry! \[long apology about the situation\] He didn‚Äôt do anything else¬†

though? Just looked?

\[Housekeeper\] - He only looked as I cleaned.¬†

\[Me\] ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - I‚Äôm so sorry.¬†

\[Housekeeper\] - It is okay! I won‚Äôt enter that room again.

Then a bit of time passed, maybe 5 minutes?

\[Housekeeper\] - Can I tell you something about \[ROOM NUMBER\]?¬†

\[Me\] ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - Yes

\[Housekeeper\] - I left his room and I hear him talking. He sounds behind me.¬†

\[Me\] ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - He sounds like he is standing behind you?

\[Housekeeper\] - yes

\[Me\] ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - Do not go near his room again.¬†

\[Housekeeper\] - ok

I‚Äôm pretty sure she got an early lunch, and my housekeeping manager came down to talk to me about it. I told her what I knew, which isn‚Äôt a lot. That, apparently, he had requested housekeeping (but I really can‚Äôt find any notes about this literally anywhere), she had gone to the room and entered, then texted me that he was in the room when she was cleaning. I want to double down that the housekeeper that went in is 100% not the type to do that. All the housekeepers know not to go in the room if someone is in there, but her especially. So now I‚Äôm thinking, like, what did he say or do to get her in the room?¬†

The housekeeping manager said something about going up to tell him we would not be cleaning the room if he was in it, but he‚Äôs set to check out tomorrow so it shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal. I just told her we shouldn‚Äôt send anyone up to that room alone, but she thinks I‚Äôm being a bit dramatic about it. But I never got a message from her saying she went up there to tell him anything so maybe she decided against it.¬†

So about my manager's text. She sent it to me like halfway through my shift (it was actually during my lunch break), and it‚Äôs not all that weird on its own but, you know. In addition to everything else, it's pretty weird. She texted me and asked if he‚Äôd called the desk again. And obviously I was confused because she didn‚Äôt have anything in her notes about him being weird and calling the desk. I‚Äôll copy these messages as well for you:

\[Manager\] - Did \[ROOM NUMBER\] call the desk again today?

\[Me\]¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - Not yet. Why?

\[Manager\] - He kept calling last night, and I know he called during \[OVERNIGHT GIRL\]‚Äôs shift¬†

too.¬†

\[Me\]¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - Oh, well he hasn‚Äôt called again.¬†

\[Me\]¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - Did he say anything weird?

\[Manager\] - On the phone?

\[Me\]¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - Yeah

\[Manager\] - No, I think the phone in that room is broken.

\[Me\]¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - Did he say anything on the phone?

\[Manager\] - No, I think it‚Äôs the phone in that room. We just need to go in and change it. I texted¬†

\[MAINTENANCE\] about it and he said he would check it out.¬†

\[Me\]¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - I‚Äôm going to tell him not to enter the room if the guest is in there. \[GUEST NAME\]¬†

really creeped me out last night, and \[HOUSEKEEPER\] too this morning.¬†

\[Manager\] - Just let me know if \[MAINTENANCE\] can fix the phone when he‚Äôs done. Text me if¬†

anything weird happens.¬†

I mean guys, I don‚Äôt know but this phone thing is really bothering me. Like really really bothering me because I checked the call logs and he called the front desk like 32 times. It looked like twice an hour every hour from around 3pm ish till 6am ish. That is crazy right?? I‚Äôm not crazy for thinking that's crazy? No one tried to call back and tell him to stop? No one went up to the room to tell him to stop? Because there is no way that 32 times is an issue with the phone. I mean unless some techy person on here can tell me some super obscure way that causes phones to call one specific number over and over again like that. I don‚Äôt know, I feel like it's really weird.¬†

Anyway, this is the most exciting part. I‚Äôm sorry it took so long, these other things were just a bit too weird to not include them. I saw him again.¬†

So I was going back to the kitchen to refill the coffee, and it was like almost the end of my shift so I was sort of losing hope that I was going to see him today. So I fill the little coffee container, and walk back up to the desk, and turn the corner. Who do I see? Mr. Weird standing right in front of the coffee station.

He wasn‚Äôt making coffee or anything, just looking at it. So I walked up beside him and tried to talk to him. Kind of went something like this.¬†

‚ÄúHello Mr. \[LAST NAME\], do you mind moving over just a bit so I can set down some fresh coffee for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúFresh?‚Äù Which is the first question I‚Äôve heard him ask. Yesterday when he came to make the reservation to begin with he just said ‚ÄòI need a room‚Äô or something like that. I don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôm reading into it too much.¬†

‚ÄúYes Mr. \[LAST NAME\]. I just roasted a new pot of coffee, so I just went to the back to refill it here.‚Äù

And this whole time I was trying to like, observe him without making it obvious. A couple of comments yesterday made me think that I should like, maybe try to see if there is something off about him, looks wise.¬†

So another baby interlude here, when you are behind the desk and helping someone out, it's hard to fully realize the scope of how tall someone is. There's just space between you, so it makes a height difference seem less intense. I don‚Äôt know the science or psychology behind it, just know that's how it feels.

So I walk up to the guy, try to get him to scooch over while also trying to see if he looks ‚Äòoff‚Äô somehow, and suddenly I notice that he‚Äôs like Really Tall. I‚Äôm not that short either. I mean, I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô8 but this guy is dwarfing me. Not like, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs 6ft omg!‚Äù but like, ‚ÄúThis is freakishly tall and I have no idea how I didn‚Äôt notice yesterday‚Äù kind of tall. I don‚Äôt think it helps that he was standing so straight, like he had a rod up his back or something. It was freaky.¬†

And then, he looked at me, which he was not doing before and I fucking felt his eyes in my skin again. I‚Äôm sorry, I tried to keep cursing out of the post, mostly because it‚Äôs not really necessary but oh my god. I swear, I could feel his eyes in my skin.¬†

I‚Ä¶ I really don‚Äôt know what else to say. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. He was just‚Ä¶ Looking At Me. Staring at me. I really don‚Äôt even have words close enough for how it felt when he looked at me. I felt so bad, did my housekeeper feel like this? Like, guys, did I somehow, inadvertently, send my poor housekeeper into this fucking guy‚Äôs room???? Because this staring is just‚Ä¶ it feels awful. I feel awful. Like sick or something I don‚Äôt know. Like when you are so anxious you start to feel sick, even if nothing is really happening. That‚Äôs kind of, a little bit like what being watched by this guy felt like. Sort of.¬†

The really unfortunate thing is that his‚Ä¶ fucking staring, god christ it was awful, sort of distracted me from trying to notice much else about him. I know I had mentioned in one comment that I would try to see if he looked as normal as I remember him and I really couldn‚Äôt tell you. I kind of felt‚Ä¶ frozen. Or maybe more, paused? Like I couldn‚Äôt get myself to move. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs really hard to describe. Maybe it‚Äôs just fight or flight (or freeze).¬†

Anyway, he stopped looking at me eventually. I set up the coffee for him, and like, apologized for staring (I kind of was staring at him), then went to hide in the back office.¬†

Saying I was recovering from him staring at me sounds a little stupid, but hey that's what I was doing. So I sat in the back and watched on the camera monitor. I‚Äôll do that sometimes if I‚Äôm really not in the mood to be at the desk or if it's really slow.¬†

Well anyway, there he was on the camera. Standing in front of the coffee station, the funny thing is, he did not look as tall as he felt. He looked tall but not freakishly tall. Maybe my anxiety was warping the height in my brain or something.¬†

There really isn‚Äôt much more to tell you from there that isn‚Äôt the same as yesterday. I was looking at the camera, there was some camera fuzz, I looked under the desk to try and see if something wasn‚Äôt plugged in properly, and by the time I looked up, the guy was gone. The coffee station was messed up too. Like, coffee all over the table, coffee cups half filled, sugar packets kind of, everywhere. A huge mess that I had to clean in the last like, 30 minutes of my shift. So that‚Äôs cool.¬†

I looked back in the camera recordings again for when he was in the lobby before I hid in the back. It sort of just looked like we were having a staring contest when he was looking at me. He didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ move or anything. I kinda didn‚Äôt either. Looking at it from that perspective kind of tripped me out, I don‚Äôt know. On the camera it sort of looks pretty normal. Apart from having a staring contest.¬†

I didn‚Äôt tell my manager about it, I just wanted to get home and type this all up so I can get it off my chest. I also told the agent following me to text me if literally anything weird happened with him. Anything at all. Hopefully he doesn‚Äôt freak her out.¬†

Also a couple of notes for some of the comments.¬†

1. The only thing reported missing was a set of car keys that ended up being found later in the guest's room. I also didn‚Äôt notice anything missing from the desk, and housekeeping didn‚Äôt mention anything missing either.¬†
2. The only other ‚Äòdisappearing act‚Äô situation that happened with him today (so far) was him being in the lobby and then being gone, but that could have been the camera malfunctioning, and also I was away from the desk to fill the coffee containers so he could have just walked up like normal.
3. I haven‚Äôt rewatched the ‚Äòmen in black‚Äô episode of unsolved mysteries/buzzfeed unsolved yet. Felt like just coming home, changing into pajamas, and watching tiktoks in bed for a bit.¬†

Again, if any other front desk agents or anyone has dealt with this guy or someone like him, some help or advice would be really appreciated. He should be checking out tomorrow so I will update you if anything happens at that time. Hopefully not though.",5,1738452240.0,nosleep,1,0.86,False

I (mid-40s F) have had a lifelong tumultuous relationship with my father (70s M). He‚Äôs a narcissist who was verbally, emotionally, and sexually abusive when I was growing up. He always had power and money, so no one ever held him accountable. I moved out at 17 to escape, but over the years, we maintained sporadic phone contact, which increased after I got married and had kids. The distance made me fool myself into thinking he had changed.

For years, he talked about moving to my town after retirement. In 2018, a house across the street from me came up for sale, and I helped him purchase it (in my and my husband‚Äôs name) because he claimed another mortgage would hurt his credit. He made the down payment and paid for a while, but then, when I went no contact in 2020 over his behavior, he stopped paying out of spite. So we rented it out.

Fast forward to 2022, he said he wanted the renters out, so he could move in, and he would resume making the payments. Two years later in 2024, after he still hadn‚Äôt moved, he convinced my husband and me to take our vacation to Texas to move him, promising to pay for movers. But when we arrived, he backtracked, making us do everything‚Äîpacking, cleaning his hoarder-level mess, and driving him cross-country. He never compensated us, despite dangling offers of $50K and other empty promises.

Once he moved in, I spent my entire summer unpacking and organizing his hoard. I arranged for a biweekly cleaner (which he agreed to), and he had dinner at my house every night. He also promised to cover every other grocery trip and let me use his gas card as a ‚Äúthank you‚Äù for being his chauffeur. But, as expected, he slowly started pulling back on these promises.

Then came the breaking point. He started complaining about the cleaner and insisted my teenage sons replace her. I refused. This led to a huge argument, followed by a nasty email from him. I responded diplomatically, and he doubled down with an even nastier one. That was it‚ÄîI cut him off. No more dinners, no more chauffeuring, no more financial entanglements. I told him if he wanted to fix things, he needed to give a sincere apology and put everything in writing.

Instead, he sulked for months. As the holidays approached, he realized I wasn‚Äôt backing down. Cue the fake apology: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way.‚Äù Not good enough. Meanwhile, I had left some of my artwork and refinished furniture in his house (with his approval) since it was for sale. When some pieces sold and my husband went to retrieve them, my father claimed they were his, that I had ‚Äúgiven them to him‚Äù (I hadn‚Äôt).

So, as a co-owner of the house, I used my key when he wasn‚Äôt home and took back my property. He didn‚Äôt even notice until Christmas Day‚Äîwhen he blew up my husband‚Äôs phone with over 17 texts and multiple voicemails, accusing me of burglary. Then he actually called the cops on me, hoping I‚Äôd be arrested in front of my kids on Christmas. The officer immediately saw through him and basically said there was no case, but he promised to humor my dad by asking me to return the artwork. I refused.

Since that didn‚Äôt work, my dad then pulled another stunt‚Äîcutting me off from extended family. He somehow got my uncle and aunt to send a cold, formal email stating they wanted ‚Äúradio silence‚Äù about anything between him and me.

The real kicker? At first, my husband refused to cut my dad off. He would still take him coffee and helps him with things, which made my dad believe he had an ally. I told my husband that this makes my father think he‚Äôs ‚Äúwinning‚Äù and that he‚Äôs in the right, but my husband insisted he‚Äôs just ‚Äúbeing neutral.‚Äù My husband finally saw the light when my dad tried to have me arrested on Christmas Day, and has since gone very low contact. 

At this point, I‚Äôm officially no contact. But some family members say I should just suck it up because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs old and not doing great‚Äù and ‚Äúfamily is family.‚Äù My husband still thinks I‚Äôm being too extreme. So, AITA for going completely no contact with my father after everything he put me through?

I stacked with a low dose of reta for a few months, but I was feeling so tired & foggy & weak, I stopped the stack. I saw my doc several times during all that but she had no answers - just wanted to send me for expensive testing. 

I finally went to a naturopath & laid out my symptoms. He asked if I'd ever monitored my glucose. I had not. He told me to buy a $20 one on Amazon & test 3-4 times a day, eat more frequent meals, and raise my daily calories and carb percentage. He said if I can't get it to rise to normal within 15 mins of eating berries or toast or something, ""eat a fricken Jolly Rancher!"" :-D  He nailed it - my glucose levels were regularly in the 50s & 60s. I think the combination of lowering the GLP-1 dose (stopping the reta) and becoming more aware of symptoms and monitoring blood sugar reguarly has minimized or eliminated all my previous symptoms. 

When I reported this back to my regular doc, she said any episode of low blood sugar is dangerous, and she wanted me to stop the GLP-1 meds entirely. 

Ok,

1. GLP-1 meds have a very low chance of causing hypoglycemia, and I've read many anecdotal reports of it actually resolving it in people who are prone to it. 

2. She has seen all my lab numbers get better and better and it seems really short-sighted to tell me to stop taking the thing responsible for all those great numbers. Just the rebound weight gain & inflammation could be a huge trauma to my system. 

3. No effin way am I going off tirz.

But just this morning, I was working on taxes and just wasn't able to figure it out. Then I got up to get some more coffee & felt kinda dizzy. I did the glucose check & it was 50. That's supposedly ""dangerously low"". I quickly had toast, OJ, & plain yogurt w/beries and it went up to 130 within about 20 mins. 

So how dangerous IS hypoglycemia really? Is the danger about possibly fainting & hurting myself? Brain damage from lack of glucose? Or what? It seems like when I don't skip breakfast (my bad), I'm fine. I have no idea if I've always had it or if it just showed up recently. Before I lost weight I had a habit of snacking all day, so my blood sugar rarely if ever had a chance to go down. Do you think there's any logic to my doc's warning, or could it be just a blanket fear of GLP-1s? 

Anyone else deal with this and if so, how have you regulated your blood sugar? ",6,1738452042.0,compoundedtirzepatide,7,1.0,False
1ifjbtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1ifjbtr/a_batch_of_erratic_alkemia_reviews/,A batch of erratic Alkemia reviews,"Hello hello. About a month ago I purchased my first batch Alkemia order in a while (two full size and a sample set!) so I've decided to sit around and catalogue my experience of trying them out. I am a devoted Alkemia fan, the house makes up a good chunk of my collection and is miraculously convivial with my skin chemistry (though I have my first chem fluke here). 

Starting off with my full size purchases, which were both rare blind buys for me: 

**Surcie** \- *A sweet confection of affection - heavenly rosewater chiffon, soft jasmine musk, flirty mandarin orange, creamy vanilla, and alluring Egyptian amber*.

It took me a minute to calibrate to this one- in my head reading the notes I expected (for some reason) for it to be quite in-your-face sweet, and it absolutely isn't. I find it to initially go down as a sort of warm, floral musk, with the more gourmand elements slowly coming out with time on my skin. It's one of those scents that doesn't scream any particular note at you- well balanced, evolving and one of the most traditionally 'perfumey' scents I've gotten from Alkemia. Something about it brings to mind the ambient smell of a tearoom in a nice hotel- whiffs of various fancy perfumes muddling in the air with not-too-sweet cakes and the background scent of nice fabrics. Despite that I expected it to be more sweet and less powdery, I really enjoy it and find that it wears well on my skin, though it clings pretty close.

**Raxiera** \- *A golden ray of amber piercing like sunlight through a barn window, illuminated motes of sawdust rising on woody aldehydes, old newspapers, dusty vetiver, orris root, dried leather harnesses and a faint touch of saddlesoap*.

I bought this one on a whim because it's being discontinued, and man am I glad it did. If you, like me, are a fan of aged-y scents I would absolutely snap this one up. I don't know how this smells like 'sun warmed wood' as literally as it does, but it does. Compared to many similar scents I've smelled which lean more towards a dusty, faded quality, this one feels warm and cozy and alive, and reminds me of my time spent wandering sunlit antique stores, pushed down into a bottle. I often worry about vetiver overpowering other notes in scents but you can just get a touch of it here, and it's perfect. 10/10, I'll cherish the bottle

Onto the samples: 

**Apotheosis of the Rose** \- *A riotous bouquet of five species of heirloom roses elevated by rare white lotus, ethereal iris, and vine jasmine trailing over a glorious beauty of white amber, succulent jackfruit, glazed apricots, candied flower petals, absinthe blanche, kotata berries, and blonde woods***.**

I got this sample on impulse, I'm perpetually picky about both rose and jasmine scents but I've been learning that any sort of glazed/cooked fruit scent and any sort of candied flower scent are heavenly to me. That was, absolutely, the right call. This is the most rich, nuanced rose-forward floral I've ever tried from an indie house. This is an unexpected but definite fullsize, especially since it wears down on my skin to a soft, slightly sweet woody incense smell after hours of wear.

**Honored Ghosts** \- *Earl Grey tea, black raspberry creams, rosewater-saffron syrup, cinnamon honey, white amber, and vanilla incense*

This may truly be my first Alkemia skinchem fail after trying 25+ of their scents. This, for some mysterious reason, just screams 'bubblegum'. It does when I first put it on wet, it does for most of its wear time, and by the time it stops being creamy bubblegum the smell is pretty much worn off. It's a shame because in the bottle I get more distinct earl grey, saffron etc., but on my skin? Inexplicably mature smelling bubblegum.

**Caveau des Innocents** \- *Tabac, dark coffee, piquant cloves, rum-soaked pears, candied citron, dark caramel, and star anise bathed in intoxicating swirls of opoponax, labdanum, hashish, benzoin resinoid, vanilla incense, and guaiac wood.*

This goes on as a delicious, gourmand+ wet scent. It's very coffee forward initally, but muddled in a way that leaves a warm, sticky sort of sweetness to the smell. For some reason my brain interprets this as some sort of rich, dark pie at first, and I want to eat it. What it wears down to is a gorgeously complex, resinous medley, rooted beautifully by the tabac note which holds extremely well. I expected to like this one, I didn't expect just how much I would love it. 

**Academy of Pleasure** \- *Red and golden ambers infused with a bottle of fine cognac liqueur, a suede waistcoat hurriedly abandoned on an antique chair, a haphazard tangle of bergamot scented linen sheets, cardamon-hashish coffee, and a cedar lined cigar humidor.*

Where Caveau des Innocents shocked me in how strongly positive I feel about it, this one shocked me in how overarchingly neutral I came away. Wet it goes on too cologne-y for my taste (I blame the Bergamot) but the drydown is a really lovely deep, aged amber smell. Unfortunately my takeaway is that it's just *fine.* The eventual payoff isn't remarkable enough to me to warrant the initial traditional cologne smell on my skin, and while I'll probably use up the sample it'll stop there. 

**Virtue of Desire** \- *A sexy complexity of caramel amber musk, dark patchouli, apricot-rosewater white chocolate truffles, peach brandy, plumeria, coconut sage, Tiare, raspberry cream, and neroli orange flowers.*

Truthfully I'm convinced that this one is going to need some long-term aging to really show it's true colors. Something about it just feels off, like I can't even form a proper opinion on it in the first place. It's nice, I guess? But the notes blur in a way that's more baffling than balanced. The jury is out here for me for now, but I don't think I would FS if it smells so unrested after weeks to do so. 

**Confectionaire** \- *An irresistible allure of heavenly angel food cake, French macarons, vanilla toffees, bergamot-orange tartlets, Cassis liqueur, Coconut orchid, neroli orange blossom, gardenia, santal musk, and caramel amber.*

This was my bonus sample and I knew from reading the notes that it was going to be a little too airy of a gourmand for my taste, which it absolutely is. However, that being said, I am pleasantly surprised by how much I do like it. It's very refreshing and bright smelling, and is one of the only gourmands I've ever smelled that I think I could personally find myself wearing in warm weather. Will I FS? Probably not. Do I recommend it to someone who is more a fan of this sort of profile? Absolutely. 

Last but not least, the monthly Alchemy- **Gilded**. *A golden effervescence of sparkling Blanc de Blancs champagne, green figs, golden quince, vanilla heliotrope, limonette de marrakech, flying wish paper, clove buds, and velvety white musks.*

I knew I wasn't going to care for this month's alchemy, green fig tends to be a doom note for me, but I didn't want to delay my order and so I resolved to at least give it an earnest review before it gets given away. Despite said doom note I actually do really enjoy this, it feels bright and sunshiney, and the clove buds and musk do a really good job of grounding the more acerbic notes. Despite it being well out of my typical wheelhouse I think i would actually keep and wear this if it wasn't for the fig.

The summary:   
Apotheosis of the Rose and Caveau des Innocents are 100% fullsize bound, and if I can find the way to make the latter into some kind of dessert I just might because I need it in my veins ASAP.

I woke up early, made coffee, and set out the anniversary card I bought weeks ago. Ten years married today.

When my wife, Anna, walked into the kitchen, I smiled and slid the card toward her. ‚ÄúHappy anniversary.‚Äù

She looked at it. Then at me.

Then she laughed. ‚ÄúVery funny.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

She smirked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not April Fool‚Äôs, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our anniversary, Anna.‚Äù

Her face went blank.

A quiet, unsettling moment passed before she shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not.‚Äù

I chuckled nervously, waiting for her to say she was joking. But she didn‚Äôt.

Instead, she said something that made my stomach drop.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not even married.‚Äù

At first, I thought she was messing with me.

Then I thought she was having a memory lapse. Maybe she was exhausted, overwhelmed.

I pulled out my phone, opened my camera roll.

Wedding photos.

Me in a suit. Her in white. Smiling. Laughing. Rings on our fingers.

I held it up to her. ‚ÄúLook.‚Äù

Her hands trembled as she grabbed the phone. She stared at the pictures, her face tight with confusion.

Then she whispered, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? Of course, you were‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù She looked at me, eyes wild. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember this. I don‚Äôt remember any of this.‚Äù

I grabbed our marriage license. Our framed wedding photo from the shelf. The anniversary gift she gave me last year.

Nothing.

She didn‚Äôt recognize any of it.

And the worst part?

She wasn‚Äôt just confused. She was afraid.

I called her sister.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong with Anna. She doesn‚Äôt remember marrying me.‚Äù

A pause.

Then her sister laughed. ‚ÄúAre you drunk? Anna‚Äôs not married.‚Äù

The words knocked the air from my lungs. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs never been married. You guys broke up years ago. Are you okay?‚Äù

The room spun. My fingers clenched around the phone.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been married for ten years.‚Äù

Silence.

Then, her sister‚Äôs voice dropped to a whisper.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Where are you?‚Äù

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúAt home.‚Äù

Another long pause.

Then:

‚ÄúWhose home?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. I couldn‚Äôt.

Because a creeping, gnawing thought had started to burrow into my brain.

I turned to look at Anna.

She was already backing toward the door, shaking her head, eyes glistening with something between fear and recognition.

Like she had just realized something awful.

Like she had just figured out who I was.

A couple weeks ago I got tasked with training out of the country in the pacific, about 20 hours of flying there, 20 hours back. The training was pretty taxing on my mind and body mimicking that of deployment coupled with the long travel. 

It was 5 days that I was away, when I came back I got rolling into a week of 12 hour shifts at work.

Now here is the big issue of why I am here, I was gone for a week and have been super exhausted after work, I cook for my family and I handle over 80% of the house duties(she just has to load dishes and laundry machines) My wife puts the girls to bed and wakes them up and takes the to and from daycare.

Around lunch, my buddy hit me up and I went to go play cards and she‚Äôs back to being sour at me and yelling at me. My curiosity is am I the issue here? 

Mind you. Week nights I am home about 15 minutes before her so I can prep dinner, and tidy up any chores.

- Different coffee and grind size: I‚Äôve tried universal grind and machine grind from supermarket and custom grind from specialty coffee recommended- all with similar results (I don‚Äôt own a grinder) - several brands;
- tamping pressure

I'm a tea drinker (100%), but when I have guests, most of them are drinking coffee (or at least wanting some coffee). In the beginning, I was using some of those instant coffees, but I know that they are terrible (same with tea; those Lipton teabags are trash). So I was wondering about pour over, I already have a gooseneck kettle with temperature control, and I want to give my guest good coffee.

So several questions:

\- What kind of coffee beans are appreciated by most people? I would like to have at least one normal and one deca  
  
\- I would like a manual grinder since an electric one takes some space and I don't want a machine on my kitchen when I only use it once a week. What do you recommend? (I don't mind spending a bit)  
  
\- I know that I need a philter. Is there any gear that can be washed instead of thrown away?

\- Is there anything else I should know about pour-over?

I think it is basic respect to make an effort for a guest, but I don't want to buy a basic coffee machine with those pads that turn bad after a while and cost an arm and a leg for poor quality. And instant coffee seems to be the worst kind of coffee.

1ifiu9v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ifiu9v,My progress with dut and minox,"I started losing my hair around 17 (in this first photo I was 19y)  I started with just oral finasteride and I had side effects after 3 months, I stopped taking it and tried again 2 more times but I always had sides.
Around the age of 20 I started treatment with a company in Brazil called manual, saw palmetto, oral minoxidil 2.5mg, biotin pills and a green coffee shampoo
My hair continued to get worse but I had never had a beard and after a year I got a full beard probably because of oral minoxidil 
At the age of 21 I decided to try dutasteride .5mg daily, for the first 3 months I had a side effect of a watery sperm but I didn't care much (I no longer have this side effect) 
Now I'm 22y using dut around 10 months also oral minoxidil 2.5mg, biotin, green coffee shampoo and this week I added microneedling and topical minoxidil too
I want to complete 2 years on Dut to have a hair transplant (I'm Norwood 2).

1ifiqjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcousticGuitarReviews/comments/1ifiqjf/enya_electric_guitar_nova_go_sonic_review_is_this/,Enya Electric Guitar Nova Go Sonic review is this carbon fiber guitar worth it?,"I‚Äôve been playing guitars for years, and when I came across the Enya Electric Guitar Nova Go Sonic, I couldn‚Äôt resist testing it. The idea of a carbon fiber body combined with onboard presets and wireless capabilities intrigued me. The Enya Nova Go Sonic (model number B0CTTDFCWR) doesn‚Äôt just look sleek‚Äîit‚Äôs packed with features that make it stand out. But does it live up to its hype? Let me break it all down for you.

The design and build quality of this guitar seriously caught my attention. Crafted entirely from carbon fiber, the Enya Nova Go Sonic feels futuristic and ultra-durable. I‚Äôve taken it to the beach, left it in the car during a hot afternoon, and even knocked it against my coffee table (oops). Not a scratch. The matte black finish is stealthy yet elegant, and I‚Äôve had friends mistake it for a much more expensive instrument. One-piece die-cast construction adds a solid resonance to the body, and the asymmetrical neck profile is a nice touch, especially if you‚Äôre someone who jumps between bar chords and wild solos. It‚Äôs also ridiculously lightweight, making it a joy to carry around.

When it comes to comfort and playability, I realized this guitar was built with the player in mind. The fretboard, made of copper nickel silver alloy, has a unique feel that took me a few sessions to get used to, but once I did, I was hooked. The rounded fret edges and zero fret design make bending strings smooth and effortless. My 13-year-old niece, who‚Äôs just learning, found it easier to play than her older acoustic guitar. The low action and polished frets ensure there‚Äôs no unnecessary strain on your fingers, making it an ideal companion for both beginners and seasoned players.

Sound quality is where things got interesting. The onboard speaker is a game-changer. With 10 watts of power, it‚Äôs perfect for casual practice or small jam sessions. You don‚Äôt need an amp to get started, which means you can pick it up and play anywhere. The presets‚ÄîClean, Overdrive, Crunch, and Lead‚Äîare surprisingly good. I spent hours tweaking these in the Enya Music App, customizing them to my preferred tones. While the Clean preset is crisp and perfect for bluesy riffs, the Crunch preset adds a nice bit of grit for rock solos. However, the Overdrive can sound a bit harsh at times when cranked up. Plugging it into an amp reveals its true potential, as the Alnico 2 and Alnico 5 pickups produce a vintage yet dynamic tone that adapts well to most genres.

**Pros**

* The carbon fiber build is practically indestructible, making it perfect for travel or outdoor use.
* Onboard speaker eliminates the hassle of carrying extra equipment.
* The Enya Music App allows customization of presets, offering versatility.
* Lightweight and ergonomic design suits long playing sessions.
* The fretboard and zero fret design enhance playability significantly.

**Cons**

* Some onboard effects, like delay, feel underwhelming compared to external pedals.
* The carbon fiber neck adds some flexibility, which might not suit everyone‚Äôs playing style.
* Built-in speaker isn‚Äôt loud enough for group performances or larger settings.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to traditional electric guitars in this price range, the Enya Nova Go Sonic outshines competitors like the Squier Affinity Stratocaster in terms of innovation and portability. While the Squier offers a more traditional feel and sound, it lacks the onboard speaker and wireless connectivity that make the Nova Go Sonic so unique. On the other hand, models like the Yamaha Pacifica shine in tonal versatility but fall short when it comes to durability and design. If you‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs rugged, modern, and portable, the Enya Nova Go Sonic is in a league of its own. However, those who prioritize studio-quality sound might lean towards the competition.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The Enya Nova Go Sonic punches well above its weight class for the price. It‚Äôs rare to find a guitar at this price point with such a robust feature set. While it‚Äôs not a replacement for high-end studio guitars, the convenience it offers for practice, travel, and casual performances makes it worth every penny. Considering its durability and the inclusion of a gig bag, charging cable, and onboard presets, it‚Äôs a fantastic deal. You‚Äôll be hard-pressed to find another guitar that combines these features at a similar cost without cutting corners.

Testing out the different features was a breeze. The push-pull volume knob for coil tapping is a nifty addition. It lets you switch the neck pickup configuration to achieve that chimey, Strat-like tone. The USB Type-C port for charging is a nice modern touch, and the OTG recording feature means you can directly record onto an external device. I tried this while layering some tracks for a project, and the quality was impressive. The wireless connectivity, however, is what truly won me over. Playing backing tracks through the speaker created a seamless jamming experience without the clutter of cables.

1ifiqhc,https://v.redd.it/vq5wh2wfxlge1,Can‚Äôt figure out my Dedica,"Hi,
I‚Äôve recently been gifted a DELONGHI Dedica and I‚Äôm truly disappointed in the expresso. I‚Äôm at the point that I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs me or the machine.

Basically the expresso comes out watery, without body or crema. Really underwhelming.

Things I‚Äôve tried:
- Measuring coffee for 1 expresso shot - between 7-9g (7g is super watery - 9g water doesn‚Äôt come out the majority of the time)
- Different coffee and grind size: I‚Äôve tried universal grind and machine grind from supermarket and custom grind from specialty coffee recommended- all with similar results (I don‚Äôt own a grinder) - several brands;
- tamping pressure

Here‚Äôs the water extraction, can someone tell me if this is ok? If not how to improve.

My parents bought a Cecotec and without second guessing the coffee grounds the expresso is 1000x better.

Thanks for anyone that can help.",1,1738450355.0,Delonghidedica,0,1.0,False
