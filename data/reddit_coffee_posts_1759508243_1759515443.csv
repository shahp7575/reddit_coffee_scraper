Wake up, drag myself through work, come home, crash on the couch. On weekends, I barely had the motivation to do anything beyond laundry and scrolling my phone.

I chalked it up to stress, long commutes, and the fact that my diet wasn‚Äôt perfect. I tried coffee (way too much of it, honestly), energy drinks, even those ‚Äúwellness shots‚Äù they sell at the grocery store. Nothing gave me lasting energy ‚Äî just quick boosts followed by even harder crashes.

[One day, my friend Sarah came over and asked if I was okay. She said I looked ‚Äúrun down,‚Äù which hit harder than I expected. That‚Äôs when she told me about this supplement she‚Äôd been using called Moringa Magic. I had never even heard of moringa before, but she said it helped her feel more balanced, like her energy was steady instead of spiking and crashing.](https://freezegluco.com/Moringa.html)

At first, I was skeptical ‚Äî I‚Äôve wasted money on enough ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù products before. But I trusted Sarah enough to give it a try.

The first week, I didn‚Äôt feel much, but by the second week, I noticed I wasn‚Äôt crashing in the afternoons anymore. I could actually get through my workday without chugging three cups of coffee. By week three, I realized I was coming home with enough energy to cook dinner and even take evening walks.

The biggest change? My mood. When you‚Äôre not dragging yourself around all day, everything feels lighter. I didn‚Äôt snap at my partner as much, I felt more patient, and weekends actually became fun again instead of just recovery time.

I‚Äôm not saying it turned me into some superhuman, but it honestly made me feel like myself again ‚Äî and that‚Äôs something I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time.",1,1759515152.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

My top set are coming in fine. I was told they could be removed as I was clamping my cheeks between my jaws but that's stopped since August so I'll likely not need the top set removed anymore.
My bottom however, both *were* coming in well, but due to crowding they've sort of twisted themselves in a diagonal position and they press on the molar beside. 

I also earn my wage by being a cleaner, so I'm very active each day of the week, and ofc this means an increase in my blood pressure. 

The primary issue with my bottom set is that both are impacted they may have rooted themselves inside some important nerves in my jaw so I had to get a cone beam ct x-ray to know if they are. I had that done on Tuesday so I'm just waiting on word back now.

If that is the case and one of them are in those nerves then they can only take the crown and neck away, leaving the root intact, should I still book the surgery date off work? 
My tasks aren't always consistent either, there's the usual daily stuff to get, then depending on the day I could have extra bin requirements or extra floor scrubbings, scuff and rubber marks on wall corners etc, some days can be much more than the previous if the staff haven't been careful with coffee cups for example. So I am on the go for my whole shift, and my commute to and from is walking.

I'm just a little worried if I go to work after the surgery could I delay the healing or risk extra bleeding due to the blood pressure increase? 

How likely is it that would happen if i attend?

As a bit of context for the Parker family, Ben/May are around, Teresa is Peter's older sister by 8 years, and Mary (Peter/Teresa's mom) is alive, while Richard is long dead due to an incident/accident (no cover up/assassination plot)

What if Mary Parker was still alive? would she live with Ben/May alongside Peter/Teresa, helping out every now and then? or would Peter/Mary/Teresa live in a separate household?

i know that Mary/Richard were also former SHIELD agents, so if Mary's a former agent as a data analyst, how would it work if she were to open up a coffee shop/bakery to settle down for a bit of normalcy/wholesomeness? and if she were to do so, what could the name of such a shop be?

and what could her dynamics with Peter/Teresa/Ben/May work out as well?

I unfortunately can no longer afford living in a one bedroom apartment, so I am looking for a roommate. I have kind of a unique situation - I am looking for someone that would be interested in joining me in a 2 bedroom in my current complex, Creekside Apartments on E Cherry Creek S Drive. 

My current lease isn't up until June 1st, but I would be able to transfer to a 2 bedroom now or soon. I really love living here. It's safe, convenient for errands/groceries, and is right across from the Cherry Creek trail. The pool area and leasing office were renovated this summer and it turned out really nice. The complex also has secure indoor mailboxes and package lockers.

About me - I am a 33 year old queer woman. I am kind and quiet and considerate. I am autistic, so I value honest and direct communication. I like painting, collecting oddities, watching netflix & youtube, playing video games, and board game nights with friends. I have an orange cat named Duck, and I'm hoping to get a dog sometime next year, as my beloved corgi Charlie passed at the end of May. This complex allows a max of 2 pets I believe, so I'd need someone who does not have pets. (That being said the complex is pretty lenient about this, but I still would not want to risk it.)

I work as a Case Manager and work a hybrid schedule with 2 days working from home per week. A bonus since I already live here is potential roommates could come and see what an actual apartment looks like. Some of the 2 bedrooms now even have in-unit washer/dryers. If the unit does not have these, there are multiple laundry rooms in the complex.

Current available 2 bedrooms are priced at $1682 and $1836. Rent does vary depending on the time of year and tends to be highest for summer move-ins. I'd like to keep total rent under $2,000.

I don't want to start using meth to keep my job, which is laughable honestly, but I don't know what else to do. I've tried coffee, matcha, lion's mane, ashwaganda, kratom, energy drinks, wellbutrin, and I've even been taking Adderall for ADHD for like a year. I tried some things during Covid and know 3-MMC (as well as some other similar RCs: 3-FPM, 2-FA? I think...I can't remember. We probably tried like 10 stimulant types.) and meth work for energy and cocaine does not. I'd rather have 3-MMC a million times over meth, but it seems unsourceable, until they get it approved as a medication. In my experience with my body chemistry, it was a far better chemical both at functional and recreational doses. I wish I understood what it did that meth and cocaine do not. Maybe I could find a bunch of supplements to cause the same effects...But I have not been able to figure that out from research. If anyone has a chemistry/pharmacology background and knows more about their differences: Methamphetamine (C10H15N) 3-Methylmethcathinone (C11H15NO)

I only took meth like 3 times. It works, but as someone with ADHD, I don't get the same effects as others. I'm sure if I took higher doses, I would deal with similar issues. I'm not trying to imply I'm better than anyone or safe from addiction. Regardless, between the stigma of it, the real dangers with it being unregulated and often laced, it not exactly being a risk-free thing to acquire, and the high potential for addiction when using it regularly, I'd really rather take something else that worked. 

I've basically stopped doing anything besides work and sleep. I even stopped working second jobs and mostly just sleep on weekends. That on its own is making me feel depressed and like everything is pointless. I'm not even showering or eating on a regular schedule. Sometimes I eat a bunch others hardly at all. So adding in a gym routine because it will give me more energy, just isn't feasible until I've increased the baseline at least somewhat. I want to get in the gym though, so I'm planning to add it into the mix, but I can't even get there rn. I shouldn't be this tired in my 30s, and it shouldn't be considered ""normal"". I can't imagine even being alive at 45, with how little energy I have now. I'm exhausted all the time and sleeping through 8-12 alarms for work. I even got a shock watch and slept through it. I'm also having memory issues, but idk if that's just from being so tired or its own symptom. I used to be able to take a 20-minute nap and go into a second job...it feels hard to even talk about because people just think you're lazy.

1nx6k26,https://www.reddit.com/r/MasterPCreviews/comments/1nx6k26/reveal_the_best_computer_headset_jabra_evolve2_30/,Reveal the Best Computer Headset Jabra Evolve2 30 SE Worth It,"Testing out the Jabra Evolve2 30 SE was quite the journey, especially for someone who relies on a solid headset for work and occasional leisure activities. I've been using it daily over the past few weeks, and while there‚Äôs a lot to appreciate, it‚Äôs not without its quirks. Here's my take on this on-ear business headset.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, the first thing I noticed was how lightweight the headset is. At just 4.4 ounces, it feels barely there, which made it perfect for long meetings. The memory foam ear cushions are soft, and they do a commendable job of balancing comfort with breathability. Though the headband didn‚Äôt scream luxury and felt a bit plasticky, it‚Äôs surprisingly durable. It‚Äôs evident Jabra prioritized functionality over flashy aesthetics for this model. For someone like me, who hops from one Zoom call to another, the ergonomic design proved to be a major plus. My ears never felt squished, even after wearing this headset for three hours straight.

**Call Quality and Noise Isolation**  
What really stood out to me was the noise cancellation technology. Technically speaking, it‚Äôs ""passive"" noise cancellation, not the active kind you'd find in some pricier headsets. Yet, the noise-isolating design performed exceptionally well in suppressing pesky background noises. Trust me, with two dogs barking in the background, this feature was like having a personal soundproof booth. The two-microphone setup, paired with the boom arm, ensures crystal-clear audio, even on calls with coworkers who speak softly or mumble. I found myself actually enjoying the ease of communicating during meetings, unlike with other headsets I‚Äôve used in the past.

**Key Benefits**  
- Memory foam ear cushions provide comfort for extended wear.  
- Clear audio output, making it great for business calls and general use.  
- Lightweight design is ideal for long-duration use.  

[Check Jabra 23189-999-979 price on Amazon.](https://ultimateprinter.com/p/b0c7h1hrmx/)  

**Usability and Features**  
Plug-and-play functionality? Absolutely. I appreciated not having to scratch my head over a complicated setup. This headset connects via USB-A, and I had it working on my laptop in under two minutes. It‚Äôs also Microsoft Teams certified, so you get a dedicated Teams button. For someone whose job revolves around Teams meetings, this was a small but impactful addition. If you‚Äôre not a Teams user, it works equally well with Zoom and other collaboration tools. There‚Äôs also a Busylight feature that can automatically indicate when you‚Äôre on a call‚Äîthough I often manually activated it to ward off interruptions.

Here‚Äôs where the simplicity truly shines: there‚Äôs no charging involved. The wired design eliminates concerns about battery life, which is fantastic for someone like me who forgets to charge things. However, for those who enjoy the freedom of wireless gear, this might feel like a limitation.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Plastic materials might not appeal to users craving a more premium feel.  
- Limited to USB-A; it doesn‚Äôt cater to devices needing USB-C natively.  
- Not water-resistant, so avoid coffee spills!  

**Performance During Daily Use**  
From conference calls to casual music listening, the sound quality was pretty decent. Don‚Äôt expect booming bass or next-level audio clarity suited for audiophiles‚Äîthis headset is tailored for clear speech-focused audio. Despite the lack of advanced audio tuning features, it performed consistently well for what it was designed to do. I tested it with everything from casual Spotify playlists to lengthy seminars, and I had no difficulty following every word spoken.

The dynamic drivers offer a 20 KHz frequency response, which is standard. While the lack of customizable EQ settings might deter audio pros, this is nitpicking for an otherwise reliable device.

**Product Contenders**  
Compared to my old Logitech H390, the Evolve2 30 SE unquestionably wins in terms of comfort. The memory foam ear cushions were a lifesaver during a grueling three-hour webinar, which had me reaching for Advil when using other headsets. However, the Logitech H390 edges ahead in sound sharpness for multimedia use. As for the Plantronics Voyager 5200, while it boasts active noise cancellation and wireless capabilities, it‚Äôs double the price tag. If your main goal is workplace efficiency and not audiophile-grade quality, the Evolve2 30 SE is a solid value for its cost.

**Smart Spending**  
From my perspective, this headset offers an impressive price-to-quality ratio. It doesn‚Äôt have the frills of more expensive headsets, but it covers the essentials incredibly well. For professionals looking for an inexpensive yet efficient tool, it ticks all the right boxes. You get premium call quality, a ridiculously comfortable design, and zero setup hassles‚Äîall without burning a hole in your wallet.

I‚Äôve been teaching Mandarin for about 2 years now, and I‚Äôm also a learner myself ‚Äî currently studying Spanish. Since I‚Äôve been on both sides, I try to bring together what works for me as a student and what resonates with my own students.

Here are a few things that have worked really well for me:

üîë¬†**Keep lessons focused**: Pick 1‚Äì2 clear objectives per session. Students retain more when they walk away with something practical they can apply right away.

üó£¬†**Practice real-life scenarios**: Ordering coffee, buying train tickets, or introducing yourself at a party makes practice both fun and memorable.

üåç¬†**Weave in culture**: Students love learning the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind language ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs why Chinese people say ‚ÄúHave you eaten?‚Äù as a greeting, or why certain Spanish phrases are only used in specific regions. Cultural context makes the language stick.

üí°¬†**Leverage online tools**: I like using this free app called¬†*Leyo*¬†to build custom lesson plans. My students can practice exercises between sessions, and it helps me focus our class time on conversations tailored to their chosen scenarios. It also works across many languages, so I even use it for my Spanish learning.

‚úçÔ∏è¬†**Connect learning to daily life**: Journaling, changing your phone‚Äôs language, or using new phrases in a text message can make study time feel more natural.

For me, language learning is most effective when it‚Äôs a mix of structure, culture, and consistent practice. I‚Äôd love to hear ‚Äî what tools or cultural tips do you all use to keep students engaged between lessons?",2,1759514616.0,iTalki,0,1.0,False

TLDR at bottom.

Keep in mind that when both of these things happened I was --not-- checked out of the hotel. It was at a Hilton. And I was booked in a 2 room suite, for just myself.

On the first morning of my stay I passed on maid service since I'd be staying another night. I did discover the in room coffee maker was broken so I let the front desk know, and they said maid service would swap it out. But since I declined maid service I figured they'd swap it out the next morning, which would have been fine. Mid afternoon I needed leave the hotel to run an errand, and it was --well after maid service was done and gone from the halls--. When I came back the coffee maker was replaced. Which was great, but for one, what if I hypothetically WAS still in my hotel room when they came by later and I was just taking a nap in the other room and didn't hear them knock? They risked that and came into my room anyway even though I didn't come open the door? 

Second scenario:
The next morning I decided that I'd go have the hotel's free breakfast, and I made sure to choose a time well before maid service was happening. I also had made sure that I put the ""do not disturb"" tag on the outside of the door handle before I left so that it'd appear I was still in my room, just to make sure no one would be coming into the room while I was stepped out. When I came back from breakfast the tag was on the floor on the inside of my room. No, maid service was not around the halls, no one was around in the halls. Nothing was amiss in my room but I did think that was really weird, but didn't give it much extra thought because I was in a rush to start packing and leave. I didn't end up putting the tag back. I soon left the room again to bring out a few things to my car, and when I came back a few minutes later, my hotel room door was open, the door was being held open by the deadbolt being used to keep it from shutting and locking (hope that makes sense). Maid service still was not running at this point. But there was some sort of staff work cart that was outside my door, I left the lock like that and I just quickly went into my room to grab the rest of my things, then I would go check out. As I came out of the room, there was a male staff member who I guess the cart belonged too and as I was coming out he was about to come in. He apologized and we went our separate ways. Then I went and checked out. And the problems I have with this scenario is some staff member took the tag off my doorknob while I was away and threw it into the room. (The door handles are really angular, so no, it would not have been on an accident by me rubbing against the outside handle and I just not noticing it came off and fell on the floor.) In what instance would a staff member do that, and WHY? In retrospect that ended up making me feel really creeped out. Was someone in my room at that time when I was out? And with whatever that guy was there to do, did they knock to see if I was still in the room? And considering I had not checked out yet, he risked going in any way? Again, what if I was still asleep and didn't hear him knocking? He risked that? Shouldn't whatever he was there to do waited until I was listed as being checked out?? 

So all of that considered, in retrospect the stay ended up making me feel scared, and scared for my things as well since staff kept entering without any heads up. Were they keeping tabs on me of whenever I left my room so that they could quickly go do whatever it was they were set out to do? If so, that makes it all more alarming to me. If it all what happened was legit, what a creepy way of running a hotel. Is all that normal happenstances to expect with any hotel stay, or do I now need to have nagging fears in the back of my mind from now on whenever I am staying at hotels now, whether I'm alone or not? 

TLDR: 2 creepy instances where staff came into my room, outside of maid service, while I was away from my room, with no heads up. When it seems like these things should have waited until I was checked out of the hotel.

As you guys in this sub love to discuss caffeine, I would love to show you¬†**Caffeine Clock 2.0**, a tracker app I made that shows you your caffeine levels now and in the future, helping you¬†**have undisrupted sleep by timing your caffeine better.**

As a guy who drinks a lot of caffeine (like bunch of coffees, energy drink, a bunch of Coke Zero, per day) I wanted to make a good caffeine tracking app for a long time, since nothing I found at the time was sufficient. I wanted to make an app that would be easy to use, show you exactly when you‚Äôd have enough caffeine to not have your sleep disrupted, and could add all the drinks I usually drink, for free.

After several iterations, I am now releasing the second major version of Caffeine Clock, which is the caffeine tracking app I always wanted to build.

**Some highlights of things I consider cool:**

* **Accurate caffeine algorithm**¬†‚Äî able to take the absorption rate and a ‚Äúsipping‚Äù duration into account to actually give you a realistic estimate
* **Comprehensive onboarding**, which (at least I hope) asks relevant questions supported by studies ‚Äî those will set your caffeine half-life and sleep-safe threshold
* **Over 200 drinks in the database**¬†‚Äî or create your own as well
* **Fully offline**¬†‚Äî the data is only on your phone. No login, nothing. You can move the data from phone to phone
* **Analytics**¬†‚Äî including average caffeine consumption, a streak of days where your caffeine amount was good at your bedtime, drinks breakdown, etc.
* **Localized**¬†into five languages (some of them AI-translated; please help me if you find something weird)
* **Free**. It is supported by ads, and there is an option to support the app and remove them.

1nx6ckx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nx6ckx,Amass Mushroom Reserve 030 Gin,"I haven‚Äôt seen Amass‚Äô Mushroom Reserve gin posted here before so here‚Äôs my review!

Mushroom Reserve 030 is a limited-edition release of Amass‚Äô standard dry gin. They take the standard dry gin and age it for 3 months in American oak barrels along with Cacao, Mandarin, Bergamot, and shiitake mushrooms. The resulting spirit is interesting to say the least. 

The aroma is absolutely overflowing with chocolate and orange. The mandarin and bergamot create an orange creamsicle smell, giving it an almost sickly-sweet scent. If you‚Äôve ever had a Terry‚Äôs Chocolate Orange, this smells almost exactly like that.

Taste-wise, it‚Äôs actually thinner than I expected. It‚Äôs not the chocolate-and-orange overload that the aroma suggests. Those flavors are definitely still there, and they‚Äôre mixed in with dark tea notes and the barest hints of the original juniper gin. It is very flavorful but the aroma is just overpowering whereas the taste is much more manageable. It‚Äôs a bit sharp, almost spicy, and there‚Äôs a dark, funky mushroom note that complements the chocolate really well, but it‚Äôs muted in comparison to that and the orange. Based on smell, I would have guessed this was a dessert-style drink ‚Äî but on the palate, it‚Äôs not overly sweet. Think dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate and orange peel instead of orange juice.¬† It‚Äôs sweeter than the gin it‚Äôs made from, but it‚Äôs nowhere near the sweetness of a grand marnier which, surprisingly, is probably the most similar flavor profile to this infused gin. 

Overall, I like this gin for its uniqueness and how well such conflicting flavors go together but I don‚Äôt love it. Mushrooms in spirits might seem odd, but when done properly they‚Äôre very interesting and Amass could have gone a bit further in highlighting them. I was expecting and hoping for it to be more umami forward but this is still a really cool spirit for sharing and also making some interesting negroni/gin old fashioned riffs with chocolate and orange. At $60 I think it‚Äôs acceptably priced for a limited release, but I probably won‚Äôt be restocking it once it‚Äôs finished.

1nx6bpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1nx6bpu/sd_showed_his_true_colors_need_advice_and_a/,SD showed his true colors... need advice and a little support/validation,"Hello it's me, the person who asked about my SD not giving me my $ at our last date... and yes, I am ready for an onslaught of ""I told you so""s, but hoping I can just get maybe some empathy and advice. I think it's pretty obvious what I need to do, but... y'all have been SO helpful and supportive and hoping this will be the same. 

So last week, my SD and I (we have been seeing each other since July, things have been very good) went on a last minute day date to the spa. He never gave me my payment, and I was just really tired and out of it and didn't mention it. I went back and forth on whether to say anything, and really mulled on what everyone here said. Ultimately, I decided that if the chance came to say something I would because I realized that *how* he responded would speak for itself. 

So yesterday we just met up at a hotel, and after being intimate he mentioned he'd left cash and apologized for it all being smaller notes (literally who cares, I guess he was worried about me looking like I had a huge stack of money?). So I kind of was like, ""Cool, no worries. How do you want to handle last week?"" and this is where things devolved. The whole conversation is a bit of a blur because I was truly aghast, so I'll just include the important notes.

* When I initially brought it up, he said, ""Oh I didn't help you last week?"" and I was like, no -- and he said ""well, I don't want to give you $ *every time* because then it's just like, transactional and not as much just natural... I have friends in arrangements and they do this""
* So I respond basically by saying, well that's dating - so do you want to date? Or do you want an arrangement? He said that if I was looking for a relationship (vanilla) that I wouldn't find it with him - fair, I didn't expect to - but that he thought we had fun together and it wasn't so much about $. 
* He quoted me from last week and how I had said that the $ was the 'cherry on top' of getting to spend time with him - so he tried to like, flip that around on me and use it to say that it meant I didn't *care* about it and therefore it was not necessary!? Hard to decipher. What I explained - and what he *pretended not to grasp -* was that my parameter for entering into the bowl was this: if I asked myself, ""would I date this person whether or not $ was involved?"" and the answer was yes, then I would be happy entering into an arrangement -- a hypothetical litmus test. I have explained this before and he actually agreed with it, and now all of a sudden says, ""I don't really understand what you're saying... if that's the case, why is $ so important?""
*  I gently told him that we'd both agreed to an arrangement, with set terms, and one shouldn't set an expectation that they couldn't meet. He then spewed some bullshit about having to put his kid through college and well what if we want to just meet for dinner and coffee am I expected to give you X amount every single time.... like literally yes?
* Then he flipped it around and was like listen I know you need a lot of help, I understand; THIS is where he pissed me off. I recently opened my own business which is doing well. It's obviously a huge investment, and the reason I ventured into the bowl was because I just missed having cash for like, a mani/pedi or getting dinner by myself - I am not in a situation where I was expecting him to support me fully. TO THIS HE RESPONDED: ""Well you don't work"" and I said, ""I do - I own my own business"" and he scoffed and laughed a bit and was like, ""Okay sure, but that means you need a lot of help..."" and I was like, I actually don't? We've paid our bills with revenue every month??? He really disrespected me and kept hitting home that I ""don't work"".
* Then he starts like, counting how many times we've seen each other? And kind of sarcastically saying, Oh so how many do I owe you for? We ended the conversation with him saying okay so then every time we meet you get $, and that's that. 

NOW THIS IS WHERE I REALLY BECOME ENRAGED. As he's leaving, I just casually say ""so do you want to venmo me for last week, or...?"" and he is so dismissive and gestures to the cash on the bureau and is like, ""well I just helped you, it's right there"" and just WALKED OUT THE DOOR. 

I'm processing a lot of feelings. Am I wrong for being so pissed off? I feel so icky and used and just... gross. I obviously need to end it but I'm not sure how, either.

This got me thinking about novels, which are much, much longer. Are there any successful stories with little to no conflict? Even Legends & Lattes had the conflict of setting up the coffee shop.

1nx6b1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nx6b1h/is_a_portable_mug_warmer_ideal_for_pet_owners/,Is a portable mug warmer ideal for pet owners' needs?,"Hey fellow pet parents! I've been wanting to share my experience with something that's completely changed my morning routine, especially as someone who's always juggling between pet care and trying to enjoy a hot cup of coffee.

You know how it goes - you make your coffee, then your cat knocks something over, or your dog suddenly needs to go out. By the time you get back, your drink is cold. It was driving me nuts until I discovered this amazing mug warmer (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) that's been a total game-changer.

What really got me was how perfect it is for pet owners specifically. Let me break down why:

1. It's totally pet-safe. No exposed heating elements or dangerous cords that curious paws could mess with. I was particularly concerned about this with my cat who loves to investigate everything on my desk.

2. The temperature control is fantastic. You can keep your drink at the exact temperature you want, whether it's coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. No more microwaving the same cup multiple times!

3. It's portable, so you can move it around easily when you need to chase after your furry friends or relocate to a different room during playtime.

4. The auto-shutoff feature is a lifesaver. We all know how distracting our pets can be, and sometimes we forget about our drinks entirely. This feature gives me peace of mind.

I've tried several solutions before, like insulated mugs and those fancy smart mugs, but nothing really worked as well as this simple mug warmer. It's also super affordable compared to other options I've tried.

The best part? It's not just for coffee. I use it to keep water warm for mixing pet formula (I foster kittens), and it's perfect for those long gaming sessions or work-from-home days when your pets demand attention right when you've made a fresh drink.

If you're interested in checking it out, here's the link again: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer. I honestly can't recommend it enough, especially if you're like me - constantly multitasking between pet care and trying to enjoy a hot beverage.

One tip though - make sure to place it somewhere your pets can't reach. While it's safe, it's better to keep it away from curious noses and paws, just to be extra careful.

I seriously wish I'd found this sooner. It would have saved me countless trips to the microwave and so many lukewarm cups of coffee. For pet owners who are tired of constantly reheating their drinks, this is definitely worth considering.

Has anyone else tried using a mug warmer? I'd love to hear about your experiences, especially from other pet parents!",1,1759514277.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nx67fz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nx67fz,"Trip Report: Switzerland to Armenia, Taking the High Roads (Summer 2025)","This summer, my partner and I cycled from Switzerland to Armenia over three months, staying on mountain roads to escape the intense summer heat, averaging over 1000m climbing for every 100km. It was a phenomenal trip! We camped every night for the first few weeks until Croatia, from where we stayed at cheap hotels every second or third night in the Balkans and Turkey, then sleeping only in guesthouses in Armenia and Georgia after my mattress failed. In total, we spent around 40 euros per day.

In the Alps, we followed many established cycling routes, starting with the Lakes Route in Switzerland, the Arlberg Pass to Austria, the Claudia Augusta (Reschen Pass) to Italy, the Drau cycle path back to Austria, and then the Alpe-Adria route to Slovenia. From there, we made our own way, designing the route on [Cycle.Travel](http://Cycle.Travel) and Komoot, while following sections of the Eurovelo in Bulgaria. In Turkey, we adapted Route 3 (from the amazing [Cycloscope Turkey](https://cycloscope.net/cycling-turkey/) guide) to Georgia and then made our own way from there (with a few diversions) to Tbilisi and then Yerevan. The roads overall were around 95% paved, with 5% gravel. 

This trip was STEAMING HOT as we rode across heatwaves in Europe and Turkey in July and August, with most days above 30¬∞C, many above 35¬∞C (and some nights at 30¬∞C+ at midnight). To cope, we each carried three litres of water, put on SPF 50 sun cream four times a day, and bought a ton of cold drinks and ice creams along the way and stayed at high altitudes for as long as possible. We didn't really take long breaks during the hottest moments of the day, apart from lunch, which worked out fine, oddly enough. Some surprising things I found on this trip;

* Turkiye is now a surprisingly expensive place to tour (more so than Bulgaria/Serbia/Bosnia) thanks to extreme inflation. Standard meals were on average 10-15 euros each, and budget hotels were 40-50 euros. Strict regulations brought in last year have also removed most Airbnb options from the market, so you're often stuck staying at bad-value hotels outside of big cities.
* Wild camping was most comfortable in Georgia (where it's legal) and the Balkan countryside. In parts of Turkiye, friendly shepherds would often shine their torches on us late at night, and we found it surprisingly difficult to find secluded spots.
* Dogs were most aggressive in Bosnia/Serbia/Kosovo/Georgia rather than Turkiye, but they were never a huge problem apart from a scary encounter with a feral pack on a mountain road surrounding us in Serbia. While we managed to get out and didn't get attacked, it felt worth getting the rabies vaccine beforehand for our peace of mind. 
* Food in Georgia and Armenia was absolutely fantastic (and better than Turkiye in my opinion), with delicious salads, breads and vegetable dishes the norm, especially in guesthouses.
* We both bought two water filters along for this trip, but we didn't need them at all. Along the entire way, there were regularly available clean water fountains or other ways to fill up our bottles, especially in Turkiye. 

**Cycling Highlights (and some lowlights)**

**Austria & Italy (South Tyrol)**: The dedicated cycling routes here were incredible, with the trails either completely separated from cars or on quiet country roads. I was surprised at how much higher quality cycling infrastructure was here compared to parts of Switzerland (where many cycling routes had more extreme inclines and longer diversions, and with Swiss drivers generally a lot less welcoming to cyclists).

**Bulgaria:** The Eurovelo 13 route from around Dospat to near Kardzhali was a pretty stunning mountain road with lots of beautiful towns along the way like Shiroka Laka.

**Turkiye:** Most of the quieter roads in and around Cappadocia were bliss, and the 300km section after where we cycled on very high, hilly mountain roads with little traffic before Elbistan, was absolutely stunning. The section of the D955 from east of Erzurum until Oltu was also truly gorgeous (from there it turned into a busier two-lane road). While nearly all roads (except motorways) in Turkiye are cyclable, with wide, comfortable shoulders and are exceptionally well-built, I found most of these major roads to be quite sterile to cycle. They were typically pretty busy, and tore so deeply into the surrounding environments that it took away their charm. However, it was well worth going inland in Turkiye rather than taking the busier, less beautiful Black Sea route when crossing the country. 

**Georgia & Armenia:** In Georgia, we took a train from Tbilisi west to Zugdidi to cycle along the main mountain road in Svaneti (from Zugdidi to Ushguli and then around to Kutaisi) which was an incredible (and recently paved) route that I can't recommend enough, although with some very big climbs (we did over 2,400 metres in one day there). Cycling in and around the Debed Canyon in Northern Armenia was also a dream, with huge climbs to ancient monasteries and villages with very few foreign tourists.    

*Lowlights:* Busy main roads in Bosnia/Serbia/Kosovo felt very dangerous on a bicycle, with trucks providing little room and drivers passing aggressively. Surprisingly, both the quality of roads and drivers rapidly improved in Bulgaria and Turkiye. The section from the Greek border to Tekirdag in Turkiye was also rather bland, but the other options also seem equally rubbish. 

**Gear report**   
  
**Positives:** *Bicycle: Oxford Bike Works Expedition Disc 700cc.* This was the first multi-month tour I've done on this bike and it worked near perfectly (only needing to replace the chain twice and brake pads, which is to be expected) It's super comfortable, easy to fix in the field and has loads of features like index shifting, a steering stabiliser and a dynamo with lights that make it a joy to ride. 

*MSR Pocket Rocket & Gas Canisters for cooking.* Instead of taking my MSR Whisperlite International, to save weight and to make cooking easier, we took the tiny MSR Pocket Rocket & bought screw-on gas canisters. As they're often hard to find outside of Europe, it was a risk. However, once we hit the Balkans on most days we would go to a restaurant for lunch and often for dinner. We only used the cooker to boil water to make simple dinners and/or coffee in the morning when wild camping. It ended up working perfectly, as we last bought screw-on canisters in Kosovo and they lasted all the way until the end of the trip.

**Mixed:** *Tyres: Schwalbe Marathon Mondial Folding Tire - Evolution, 40mm.* We both used these tyres for the first time (in the past I've only used the more heavy-duty Schwalbe Marathon Plus). We had zero punctures before (and after) Turkiye, but in Turkiye we had 15+ punctures between us on both the front and back tyres, caused by a mixture of goathead thorns and metal wires from discarded tyres on the edge of roads. The punctures were utterly relentless in Turkey (we heard similar experiences from other travellers, too), which made me wish I had used Marathon Plus tyres instead, although they are a lot heavier and more difficult to remove and reinstall when changing inner tubes. For a little more comfort on gravel, I would probably also choose 42mm tyres for my next trip.   
  
**Negative:** *Mattress: Thermarest X Lite NeoAir Mattress (new 2024 edition):* After previously working perfectly, my Thermarest failed after less than 50 total nights use camping, due to multiple small punctures around the winglock valve and deflating rapidly during the night. After fixing an initial puncture near the valve, many others arose and became difficult to repair as I had already used all of the puncture repair spares that came with the kit. Luckily, this was by the time we reached Georgia, and we stayed at low-cost guesthouses for the rest of the trip instead. I'm hoping to get this fixed via the warranty, but it was really frustrating considering the cost of the mattress.

*Sleeping bag: Sea to Summit Spark -1*¬∞*C Sleeping Bag (bought in 2022):* In the intense summer heat, where nights often didn't get colder than 18¬∞C, this bag was a disaster. As it has a half zip to save weight that only zips down to your waist, it's almost impossible to regulate your temperature using it during warm night as your lower body is so warm inside of it. I would start sleeping with either nothing on top or a silk liner during hot nights, then wake up cold at 2-3am, half put on the sleeping bag and then struggle to get back to sleep as my lower body would start sweating. This bag is really not well-suited to summer, and I really regret not buying a quilt for this trip (which my partner had and found to be super useful on hot nights).

Then she pivoted hard into the ""coffee shop"" vibe and renamed it something pretentious with ""& Co."" at the end. She's charging ¬£3.80 for a flat white and ¬£4.20 for a cappuccino. Premium prices for the area.

The coffee is made with a Nespresso Vertuo Pop she got for ¬£99 from Argos and pods that cost about 38p each when bought in bulk. No barista skills needed, just stick in a pod and press a button. She's making ¬£3+ profit per cup after the pod cost.

The irony is she first saw this machine when she came to my house. I've had this machine for yonks and I know that if you stick with the safe options like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Colombia, Mexico and those kind of pods, you just can't go wrong and nobody gonna have a clue.

There's a proper ¬£2k+ commercial espresso machine in the corner, the kind you'd expect in a specialty coffee shop. Customers can barely see it unless they're really looking or go out of their way to look behind the counter.

She bought it broken on purpose. Found it on Facebook Marketplace for dirt cheap and it's purely for aesthetics. It's never worked, it's literally just a prop.

Behind that machine is the Nespresso machine doing all the actual work.

From what she's told me she's selling 170+ cups a day on average. Rough maths says that's ¬£500+ in daily coffee revenue alone (not counting pastries) which is approx \~¬£15k a month just from coffee.

The customers seem to be raving about it on Google reviews.

1nx6582,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nx6582,AIO My fiance is so sensitive,"My fiance and I work together. He is very private and doesn't talk to anyone really. He works in the back, behind the scenes. I'm in the office and the face of customer service. For understanding, I have been hit on a bit from men in the yard ( where he works ). He thinks I am too friendly and flirty. Though I have never taken any guys up on their advances. 
We haven't told anyone at work because it would just create more gossip and things for people to talk about. And again he is very private. Says his work life doesn't need to know about his home life. 
This isn't the first time we have had this discussion. He thinks when I talk to the men in the yard that I'm too friendly. That I should keep to myself. 
So when he asked me for coffee and I was headed to the break room to meet him.. I walked next to my co worker Cade. He is one of the guys who has not tried to ask me out and he is happily married.. he was next to my office fixing something and when I walked but he said ""it's all your fault you broke it"" jokingly and light hearted. And so I responded ""wanna fight!?"" Also just trying to joke around. Literally a 2 second conversation and I walked away.. didn't think anything of it. Because I have always joked around with my co workers. But I didn't realize my fiance was within ear shot and he heard and now is upset with me. I honestly didn't mean a dang thing about it. 
It's exhausting to have to watch what I say at work so much. I try to be respectful to him. He says our American culture is so different from El Salvador and he doesn't understand my mannerisms and why I talk so lightly to other people. That privacy should be most important and I should respect him to not joke around with other men .. 
I have tried to lessen the flirty talk and my mannerisms but sometimes I say something and don't think anything of it and if totally triggers him. ",74,1759513912.0,AmIOverreacting,105,0.96,False
1nx64tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/StillRunning/comments/1nx64tr/if_a_things_sounds_too_good_to_be_true_it_is/,If A Things Sounds Too Good To Be True It Is,"This is a warning to everybody who see's this. One day I met a man. I was at a hotel in the town I lived in and I decided to go to one of the local hotels to look for work. I took a bus to get there and when I arrived, I went to the office. The owner was an Indian man that couldn't talk. They wrote on a chalk board there is no work. I thanked them for the information and left. After I left I knocked on a door where that man was. They opened the door and said you may come in. To be clear I will not use my real name. That is to stay anonymous. Because of that I will use the name George.¬†

I asked the man what their name was. They said Aaron. I said my name is George. You seem to be quite the man Aaron because you are alone here at the hotel. This could be a dangerous place. Aaron answered I am aware of that George. But I am not concerned. We had a long conversation. Eventually I asked that man since you are that type of person would you ever consider disappearing. Also, if you do how would you use the internet and by all means avoid the dark web. After I asked that Aaron said see this coffee mug, this mug came from the dark web. After Aaron said that I felt intrigued. We had a long conversation about the dark web. I left after that and took a bus back to the area where my house was. The next day I thought about what happened.¬†

I am aware of what the dark web is. The dark web is the part of the internet you can‚Äôt get to with the general web browser. You need a TOR browser and you need to be cautious and use common sense. The dark web has illegal porn, disgusting videos, red rooms, and things you are better off never even thinking about. I considered going there again. I decided to and decided to just be cautious and aware to not do a stupid thing. I went to that hotel a few more times and had discussions with that man. One day I went there and asked Aaron if he could explain a few things. Aaron answered Yes, I would not mind. My name is Aaron. I work for a dark web agency as an agent and I am familiar with the dark web from the inside out. I have devices that can access the dark web and have seen things that you would never even imagine. I was thinking DAM. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. What are the chances of that ever happening? I asked Aaron if we could exchange phone numbers. He agreed and I put the name Aaron in my phone and put the number below it. I left the hotel thinking be cautious and use common sense.¬†

Eventually Aaron moved out of the hotel and moved to the countryside of the area we were in. I called Aaron and asked him if we could have a few meetings. Aaron indicated yes, and texted his address and how to get there. I drove there and parked near a trailer park. I walked down the road and saw Aaron lived off grid in a mobile trailer. I knocked on the door and Aaron answered. We sat in the living room area and Aaron explained quite a few things. Aaron said I do jobs for people. It is $200 a job and the way it works is I scan the money and it is transferred into bit coins. That means $200 becomes $200 million in bitcoins. This trailer has an AI called aphes. I am the only person who can hear aphes. I own an organization called the LRA. That stands for liberation resistance army. The LRA runs the dark web that means I own and run the dark web. When I left that day I was thinking Jesus. That is mind blowing. I considered everything and decided to have Aaron do a few jobs. The thing is there are places I am banned from and I was thinking if Aaron did things to change how that place worked I wouldn‚Äôt be banned anymore. The first thing I had to do was save up cash. I set aside a few hundred dollars and I met Aaron on the street to pay him. After the first time I waited to receive a phone call. About one-week later Aaron called and said that man is no longer a part of that organization. I felt amazed. But the thing is that was just one time.¬†

I drove to the trailer park where Aaron lived a few times and paid him to do jobs. Every time I was there Aaron always said I own the LRA. There was times Aaron said there are trillions of members of the URA. We own the world. There was other times Aaron told myself I was in the militray, got shot in the abdomen and my bladder does not work because of that. As time passed, I hired Aaron to do more things. But it was never cheap. One job was $400. There was times Aaron said there is a fee you have to pay to make things stay the way they are. Later Aaron told myself I changed the name of the organization to URA because I don‚Äôt agree with Donald Trump. That stands for Umbrella resistance army. If you are a member of the URA you are a ghost. You have no identity. You don't exist in any database in the entire world. You are invincible. The thing is I believed him. I was thinking. This is¬†amazing. This is incredible. As time passed I had Aaron do more and more jobs. The total amount I spent was unfathomable. One day I went to Aaron‚Äôs trailer again to do one last job. To make things clear when I say do a job, I mean Aaron would make a person get fired from a place, or hack into a database to amend things or do other things. That day I was there Aaron had a bag of m&m‚Äôs. I asked him why he was eating that. They are good food. Aaron answered I own Hershey. All hershey products are healthy. I will explain Jude. Hershey products are healthy. I eat just organic healthy food. Hershey products, are healthy, reese‚Äôs cups are just peanut butter and cocoa, soda is just flavored water, little debbie products are heathy, a u in a circle on a food label means its healthy. But the thing is Aaron was lying. Soda is just carbonated water with artificial flavoring, caffeine, and sugar, hershey products are garbage, little debbie products are garbage, a u in a circle on a food label does not mean the food is healthy. That means the food is koshered that means not made with animals or by animals. But I will get to that idea later.¬†

I paid Aaron to do quite a few things. I was thinking the whole time this is actually happening. I‚Äôm changing the world. However, I noticed that things never changed at all. I went to the internet and saw those people still worked at those places. Rules that were there before were still there. It was as if nothing happened. Eventually Aaron moved again. He was still in the countryside but he lived at a different facility. The thing is Aaron always lived off grid. After Aaron moved that time, he moved to a landlords apartment and lived in a spare room and paid that landlord cash each month to be off grid. At about that time I received a phone call from Aaron. Aaron said Jude you need a URA ID. This ID will give you infinite power. You can drive any vehicle, you can do anything with the ID. Also when you get the ID you will receive a URA uniform, a phone, and a gun from the URA. It will be $200. I informed him that that will never happen ever again. I will purchase the gun, phone, ID, and uniform but never ever hire him to ever do a single thing ever again. I drove to Aaron‚Äôs new place and paid him for the items. I left hoping that would arrive soon. A few months passed. I called Aaron asking where the package was. He never responded. A year passed and I had had enough. I drove to where Aaron lived knocked on the door. Aaron didn‚Äôt answer but a different man answered. I asked him where is Aaron. They answered Aaron moved out. I asked them where. There answer was to a large town about 40 minutes.¬†

A few days later I did more research. I looked online and saw those people were still at those places. Nothing had changed. I decided to get to the bottom of this. There was a neighbor of Aaron‚Äôs who had a son near where I lived. I went to there house and knocked on their door. Their son answered and said what is it George. I answered I have a few questions for you. We discussed Aaron and I found out the truth while I spoke to that man‚Äôs son. I found out from the research I did and from that man‚Äôs son Aaron was a liar. All Aaron does is lie and steal from people. Aaron is not what he says he is. Aaron does not own a company that runs the dark web, Aaron was never in the military, Aaron does not own hershey, everything Aaron told myself was a lie. Every single, solitary thing. I found out Aaron had stole from myself over $4,000. That buffoon never did a single, solitary thing. Everything was a lie. There is no URA literally everything Aaron said was a lie. I found out from that man‚Äôs son that Aaron was nothing but a fat, worthless liar who lived off of SSI. Aaron received SSI because Aaron‚Äôs bladder didn‚Äôt work.¬†

I told that man‚Äôs son I will not get mad or obsess over this. I will bring Aaron to justice and retrieve that cash. A few weeks later I saw the man who had moved to where Aaron had lived in the countryside. He said Jude Aaron moved to Florida. He paid his mother over $900 to drive him to Florida and drive herself back here. I thanked him for the information. Wherever you are Aaron I hope you get what you deserve. I will end this now. I made a mistake. I trusted a liar and that was wrong. Aaron is a worthless piece of garbage. Everything Aaron says is a lie. Every single, solitary thing. When Aaron talks Aaron lies. I will not get mad or dwell on this. I learned and I hope this changes. Aaron is nothing but an out of shape man that lives off of SSI that does nothing but lie and steal from people. I‚Äôm aware Aaron might see this. If you see this Aaron, go to hell you liar, you thief, you¬†monster, you bull. Thank you for listening and letting me be able to cope with this. Also always remember if a thing sounds too good to be true it is. That means it‚Äôs not true, it‚Äôs a lie, its bull, it‚Äôs evil. Never ever do that at any time for any reason imaginable.¬†

I‚Äôm actually really into physical touch, but also quite a chivalrous/respectful guy and because of this, I tend to not make any bodily contacts or physical touches with the girl I‚Äôm seeing for the first time on a date or meet up.

I am unsure, but I feel like I am self sabotaging a lot of my chances for a second date because of this, as I am not reciprocating physical touches from the girl.
I‚Äôve been told in the past that it‚Äôs always nice to ask the girl if they would like to hold hands, especially so if we‚Äôre walking together very closely with arms almost deliberately bumping into each other during slow long walks on a first date (i.e. along the beach/harbour, around a park). I‚Äôve never done this before and I tend to overthink that if I start doing this girls will think I‚Äôm desperate.

I‚Äôve also had many situations when the girl would initiate physical contact first, but still no reciprocation from me. For example, I‚Äôve had quite a lot of instances when we would be chatting about something and in context they would lightly punch or nudge my arm in a playful way, pull my arm towards them, pull at my sleeve, etc. They could possibly do this several times on the date.

With a more recent experience, I went on a coffee date with a girl I met from a dating app that seemed to be quite into physical touch. As she would do playful punches and nudges throughout the night. I thought we had a wonderful night chatting and getting to know each other. She lived nearby and asked me to walk her home after. We both agreed that we had a really good time chatting and mutually would like a second date. We exchanged numbers, she initiated a hug and we said our goodbyes. Despite all this, I receive this message from her the next day:
‚ÄúI wanted to be more upfront with you about last night. I had a great time chatting with you, things went well 100% but I didn't quite feel that romantic spark. I figured it's better to be upfront and honest with you now rather than leading you on.‚Äù

TLDR; So here I am, trying to figure out if I‚Äôve been destroying my chances of second dates this entire time‚Ä¶ Is it bad that I‚Äôm not reciprocating physical touch, if I can clearly see that they are into me?",1,1759513640.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

They're exceptionally mid but really the only choice for a small business coffee shop in that area however, I've eaten my last overcooked, overpriced waffle from them.

They just fired their manager who was there everyday during the week because he didn't agree with how they run the business. Dude was definitely there for at least two years since I started at Penn. He was super cool, always nice and funny. Will definitely be missed by us regulars! I was told they gave him no notice and fired him by email. Totally fucked up in my opinion, but I know I only have one side of the story.

Today, I was talking to a friend of mine about this and she said a year or so ago, she overheard one of the guys (short chubby guy with black hair, black beard and a consistently bad attitude) say that he ""wishes Hinge had a race filter"" so he could filter out women of color..... On their Insta, he claims to be the owner.

This prompted me to look into them more and turns out the owners of Top Hat are super religious, working at a non denominational Christian mega church. The owner of the church posted this:

""Indescribable. I‚Äôm so sorry, Charlie Kirk. Lord have so much grace on the Kirk family. Please pray for \[Turning Point USA\] and all those a part of that community.

They're exceptionally mid but really the only choice for a small business coffee shop in that area however, I've eaten my last overcooked, overpriced waffle from them.

They just fired their manager who was there everyday during the week because he didn't agree with how they run the business. Dude was definitely there for at least two years since I started at Penn. He was super cool, always nice and funny. Will definitely be missed by us regulars! I was told they gave him no notice and fired him by email. Totally fucked up in my opinion, but I know I only have one side of the story.

Today, I was talking to a friend of mine about this and she said a year or so ago, she overheard one of the guys (short chubby guy with black hair, black beard and a consistently bad attitude) say that he ""wishes Hinge had a race filter"" so he could filter out women of color..... On their Insta, he claims to be the owner.

This prompted me to look into them more and turns out the owners of Top Hat are super religious, working at a non denominational Christian mega church. The owner of the church posted this:

""Indescribable. I‚Äôm so sorry, Charlie Kirk. Lord have so much grace on the Kirk family. Please pray for \[Turning Point USA\] and all those a part of that community.

After around four months, nag-away kami and she told me na itigil ko na lang daw yung nararamdaman ko for her. We didn‚Äôt talk for almost a month. Then one day, bigla siyang nag-message, nagkamustahan kami, and she asked if available daw ako para mag-review since sabay kami magte-take ng board exam. So every week, lumalabas kami to review, usually sa coffee shops. After our review sessions, nagyayaya naman siya gumala kasi medyo overload na rin sa review.

During this time, hindi ko na binring up yung panliligaw sa kanya. Then one time, nasa jeep kami pauwi, sabi niya inaantok siya, so ang ginawa ko, inakbayan ko siya HAHAHA. I didn‚Äôt really ask for consent so di ko sure kung okay lang sa kanya. Pero naihatid ko naman siya sa bahay nila and normal pa rin yung conversation namin after.

But yung mutual friend namin na nagsend ng pic, dati pa ako sinasabihan na, ‚ÄòAlam mo ba lumalabas yung dalawa?‚Äô Pero sabi naman ng friend ko na niligawan ko dati na hindi naman sila lumalabas. So maybe lumalabas sila dati bago ako manligaw and nag-stop after.

One time pa nga, kasama ako nung nag-birthday yung supervisor and binigyan namin siya ng regalo. And ang tawag pa rin niya sa kanya ay ‚Äòsir,‚Äô so idk talaga lol. And niyayaya pa nga ako na dalaw daw kami sa pinag-OJT namin. So okay lang sa kanya na makita kami ng supervisor namin dati na magkasama kaming dalawa.

This convo was a few weeks ago na, and I was really mad about it. I didn‚Äôt really confront her. Lumalabas pa rin kami dalawa. Nag-ask ako sa mga kaibigan namin about this and may HAHA react pa nga. Parang ako lang yung nagagalit about it. Pero pinalipas ko na lang and I‚Äôm not mad about it now. I just wanted to know what others would say about the situation. Bakit kailangan pa akong takutin?

I'm using a stainless steel moka and Ground Coffee by Lavazza.i started making it a year ago and really admired how smooth the coffee tasted but wanted to minimise the burnt flavour of it (even though i started appreciating it a bit more now)

I only want to make lattes with my moka pot so i add evaporated milk and sugar to the below recipe after its all done but its wildly off. I used to only use 1 tbsp of coffee grounds which left alot of remaining water in the bottom chamber and uneven extraction but I think i almost preferred that taste because this makes it feel even more burnt.

Recipe:
1. Fill bottom chamber w 150g hot water
2. Pack the funnel with 10g of loose coffee grounds
3. Screw on the top and turn on flame to low heat
4. When coffee STARTS pouring, lower the flame as low as possible
5. When it starts spurting- off flame and run cold water around the base of the moka pot

Ratio coffee to water = 1 : 15

The husband texted my boyfriend saying their daughter wanted to invite him to the zoo.

My boyfriend came to me and asked if we had plans that day. I said no, we had just casually set it aside as a day for the two of us to spend time together. He then said he‚Äôd been invited to the zoo with his friend‚Äôs family, specifically by one of the daughters. 

I asked if that meant I was also invited, and he said he wasn‚Äôt sure. Instead of checking, the conversation turned a little defensive. He said I don‚Äôt usually ‚Äúlet him go places without me,‚Äù which didn‚Äôt sit well because I don‚Äôt feel like I restrict him. He regularly goes out with friends for drinks, bowling, baseball games, etc., and I never go to those. I also do things with my own friends, coffee dates, markets, and my church small group.

To me, this felt different because it‚Äôs a family outing, not a ‚Äúguys‚Äô night.‚Äù I thought it might be a nice chance for me to connect with his friend and their family too. But he compared it to me getting coffee with a friend without him, like it‚Äôs just one of those ‚Äúsolo hangouts.‚Äù

Now it‚Äôs become an argument. He feels like I‚Äôm making it about me not giving him space, and I feel like he‚Äôs not considering that I might also be welcome and that it could help me build a relationship with people who are important to him.

So I‚Äôm stuck wondering:

* Do I expect him to clarify with his friend if I‚Äôm invited too, or is that overstepping?
* Do I just let him go alone and treat it as his time with his friend, even though it‚Äôs technically a family day?
* Any advice on how to better communicate about what‚Äôs a ‚Äútogether‚Äù activity vs. a ‚Äúsolo‚Äù one, so it doesn‚Äôt turn into an argument?

Poured my heart out here as I have nobody to share this with.,"I just got out of a 8 year 'friendzone‚Äô mess with this girl from my school. We were in the same school since kindergarten but couldn't gather enough courage to be friends with her. I had a humongous crush on her ever since I knew her. She is really pretty and is academically sorted too. We talked but mostly about academics. We first met after Class 10 outside the school setting for the first time. We grew to be friends. We went to the same pre-uni college. We played badminton together with our school group, sat next to each other in the bus, watched anime together. She was physically touchy (it was she who initiated touch always and not me) - Holding my hands, resting her hands on mine while sitting next to each other. I'll make it clear; I always intended to date her but was looking for the right time to confess. 

Well then, she was what she calls 'good friends' with a guy from school. He didn‚Äôt study well, wasn‚Äôt fit, a bully in school, bad temperament and clearly madly into her. They spoke a lot, chatted a lot and she was liking the attention and she knew that he was into her. They fought every now and then and then resume being ‚Äòfriends‚Äô. He was possessive about her. He was particular about dropping her home himself and got visibly angry if somebody else did it. That was one of the examples of his toxicity. Textbook definition of a toxic person. And I being the idiot that I am, kinda became the therapist for her unwillingly in the pursuit of dating her. And guys, that is where I fucked up and found a permanent spot in her friendzone palace. She honestly thought that he was a good guy and did all of that because he deeply cared for her. He confessed his feelings and she refused. They cut contact post the confession. After a few days, he went drunk and created a huge scene outside her home with her and her family in it.  This debacle was proof of her skewed definition of a ‚Äòfriendship‚Äô. In actuality, it was an unlabelled situationship that she mistook for a friendship. That guy clearly took advantage of her blurry physical boundaries and touched inappropriately and she passed it off as platonic owing to her wrong definition of a friendship. They didn‚Äôt kiss or anything more but what he was doing was wrong. She was unaware of that. I was head over heels for a person who had experienced a ton of attention and a skewed definition of friendship with boys. Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. I can proudly say that I have respected her physical boundaries through out this friendship of ours because I wanted a genuine life long relationship with her.

It was close to impossible to impress her with the values that I stood for and preserving my self-respect but I persevered. I intended to build a genuine and healthy relationship with her in the long term. I imagined my whole life with her by my side. Our families belonged to the same community and have similar values for life. I have met her family and I find them very relatable. Both of us are younger siblings to older siblings with 8-9 years of difference in age. Our parents are of the same age and heck both our moms share the same name! Our parents have met each other on a few occasions too. All of this made me think that she was the one for me. I made her my whole world and that was a huge blunder. The idea of spending my life with her motivated me to do better in all aspects of my life. She wasn‚Äôt just a part of my life but the idea of her had encroached all parts of my mind. I was very introverted and hence I wasn‚Äôt good at grand gestures. Believe me when I say this, I gifted her a book on her birthday because she was an avid reader and a bar of chocolate and that was the very first gift that I meant to gift somebody out of my own will until then in my whole life. So, in my mind that was a huge step!   

So I finally made up my mind and thought of confessing my feelings for her during the first year of our pre-uni course (late 2018). She was still ‚Äòfriends‚Äô with the bully from school. I did it over text and obviously she rejected it. She used the usual, ‚ÄòI only see you as a friend‚Äô and ‚ÄòI am not into relationships because my family is strict‚Äô cards. I had to do it because I couldn‚Äôt pretend to be just friends anymore. But being the immature self that I was back then, I settled for being friends again out of fear of losing her from my life and possibly another chance in the future. To get a picture of me then, I wasn‚Äôt fit either. I was nerdy, wore spectacles and awkward around girls.

Parallelly, she became friends with another guy from the pre-uni college, let‚Äôs call him X. They were in the same class and I wasn‚Äôt. Honestly speaking, he was probably a good guy but he didn‚Äôt enter her life just to be her friend. And he knew that I was there with the intention of dating her too. But we acted like we didn‚Äôt know that of each other. Her friendship with him grew over time and I was sidelined again. I wasn‚Äôt chatting much after the rejection but we were still travelling together and hung out together with our school group, minus the bully friend obviously. I confronted her about the sidelining and she made it clear that she prioritised him over me as a friend with her words and that I hadn‚Äôt contributed much in her life. She threatened to block me if I was persistent and she did block me too. That was a very strong cue for me to leave but I didn‚Äôt take it. Again. Fuck! I begged her to take me back as a friend. I fucking cried over the phone! As usual, she did agree on the condition that we will only be friends to which I agreed. After this I did not initiate conversations to give her space but we texted every once in a while. We hung out occasionally with our school group. They were not aware of the equation between us.

Our pre-uni ended and I secured a seat in the same university as hers. I was excited at that news. My brother knew about my failed attempt at a relationship with her and I took his advice to join a different university than hers. The same equation of occasional chatting and hanging out with mutual friends continued throughout uni life. I did it to give her some space and gain back her trust. This detail is important because it‚Äôll come back to bite me later. During this time, in her defence, she sounded and behaved much less mean and more welcoming with me. My ‚Äòrival‚Äô X in this fucking soup of my life had joined a different university to hers but they met frequently throughout uni life. There were rumours about them dating among my mutual friends from pre-uni but I didn‚Äôt believe it because she never broke that news in our school group and didn‚Äôt post about it on social media either. I felt right in assuming that because I was part of the few of her friends who were invited to her sister‚Äôs wedding, so I thought we would know it if it was true. In fact, she made believe that I was the first to know about her sister finding a match among our school friends at least. Although if I‚Äôm being honest, I dreaded the news of her being together with somebody else if the rumours were true.

Cut to November 2023, she posted a story on IG of what seemed like a photo of hers in a coffee shop, clicked by X and she openly tagged him. That story was only for the close friends list. This shattered me. I spiralled and went weak in my knees. But I thought alright this doesn‚Äôt mean anything. What an absolute moron I was back then! And then a few days later, X posted a story on IG of just two hands next to each other with Taylor Swift‚Äôs song Lover and I fucking lost it. There was absolutely nothing I could do and I was imploding from where I was sat. I broke down. I got panic attacks and had sleepless nights for many weeks to follow. I stopped texting her, deleted IG and I sat there shattered and depressed. I did get to know that she hid stories with him in it from me. I couldn‚Äôt digest any of this. I decided to get out of it by hitting the gym as suggested by one of my friends and I took it seriously. The gym was my saving grace. I took care of my nutrition. I worked out every single day of the week and physically it paid off very well. I lost around 20 kgs of weight over 6 months, slimmed down to a 30-inch waist from 36 and I looked much better and it showed in my confidence and my sense of self-worth too. If you think the story ends here, nope.

 3-4 months into my no contact stint with her, she and her family noticed me taking a brisk walk from an eatery in our locality. I had a small chat with them and I made my way home. Our homes are 5-6 streets apart. They noticed that I had gotten significantly fitter and her parents actually complimented me for that. I was genuinely stoked with this meeting. I didn‚Äôt intend to meet/speak with her but it just happened. After this meet, she started initiating text conversations on her own. By this time, we had graduated and started working. She was interning in a company. X moved abroad immediately after undergrad to pursue masters. This was around Feb-March 2024. Just the two of us went on walks and swim sessions in the morning in the name of fitness, then grabbed breakfast. I used to pick her up from her home. All of this happened with her parents‚Äô consent. This was the most texting I had done with her in all my years of friendship and a lot of it was initiated by her! It probably wasn‚Äôt a lot in the general sense but in my case, it was the most. Around June 2024, I had invited her for my brother‚Äôs engagement ceremony along with other friends of course. During our conversation there, I casually asked her if she had a boyfriend in her uni days and the answer was NO! I was relieved! After this, her parents were out of country for a month to visit her sister and we were exchanging recipes. I had even cooked something for her in her house during this time. There was nothing NSFW about this meet, I even talked to her parents on video call when I was there. We even went out to grab something for dinner during this time. She told me that I was on her speed dial in case of any emergency. I checked on her regularly through text. Slowly, I was the only one from the school group that she was meeting this frequently. We met every weekend for badminton sessions with other friends and picked/dropped her most of the times because we lived close by. I wasn‚Äôt possessive like the school bully. I didn‚Äôt mind somebody else picking/dropping her even when I was present. When I was on trips with my family she would ask for stories on IG if I didn‚Äôt post any. I love cars and she knows about it too. When she was out on a family trip, she would send pics of fancy cars she found there at her own will. She would watch movies that I suggested. She would watch automotive content that I suggested even though she wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in it. She was a totally different person from when I initially met her. I was really happy with my life then.

Cut to 2025, around July, she texts me about wanting to go on a vacation with our school buddies (the school bully was out of picture now). She approached me first to ask about it. We plan it. Four of us, 2 boys and 2 girls including me and her finally go on a trip to the mountains. There was absolutely nothing NSFW about this trip. We were just 4 friends on an awesome trip. It was amazing for the most part. But during this trip, I felt that she wasn‚Äôt very eager to spend time with me or strike a conversation with me. I don‚Äôt mean just the two us spending time but in the group in general. Something seemed off on the last day of the trip. There were few instances during the trip which really pricked me. I was pretty sad in my head. I stayed silent and it seemed right at the time. Everybody noticed it including her. They asked what was wrong but I didn‚Äôt say anything thinking it was too insignificant or petty. But I realised the underlying feeling for my sadness. I was still deeply in love with her. I had never moved on but I planned to ask her out once I settle down professionally. I plan to pursue an MBA and thought of asking her out after I landed a well-paying job. That was always the plan. I realised that me pretending to be just friends would be unfair for the both of us. I had reached a point where it was either dating each other or cut contact forever. When she checked on me if I was ok and asked what was wrong, I told her what I really felt. She rejected me again. And with that she dropped another bomb ‚Äì she had a BOYFRIEND! They had broken up but she told me that she wanted to get back with him. Who is he you ask? I don‚Äôt know! I couldn‚Äôt muster up the courage to ask. I think it is X. He seems to have deactivated his IG account. I turned simp again and begged her to give me a chance. I just shut down internally. She asked me where I was for 4 years of her uni life. She gaslit me into believing that I wasn‚Äôt ready to give her time. Was that actually gaslighting or is it just me? I eked out the last drop of self-respect I had left and begged if I ever had a chance to date her in the future. She said no. And now I have blocked her on all social media and my mind is critically fried. I get flashes of her with another guy and I‚Äôm losing sleep over it every day. I‚Äôm losing any positivity that I have left in my life. I feel played and humiliated. I am open to be criticised for my stupidity in the comments. I‚Äôll take it. The whole point of me writing my heart out here is to offload my mental burden that I‚Äôm suffering from. I feel very depressed. I‚Äôve lost interest in pretty much everything. I‚Äôve thought of seeking professional help. I‚Äôve consumed a couple of sleeping pills prescribed for my grandma just to get a good night‚Äôs sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night to flashes of her with somebody else. I am mentally at my lowest in the 23 years of my living. I‚Äôm back spending 2-3 hours in the gym or walking 6-7 km in a stretch because I feel depressed just existing in my home.",2,1759513441.0,RelationshipIndia,5,1.0,False

As the nature of this sub is about tracking body metrics, I would love to show you **Caffeine Clock 2.0**, a tracker I made that shows you your caffeine levels now and in the future, helping you **have undisrupted sleep by timing your caffeine better.**

A bit of context - as a guy who drinks a lot of caffeine, I wanted to make a good caffeine tracking app for a long time, since nothing I found at the time was sufficient. I wanted to make an app that would be easy to use, show you exactly when you‚Äôd have enough caffeine to not have your sleep disrupted, and could add all the drinks I usually drink, for free.

After several iterations, I am now releasing the second major version of Caffeine Clock, which is the caffeine tracking app I always wanted to build.

**Some highlights:**

* **Accurate caffeine algorithm** ‚Äî able to take the absorption rate and a ‚Äúsipping‚Äù duration into account to actually give you a realistic estimate
* **Comprehensive onboarding**, which (at least I hope) asks relevant questions supported by studies ‚Äî those will set your caffeine half-life and sleep-safe threshold
* **Over 200 drinks in the database** ‚Äî or create your own as well
* **Fully offline** ‚Äî the data is only on your phone. No login, nothing. You can move the data from phone to phone
* **Analytics** ‚Äî including average caffeine consumption, a streak of days where your caffeine amount was good at your bedtime, drinks breakdown, etc.
* **Localized** into five languages (some of them AI-translated; please help me if you find something weird)
* **Free**. It is supported by ads, and there is an option to support the app and remove them.

Back in 2024, I bought my Royal Enfield Himalayan 411. It‚Äôs mostly been my Sunday fun machine so far, but I didn‚Äôt get it just for short rides‚ÄîI got it because I‚Äôve been dreaming of a big, bold journey. Originally, my plan was to ride across Europe, into Turkey and Georgia, and then push onward through the Stans, with the Pamir Highway being a major bucket-list goal. But as many of you know, the geopolitical situation around the Caspian Sea has made things tricky.

**South via Iran?** Currently not advised.

**North via Russia?** Also not ideal, especially for that region.

**Ferry across the Caspian?** Slow, unreliable, and a bit of a gamble.

I've looked into shipping my bike back to the Netherlands from Kirgizstan, but the quote I got was around **$10,000 USD**‚Äîmore than I paid for the bike! So that‚Äôs a hard no. Riding back could be an option, or maybe continuing into India and exploring shipping options from there (possibly cheaper?).I don‚Äôt want to postpone the trip, so I‚Äôm now in full-on brainstorming mode. I‚Äôm not new to travelling, but I am new to long-distance motorbike adventures. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and wild ideas. Here are a few alternative routes I‚Äôve been dreaming about:

**Northern Europe loop** ‚Äì Sweden, Finland, the Baltics, Poland. A scenic high tour of Europe.

**Southern loop** ‚Äì Alps into Turkey and Georgia, then back via Romania and Hungary.

**Africa adventure** ‚Äì Either a Cape Town run with shipping options, or a shorter route through Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia (and maybe back or ship from there).

**North America** ‚Äì Ship to Canada, ride through to Alaska, and ship back (though I suspect this might be pricey too).

Lastly, I'm very intestered in time frames. I've got about 5 months. Depending a bit on the wife, the job and the finances... But I don't want to rush and ride day after day. A coffee break, a museum, a hike to a mountain top. So.. riding there and back again is fine, as long a time allows for it.

I‚Äôm open to ideas, advice, and even just spitballing. If you‚Äôve done something similar or have thoughts on logistics, safety, or costs ‚Äî please share!

1nx5gsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1nx5gsq/neglected_cat/,Neglected Cat.,"So I work in the pool service industry. I was at a customer's house and have been servicing their pool for a few months now. Whenever I arrive theres always an old skinny cat outisde. Im fairly certain the cat lives outside in the screened in area with the pool. The cats litter box is put there along with the food bowls.The cat usually doesnt have food and is very low on water so i started giving the cat wet food when i was there. The cat used to have an automatic feeder but it was empty so me and a buddy filled it up when we went to the pool one day so the cat had food to eat when we weren't there. Then a week or so later we noticed the owner had removed the automatic feeder. Concerned we picked up some coffee filter and put a little dry food in that each time we went there. We thought maybe the cat is on a special diet but she is extremely skinny and always goes right to eating when we give her wet food. 

Well now that you have the background here's what I need advice on. I got there today and the cat was in the pool. I have no idea how long she was in there for. So I promptly pulled her out and set her in the sun. I was furious and was cursing the owner of the cat out. The owner wasnt outside but I assume they had cameras and heard me. I then proceeded to dry the cat off and take care of her but then the, who i think was, owner of the cat came outside and asked me to leave because of my vulgarity and informed me the cat was at the vet yesterday. Since I was there for work I did leave like he asked and didnt push the issue. But I looked back and he didnt rush to take care of the cat or anything he had no emotion when he was speaking to me neither. 

Should I call someone? What can be done? And could I have been in the wrong? 

Edit: this cat can barely walk let alone swim. Keeping her in an area with the pool is putting her life in danger. ",4,1759512394.0,CatAdvice,5,1.0,False
1nx5epx,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1nx5epx/my_story_is_really_long_but_id_really_appreciate/,"My story is really long, but I‚Äôd really appreciate your help.","Four months ago, I went to work at a hotel. There, I saw a girl I liked.  
One day while I was working, a pastry chef lady came and told me that the girl I liked also had feelings for me. I felt like the happiest person alive.

In my entire life, I had never spoken to a girl before. I finally convinced myself that it was time to talk to one, so I started talking to her. At first, we only talked, and then I began sitting next to her on the work shuttle. A week later, I got her number. I invited her out for coffee, but she didn‚Äôt come. Instead, she suggested going to the park, and I accepted. We went, we talked, and we had fun. During the conversation, she told me she wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship.

I continued talking to her. Even though I tried to act normal, I made it very obvious that I liked her. I didn‚Äôt directly say ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù but in different ways I had told her many times how much I loved her. She ignored it and kept talking to me as a friend.

Some time passed. One evening, I went to the seaside with some male friends. They told me, ‚ÄúYou love her, go confess.‚Äù I said I couldn‚Äôt. Then suddenly, one of them called her from my phone and handed it to me. I couldn‚Äôt say anything, I just asked about her day. Then my friend took the phone and told her, ‚ÄúThis guy likes you.‚Äù The girl said she only saw me as a friend.

That night she texted me, asking ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù She said she didn‚Äôt think I was a typical guy, and then she suggested we meet at the seaside the next evening. I accepted. We went, talked, laughed, and had fun. At one point, she rested her head on my shoulder. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Again, she said she only saw me as a friend. I accepted that and we went back to our dormitory.

A week later, one of my friends suggested that we ‚Äúplay with her.‚Äù I refused, but in the end, we did it anyway. We created a fake girl‚Äôs account and had her text me. The plan was that this fake girl would write to me, and I would tell the girl I liked about it. I did exactly that. I told the girl again that I liked her, and said, ‚ÄúIf you return my feelings, I want to stay with you. But if you don‚Äôt, then I‚Äôll talk to this other girl.‚Äù She got very angry and upset, it was obvious. I called her and said, ‚ÄúI like you, if you return my feelings, I want to spend my life with you.‚Äù She, with a trembling, almost tearful voice, said, ‚ÄúI only want you as my friend. Why are you forcing this, why don‚Äôt you understand?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt bear her crying voice. Maybe if I had pushed harder, something could have happened, but I couldn‚Äôt. She said she had a bad day and I came on top of it. So I made her laugh, I made her happy again.

Four or five days later, there was a wedding of one of the chefs. I dressed really well and went. Before going, I jokingly told her I would ask her to dance. She said, ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt dare anyway.‚Äù When we arrived, the dance part was already over, we only caught the fun. I saw her among our coworkers, and I went to sit there. Then she came and sat next to me, but I couldn‚Äôt talk. She went back to the other girls. Every time a guy came near her, I felt jealous and kept looking. That night I went to bed feeling guilty, hating myself again.

A few days later, I once again made it obvious that I liked her. Then one evening, I poured my heart out. She invited me to the seaside again to talk. We sat at our usual place, talked, and when the conversation went silent, I finally told her how I felt. She again told me she saw me as a friend and that I should too. She said this was her university exam year and she shouldn‚Äôt be in a relationship. I said, ‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs stay friends, but can we talk again after your exam?‚Äù She said yes.

At that moment, from a nearby hotel by the seaside, a song she liked started playing. I told her, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt dance with you at the wedding, but will you dance with me now?‚Äù She thought I was joking and laughed. I stood up, asked her to dance, and we danced. We both didn‚Äôt know how to dance, we made mistakes, but it was a perfect moment for me. Then we sat down again and watched the light drone show that the hotel prepared. She then told me, ‚ÄúNo one has ever kissed me in my life, but right now I want to kiss you.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYou can.‚Äù She kissed me, and I kissed her back. Then she asked, ‚ÄúAfter all this, are you sure you‚Äôre not in love?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI was already in love long ago, but I need to keep my word.‚Äù We sat a little longer and returned to the dorm.

A week later, I was leaving the job to start university. I told her, ‚ÄúShall we go to the seaside tonight and stay until morning?‚Äù She accepted. That evening, I went out with the guys and came back to the dorm at 11 PM. I fell asleep and woke up at 2:30 AM. I got ready and waited outside, but she didn‚Äôt come. I kept calling and texting, but she didn‚Äôt answer. Finally, I wrote her a note and went to sleep. In the morning, she apologized, saying she had fallen asleep. She invited me to the seaside. That day, I wanted to tell her everything‚Äîthat she used me, that she only took my attention‚Äîbut I couldn‚Äôt. We met, she apologized, I said it was okay, even joked about how long I waited. We went to the seaside, sat down, hugged, cuddled, and kissed. We both knew we weren‚Äôt ‚Äújust friends‚Äù that day‚Äîwe both knew we were like lovers. But since she didn‚Äôt admit it, it wasn‚Äôt official. Later, at the dorm, I asked her if I could hug her one last time. She said yes, so we hugged one last time at the stairs. And then I left for university.

From the day I returned, I never rested. I was always rushing somewhere, always thinking about my inadequacies. Since we were close, she started telling me everything. One day, she told me about her ex-boyfriend, who was a terrible person. She told me I was better. Of course, I started comparing myself with him. He was more handsome and more experienced than me, but she hated him and said she was over him. One day, I told her I had trust issues. She replied, ‚ÄúIf you have trust issues, leave.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt leave. I stayed, kept trying to talk to her, and kept trying to win her heart.

Some time passed, and because of staff shortage, they put the girl I liked to work at the poolside bar with only one male waiter. One day, on his birthday, she made him a waffle and celebrated with him. He was so happy. After that, he constantly started talking to her and complimenting her. She told me all this repeatedly. I pretended like it didn‚Äôt bother me, but inside I was dying of jealousy.

Two weeks ago, she came to my city for a friend‚Äôs birthday. We spent an hour and a half together. We hugged, kissed, cuddled, and even started pushing the limits more. She went to the wedding. That night, I texted her, telling her I loved her and how much her presence changed me. She replied that she was trying to like me, but she just couldn‚Äôt. The next day, she came back to my city before going back to work. We only met for 30 minutes, but again we hugged, kissed, and cuddled. She had cut her hair short. I told her her hair looked beautiful and that this short haircut was my favorite style. She smiled and thanked me. Then she left for work.

The next day, she told me everyone loved her new haircut. I told her I was happy for her because it really suited her. Then again, she brought up the male waiter. She said short hair was also his favorite. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and told her, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my favorite too, I also tell you I love it, but clearly, I don‚Äôt have the same place in your mind as he does.‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúI thanked both of you, but I hug and kiss you. With him, I only thank him.‚Äù

Five days ago, she told me she wanted me only as a friend. I asked her why. I said, ‚ÄúAre you bored of me? Am I doing something wrong?‚Äù She told me that whenever she feels love for someone, she always wants it to be one-sided. When the other person returns her feelings, her emotions fade away. I asked, ‚ÄúI gave you too much attention, didn‚Äôt I? Did I overwhelm you with my affection?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù That day, I should have blocked her, I should never have spoken again. But I didn‚Äôt. I only deleted all her photos from my phone.

The next day, I called her and talked normally, joking around like friends. Then she told me that the male waiter kept complimenting her. I told her, ‚ÄúHe definitely likes you.‚Äù She said he was a very good person, very kind-hearted.

And today, I called her again. We talked for a while, and she said, ‚ÄúYou know what, the male waiter invited me for coffee today. I accepted, and we started following each other on Instagram.‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúWhy? You told me you don‚Äôt like coffee places, so why did you accept his offer?‚Äù She said she was very bored and had nothing else to do. In the end, she didn‚Äôt actually go for coffee, but they are now following each other on Instagram. Then I said, ‚ÄúThat waiter definitely likes you. I worked so hard for you, and you didn‚Äôt accept me, but now will you accept him?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have such an intention, but maybe, who knows?‚Äù

I know right now she‚Äôs in her monthly period and emotionally vulnerable, so it‚Äôs unpredictable what she will do.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to lose the girl I like. She is very flirty and talks with everyone. But she is the only person I love in this world. I don‚Äôt want to lose her. Right now, I feel both pain and anger.",2,1759512257.0,love,5,1.0,False

Rack cards aren‚Äôt just for hotel lobbies anymore. Some of the best placements are in spots where people are waiting or lingering with a few spare minutes.

Think about it:

* Coffee shops (near the sugar/napkin station)
* Bookstores (by checkout or reading corners)
* Fitness studios (by the door or locker area)
* Breweries (highlighting food trucks or upcoming events)
* Community centers (classes, local services, events)

The best ones feel like you stumbled on something useful, not just another ad. For marketers, another feature could be adding perforation for tear-off sections. A detachable piece at the bottom can double as a coupon, business card, raffle ticket, or appointment reminder. It gives people an extra reason to grab and keep it.

  You know, she's a rat. A filthy rat. She's already taken my things from my room without me knowing and used (and if i hadn't noticed the disappearance, she would never have mentioned it, as it happened before) creams, clothes, objects, toys, photos, drawings, etc., all without ever asking or caring about what the owner who lives with her, who has direct to things, knows. She's two-faced with everyone. Don't do anything she doesn't like and be the black sheep, maybe for a day, or a month, maybe a year, or forever. Before, I was her youngest grandson, and I was basically the golden goat, but then I grew up. People grow up, you know, they mature, a concept that must be horrifying to her, as well as empathy, shame, common sense, character.  And at this very moment, where I'm a teenager and only one more year to go to college, and well, I'm basically already full of things, by the way, I care about my future, and also after time I'm in therapy, I realized things that were nebulous to me, serious things, traumas and their beginnings, physical scars that were caused by neglect, which hurt a lot to this day, and I'm not joking. I'm starting to see that my ""grandmother"" that I'm going to say her name anyway (since she doesn't even know English and much less that matters to me, if she reads I will confirm and affirm my point again and again until she dies of a heart attack).  Mis Maria hates all nine of her children, even the dead ones, cursing and sending them to hell, only to later say how much she helped and how poor souls they were. Practically none of them speak to her, since she started the fight with them and cut ties, but she still blames them and says they are all self-interested and she is just a good mother. She beat her children, her old husband with physical and mental limitations, cursed everything about her children, being ungrateful, refusing to be the victim in any of the cases, cursing me and my dead father in a bitch attack along with all shes children except my uncle who was in the kitchen listening, this same uncle who, by the way, must be the only one who has any love, even if small, for her. He does everything she wants, and when he turns his back, she curses him, about how he does nothing, never helps and only sleeps, plays, whatever she thinks. My uncle, Junior, is one of my most beloved uncles, he helps everyone and is a sweetheart, he would try to help you and be a shoulder to cry on in any crisis. But that doesn't matter to her, I stopped being loved when I tried to impose my limits, when I told her that my things shouldn't be thrown away while I was in class just because she wanted the hallway cleaned and the rest of my childhood belongings given to a stranger who lives nearby.  I have so much to share, but there are so many things that it's difficult. Like today, at the lunch table, I noticed my childhood box next to the coffee and sugar. A while ago, while I was in class, she came into the middle of my bedroom, cleaned my floor, and left everything piled up on top of some furniture. When I came back, everything was messed up. I thought with relief that she hadn't taken anything. What a mistake. After lunch, I went to check, and the box wasn't there. But before checking, I asked her, and she, looking into my eyes, said, ""Uncle Cris gave it to me."" I thought, what a coincidence, and said i had one just like it before she launching into a story about her winning something, or doing something incredibly good, or just incredible at the table, or about how she was the poor victim and everyone was evil.

* The Mayor's office is losing three critical staffers at the same time the city is grappling with its biggest crises around homelessness and public safety.
* City Council just voted 9-2 to ban public nudity, and the debate around it is exactly what you'd expect.
* Activists believe their daily monitoring has successfully pushed ICE operations out of Burlington's airport, shifting the agency's regional ""shell game"" elsewhere.
* Vermont's drug crisis is entering a new, alarming phase as users shift from injecting opioids to smoking stimulants like crack and meth, leaving responders with fewer options.
* There's more in the newsletter, including how much house $500k buys you now and which federal green energy grants just got cut.

**SOME of this Weekend's Events:**

* **Tonight (Friday):**¬†The lineup is wild: choose between a 1920s jazz swing dance, a Taylor Swift listening party at Venetian Soda Lounge, free stargazing with the Astronomical Society, or haunted laser tag in Colchester. Plus much more.
* **Saturday:**¬†The stellar weather is perfect for the Burlington Farmers Market, the massive Construction Fest on Church St (with truck fashion shows), or catching Bruce Hornsby & the Noisemakers at Higher Ground. Plus much more.
* **Sunday:**¬†Sunday could break records, so hit the gigantic indoor flea market at the Expo, the Vermont Anime and Gaming Expo downtown, or a vinyl pop-up show in Winooski. Plus much more.
* There are literally hundreds more events, times, and links in the full newsletter.

**Btown Brief IRL:**

The newsletter‚Äôs thriving, but turning readers into real-life connections is tougher than expected. It seems you guys really enjoy the coffee meetups, but we haven‚Äôt see too many sign ups to the local events around town. That‚Äôs why tomorrow matters, we're having our regular casual coffee meetup at Zero Gravity tomorrow (Saturday) at 10 AM to talk about what events¬†*you*¬†want to see. Come hang out. Join and help shape the calendar:

[Link to Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/burlington-social-activites-group/)

These are the highlights. The full Btown Brief has the details, sources, and every link you need to plan your weekend. Plus food/drink deals, restaurant reviews, and volunteer opportunities!

1nx58de,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1nx58de/wellbutrin_and_its_effect_on_audhd_brain/,Wellbutrin and its effect on auDHD brain?,"I'm officially diagnosed with low support level autism and a bit of ADHD. I took all kinds of SSRI for years because they were trying to treat what they falsely attributed to generalized anxiety disorder. It never worked, it only made me gain weight while making me feel like a robot with no emotion. The subject of Wellbutrin came when I realized most of that ""anxiety"" came from an overactive brain. First, I was put on 150XL tablet. I had a bit of insomnia, but it gave me a good amount of energy too. Anxiety was more manageable as if I gained the ability to control my train of thoughts more easily. I was able to stop abusing coffee to make it through the day.

But then, the bad effects came after two weeks. I got this brain fog which I couldn't get myself out of. I had difficulty articulating my thoughts and it was a huge problem since slow processing was already part of my autism. So, I asked to see if I could switch to 100SR tablet and they told me I could split it in half if I wanted. I ended trying half a pill (50mg) and there were still too many side effects (brain fog, feeling a bit numbed out). So, I decided to split in quarter (25mg) and I feel it's more manageable. I get less anxiety while still feeling present in the moment. 

My question is : does anyone else with autism experienced the same thing? When I told the pharmacist I wanted to only take half a pill, she made sure to remind me it wasn't even above the threshold for a therapeutic dose. Then, I reminded her that autistic people often get strange reaction to medication, especially with pills that impact the brain. I heard that it was because we have more neurotransmitters. Too bad I had to waste 25 years of my life to realize my autistic brain was peculiar and antidepressants would affect me in a different way than most people.",1,1759511851.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False
1nx56hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPrinting/comments/1nx56hq/rack_cards_outside_hotels_where_have_you_seen/,Rack cards outside hotels ‚Äî where have you seen them work?,"Have you found a good spot for rack cards where people actually pick them up and read them? Rack cards aren‚Äôt just for hotel lobbies. Some of the best placements are in spots where people are waiting or lingering with a few spare minutes.

Think about it:

* Coffee shops (near the sugar/napkin station)
* Bookstores (by checkout or reading corners)
* Fitness studios (by the door or locker area)
* Breweries (highlighting food trucks or upcoming events)
* Community centers (classes, local services, events)

Now the good. Island Abalone is BACK. These ocean snails are almost extinct in the wild. And they're one of the world's truly-great luxury foods. You can help the company by buying some. And you can help even more by asking (demanding) Big Island Abalone at seafood restaurants, state-wide. Our restaurants make a big production buying lobsters from 10,000 miles away. But they can't buy a better local product? Ridiculous.

1nx4zsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nx4zsh/counterclockwise/,Counterclockwise,"

The Barstow Greyhound station at 2 AM is its own kind of purgatory. Just off the 15, halfway between Vegas and LA, where desperate people wait for buses that may or may not show up. That night in October, it was me, an old drunk asleep on the floor, and him.

First thing I noticed were his hands. Too clean for someone taking a Greyhound at this hour. Pink like he'd been scrubbing dishes, except his jacket had years of road dirt ground into it. Brown thing that might've been nice in the eighties. Dark stains on the cuffs that could've been coffee or could've been something else.

He had one of those forgettable faces - gray stubble, watery eyes shot through with red veins. Maybe sixty. But those hands belonged to someone else entirely.

""Going to Phoenix?"" He nodded at the ticket sticking out of my pocket.

""Yeah.""

""Me too. Eventually."" He sat down a few seats over. The plastic bench groaned. ""Knew someone from Phoenix. Katherine Wells.""

My mother's name. I kept my face neutral, but my spine went rigid against the hard plastic.

""Pretty common name.""

He smiled without looking at me directly. More like he was smiling at something just past my shoulder. ""This Katherine was specific. Left Sacramento in '92. February, I think. Had a little girl with her. Rebecca.""

The way he said my name - not asking, just stating it like reading from a file.

""Good guess.""

""I don't guess."" He unscrewed a thermos, poured coffee into the cap. The smell drifted over - vanilla extract and cinnamon. Mom's exact recipe. ""Katherine had this quirk. Always stirred her coffee the wrong way round. Counter-clockwise. Said her mother taught her that.""

True. Every word.

""How'd you know her?"" My voice came out steadier than I felt.

""We met briefly. I remember people."" He took a sip. ""She had this scar on her palm. Crescent-shaped. Told people she got it from broken glass.""

Dad gave her that scar. But she never told anyone that part.

My hands found the frayed edges of my hoodie cuffs, pulled them down to cover my wrists. ""You're freaking me out.""

""Sorry. Don't mean to."" He stood, walked to the vending machine. ""Want something? My treat.""

""I'm good.""

The machine took his dollar. Then another. Nothing. He made this sound - not quite a laugh, more like wind through dead branches. Hit the machine once, precise, and a candy bar tumbled down.

""Learned that trick here actually. From a guy named Tom who worked maintenance. Night shifts. His daughter went missing in '09. Also named Rebecca, oddly enough.""

The candy bar was some off-brand thing with Arabic writing on it.

""Your mother still make that pot roast? With the little red potatoes cut crosswise?""

My legs stood up without my permission.

""Wait,"" he called. ""Before you run off. She ever mention the cabin? The one in Big Bear her family supposedly had?""

We never owned property anywhere. But when I couldn't sleep as a kid, mom would spin these elaborate stories about a cabin in Big Bear where we'd go someday, where the doors locked from the inside and nobody could find us.

The bathroom at the Barstow station has one of those motion-sensor lights that never quite work right. Kept flickering while I stood at the sink, running cold water over my wrists, trying to slow my pulse. Stayed in there maybe fifteen minutes, maybe twenty. Time moves weird when you're terrified.

When I came back out, he was reading. No dust jacket on the book, pages yellowed.

""Better?"" He didn't look up.

My bus pulled up ten minutes later. I practically ran up the steps. As the driver was closing the door, the man called out:

""Rebecca?""

Against every instinct, I turned.

""Your mother's a good woman. Doesn't deserve what happened to her.""

""She's fine,"" I said. ""She's alive.""

That smile again. Small. Patient. ""Today she is.""

The bus ride to Phoenix took six hours. I called mom forty-three times. Straight to voicemail every time. By the time we hit Blythe, I'd convinced myself she was dead. By Quartzsite, I'd planned her funeral.

But when I finally got to her house - hammering on the door hard enough to bruise my knuckles - she answered in her bathrobe, annoyed as hell.

""Jesus, Becca. It's seven in the morning.""

""Your phone‚Äî""

""Been weird all week. Keep meaning to get it looked at."" She shuffled toward the kitchen. ""Want coffee?""

That's when I saw it. On the counter. Her good mug, the one with the chip on the handle she refused to throw away. Still steaming.

""Did you just make this?""

""What? No, I just woke up.""

The spoon was resting against the rim. Positioned like someone had been stirring. I touched the handle - the metal was still warm.

""Mom, do you stir your coffee clockwise or counter-clockwise?""

She gave me the look she used to when I'd ask stupid questions as a kid. ""Counter-clockwise. Like my mother did. Like her mother did. Why are you being weird?""

The coffee smelled like vanilla and cinnamon.

For three months, I managed to convince myself it was nothing. Coincidence. Some lonely old creep who happened to know someone similar to my mom. Phoenix is full of Katherines. The coffee thing - maybe mom made it and forgot. Early onset something. Stress.

Then I started looking up that other Rebecca. The one whose dad worked maintenance.

Found her in an archived news article from the Riverside Press-Enterprise. Rebecca Gonzalez, 22, missing since November 2009. Last seen at the Barstow Greyhound station. Heading to Phoenix to visit family.

The photo was grainy, but I could see it. Same dark hair. Same basic face shape. We could've been cousins.

So I searched for more. Took me weeks of digging through missing persons sites, old forums, newspaper archives. Found another Rebecca - Rebecca Chen, disappeared from a Greyhound in El Paso, 2011. Rebecca Washington, Albuquerque, 2014. Rebecca Taylor, Flagstaff, 2016.

All early twenties. All dark hair. All traveling alone to Phoenix.

All looked like variations of me.

The obsession started small. Quick searches on my lunch break. Then it was every evening, laptop hot on my thighs, clicking through cold case sites until my eyes burned. I mapped out routes, times, patterns. Made a spreadsheet. The Rebeccas were increasing in frequency. Used to be one every few years. Now it was every few months.

I started calling Greyhound stations. Pretending to be a reporter, a concerned relative, anyone who might get answers. Most people hung up. A few remembered things. A security guard in El Paso said Rebecca Chen had been talking to an older man before she disappeared. ""Harmless-looking guy. Grandfatherly.""

Six months after Barstow, I was deep in a true crime forum when someone posted about unsecured security cameras. ""Digital voyeurism,"" they called it. Lists of IP addresses for cameras people forgot to password protect. Halfway down the list: ""Barstow Transit - Interior - Night.""

My hands shook as I typed in the address.

The feed was shit quality. Black and white, jerky frame rate. But it was real. I could see the bench where I'd sat. The vending machine. The bathroom door.

And at 2:14¬†AM, I saw him.

Same jacket. Same posture. Sitting in the exact spot he'd been when I met him. He had his thermos out, occasionally taking sips. Once in a while, he'd check his watch - the face caught the light in a way that didn't make sense, like it was reflecting something that wasn't there.

I watched for three hours. He barely moved.

Then, at 4:47¬†AM, a girl showed up. Young, maybe twenty. Dark hair in a ponytail. Backpack that said she was traveling light, traveling cheap. She sat down to wait.

He said something. She laughed, polite but cautious. They talked. I watched her body language shift - friendly to uncomfortable to scared. She stood up, started walking toward the bathroom. He said something else. She stopped. Came back. Sat down, but further away now.

The feed froze. When it came back eight seconds later, her seat was empty.

His wasn't.

He sat there another hour, finishing his coffee.

I watch that feed every night now. Password: admin. Username: admin. Whoever set it up never bothered to change the defaults.

He shows up maybe twice a month. Always between 2 and 3 AM. Always with the thermos. Sometimes alone. Sometimes talking to young women.

Three weeks ago, there was a girl who looked so much like me I actually drove to Barstow to make sure it wasn't. By the time I got there, she was gone. He was still there, though. Sitting on that bench. I watched from my car in the parking lot as he finished his coffee and walked out to a beige Corolla that had to be thirty years old.

I followed him for twelve miles before I lost my nerve and turned around.

Last week, another girl. Blonde this time, but something about her build, the way she held herself. They talked for an hour. She kept trying to leave. He kept saying things that made her sit back down. Finally, she got up and walked quickly toward the exit. He followed, unhurried.

They passed out of camera range.

She never came back.

Tonight I'm watching again. It's 1:58¬†AM and he's not there yet, but he will be. He's been showing up more frequently. Every ten days now instead of every two weeks.

While I wait, I search for new Rebeccas. Found one last month - Rebecca Martinez, 24, missing from Tucson Greyhound. Heading to Phoenix. The pattern holds.

2:14¬†AM. There he is. Same bench. Same jacket. But tonight something's different.

He's not alone. There's someone with him. They're facing away from the camera, but I can see long dark hair. Jeans. A gray hoodie.

My gray hoodie. The one I was wearing that night.

But that's impossible because I'm here, in my apartment, watching this feed. I'm not in Barstow. I'm here.

The figure turns slightly. I see the profile.

It's me. But not me now. Me from that night. Same clothes, same posture, same everything.

He's talking to her - to me - and she's nodding. She looks relaxed. Comfortable, even. Nothing like how I remember feeling.

This is impossible. This feed is live. The timestamp says October 15th, 2024, 2:16¬†AM. Today. Right now.

But I'm here.

The me on the screen stands up, walks to the vending machine with him. Laughs at something he says. Takes the candy bar he offers.

I never took the candy bar.

She sits back down, closer to him this time. They're still talking. She's showing him something on her phone. Photos, maybe. She looks happy.

I'm calling the Barstow station. No one answers - it's the middle of the night.

On the screen, the other me is standing up. But not to leave. She's following him toward the exit. Not scared. Not running. Walking with him like they're old friends.

They pass out of camera range.

I wait.

Five minutes. Ten. Twenty.

Neither of them comes back.

The timestamp still says 2:16¬†AM. It's been saying 2:16¬†AM for half an hour now.

My phone rings. Unknown number.

""Hello?""

Breathing. Then: ""Rebecca?""

His voice.

""How did you get this number?""

""You gave it to me. Just now. Don't you remember?""

""I'm at home. I'm watching you on‚Äî""

""Are you sure?""

I look at the screen. The timestamp has changed. 3:47¬†AM. The bench is empty except for something small on the seat.

""What did you do?""

""Nothing you didn't want. Check your door, Rebecca.""

I don't want to. But I do.

There's a candy bar on my doormat. The same off-brand one with Arabic writing.

It's still cold, like it just came out of a vending machine.

""How?""

""Your mother asked me the same thing once. February 1992. Didn't she ever tell you why you really left Sacramento?""

The line goes dead.

I haven't slept in three days. I've called mom eighteen times but she's not answering. Her phone is off. I'm driving to Phoenix in the morning.

The feed is still running. He hasn't come back. But something's wrong with the timestamp now. Sometimes it says 2024. Sometimes 2009. Sometimes 1992.

And sometimes I see her. The other me. Sitting on that bench alone, drinking coffee from a thermos, waiting.

She stirs it counter-clockwise.

Just like mom taught her.

1nx4z0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nx4z0c/counterclockwise/,Counterclockwise,"The Barstow Greyhound station at 2 AM is its own kind of purgatory. Just off the 15, halfway between Vegas and LA, where desperate people wait for buses that may or may not show up. That night in October, it was me, an old drunk asleep on the floor, and him.

First thing I noticed were his hands. Too clean for someone taking a Greyhound at this hour. Pink like he'd been scrubbing dishes, except his jacket had years of road dirt ground into it. Brown thing that might've been nice in the eighties. Dark stains on the cuffs that could've been coffee or could've been something else.

He had one of those forgettable faces - gray stubble, watery eyes shot through with red veins. Maybe sixty. But those hands belonged to someone else entirely.

""Going to **Phoenix**?"" He nodded at the ticket sticking out of my pocket.

""Yeah.""

""Me too. Eventually."" He sat down a few seats over. The plastic bench groaned. ""Knew someone from Phoenix. Katherine Wells.""

My mother's name. I kept my face neutral, but my spine went rigid against the hard plastic.

""Pretty common name.""

He smiled without looking at me directly. More like he was smiling at something just past my shoulder. ""This Katherine was specific. Left Sacramento in '92. February, I think. Had a little girl with her. Rebecca.""

The way he said my name - not asking, just stating it like reading from a file.

""Good guess.""

""I don't guess."" He unscrewed a thermos, poured coffee into the cap. The smell drifted over - vanilla extract and cinnamon. Mom's exact recipe. ""Katherine had this quirk. Always stirred her coffee the wrong way round. Counter-clockwise. Said her mother taught her that.""

True. Every word.

""How'd you know her?"" My voice came out steadier than I felt.

""We met briefly. I remember people."" He took a sip. ""She had this scar on her palm. Crescent-shaped. Told people she got it from broken glass.""

Dad gave her that scar. But she never told anyone that part.

My hands found the frayed edges of my hoodie cuffs, pulled them down to cover my wrists. ""You're freaking me out.""

""Sorry. Don't mean to."" He stood, walked to the vending machine. ""Want something? My treat.""

""I'm good.""

The machine took his dollar. Then another. Nothing. He made this sound - not quite a laugh, more like wind through dead branches. Hit the machine once, precise, and a candy bar tumbled down.

""Learned that trick here actually. From a guy named Tom who worked maintenance. Night shifts. His daughter went missing in '09. Also named Rebecca, oddly enough.""

The candy bar was some off-brand thing with Arabic writing on it.

""Your mother still make that pot roast? With the little red potatoes cut crosswise?""

My legs stood up without my permission.

""Wait,"" he called. ""Before you run off. She ever mention the cabin? The one in Big Bear her family supposedly had?""

We never owned property anywhere. But when I couldn't sleep as a kid, mom would spin these elaborate stories about a cabin in Big Bear where we'd go someday, where the doors locked from the inside and nobody could find us.

The bathroom at the Barstow station has one of those motion-sensor lights that never quite work right. Kept flickering while I stood at the sink, running cold water over my wrists, trying to slow my pulse. Stayed in there maybe fifteen minutes, maybe twenty. Time moves weird when you're terrified.

When I came back out, he was reading. No dust jacket on the book, pages yellowed.

""Better?"" He didn't look up.

My bus pulled up ten minutes later. I practically ran up the steps. As the driver was closing the door, the man called out:

""Rebecca?""

Against every instinct, I turned.

""Your mother's a good woman. Doesn't deserve what happened to her.""

""She's fine,"" I said. ""She's alive.""

That smile again. Small. Patient. ""Today she is.""

The bus ride to Phoenix took six hours. I called mom forty-three times. Straight to voicemail every time. By the time we hit Blythe, I'd convinced myself she was dead. By Quartzsite, I'd planned her funeral.

But when I finally got to her house - hammering on the door hard enough to bruise my knuckles - she answered in her bathrobe, annoyed as hell.

""Jesus, Becca. It's seven in the morning.""

""Your phone‚Äî""

""Been weird all week. Keep meaning to get it looked at."" She shuffled toward the kitchen. ""Want coffee?""

That's when I saw it. On the counter. Her good mug, the one with the chip on the handle she refused to throw away. Still steaming.

""Did you just make this?""

""What? No, I just woke up.""

The spoon was resting against the rim. Positioned like someone had been stirring. I touched the handle - the metal was still warm.

""Mom, do you stir your coffee clockwise or counter-clockwise?""

She gave me the look she used to when I'd ask stupid questions as a kid. ""Counter-clockwise. Like my mother did. Like her mother did. Why are you being weird?""

The coffee smelled like vanilla and cinnamon.

For three months, I managed to convince myself it was nothing. Coincidence. Some lonely old creep who happened to know someone similar to my mom. Phoenix is full of Katherines. The coffee thing - maybe mom made it and forgot. Early onset something. Stress.

Then I started looking up that other Rebecca. The one whose dad worked maintenance.

Found her in an archived news article from the Riverside Press-Enterprise. Rebecca Gonzalez, 22, missing since November 2009. Last seen at the Barstow Greyhound station. Heading to Phoenix to visit family.

The photo was grainy, but I could see it. Same dark hair. Same basic face shape. We could've been cousins.

So I searched for more. Took me weeks of digging through missing persons sites, old forums, newspaper archives. Found another Rebecca - Rebecca Chen, disappeared from a Greyhound in El Paso, 2011. Rebecca Washington, Albuquerque, 2014. Rebecca Taylor, Flagstaff, 2016.

All early twenties. All dark hair. All traveling alone to Phoenix.

All looked like variations of me.

The obsession started small. Quick searches on my lunch break. Then it was every evening, laptop hot on my thighs, clicking through cold case sites until my eyes burned. I mapped out routes, times, patterns. Made a spreadsheet. The Rebeccas were increasing in frequency. Used to be one every few years. Now it was every few months.

I started calling Greyhound stations. Pretending to be a reporter, a concerned relative, anyone who might get answers. Most people hung up. A few remembered things. A security guard in El Paso said Rebecca Chen had been talking to an older man before she disappeared. ""Harmless-looking guy. Grandfatherly.""

Six months after Barstow, I was deep in a true crime forum when someone posted about unsecured security cameras. ""Digital voyeurism,"" they called it. Lists of IP addresses for cameras people forgot to password protect. Halfway down the list: ""Barstow Transit - Interior - Night.""

My hands shook as I typed in the address.

The feed was shit quality. Black and white, jerky frame rate. But it was real. I could see the bench where I'd sat. The vending machine. The bathroom door.

And at 2:14¬†AM, I saw him.

Same jacket. Same posture. Sitting in the exact spot he'd been when I met him. He had his thermos out, occasionally taking sips. Once in a while, he'd check his watch - the face caught the light in a way that didn't make sense, like it was reflecting something that wasn't there.

I watched for three hours. He barely moved.

Then, at 4:47¬†AM, a girl showed up. Young, maybe twenty. Dark hair in a ponytail. Backpack that said she was traveling light, traveling cheap. She sat down to wait.

He said something. She laughed, polite but cautious. They talked. I watched her body language shift - friendly to uncomfortable to scared. She stood up, started walking toward the bathroom. He said something else. She stopped. Came back. Sat down, but further away now.

The feed froze. When it came back eight seconds later, her seat was empty.

His wasn't.

He sat there another hour, finishing his coffee.

I watch that feed every night now. Password: admin. Username: admin. Whoever set it up never bothered to change the defaults.

He shows up maybe twice a month. Always between 2 and 3 AM. Always with the thermos. Sometimes alone. Sometimes talking to young women.

Three weeks ago, there was a girl who looked so much like me I actually drove to Barstow to make sure it wasn't. By the time I got there, she was gone. He was still there, though. Sitting on that bench. I watched from my car in the parking lot as he finished his coffee and walked out to a beige Corolla that had to be thirty years old.

I followed him for twelve miles before I lost my nerve and turned around.

Last week, another girl. Blonde this time, but something about her build, the way she held herself. They talked for an hour. She kept trying to leave. He kept saying things that made her sit back down. Finally, she got up and walked quickly toward the exit. He followed, unhurried.

They passed out of camera range.

She never came back.

Tonight I'm watching again. It's 1:58¬†AM and he's not there yet, but he will be. He's been showing up more frequently. Every ten days now instead of every two weeks.

While I wait, I search for new Rebeccas. Found one last month - Rebecca Martinez, 24, missing from Tucson Greyhound. Heading to Phoenix. The pattern holds.

2:14¬†AM. There he is. Same bench. Same jacket. But tonight something's different.

He's not alone. There's someone with him. They're facing away from the camera, but I can see long dark hair. Jeans. A gray hoodie.

My gray hoodie. The one I was wearing that night.

But that's impossible because I'm here, in my apartment, watching this feed. I'm not in Barstow. I'm here.

The figure turns slightly. I see the profile.

It's me. But not me now. Me from that night. Same clothes, same posture, same everything.

He's talking to her - to me - and she's nodding. She looks relaxed. Comfortable, even. Nothing like how I remember feeling.

This is impossible. This feed is live. The timestamp says October 15th, 2024, 2:16¬†AM. Today. Right now.

But I'm here.

The me on the screen stands up, walks to the vending machine with him. Laughs at something he says. Takes the candy bar he offers.

I never took the candy bar.

She sits back down, closer to him this time. They're still talking. She's showing him something on her phone. Photos, maybe. She looks happy.

I'm calling the Barstow station. No one answers - it's the middle of the night.

On the screen, the other me is standing up. But not to leave. She's following him toward the exit. Not scared. Not running. Walking with him like they're old friends.

They pass out of camera range.

I wait.

Five minutes. Ten. Twenty.

Neither of them comes back.

The timestamp still says 2:16¬†AM. It's been saying 2:16¬†AM for half an hour now.

My phone rings. Unknown number.

""Hello?""

Breathing. Then: ""Rebecca?""

His voice.

""How did you get this number?""

""You gave it to me. Just now. Don't you remember?""

""I'm at home. I'm watching you on‚Äî""

""Are you sure?""

I look at the screen. The timestamp has changed. 3:47¬†AM. The bench is empty except for something small on the seat.

""What did you do?""

""Nothing you didn't want. Check your door, Rebecca.""

I don't want to. But I do.

There's a candy bar on my doormat. The same off-brand one with Arabic writing.

It's still cold, like it just came out of a vending machine.

""How?""

""Your mother asked me the same thing once. February 1992. Didn't she ever tell you why you really left Sacramento?""

The line goes dead.

I haven't slept in three days. I've called mom eighteen times but she's not answering. Her phone is off. I'm driving to Phoenix in the morning.

The feed is still running. He hasn't come back. But something's wrong with the timestamp now. Sometimes it says 2024. Sometimes 2009. Sometimes 1992.

And sometimes I see her. The other me. Sitting on that bench alone, drinking coffee from a thermos, waiting.

She stirs it counter-clockwise.

Just like mom taught her.

this winter I am looking to save some money by planning my meals while I am on unemployment from my gardening/landscape job.  I am honestly hoping to do all my shopping while I am still getting regular checks, which are I think about twice as much as I‚Äôll be getting in the off season.  Having said that, I‚Äôm hoping I can get away with spending 30 dollars average each month for meals.  I do have a dehydrator, and would like to implement that. I also have free coffee from my apartment building so that‚Äôs really my one definite perk.  Some ideas I have so far are buying dried beans, and using those to make soup and other meals.  Another thing I am planning on is buying a half ham or two and dehydrating whatever I can‚Äôt eat or freeze.  As far as fruits and vegetables go, I want to do a bunch of dehydrating and basically put together soup mixes that I can store in mason jars.  Would frozen veggies be my best option, or do I need to get fresh if I want to dehydrate?  I have very limited freezer space, maybe two cubic feet? I plan to have grilled cheese as a staple because it‚Äôs just so cheap, but obviously not healthy.   My main meal will be soups I think.  I know I can do my own research, and I am, but asking people on this sub is part of that. Even just how to find the best deals on non perishable items would be so helpful! One last thing is that I do have a dog and it would be cool to be able to make some cheap healthy treats at home for him.

Thinking about trying fasting but not sure where to start? ü§î  
Fasting can be an amazing tool for weight loss, mental clarity, and even spiritual growth ‚Äî but only if you do it right.

Here‚Äôs a simple guide to help beginners get started with **intermittent fasting** or **short-term fasts** safely:

# üïí Step 1: Start Small

* Begin with **12 hours** (e.g., stop eating at 8 PM, eat at 8 AM).
* Once comfortable, move to **14‚Äì16 hours** (the sweet spot for many beginners).

# üåø Step 2: Use the Right Drinks

During your fast you can have:

* Water (still or sparkling).
* Black coffee (no cream, sugar, or sweeteners).
* Herbal teas (peppermint, ginger, green tea) ‚Äî these can **suppress hunger naturally**.

# ü•ó Step 3: Eat Smart Before & After

* **Pre-fast meal:** high in protein + healthy fats + fiber (keeps you full).
* **Break your fast gently:** start with something light like fruit, soup, or bone broth.

# üí° Step 4: Pro Tips to Make It Easier

* Add a pinch of pink salt or electrolytes to water to avoid headaches.
* Stay busy ‚Äî fasting feels harder if you‚Äôre idle.
* Avoid TV or social media with food ads (it triggers cravings).
* Chew sugar-free gum to help with mouth hunger.
* Walk or do light exercise ‚Äî it boosts fat burning and distracts you.

# üßò Step 5: Make It Holistic

* Pair fasting with meditation or journaling for mental clarity.
* Use affirmations to reframe hunger (‚Äúthis is healing my body‚Äù).
* Try herbal support: cinnamon tea (hunger control), ginger tea (stomach soothe), mint tea (calm mind).

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

* If you‚Äôre underweight, pregnant, nursing, or have a medical condition, talk to a doctor first.
* Fasting isn‚Äôt about starving yourself ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating a healthy rhythm for your body.

üí¨ **What‚Äôs your fasting goal?** Weight loss, energy, mental clarity, spiritual growth? Drop your questions below and let‚Äôs get through Fasting Friday together! üåô",1,1759510895.0,PsychicLasVegas,0,1.0,False

1nx4po6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nx4po6,Advise,"So I am in my mid 30s and only started to really care for my teeth at 28 years old. I also have bad genetics on both sides of my family and my state does not have flouride in the tap water. As a result my teeth look like the above photos. Cavity #1 is the last upper molar on my left side. Cavity #2 is a cavity ive known about for several years (I lost insurance coverage before I could treat it) and is also on my left side, but in between my canine and premolar. Cavity #3 is on the last upper molar of my right side.

I have several questions, in order of importance:

Question #1: I discovered 2 cavities (each on the gum line of my last upper mollars of the left and right side) a few weeks ago and just had a dentist visit and cleaning today. They are completely booked out until February of 2026 but aren't too concerned about the cavities progressing in that time based off of my xrays (I forgot to ask for a copy). I also live in a small town so going to a different dentist that is taking new patients isn't really an option, but I really like this dentist and they put me on their call list in case there is a cancellation.

What can I do in the meantime to treat this? I've heard about at home flouride that you paint on your teeth but I'm honestly lost with it all. 
How can I prevent this in the future? I brush, floss, and waterpik every single night and use a sonicare toothbrush. I admit that I don't brush in the mornings but that is something I will start immediately. 

Question #2: I got a cleaning today and the hygienist (bless her) really scrubbed as best as she could but she said the staining left on my teeth won't come off because it is on some fillings I have in those areas. Also, she said she can't really remove the staining, just the plaque and tartar. Any recommendations on removing the stains? I have pointed out the cavities in the photos but everything else is just discoloration. Also, I am a daily coffee drinker, one large 32 oz (with cream) coffee every morning, no smoking, no drinking, no teas. I am not willing to stop my coffee habit, and I usually finish it within 1.5 hours. I also use a straw for my coffee but I havent noticed a difference since implementing it a few years ago.

Question #3: My two front teeth used to be longer, but I was a nail biter from 5 years old until my mid 20's and it wore down my left front tooth. A previous dentist filed my right tooth so that they matched but I always felt they were too short for my mouth. Additionally, another dentist filled a cavity I had on my left front tooth but she shaped it too fat and weird. Any suggestions for lengthening or shape change would be great. I've considered veneers but I dont want to remove any remaining enamal or teeth that I have left.

Lastly, how fucked up are my teeth? Be honest.

My main goal is preservation of whats left of my teeth and oral health. A close second is aesthetics.",1,1759510714.0,Teeth,1,1.0,False
1nx4p0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jalgaon/comments/1nx4p0q/something_strange_happend_with_me/,Something Strange Happend with me,"On **23 April 2019** something strange happened with me. I even can't describe. On 22 April 2019 we have a wedding of our relative and they invited us for the wedding its very common y'all know; after arriving and attending the wedding of our relatives that was a night wedding. We have decided with leave earlier ofcourse my uncle and auntie have alot of work to do but my auntie decided to go after few days. She have maternal uncle house at that village so she decided to stay for while while we (Me and uncle) decided to leave the wedding. I know we are going to late so my uncle, me and other 4 people decided to leave the wedding so after discussing all things like bride and groom job, nature etc. The route was so long and we decided to take some break like tea/coffee break so we drink a tea from the stall and begin to continue our journey from Dhule to my village its around 100km idk actually. Its all good until a place called Ramdev wadi arrived. I saw something strange and very weird I even don't know what's that but still its unimaginable. There is something in white saree or something was walking around 1:25 AM on 23 April 2019. I thought maybe its just a psyco women walking at night i didn't care that much but after carefully observing that women her foot was in little bit on air like she is walking on the air and her legs was little tilted. I told me uncle ""Uncle there is women but she is walking on air and her legs are also tiled "" My uncle said just f\*cking watch forward don't dare to watch backward like he knows what's going on. After passing the horrific route we arrived home safely without any harm but idk whats that maybe witch, ghost or preat.

After telling to my friend who is also from Ramdev Wadi said there is something wrong with that route NH-753J.

1nx4nwk,https://i.redd.it/o5dfih8egxsf1.jpeg,Open or closed kitchen?,"I‚Äôm taking over a cafe in my town. They mainly sold breakfasts, sandwiches, wraps, pastries , coffee etc. their kitchen area was/is very basic as they did not do any cooking involving fryers, gas grills etc. 

I intend to do a similar menu but will be adding an evening menu of burgers, wings, tacos, loaded fries etc. this will involve using a deep fryer, a large burger grill etc. 

The current set up is open plan and I‚Äôm wondering if I should close it? The reason being kitchen noise and smells seeping into the seating area. There is an extraction unit in place already. 

I have included a rudimentary sketch of the layout, not to scale!

The shaded area is the cooking area, there is another prep room out back. I will be putting in the cooking equip along wall 3 (fryers, grill etc). Walls 1 & 2 are about 4.5 ft in height. The inside of wall 1 will have prep fridges and saladette where the burgers, wings etc are assembled and garnished before sending out. If I close it off then I intend to incorporate a pass in wall 2. 

5 is where the bar counter is and 4 is the front door.

I‚Äôm looking for pros and cons for both options if you good folk don‚Äôt mind!

I bought a blood glucose monitor to test my blood. I am in the days leading up to my period so please no judgement on what I ate yesterday, it‚Äôs probably the unhealthiest day I‚Äôve had in a while.

I had a small 7brew and mcdonalds around 2-3pm, finished the coffee around 5pm, and at 7pm I tested my blood glucose for the first time ever.

It was only one test at 112 mg/dl. 

 Afterwards I ate spaghetti and then around 12-1am I had a couple fried oreos, half a cookie, and later a little more than a handful of goldfish crackers. All with lots of water

I fell asleep at 3:30 am and woke up at 10:54 am and tested again around 11:00 am. I feel very very scared and anxious while doing it.

My first reading was 104 mg/dl which scared the crap out of me. I tested three times afterwards until I ran out of lancets at 99 mg/dl, 90 mg/dl, and lastly 95 mg/dl.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I‚Äôm 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can‚Äôt do the whole ‚Äúu‚Äù instead of ‚Äúyou‚Äù thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don‚Äôt want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you‚Äôd like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here‚Äôs an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1759509785.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve made a few ‚Äòacquaintances‚Äô but I wouldn‚Äôt, for example, ask them to go out, or go for a coffee, or text them before a lecture to ask where they are and whether they want to sit together. I‚Äôve talked to one guy in particular (a little on instagram, sat next to each other in a few lectures after seeing each other by chance etc), but it seems like I‚Äôm the one making the effort.

Am I being left behind, or do most people feel like this? Also, I‚Äôve been to a couple society socials and not made much progress. Again, a fee acquaintances but no friends.

1nx46os,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1nx46os/reveal_the_truth_behind_minwax_paste_finishing/,Reveal the Truth Behind Minwax Paste Finishing Wax Results,"Woodworking projects have always been part of my household hobbies, and it seems like a natural extension of my interests to try the Minwax 785004444. This paste finishing wax, often presented as a staple for woodworking enthusiasts, caught my attention after diving into several pieces of furniture restoration, ranging from modern wooden tabletops to heirloom antique chairs. I‚Äôll admit upfront, this is one of those products that leaves an impression but comes with some considerations.

**Ease of Application and Design**  
Using the Minwax paste wax felt straightforward from the beginning. The small, 16-ounce container is perfectly sized and easy to store without feeling bulky. It has a natural finish that aligns well with most wood types, an essential feature if you‚Äôre moving between different projects like I am. The instructions are refreshingly simple: clean the surface, spread a thin, even coat, let it dry for ten to fifteen minutes, and polish it with a cloth or buffer. For someone like me, who switches between manual effort and electric polishers depending on the day, this flexibility was a big win. However, one extra step of thorough surface cleaning is crucial‚Äîskipping it can leave you with blotchy streaks.  

**Performance and Finish**  
The results this paste provides lean heavily toward achieving that hand-rubbed luster the company boasts about. After applying it to an old cabinet in my living room, it managed to highlight the natural tones of the wood while giving it a subtle, polished glow. It‚Äôs not just about its look, though; the product also adds protection. However, I found it suited more for pieces that don‚Äôt require heavy, protective coatings like polyurethane. That being said, furniture that's more decorative like a coffee table or antique display cases truly benefits from its elegance.  

[Check Minwax 785004444 price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b000lnozaw/)

**Versatility in Use**  
I tested it on multiple surfaces, including a newly sanded oak panel and a slightly weathered pine end table. The consistency worked perfectly on both, and the wax was relatively forgiving, even for someone not aiming for a professional-level finish. It‚Äôs ideal for interior use whether you're restoring furniture like chairs and tables or polishing woodwork, doors, and cabinets. You shouldn‚Äôt, however, expect miracles on outdoor furniture‚Äîin my experience, this product isn‚Äôt designed for environments with exposure to moisture or rugged wear.  

**Good Points**  
- Effortless application and polish with minimal tools required  
- Creates a classic, natural aesthetic that enhances wood grain  
- Quick drying time means projects don‚Äôt drag on endlessly  
- Versatile formula ideal for vintage aesthetics or everyday woodwork

**Areas of Concern**  
- Not suitable for heavy-duty protective needs or outdoor use  
- Must prep wood meticulously, or results can appear uneven  
- Limited to interior surfaces only  

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve worked with products like Howard Feed-N-Wax and Briwax in the past, and while they share similarities with Minwax‚Äôs offering, the differences are notable. Take Briwax, for example‚Äîit excels in giving wood depth and color while layering slightly more protection than this paste wax. However, its odor might turn some people off (my partner strongly preferred Minwax in this regard). On the other hand, Howard Feed-N-Wax adds superior moisture reinforcement but trades away that sleek, refined finish Minwax delivers. If aesthetics and ease are your leading criteria, this product delivers precisely that.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
When comparing its overall price point with similar finishing waxes, I found the Minwax to sit in a reasonably fair range. Considering its application ease and satisfying results on non-hard-wear surfaces, it provides decent value. Investing in something like this makes sense as long as one adheres to its intended use cases‚Äîif you're tweaking antique furniture for better visual appeal or simply protecting cabinets and paneling, it‚Äôs worth the spend.

Here are the 5 foundational, zero-cost biohacks that actually work.","Hey everyone, Like many of you, l've spent countless hours listening to podcasts and reading articles about health optimization, only to feel completely overwhelmed. There's so much information, and it's hard to know where to even start. I decided to dedicate the last few months to synthesizing all this research into a simple, actionable framework. I wanted to share the 5 most powerful, zero-cost habits that have made the biggest difference for me.
1. View Morning Sunlight Within 30-60 Minutes of Waking (10-15 mins) ‚Ä¢ Why it works: Morning sunlight exposure is the single most powerful signal for setting your body's 24-hour circadian clock. It triggers a healthy cortisol pulse that gives you sustained energy and focus throughout the day and properly times melatonin release for better sleep at night. 11] ‚Ä¢ How to do it: Go outside and get natural light in your eyes. Don't look directly at the sun. Don't do it through a window or with sunglasses on. If it's a cloudy day, you'll need 20-30 minutes.
2. The ""Physiological Sigh"" for Instant Stress Reduction ‚Ä¢ Why it works: This is a breathing pattern highlighted by Dr. Huberman that immediately offloads carbon dioxide and activates the parasympathetic (calming) nervous system. It's the fastest way to bring your stress level down in real-time. [1] ‚Ä¢ How to do it: Take two sharp inhales through your nose (the second one should be smaller, just topping off the lungs), followed by a long, complete exhale through your mouth. Just one or two cycles can make a huge difference.
3. Cold Exposure (Even a Cold Shower Counts) ‚Ä¢ Why it works: Short, controlled stressors like cold exposure (a process called hormesis) trigger a massive release of norepinephrine, which dramatically improves alertness, mood, and resilience. It also activates brown fat, which can improve metabolism. [1] ‚Ä¢ How to do it: End your regular shower with 1-3 minutes of pure cold water. Focus on your breathing to get through it. You don't need a fancy ice bath to get the core benefits.
4. Delay Caffeine for 90-120 Minutes After Waking ‚Ä¢ Why it works: When you wake up, your body has a buildup of adenosine, which causes sleepiness. Your morning cortisol spike is designed to clear this out naturally. If you drink caffeine too early, it just blocks the adenosine receptors without clearing it. This leads to the dreaded afternoon crash when the caffeine wears off. Waiting allows your body to clear it naturally first. [1] ‚Ä¢ How to do it: Simple. Just wait 90 minutes after you wake up before having your first coffee or tea.
5. Create a Cool, Dark Sleep Environment ‚Ä¢ Why it works: Your body needs to drop its core temperature to initiate and maintain deep sleep. A cool room (around 18-20¬∞C/65-68¬∞F) facilitates this. Darkness is crucial for melatonin production, the hormone that governs sleep.
11] ‚Ä¢ How to do it: Use blackout curtains or an eye mask. Cover any light-emitting electronics.
Turn down your thermostat at night. These 5 habits alone are game-changing. The biggest challenge is putting them all together consistently. For anyone who wants a fully structured approach, I compiled all my research-from sleep and nutrition to advanced topics like NAD+ and senolytics-into a complete 30-day implementation plan called ""The Biohacking Code."" It's designed to be the bridge from learning this stuff to actually doing it. You can check it out here:

I had two favourites that I bought regularly at Auchan, but it seems now they are never in stock. So being the caffeine junkie I am. I came to the idea of trying to buy one of these coffees in bulk to last me a year (around 15kg).

First place I looked was the coffee brands directly. But the first (both in Italy) told me they don't ship to Poland for less than 100kg and the second told me the don't ship to Poland at all.

Thus Allegro was my next call and to my suprise both the coffees where available at a price difference of only 3zl less for one and 2zl more for the other. Which got me thinking about everything else in my favourites or regular purchases. Everything was basically the same, only a few z≈Çoty difference at best for items priced close 50zl.

When I called the first coffee company they told me the mark up per kg was 45zl (after euro exchange). Which means the Allegro seller, assuming they got it for that price and didn't pay shipping costs, is only making 7zl before taxes and fee's.

So how are these sellers making profit? Is it really only 3-5zl they're getting per item? Or is there some secret inter-european wholesale warehouse that sells everything dirt cheap?

I am new to CS2, having just bought and installed on my PC.  I have played CS1 for years on Playstation 5, and prior to that SimCity 4 on my old Mac Pro workstation.  I liked the concept of regional play with an updated game engine and some of the mods like 529 tiles and MapExt allowing for a wide region.  I first attempted to get a .PNG created of the greater St. Louis area (where I am from) to build my first region from the USGS - it looked like I was living in the Swiss Alps when I imported that file lol.  So I then found [terraining.ateliernonta.com](http://terraining.ateliernonta.com) that will help create a CS2 map and associated files (like open streets to use with the overlay mod).  This map is much better, but still, something is not right.

  
I want to basically create 2 PNG files that will fit in the largest region using the mods I mentioned above, one for the heightmap, and another for the over lay so I can create some of the regional features I want to build in myself.  I have tried literally for the last 3 days and it's always a little off and doesn't match.  What am I doing wrong?  How can I download the exact same map for example, and when I overlay the scale is off?  And for some reason, the size of the PNG file is not matching with what gets rendered on the CS2 editor?  I am interested in starting this region, but would love to eventually do some other regions as well, so this is crucial for me to understand my missteps.

  
Lastly, as an aside...this latest render does work much better and doesn't appear that St. Louis is in the Alps...but I will put boarder water in the riverbeds, and they fill up, only to empty halfway on the map?  So weird!  For the rivers, the ""constant height"" mods don't give enough water, and the ""constant rate"" mods seem to overflow the banks even if there is empty riverbed in either direction.  When you turn the rate down, this can be alleviated, but as I let the editor simulation time go (I want to make sure the water is correct before finalizing the map), it will do weird things like go dry in February.  I'm at a loss with this too.



Perhaps my solution is to find someone adept at map creation and donate a bunch of coffee and snacks to create my first map for me?  Thanks in advance for any help you can offer to get me going on my very first CS2 build! ",1,1759509188.0,CitiesSkylines2,0,1.0,False

Our preferences all differ slightly but what we have always looked for is the perfect blend of crunchy, buttery, flaky, and fulsome- the layers should all come together for a smooth experience.

Here are some places we have tried so far, with an overall score getting from my mother, me, and my sister in law.


Pompette - 7.5: We all agree this is one of the most solid ones out there, my mom found it dry so it dragged down the score a bit. My personal second favourite.

Barbershop 7.8: Feels like an underrated spot! Great small outfit putting out a delicious butter croissant. 

L‚ÄôAmour 7.8: Another great one, they run out of croissant pretty quickly, I did not care too much for this one, it was missing a bit of a crunch but this place had the best ‚Äúalternative‚Äù croissants and other pastries. 

Blackbird 6.6: One of my least favorites personally but my family liked it. It was dry, no crunch, no texture‚Ä¶ for me it‚Äôs only really better than what most chains are offering. 

Brodflour 8.3: This is a very popular spot and I can see why. Best coffee so far, and everything they had on offer looked tasty. The plain croissant hit all the marks for us. 

Castle & Coal 7.0: The most ‚Äúgood‚Äù croissant out of all them. We all gave it the same score, it just was not anything special. IMO a golden standard though, as in, your croissant should be about this good as a starter and you try to improve it. 

Robinson Bread 8.5: We all agree this was the best one. Tasted fully baked, was buttery but not oily, crunchy, layered‚Ä¶ just everything you would want in a croissant. So far‚Ä¶ could it be better in Toronto? We want to find out so please share your recommendations and thoughts!

My friend (""TDog"") and I hiked Mount Kilimanjaro a few weeks ago for his birthday!

We found a lot of helpful information from Reddit, especially [""8 Day Lemosho Report""](https://old.reddit.com/r/kilimanjaro/comments/1jriyb8/8_day_lemosho_report/), [""I Climbed Kilimanjaro AMA""](https://old.reddit.com/r/kilimanjaro/comments/1b337oo/i_climbed_kilimanjaro_ama/), and [""7Day Lemosho Trip Report""](https://old.reddit.com/r/kilimanjaro/comments/1etqh8q/7day_lemosho_trip_report/), so I thought to give back with as much information as I could.

The top sections are broken down by category, then some miscellaneous and personal notes/suggestions at the bottom.

# Equipment
The mountain has so many climates and environments, and its weather can change unbelievable quickly.  This was new to me!  It could be sunny and warm one minute, but 15min later the clouds have come in and you're shivering from cold damp air.  Summit night brings its own challenges.  So you really do need to pack correctly!

I rewore a lot of my clothes, and they were very dirty by the end of the trip.  Personally I think it is impossible to stay clean on a 7-day hike, so why bother trying?  Embrace the grime and save your porter a little weight by rewearing instead of packing more!

### Details
|Item|Count|Necessity|Brought/Rented|Notes|
|----|-----|---------|--------------|-----|
|Thermal base layers|2 pairs of top + bottom|Necessary|Brought|Wool/bamboo(?).  I used both pairs on summit night and to sleep in one night|
|Underwear|7|~5 are necessary|Brought|-|
|Socks, thick|2|Only 1 is necessary, for summit night|Brought|Wool|
|Socks, thin|5|~3 are necessary|Brought|Summit night you'll need at least one thick sock with one thinner sock.|
|Trousers for hiking|1|Necessary|Brought|-|
|Trousers for rain & wind|1|Necessary(?)|Rented|Our guides required this.  Started morning hikes with it over my hiking trousers and took off on the trail.|
|Snow pants|1|Necessary|Rented|Fleece-lined thick snow pants.  Threw these on at night/dawn to wear around camp.|
|Shirt, short-sleeved|1|Necessary|Brought|Lightweight, breathable shirt.  Wore this every day.|
|Shirt, long-sleeved|1|Personal preference|Brought|Lightweight, breathable shirt.  I used this summit night but don't know if it made a difference versus if I had just worn my short-sleved shirt.  In retrospect, I wouldn't have brought this|
|Sun hoodie|1|Personal preference|Brought|Lightweight, breathable sun hoodie.  Wore this every day.  If you like outdoor activities like hiking and *don't* have one of these yet, consider getting one.|
|Fleece/Sweater/Jumper|1|Necessary|Brought|Used this as the first response to daily cold weather.  Threw this on at night/dawn to wear around camp.  Started morning hiking with it but took off on the trail.|
|Snow jacket/buffer|1|Necessary|Rented|Definitely necessary for summit night.  Threw this on at night/dawn to wear around camp.|
|Gloves/mittens, thin|2|1 is necessary|Brought|I brought one pair very thin gloves and one pair thicker mittens.  The thin ones were helpful for sun protection but probably not necessary.  The thicker mittens were sufficient for summit night but left my fingers a little cold at times.|
|Gloves/mittens, thick|1|Not sure|Rented|Thick leather mittens with inner lining.  Our guides required that we rent these, but I did not end up using them.|
|Hat/cap|1|Necessary|Brought|It is very sunny about half of the days.  Hat + sun hoodie = ultimate facial sun protection!|
|Warm hat/beanie|1|Necessary|Brought|Wore this some days instead of hat if the weather was cold.  Necessary for summit night|
|Neck covering/buff|1|This or scarf|Brought|Useful for sun and dust protection, necessary for cold.  Mine was too thin, so I had to wear the scarf over it.|
|Scarf|1|This or neck covering|Brought|See above|
|Hiking boots|1|Necessary|Brought|It only rained briefly one time, so waterproofness was not a concern.|
|Hiking sandals|1|Not necessary|Brought|I like hiking in sandals sometimes.  With a pair of medium-thickness socks, it wasn't too cold to hike with them.|
|Hiking poles|1 pair|Personal preference|Rented|I rented a pair and used them ~2/3 of the time.  There are sections that are difficult to use them in, but the majority of the trail I found it helpful to have.|
|Head lamp|1|Necessary|Brought|You need one for summit night, plus it is generally helpful to have in the evenings|
|Sleeping pad|2|Personal preference|Brought & Rented|The porter company supplies one sleeping mat (~5cm thick mattress), and I brought another of my own, per recommendations from Reddit.  I think it is worth to bring, especially if you have trouble sleeping outdoors anyway|
|Sleeping bag|1|Necessary|Rented|-|
|Backpack|1|Necessary|Brough|~25L is an appropriate size.  You shouldn't carry too much yourself, so this is really just to hold rain gear, an extra warm layer, water, snacks, and whatever else you like to have when you hike.  For reference, I had a North Face Dyno 29L backpack ([this one](https://threadfellows.com/products/the-north-face-dyno-backpack))|
|Duffel bag|1|Necessary|Rented|Provided by the guide company.  This is where you put everything you don't carry for the day, and a porter carries it between camps.|
|Tent|1|Necessary|Rented|Provided by the guide company|
|Ibuprofen|~50|Personal preference|Brought|Good pain reliever.  We donated some to the porters on the final couple of days|
|Acetaminophen/paracetamol|~50|Personal preference|Brought|Good pain reliever|
|Acetazolamide (Diamox)|~25|Recommended|Brought|Ask your doctor and your guide.  If you have no contraindications, I would definitely recommend taking this|
|Benadryl|~50|Recommended|Brought|It was helpful to take this as a sleep aid|

### Owner/Point of Contact
Erik, the owner, was super responsive.  He answered emails within 48hr, usually same day.  He was always professional and was patient when our wire transfer deposit failed.  Though he did give a lot of info ahead of time, we did have to ask questions to get more specifics about a few things like equipment, food, and logistics.  He met us in person before and after the hike to greet us and chat.  Joining Safaris is a family business - his daughter drove us around Moshi after the hike, and his wife gave me a ride to the airport!

### Guides
Our guide, Geha (""G""), and assistant guide, Asha, were good.  They knew the mountain and its trails, kept us aware of what the plan was each day, had fun facts about flora/fauna, and adapted the pace to our health and condition.  They chatted a little bit and opened up when we asked about themselves but were not very talkative.  I don't speak any Swahili, but their English was good enough to communicate everything we needed to know about the hike plus some casual conversation.

Since we were only two clients and demonstrated decent fitness, they usually kept the pace pretty quick.  We passed many other groups along the trail, often going off the main trail to go around slower groups.  The only issue I have with this is when we were descending from the summit, they really pushed us to get down to base camp quickly.  TDog and I were both very tired and our knees ached, but they kept 

At the beginning and end of each day, plus a time or two on the trail, they asked how we were feeling and if we were experiencing any symptoms of altitude sickness.  They carried supplemental oxygen with them, but no medicine or first aid that we could see - when one of the porters was suffering stomach pain, they asked _us_ for ibuprofen.  My friend also requested acetazolamide the night before we departed but did not get any despite assurances that they'd get it for us.

### Porters
Porters are superhumans.  They carried so much, so easily, and in such difficult terrain.  It was really humbling to see them running along the trail with huge baskets on their heads while we gasp for air taking tiny steps.  All the merchandise saying ""I climbed Kilimanjaro"" should really say ""a group of 10+ porters got me to the summit of Kilimanjaro"".

The men (there were few female porters on the trail) in our group were nice but mostly kept to themselves.  One or two would poke their head in our tent area to make sure we were alright, but otherwise we didn't interact much with them.

### Food
Our cook, Jamal, was great!  It was unbelievable how he could make such good food in such harsh conditions.  All the food was hot, which was really nice when it was cold outside.

* Hot coffee/tea as soon as you wake up (literally, B handed it to us while we were still in our sleeping bags)
* Breakfast
    * Porridge
    * Toast
    * Pancakes
    * Fruit
    * Eggs
    * Potato-egg omlette that I'd order for breakfast tomorrow morning if I could, it was so good
* Lunch & Dinner
    * Soup
        * Pumpkin
        * Potato
        * Vegetable
        * Zucchini?
    * Fried chicken + french fries/chips
    * Vegetable slaw
    * Rice with vegetables + sauce
    * Spaghetti with vegetables, meat + sauce
    * Fried vegetable fritters

There was also instant coffee, tea, powdered milk, and powdered chocolate milk (Milo brand if you're familiar) available at our table all the time.

By day 6 we were getting a little tired of the same vegetable sauce, but I can't complain, Jamal did an amazing job with limited ingredients and equipment.

### Company-specific equipment
Different size companies have different size tents.  The bigger companies had giant tents that seemed to act as a common area/dining area for all their clients.  We were just 2 clients, so we had a 2-person tent with porch that looked like [this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1h-5jA2ViL._SL1500_.jpg).  The porters set up a small table and two chairs in the porch, which is where we ate.

Not all companies provide portable toilets.  I think each campsite has toilets, but depending on where your group sets up camp, it could be a couple minutes to walk there.  We had a private portable toilet that was set up in a small tent each day and it came in handy.

# Schedule/Route breakdown
Here are our stats as logged by TDog's Garmin watch and posted on Strava.  I don't claim these are 100% accurate.  This is only _moving time_, not total time on the trail that day (i.e. he paused his watch when we stopped for lunch or long breaks):

|**Total**|**63.11**|**16800**|**4545**|**20h 29m**|


### Day 1
Easy start to the mountain!  Not too long or too steep.  Dense jungle with monkey sightings if you're lucky.

### Day 2
Ramping up quickly!  This is actually two days combined into one - there are two camps called ""Shira"", with the second one across the plateau plain from the first.  We were encouraged to continue on from Shira I to Shira II, which was a mostly-flat 10km walk.

### Day 3
Really starting to feel the elevation this day.  This is an important acclimatization day where you hike above where you will later sleep so that your body begins to adapt.  There is a landmark called ""Lava Tower"" at 4600m above sea level which you walk to, stay at for an hour or so, then continue on down to the next camp.  4600m is also the elevation of the base camp, so it's a good litmus test for guides to see how clients will fare then...

### Day 4
Now we start tapering off to prepare for summit night.  This has a cool/fun/exciting/thrilling/scary/dangerous section of climbing with hands+feet.  It seems like there is always a traffic jam here since everybody has to slow down and maneuver carefully.  Watching the porters here as they somehow balance baskets, backpacks, stoves, tents, and jugs of water _while climbing up the side of the wall_ was incredible.

### Day 5
Very short day with lots of time to rest.  The landscape here was amazing and there's a great cliff that juts out over a small valley.  The rocks must have changed composition at this point because some make a pleasant clinking sound when you strike them with your hiking pole or when they hit each other underfoot.

### Day 6 (Summit night)
This part is really hard.  Drink lots of water, maybe chew on some snacks, and try to keep moving.  I put in my headphones at 0415 to listen to music and I think that saved me.  It took us just under six hours to reach the peak, and we were definitely on the quicker side.

There is absolutely no shame in handing your pack to a porter or guide - their bodies are _much_ more adapted to the mountain, and it's like G told us: ""When you tell someone 'I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro', who is then going to ask 'Did you carry your backpack all the way?"". 

### Day 7
* Final push!  Our legs felt a bit recovered from the previous day so we could finish strong.  The trail becomes less rocky and more like packed dirt, so you can move a bit quicker.
* Parting ceremony + tipping announcement
    * This company, like others, has you announce out loud, in front of the whole group, what you are going to tip each guide and porter.  The guides helped us pick amounts that would not upset the porters due to inequality.  Still, TDog and I found the tradition uncomfortable.
    * Be sure you have enough cash!!  I forgot I had a daily ATM withdrawal limit and couldn't get enough cash after the hike was over!  Luckily the hotel was able to front me some money until the next day.

### Terrain
I don't remember the terrain being difficult.  There is one short section on day 3 that requires hands for climbing, but otherwise it is fairly easy ground (no loose earth or jagged rocks).

---
# Miscellaneous/Personal thoughts
### Snacks
Although your cook will prepare plenty of food during meal time, I'd recommend bringing snacks of your own.  Energy bars, gummies, and gels for the trail are one thing, but snacks for camp are a different one.  I wish I had brought/purchased more savory and salty snacks instead of just sweet.  For instance, TDog had Pringles and beef jerky.

### Other
* Charge your headlamp, phone, batteries, headphones, etc. before you go!
* I purchased a 1-week 2GB eSIM through Vodaphone Tanzania.  This was more than enough data.  I think I had semi-reliable service on day 4 and 5, but otherwise it was weak and intermittent.
* Because the nights are cold and the camps are spread out, there wasn't much mingling between clients of different companies.  I counted over 130 tents at just the first campsite, before the Lemosho trail merged with the Machame or Umbwe routes.  If you're expecting to meet other backpackers at camp, it might be harder than you expect.
* Due to unfortunate flight cancellations, TDog and I ended up being the only ones in our group.  We get along well and enjoyed catching up but agreed it would've been nice to have another couple people with which to chat, share the experience, and get/give encouragement from/to on summit night.
* You will probably share a tent with someone for six or seven days - make sure you get along with them.
* I was very worried my body wouldn't handle the altitude well - when I visited Cusco in Peru I was bedridden because of a crippling headache.  I started taking acetazolamide (Diamox) 1.5 days before the hike.  On the trail it was one dose with breakfast and one dose with lunch (I think 250mg but am not sure).  I only had symptoms briefly on day 3.
* TDog and I are both fairly active/health-minded.  For reference, a 10km run wouldn't be too difficult for us (at low elevation, that is).  We both enjoy hiking and camping and do it a few times per year.  Sincerely, I don't think it matters _that_ much.  Because of the slow uphill pace, it was more about willpower and mental fortitude than physical aptitude.
* Your team will probably stop at a market or store before going to the trailhead.  This [""Kenyan Chevda"" snack](https://www.gosupps.com/media/catalog/product/cache/25/image/1500x/040ec09b1e35df139433887a97daa66f/9/1/91YqaZyCGxL._AC_SL1500__1.jpg) in ""Chili Lemon"" flavor was awesome
* If you have extra time in Moshi before/after your hike, consider going to [Materuni](https://materuni.com/) for its waterfall and cultural experience, which includes authentic lunch and a coffee-making class.  This was an unexpected gem for us!",5,1759508760.0,kilimanjaro,1,1.0,False
1nx3t6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/aclfestival/comments/1nx3t6h/beware_the_monks_of_stoke_today/,Beware the Monks of Stoke today,"This morning I was at Radio Coffee on Manchaca and this weird ass group called the Monks of Stoke was being weird and invasive toward people.

As I paid more attention it is some evangelical group here for a ‚Äúharvest‚Äù as they put it. They will be roaming ACL in tie dye. 

They come in bad faith. A woman and a man in line behind me were mocking trans and LGBT people because Radio has a sign on the door about ‚Äúall being welcome‚Äù.

Vampires drink blood, Werewolves could accidentally obliterate a preschool if someone spills coffee on them, and Mages have to worry about not opening up black holes with every spells they cast.

Zealotry? Vampires all have it coming, without exception. One day, I'll grow out of this terrible, awful brainworm, but until I find the book and lore evidence that proves that a vampire can be more or different from a rapist demon of various degrees of self-delusion, I stay with this.

Mass murder? You can be absurdly selective with your actual targets, and even make friends among the more benign splats. Frankly, I imagine such a thing is very common with HTR5 PCs, as my belief in the human capacity for love makes me think that average joe who picked up a stake after his friend disappeared wouldn't try and incinerate a Mage just for being a Mage.

Sure, they act like the Punisher, and have all of Frank's derangements and brutality, but the people they're doing to, apparently, have it all coming. By this logic, aren't they just the shining paragons of the setting?",4,1759508601.0,WhiteWolfRPG,61,0.57,False

What are some ideas on how I can facilitate this? I run the talent show in my school and that's easy, everyone gets 3 minutes to perform their act and then on to the next one. Should I run this the same way? Should I audition/preview all acts to keep things organized? I figure it'd be open to music, poetry and readings.

Working in the social field (like health care, youth welfare and special needs) for many years now. Right now I work in a psychiatric clinic to further broaden my horizon and to prepare for additional exams and trainings.

We got a new ""hire"" (a 1-year-internship with educational weeks off, designed for the age 16-26) and this person is someone I absolutely cannot stand. She's rude, she's breaking every rule about how to interact with colleagues (especially older/more experienced ones), does disgusting stuff (like handing out food to patients without gloves and pawing it with her bare unwashed hands).

I tried to be the graceful senior telling her in private, that stuff like this is absolutely disgusting and nasty and that she can feel lucky I'm telling her in a friendly manner, other colleagues would have torn her a new one.

Cause we have patients who are allowed to leave the ward for a while and some who are absolutely forbidden from leaving (cause they would be a risk to themselves or the public right now) we have a ""bouncer position"" at our door. At all times a colleague has to sit there and check who's coming in and who wants to go out. Most people don't like this part of the job, cause it can feel isolated and you always have to ring someone to take over even if you just need a short pee break.

Every time I had a shift with ""boss babe"" I asked her to take over for a minute or two, so I could use the restroom or grab something I needed. Every time she said, that she will do it and in the end left me hanging. Like she needed to prepare a meal for a patient (not giving them the food, just prepare!) and was gone for like 15-20 minutes. To but some butter and chocolate spread on 2 slices of toast. ü§® So either she's too incompetent to fix a slice of bread or she's a lazy shit. I will let you guys judge.

It got better. I learned many years ago to write the opening date on stuff I'm handing out. Like coffee cream, milk for cocoa, etc. But also on hygienic products like disinfectant wipes, cause they have to get discarded if they get too old.

I sat at the door and she stormed out of the kitchen to berate me, that there were wipes which weren't dated and that I should do this. And she had the audacity to do that in front of patients. I later grabbed her and told her, that if she ever pulls such shit again (in front of patients) I will talk with our supervisor and she will get kicked out for not being compatible with this kind of work. Meaning, she would never get a job in (psychiatric) healthcare ever again, as long as it's not wiping the floors.

I later heard her also gossiping about colleagues and our sexual orientation. Like duh, it's nothing that should concern you, so shut the f... up.

Best was 2 days I got to work and needed to search my shoes. The little ""boss babe"" liked my locker and just decided it's hers now. Luckily I brought a good locket.

Now the petty revenge: My locker is mine again and her shit is locked in with my work shoes (which can be nasty at times) and if she wants it back she has to tell our supervisor why she thought it's ok to just claim a locker that's not hers, just cause she liked the position.",48,1759508522.0,pettyrevenge,10,0.91,False

2 of my supervisors talk to me like i'm braindead


Just for context I have ADHD and im getting diagnosed for chronic pains which is starting to look like arthirits right now.

I 20M (trans) have almost been working in this store for 1 yr, I started as a Christmas temp, I got taught the basics but nothin else.

Everytime theres a stock rotation, you know the seasonal stock, I dont get told I end up figuring it out myself.

I've told my manager every time i have an appt for the doctors I try to be honest with my issues.I used to tell my supervisors when i struggled and needed help, i used to ask them about things when i didnt know them but they started getting impatient with me then they just started getting passive agressive with me.

My first few months I was slow, so the supervisors decided to complain about it. Like im sorry that I started not long ago and now i'm having to do closes..( i was still getting used to the routine )

There is a group of 3 coleauges (consisting of 2 supervisors and 1 team member) that gossip about everyone and it pisses me off. cause my group of friends and the only supervisor that is good has told the manager about it. THE MANAGER DOESNT LIKE THEM AND IS TIRED OF THEIR SHIT...yet nothing has been done about it.
It's stupid, so fucking stupid. they're lke fucking kids.1 of the supervisors complains about evrything anfld anything, if it's busy she complains, if it's dead she complains...

I got a complaint made about me (it's on my profile) which completely broke me and i'm still not ""over"" it (idk how else to explain)

1 of the supervisors doesn't follow the greggs way and does stuff way too early, she washes the coffee machine way before 4pm. she starts washing dishes before 4pm and i mean the closing dishes like the creams tongs (which she actually snatched off of one of my friends...basically she washed it before she needed to, my friemd needed the green tongs and had to find clean ones, when the supervisor saw her with them she SNATCHED them out of her hands..) and one time because she was going on holiday the next day she told me to close asap and that we would leave as soon as we could ( we left 15 mins early ). Told the manager she deducted 15 mins from her shift hours. still no actual consequences though.

I dont know i'm scared of my manager because I have made stupid mistakes. I made a massive stupid aswell when i didnt. hand someone the allergen tablet.

I called in sick the other day but the phone was literally not working so i couldnt call in and now it looks like i onky told them i wasnt in until my shift started and i'm gonna get in trouble.

I admit to any mistakes I make but i struggle with criticism and the anxiety of possibly k!ll!ng someone or putting them in the hospital really scares me, I make too many minor mistakes to be in the food industry and ive got a new job offer i just gotta hand my notice in.

Would ut be ok to just leave the notice in the office for my manager to see the day after?
or do i have to hand it straight to her?

(im in wales btw)
