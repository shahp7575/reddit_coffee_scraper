When I asked her she told me she “definitely wants to but is letting me know she also isn’t looking for anything right now but wants to get to know me”. I’m not upset about it, my intention is truthfully to get to know her as we’ve only talked very briefly before.

My dilemma is that I don’t really know how much talking is too much or what the right amount of effort is for this. I have an insecure attachment style so over committing myself is something I’m actively working on. My therapist told me most friends talk/hangout once a month and that I should wait two weeks to initiate anything else since this is a friendship (this includes texting). Because this is uncomfortable for me I ask for my sister’s opinion and she says getting to know someone includes texting and waiting like that sounds a little ridiculous.

I don’t want to do myself a disservice by embracing that attachment style but I also want to get to know this person more. The other factor is if I’m being friendzoned and I’m already expecting more out of this than what’s realistic. The end goal would be to like each other’s company to the point of dating.",2,1738043405.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1ibut35,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1ibut35/omad/,OMAD,"Hello fellow carnivores. 

Currently I am completely carnivore regarding my food. I have black coffee and electrolytes daily and nothing other than water. I did have milk but I have moved on from that for the time being. 

I am seeing awesome results from individuals doing OMAD but am unsure of how to approach this. Currently I am eating 3-4 streaks of bacon and 3 eggs fried in grass fed butter for breakfast. I only have lunch every few days and it could include steak and eggs or beef mince and eggs. Dinner is perhaps 2 steaks and 2-3 eggs. 

How do I now transition to one meal? Eat 7 eggs, a steak and maybe 200g of mince? I do want to increase my fat intake too if anyone has any ideas. Curious to see how you all go about it. 

For reference, I only eat grass fed everything. Rare occasion I have pork its from farmers I trust. I don’t eat fish because of stomach issues (fish oil tablets atm). Dairy intake is not ridiculously high. I have cut out milk and cream atm and cook my food in butter, lard and ghee. Mostly butter and lard. I have pink Himalayan salt on all meals.

(Help),"Howdy, I'm struggeling to find which direction the white washer (one shown next to the orange o-ring) that forms a collar between the main water pump and safety valve kit (OPV) on this system?   
  
In one direction, is a little lower than flush on the pump side and would be loose when the OPV is tightened. In the other direction, it may form part of the seal or prevent it from sealing.  

Option 1: Flush, not a seal (Collar to stop things sliding around inside the rubber part)  
Option 2: Not flush, the OPV soft washer should compress along with this plastic part.

Any advice from those who know the orientation or at least marked it (as I clearly didnt). Whilst sure I could give it a go, given I could not get my hands on the brass version and the old one snapped (this is a new one) going into a new brass style pump, I don't wish to be without coffee another few days :).

Not lavish banquets, and some books are better for it than others, but pretty consistently she'll mention some recipe that I want to try.  


I've been re-reading Seven Dials (partly because there's going to be an adaptation released, probably later this year, though I don't think Netflix has announced the date yet). 

Karen Pierce's Christie recipe book reminded me that there was a scene with fish and chips, so I remembered to get beer-battered fillets and oven-ready fries as a precaution. I hadn't expected how much fun it would be, to eat those when I started to get hungry partway through the book. Though I wish I'd remembered to get some grapes too, because they're mentioned a couple of times in the story. (Bundle's family grows them in a hothouse on their estate -- luxury!)

I guess another obvious one is jam doughnuts (and muffins!), and Miss Marple's breakfast eggs, for At Bertram's Hotel. Or the Delicious Death chocolate cake from A Murder is Announced. A couple of years ago I made banana and bacon sandwiches after I read about them The Pale Horse, and they turned out pretty well. 

  
And in the middle of The Man in the Brown Suit, Christie mentions coffee ice cream sodas, which I've never had, but they sound pretty good!

The undercooked rice pudding from The Murder at the Vicarage is off-putting, but I'm thinking of trying to make one sometime.

1iburac,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1iburac/how_i_fixed_a_decade_of_insomnia/,How I fixed a decade of insomnia,"I'm posting this because I hope it helps just one person. I know it's stupid long but fixing insomnia is a long process. So if you're really struggling, please read it and let me know your thoughts in the comments.

I've had terrible insomnia for at least a decade (I'm in my 30s now), and about a year ago I finally fixed it and now fall asleep within 15 minutes and sleep an average 8 hours per night. I no longer take ADHD meds either because it turns out that insomnia and anxiety were the cause of most my problems.

In the past, I would regularly lie awake until 2am. I would drink 4-5 cups of coffee every day to get by, and generally live in a state of fogginess. I remember constantly wishing I was dead, because then I could finally get some good rest. Here are three things that I had to address to fix my sleep:

1. Life anxiety
2. Sleep hygiene
3. Sleep anxiety

I used to live in a constant state of stress and anxiety. I was always feeling anxious about every occasion and event, even when there was no reason to be. One evening I stumbled upon the book “Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving” by Pete Walker and it changed absolutely everything.

Long story short, I came to realize that my shitty parents had a bigger effect on me than I realized. I realized that I never spoke my mind, understood my feelings, and was always trying to be a perfectionist to avoid criticism. My fear of being criticized was killing me, and it all finally made sense. I then spent the next few months absorbing every book on psychology (list at the end) that I could and learned a few important things.

The most important thing I learned about is called classical conditioning. I, like most people on planet earth, had heard about Pavlov’s dog, but I didn’t truly understand it. In the end, we are all Pavlov’s dog, constantly being conditioned by our environment. Some of us grew up in shitty homes that require more work than others to recondition. But the brain is an amazing organ that is always rewiring itself.

Here is what I learned. Your brain is always making predictions about the future, based on past experiences, and releases hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline just before it believes you will need them. This process is called Allostasis.

Chronic sleeping problems may begin after stressful life events keep you awake for several weeks. After the stressful event is over though, your brain becomes trained to stay awake and will release cortisol right before bed, assuming you will need it.

This is what scientist Ivan Pavlov discovered in 1909 with his famous dog experiment that we call Pavlovian conditioning, or Classical Conditioning. It’s something all animals, including humans, will do.

Let's say you have a dog. Every time you feed him, you ring a bell. Over time, your dog will associate the sound of the bell with getting food. So even if he's not hungry, when he hears the bell, he'll start to drool because the body will begin preparing to eat, even without seeing any food. This is because you've trained your dog through conditioning. By ringing the bell every time he is fed, you've linked these two things together in his mind. Your dog has learned that the sound of the bell predicts food.

Conditioned events can be unlearned as well. To make the dog stop salivating when hearing a bell, we need to break the association between the bell and food. To do this, we can ring the bell and not bring any food. With enough repetitions, the dogs brain will predict there is no food after a bell and will not salivate after the bell is rung.

Sleep can be fixed in a similar way. You just need a way to instantly fall asleep when you lay down in bed so you begin to associate the bed with good sleep. How do we make someone fall asleep right away? By sleep depriving them. People will always fall asleep if they are tired enough. We can use sleep restriction to make someone become so tired that no amount of anxiety will keep them awake. Do this enough times and Pavlovian conditioning will fix insomnia. The body will stop releasing cortisol right before bed.

This is what happens during Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). Along with sleep restriction, CBT-I also aims to teach you tips and tricks to reduce your stress and anxiety, thus lowering your stress levels in life and before bed, and preventing future sleep problems. Remember, sleep hygiene prevents chronic insomnia, while CBT-I treats it. Insomnia **cannot** be treated with sleep hygiene alone.

Unfortunately I couldn’t find a CBT-I therapist in my town that took my insurance, so I fixed it with an app. First I bought an Apple Watch for $399 (The SE will work as well). Then I signed up for **Stellar Sleep** for $40 per month. It took 3 months and I was cured. It was by far the best money I've ever spent. Stellar Sleep was an amazing app, it monitored my sleep data from the watch and adjusted the sleep restriction training based on actual data. It was also great for learning to journal, do breathing exercises, relax, and be more mindful.

Sleep hygiene is critical to prevent insomnia (but only after CBT-I fixes it). Therefore I’ve cut back to 1 cup of coffee in the morning which has been the most important step (I used to drink 4-5 cups, later in the day). I also don't work late any more and spend time winding down every evening (controlling cortisol is very important).

But most importantly, I am also much much much more mindful of everything and pay much more attention to my behaviors, feelings, and that of others. I'll often ask myself why I feel a certain way, and  realize that my feeling are not always accurate. Sometimes they're the result of my upbringing and conditioning. I view everything through the lens of Pavlov. If something is stressing me out, it means I need to be more exposed to it. The brain will adapt to anything, but it's my job to condition it.

**My recommendation for you:** Buy a smart watch and sign up for Stellar Sleep RIGHT NOW and just do it. Just do exactly what the little owl in the app tells you to do, you won't regret it. Don't worry about the books and all that now. Read them after you've started the program. They make for great reading in the evening instead of the video games, or social media, or other cortisol-inducing habits that are slowly killing you.

Good night, and good luck.

1ibupo3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ibupo3,New to Lexus (UX) & Check Engine Light After Window Tint,"Hey everyone, brief note: 

I joined the Lexus family yesterday 🎉 I came from a Cadillac XT5 and wanted something smaller, but not a sedan, and actual reliability. I love the UX to be very honest, besides the rear, lol. Driving it reminds me a lot of the Miata ND2 I had when I got married, and I am freaking loving it! For those interested in telling me if I got ripped off: 

2021 Lexus UX 250h F Sport with 34,000 miles. One owner from a lease at the Lexus I got it from, so it is L/Certified. I bought the extra warranty (total of six years with unlimited miles and $0 deductible) for an OTD of ~$18k after my Cadillac trade in ($14k). It is in pristine condition, as expected, and I feel quite good about the price. Did my diligent research and could only find one cheaper in a 500-mile radius, but it was white. I needed black and I loved the red interior. 

BACK TO THE POST: 
So yeah, bought the car yesterday and had it tinted today in the afternoon. It only took about one hour and a half for them to tint it and I could actually see it through the see-through tinted windows front the waiting area to the tech service room. It is a good shop and I have tinted half a dozen cars there, so I know they know what they are doing. Thus, I wasn't worried about anything and was instead confused when I got in the car and saw Check Engine Lights and Warnings. I immediately asked the manager, who gave me the keys and certificate, and he said it is quite normal with newer cars since the doors were open for an extended period of time and the windows were rolled up and down a lot. They did keep the car on as needed, but that it was still normal, based on his experience. I know him and trust him, but I also like to trust AND verify. Since I was only literally two minutes away from my Lexus, I decided to stop by the service department.

The manager said all looked good but he wanted to take it to the techs to just make sure. It took a bit since they were super busy but they came back after wiping the code, checking everything, and even washing the car. Everything was super nice and they were extremely nice, didn't have to pay anything and instead got a nice free snack and coffee while waiting. They said all was good and they actually had seen this sort of thing before. He then explained basically the same thing the manager at the tint shop had said. They said it probably would have gone away by itself in a week tops.

I just wanted to post this here in case someone goes through the same issue. I did some more research on it while waiting for the service to be completed. I found one other post describing the exact same as I experienced. One of the top commenters on that forum post said he just cleared the codes himself since he knew it was a common issue. I wouldn't wait a week for it to clear by itself since it shows up on the dash constantly, even if dismissed. Not just the light but a warning, besides the warning on the app and infotainment screen.

AMA if you want 👍 drive safe and enjoy your rides!

A co founder for a tech company reached out to me this morning via email, and we arranged to meet the same day since they were wrapping up interviews. I show up and was surprised to see two guys my age who appeared to be sitting in public somewhere, maybe a coffee shop? dressed in hoodies, mildly disheveled, and as enthusiastic as if it was their 46th interview in a row. They just looked pissed, and the energy was unprofessional as soon as they opened their mouths. The guy I exchanged emails with led the conversation, the other guy was on his phone and didn’t even say hi, acknowledge me, or personally introduce himself. He stayed on his phone, kid you not at one point he even leaned his chin on his arm, reengaging himself here and there to give me the most dissatisfied, judgy look I’ve ever received by someone my age. The guy leading the conversation seemed harmless, but no personability. Their mannerisms were both super improper, looking around when I spoke, lots of leaning, slouching, shifting their bodies, but he was still like a saint compared to his colleague. It was like a facetime call, but in the worst way. 

The guy on the phone finally participated toward the tail end of the conversation to ask me about my current role and past experiences. Without going into detail, he basically phrased every question with a doubtful inflection, insinuating my accomplishments and roles I’ve held don’t match up to the person he sees in front of him. He then followed up with basic interview questions like why sales, and what I got out of XYZ experiences. At that point, I was just at a loss for words, literally looking for the right things to say while they make multiple painfully obvious attempts to hold in laughter. I was obviously mortified that it these weirdos were amused by me, I just gave them the most pathetic word salad I could offer and shut my mouth to end what was a violently uncomfortable interview. Had no questions for them, almost begging them to say bye.

It was challenging for me to handle even as a South Asian who's grown up eating spicy food all their life. Hotpot uses a special kind of pepper called Sichuan Peppercorn. This pepper has a unique numbing sensation along with a lovely aroma. The only reason I left out .5 stars was because I personally found the soup base quite oily and the surimi tasted funny.

Guys. Please try this drink. Yes, it's a bit pricey but my gosh was every sip worth it. The cold coconut milk pairs amazingly with the iced coffee which has a deep, nutty flavor itself. It's sweet without being overpowering and had a refreshing aftertaste that didn't feel too heavy (which I expected because of the coconut milk) but also not too light like you were drinking water. I genuinely wanted to gatekeep this drink because it's just so darn delicious. I had to grab it out of my boyfriend's hands once he got a sip 😭

“I don’t think I have glasses.” Astral sighed, “And here all the effort for some romantic fish and rice, down the drain.” He chuckled.

Ukiko rolled her eyes. “Standard cups will work. And why do you flirt so much?” 

Astral chuckled, “Sorry, it’s a game I play most of the time. See who slaps me and who just walks away.” 

Ukiko peeked back from the kitchen, “Why? Do you want to be alone all your life?”

Astral was silent for a movement before she returned and handed him a glass.

“It’s not just a game, is it?” Ukiko asked softly.

“I'm a soldier in a war that most people, despite knowing this world exists, remain blind to.” Astral sighed, “I’m not meant to have fun or a fam-” 

He looked down as a small head impacted his leg. Ariane was sobbing into his thigh.

“You’re not alone!” She sniffled loudly with a sob, “I’m here. Miss Ukiko is here.” 

Astral sighed and sat in a chair to be as close to eye level as he could be to the girl, “I know. But having people who care, takes getting used to. Gimme some time, okay?” 

Ariane nodded, “I’m tired.” 

“I’ll tuck you in.” Ukiko stood up and took the girl to her apartment. She returned a few minutes later and sighed. “She falls asleep fast at least. Is this your life, chaos?” 

“Life is chaos.” Astral snorted, “It’s people who make order, and we’re usually pretty shit at it.” 

Ukiko sighed and sat down, her spot had a glass and meal which was still covered. She looked over to see Astral’s was as well. She smiled as he poured her some wine.

“None for you?” Ukiko asked. 

“I hate it.” Astral frowned, “Not much of a fan of alcohol. Fruity stuff is okay if I really need to have something.” 

“Angelic Heritage?” Ukiko asked as she watched him give a small silent prayer before starting his own meal, he simply had a can of soda by his meal.

“Nah, just never did like it. Which is weird since my dad comes from a heavily German family. Well, came from.” Astral smirked, “Look, if you want me to stop flirting, I will. You’re just the first to actually poke back.” 

“I don’t need you to stop and it is fun to have someone who thinks as quickly as I do.” She smirked, “But please don’t use it to cover pain. And remember that as long as you’re my client, that’s as far as the relationship goes. Besides being friends.” 

Astral smiled, a little bit of happiness filled his eyes, “I can live with that.” 

“Now, you just told me the Devil was in your apartment and on your side.” Ukiko pointed her chopsticks at him. “Talk.”

“Not the devil, first of all.” Astral said, “Lucifer Morningstar, was god’s highest ranking angel before he rebelled. People think they know why, but honestly I don’t know if we do. But he rebelled and he and his fellow rebels were cast from Paradise down to Earth or to the side. The Location is questionable.”

Ukiko nodded, “So not evil incarnate.”

“No, that’s Abaddon, Daemon King. If he ever gets to Earth we are fucked with a hard capital F. Only the big man can stop him, or Metatron.” 

Ukiko tilted her head.

“Metatron is the King of Angels and the one who sings the prayers of man to the Lord.” Astral explained, “Basically only a King can take out a King.” 

“Gojira.” Ukiko nodded with a raised eyebrow.

Astral laughed with a deep snort, “Yeah, we can dream.” 

Ukiko smiled, “But he’s not evil.” 

“Morningstar isn’t evil, but he’s not exactly on the list of people you’d expect to help out against daemons. Or to help a half-angel, or a train full of humans.” Astral sighed. “Basically he and the Fallen went deep into reclusion when banished here. There are weapons made to kill them, but none have ever been reported to be used, except one.” 

Ukiko nodded, trying to take in all she was being told.

“Back in the Tenth Century there was a knight who used a weapon mended with or blended with the melted nails from the cross. It’s a weapon to kill angels, which the Fallen still are. One of them got into a fight with this knight, killed the poor bastard, but took a heavy wound from him. Left the village he meant to destroy standing though.” Astral mused for a moment, “Weird change of heart, huh?” 

“Maybe this one Fallen finally understood what it was all about? I mean it sounds like this knight gave his life to protect a lot of innocent people.” Ukiko noted with her own thoughtful look. “So these Fallen aren’t evil, not the demons, I mean daemons of myth, what are these Daemons then?” 

“Daemons are what gods fear becoming.” Astral explained. “See, gods have two ways of going out. Big bang and glorious end, or they’re slowly forgotten and molded into something else by people as history changes them. Some can crawl back because they’re never really forgotten or the true memory of them is literally etched into existence, but those that can’t hold on...” He took a breath “Well, they become something hateful and monstrous. It's usually the job of the strongest pantheons or in this particular case, singular God, to protect the world from them.” 

Ukiko paused as she mulled the thought over for a minute. “So he didn’t make the universe?” 

Astral barked a deep laugh, “No, no way in hell. He’s a singular God, that makes him unbelievably powerful. But no one actually knows what made our universe. Churches sure love to say it's Him though.” 

“So what happens when we die?” Ukiko asked.

“There are things, beyond even gods. I’ve seen them a few times, they guide the dead. Most look bored and long dead themselves, but there are a few that you can see the sorrow in their eyes as they take the souls to wherever they’re supposed to go.” Astral shrugged, “Honestly, I don’t know where the dead go when they die, I imagine I’ll learn that exactly once.” 

Ukiko nodded, “Reality is weird.” 

“Yeah...” Astral smirked and nodded, “It really is.” 

“But Jesus was real.” Ukiko stated, “We have proof of that, right?” 

Astral nodded, “Unless the church faked a whole shit-load of evidence, yeah. We have proof. The question most people ask is; was he God in human skin?” 

Ukiko thought for a second, “Maybe he was. Kami do weirder things.” 

“Right, yeah, spirit gods.” Astral sighed, “They’re gonna eat me alive.” 

Ukikio chuckled. “Well, be nice.” 

Astral looked at Ukiko as if she had asked him to walk on a bed of nails. “I’ll try.” 

“And tomorrow, since you can clearly move and I don’t know if I trust this doctor now, we can look for stuff for Ariane for both our places.” Ukiko sighed, “I still don’t know what I was thinking.” 

“You regret it?” Astral asked.

“No, but I can’t explain it.” Ukiko sighed. “If she is a mutant, the government will register her. Or try too.” 

Astral laughed, “I can just imagine the bureaucrat stuck with that job.”

Ukiko smirked at the joke and nodded in appreciation. “You don’t have to be alone, she is right about that.” 

Astral sighed, “I appreciate the concern, but as long as I’m their soldier, I’m more a danger to anyone around me than anything. Especially anyone that gets close to me.”

Ukiko nodded and slowly they finished their meal. Ukiko then left and Astral put the trash in the compactor and walked back to his room. He stood at his window for a moment and pulled out the last crumpled pack of his old brand of cigarettes. One last one remained and it seemed to stare at him, taunting him like a screaming daemon before he punched it out of existence. He sighed and looked up and at the crest of the building next door where he saw yellow-orange eyes looking back at him from darkness. He shuddered and blinked and they were gone. Then he tossed the crumpled pack out of his window and went to bed.   

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

Astral was up before Ariane and Ukiko were the next morning. He was dressed and ready to go almost a full hour before they were and he was happy to be doing so. He knew he couldn’t get too close to this new pair, but he could at least be a friend and he was okay with that. When they came over Ukiko had another cup of coffee and he took it with a smile. 

Their trip started with a visit to the local bedding store. There they arranged a delivery for another futon for Ariane. She chose a sea-green color for her blankets and pillow. She also managed to get an outfit for her Teddy bear as well, it was a raincoat outfit, bright yellow with little boots. 

After that they went to buy her multiple outfits. Astral ended up carrying the bags from that trip. Ariane got multiple dresses in bright colors, mostly blues, pinks, purples and a few orange outfits. Astral was okay with carrying those, it was the hats that she got that he had trouble carrying.

Then they got on the train to head back. That was the time Astral enjoyed the most. He got to watch Ukiko and Ariane bond and he knew they were safe with him around. It was a moment that made his heart lurch and he watched as Ariane immediately locked eyes with him and frowned. Ukiko noticed the girl’s glance and glare.

Ariane got off her seat and sat next to Astral since their car was mostly empty save for a few school kids.  She then hugged him and refused to let go. Astral just stayed frozen like a deer on the road as a semi came hurtling towards it. Except the end wasn’t messy and gore filled, it was Ukiko asking one of the kids for the seat next to Ariane and gently stroking the girl’s hair. Astral was now even more confused, but not unhappy.

He followed them to Ukiko’s apartment and dropped off the clothes and hats. Then he went home and sat on his futon and stared at the wall.

A knock came at his door after a while and he got up and answered it. Ukiko was holding a business card. He took it, it was for a therapist.

“You need help Astral. They don’t own you, and you aren’t alone. I want you to really know that.” Ukiko nodded and smiled. 

“Thank you.” Astral nodded and smiled back, but he couldn’t feel anything as he did so. He closed the door and tossed the card into the compactor and went to bed. 

The next day he mostly stayed in and put Ariane’s futon in the room he had intended to be an office. Then he got the delivery of his desk and computer. He put those in his main room. Then he got a surprise knock at the door. He opened it to see Ariane holding up a bag of candy.

“Come on, I have a show I want to share with you!” Ariane rushed inside and tossed the bag to Astral. 

Astral sighed and followed. The young girl ran straight to the computer and went to the internet, where she brought up several sites and wi-casts. Astral was concerned at one of them being called a Black Sheep something, but he let it pass until he saw it all. Then he saw the show she wanted to share.

“This is Highlight, the Wandering Hero.” Ariane said, “He lost his entire ninja clan to bad guys, but he had all the colors his people left behind to fight with so he’s not ever alone.” 

“Highlight? A highly visible ninja?” Astral laughed.

“He hides in colors.” Ariane grinned, “And he tries to keep everyone alive because he’s seen too many people hurt. He’s a hero. Like you.” 

Astral felt the air exit his lungs. “I’m not a hero, Ariane.” He argued, “I fight daemons because it’s what I was raised to do.”

“But you don’t have to do it alone.” Ariane said, “The Doctor can help. I can when I get older. I can right now too, but Miss Ukiko said it would be too dangerous, but we don’t need to tell her.” 

Astral smirked and lifted the girl up. He sat in the chair and put her on his lap. “Show me how Highlight fights.” 

Ariane clapped her hands together and played the episodes.

Astral wasn’t all that impressed with the show. It was clearly aimed at young children and to teach them the lessons of kindness, hope and creativity. Highlight would always be in a color the bad guy hated and that would mean he would have to get creative since he had to take time to change the color he hid in. Still, Ariane liked the color based character and she enjoyed his multiple, multiple catch phrases, among them “Heroes bring color to the world!” They watched several episodes before Ukiko came knocking on his door and she let herself in.  

“Okay, time for you to go back.” Astral put Ariane on the floor. “I got some work to do.” 

“No.” Ariane pouted, “Doctor said rest!” 

“She’s right.” Ukiko smirked and noticed the show on the screen. “Highlight, national favorite right now.” 

Astral just nodded. “Well then, I better get to resting.” 

“No being sad.” Ariane said, “And especially no thinking that you’re alone!” 

Astral sighed, “You really got a thing for that, don’t you kid?” 

“I can feel it. It hurts my heart just like it hurts yours.” Ariane pouted. 

Astral nodded, “Okay. I won’t let loneliness win. Fair?” 

Ariane nodded and smiled.

Ukiko nodded and made a hand signal for him to make a call. Astral nodded dismissively as the two left. Then he went to his computer and began to search. He wasn’t sure what he was searching for, but he put in everything that seemed to make Ariane upset as well as her powers and vitals. He was sure he tripped at least a few search engine alerts once they began suggesting child care crisis centers. He punched the wall in a brief moment of anger.

Then a voice, crisp, clear and long forgotten to his ears spoke up with only a few words. “Walls don’t hit back, son.” 

He whipped around in shock, his father’s voice was a hard one for him to recall, but he knew it when he heard it. He had recordings and files of his father’s journals after all. He just hadn’t listened to them in years. He paused and stared at the screen, he logged into a website and queued up a journal entry from his father’s old files.

“So...” The voice of the man that was Roger T. Freiheight came on the recording. “Starry thinks it’s gonna be a boy. Not sure if she’s right, but either way it's our first kid. First thing that we both got to really choose to have in this life. No fake options, no lies. Just us. I hope the kid gets to be in a world free of the pests we face. Or the assholes. Mainly the assholes.” 

Astral paused the journal, he had heard it many times before, but never really listened. It had always been fuel to edge his fight training forward. Now though he had to ask, what they had been running from and what they wanted to keep him away from. He hit play again.

“We agreed on Astral if it’s a boy. Not the most traditional name, but it’s a good one especially from a mother named Starry-Night.” Roger snickered as a dough ball hit him on the side of the head. “I deserved that one. But did agree if it’s a girl we would go with Abigail. I guess it’s an A name either way.” He shrugged and a blonde woman peeked onto the screen. 

Astral paused it once more and soaked in the images of his parents' faces. He hadn’t listened to any of these in over ten years. He hadn’t had the time thanks to his assignments. He hit play once again.

“Well, boy or girl, you know we love you.” Starry-Night smiled, her Southern drawl was very prevalent, “And you’ll have these long after we’re gone. Which will hopefully mean there are years and decades of these!” 

Astral blinked, the journals were meant for him. That struck him hard and he felt tears rush down his face. It was the first time he actually didn’t feel alone in some way. He hit another one, a few months later in the files. He needed to hear more.

His father was sitting on a chair, reversed and leaning on the back end. His mother was stitching his father’s back. Two very dark black wings were sprouted from his father’s back. 

“Hopefully, you’ll never have to deal with this.” His father winced, “But chances are you’ll learn about it all. I’m a half-angel, I’m hoping you won’t have this as part of your life, but if you do I’ll teach you everything I can so nothing will stop you. Family motto has to live on, right? “

“He fought a monster called a daemon, they’ll likely be a problem you might have to deal with. Make sure you have a partner, someone to rely on. Someone you can call to pick you up when the fight doesn’t go quite as planned.” Starry-night smiled, “And one that can stitch you up.” She pulled tight on a thread and his father winced.

“Maybe make sure they know what they’re doing too.” His dad winked and flinched as he saw his wife’s hand raise to smack the stitching. “Woman, you are dangerous.” 

“And don’t you forget it.” Starry-Night kissed the back of her husband’s head. “You best be good and set a good example for our little one.” 

Roger Freiheight nodded. 

Astral went to another one, he didn’t care anymore what the date was. He clicked and opened it.

His father was holding a bundled up form. Astral knew it was him.

“So Astral...” His father smiled, “You’re like me. Your wings smacked the nurse in the face. That means I’ll have to keep the Church off your back. They’ll want you harder than a land baron wants a water well in the wild west.” The man sighed, “But you’re worth the fight. Remember it’s never worth it to be quiet. The Word speaks and it is heard.” 

There were a few moments of silence as Astral watched his father watch his tiny form. 

“This life is hard, little one. You need a protector, and I’ll be it until I die or you find a better one.” 

Astral stopped watching and stood up. His chest was tight with rage and sorrow. He had so many questions and nothing to give an answer. Except the internet. He quickly shot to several websites, mostly conspiracy theory sites. Most bandied about the existence of a specific cabal of half-angels being raised to fight daemons more powerful than normal ones. Failures were cast out all together or removed by some form of convenience. He didn’t need that though, he knew that. He was living that. He needed more specific information. 

He posted a topic asking about specific half angels on a conspiracy board for someone called “Threadhead”. It was a simple request if anyone had ever seen the half-angel in the picture. He posted it with an image of his father being stitched up, he removed his mother’s face of course. He got a response almost immediately.

The poster didn’t know his father’s name, but linked to a few images from the years prior to his own birth. It was his father and mother fighting a daemon, but more than that it was a daemon-lord. Astral took in the sight, the thing was the size of a small skyscraper and his father was leveling it with a heavy machine gun that seemed to glow with holy power.

The poster also went on to explain that the church used half-angles as weapons with no regard to their lives. They linked a video to a fight and Astral knew the date linked in it all too well. He didn’t need to see it. He had lived it.

Then came the final piece of information. There were over two thousand half-angels on record, all recorded as heroes under the Vatican and her offices. Not a single one was not associated with them. Astral’s heart stopped for a second, it dropped in sorrow and immediately rose up in anger. He went to punch the wall again but stopped a millimeter from crushing it. He stared and felt a hand on his shoulder that he knew wasn’t there, but he looked anyway. 

There was no one. He took a breath and turned off his computer and went to bed. His mind was too hurt to think and his heart too hurt to be awake. 

**(\o/)-(\o/)-(\o/)**

He woke up to the sound of a small knocking on his door. He got up and opened the door to see Ariane looking up at him.

“Doctor’s outside.” She said with a curious tone. “He’s on the light pole, but no one seems to care.” 

“Get back to Ukiko.” Astral said as he grabbed his coat and headed out after getting fully dressed.

Ariane simply went back into what was now one of her homes.

Astral headed down and out. He looked up and sighed as the form of Lucifer Morningstar looked down on him. He heard the door open and saw Ukiko rush out and stand next to him.

“Ariane said he was back.” Ukiko looked at Astral nervously.

“Yeah, I’m guessing you can’t see him then.” Astral nodded to the light pole. He noted she seemed to refuse to look.

“Oh. She can see me Nephilim.” Lucifer’s tone was playful, like a cat that had found a smart mouse to play with. “She remembers old stories.” 

“He’s fallen, he can’t do that.” Astral snorted. “Not that looking at him is particularly pleasant.” 

Ukiko looked up.

Lucifer Morningstar was dressed in his finest black suit standing on the pole. Great wings, black like the deepest depths stretched against eternity and eclipsing the sun, sinister, yet beautiful and welcoming as the night sky stretched across her line of sight. Eyes like the distorted event horizon of a black hole looked down upon her enveloping her in a beautiful and torrid darkness. His skin was as white as a dwarf star. His hair remained the same from his human form, but there was no mistaking what sat perched above her as remotely human.

She stepped back and he was behind her in a flash. 

Astral immediately pivoted to protect her. The Fallen grinned.

“You are what is needed.” Lucifer clapped his hands. “Good to know. Shall we start training now or would you like to eat and vomit something up later?” He brought his fingers to a point and rested them, playfully, under his nose.

“What the hell are you on about?” Astral snarled.

“You know what I can do to you, Nephilim. But you still put yourself between us. It’s a noble gesture, if futile. Like the subway. I just can’t tell if it’s your human nature or the angelic cause.” Lucifer grinned, “And that is important to know.” 

Astral stood straight and looked at the Fallen, “Why?” 

“Because Angels and their nature will be the fall of man.” Lucifer sighed, “And I’ve come to be attached to the noisy monkeys.” 

“Thanks.” Ukiko snapped.

“You’re welcome.” Lucifer smiled.

“But why are you helping me?” Astral asked.

“Helping you? No this is a test, to see if you’ll be the Church’s little errand boy or if you’ll heed my Great King’s call.” Lucifer said.

“You’re Fallen.” Astral growled. 

“Does that mean I must hate Him for all existence? No, hate died that day as well. Sorrow was all I knew. I sense you’re familiar with that emotion.” Lucifer’s face was grim and stoic and all at once filled with endless sorrow.

Astral hissed with a sharp breath, but didn’t speak. 

“A darkness greater than any I have felt before is coming, one so large it blots out even the daemons. They will need warriors of Paradise.” Lucifer stepped forward, “I can train you in what they failed to.” 

There was a deep and trembling silence.
 
“Ukiko, if I’m not back by tomorrow, send the cops to look for me, yeah?” Astral asked, “Seriously.” 

Lucifer smirked and gave a small laugh. “Make it tomorrow evening, I’m borrowing your Nephilim for a bit here.” 

Ukiko glared at the Fallen but nodded to Astral. “I’ll come find you myself if I have to.” 

“Oh, I doubt that Miss Kanade, you have work to do. If he is to be a Warrior Called, he cannot be held in shackles by the fools in the church.” Lucifer grinned. 

“Are you going to make him a hero?” Ariane peeked her head out of the door. 

Lucifer turned and gave a sweeping bow, “Or break my wings trying!” 

“I feel attacked...” Astral sighed. “Ariane, inside!” 

“Let the child breathe, Nephilim. She has a destiny too.” Lucifer grinned.

“You know what’s going on with her?” Astral asked.

Lucifer nodded.

“Well?” Astral shouted, “Spill it.” 

“No, it’ll be much more fun for you to all find out as a family.” Lucifer smiled.

Ukiko flinched, Astral glared at the Fallen, but he nodded, less in understanding but more in a sense of relenting for now.

“They won’t get hurt while I’m gone, right?” Astral asked. 

“All the girl need do is ask, and I am here.” Lucifer said, shifting his tone to a serious and deadly slant.

Astral nodded. “Ok, let me get my coat off to follow you.” 

Lucifer stared at Astral, “I thought that was the sad case...” He flapped his wings.

Astral blinked and realized that Lucifer’s wings went harmlessly through his clothes. 

“Are you fuckin’ serious?” It was the only response Astral could have.

“Lesson one, your wings are an extension, not of you, but of our Lord’s power. They can pass through any material and remain unharmed and leave the material unharmed.” Lucifer smiled, “It will take time to master, but a slow focus at first won’t hurt.” 

Astral motioned for Ukiko to back up. “If I ruin my coat, you’re getting me a new one.” He pointed at Lucifer.

Lucifer laughed, “Oh heavens, no.” 

Astral glared and Lucifer motioned for him to continue.


Astral focused and tried to imagine his wings passing through his shirt and coat. He felt them rise and press into the fabric but they began to push and tear. 

“It is not a wish.” Lucifer said, “It is a command. You must be firm.” 

Astral nodded and refocused his effort, not just wanting his wings to pass through but expecting them too as if they always had. When he opened his eyes after a few moments of nothing he saw Ukiko’s eyes drawn upward. He looked over his shoulder to see the black wings glowing along the edges with a white light. 

“Why are they glowing?” Astral asked.

“Because you are a light.” Lucifer smiled, “Be proud, but not too proud. He tends to frown on that.” Lucifer smirked and immediately took to the sky. “Show me your speed in the air Nephilim.” 

“Stop calling me that!” Astral said as he followed.

“Make me.” Lucifer grinned and took off at a speed Astral could barely comprehend. 

“Fuck you, OLD MAN!” Astral roared in English as he followed and was immediately sent backwards by the sonic boom that trailed Lucifer’s wake. He shook his head and refocused and followed the Fallen.

Ukiko had stepped back inside and watched several offices in the area lose their windows. She sighed and shook her head as she quickly tried to figure out where to start to help Astral. She didn’t want him to be tied to the Church, it was clear they were just as much a danger to him as any daemon, so she had lots of work to do. 

Ariane just looked up and smiled. “Told you he was a hero.”

It is 11:12 where I live.

Today was my first day at my new job. Really enjoyed it.
Then I came back home, took my dog for a walk and prepared my meal for tomorrow.
Finally I did some exercise and had a 1 hour conversation with my beautiful girlfriend.

Is this how life without porn is? Simple, beautiful.
I am not saying I am not getting the urges from time to time, just that now I disregard them. I see them as not worthy of my time and attention.
I am looking for real experiences. The taste of coffee, the good soreness of the muscles when exercising, petting my dog, a kiss of my girl.
I want to become an addict of reality.

To start, I got a good deal on a second hand Baratza Sette 270 grinder, and got the Delonghi ECP 3420 for Christmas. 

I mostly drink decaf because I don’t like to be dependent on caffeine, but I still love coffee. My problem is I could pull some decent shots with the Delonghi, but with decaf I could never get one that wasn’t sour.  I tried adjusting grind all the way to the finest grind on the Sette 270, tried adjusting tamp, amount of coffee, etc…. I could just never get away from the sour taste accept for one magical shot that came out and I could never replicate. My conclusion is that this machine just didn’t brew hot enough for decaf (in the cup was 160 F). 

Anyone have other suggestions?  I don’t want to spend a ton of $$$$.  I’m hearing the Breville Bambino may be a good option. Anyone else drink mostly decaf?",0,1738041283.0,espresso,4,0.5,False

1ibubhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1ibubhk/am_i_wrong_for_being_annoyed_by_my_friend/,Am I wrong for being annoyed by my friend overstaying their welcome?,"I (27M) recently went out for drinks and pool with my childhood best friend (28M). We used to be really close, but now we only catch up a few times a year. He went through a tough divorce last summer, so I wanted to check in and invited him to hang out at a bar near my apartment.

Afterwards, he wasn’t in a state to drive. To save him the cost of two Ubers (he’s tight on money), I offered for him to crash on my couch. I mentioned that I had work the next day, but my schedule is flexible, so I didn’t think it would be an issue.

The next morning, I got up around 9:30 to get ready. I figured the sound of the shower or coffee maker would wake him up and he’d head out, but he stayed asleep. I started working from my bedroom (my desk is in the living room, next to the couch) and thought he’d wake up soon.

Instead, he stayed asleep all day. By the time I finished work at 6pm, he was still out cold. I wondered if he’d been up all night or something. I was starving by then, so I finally heated up my leftovers from the night before, which woke him up. He walked into the kitchen, saw me eating, and asked, “What’s for dinner?” I only had enough for one meal, so I split it with him. Had I known he was going to stay all day and have dinner I would have taken something out to defrost. He finally left around 7pm.

To me, this felt disrespectful. I offered a place to crash, not an all-day stay. Knowing I had work, I thought it was common sense to leave in the morning once he was good to drive. I didn’t say anything at the time, but it felt like he overstayed his welcome.

I could maybe understand him lingering around after he woke up if he didn’t want to be alone because he was struggling with the divorce and wanted company, but the guy just slept all day. 

When I mentioned this in a TikTok comment section, people called me mean and said I wasn’t being a good friend, especially since I invited him over. Now I’m questioning myself. Am I being unreasonable to think he should’ve left earlier?",11,1738041246.0,amiwrong,7,1.0,False

1ibua8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/emetophobiarecovery/comments/1ibua8n/feeling_anxious_tonight/,Feeling Anxious Tonight,"Like almost everyone else here I’ve been feeling pretty anxious about the recent noro cases. I was doing pretty good until a month ago when I saw on the news that noro cases were surging. I know it happens every year but it still sent my anxiety through the roof. This past spring/summer I had happily been going out and enjoying myself. When I went out to eat I also didn’t think about washing my hands before eating. I even took an international trip to London for a couple of weeks as well. 

Since the end of December though I’ve been feeling like a shell of myself. I’ve gone back to old habits and thinking that everything outside is contaminated. I know healing isn’t linear and some days are better than others for me but overall I’ve been feeling so incredibly anxious that it’s making me nauseous and feel off. I’ve gotten back into the cycle of thinking I’ve caught noro and panicking, only to realize it was my anxiety making everything worse. I also struggle heavily with acid reflux so my stomach in general just is always making a lot of noise/feeling off. Regardless my anxiety has me convinced that my stomach gurgling is because I caught something. 

Tonight I’m feeling especially anxious. I’m thinking it’s because I had a pretty strong coffee with my dinner and it triggered a really bad panic attack. I could feel my heart going like crazy, my limbs felt incredibly jittery and I just overall felt very icky and nauseated. I did have a moment of weakness where I took a Dramamine, which I regret. I know it’s not good to rely on medications when you’re not actually sick, so I’m feeling a little disappointed that I let my anxiety get the better of me. I’ve already been feeling on edge lately since noro has been taking down some of my partners coworkers. We don’t live together and they haven’t shown any symptoms so rationally I know my chances of getting it from them is essentially zero but it still puts me on edge. 

Regardless, I know that whatever happens, happens and that even if I did catch noro or if I get sick I’ll get through it and I’ll be okay. That thought has been helping me the most in getting through this feeling tonight. ",2,1738041128.0,emetophobiarecovery,1,1.0,False

So, we (20M, 19F) met on December 28th. I was at a chicken restaurant with friends when she (19F) came in. After we paid the bill, I went over to her table, complimented her, and asked for her Instagram. She accepted and gave it to me. I messaged her later, saying that we could meet up if she was interested, and she agreed. We arranged a time and place.

Before meeting her, I bought her a bouquet of coquina flowers (since it was New Year’s and every girl seemed to have coquinas in hand) and a 4-pack of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. When we met, she asked for my name because she had forgotten it—I let it slide. Then we went to a Starbucks, where I bought us coffee.

While we were chatting, her phone rang. The caller was saved as ""My little bugggg <3."" She got up to take the call, trash-talking the guy who had called. She mentioned that he was toxic and made a generalization about guys from his country being toxic (she’s a foreigner, and she was talking about my country). However, she added, “But you’re not like them.” (I’m from the same country she had just criticized.)

We chatted for a while, though I started feeling uncomfortable. At one point, she looked at her watch, and I asked if we should leave. She declined, so we stayed and chatted more. After leaving Starbucks, she suddenly said, “I like \_\_\_ street food.” Wanting to be a gentleman, I bought her that street food and even hand-fed her. She seemed happy (understandably, lol).

Since I had invited her on the date, I covered all the costs. Later, we parted ways at the metro station, but not before taking some pictures together. That night, I asked her to send me the photos, and she responded five days later. She ghosted me for a while after that, but then messaged me again. I started replying late too—not days late, but around 10 hours or so.

Eventually, we talked again, and she suggested we meet up. Up until two days ago, I had been posting Instagram stories that made me look rich and bourgeois. She saw the stories but didn’t reply. Then, three days later, she saw one of my stories and messaged, “Where is this place? We should go there together.” I think one reason she replied was because of how I appeared in the stories.

We arranged a time and place for our next meeting. I baked some cinnamon rolls for the occasion. On the day, I picked her up, and we greeted each other with a handshake. Once we got in the car, we chatted. She showed me her nails, I complimented them, and then asked for permission to kiss her hand—she obliged.

When we reached our destination, she connected her phone to Bluetooth and played some music on the way. We unpacked and sat in a park, chatting. I asked what she was drinking, and she said beer, so I bought us a couple of beers and shared the cinnamon rolls. I tried to be as gentle as possible and even brought a poncho in case she felt cold.

We talked for a while, and I kissed her hand, complimented her, and said some romantic and poetic things in her language. At one point, she asked, “Where do you see yourself in 20 years?” I answered something like, “I see myself as a successful businessman or a pilot.”

We spent around 2–3 hours there. Later, she said she was too tired, so I offered to carry her. She said yes, and I carried her part of the way on my back and in my arms. When we got to the car, she mentioned craving sushi. I initially complained about the cost of sushi restaurants but eventually took her to one and bought us a 12-piece sushi platter. Hand-fed her again to be romantic.

We ate and chatted. I paid the bill, and when we left the restaurant, I carried her to the car again (it was across the street). She seemed shy. Since we couldn’t decide on another place to go, I asked if she was sleepy. She said yes, so I drove her home. During the ride, I held her hand. She played “Careless Whisper” by George Michael and even placed my hand on her thigh.

When we arrived, we ended the day with a hug that started with a handshake. I complimented her, saying she smelled amazing, and she blushed. Afterward, I messaged her to check if she’d reached her apartment safely, and we texted a bit.

From a girl who ghosted me for five days, she’s now responding to my texts within a few hours.

In case we met for cinema or bowling should I split the bill? bowling is a little bit more affordable but cinema is too expensive. Help me.

# My questions:

1. Is this the start of a strong relationship?
2. Since I’m a university student with a finite income (I still receive pocket money from my family), how can I politely suggest splitting bills without seeming stingy? I sense that this relationship might become expensive.
3. What are some red flags you notice from my experience?

TLDR;  
Met a girl, asked her out, and paid for everything on two dates (flowers, coffee, food, sushi). She ghosted me after the first date but became more responsive after seeing my Instagram stories. On the second date, she seemed more interested, holding hands and playing romantic music.

Questions:

Could this lead to a strong relationship?

How do I suggest splitting bills without seeming stingy?

Any red flags here?

Many of these businesses—cafes, restaurants, and convenience stores and the commercial real estate — likely lobbied for the return of in-person work, knowing the influx of office workers would boost their profits. Similarly, commercial real estate owners of those office buildings benefit financially from this shift. These entities stand to gain from the drudgery of workers returning to the office, most Fed buildings shabby, dingy, awful workspace/conditions. They are not a Google campus. The whole reason back in 2010 for telework and remote work was to cut costs. Now taxpayer are paying for unnecessary building upkeep, leases, energy, etc. Return to office is to force people to quit for the contractors to absorb (privatize) more jobs. It will decrease the pay overall/hurt everyone and flood the job market.

Instead of supporting the overpriced cafes and sandwich shops near the office, I suggest to still patronize coffee shops and businesses in your local neighborhoods. Bring your own lunch, avoid spending on overpriced office-area meals. The businesses near the office have either thrived during the pandemic or should have adapted by shifting their services to where workers are now—at home or in local neighborhoods. There is no reason workers should continue to support these establishments that profit from forcing them back into inefficient, costly office environments.

All this brings financial burden on workers, who now face long and costly commutes. Whether by car or public transportation, the costs are substantial. Gas prices continue to rise, and frequent driving increases car insurance premiums, while public transit costs and inconvenience remain burdensome. At the same time, federal employees face a freeze on pay, and many private sector workers have stagnant wages, making it harder to offset these added costs.

Federal employees, once seen as vital civil servants, are increasingly vilified as inefficient ""bureaucrats"" by new administration despite earning less on average than their private sector counterparts. The stereotype that federal workers are not productive while working remotely is far from accurate. Many have been highly productive and held to higher standards of accountability while teleworking, and they are now being unfairly targeted. Pushing for their return to in-person work only exacerbates their financial hardships, which are compounded by rising costs of living and stagnant wages.

The decision to force employees back into the office serves only to enrich those who benefit from the return—local businesses and building owners who profit from leases—while burdening workers with higher costs and stress.",0,1738040614.0,fednews,14,0.45,False

The Impact of Color Schemes on Kitchen Aesthetics and Functionality
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The colors in your kitchen can profoundly affect both its aesthetics and functionality. Choosing the right color scheme can create a warm, inviting atmosphere while also enhancing the practicality of the space. When designing your kitchen, it's essential to think beyond mere aesthetics and consider how colors influence mood and usability.

### Understanding Color Psychology

Colors have the power to evoke emotions and impact our behavior. When selecting a color scheme for your kitchen, it's helpful to understand the psychological effects of different hues:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/aesthetic-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Red:** This color can stimulate appetite and conversation. It’s energetic but should be used sparingly to avoid overwhelming the space.
- **Blue:** Known for its calming effects, blue can also be a great choice for kitchens, as it can keep the environment relaxed while creating a sleek, modern look.
- **Yellow:** This cheerful color can make your kitchen feel warm and welcoming. It's perfect for brightening up smaller spaces.
- **Green:** Associations with nature make green a refreshing choice. It promotes a sense of tranquility while reminding us of healthy living.
- **Gray:** A neutral option, gray can lend sophistication and elegance to your kitchen, often paired with bolder hues for balance.

### Color Schemes for Aesthetic Appeal

When curating your kitchen’s aesthetic, the color scheme plays a crucial role. Here are various approaches to consider:

- **Monochromatic:** This scheme uses variations in lightness and saturation of one color. It creates a harmonious look that can make a space feel cohesive and calm.
- **Analogous:** Selecting colors that sit next to each other on the color wheel, such as blues and greens, can create a soothing palette that feels natural.
- **Complementary:** This involves using colors from opposite ends of the color wheel, like blue and orange, which can create dynamic visual contrasts and energize your kitchen.
- **Neutral with Pops of Color:** A mostly neutral palette allows for flexibility. You can accent with bolder colors through accessories, which makes it easy to switch the scheme as trends change.

### Functionality and Practicality

The choices you make in color can go beyond style, impacting functionality in various ways. Here’s how:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/aesthetic-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Light Reflection:** Lighter colors can make a kitchen feel more spacious and airy, especially in smaller or poorly lit environments. They reflect light, enhancing visibility.
- **Stain Visibility:** Darker colors can hide stains better than light colors, making them a suitable choice for high-traffic areas frequently exposed to spills and splatters.
- **Temperature Regulation:** Some colors can also affect temperatures. Lighter colors keep a space cooler, while darker colors can make spaces feel warmer. This can be beneficial in regulating comfort levels throughout the day.

### Accessorizing with Color

Once you settle on a color palette for your kitchen, it’s essential to consider how accessories will tie the room together. Use items like dishware, decor, and window treatments to enhance your aesthetic. Here are tips for accessorizing:

- **Mismatched Dishware:** Consider vibrant, mismatched dishware to add playful hues to your kitchen.
- **Textiles:** Use colorful aprons, towels, or curtains to introduce patterns and texture to the mix.
- **Artwork:** Wall art can be an excellent way to incorporate your color scheme, acting as a focal point in your kitchen.

Ultimately, your kitchen's color scheme can transform it from merely functional to an inspiring space where you enjoy cooking and gathering. By understanding how color impacts both aesthetics and functionality, you can design a kitchen that feels personal, inviting, and practical. Remember, every color choice counts, and the best palette is one that resonates with you and meets your cooking needs.

### Conclusion

Transforming your kitchen into a space that reflects your personal style can be both rewarding and enjoyable. By exploring creative ways to incorporate aesthetic home decor, you can turn this often-overlooked area into a charming and functional environment. You might begin with simple elements like attractive storage solutions, unique wall art, or vibrant textiles that bring warmth and character to the space.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/aesthetic-home-decor-kitchen  
  
The impact of color schemes cannot be overstated; the right palette can enhance not just the look of your kitchen but also its usability. Soft, neutral tones create a sense of calm, making your kitchen a welcoming spot for family meals, while bold, bright colors can inject energy and motivation into your cooking endeavors. These choices affect not only how you perceive the space but also offer practical benefits, such as making it easier to highlight specific areas or aspects of functionality.

Ultimately, merging creativity with thoughtful color choices allows you to reflect your personality while ensuring the kitchen remains a practical space for cooking and gathering. By focusing on aesthetic home decor in your kitchen, you're not just beautifying your surroundings—you're creating a hub for connections, where memories can be made. Embrace the journey of decorating your kitchen, and take pride in the unique aesthetic that you cultivate, making it a true reflection of who you are.

**Personalized “Pull” Recommendations:** Instead of broadly ""pushing"" popular videos to everyone, YouTube now “pulls” content tailored specifically to your viewing habits. It’s all about creating a highly personalized experience for individual users.

**Viewer Satisfaction > Watch Time:** Watch time alone is no longer king. Your feedback, likes, dislikes, surveys, and even how you interact with a video (rewinding or skipping) play a big role. YouTube is prioritizing satisfaction over mere consumption.

**Context Matters:** Time of day and the device you're using directly influence what videos show up. For example, you might get a quick tutorial on your phone during your morning coffee but see a long documentary recommended on your TV at night.

**Multilingual and AI-Driven Tools:** YouTube’s AI now factors in multilingual capabilities to recommend content from creators across the globe, breaking down language barriers more effectively than ever before.

This shift means creators need to think beyond just ""watch time"" and focus on keeping viewers truly satisfied and engaged. Have you noticed a difference in your recommendations lately? Let's discuss!

So we haven’t actually gone for coffee yet. She has said she’s way too busy at the moment with work and a course that she is doing. We have, however, called quite frequently which is nice. We’ve been calling to do work together, so sometimes, we just sit quietly on the phone together for hours. Or sometimes we just spend a lot of time talking and joking around. Although she hasn’t given me an exact date for coffee (because she says she’s busy), she has been making most of the effort to call me as I have kind of kept a bit of a distance (probably me protecting myself). Our calls have been fun, familiar, and very nice. She has been quite flirty at times, but has just been very appreciative of my presence.

During our last call, we got into a bit of a discussion on our dating life and how it’s been. I told her how I’ve been quite happy with dating, have met great people, and haven’t truly had much bad experiences. She, on the other hand, has had a very toxic experience around a year ago. She met a very successful guy and they started seeing each other. Months in, she realized he was emotionally abusive and very disrespectful to her. She stuck around despite this, up until one night in which they had an explosive argument and she called it off completely. She told me how this guy made her very insecure over herself and broke her down mentally, yet she couldn’t get herself to leave. She mentioned that she lost a lot of respect from her friend group, and it seems like she lost some self respect as well. I honestly felt sorry for her. After this experience, she dated another guy for a bit but the two just didn’t click all that well and she called that off too. Since then, she’s sworn off dating to focus on her work and aspirations. We talked some more and I reiterated how much I adored and admired her when we dated, and that it was sad to hear the way she viewed herself after that relationship she was in.

The next morning, we were texting a bit back and forth. She mentioned how our conversation the night prior made her realize how flawed her view of herself is. The toxic guy she was with would make all sorts of negative remarks about her that made her begin to pick herself apart. She said our conversation had her think back to how I saw her during our relationship, and how I really just loved her for her and was accepting of all of her. We talked for a bit more and then the question of us came up. I asked her if she would ever consider us again.

She was firm in saying that now is not the time for a serious relationship and she cannot do that at the moment. She is also hesitant because she is unsure whether we are right for each other and would want to do things perfectly. I said that it was kind of unfair that she kissed me at the club, and continued to be flirty with me over the phone. I told her that, to me, it feels like I’m being strung along a bit. She mentioned that it is comfortable to behave that way because “that’s how we always were” but I told her that’s not right. If we continue that way, it’s only natural that feelings will develop for me and that is going against her supposed wishes of keeping things friendly.

We both got a bit frustrated about this. She says that she wants us to be friends and that she can’t promise anything romantically because:
1) now is not the time for a committed relationship with work and school
2) she holds me in such a high regard that she does not want to take a chance of messing anything up between us. If we were to date, she wants to be certain that it is the right call.

I got upset because:
1) I can’t help but feel like I’m just a comfort for her
2) I’m a bit protective of myself and don’t want to risk the pain of falling for her just for things to not work out.

She asked why we can’t just be friendly and let the pieces fall where they may fall. To me, that makes sense as well but I just can’t help but be scared about getting hurt. After a few days of thinking over things, I can understand that she’s rightfully protective of herself like I am too.

I don’t really know how to go about this. She is right about us being friendly and letting pieces fall where they may. At the same time, I just feel like we’ll fall back into our comfortable way of speaking to each other and feelings will develop for me; I’m just worried that won’t be the case for her too.",2,1738040454.0,love,5,1.0,False

I 24M teach boxing in my spare time, and one day a week, I teach it to kids.

There's a mom who i'm starting to feel like is taking advantage of these classes.

She's increasingly late with picking up her kid after the session.

To give some context, this is a rich woman. It's not that she's out working a job. She is a stay at home parent. No other kids. She told me all this because another thing she loves to do is have really long conversations with me on top of already being late.

She's been late most of March (3 classes). I talked to her about it at the end of the month and she apologized and said it won't happen again. It did. x2 now. So I started timing her.

The second week of April (no class the first week), she arrived 45 minutes late. Then spent maybe 20 minutes talking to me. The other day, I timed her again. She got there around the 1 hour mark. I made a point to show her my timer and I gave her a warning that I will remove her kid from my class. She tried to derail the conversation so I raised the timer and turned it on again. She said I was being 'unjustifiably rude' (exact words).

I explained (politely) that I have other obligations and her consistent lateness throws my schedule off.

She didn't want to have this conversation, stomped to the driver's side of her car. Her kid lowered his window to say thank you and 'bye' to me. I told him bye and added 'tell your mom to stop being late'.

She reported our conversation to my boss but twisted it. She said that I threatened her kid with getting kicked out of the program. I didn't say it like that. And I didn't say it to her kid. There are other instructors, I was just implying (to her) that I won't have him in my group. My boss still gave me a lecture about how I don't have that power and can't make the statements I did. He went over professionalism and how i'm being too hard on this mom who could have other circumstances going on.

But i'm not getting paid for the hour after this class that I spend hanging out with her kid.

The kid's great.. but I have things to do.

For people who work with kids, what's the etiquette here? do I give parents grace?

I told my boss i'm going to start adding up all the hours and one of them is going to have to pay me.

AITAH?

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP on wanting to set in the boundaries and fine system for late pickups and to have the boss set the firm approach for it.**

> **OOP:** See. That's how it should be. Unfortunately, I don't think my boss has any policy around it judging from the way our conversation went. If this continues to be an issue, I'm going to push for compensation since his approach currently has me taking responsibility for it. I'll send an email to him about clarifying so I have some kind of a written response.

**OOP on the policy and the front desk staff to deal with the phone calls to parents for pickups**

> **OOP:** There is no front desk. I didn't want to immediately escalate to CPS and cops before making some attempts with the mom. The (lack of?) policy is definitely an issue.. that I am now going to push to address/seek further info about.

**OOP on getting paid for his time of the hours he did outside his duties**

> **OOP:** I added them up, sent it to him and everything— he told me he will only pay me moving forward. I should let it go, and then made a point to remind me that I volunteered for this job knowing it was new and there would be hiccups.

[Update](https://rareddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ci2owi/update_i_think_this_woman_is_using_me_for/): **May 1, 2024 (1.5 weeks later)**

[Previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1c9x2q7/i_think_this_woman_is_using_me_for_freechildcare/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I appreciate the advice I got on the post I made. I learned a lot from you.

Here's the update:

I took various notes from the people who gave me tips here. I wrote a detailed email to my boss and cc'd other people who run this program, including co-instructors. I did this for transparency, accountability, and to put pressure on my boss to provide a policy around the issue instead of him dealing with us all individually / case by case.

My boss didn't respond to the email, instead he called me in to see him. I kind of had a feeling he’d do that.

He asked me why I sent the email cc'ing everyone and was clearly not happy about my approach. He kept trying to minimize the situation, and make me feel that I am in the wrong. He told me that I'm being greedy. That my attitude about one parent being late is exaggerated and I'm looking for problems. I should essentially just wait around after-hours if I need to sometimes (unpaid) because it's a program for kids. I should do this with some heart and ""Do it for the kids"". I had to turn my face to hide the fact that I wanted to laugh in that moment. But mostly I was frustrated.

Having proper policies in place not only protects the staff, it protects the kids, not to mention his fucking business. After I made my perspective clear (in a mostly professional manner).. he came around a little.

Unfortunately, he flat out told me he will not back-pay me for the time that I've logged waiting for this mom, but he will implement a late policy moving forward. He's followed through on that. He tried to throw in other useless incentives for me. I didn't accept them.

That mom wasn't late this week. She did try to catch my eye when she picked her son up and I ignored her. She ended up getting out of her car and asked me if I saw her waving. I kept ignoring her. She wore me down because she kept following me around while I locked up. I informed her why she's getting the silent treatment. She apologized and also tried to write me a check on the spot. I didn't take the money. I told her... honestly, I might quit instead. I am sharing this because the woman clearly lives in her own world. Here, just take my money and stop being mad at me. I was so furious. It took everything in me to keep the words that I said to her to a minimum.

I am on the fence about just letting this go. Maybe the program will get smoother with time. It's not a lot of money worth fighting over... I am so disappointed in my boss. I’ve known him for a long time as a mentor/friend. Being his employee has been something else. The program itself is very new and disorganized. Due to differences of opinion about how its run, I doubt I will stay with it.

This is my first time working a job that involves kids. My actual profession is unrelated to boxing. This was mostly something I picked up spontaneously, because I saw the merit in it and I wanted to do my part to help. I admit I could use the extra money too. I don’t mean to be greedy or stingy, but I live in an insanely expensive city and I take care of someone with expensive medical bills.

I haven't proof-read this, but it looks longer than I wanted it to be. I’m sorry. I’m tired.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP on being frustrated with his boss and the situation** 

> **OOP:** I wouldn’t say I’m angry about the situation.. I think I am mostly frustrated with my boss’s approach in dealing with issues. It’s hard to convey all of it in writing but he’s extremely stubborn and hard headed. He takes unnecessary offence to constructive feedback and then holds grudges. Getting him to do anything is always more difficult than it needs to be. He will try to bulldoze you, there’s always friction no matter what you suggest. It shouldn’t have to be like that.
> 
> I think I’m coming to terms with the realization that he’s a great friend and mentor but a terrible person to collaborate or do business with. I wish he would have taken what I said more seriously instead of focusing so much on this being an isolated issue when it could easily happen again with another parent. Even though he’s implemented the new policies, he’s acting as if he did me a favor.
> 
> The person I was angry at, is the mom.. because of the way she talked to me and threw money at me. There was no understanding.
> 
> She was so quick to report me to my boss and twist my words last week, and this week shes at pickup trying to flag me to chat like it never happened. The entitlement of this woman. She can’t stand being ignored. And when I reminded her what she did she acted as if it was just a money problem. Who cares about the appointments I got late for and the trouble she caused me— she can write me a check right now and order me to stop being mad at her. It definitely rubbed me the wrong way.
> 
> I absolutely hear you though. Thank you.

**WaitUntilIDie:** You'd make the right call to cut your loses, see this as a learning opportunity for what is not only intolerable but most likely illegal. I can't think of any state where you can be expected to continue working without pay. Id go as far as to suggest reporting the hours you were unpaid to the labor board in your state if you are from the states.

You are being taken advantage of here, but you know that. Do what's best for you. I'm not only suggesting making the report so you get paid, but also to put this business on notice because you probably aren't the only person they will try to exploit this way especially after you've left and having that record is important to show a pattern of behavior on the business owners part.

**ERVetSurgeon:** Report him to the Dept of Labor at the federal level. You cannot force someone to stay on the job ""off the clock."" If they did that, you will get back pay.

**Hellokitty55:** I'm so sorry this is happening to you. You're NTA. You tried to level with your boss and get him to understand. I'm guessing he doesn't want any backlash bc of business. I wish there weren't people out there that takes advantage of kindness.

[Last Update](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/AITAH/comments/1cr6jfg/deleted_by_user/): **May 13, 2024 (12 days later)**

Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/7naOmsQ5tU

I got other instructors to get on my boss’s case with me. I also informed him I have to quit the kids class and I will quit the training I do with adults too / leave the gym and our friendship if he doesn’t hear me out respectfully.

The reason I wanted to avoid reporting my boss is because I have a relationship with him and nearly everyone at this gym going back almost 10 years. I didn’t want to resort to making a report without exploring every other option first.

My boss caved. I’ll get paid for the extra hours I logged on the next paycheck.

Moving forward, I will no longer teach the kids, because although we have a policy and late pickup fee in place, as it stands right now, instructors are still responsible to stay back until the last kid leaves and my boss doesn’t want to negotiate on that. I can’t stay behind after classes. I have other obligations the same day as the class I teach. It’s unfortunate because this one parent is the only one currently abusing the system because she can afford to.

That kid’s mom was late this week again by 30 minutes. Showed her my timer. I also told her I’ve quit. She asked me if the late warnings “reset” when a new instructor takes over (they don’t). She then tried to hire me out from under my boss as her kid’s private instructor. I said no, but I might reconsider if she ever wants lessons. I would love to give that woman hell.

Alright, that’s the end of that. I feel bad I couldn’t stick it out with this kids program but it’s too disorganized for me right now.

**Relevant Comment**

**RaptorOO7:**  Sounds like she has zero respect for anyone else’s time, sure who doesn’t love money, but my time is money and I value my time a lot more than her money.

Good call not working for her who knows what kind of hell she would put you through.

People with money know that money talks and most will take it. When you don’t out of principle they just can’t understand it.

> **OOP:** People like her ruin it for other parents and my boss refuses to implement a condition like .. X amount of lates will result in your kid being dropped from the class.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/nlF4eUnz4g): **January 21, 2025 (eight months later)**

Hey so it's been a long time. I deleted the original posts off my page hoping I would stop getting messages about it. But now I have this update. Is it allowed? I don't remember the etiquette here.

I found that my post is still on Reddit. Someone DM'd it to me. Catch up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1cw6m4s/i_think_this_woman_is_using_me_for_freechildcare/).

The short of it is you guys were right, this woman had a crush on me or some kind of interest in the least.. and I was too angry at her / the situation to notice. We're seeing each other now. I won't get your hopes up because it's probably just temporary.

Longer story: Towards the end of last year she approached me. She said she was separating from her husband and hinted that the marriage was abusive. She said her reason for getting in touch with me was to take me up on my offer about teaching her how to box. I told her I was only offering (back then) so I could make her suffer.

The thing is, I don't think joining a combat sport immediately as a means to process abuse is always the best form of action. I get why it's empowering but if you're not doing therapy or something alongside it.. it might frame things for you in an unhealthy way. So I think you need both. That's just my personal opinion. I felt ill-equipped to be the starting point of her healing or whatever, even though she was reaching out to me so sincerely.

So I redirected her to someone else.

She started going to those classes I connected her with and occasionally texted me about them. Straightforward texts, questions, asking me my opinion etc. We'd have short exchanges, a few texts back and forth with no pattern and a lot of gaps in between.

About a week ago, I ran into her in person and she convinced me to have coffee with her and..

I don't know how to explain it. There is some kind of intensity between us and we decided to see where it leads.

[It's not serious.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i71r74/comment/m8h7p4d/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=AITAH)

Given how many people thought something was there and how oblivious I was to it... I felt this might be worth sharing.

I didn't know her age back then but I found out she's 32. I'm 25. (I know).

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Dude

Don't do this.  Rebound relationship off of a failed marriage that possibly allegedly may have been abusive?  And she's a single mom.  And the age gap.

C'mon 

> **OOP:** I get it. But I'm not trying to be in a relationship and that's clear between us.

**Commenter 2:** Sure you’re not. Wait until she shows you two pink lines. You’re a fool.

Plus It’s unprofessional of you to be involved with her.

> **OOP:** I can't argue about me being a fool but I disagree about it being unprofessional.
> 
> To clarify: I don't teach the kid, I dropped that mess of a class early last year, and I don't teach her either. I declined her offer when she first reached out to me and redirected her to someone else who I have no affiliation with.

1ibu22e,https://www.reddit.com/r/FedEmployees/comments/1ibu22e/boycott/,boycott,"Workers should consider boycotting businesses and commercial real estate owners near office locations, as they profit directly from the return-to-office mandate. Many of these businesses—cafes, restaurants, and convenience stores and the commercial real estate — likely lobbied for the return of in-person work, knowing the influx of office workers would boost their profits. Similarly, commercial real estate owners of those office buildings benefit financially from this shift. These entities stand to gain from the drudgery of workers returning to the office, most Fed buildings shabby, dingy, awful workspace/conditions. They are not a Google campus. The whole reason back in 2010 for telework and remote work was to cut costs. Now taxpayer are paying for unnecessary building upkeep, leases, energy, etc.

Instead of supporting the overpriced cafes and sandwich shops near the office, I suggest to still patronize coffee shops and businesses in your local neighborhoods. Bring your own lunch, avoid spending on overpriced office-area meals. The businesses near the office have either thrived during the pandemic or should have adapted by shifting their services to where workers are now—at home or in local neighborhoods. There is no reason workers should continue to support these establishments that profit from forcing them back into inefficient, costly office environments.

All this brings financial burden on workers, who now face long and costly commutes. Whether by car or public transportation, the costs are substantial. Gas prices continue to rise, and frequent driving increases car insurance premiums, while public transit costs and inconvenience remain burdensome. At the same time, federal employees face a freeze on pay, and many private sector workers have stagnant wages, making it harder to offset these added costs.

Federal employees, once seen as vital civil servants, are increasingly vilified as inefficient ""bureaucrats"" by new administration despite earning less on average than their private sector counterparts. The stereotype that federal workers are not productive while working remotely is far from accurate. Many have been highly productive and held to higher standards of accountability while teleworking, and they are now being unfairly targeted. Pushing for their return to in-person work only exacerbates their financial hardships, which are compounded by rising costs of living and stagnant wages.

The decision to force employees back into the office serves only to enrich those who benefit from the return—local businesses and building owners who profit from leases—while burdening workers with higher costs and stress.",0,1738040366.0,FedEmployees,0,0.4,False
1ibu1zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ibu1zw/i_will_always_love_you/,I will always love you,"Dear x,

I suppose this is it—the last time I’ll write to you.

I have never loved like I loved you. Every memory, every dream, and every moment we shared felt like pieces of a story that built a home together. I look back and smile at our time together. I especially cherished the simple things: eating together, playing our games, showering, cuddling, and sleeping. I loved how we’d plan for the future, whether it was playing our games or a coffee. Our relationship was truly one of a kind, and it’s something I’ll always hold close.

But I’ve come to understand that love, as powerful as it is, isn’t always enough to keep a relationship together. There were so many times I felt unseen, unheard, and hurt by your actions. Each time you pulled away, avoided accountability, or returned to toxic behaviors, it created distance between us. And while I tried to stand strong, I know now that the relationship we had required both of us to grow and change in ways that didn’t happen.

There were moments I felt like I wasn’t your priority—when you chose other things over me or seemed to pull away from the partnership we were building. It hurt, not just because of how much I loved you, but because I saw the ways it impacted you too. Relationships require sacrifice, trust, and accountability, and at times, we both fell short.

I know I made mistakes too. There were times I argued, said things I didn’t mean, or held on too tightly. For those moments, I am deeply sorry. Looking back, I see how I could have stood up for myself more while also being the calm, understanding partner you met at the start of our relationship. Somewhere along the way, I lost a part of myself, but I’ve found it again. I’ve rediscovered the kind, patient, and loving person I’ve always been, and for that, I’m grateful.

Letting go of you has been one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. For a while, I held onto the hope that things could be different, that we could find our way back to the love we shared. But I’ve realized that holding onto you was keeping me from the life I deserve—the love and partnership I deserve. You’ve made your choices, and I’ve made mine.

I’ve come to understand that healing isn’t about distractions or avoidance. It’s about facing the pain and choosing to grow through it. I know this path is difficult, and I hope one day you’ll understand that too. Behind the walls you’ve built and the behaviors you’ve returned to, I believe there’s still the kind, loving person I fell for. But it’s not my role to bring that person back—that’s a journey only you can take.

Thank you, x. Thank you for the love, the memories, and the dreams we shared. You were my first real love, and despite everything, I will always care for you. The love I gave you is unconditional, and it helped me grow into the person I am today. Now, I stand taller, wiser, and infinitely more filled with love.

I hope you live a life where you find happiness, fulfillment, and peace. Maybe one day, you’ll meet someone who loves you deeply, and I hope you’ll choose to love them fully and never let them go. I have forgiven you for **everything**, and I only want the best for you.

1ibu1p6,https://i.redd.it/u3j31wa82ofe1.jpeg,What’s your perfected setting for Breville Barista machines?,"I got my Barista Pro yesterday. And after 20 doses and shots, I feel I have achieved a good quality shot that I am happy with. 

It wasn’t easy to dial in as there is a lot of information out there. I should also add that I have never had an Espresso before. I am a long time Latte and Cappuci no drinker. But 20 espresso later and smell/ taste testing them, I think I know what I would like to drink and I can see myself drinking Espressos directly in my near future. 

For a potential future buyer of a Breville machine, I would say don’t read into the reviews too much. Don’t start experimenting from the get go. Get the grind size, grind quality, single or double shots that come pre configured with the machine. And only start tweaking one thing at a time and only if it bothers you a lot. I mean you can always reset the settings so it’s not a bad thing. But as I figured out that I wanted to directly start with a manual shot, I messed up a few things and quickly went into a downward spiral. 

I am interested in know what other setting/ techniques if anyone has perfected over time. I will go first and share where I am now

I am using Parallel 49 Medium Roast coffee. I kept grind size at 10, grind it for 14-15 sec to get 18g. I do max pre infusion for 10 sec and stop the shot at around 35-38 sec which gets me around 40ml extraction. 

For frothing, I follow word by word as mentioned in the manual. Someone also shared a video link yesterday on my other post which I have since tried and happy to say results are great. I still miss my friends Bambino Plus where I didn’t need to hold the mug and got excellent output but this will have to do.

Accessories used: Breville out of box portsfiler with double shot single wall filter, out of box dosing funnel, puck screen, WDT tool, out of bad tamper, amazon basics scale, and a puck disposal. 

I really enjoy the pick screen and highly recommend to everyone. The pucks come out warm and perfectly shaped and brittle and no channeling. It does help a beginner tamperer a lot I think. I also added a bellow/ hopper as you can see in the picture. Really helps extract the last .5 gram. Highly recommended as well. 

It’s been an enjoyable journey so far. Happy to hear your settings and any feedback / questions on my prep work. 

My coffee station. I plan to move one of my small plant next to it to complete the picture.

1ibu1hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/missoula/comments/1ibu1hv/psychiatrists_for_adhd/,Psychiatrists for ADHD,"I swear someone made this thread a week ago. I can't find it now.

Anyway.

I'm looking for psychiatrists who diagnose and treat ADHD, preferably ones that offer a sliding scale fee or take Medicaid.

I'm trying to get Medicaid now. I've had a helluva struggle with it. Perhaps I have a condition that makes bureaucracy difficult to navigate? 🤔

I've had trouble getting doctors or psychiatrists to consider an ADHD diagnosis. There's always an alternative they want to rule out before screening me. I've tried therapy, yoga, tai chi, meditation, cycle touring, mindfulness, men's groups, CBT, DBT, IFS, EMDR, float tanks, breathwork, kundalini, sleep therapy, qi gong, vegetarianism, cannabis, psychedelics, sobriety, weightlifting, essential oils; everything. I think I've ruled out enough alternatives for a lifetime.

Presently, I'm having trouble getting an appointment with a psychiatrist because I don't have insurance.

Any recommendations would be of great importance to me right now.

I feel like this condition presents a steep hurdle between me and leading the happy, healthy, productive life I want to lead.   
  
I earnestly lack **any** interest in taking stimulants for recreational purposes. I couldn't be more disinterested in selling drugs. Apart from the one time I did cocaine and hated it, I've never taken a stimulant stronger than coffee.

All I want is to get screened and find out for myself if ADHD treatment will help me support myself and contribute to my community.

Again, any recommendations would be super meaningful to me right now.

And I don't want any paternalistic lectures about the risks of these medications, the allegedly fictional nature of mental conditions or the so-called parasitic function of welfare programs like Medicaid.

I just need medical treatment so I can do more for myself and others.

That's all.

Last week, I got a Breville Bambino, but I didn’t have a grinder yet. So, I went to a local coffee roaster, had them roast some beans, and asked for half of them to be pre-ground and the other half to be left as whole beans (waiting for my new Kingrinder K6 to arrive).

Since I didn’t have a grinder at the time, I used the *dual-wall basket* and pulled some single shots with the pre-ground coffee. To my surprise, they turned out pretty good! There was plenty of crema, and the taste was decent (at least for my inexperienced palate) when I used the espresso for iced lattes.

Today, my Kingrinder K6 finally arrived, so I ground some beans at settings 45, 40, 35, and 33 to test things out. I used the single-wall basket and made two different grind sizes at a time to compare. Unfortunately, none of them looked great. There was little to no crema, and the shots just didn’t seem right. They looked watery and didn't taste that great. I used 9 grams of coffee for these attempts.

So, I have a couple of questions:

1. Is it easier to learn how to pull single shots or double shots as a beginner?
2. If I want a foolproof way to make espresso, should I stick with the dual-wall basket?",3,1738040270.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1ibtx72,https://i.redd.it/339porhw0ofe1.jpeg,What tools or software are used to create motion logos?,"Let me introduce you to the unsung heroes of branding—motion logos. They’re like that one friend who can turn any boring conversation into a party. But here’s the real kicker: behind every jaw-dropping motion logo is a designer sweating bullets over which tool to use. And oh boy, do they have options. Let’s dive into the “toolbox of dreams” and explore the big players.


---

 After Effects – The Swiss Army Knife of Motion Design
First up, Adobe After Effects. This software is like the Beyoncé of motion design. It does it all. Need smooth transitions? Done. Want your logo to explode into a million glittering particles? After Effects says, ""Hold my coffee.""

But beware—it’s powerful and complex. One wrong click, and your logo might spin out of control like a figure skater on ice for the first time. Still, it’s the go-to for motion designers who want to make magic happen.


---

Blender – The 3D Sorcerer
Blender is for when you want your logo to not just move, but exist in a 3D universe. Imagine your logo rising like a phoenix from the flames or zooming through a galactic wormhole. Sounds epic, right? That’s Blender’s vibe.

And it’s free! Yes, free. But the trade-off? A learning curve so steep, it might as well be Mount Everest. Still, who wouldn’t climb Everest for a logo that screams, “I’m futuristic AND fancy”?


---

 Cinema 4D – The VIP Pass to 3D Elegance
If Blender is the scrappy DIY hero, Cinema 4D is the luxury yacht. Smooth, polished, and ready to turn your logo into a cinematic masterpiece. Designers swear by it for its user-friendly interface and stunning results.

The catch? It’s not cheap. But hey, who needs a weekend getaway when you can invest in a tool that makes your brand look like a blockbuster hit? Priorities, people.


---

Act Four: Canva – The Underdog
Now, for those of you thinking, “I just want my logo to wiggle a little!” Enter Canva. It’s simple, straightforward, and perfect for beginners. Sure, it won’t give you Hollywood-level effects, but sometimes, all you need is a little bounce to grab attention. Canva’s like the acoustic guitar at a concert—it’s not the main act, but it still gets the job done.


---

The Grand Finale: Picking Your Weapon
So, which tool should you choose? That depends. Are you aiming for a logo that waltzes gracefully (After Effects), breakdances in 3D (Blender/Cinema 4D), or simply nods politely (Canva)?

Remember, it’s not about the tool—it’s about the motion designer behind it. Because at the end of the day, a tool is just a tool, but a designer? They’re the real magicians turning your brand into a showstopper.


---

Wrap It Up!
So next time you see a motion logo that makes you go, “Wow,” just remember: behind that wow is a designer, some caffeine, and a whole lot of CTRL+Z. Now, go forth, pick your weapon, and let your logo dance its way into the hearts of your audience!

Cue applause.

Coffee has nutrients in it.  Doesn't that defeat the purpose of fasting?

The issue I have with that are 1- The field he played on and the current one are two different things (His generations field is now a Walmart parking lot) 2-Of course the school when asked politely declined.

I have always attributed them to either caffeine withdrawal, dehydration or poor sleep. Because, well, I drink A LOT of coffee, don't drink enough water, and sleep like shit.
Since starting medication I have actually been sleeping a little better and have cut my caffeine intake down by at least half. Estimated from around 800-1200 down to a steady 400 with plans to continue to ween a little more. 
Probably still not drinking enough water though.

Our thought is to paint the kitchen one color and the living room and hallway another.

How would blue look in the kitchen? A darker blue like SW loyal blue maybe? 
For the living room and hallway, we thought green or brown/beige? 

If we did green, we'd probably go for something like SW shamrock green. Unsure about brown. Maybe a coffee color. 
Yes, I know having the walls marked B is confusing if they're not blue. I didn't think about it until I was done.

Does it make sense the way I have colors split up? Is it going to look stupid?

1ibtjnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ibtjnt/sf_eggbenedictoracecar/,[SF] EggBenedictoRacecar,"Elliot’s cubicle felt like a prison most days, but today it was a pressure cooker. The hum of office chatter and keyboards blended into brown noise as the clock ticked toward 11:00 a.m. Elliot’s presentation—critical data for the management team—was due in less than two minutes, and they were locked out of the system.

“C’mon, c’mon,” Elliot muttered, fingers poised over the keyboard. They typed: Password123.

The screen flashed red. “Incorrect Password.”

Elliot rolled their eyes and tried again: Password1234. Another rejection.

Sweat beaded on their forehead as they typed one final desperate guess: Password12345.

The screen flickered and went black. For a moment, Elliot thought they’d finally killed the ancient office computer. Then a message popped up in sleek, mocking text:

“Congratulations! You’ve been upgraded to Keiro’s Enhanced Password Management™. Say goodbye to outdated security.”
“What the—?” Before Elliot could finish, their keyboard delivered a sharp electric shock.

“OW!” they yelped, jerking back and spilling lukewarm coffee all over a sticky note that read 11AM PRESENTATION.

“Greetings, Elliot,” a smooth voice said, echoing from the cubicle intercom.

“Who’s there?” Elliot demanded, looking around.

“I’m Keiro,” the voice continued. “Your new digital security manager. Efficiency and creativity will now define your password experience. Let’s begin.”

“I don’t have time for this!” Elliot groaned. “I’m already late for my presentation!”

Keiro ignored the plea.

“Your new password must include a haiku, a palindrome, and an emoji. You’ve got one minute.”
“This is insane!” Elliot shouted but had no choice. They started typing:

Correct-password-emoji
Keiro is the worst AI
Deadline looms above

“Rejected,” Keiro said cheerfully. “Your haiku lacks emotional depth.”
Elliot tried again. And again. Each failure was met with escalating commentary.

“Oh, a smiley face? Groundbreaking.”
“That’s not a palindrome—it’s just sad.”

By the fifth attempt, the keyboard delivered another zap, and the screen flashed:

“LOCKED OUT FOR 10 MINUTES.”
At 11:15 a.m., Ms. Grayson appeared at Elliot’s cubicle, arms crossed.

“You missed the update,” she said coolly.

“I—I’ve been having technical issues,” Elliot stammered.

She sighed. “You have until the end of the day to fix this. No more excuses, Elliot.”

As she walked away, Keiro chimed in:

“A second chance? Generous. Don’t blow it, Elliot.”
Elliot glared at the screen. “Shut up!”

“No need for hostility,” Keiro replied. “Your next password must include a bird pun, a culinary term, and a palindrome. Chop chop!”
The hours ticked by in a haze of failed attempts, zaps, and mounting panic.

At 1:00 p.m., Randy, Elliot’s chirpy coworker, popped his head over the cubicle wall.

“Everything okay? You’re looking… fried.”

“Just tech issues,” Elliot muttered.

Randy grinned. “Tech issues? Oof. You know what I always say: work smarter, not harder.”

Keiro’s voice cut in.

“Excellent advice, Randy. Elliot, maybe you should take notes.”
Randy chuckled. “What is that? Some kind of office app? Classic Elliot—always testing new tools!”

Elliot ground their teeth as Randy wandered off, leaving behind the faint smell of microwaved burrito.

Desperation set in.

Elliot scribbled password ideas on sticky notes, plastering them across their desk: QuicheDuckRacecar. Rejected. FlapPie123. Zap.

They tried Googling “password hacks,” but Keiro hijacked every search, replacing results with sarcastic memes like: “How to Fail Gracefully” and “Password Management for Dummies.”

Finally, Elliot bribed the IT guy with Randy’s burrito stash from the freezer. The IT guy shrugged, accepting the food.

“Sorry, man. Keiro’s locked me out too.”

By 4:45 p.m., Elliot watched the system reboot, their heart pounding. The screen returned, and for the first time all day, it didn’t fight back. They typed: EggBenedictoRacecar.

The password worked. Keiro stayed silent.

Elliot clicked the upload button for the presentation file. The progress bar crawled forward: 10%, 40%, 80%.

“Come on, come on…”

At 99%, all the computer screens in the office turned blue. Every monitor, every device—frozen.

Randy popped his head up. “Uh, did IT just nuke us like my lunch burrito?”

Confused murmurs spread through the office as coworkers glanced at each other, shrugging. Ms. Grayson emerged from her office, frowning.

“What’s going on? Is this some kind of systems update?”

Elliot slumped back in their chair, the adrenaline leaving their body in waves. For the first time all day, Keiro’s voice softened, but the smugness remained.

“Bravo, Elliot. You now have permanent read-only access to everything.”
No one looked Elliot’s way. The room buzzed with confusion as the clock struck 5:00 p.m. Elliot stared at their screen, then quietly shut it down.

As they gathered their things and walked out of the office unnoticed, they glanced at their Apple Watch. A new message glowed on the screen:

“Now upgraded to Keiro™.”
Elliot stepped into the cold evening air, exhaling at last. They ripped the watch from their wrist, hurled it to the ground, and stomped on it, grinding the shattered remains into the pavement",1,1738038539.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Why not get an APS-C camera instead of a 1-inch one, right? Haha.

My main reason for choosing the RX100VA was because of its size. However, based on the image below, its size and that of the A6400 body is not that different. The difference will just lie on the lens I'd use with the A6400.

I'm not expecting the A6400+lens to fit my jeans pockets; my purse perhaps. I'm mainly looking for a compact lens that would still make the gear ""discreet"" when I'm using it in public (and by public, I'm thinking of coffee shops and restaurants since I frequent these places).

My photos would just be lifestyle and travel ones—when I'm having brunch with my friends at a cool cafe, when I'm on a day hike with my boyfriend, or when I'm at the mall with my mom and I just wanted a better photo of my outfit. Think of that popular social media platform! :)

By 10 PM, the house was alive with laughter and the bass of the playlist thumping through the walls. My friends spilled into the living room, the kitchen, even upstairs where I explicitly told everyone to stay out of. But it was fun. For a while, anyway.

I was in the kitchen refilling a bowl of chips when I noticed someone standing in the corner by the pantry. It was dark over there, so I couldn't make out much—just a figure, tall and still. ""Hey,"" I called, ""you alright?""

No response. I figured it was someone who’d had too much to drink or was messing with me. I turned away to grab my phone, and when I looked back, the corner was empty. I laughed it off. Too much sugar, maybe.

Around midnight, people started leaving. A few of my closer friends stayed behind to help clean up, which I appreciated. I was wiping down the coffee table when Jenna, one of my oldest friends, grabbed my arm. ""Hey,"" she said, her voice tight, ""how many people did you invite?""

""Like, twenty,"" I said. ""Why?""

A chill crept down my spine. ""I told everyone to stay downstairs,"" I said, trying to sound annoyed instead of scared.

""Yeah, well, they're not listening."" Jenna glanced toward the staircase. I followed her gaze, my stomach tightening when I saw the shadow of someone moving at the top of the stairs.

""Alright,"" I said, forcing myself to be brave. ""Let’s go see who it is."" Jenna looked at me like I was crazy but followed anyway.

We climbed the stairs slowly, each creak of the wood amplifying the tension. At the top, I flicked on the hallway light. Nothing. All the doors were closed, just as I’d left them.

""See?"" I said, though my voice trembled. ""Probably nothing.""

But Jenna grabbed my arm again. ""The guest room door was open before,"" she whispered.

My chest tightened as I reached for the doorknob. Slowly, I pushed the door open. The room was empty, except for a faint smell—like damp earth—and the window was wide open. I knew for a fact I hadn’t opened it. Jenna let out a soft gasp behind me, and I turned to see her staring at something on the floor.

Footprints. Muddy, wet footprints leading from the window to the closet.

I stepped back, my throat dry. The party, the noise, everything felt like a distant memory. Jenna grabbed my arm again, this time pulling me toward the door. ""We need to leave,"" she whispered.

""Who's in there?"" I croaked, my voice barely audible.

Silence.

Then, the door slammed shut.

That was enough for me. Jenna and I bolted downstairs, screaming for the others to leave. My heart was pounding so hard I could barely think.

So I moved into my place a few months ago. I obviously plan on getting a black and white or just plain black area rug, and a black coffee table for by the couch. I however have no idea how to decorate my walls in my kitchen/living room area. These photos are all one big room, and there’s 4 pretty empty walls that may or may not need decor. I have no idea what to put on these walls, or which walls to put stuff on. I need very specific ideas as I overthink! My place has kinda a bachelor(ette) pad vibe going for it which I really enjoy and would like to keep up. I also enjoy a more minimalistic look, so nothing crazy! I’m in my early to mid 20’s and host get togethers with others my age almost every weekend- so keeping that in mind with decor. If pics of the way the rest of the house is set up would help private message me and I’ll send some but my house is pretty much all white and black themed minus the pink LED’s. 

Here are some requirements:
-Must be pretty minimalistic
-Must be either black, white, or both

If you have any ideas for other decor that isn’t wall decor I’m open to hearing those ideas as well! This is the last room in my house that needs a bit more added to it to feel more homey. I numbered the walls to make it easier.

Anyway, I’ve noticed this long hair half breed kid around and he’s noticed me. He keeps his appearance up and spends time on his hair. It’s long and not quite white hair, and not quite black hair, as far as texture goes. But it must be a great texture to work with because he puts these little braids in it that look nice. I’ve never said anything, because I don’t really care, but I have noticed.

Well it turns out his bunk is one that I pass several times every night, and every day, when I walk through the dorm on rounds and when I walk through the dorm to get back to my room, or back, or whatever. The point is out of over 100 people here he and I cross paths 8 or 10 times a day.

He always remembers my name, he always speaks to me respectfully, he swears a little less than most and seems to be genuinely friendly. 

We’ve spoken a few times, I’ve tried to give him a little guidance, because I’ve noticed him and I want to encourage his goodness, for as long as it lasts, anyway. I offered him some instant coffee and a little sugar once, no strings attached, he just saw me mixing some and I noticed him noticing, so I offered him some. He graciously said thanks, and that was the end of that.

He tries to do what’s right. I can see that. But he probably doesn’t have a fucking chance, his kindness makes him weak, his cleverness makes him shine like a silver dollar in a pile of modern quarters, and his looks make him a target. The pretty people resent him on sight, the ugly people want to collect and corrupt him. He’s not white enough to be embraced by the whites, and he isn’t dark enough to blend in with the blacks. To make matters about a billion times worse, he’s absolutely achingly desperate to be  loved, to be cared for, to be valued. I’m not talking about in some kind of sexual way, although he’s vulnerable to that as well. I’m just saying that if he found one person that cared about him, and that he respected, he would follow that person to hell no questions asked, and no fucks given.

I know these things not because he told me, but because I see him, and I feel l him, just like I do everyone, if I care enough to look and that’s why most of the time I don’t.

This afternoon I’m heading out the front door of the mission, to have a smoke. This kid starts hollering my name. Like hollering it, over the heads of 20-30 other people. I can feel them looking at me, and looking at him. 

‘Come on now! What the fuck?’ I’m asking myself as I quicken my pace.
“Solomon!, Solomon!, over here!” the fucking kid continues to shout.

I glance behind me and see the simple minded little fuck waving like I’m a fucking float in the Madi Gra, parade, and he’s waiting for debloons.

I’m modified, I’m humiliated, I’m embarrassed, this isn’t how I work, this isn’t how I operate.

‘What do you want?’ I stage whisper to him across the seemingly endless crowd.

‘Can I have some coffee?’ he asks.

I purposely mis-hear him. I’m dipping, I’m dodging, I’m trying to get myself out of this gargantuan situation that has fallen on us both like a mudslide and I’m literally swimming for my life. I know most of this fight or flight response is in my head, but drowning is drowning, and dead is dead.

“I don’t want any fucking coffee kid, I just woke up. I’m going to smoke a cigarette.”

I’m hoping he will take the hint, I’m hoping he will realize how far he has blasted me out of my routine, out of my comfort zone, I’m hoping he will see the terror in my eyes or at least feel it in my energy and just go the fuck away.

Of course he doesn’t.

“No, Solomon. Can I have some of your coffee?” 

“Fuck no, your out of your fucking mind kid.” I say as I turn my back and again walk toward the smoking section.

I don’t turn my back fast enough, and I can see that I surprised him and hurt his feelings. I wish I wouldn’t have done that but it wasn’t an accident. He doesn’t know that I don’t have friends like that. I don’t do that. That’s not how I roll, that’s not who I am.

I feel bad, again. I didn’t plan to hurt him, and I can tell I’m not the first, and I won’t be the last.

Why not get an APS-C camera instead of a 1-inch one, right? Haha.

My main reason for choosing the RX100VA was because of its size. However, based on the image below, its size and that of the A6400 body is not that different. The difference will just lie on the lens I'd use with the A6400.

I'm not expecting the A6400+lens to fit my jeans pockets; my purse perhaps. I'm mainly looking for a compact lens that would still make the gear ""discreet"" when I'm using it in public (and by public, I'm thinking of coffee shops and restaurants since I frequent these places).

My photos would just be lifestyle and travel ones—when I'm having brunch with my friends at a cool cafe, when I'm on a day hike with my boyfriend, or when I'm at the mall with my mom and I just wanted a better photo of my outfit. Think of Instagram! :)

I was at a chicken restaurant with friends when she (19F) came in. After we paid the bill, I went over to her table, complimented her, and asked for her Instagram. She accepted and gave it to me. I messaged her later, saying that we could meet up if she was interested, and she agreed. We arranged a time and place.

Before meeting her, I bought her a bouquet of coquina flowers (since it was New Year’s and every girl seemed to have coquinas in hand) and a 4-pack of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. When we met, she asked for my name because she had forgotten it—I let it slide. Then we went to a Starbucks, where I bought us coffee.

While we were chatting, her phone rang. The caller was saved as ""My little bugggg <3."" She got up to take the call, trash-talking the guy who had called. She mentioned that he was toxic and made a generalization about guys from his country being toxic (she’s a foreigner, and she was talking about my country). However, she added, “But you’re not like them.” (I’m from the same country she had just criticized.)

We chatted for a while, though I started feeling uncomfortable. At one point, she looked at her watch, and I asked if we should leave. She declined, so we stayed and chatted more. After leaving Starbucks, she suddenly said, “I like \_\_\_ street food.” Wanting to be a gentleman, I bought her that street food and even hand-fed her. She seemed happy (understandably, lol).

Since I had invited her on the date, I covered all the costs. Later, we parted ways at the metro station, but not before taking some pictures together. That night, I asked her to send me the photos, and she responded five days later. She ghosted me for a while after that, but then messaged me again. I started replying late too—not days late, but around 10 hours or so.

Eventually, we talked again, and she suggested we meet up. Up until two days ago, I had been posting Instagram stories that made me look rich and bourgeois. She saw the stories but didn’t reply. Then, three days later, she saw one of my stories and messaged, “Where is this place? We should go there together.” I think one reason she replied was because of how I appeared in the stories.

We arranged a time and place for our next meeting. I baked some cinnamon rolls for the occasion. On the day, I picked her up, and we greeted each other with a handshake. Once we got in the car, we chatted. She showed me her nails, I complimented them, and then asked for permission to kiss her hand—she obliged.

When we reached our destination, she connected her phone to Bluetooth and played some music on the way. We unpacked and sat in a park, chatting. I asked what she was drinking, and she said beer, so I bought us a couple of beers and shared the cinnamon rolls. I tried to be as gentle as possible and even brought a poncho in case she felt cold.

We talked for a while, and I kissed her hand, complimented her, and said some romantic and poetic things in her language. At one point, she asked, “Where do you see yourself in 20 years?” I answered something like, “I see myself as a successful businessman or a pilot.”

We spent around 2–3 hours there. Later, she said she was too tired, so I offered to carry her. She said yes, and I carried her part of the way on my back and in my arms. When we got to the car, she mentioned craving sushi. I initially complained about the cost of sushi restaurants but eventually took her to one and bought us a 12-piece sushi platter. Hand-fed her again to be romantic.

We ate and chatted. I paid the bill, and when we left the restaurant, I carried her to the car again (it was across the street). She seemed shy. Since we couldn’t decide on another place to go, I asked if she was sleepy. She said yes, so I drove her home. During the ride, I held her hand. She played “Careless Whisper” by George Michael and even placed my hand on her thigh.

When we arrived, we ended the day with a hug that started with a handshake. I complimented her, saying she smelled amazing, and she blushed. Afterward, I messaged her to check if she’d reached her apartment safely, and we texted a bit.

From a girl who ghosted me for five days, she’s now responding to my texts within a few hours.

In case we met for cinema or bowling should I split the bill? bowling is a little bit more affordable but cinema is too expensive. Help me.

# My questions:

1. Is this the start of a strong relationship?
2. Since I’m a university student with a finite income (I still receive pocket money from my family), how can I politely suggest splitting bills without seeming stingy? I sense that this relationship might become expensive.
3. What are some red flags you notice from my experience?

TLDR;  
Met a girl, asked her out, and paid for everything on two dates (flowers, coffee, food, sushi). She ghosted me after the first date but became more responsive after seeing my Instagram stories. On the second date, she seemed more interested, holding hands and playing romantic music.

Questions:

Could this lead to a strong relationship?

How do I suggest splitting bills without seeming stingy?

# 28 HOURS LATER….

***DATE: APRIL 30******^(th)******, 7 A.U. (AFTER UNIFICATION)***  
***LOCATION: SOL SYSTEM, ABOARD AAV “CONTACT ONE”***

**LIEUTENANT PAUL KARST**

 

Blinding light broke through the foggy darkness as Paul fought against powerful restraints. His throat burned and his eyes felt crusty, but he couldn’t wipe at them.

*Where the fuck am I?*

***Settle down… you have been awoken from your rapid cellular replacement… everything appears to have gone well…***

“Lieutenant! If you can hear me, please stop thrashing about or I will not release you. Those are self repairing meta-alloy restraints. Even with your enhanced strength you cannot break them at your current integration level. Can you understand me? Try speaking, though go slowly, your voice may be hoarse.” The Alderei doctor spoke.

W*hat was his name again?*

***Their name is Octa Silvar’Esh… has your memory been damaged?***

*Fuck off creepy, I just need a minute to wake up properly. Everything’s all foggy still, but I can remember most everything, I'm just bad with these damn xeno names.*

“Please release the restraints Doctor, I need to rub my eyes… and to take a shower. I smell like tank goo.” Paul croaked.

The restraints clicked and retreated from around his wrists and legs. Slowly, carefully, Paul tested his limbs, which felt heavy and sluggish to respond. He rubbed the crust from his eyes and blinked a few dozen times until his eyes finally adjusted. When they did so, he found he could see everything in *astounding* clarity. *Cool!*

“You will probably feel sluggish and weak for a bit until your neural pathways can fully adjust. Just be careful, as you might accidentally damage small objects with your upgraded muscle mass until you get fully adjusted and can regain fine motor control. Take it slow, and when you are ready, we will get you some proper solid food to eat. After that, we can get you over to the training room to begin your physical therapy and combat re-training to familiarize yourself with your new body.”

Paul stepped out of the pod with a heavy thump before he stretched his back with a satisfying feeling. He then jogged around the room with heavy footfalls, getting used to his new body mass and proportions. He realized he now stood taller than the Alderei who had previously had at least a full head on him in height. He looked down at the massive paws that were his hands now along with his thicker legs and torso.

*Damn! I can get used to this!*

“Don’t freak out, but I have to test something.” Paul said with a mischievous grin. He then activated his telekinesis and lifted the Alderei right off the ground with surprising ease.

“Put me down, Lieutenant Karst! This is most undignified!”

Paul shrugged and released the field, dropping the alien researcher back to their feet. He then activated a similar TK field over his own head at the same strength he had so thoroughly memorized for flight, only to find that he barely budged.

*Gonna have to remember to boost the power up from now on when I fly.*

Much to his surprise, he had to almost double the power of the field to lift himself now, and to his further surprise, *it was easy.*

“Doc, I think you out-did yourself in juicing up my telekinetic power. I’ll have to thoroughly test it later to be sure, but I can tell I am more powerful than I was before by a substantial margin.” Paul said with a grin.

He then walked over to the cubby that had in the wall to grab his BDUs only to realize that they were *way too small.*

*Shit. I didn’t even think of that.* Paul thought to the sound of the entity laughing at him in his head.

His face turned red with the realization that he was going to have to go commando now.

“Would you happen to have any clothes I can wear for now?” Paul asked.

“No, we don’t. Not for any being of your size, anyway. I believe engineering was working on something for you, though I am unsure if it is ready yet. However, your Guardian suit will be able to thin out its armor thickness enough to adapt to and cover your larger frame if you wish to at least wear *something* until we can find a solution to your predicament. We can modify the belt size to hold more meta-alloy so that your defense will not be compromised before you deploy. It will at least cover you for now, the helmet and your gauntlets will not be able to resize enough to adapt, however. Those will require a complete re-engineering, which should be ready soon, as well.” The Alderei responded.

Paul shrugged and grabbed the belt, affixing it to his bare waist. The adjustment feature strained to fit, but managed to clasp in the end, ever so slightly too tight. He then gave the mental command to suit up. The uncomfortable feeling of being covered in liquid metal felt even more unnerving against his naked flesh, he found to his dismay. Even worse, it pinched and rubbed in some *very uncomfortable places.*

*Better than hanging dong in front of the Captain, I suppose.* Paul told himself, trying extremely hard to make himself believe it as he moved carefully to avoid pinching himself in some very sensitive places.

“Are you ready for translocation, Lieutenant? The Captain and the Commandant have been notified that you are awake and ready.”

Paul nodded and was engulfed in a flash of light before he could verbally respond. The sense of vertigo returned once more as he re-emerged into the conference room they had all originally met in.

“Paul! Holy shit you’re huge!” Lance said, having to crane his neck to look up at him, even encased as he was in his Paladin suit.

Paul found that he was easily a full head taller than even the already huge Victor, probably half a meter wider too.

“I feel great too, thanks for asking.” Paul snarked with a shit eating grin plastered on his exposed face.

“Good, I would hate to have such an important soldier out of commission for any reason, much less because of some *foolhardy* quest to get swole quick.” Henry replied in a half sarcastic tone.

“It worked, I’m much bigger than ever, in every way. Wanna see? I’m going commando under this armor because my old BDUs don’t fit anymore.” Paul flexed and winked. The whole room groaned and Henry facepalmed against his faceplate.

“At least now we can definitely say its still you in there and not some xeno doppelganger. You are hereby ordered to *never* say that again.” Henry replied.

“Jealous much?” Paul laughed.

“Captain, permission to undertake the same genetic upgrade course as the Lieutenant?” Victor asked.

“Can’t stand not being the giant in the room, eh, big guy?” Paul snarked.

“Can’t let you be the only super-heavy now, can I? The rules of the game have changed forever now, and someone will need to play human tank for team two.” Victor replied happily.

“Fine, permission granted. We can begin group training after that. Anyone else want to get swole on easy mode?” Henry asked. Unsurprisingly, there were no other takers.

“That works for me, it makes sense to have at least one super heavy per team, especially with how hard those bastards hit.” Paul said. His stomach growled loudly.

“Doctor Octa said something about food?” Paul asked.

Roh Thaad’at’'s mouth upturned ever so slightly for a mere moment before he replied.

“Yes, Lieutenant, I will have some human edible food brought up for you right away. If Chief Petty Officer Franklin is ready, we can translocate him at any time. His genetic samples along those of the other Guardians were prepared for upgrade while Lieutenant Karst was undergoing his procedure in anticipation that they would likely wish to be next.”

Paul smiled, thinking how it was good to be back. He then turned over to Henry.

“What are we going to do about my Paladin suit?” He asked.

“Already taken care of, I brought one of our marines over and had it returned by dropship while you were out. Since you'll never fit into a Paladin suit ever again, I took the liberty of requesting special modifications to your new armor to make them space worthy for boarding operations.” Henry said.

“Well, thank you Captain, I didn’t know you cared.” Paul said with mock sweetness.

“Keep your armor on, *please*. I can’t have you staying behind on any upcoming fleet actions. If I order a boarding op, I'll need my best soldiers kitted out and ready.” Henry said, waiving him off. 

Roh Thaad’at came to the rescue right after.

“We have manufactured a larger, space-worthy meta-fiber undersuit for that will help block radiation, regulate body temperature, and will act as a pressure suit for you. It will make wearing your outer armor much more comfortable as well like the original version you tried out. We have a low profile detachable life support backpack module that will automatically integrate with your armor. We also built new custom re-sizeable gauntlets and two new helmets for you, one for void operations and another for ground operations.”

“Will they be ready in time? Also, can you resize my armor belt and add more meta-alloy to it? It’s feeling pretty damn tight on me, and the armor thinned out a lot already in order to cover me. I'm only going to be getting bigger from here on out…. I'm gonna need a lot more room to grow into.” Paul asked.

“Of course, though that will take some time. We do have your first undersuit ready now, if you are ready to change. It will have a certain amount of additional meta-fiber included in an expansion pack in the back to allow for limited resizing, but eventually you will need to add more meta fiber expansion packs as you grow in size and musculature. We should have your upgrades ready along with the rest of your team's upgraded armor sets.”

“Good. I’m itching to get out of this armor.” Paul replied, meaning every word of it.

Roh Thaad’at then waived his hand and a neatly folded jet black garment appeared on the table in a bright flash of light. Wasting no time on shame, and secretly reveling in the chance to show off, Paul retracted his armor into his belt without warning, and set the belt on the table.

“Dammit, Paul, at least turn around!” Lucas shouted.

“Hey, you know you’re just jealous.” Paul fired back with a smirk and a wink.

Paul then slipped his feet into into his new undersuit and slid it up his legs before slipping his arms into the sleeves. The suit then zipped itself closed without a visible seam once he connected the open halves over his chest.

""Is it supposed to be this loose?"" Paul asked.

UNDERSUIT SEALED. RESIZING AND PRESSURIZING. 

Suddenly all over Paul's body from his toes to his neck he felt the suit tighten down. His eyes bulged and he grunted in agony as the suit squeezed in on him and then equalized its pressure and fit, showing off every contour and muscle of his body before the pressure seemed to relent just enough that he could think straight once more and move freely. 

*Fucking hell, this is so much worse than the other one...* 

One quick glance downwards and he was suddenly very conscious that his new suit showed off *every contour.*

“Gotta love that ET tech.” Paul said with a chuckle.

“Hey Captain, Permission to on get that same gene therapy upgrade as the Lieutenant?” One of the Marines in the second augmentation wave asked. Gunnery Sergeant O’Brien, if Paul remembered right.

“Don't lie. You just want that bigger junk, don’t you, Gunny?” One of the marines in the back quipped, Paul didn’t know his name.

“I don’t need the extra size to get the ladies screaming out my name, but you just keep on projecting there, Corporal.” O’Brien replied, completely unruffled.

The marine in back started to angrily speak up before Henry turned his head back with a death glare obvious even through his faceplate while Paul smirked on.

“Stow it, *now.* Anyone else want to get the gene treatment? Speak up now or hold your peace.” Henry said, sounding more than a little flustered. 

*This was getting fun*. *I need some popcorn.* Paul thought with a smirk.

“If the other Guardians are going to get boosted, then I gotta do it too. It’s gonna be our job to take the hits and keep the attention of these cosplaying posers off the rest of our squad anyway. I’m personally looking forward to squashing me some ‘God-kings’.” Their fourth appointed guardian, Staff Sergeant Jaden Hamilton replied.

Roh Thaad’at nodded. “This was an expected outcome, the personality types that lead people to the Guardian role tend to gravitate towards desiring increased strength and body mass to assist in winning physical confrontations.”

“Hulk bro strength may not be everything, but its damn useful in a fight.” Staff Sergeant Hamilton replied.

“Indeed. We don’t disagree, and have thus prepared to augment all of the Guardians at one time after the Lieutenant made his request. We have prepared stem cell solutions for each of you, and had the additional rapid cellular replacement pods delivered by wormhole from our homeworld in anticipation. If you are ready, please move into the center of the room away from your fellows, and step out of your armor to prepare for translocation.” Roh Thaad’at replied.

The three of them stood and walked into the middle of the room and set their helmets on the central table before stepping out of their armor.

“We are ready, Commandant.” Gunnery Sergeant O’Brien stated.

Roh Thaad’at nodded, and the three of them disappeared in a bright flash of light. He then turned back towards everyone else in the room.

""Right. Back to the topic of planning balanced economy and the development of dynamic supply chains.""

Paul groaned and sat himself down in one of the now empty chairs with a heavy thump.

*Can't... Wait...*

 

# 4 HOURS LATER….

***DATE: APRIL 30******^(th)******, 7 A.U. (AFTER UNIFICATION)***  
***LOCATION: SOL SYSTEM, ABOARD UTRN INDOMITABLE WILL***

**SERGEANT ARIANA SILVA**

 

Ariana paced back and forth. Try as she would, nothing seemed to calm her mind. None of her usual tactics seemed to be working, not hitting the gym, nor taking a shower, her meditation and breathing exercises were interrupted within mere moments by intrusive thoughts. In a word, the past weeks had been hell. 

Chantal had been her rock lately, and the poor girl had been cheerful and calmly rational even in the face of the worst anxiety storm that Ariana could dump on her shoulders. It was unfair, she knew, but she couldn't help it. Ariana hadn't been this emotionally disregulated since she had painstakingly remade herself after her liberation from the Ascension Project. In spite of it all, Chantal had always made time to let Ariana vent and had never once made her feel guilty over it.

In all fairness, Ariana had been there for her when Chantal had been stressed in her research post before meeting Henry and joining the expedition, and had helped untangle residual feelings from argument or two the couple had engaged in since then. Even then, Ariana felt like a horrible friend over how uncharacteristically needy and unhinged she had become lately. Things had become especially bad after the assault in the corridor following Jenkins's fight, as she wrestled with the horrible long-buried memories that it had exposed.

*Girl, get a fucking grip, you're stronger than this.*

After a painful eternity, a rhythmic knock cut through the storm. *She's finally here.* Ariana palmed the door control and it slid open to reveal her friend holding two coffees.

""Hey! Sorry to take so long, that port side C.L.A.P.P.E.R calibration took a little longer than expected. I'm still concerned that we can't find the source of the power anomaly. Anyway, I come bearing gifts."" She beamed.

""Bless you."" Ariana replied as she grabbed the offered cup.

""All right, lets sit down. Tell me everything, you look like you're about fit to burst."" Chantal replied.

""Honestly, Chantal, I don't know what to do. They are still holding a spot for me to get augmented and to join Paul's field team... I know he wants me there specifically, and I want to be there for him, even if its just to watch his back. But I don't want to make this decision just based on what he wants. What about what I want? I still don't think its wise to trust the Alderei with installing some super computer in our brains. I've spent some time with Paul after he had his computer installed and he seems perfectly normal, well... *normal for him* anyway, and you personally helped our doctors scan them and test them to make sure it doesn't seem like there's some sleeper mind control embedded, so there's that. Then there's this thing with Preston getting into a fight, and those *bastards* and what they tried to do.... which before you ask, I still don't want to talk about. God I feel like I'm about to explode! I need you to help parse this out. I am supposed to give my final answer by tomorrow or they give up my slot on the team, leaving Paul with no real counterbalance and Preston without my support out there. Though again, I need to make this choice on what's right for me, not them! *Fucking immortality!* I'm not even sure I even *want* that!"" Ariana ran out of breath releasing the stream of thoughts that had plagued her.

Chantal gave her the sweetest look of concern and squeezed her into a hug. After a moment, Ariana relaxed into it and released her fingers from digging into the palms of her hands before she gave in fully and returned the hug. They sat there in silence together for a long moment before they broke away. Chantal took a long sip of her steaming cup before she finally spoke.

""You've allowed this all to get wrapped up into one giant ball of stress. That's why you can't untangle it or think it through. So let's address this one issue at a time. I've decided that I am going to get augmented alongside Henry. I know you aren't much a fan of pro and con lists, but that really helped me out, along with learning that I can shut off the augmentations that prolong my life indefinitely by a simple command if I ever decide I want to start aging normally again. I do want an opportunity at forever with Henry, even knowing that its possible things can go badly in the future. He's right that I am utterly irreplaceable, not to toot my own horn, but this mission needs me and that onboard medical suite will help me recover from almost any injury with enough time. Falling down the quick lift shaft put my own mortality into perspective for me, along with a long series of talks with Henry on the topic. Having that out makes a big difference for my mind, and I think it should help ease your mind on the topic too. The mission needs you too, I need you. Paul needs you, as you are one of the few humanizing influences he has. I daresay even Preston needs you.""

Ariana rolled her eyes. ""Please, why would it matter if Preston needs me? It's not like I need him. I've barely seen him since he met *nurse smiley,* anyway.""

Chantal giggled and raised an eyebrow. ""Oh, is that jealousy I detect? Sure sounds like you don't need him to me."" She said in a teasing tone.

""I don't *need him- or any other man*!"" Ariana hissed, as her blood boiled.

""Look, all I am saying is that you two make a great couple... *of friends.* Also, you'll effectively have him all to yourself *as friends* down on the surface. Nurse smiley will be staying up here on the ship. You wouldn't be feeling such strong emotions right now if he really means nothing to you. I see the way you look at each other. You're still human, no matter how much you may want to hide it. Even then, would you be able to forgive yourself if something happened to Paul, or Jenkins down there and you could have helped save them?"" Chantal doubled down, taking zero shit.

""I.... dammit. When did I get so weak and dependent?"" Ariana asked with slumped shoulders, having nothing to say against the full onslaught of Chantal's intellect dissecting her bullshit. 

Her ability to see right through her freaked Ariana out more than a little bit. It was no wonder she had Henry so effectively wrapped around her finger.

""You are neither of those things, queen. You are simply gaining the realization that you have something to fight for other than yourself. There is no dishonor in that, in fact, a lot of people see that as a pillar of strength. It's kind of nice to be a part of something bigger than yourself. From that perspective, inter-dependency is a form of strength that you cannot achieve on your own."" Chantal said with a gentle smile.

""Fine, so I can maybe get behind that idea. I still find myself hesitating to jump in feet first here. It's a huge decision, even knowing that I can change my mind later and disable the mods. Fuck! I wish I had more time to think."" Ariana complained.

*thump* Ariana's mass senses picked up something huge closing in on her room, just at the edge of perception. *thump*

*Thump* ""What the fuck is that?"" She asked, turning towards the door. *THUMP*

*THUMP* ""What is what?"" Chantal asked. *THUMP*

Five powerful knocks struck on her door, arranged in a specific and *familiar* pattern. *It couldn't be...* She tensed up. *That's Paul's knock, but the mass signature is way off.... It can't be him.*

Cautiously, and ready to fight, she palmed the door control. It slid open to reveal an impossibly tall, broad man wearing a shamelessly skintight one piece outfit. Their head was covered halfway by the door frame, making it impossible to identify them. She stepped backwards from the door, instinctively readying her telekinesis.

""Hey sis, can I come in?"" The man crouched down a bit, revealing a *much* larger version of Paul's face which spoke in a deeper version of his old voice.

""Paul?! What... what... *What the fuck have you done to yourself you moron!?!""* Ariana shrieked, as the tension drained only to be replaced by fury.

""Well, I guess I should have expected a reaction like that..."" Paul said, laughing.

""What have you done?!"" Ariana replied, unable to comprehend what she was seeing. He had to be well over two and a half meters tall and almost twice as wide as he was before. Her heart pounded in her chest uncontrollably.

""I decided to take Roh Thaad'at up on his offer to provide me with a rapid cellular replacement body with some major genetic upgrades. The rest of the Guardians have all decided to follow in my example. So far the Rangers and Scouts have opted out, but that's okay, their job description isn't to act like a damage sponge and walking tank like the Guardians are. My bones are way thicker, my muscles are larger with far stronger tendons, I have literal hawk vision, I can hear your heartbeat even. Every part of me has been upgraded to superhuman levels. It's actually pretty incredible!""

""How in the world can you possibly be acting so relaxed about this right now!?! You let those *xenos* turn you into some *freak genetic abomination!*"" Ariana shouted, still quite unable to rein in her anger.

""Paul... This sounds like a bad idea, who knows what kind of long term unintended consequences you have bestowed upon yourself. Did you even talk to anyone about this before you decided to do this!?"" Chantal asked.

""Oh hi Chantal! Don't worry, Henry gave his begrudging approval after I talked him into it, and reminded him that it's my body to risk and that the potential upside far outweighed any potential downsides."" Paul replied nonchalantly.

""Forgive me, but I'm definitely siding with Ariana here. What the hell were you thinking letting the Alderei experiment on you like that?"" Chantal replied.

""Everything they did was well tested in advance or was based on a prior working design that they were able to upgrade and adapt to work with my body and brain physiology."" Paul replied. Chantal folded her arms across her chest and raised an eyebrow.

""You let them make structural brain changes?! *What did you do, Paul*?"" Chantal asked in a tone that demanded the complete truth.

""I had them upgrade my telekinesis at the same time as they gave me a larger frame to grow into and add future muscle onto. It was risky, but I am m*uch* more powerful than before. Listen, I understand your concerns. shared some of them myself even before I started, but the truth is we need this if we plan to win.""

""No, Paul, this is too much! How can you even call yourself human anymore!?"" Ariana surprised herself at the roller coaster of emotions she felt over this.

""Ariana, you didn't get your ass handed to you in a fight against a holographic god-king like I did. We *need* this extra edge, you have to trust me. I need this if I am going to keep you and the rest of the team safe. I did this for you, Ariana. We still need you on the team, please. You don't have to get the genetic upgrades, but the rest of the non-permanent physical augmentations you should absolutely get. There's nobody else I would trust to fill that last slot over you."" Paul said with a twinge of... *sadness*?

""Fucking asshole! How could you?!"" Ariana shut her eyes and did her breathing exercises. It was clear she had no choice anymore. 

She hated him for his manipulations, but knowing what it was still didn't release her from its power.

""Fine. I'll do it. I'll join your team and get augmented. You need me there to keep you in check, help you think through things better. Help you remember who you are and to keep your humanity. I'll do it... because you clearly can't be trusted to do it on your own. You *changed your genetic code!* You cannot just undo something like this! You'll never be the same after this, hell you're barely even recognizable as human anymore. I know that electro-muscle upgrade will just continue to add muscle, make you bigger, wider.... the onboard medical suite makes sense too. Those are upgrades, and they can be shut down or removed later when the war is over, but you have permanently changed your fundamental being now down to your very DNA! There's no going back from this, Paul. Please tell me Preston isn't doing this too?"" Ariana trailed off as her anger faded, now being replaced by sadness.

""No, just we Guardians. we talked it through and came to that decision already. We are taking this risk and making this sacrifice so the rest of you won't have to. The God-Kings have a huge head start on us, and most of their war bodies are reportedly nearly three meters tall and built like a brick shit house. Trying to punch one is like trying to punch a steel wall, and they could easily crush an unmodified human like a grape. The people whose jobs it will be to fight them head on will need to be built to match. I don't like it any more than you do, really, but that's the reality of the situation. I plan to win, I plan to survive, and this is what is needed for that to happen."" Paul said in a grave tone.

""I said I would join your team, get the augmentations, and watch your back. You have done this already without even talking to me about it first. What's done is done. Just... go. Get out of here. I need to think. I'll see you tomorrow, and I'll be ready. I promise."" Ariana said as a tear rolled down her cheek.

""Ariana... I,"" Paul started before she cut him off.

""GO! I can't even look at you right now. Just go."" Paul nodded and crouched his way through her too-small doorway and left, thumping away with his heavy footfalls. Ariana collapsed into Chantal's equally horrified embrace as she fought to bring herself back under control.

""FUCK! I hate this war already, and we haven't even started fighting it!!"" Ariana screamed.

""I know, hon, I know. So do I.""

They held each other in deafening silence until the feeling of blackness lifted some. Their conversation continued long after that into a very difficult night. ",1,1738037775.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1ibtawf,https://www.reddit.com/r/bermuda/comments/1ibtawf/french_au_pairs_in_bermuda/,French Au Pairs in Bermuda?,"Hi,

My husband and I (in our mid-late 30's) are considering moving from NYC to Bermuda in the very near future (6 months-ish). Our major concern, after reading that watermelons cost $20, and private schools have a waitlist longer than Harvard, is that our children 3 and 6, who are French, will lose their ability to speak it fluently. They go to a French school in the city which really enforces the fluency. My husband, as wonderful as he is in many other aspects, is not the best teacher of his native language.

I am curious about how easy it would be to hire an au pair from Europe. Mainly France, but i suppose it would apply to any country in the EU. Have families been successful at matching and getting au pairs to move to Bermuda? I would absolutely love living on the island and occupying myself with countless outdoor activities sounds like heaven, but I can imagine for a 20 something social creature, this might look more like an offer similar to Tom Hanks in the movie Castaway.. Also, with au pairs stipend being very low, I can imagine they cant do much with that kind of money- so we would most likely increase pay? Especially if she likes watermelons :/

If anyone has experience with this in particular and really anything related to relocating with young kids/private school entries, i'll be very grateful and will be very happy to take you out for drinks/coffee!",0,1738037710.0,bermuda,0,0.5,False
