It involves carefully considering flow, zoning, and furniture placement to create an environment that is practical, comfortable, and aesthetically pleasing. A well-planned space allows for seamless movement, avoids clutter, and optimizes every inch for its intended purpose.

For instance, in a compact living room, multifunctional furniture—such as a coffee table with hidden storage or a sleek sectional sofa—maximizes usability without overwhelming the space. Zoning helps define specific areas, like a cozy reading corner or a dedicated workspace, without disrupting the overall design harmony.

The key is to strike a balance between openness and utility, avoiding overcrowding while maintaining proportion. By ensuring that every element is in its ideal position, space planning transforms interiors into well-structured, inviting spaces that effortlessly blend comfort with style.",1,1742818503.0,designscienceinterior,0,1.0,False

hey du fam,

i’m a first-year currently trapped in a pg with NO window, NO balcony, NO soul.just four walls closing in on me. i cannot do this anymore. at this point, i don’t even feel human. i need sunlight, fresh air, and a space that doesn’t feel like a storage unit.

so, i’m looking for a flat (or a shared flat, but my own room) in vijay nagar because i deserve to live like a person, not a cave-dweller.

✨ must-haves:

ac, fridge, kitchen, wifi (just basic survival needs, not asking for a palace)

a window or balcony (non-negotiable, i need light like a plant before i photosynthesize into sadness)

a landlord who’s not a dictator and is cool with my boyfriend visiting & staying over for a day or two


since third-years are moving out, i know some good spots will open up. if you’ve lived in a flat here before, tell me how it was! and if you or someone you know is looking for a flatmate, hit me up.

help a girl move into a real home, and i’ll forever owe you (or at least buy you chai/coffee).

So in this year. I’ve had twitching everywhere/ clonus jerks/ trembling hand /Legs. Tight throat / excessive saliva . Hand/Arm/Leg weakness/Pain. Trouble swallowing and more.
Slight atrophy of FDI. Hand numbing and locking up at night.

I’ve had multiple EMGs/ bloodwork/ vascular and seeming a rheumatologist with no findings yet.

I don’t know my fate yet but I decided to say fuck it. I have two young kids at home and a family so I decided to make changes and move on with life. Last summer was the hardest summer of my life . I could barely walk / neck pain barely lift my head, but I pushed through. I thought I would be 6 ft under by now. 

I have no idea what’s going on with all of us but I know all our symptoms are very real and none of us can get answers. So I took matters into my own hands to look for any improvements. 

First I got on cymbalta which I was very reluctant to do.

2nd I started drinking a vitamin power “nuzest” and mushroom coffee. This is supposed to have a bunch of mushrooms to help with nerve issues. 

3rd water and stayed busy.

4 sleep hygiene went from sleeping 2 hours a night to 8 (anxiety)

Like I said by no means 100 percent but I went from 5 to 60. DONT GIVE UP! I know how hard it is with all these crazy symptoms but try to find stuff to keep your mind right. I’m not saying to stop searching for answers do your due diligence but don’t let it consume you. I tried to be a doctor when I wasn’t getting answers forming my own opinions. (Easier said than done). Many of my symptoms have come and gone I’m praying the slowly keep improving. I’m here if anyone has questions. Stay strong !",4,1742818235.0,ALSorNOT,0,1.0,False

1jip340,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jip340,Starting using the lid,"I ordered a few lids for the ember mugs in the house and have now been using it for a couple of weeks. Here are my thoughts.

Tldr: 100% worth it. Must have accessory.

The good:
The lid provides an incredibly secure fit that is leak proof for normal use. The hole at the top (where you drink from) is covered with a slider though not completely sealed as turning it upside down would still allow liquid to come out. It isn't a put in your backpack type thing... It's more of a oh crap I knocked over my cup on my desk type of thing. However, it is much more secure of a lid than I ever experienced for a cup/mug. The ember mugs in generally are difficult to accidentally knock over due to their bottom heavy weight, but this adds even more security to that aspect.

The lid comes with 3 tabs that are fairly easily removed, cleaned, and swapped out. The ones you receive are red, white and black... with the black one coming preinstalled. From underneath you squeeze the tabs inward and the tab cover falls right off. About the tab itself, there is something very satisfying in the way it slides back and forth. There is a slight detent that makes the motion intentful and oddly satisfying. Incredible design for something so seemingly small of a detail. Above the tab there is a small air replacement hole that seems to do a well enough job even with full sips.

Along the outside there is a larger rim area to use for taking the lid off across from the drink hole (the top?). This will definitely be the only way of getting the lid off as the rest of the rim sits flush with the mug rim in a way that seems like it was a part of the mug all along. Again, wonderful design. The topside of the lid that faces the ceiling is again thoughtfully designed with a curved slope that makes you wonder why other companies haven't thought of this. The comfortability of drinking from this is second to none.

A bonus feature of the lid is also how much battery life is added as the mug doesn't have to try as hard to keep your drink hot. I'm not sure of exact numbers as I haven't sat there to measure, but at least 30% longer battery life doesn't seem too unrealistic from my casual observations. Am I making it to 120 minute goal? Probably not quite, but I have strategically placed coasters in areas where I spend my time so this is a problem I've chosen to addressed in a different way.

The improvements for a 2 generation lid:
In a way the stellar aspects of the lid also lead to some issues that could arise. For instance, the incredibly tight seal of the lid although preferred can be rather hard to remove from the mug. Not so much an issue if empty, but if somewhat full and you want to top up your drink there is some physical strength calculations you got to do to get the lid off. Not too strong of a try to jerk the mug and spill, but enough to get the lid off still. Hard to explain, but a real world issue nevertheless.

The plastic tabs are nice touches. I do wish they came with more colors or that ember sold a color pack of several. As much as I think it's too much to charge for single colors, I would settle at a compromise of perhaps 3 or 5 packs of colors. At the very least there should be a color matched to the mugs pack. Some time spent matching the plastic color to the sage green, the two different blues, and the gray, sandstone and lavender mugs is something definitely needed for this product. It's like buying a $1000 phone and being able to get the appropriate matching color official case from the same brand. The same could be said for having replacement coasters available for sale in the colors. I primarily use either a black or white mug so there was some research done probably to make those available, but the navy blue, sage green, etc should be available as well.

Now back to the lid. The gasket around the lid is white and blends in nicely. I think black would have been fine to use, but I think the frosted white makes for a better aesthetic with the lid especially if used on a white mug. However, over time is see this gasket/seal becoming coffee stained. Care needs to be taken regularly to wash this part especially to remove any coffee residue from having long term exposure. This may be less of an issue with tea though unclear.

The last issue and probably the hardest to solve is the material in general. A lot of people specifically purchased the ember mug because of non leeching materials. We don't use spoons in our mugs to keep the surface impermeable and safe. That is counteracted by having a plastic lid which I'm sure is strengthened with bp(x) type hardeners. Hot liquids through plastic is unwelcomed by many. A steel alternative even at a premium price could be a great alternative if offered. Same shape, same silicone gasket even. Doesn't have to have a tab. Preferably uncoated, but if color matching same material as the cup can be used I'd imagine that would hold up well still even with teeth possibly hitting it. That would really add a stellar look to the overall presentation of each mug.

An cursory observation that ends up being a negative is that the experience of drinking from this lid can be at times quite different from consuming a beverage lidless. There is absolutely no scent that reaches your nose when sipping from the lid. This unexpectedly drastically changes the flavor of your drink. I couldn't pinpoint what was happening the first week I used it and thought maybe the plastic was changing the flavor in a disturbing and undesirable way, but no. It turns out that smell is indeed a crucial part of flavor like we have been told. I just never experienced such a valid test of this before. Maybe this is an issue for you maybe not. I expect it to be noticeable for astute coffee and tea drinkers especially the ones that are dedicated enough to have purchased an ember mug in the first place... which is I suppose everyone reading this so...

--------------------------

And finally a suggestion. This isn't totally off base because the ember actually used to do this... and that is to include the lid with a mug purchase. The premium metal colors should definitely come with a lid included for the price, but the original non-handled cup bundled it before so I'm wondering what happened. Do they sell enough to have them only available separately. I would surmise that more people do not give themselves to experience the lid because it is an extra purchase. That fact lessens the appreciation and experience of overall ember mug ownership. I can't see any way that even if the additional revenue from only having the lid as a separate purchase makes up for that sacrifice as a company as tough as it may be to demonstrate on an Excel presentation.

And that last sentence sums up things pretty well. I definitely recommend getting the lid. I feel as though it is a required accessory for ember mug owners. And overall, the ember mug is definitely the best at what it does. Are there issues of various types that crop up? Sure. Are they compounded by the fact that you're spending over $100 on a cup and another $30 on a lid and perhaps another $30 on a coaster? Definitely. And that's the thing. Ember is mimicking another well known tech company in their approach, but have not acknowledged the intangibles that are left on the table that would allow the company to be more successful. The lid a good example. I look forward to continue to use the lids I have purchased and welcome perhaps a ember mug lid gen 2 in the future which I'd assuredly also purchase, but I hope at that time it comes in a bundle so I can spend more money on that. :)

I have an unmodded Gaggia Classic, 110v and made in Romania in 2017.  I've used it daily for several years, with only small, correctable problems here and there.  

Yesterday, I turned on the machine as usual, but when I went to make an cappuccino a half-hour later, the machine was cold.  I figured the thermal fuse had gone bad, and switched to steam to see whether the boiler would heat up.  It did, so I shut down the machine, grabbed a fuse from an older Classic (I've managed to pick up a couple for modification and parts), and switched it out.  Everything went well, it warmed up nicely, and I made my drink.

  
This morning, I turned on the machine, then came back after 30 minutes to make my cappuccino.  Once again, the whole thing is cold.  I don't know if something is causing the fuse to blow, or if there's a connection problem.  I have a multimeter, and while I'm not incredibly well-versed with every function, I hope that I know enough to run some diagnostic checks.

Packing up her desk felt like a funeral. Two decades of staplers, coffee-stained memos, and framed photos of her now-adult kids vanished into a cardboard box. But then, her fingers brushed an old photo album, forgotten in a drawer. Flipping it open, she saw snapshots of the parties she used to throw—luaus with paper leis, a backyard masquerade with glittering masks, a 1920s speakeasy complete with jazz records. Her best friend Carla’s voice echoed in her mind: *“You’re a natural planner, Evie. You should do this for real.”* Back then, she’d laughed it off, too busy with life.

Then the pandemic hit, and I've never been able to go back to how I was before. 

2025 has seen me trying to get back countless times, but I always go back to unrestrained eating. 

I've been thinking lately, and high calories foods are the bane of my existence. Where I work, there's always breakfast readily available with a very sugary black coffee, but all the foods are high in sugar and low in nutrition. So I decided to just skip breakfast and buy my own foods to eat them before work. This morning, I had granola with milk... Maybe not the greatest thing but it kept me full for a while. Maybe the problem is that I'm not eating enough in quantity?

I tried going to the gym but I did almost pass out thrice the same week, so I basically gave up. And my right foot has this weird pain that comes and goes, and it kind of prevents me from walking too far. I need to go back to the gym and take it easy so I don't pass out. 

Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's not easy at all to get into the right mindset to just stick to my diet plans and lose weight...",1,1742817081.0,loseit,4,0.67,False

But 4 years later, I'm not half as inspired to draw my boys as I was when it all started mid-pandemic. So, 13 issues later, after a semi-hard relaunch with a new art style, I've decided to finally put HxC to bed so to speak, and pivot to something more fantastical. Enter: BIG BLUE GLORY — a story about a gay comic book influrencer who turns into a handsome, 7 ft tall, nigh-invulnerable, blue-skinned monster whenever he climaxes. A Superman/Hulk hybrid who draws his incredible power from The Gape; a dimension from which all the sexual energy throughout existence derives. As you might imagine, these powers that he's yet to gain full control over get him into all sorts of hot water, and I can't wait to explore all my crazy sexy ideas within this character's story arc.

Instead of an ongoing series, I've decided to release ONE BOOK and document the entire creative process. You'll be able to witness me create BIG BLUE GLORY Volume 1 — a complete 100+ page graphic novel — and page by page, see me tweak the writing and images, while letting you guys know what my plans are for the story.

1jioru6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransLater/comments/1jioru6/taste_buds_changing/,Taste buds changing,"Hi everyone, I’ve been on HRT for over a month now and have noticed some weird effects that weren’t in the brochures. And I’m wondering if anyone else has noticed any of these changes, or if it might be psychosomatic, and I’m just happier so I reflect the world differently.

The first is my taste buds, I know some people have reported smelling being heightened on E, but I’ve been absolutely astounded that things I loved in the past now taste gross for instance I loved black coffee. I would sometimes drink 5 large cups a day, I haven’t changed anything with my coffee, but now it tastes so bitter and just isn’t enjoyable anymore.

On the flip side, things I’ve hated now either don’t taste that bad, or I’m actually finding I enjoy them. For instance I was the 1/1000 that absolutely hated chocolate, it always just tasted like dirt (I know weird) but I smelled some the other day and had an instant craving, I gave in and it wasn’t amazing, but I got some enjoyment from it. 

The second thing I’ve noticed changing is my eyes. I’m not sure how to explain it, but colors seem to pop more and things I never thought of as shiny have a shine to them now. For instance I have this black coat for boymoding, I always thought it was a matte finish, now it almost looks like it glows black. I guess the best way to explain it is as if contrast has been turned up 100%.

The second one I have told to some cis female coworkers who said they had similar experiences coming off bad birth control, so I feel this one might be a hormonal change. 

Any one else going on E notice anything like this, or have you noticed anything other not advertised effects?

Today I saw some texts between my gf and one of her colleagues. The chat was how she sends a meme which shows a horse and if someone sends this horse to you, you owe him a coffee and a pastry. From there it is straight flirting for 10 texts until she cuts it off and doesn’t answer. 

I decided to confront her in the most nonjudgmental and safe way and basically told her what I saw, and if she was in my place what would she think, is there something I should worry about. 

She immediately took out the guilty face and once I stated the obvious, she started apologising and giving reasons why she did it, about what is missing in the relationship and so on. After discussing it about 40 minutes I told her that I need some time to think and we separated.

One hour after that I receive a text from her apologising again and basically that all of the relationships go through such phases. And one hour after that another text saying how she went through the texts and isn’t worried anymore as the texts aren’t what it seems to be and she wants to meet to explain them to me.

She gave a pretty non-believable explanation but apart from that, why would she confess and apologise for something in the first place, if she can’t remember the chat or is unsure about what I am confronting her about? This is what’s bugging me.

Hello, diary. Today was a day that left me with more questions than answers—and a chill down my spine that I can’t shake. I woke up to the sun rising, its rays filtering through the treetops, painting the interior of the cabin with a soft, golden light. For a brief moment, I almost felt at peace, as if the forest were just a beautiful, wild place with no dark secrets. But then I remembered the twig dolls I’d found a few days ago and that constant feeling of being watched. I decided that today I would go deeper into the forest, try to understand what was going on. Maybe if I explored further, I would find a logical explanation for all of this.

After a quick breakfast—black coffee and a slice of stale bread—I grabbed my gear: compass, flashlight, my trusty Swiss Army knife, and the Polaroid, which I now carry with me at all times. I stepped out of the cabin with the fresh morning air filling my lungs, but there was a dampness in the air that clung to my skin, making me shiver. As I walked, I noticed something strange: the birds were silent. Normally, the forest is a symphony of songs and chirps, but today, there was nothing. Just the sound of my footsteps on the dry leaves and the wind whispering through the branches, as if the forest itself were holding its breath. After about an hour of walking, I reached a part of the forest I had not explored before. The trees here were older, their trunks thick and twisted, covered in dark green moss and pale lichens. The air seemed thicker, almost oppressive, and the smell of wet earth was stronger, mixed with something I could not identify—a slightly acrid odor, like rusted metal. That was when I saw them: more twig figurines, hanging from the trees like sinister ornaments. But this time, something was different. They were arranged in a straight line, as if marking an invisible path or trail.

Curious and a little apprehensive, I decided to follow the line of figures. Each one seemed more elaborate than the last, with details that gave me chills. Some had small black stones for eyes, which glowed strangely in the dim light. Others had markings carved into the wood—crooked symbols that looked like letters from a forgotten language. As I walked further, the forest seemed to close in around me, the branches intertwining above me like skeletal fingers, blocking out most of the sunlight. The silence was so profound that I could hear the blood pounding in my ears.

Finally, I came to a small clearing. In the center was a large stick figure, larger than the others, about three feet tall. It was surrounded by a circle of smooth stones, similar to the one I had found days ago, but this one was larger and more elaborate. Inside the circle, the ground was covered in dry leaves, but there was something strange: there were no insects, no animals, not even an ant. It was as if the life had been sucked out of it, leaving a disturbing void.

I approached the large doll, feeling a knot tighten in my stomach. When I examined it closely, I noticed that it had something tied around its neck: a torn piece of cloth, stained with something dark that looked like dried blood. My heart began to beat faster, and a horrible thought crossed my mind: who would do something like that? And why? Was this a prank by a local, or something more sinister?

I decided to take a picture with the Polaroid, as I had done before. I held the camera with shaking hands, framed the doll, and clicked. As I waited for the image to develop, a cold wind blew through the clearing, sending the leaves swirling around me. When I looked at the photo, I almost dropped the camera. In the image, the doll appeared to have moved—its head was now turned directly toward me, as if it were staring at me. But that was impossible; I hadn’t heard any sound, any movement. I looked back at the real doll, and it was in the same position as before. Or was it? For a second, it seemed as if its twig “arms” were spread wider, as if it were trying to reach me.

I shook my head, trying to dispel the irrational fear that was beginning to take hold of me. “It’s just a trick of the light,” I muttered to myself, but my voice sounded weak and unconvincing. The feeling of being watched was stronger than ever, as if invisible eyes were watching me from every side. I looked around the clearing, but saw nothing but the silent trees and the shadows that seemed to lengthen as the sun rose.

It was then that I heard it: a whisper, so low that I almost didn't notice it. It was as if the wind was carrying words, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. I concentrated, trying to understand, and then I heard clearly: ""Thomas..."". My name, whispered in a slow and sinister way, as if it came from very far away and at the same time very close. I turned in every direction, my heart racing, but there was no one. Panic began to take hold of me, and I shouted, ""Who's there?"" My voice echoed through the forest, but there was no response, only oppressive silence.

I decided it was time to head back to the cabin. I put the photo in my jacket pocket, along with the previous one, and started walking back, following my own footprints. But as I moved forward, I had the distinct feeling that something was following me. I looked back several times, but saw nothing—only the rustling of leaves and the movement of shadows. However, the whispers continued, now more insistent, as if several voices were speaking at the same time, murmuring words that I could not understand.

I arrived at the cabin panting, locked the door and sat at the table, trying to calm my rapid breathing. I took both photos and examined them again. At first, the circle of stones with the bones now seemed to have more bones than I remembered, arranged to form a pattern that hadn't been there before. In the second, the large puppet looked even more distorted, its stone ""eyes"" glowing sinisterly, almost as if they were alive.

I decided to write a report on what I found, but I hesitated. How do I explain this without sounding crazy? Who would believe in moving dolls in pictures or voices whispering my name in the forest? Maybe I should talk to someone in town, ask about local legends. I remembered that when I first arrived, the locals had mentioned something about a witch haunting the Burkittsville woods. At the time, I laughed at the idea, thinking it was just country superstition. But now... now I'm not so sure.

At night, as I tried to sleep, the whispers returned. This time, they seemed to come from inside the cabin, as if they were right next to me, muttering incomprehensible words. I closed my eyes tightly, covering my head with the blanket, but the voices persisted, creeping into my mind. At some point I must have fallen asleep, but I woke up in the middle of the night with a shock. There was a scratching at the door, slow and deliberate, as if something was trying to get in.

I picked up my rifle and stood still, listening intently. The scratching stopped after a few seconds, but then I heard footsteps moving away—heavy and slow, like something large was moving around the cabin. I ran to the window and looked outside, but the darkness was total, a black wall that swallowed any light. I couldn't see anything, but I felt a chill run down my spine, as if something evil was out there, waiting.

I went back to bed, but I couldn't sleep anymore that night. I lay there, rifle at my side, listening to every creak of the cabin, every whisper of the wind. Now, as I write this, the sun is rising again, painting the sky with shades of pink and orange. I'm exhausted, but determined to find out what's going on in this forest. Today, I'm going to the city, to talk to the residents, to try to understand the legends. Maybe there's a rational explanation for all this—hunters playing pranks, nocturnal animals, my own mind playing tricks. Or maybe... maybe I'm in real danger.

I only know one thing: I can't ignore what's happening. I need answers, and I'm going to get them, no matter the cost.

Anyway, the last time I saw him was on Thursday, and since then, there's been complete radio silence. I haven’t heard from him, nor have I reached out, as I’m not entirely sure how I feel about him.

Finally got a date after a really long while…So I had some questions. Its a girl I haven’t seen in a long time prob 6years or close to that. We had math together and went to the same school but I never really spoke to her idk why. Always found her very attractive and beautiful and found her profile recently and decided to message her…I asked her if she would like to go out for a coffee sometime…She didn’t answer directly only read it. 2 days later she answered with a voice message meanwhile I forgot about it because I thought she didn’t care…She said it was a bit unexpected. She also said she saw someone from our school and if I would like for us all to meet or If I would like for us to meet privately so I of course said that only the two of us should meet…I told her a date about a week later and she said she is working but we will meet an hour later after she is done and we will drink something downtown…

So my questions were…Apart from knowing her name and nationality and age I don’t really know anything else about her so what do I ask her how do I talk to her?

Also does she know its a date because I didn’t really tell her its a date just asked her to drink some coffee so does she think it’s a date or just a quick meet up?

I know girls don’t like it when guys are too open and say everything on the first date but what else should I talk to her about? After all I don’t know stuff about her…How do I know I am not oversharing?

And lets say the date goes well…Do I just wait for her to say she has to go or how do I end the date exactly?

And she still hasn’t accepted my friend request…maybe she hasn’t seen it?

And since she responded 2 days later I thought that she was questioning what to say…and asked me if I wanted to meet up with another one of our classmates or just the two of us to know If its a friendly meet up or a date…but my cousin who is 20 said girls don’t overthink so much and are not so complicated which is crazy because I know girls who do so is this accurate or rather not?

I am [33M] from Europe and my girlfriend is [36] from HCM, she comes from a tradition family but she is not as traditional as her family. She has a really good job and earns double than what I earn. We are in a relationship for over 5 months now, when we started dating I didn’t mind paying for everything but over time I noticed it was going into consecutive days that I was paying for absolutely everything, sometimes she would pay for coffee but not often this was happening for a period of time and while this was happening I remember my washing machine broke and I had to go to a laundry to wash my clothes she didn’t even offer to allow me to wash my clothes at her place and since I have been in a relationship with her she has never invited me to her place, there is times where she would go into a store with me and buy a drink or snack and wouldn’t ask me if I wanted anything or just get me one so it made me think about everything and I realised maybe it’s best to have a conversation with her about this so we did and she suggested we pay for ourselves when we are out so I agreed.

When we were out one day I took money from an atm and I was putting the cash into my wallet and she grabbed a 500k note from my hand and put it in her bag and she did it in a joking way, I just went alone with it expecting her to return it to me in a couple of minutes/hours, most of the day went by and she still didn’t return my money I asked her a couple of times for it but she brushed it off then later that night I had to go to the store to buy some things and I actually needed the money or I would have to go to the atm to withdraw money again which was an extra 15 minute walk or a grab bike away so I asked her again and she told me she will give it to me tomorrow and I realised she was serious and I asked her what does she mean and why, she told me she needed to make a credit card payment before a certain time and she used the cash to make the payment  (she was speaking about this credit card payment earlier that day but I didn’t think much of it) I told her she could of just asked me before she did that and not disguised it as a joke and I told her it was dishonest what she did and it’s really not ok to do that we had a huge argument, she told me she has cash in her apartment she will return it to me now and she said everything is about money with me, I said it’s not just about the money it’s that you weren’t honest about it and took my money and I asked her if she has money in her apartment why did she take my money and she told me she had 6 minute to make the payment of there would be fees of 6% on what she owes which was around 6 million, I asked her is she in debt and she said no with her salary it’s nothing and that she just panicked and used all the cash in her bag and got a woman in a store we were at to transfer the money to her account so she could make the payment and that she thinks of me as family and she didn’t think it was a problem, she returned me the money that night but my big issue is the dishonesty at that time. Nothing has happened like this since

She has told me in the past she would like to live in Europe but doesn’t talk about it much and she lived in Germany in the past for a short while(I’m not from Germany), she has made comments about marriage a couple of times and expressed she would like to get married but never expressed anything directly and it was only mentioned on two occasions.

We started to date in September 2024 and 3 weeks before that I've met her and talked to her in this 3 weeks then I've expressed my feelings.

When relationship has started, we both talked each other about our past relationships and the things we got hurt. She wanted respect and I wanted healthy communication. Luckily she gave me that. But at the same time I was looking a relationship that can evolve into marriage. I also expressed this too and she agreed but at the same time she didn't like the idea.

I was over the roof in the first two months but also I was questioning about ""did I do right about entering this relationship?"" but I sticked with the relationship and started to spend more time with her. I could believe that spending more time will make us more attached to each other and it did happen. Every time we spent time together make me more attached to her. But one thing gave me a doubt about relationship. 

She said she likes attention a lot. And when we meet her house at saturdays every week she said she is not happy with that and she wants to meet outside of the house I mean she was right but we were working at college as academics and we have different working schedules. But she was right about that and I started to change myself. 

After that we had an argument at phone and that argument changed everything. She was not that sensitive to me anymore, she can easily argue and she can get angry easily than before.

I know I am not the best boyfriend. I didn't give the attention she wanted but remembering small details about her or going to grab a coffee with her didn't make much after sometime. So as a anxious attacher, I started to see her 3 days a week but I was like this ""Are you available in wednesday?"" she said she doesn't like this either but I really don't know what I do because or schedules were different. I felt like trapped.

Weeks are passing and we somehow figured out how to argue but at the same time she was never the one who apologize first. She also said after that she is stubborn and she is angry person in general. So as an anxious attacher I had to accept that. She said our relationship was going well and she said she loves me for the first time. Everything was cool and I was happy so I stopped complaining.

In our entire relationship she complained about how ""lazy"" I am. She said she wants a partner that is stronger than her and works harder. She doesn't want me to get up in 11AM. She wanted to see me more disciplined.

Now I get that I couldn't give the attention like she wanted but at some point I really didn't know what to do. Saying are you available in tomorrow was a bad thing? She claimed that it's like not putting herself in a first position.

In January there were new interns to start working at her lab and actually I was jealous because there was a one guy that was really close to her. I get that it was nothing romantical but still they were become like best friends. Literally, she respected his opinions more than mine and it made me sad. So I tried another thing. First we argued and she said ""Do you want me to not to talk anyone?"" and I apologized and started to know him better. And after sometime I try to had calmer discussion and she said ""it is nothing to worry about""

I felt like I couldn't make her happy like I used to because she was already dealing with toxic work colleagues and when she is with me she was mostly tired or upset. We were just having sexual things mostly or watch something together. I have to accept that every time I called she found time for me. At the beginning of relationship I couldn't do that but after that I fixed myself too.

2 months ago she said she will spend time at the lab and I said I am also coming to her lab. I did but she was too determined with her work and the interns. I was already heart broken. I am okay with her obsessing over the work but she also wanted me with her. Isn't some kind of double standards? And that day I was really upset and couldn't look her face because my sadness. She said ""Wish you never came if you felt like this"" I didn't really know what she wanted. She wanted to see me but at the same time she doesn't feel happy like she used to when we spent time together. In our first two months, she was over the roof every time she sees me.

In last 2 months we had two big arguments. First she was interrupting most of the time I was talking and I was really upset and in front of her interns I said ""oh c'mon just let me talk"" I know it was total AH move. But I was so upset because I felt disrespected every time. After 4 days we solved this and moved on.

A month ago she confessed that she loved me and she wanted a future with me. I was happy again till one week later.

We were planning to go to a trip in Europe this summer but she said there is a conference in Belgium so what if we go to there instead in summer? I said okay but 3 days later, her male intern wanted to visit Europe too and she already invited her. I was like ""Whaaat?"" I already lost my exclusivity and it hurt everytime.

3 weeks ago I made a reservation in a restaurant that we always wanted to go. I did but when it's time to leave the school, she said she needs more time for her experiment and again she postponed our date and said ""the interns are hungry so lets eat together here and we'll go there after that"" it looked okay but after her putting her interns over me multiple times made me so demoralized and again I couldn't look at her face while we were eating with her interns. I was extremely upset and when we get in the car an argument started. It was the most heated one. I thought she was going to break up with me that day and I did my best to save the relationship. After that day, we went outside and I went to her home too. At first she didn't let me kiss her but last week we had some sexual tension. But she already said she lost her passion about us. 2 days ago she didn't answer her phone and at night, I called her and she said ""We need to talk"" I got what she was trying to say. We went together and she said she still loves me but we are so different. We both cried and she hugged me and she wanted me to kiss her from her cheeks and she went. It was the last time I've seen her.

  
I don't know what to think anymore folks. I really loved her. Now I have massive emptiness in myself and ask myself, how could I save this relationship? Looks like she is completely gone now and will never return. So I accepted it already and living with the pain. But c'mon folks, just tell me. AITAH?",1,1742816256.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Who are you, actually. How do you understand life and yourself. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

This leaves room in your team for 1 charger, 1 healer, and 1 strong berry finder. In the game, there are 3 types of dishes that provide at least +35% ingredient strength, and all 3 share a common key ingredient: honey.

Here are the **3 dishes** that benefit from this strategy:  
\- Dizzy Punch Spic Curry (coffe+herb+honey) (+35%)  
\- Calm Mind Fruit Salad (apple+honey+corn) (+45%)  
\- Early Bird Coffe Jelly (coffe+milk+honey) (+35%)

https://preview.redd.it/a2xlxpuoimqe1.jpg?width=637&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=991f52d875cb98e34255b50905e7199a36fa9d9d

**Requirements for the Strategy:**

* A **pot with a minimum size of 49**.
* Minimum ingredient bag capacity of 450–500 (best is 700)
* Pokémon for ingredient gathering:
   * A Pokémon that gathers **at least 48 honey per day** (a skillless level 30 AAX Venusaur works perfectly).
   * A Pokémon that gathers **at least 36 corn per day** (a skillless level 30 AAX Bewear is sufficient).
   * A Pokémon that gathers **at least 48 coffee per day** (a level 30 AAX Vikavolt with at least 1 ingredient-finding skill is suitable).
   * A Pokémon that gathers **at least 33 herbs per day** (a basic level 30 AAX Gengar will do).
   * A Pokémon that gathers **at least 63 apples per day** (a level 30 skillless AAX Skeledirge is capable).
   * A Pokémon that gathers **at least 42 milk per day** (a level 30 skillless AAX Blastoise is sufficient).

# How the Strategy Works:

1. Throughout the week, for the chosen weekly dish, you only need to gather the two non-honey ingredients until they precisely meet the required amount for that week’s recipe. Once the weekly necessity is covered, you can focus entirely on honey collection. Strong ingredient-gathering Pokémon can usually achieve this by Thursday or Friday.
2. Once you’ve secured the required non-honey ingredients, shift your focus entirely to gathering honey.
3. Collect at least **432 honey per week** (you can use multiple honey-gathering Pokémon if needed). This amount will completely cover the honey cost of any of the 3 dishes for the next week.

With this approach, you’ll only need to use 2 ingredient-gathering Pokémon throughout the week. At the end of the week, you can swap these two Pokémon for honey-gatherers to prepare for the following week efficiently. If you already have an abundance of honey, you can replace them with additional chargers or berry-finder Pokémon instead.

The advantage of this strategy is that it completely removes any dependency on the type of dish the game assigns. Thanks to the use of honey, the type of dish no longer matters—you’ll only need to gather the remaining two ingredients for the recipes.",2,1742815921.0,PokemonSleep,3,0.75,False

## Why Proper Denture Care Matters

*   **Bad Breath:** Bacteria accumulating on dentures can cause unpleasant odors and halitosis.
*   **Stains and Discoloration:** Without regular cleaning, dentures can become stained from food, drinks (like coffee and tea), and tobacco.
*   **Denture Stomatitis:** This is a fungal infection that can cause inflammation, redness, and discomfort in the mouth under the dentures.*   **Gingivitis:** Inflammation of the gums around any remaining natural teeth.
*   **Overall Health:** Studies have linked poor oral hygiene to systemic health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes.Keeping your dentures clean is integral to prevent these problems.

Thus, establishing a consistent denture cleaning routine is paramount. This routine should include daily brushing with a soft-bristled toothbrush and a denture cleaner, and also soaking your dentures in a denture cleaning solution each day. **Denture cleaning tablets** offer a convenient and effective way to disinfect and clean your dentures, supplementing your regular brushing routine.

I’m a recent transplant to the Mitten state, moved here for my career, ready to start meeting folks and building a community in the area. Happily married 20years to a loving and kind husband and we intend to date separately. We began exploring and discussing ENM and poly a few years ago, but I am new to seeking a partner for myself. Due to careers, I live in a different state from my spouse but he is aware of and supportive of me exploring new romantic relationships. 

A bit more about me: I am childfree by choice - fan of choice in general - and supportive of healthy families that come in all forms and compositions. Cis, white female. Physically I’m 5’4” black hair and light eyes. Workout 3-4 times a week but I’m a foodie with a sweet tooth, so things kind of average out in my average build with natural curves in the places where I want them. 

I am proud of and prioritize my professional pursuits during the day, but prefer to disconnect from professional obligations during the evening and weekends. My career requires a lot of extroversion, so I’m introverted in my personal time to prevent burnout. I’m an Anglophile and love a good show on Britbox and reading British WWII history. I enjoy skiing and snowshoeing in the winter when I’m not hibernating with a book and my cat. If the world of Harry Potter was real, I’d be sorted into Ravenclaw. I look forward to exploring Michigan this spring and summer and enjoy paddle boarding and nature walks. I drink my coffee black, light consumption of alcohol and a non smoker. My greatest passion is travel and I love learning about new places, people and their histories.

About you: you’ll have to fill that part in for me. Romantic preferences of mid-30 to mid-50s. I appreciate conventional attractiveness but find myself more attracted to people after I get to know them and find common, fulfilling interests.

Open to: Online connections and chat before meeting IRL for a coffee date or bookstore browse. Also welcome group meetups to make friends without pressure or expectation. Bonus if you recommend a good book or can offer a Michigan-must do list. 😊",1,1742815230.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

However, excessive noise can disrupt the experience, making it difficult for customers to enjoy their time. Poor acoustics lead to echoey, chaotic environments that drive potential customers away. The right solution? [Acoustic Wood Panels](https://www.tranquilglobal.com/acoustics/wooden-acoustic-panels.html) Cafeterias, restaurants, and cafes are vibrant social hubs where people gather for conversations, meals, and relaxation. However, excessive noise can disrupt the experience, making it difficult for customers to enjoy their time. Poor acoustics lead to echoey, chaotic environments that drive potential customers away. The right solution? **Acoustic Wood Panels**—a sophisticated and functional way to enhance the ambiance while reducing unwanted sound reflections.

# Role of Wood Acoustic Paneling in Cafeterias

Noise pollution is a significant issue in eateries. From clattering plates to chattering customers, sound waves bounce off hard surfaces, amplifying disturbances. This is where **Wood Acoustic Paneling** plays a crucial role. Designed to absorb sound and reduce reverberation, these panels create a more comfortable and inviting atmosphere. As a result, patrons can enjoy conversations without raising their voices, leading to a pleasant dining experience.

Many modern establishments are moving towards **Wooden Acoustic Panels** not only for their practical benefits but also for their aesthetic appeal. Available in various finishes, textures, and designs, these panels add warmth and sophistication to any space, aligning with contemporary and rustic decor styles alike.

# Why Cafeterias and Restaurants Need Acoustic Boards

Restaurants and cafes thrive on customer retention and positive reviews. One of the key factors influencing these aspects is the dining environment. Excessive noise can make an eatery unappealing, leading to negative feedback. **Acoustic Boards** help tackle this issue by:

* **Enhancing speech clarity**: Patrons can converse without struggling to hear each other.
* **Reducing background noise**: The hum of kitchen activities, machinery, and surrounding conversations is significantly minimized.
* **Improving overall ambiance**: A well-balanced sound environment makes for a more enjoyable dining experience.
* **Boosting footfall**: When customers feel comfortable, they are more likely to return and recommend the place to others.

# Aesthetic and Functional Benefits

One of the standout features of **Wooden Acoustic Panels** is their ability to merge style with functionality. Unlike traditional soundproofing materials that may look industrial or out of place, wood-based solutions complement interiors seamlessly. They offer:

* **Elegant design choices**: Available in different wood types, stains, and finishes to match varied aesthetics.
* **Customization options**: Businesses can choose from slatted, perforated, or grooved patterns to align with their decor.
* **Eco-friendly solutions**: Many **Acoustic Wood Panels** are crafted from sustainable sources, making them an environmentally responsible choice.
* **Durability and longevity**: High-quality wood panels withstand wear and tear, making them a cost-effective investment.

# Select the Right Acoustic Wood Panels for Cafeterias

When choosing **Acoustic Wood Panels**, factors such as panel thickness, material quality, and placement play a crucial role in achieving optimal sound absorption. Here are some key considerations:

* **Panel Type**: Perforated and grooved panels offer different levels of sound absorption. The selection depends on the noise control needs of the space.
* **Installation Area**: Wall-mounted panels are effective for absorbing direct sound reflections, while ceiling panels reduce overhead noise.
* **Material Composition**: Opting for high-density wood ensures durability and better sound absorption.
* **Maintenance Requirements**: Easy-to-clean panels are ideal for food service areas where hygiene is a priority.

# Transforming Cafeterias with Wood Acoustic Paneling

Several renowned cafes and restaurants have embraced **Wood Acoustic Paneling** to improve their dining environments. From boutique coffee shops to large-scale cafeterias, these panels have played a significant role in creating peaceful yet lively spaces.

For instance, a bustling urban café recently installed **Wooden Acoustic Panels** along its walls and ceilings. The results? A drastic reduction in noise levels, increased customer dwell time, and improved reviews. Similarly, high-end restaurants use **Acoustic Boards** strategically to ensure that diners can indulge in culinary experiences without the distraction of excessive noise.

# Conclusion

Investing in **Acoustic Wood Panels** is not just about noise control; it's about crafting an experience. In a competitive industry where ambiance holds equal importance to food quality, optimizing acoustics can make a substantial difference. Whether you run a lively cafeteria, an intimate café, or a fine-dining restaurant, incorporating [Wood Acoustic Paneling](https://www.tranquilglobal.com/acoustics/wooden-acoustic-panels.html) can transform your space, ensuring customers keep coming back for more.

A well-balanced acoustic environment leads to happier customers, better reviews, and a thriving business. So, if you’re looking to upgrade your establishment, **Wooden Acoustic Panels** should be at the top of your list!—a sophisticated and functional way to enhance the ambiance while reducing unwanted sound reflections.",1,1742815178.0,u_tranquilindiaglobal,0,1.0,False

The apartment wasn’t so much a home as a sepulcher of flickering half-light and half-lived aspirations, its lone window—a smudged, grime-caked relic—framing the serrated silhouette of New York at dusk, a skyline that jabbed upward with the spasmodic urgency of a junkie’s pulse, all concrete and steel and ambient despair. Alex slumped in a chair that groaned under him like a pensioner with bad knees, his laptop splayed open to a blank document, the cursor blinking with a relentless, accusatory rhythm—a digital metronome ticking out the seconds of his creative paralysis, each pulse a tiny indictment of his failure to muster a single goddamn sentence worth keeping. Freelance writing had once been a spark, a flicker of *something*—call it purpose, call it the faint buzz of being *alive*—but now it was a Sisyphean slog, each word a boulder he heaved uphill only to watch it tumble back down, leaving him staring at the screen like a man peering into his own open grave. His eyes, red-rimmed from too many sleepless nights and too few epiphanies, slid to the VR headset perched on the desk, its sleek contours gleaming with the promise of escape, a technological Siren whispering of the Grid—that vast, sprawling metaverse where he could slough off the sodden husk of *Alex* and step into the crisp, electric skin of *Quinn*: a figure of wit and shadow, a ghost in the machine who moved through a world of neon and code with the effortless grace Alex hadn’t felt since he was twenty-three and still believed in his own potential.

A ping sliced through the silence, sharp and insistent, a klaxon jolt that yanked him out of his stupor. His phone flared to life with a message from a gaming forum he lurked in during his more restless, insomniac hours—a digital watering hole where anonymity birthed both genius and venom in equal measure. “Need a puzzle-solver in the Grid. You in?” The sender’s handle was “Austerity,” a word that snagged on some frayed nerve in Alex’s memory, a half-remembered echo from a past he couldn’t quite pin down, like a name on the tip of your tongue that dissolves the harder you chase it.\[\^1\] His fingers hovered over the keys, trembling with a cocktail of hesitation and hunger, then tapped out, “Who are you?”

“Call me Paul. A detective, looking for answers,” the reply shot back, swift and cryptic, a verbal jab that landed somewhere between intrigue and unease.

Paul. The name floated there, a specter in the dim glow of the screen, familiar yet maddeningly out of reach, like a melody you swear you’ve heard but can’t place—maybe from a barstool confessional years ago, maybe from a dream you woke up sweating from. Alex’s pulse kicked up a notch, a faint spark of curiosity piercing the fog of his ennui, something *alive* at last in the dead zone of his days. He agreed to meet in the Grid, the decision a volatile brew of thrill and dread, like swallowing a lit match and chasing it with gasoline.

He strapped on the headset, and the real world melted away, a sandcastle dissolving under a tidal wave of code. Alex became Quinn, his avatar coalescing in the Grid’s Central Square—a riotous bazaar of avatars hustling past beneath holograms that towered overhead, barking virtual wares with the manic energy of carnival hawkers on a Ritalin binge. Quinn’s form was lean, angular, draped in a dark jacket that shimmered with encrypted patterns—a walking enigma in a sea of noise, his presence a quiet rebuttal to the chaos. Paul’s coordinates guided him to a narrow alley behind a throbbing virtual bar, the air thick with the hum of unseen data streams, a digital backroom where secrets were bartered like bootleg whiskey in Prohibition speakeasies.

Paul’s avatar loomed there, a deliberate nod to noir: trench coat flapping in a breeze that didn’t exist, fedora tilted low over eyes that gleamed with a sharpness too real for this pixelated plane, as if some shard of flesh-and-blood humanity had snuck past the Grid’s firewall. “You’re Quinn?” His voice was gruff, sandpaper over steel, modulated to fit the archetype—a voice that had smoked too many virtual Camels and seen too many digital dames double-cross their way to nowhere.

“Yes,” Quinn replied, his own voice steady, honed to a confidence Alex could only dream of outside this second skin. “What’s this about?”

“There’s a figure called Stillman leaving traces across the Grid—codes, quotes, riddles pointing to something bigger. I need to know who they are, what they want.”

“Why me?” Quinn asked, tilting his head—a gesture Alex had never quite pulled off in the real world without looking like a confused dog.

Paul’s gaze lingered, a beat too long, heavy with something unspoken. “You’re a writer. You see what’s hidden between the lines.”

Alex’s breath snagged behind the headset, a jagged hitch of panic. *How did he know?* The question burrowed into him, a splinter under the skin, but Quinn only nodded, cool as a cucumber in a cryogenic vault. “Alright. I’ll find your ghost.”

**Part 2: The Hunt, or, How to Chase a Specter Through a Hall of Mirrors**

The hunt swallowed him whole, a digital odyssey that turned days into a neon-smeared blur of code and adrenaline. Quinn tracked Stillman’s trail through the Grid’s sprawling districts, each a petri dish of ideology and excess: Neo-City, a glittering dystopia where avatars swapped cryptocurrency and curated their personal brands like late-capitalist Medicis, their egos inflated to the size of server farms; the Free Zone, a chaotic anarcho-libertarian fever dream of black markets and unfiltered data torrents, where freedom meant drowning in choice; the Dark Web District, a shadowland where the code flickered like a dying star and the air reeked of burnt circuits and existential rot, a digital Heart of Darkness minus the riverboats and plus a few extra layers of encryption. Stillman’s messages were shards of a fractured text—lines from Deleuze (“The map is not the territory, but the territory is a lie”), binary strings that unraveled into Zen koans (“What is the sound of one hand clapping in a server farm?”), whispers of a “true Grid” lurking beneath the surface, a Baudrillardian simulacrum where reality was just a rumor. Each clue dragged Quinn deeper into the maze, and with every step, Alex felt a fire flare in his chest—a sense of purpose, of being *alive* in a way he hadn’t since the last time he’d finished a sentence without wanting to claw his own eyes out.

But the hours stretched into days, then weeks, and Alex’s real life unraveled like a thrift-store sweater in a washing machine. His apartment morphed into a pit stop—microwaved burritos fossilizing on the counter, sleep snatched in fitful, sweat-soaked bursts, the headset always within arm’s reach, a lifeline to the world where he wasn’t a failure staring at a blank screen but a hunter chasing meaning through a neon jungle. In the Grid, he was Quinn, each riddle cracked open a hit of dopamine, a fleeting conviction that he could wrestle the unknown into submission. In the silence of his room, he was Alex, a wraith haunting his own existence, staring at his reflection in the laptop’s glow and wondering if the face staring back was his or just a mask he’d forgotten how to peel off. The line between them thinned to a gossamer thread, a membrane so fragile it threatened to tear, leaving him adrift in a sea of selves—Alex, Quinn, or some unholy hybrid of the two, a Frankenstein’s monster stitched together from doubt and desperation.

One night, deep in the Grid’s underbelly—a glitch-ridden wasteland where the sky shimmered with broken pixels and the ground felt like walking on a corrupted save file—Quinn stumbled on a message scrawled in glowing text across a crumbling virtual wall: “The name is a mask, but the mask is the man.” His hands shook as he transcribed it into his notebook—a battered talisman from the real world, its pages a snarl of ink and existential scribbles, a tether to the self he was losing faster than he could grasp. The words ricocheted in his skull, a riddle that sliced too close to the bone: *Who am I? Alex or Quinn? The writer or the avatar?* The question lodged in his throat like a fishhook, and no amount of swallowing could dislodge it.\[\^2\]

**Part 3: The Nexus, or, When the Mirror Cracks**

The chase climaxed in the Nexus—a swirling vortex at the Grid’s core, where data streams collided in a symphony of light and chaos, a digital omphalos where the virtual world’s navel gazed back with a thousand unblinking eyes. Stillman stood there, an avatar of flux—human one moment, a cascade of light the next, a glitch given form, a postmodern golem sculpted from code and ambiguity. Quinn approached, his voice slashing through the static like a blade through fog. “Who are you?”

Stillman’s laugh was a warped echo, a sound that shouldn’t exist in a binary cosmos, all distortion and menace. “Who are you, Quinn? Or should I call you Alex?”

Alex ripped off the headset, the real world crashing into him like a runaway semi. His chest heaved, sweat slicking his forehead, the apartment walls throbbing as if they’d sprouted arteries. *How did Stillman know his name?* The question clawed at him, shredding the flimsy scaffolding of certainty he’d built. Was the Grid seeping into reality, a digital hemorrhage flooding his brain, or had he finally snapped, his mind a cracked LCD spitting error codes into the void? He paced, the hardwood creaking beneath him like the moans of a sinking ship, the notebook splayed open on the desk—a chaotic atlas of his disintegration: “In this city of glass and code, I chase a name that slips through my fingers.” The words mocked him, a riddle with no solution, a Zen koan designed to drive you mad. He jammed the headset back on, desperation overriding sanity.

Quinn faced Stillman again, the wasteland unchanged, a purgatory of fractured pixels. “How do you know me?”

Stillman’s form flickered, a smile curling like smoke through a shattered mirror. “Maybe I’m more than code. Maybe I’m a memory.”

Before Quinn could fire back, Paul materialized beside them, trench coat billowing in a wind that wasn’t there, a noir cliché dialed to eleven. “Enough games,” Quinn snapped, his voice a honed edge of frustration. “Who are you, Paul? Why do I feel like I’ve known you forever?”

Paul’s voice softened, shedding its gravelly veneer like a snake sloughing skin. “Maybe you have.”

The Grid quaked, and the wasteland dissolved. They stood in the Nexus proper—a vortex where light twisted and bent, a singularity of data and longing, a place where the virtual and the real bled into each other like ink on wet paper. Stillman and Paul faced Quinn, their avatars trembling on the brink of collapse, pixels fraying like threads in a worn-out tapestry.

“Show me,” Quinn demanded, his voice a blade tempered by desperation.

Stillman’s form stabilized into a face Alex knew—Jamie, a friend he’d shoved out of his life years ago over a fight so petty he couldn’t even recall the details, a rift he’d let fester like a wound gone septic. Paul’s pixels resolved into Sam, a lover whose exit had carved a void Alex had tried to fill with whiskey and words, failing spectacularly at both. The recognition slammed into him like a fist to the sternum, stealing his breath, the headset fogging with tears that blurred the line between worlds.

“Jamie?” Alex’s voice broke through Quinn’s avatar, raw and human, a sound too real for this digital stage. “Sam? What is this?”

Jamie’s eyes were soft, aching, a pixelated echo of a pain he’d caused. “We wanted to see if you’d find us—if the Alex we knew was still in there, behind the masks.”

Sam’s smile was bittersweet, his form trembling as if the Grid couldn’t hold him. “In the Grid, we could be anyone. We chose to be your echoes, to see if you’d hear us.”

Alex’s hands quaked, the real and the virtual colliding in a cacophony of regret and revelation. “I didn’t mean to lose you. I was drowning back then, and I still am.”

“You’re not drowning,” Jamie said, her voice steady despite the flicker of her form. “You’re here, as Quinn. You found us.”

“But who am I?” Alex whispered, the question a knife twisting in his gut. “Alex or Quinn?”

Sam reached out, his hand dissolving into light, a gesture as fleeting as a memory. “Maybe you’re both. Maybe neither.”

The Nexus pulsed, and the Grid began to unravel—walls of code collapsing, the vortex spinning into a maelstrom of light and noise, a digital apocalypse threatening to swallow them whole. Alex tore off the headset, collapsing into his chair, the apartment a suffocating box of stale air and regret, the city lights beyond the window a cruel parody of the Grid’s glow. Jamie and Sam’s faces lingered, haunting him—were they real, reaching through the digital ether, or just phantoms conjured by his guilt, AI ghosts stitched from the tatters of his past?

**Part 4: The Real World, or, The Unbearable Lightness of Being Alex**

Days slogged by, each a trudge through molasses-thick despair. Alex dodged the Grid, clinging to the real world like a castaway to a splintered plank. He met Jamie at a coffee shop so cramped it felt like a coffin with Wi-Fi, their words halting, freighted with years of unspoken remorse—her presence a corporeal shock after the Grid’s ephemerality, her flesh-and-blood reality a jarring counterpoint to the digital specters he’d chased. Sam texted—an apology, a lifeline—but Alex’s fingers froze over the reply, the words bottlenecked in his throat like a traffic jam on the road to redemption. The real world was a shadow, its hues muted against the technicolor blaze he’d known as Quinn, its edges too soft, too forgiving.

He tried to write, to root himself in Alex’s life, but the blank document was a void, unyielding as a black hole. His notebook overflowed with fragments: “I am a name, a shadow, a city of glass and ghosts.” The words rang truer than anything he’d lived lately, a confession etched in invisible ink on the skin of his soul.

One night, the pull grew too fierce, a tidal force he couldn’t resist. He donned the headset, and Quinn stood once more in the Nexus, alone. The mystery was solved—Jamie and Sam unmasked—but a deeper question gnawed at him, a splinter under the skin: *Who am I, beneath the names?*

He opened his notebook, its pages a map of his unraveling. “In this city of glass and code, I chase a name that slips through my fingers.” The line shifted in his mind, a kaleidoscope clicking into place. Maybe the name wasn’t slipping away. Maybe it was waiting to be claimed.

With a steady hand, he scratched out “Alex” and scrawled “Quinn” above it. A weight lifted, light as a sigh, a moment of grace in the chaos. He logged back into the Grid, the Nexus unfurling before him like a homecoming, its vortex a mirror reflecting all his possible selves.

“Welcome back, Quinn,” the system intoned, its voice a balm on a wound he hadn’t known was bleeding.

He smiled, the sound of his name a quiet epiphany, a truth wrested from the wreckage. “I’m home.”

**Footnotes**

\[\^1\]: “Austerity” derives from the Latin *austerus*, meaning “severe” or “stern,” and by extension evokes both the fiscal policies that gutted social safety nets in the post-2008 era and the emotional austerity of Alex’s life—a barrenness of connection that’s less a choice than a default state.

\[\^2\]: The notebook as talisman calls to mind Lacan’s mirror stage—the moment the self is both recognized and alienated in its reflection—but here it’s inverted: Alex/Quinn gazes into the pages and sees not a unified image but a kaleidoscope of fragments, a self splintered across realities.

1jinzxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Worldbox/comments/1jinzxu/some_tips_and_ticks_for_beginner_players/,Some Tips and Ticks for beginner players.,"Every once in a while I see new players asking for tips, so I decided to compile some useful things I've learnt for my 6 years of playing the game (though 99% of the knowledge I have is outdated now...).

So here are some tips and tricks for the current (0.22) version of the game:

# Moving units between kingdoms/villages

Under normal circumstances, units (humans, elves etc.) will not move to another villages, unless they are settlers tasked with creating a colony or their home village was completely destroyed. However, they still keep their kingdom allegiance in both cases.

But you can actually move them yourself, even between kingdoms!   
All you have to do is:  
  
1. pause the game  
2. apply madness on a chosen unit (be aware it affects other units around the tile too)  
3. apply divine light  
4. use the divine magnet to move the chosen unit into another village  
5. unpause the game  
  
Applying madness causes the unit to lose its village and kingdom allegiance, while keeping all other stats, including culture. Divine light heals them from the madness status so they won't attack people around them and using the magnet to place the unit will cause it to be instantly assigned to the village and kingdom where it currently stands. Pausing the game makes the process easier.

The units also won't retain their city leader/king professor, so it can be also used to force someone's abdication without bloodshed.

# Accelerating Cultures

Cultures are crucial for technological advancements, so speeding up their knowledge gain is very useful.  
Gaining knowledge (which is how the tech system called) is actually tied to the intelligence of city leaders.  
This means that the culture will develop faster, if there are many city leaders with high intelligence who belong to this culture.

You can increase intelligence of units by giving them specific traits, like ""genius"". However, there's a better way to do this, in form of coffee.  
Coffee gives a unit a temporary status called ""caffeinated"", which increases their intelligence to absurd levels, having multiple caffeinated city leaders can advance the culture by several levels in second.

However, this status is temporary. But not quite...  
You see, there is a bug in the current version of the game, causing cultures to develop **even when the game is paused**, while the status will remain, because it's affected by pause.

# Increasing Armies

Cultures are not the only feature where city leaders are crucial. The number of soldiers in each city is actually dependent on their warfare skill.  
The higher it is, the more soldiers will be conscripted. Unfortunately, the only way to influence this is by changing traits.  
""Bloodlust"" is the best for increasing the stat, while ""Pacifist"" is great for decreasing it.

# Debug Menu

Click the burger in the settings menu multiple times, until the special button in the top right appears. Just be aware that some stuff here can break the game.  
However, the most useful options there are:  
FastSpawn (useful on mobile, allows for spawning units by holding instead of tapping), SonicSpeed (40x speed, no premium required!)  
ShowAmountNearArmy and ShowWarriorsCityText (displays the number of soldiers in a more useful way)  
And almost everything in the Civ Cheats section, they are quite self-explanatory.

# Instant 1 HP

A combo of ""cursed"" and ""tiny"" traits instantly lowers the max health of every unit to 1. You can give this trait combo to units like evil mage or demon for example, so they can be killed by units from kingdoms, allowing them to capture rare weapons, like staffs, special swords, blasters etc.

There are also many more tips and tricks I have (like that mines and ores are dependent on biomes) but this post is long enough. I might make a part 2 sometime in the future.

1jinykv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jinykv/the_birds_are_wild_this_morning_one_of_them_just/,The Birds are Wild this morning - one of them just ate the dog.,"They say country life is slower. Simpler. Cleaner.

That’s why I moved here.

Six months ago, I left the chaos of London behind and took a veterinary post in the Wye Valley, tucked among low ridges and thick, brooding forests. It was a town where no one locked their doors, sheep grazed under telephone lines, and the pub closed when the bartender got tired. My house sat just outside the village—an old stone shell with ivy-strangled gutters and floors that creaked like they remembered better decades.

I came for the silence. The kind that stretches for miles. The kind that leaves you alone with your own breathing.

And until last week, it was perfect.

That’s when the birds got strange.

That’s when one of them ate the dog.

••

The call came just after six.

I’d been up since five, sipping burnt instant coffee and watching mist slither through the hedgerows. No birdsong. No wind. Just the river at the bottom of the field, flat and dull as steel wool.

I remember the way the silence pressed in—like the world had stopped between breaths.

The landline rang like it was trying to wake the house.

*“Dr. Carter,”* I answered.

*“It’s Jack,”* said the voice, sharp and hoarse. *“Something’s wrong.”*

My brain hadn’t caught up yet. *“Wrong how?”*

*“The birds are wild this morning.”*

*“…What birds?”*

There was a pause. His voice dropped a register. *“One of them ate my dog.”*

I thought he was drunk. Or joking.

But his tone was clipped. Bruised with fear.

*“Come out here,”* he said. *“You need to see this.”*

••

Jack Whittaker lived a mile out of town, where the past still had roots. Retired gamekeeper. Proud bastard. Raised a few sheep and chickens, mostly to keep busy. He and his dog, Baxter, were inseparable.

He met me at the gate, shotgun in one hand, eyes sunken and bloodshot. He didn’t speak—just turned and walked.

The coop was still standing, though every bird inside was silent.

Behind it, in a flattened patch of grass, was what was left of Baxter.

I’m no stranger to death. I’ve seen mangled cows, lambs stuck half-born, foxes gutted by combine blades. But this…

Baxter was torn open at the middle, ribs split like snapped tusks. His head was intact—but punctured, clean through the cranium in three places. I’d seen surgical tools leave less deliberate wounds.

*“Tell me this was a dog,”* Jack whispered.

I crouched. The carcass still steamed in the cold. The flesh was too cleanly opened. No ragged tear. No chewing. The kind of wound a butcher makes when he knows exactly where to cut.

I glanced toward the forest. Something in me tightened.

*“What did you see?”*

*“I didn’t.”* He sounded ashamed. *“I heard the chickens go mad, then Baxter barked. I stepped outside and… it was already on him. Dark, low to the ground. Feathers, but not like any bird I’ve ever seen. It moved… wrong. Like it was built to run. Like a scary ostrich”*

He swallowed. *“Its eyes were yellow. Not golden. Yellow.”*

I stood. *“Show me the tracks.”*

••

The ground near the fence line was soft from the night’s frost. And there they were.

Three-toed prints.

Each about the size of my outstretched hand, claws like hooks gouged deep into the mud. But what stood out wasn’t their shape.

It was the *precision.*

The spacing between each step was identical. Dead straight, like it walked along a chalk line.

Nothing in the woods moved like that.

No bird. No dog. No deer.

I bent low, pressing my hand into the center of one.

The soil was compacted hard, nearly two inches deep.

Whatever it was—it was heavy.

Too heavy to fly.

*“Could be a boar?”* Jack said.

*“No.”* Jack never was the sharpest tool in the shed

He nodded slowly. *“I didn’t think so.”*

••

I spent the rest of the day going through old field guides. Dinosaur textbooks from university. I wasn’t looking for confirmation. I was looking for *impossibility.*

But there it was.

A raptor.

Not like in the films—these were leaner, more avian. Quill-feathered. Sickled claws. Built to strike.

Impossible.

But so was Baxter.

••

That night I couldn’t sleep.

I kept the curtains closed, rifle by the door.

Around midnight, I heard it.

A low **huff**, like steam venting through a valve. Then a **chirp**—not a bird’s warble, but three short, flutelike notes. High. Medium. Medium.

Then silence.

I waited.

Nothing.

••

The second call came the next evening.

*“It’s back,”* Jack said.

By the time I got there, the sun had vanished behind the trees, bleeding a rust-red haze across the fields.

Jack met me in the lane. He was pale, shaking.

*“It’s in the barn.”*

We approached slow. The main doors were ajar, one hinge twisted, the frame clawed.

Inside, it stank of meat.

And something else.

Warm earth. Piss. Sweat.

Predator.

Jack clicked on his flashlight.

The beam passed over hay, a broken pitchfork—

And then, it froze.

The thing was crouched over a sheep, chest torn open, head buried in the cavity.

It lifted its head.

Bright green and blue feathers slick with blood lined its back, bristling like wet pine needles. Its body was compact but powerful—every muscle coiled for motion.

And then it *turned.*

Not its body—just its head.

It rotated smoothly, mechanically, eyes swiveling toward the light.

A gyroscopic pivot, like a mounted camera.

That eye was vertical and narrow, ringed in burnt orange. It didn’t blink.

Just locked.

Watching.

A sharp *huff* burst from its throat.

Then a sequence of chirps—short, medium-pitched, patterned like a code.

I froze.

From the woods, I heard an answering chirp.

Jack cursed under his breath.

I raised the rifle.

Fired.

The crack echoed through the rafters.

The creature shrieked, leapt sideways—faster than I thought possible. Its feet scraped along the boards, talons gouging the wall.

It didn’t retreat.

It maneuvered.

Turned.

Tracked.

Its body dipped low again—one back leg shifting for leverage, forearms curled in like a bird of prey preparing to strike.

I fired again.

Missed.

It vanished into the shadows.

••

We didn’t sleep.

We waited in Jack’s kitchen, lights off. The field was silent.

Then, sometime past two, we heard it again.

***Huff. Chirp. Chirp. Chirp.***

Outside.

Close.

We held our breath.

A shadow passed the window.

Low to the ground. Fast.

But it didn’t test the house.

It circled.

We counted two. Maybe three.

••

At dawn, they were gone.

Jack looked like hell.

I went home, numb.

I told myself maybe they were gone. Maybe it was a one-off.

I slept for two hours.

Then I drove back to Jack’s.

His front door was open.

Chickens loose.

The coop was torn apart.

Blood on the steps.

No sign of Jack.

Only tracks.

In the mud.

Circling the house.

Again.

••

I don’t know what these things are.

But they aren’t confused.

They aren’t lost.

They’re hunting.

And they’re watching.

••

I’ve boarded my doors. Moved everything down to the cellar.

If anyone hears this—listen to me.

Stay out of the woods.

Stay near light.

They move with purpose.

And they remember.

I’ll keep updating.

While I still can.

We stayed at Pop Century 90s area, and our plan was to hit up Epcot, Magic Kingdom, and Hollywood studios. We were very rides and character focused but not interested in thrill rides (I'm pregnant and my daughter is very iffy on fast rides and drops, and none of us love coasters). My daughter's priorities were: meeting toy story characters, meeting frozen characters, and meeting Moana; my husband's was Star wars. No sit down meals etc because we figure we have great food in the city we're in and we'd rather spend the time doing stuff we can't do elsewhere, and don't want to spend a lot over what we're already spending. Our main splurges were LL and memory Maker.

We got the LLMP and i was up at the dot of 7am to book my rides 7 days in advance. We were able to get: EPCOT: Remy's (chose 4pm), figment around 9:30, Nemo's around 10:30. Magic Kingdom: Peter Pan 9:20, haunted Mansion 10:45, Winnie the Pooh 11:45. Hollywood studios: Allen swirling saucers: 9:50, slinky dog dash 10:30, toy story mania 11:30. We tried to book an early ride to start churning, and book times/places that were close together to minimize walking. We also bought rise of the resistance for my husband and daughter for 4pm.

Day 1: EPCOT
Left hotel room around 7:15 and took the skyliner, arriving at Epcot frozen early entry area about 5 minutes before they dropped the rope. Skyliner line was long but they started it running before 7:30 and it moved quickly. Took advantage of the skyliner and security lines to eat grocery breakfast and sunscreen, etc. 

Waited maybe 20 minutes for frozen ever after (we were really impressed by the animatronics!) and then immediately got in line to meet Elsa and Anna before that opened at 9:15. Probably waited about 15 minutes, but the little house and decorations were cute to see while waiting. They were lovely! (But my daughter was pretty shy despite being very excited). The photo box pictures were decent and I took my own too. We got school bread and a chocolate horn at kringla bakery, then went to the gran fiesta boat tour which had just reopened from refurbishment that day. It was a walk on at around 9:30 and was a nice chill pretty ride that we all enjoyed. 

We looked at the topiaries - kiddo was very excited for the Woody and Bo Peep ones - on the way to figment. We all enjoyed that ride and the games in the post-ride area. I immediately booked a LL for Soarin for around 2pm. We did a quick bathroom break and my daughter changed from her frozen to Moana outfit. 

We got in line to meet Moana a little before the posted time and probably waited about 15 minutes. Then we went to the Nemo ride, and were pleasantly surprised by the cool animations superimposed on the real fish, and the manatees and after-ride area as well. With that LL freed up, I booked spaceship Earth for 12:50. 

After Nemo, my husband and daughter explored journey of water while I picked up our mobile order from connections Cafe. The hot honey chicken sandwich was great! Also, the water from fountain drinks doesn't taste like swamp! I'd tried drinking from the water fountain in the Nemo after ride area and almost threw up (I'm extra sensitive being pregnant) so was very grateful to fill up water bottles at connections. After getting food, i joined everyone at journey of water which was so cool, a great break from lines and standing around, and perfect for midday when it was starting to get hot. Also the magic shots in front of Te fiti were fun.

We all went to connections to sit and eat a late lunch.  We rode spaceship Earth. It was fine, but I'd slept badly the night before and fell asleep lol. I used that freed up LL to book living with the land. We went to the main entrance area and did the iconic photo pass shots with the ball, and with the gorgeous Moana topiaries. We looped by the World Discovery area to find the Buzz topiary, and through world celebration, where we happened upon a cool acrobatic performance on a pole/lyra ball-like contraption. The performers were lovely and took pictures with my daughter who was super excited to meet them. 

We rode on Soarin, which we all agreed was our favorite ride and tricked our brains way more than we expected! Then we rode living with the land - my daughter was delighted to point out the Moana references in the ride. Then we went to the butterfly garden. 

It was pretty warm at that point since it was a clear sunny day, plus the greenhouse butterfly garden, so we went to France pavilion for ice cream brioche sandwiches. Quite expensive, but unique and just what we needed to cool off. We rode Remy's, which was delightful, but I can't imagine waiting an hour for!  And then we were out of the park and back in the skyliner by 5pm. We skipped most of the bottom loop and the outdoor kitchens because it was significantly more crowded (I'm guessing because of festival-oriented locals?) and we had no interest in dealing with crowds and waiting in lines for food with a fidgety kid who didn't care at all about the food and wouldn't eat any of it. This was also our rest/early night because we were planning to rope drop early entry the next day and stay through fireworks. Back at the resort I took a much needed nap while my husband took my daughter to the pool. We ate uncrustables for dinner and slept by 9-10ish. It was a pretty perfect day! My daughter said ""best day ever!"", loved meeting the characters, loved the rides, and had no major issues or meltdowns. 

Day 2: magic Kingdom 
Left the hotel room by 7:10 for the bus. We were pretty early until an umbrella and metal coffee can got me stuck in a bag check security line (lesson learned!) but we still made it to the Tomorrowland early entry rope drop area about 10 minutes before it opened. Our strategy was to LL the stuff with traditionally long wait and use early entry to ride all the less competitive rides as much as we wanted. (No interest in mine train or space mountain, LL for Peter Pan and Winnie the Pooh). We went straight to buzz light-year space ranger ride given my daughter's obsession with toy story, and she loved it so much we rode it 2 more times. It was a walk on to maybe a few minutes wait max all 3 times. 

Then we went to the speedway which was okay, and my daughter enjoyed, but to me it just seemed like smelly go carts that you can ride anywhere so not sure I'd prioritize it next time. We went to barnstormer by about 915/930, which had minimal wait, and it was too scary for my daughter. So that was a good litmus test since she wanted to do slinky dog the next day! So we started to prep her for the possibility that she might not like slinky dog. 

We did our first LL, Peter Pan, with minimal wait and we all loved it. With that freed up LL I immediately booked jungle Cruise which already had like a 6pm return time. Then went straight to small world, which was maybe a 10 to 15 minute wait. Also a hit, and nostalgic for me. We did haunted mansion, which was not scary for my kid. I rode this as a 4 year old and remember the stretching room really well, including the lightning and a body hanging from the ceiling, but I think they got rid of the body so that surprised me. The placement of the hitchhiking ghosts was also different from what I remembered as a kid. Anyways. With that freed LL I booked pirates for 5pm. 

We had some time before needing to be at Winnie the Pooh, so we rode the carousel, and went to enchanted tales with Belle. My daughter was all in on wanting to participate and got cold feet when we got into the wardrobe room and wanted to be picked up and leave lol. But after lots of reassurance that she could just watch, she enjoyed the show and was excited to get a bookmark from Belle. Little mermaid had a posted 5 minute wait but ended up being more like a 15 to 20 minute wait... The ride kept stopping, and we saw a cast member retrieve a shoe from the tracks. Kiddo got antsy in line but enjoyed the ride. We got delicious pastries at Gaston's tavern and took a break since we'd been doing rides non-stop all morning. 

We rode Winnie the Pooh (I loved the tigger section!) and then watched Mickey's friendship faire. I booked spinning tea cups with that LL. My daughter actively doesn't care for Mickey but was very excited for Elsa and Anna so loved the show. It was impressive! We did the classic castle photo pass shots, and rode the carousel again, rode spinning tea cups, and did standby for Dumbo. I'd heard that you could play in a play area while waiting on line for Dumbo, but saw no evidence of this, so idk. Booked magic carpet with my free LL.

We mobile ordered from Columbia harbor House, and rested a bit, did a bathroom break. We thought the food was okay but were grateful to have a healthier option, and the lobster rolls were relatively reasonably priced in our opinion. We refilled our water bottles with the cups from the servers but sadly it was all swampy but not as bad as Nemo water. 

We made our way down to Liberty square/Adventureland area where they were starting to rope off for the 3pm parade. A random country bear greeted my daughter and totally won her over lol. Generally everyone was super kind to her and wished her happy birthday so much that she asked to take her happy birthday button off lol. We watched the parade which has a seriously impressive dragon float idk what movie it's from but it was seriously cool. We got a good uncrowded spot by the ice cream cart by the water. 

We went straight to the country bears show, after the bear made a new fan of my daughter. We rode the raft to Tom Sawyer Island and had a blast roaming the caves and mines and jumping around on the barrel bridge. We see the ferry boat, and my daughter decides she wants to ride that, so we do that next. But then we were pretty tired so the slow boat ride was nice and relaxing and a good opportunity to sit. 

We watched the friendship cavalcade at around 5pm, which was super short. We were trying to see it and were confused at first why they weren't clearing the streets the way the did for the parade - then realized it's because it was only like 2 seconds long lol. However, it had toy story characters so immediately became my daughter's favorite. 

We rode magic carpets, and then pirates. The kiddo liked the ride okay but then got mad at the unexpected drop in the dark and got super grumpy. But then she wanted a sword from the gift shop and it was only $10 so we got it, and that redeemed the ride lol. At some point, I book a LL for buzz light-year because i was thinking it might be good to end the day with my daughter's favorite ride, but the earliest return time was already 8:10pm - booked it anyway.  

At this point it's starting to rain, so we poncho up, and put the rain cover on the stroller. We have a little time before the jungle Cruise return time so we check out the tiki room show and we all get slightly sleepy. Thankfully, it's not raining hard and they keep rubbing jungle Cruise which we all enjoyed. 

At this point, it's about 6:30 and we've hit up all the rides we wanted to. We'd wanted to check out the tree house but don't anymore given the rain. So we assess whether we wanna do anything again, or wanna meet any other characters. My daughter asks to meet Ariel, which had a posted 15 minute wait, so we high tail it over to the grotto to meet her before it ends for the day. The wait is only maybe 5 mins, and she ends up loving Ariel even though she's never seen the movie. We go straight to the little mermaid ride which has a 5 minute posted wait but it's basically walk on at this point. After, my daughter asks to ride it again so we do, so the second time the cast member offers to just let us stay on because there's literally nobody else within sight of us on the ride. 

It's getting dark and we head back to Tomorrowland and ride people mover, which was a nice long opportunity to sit down and was pretty cool. We consider dinner but none of us are very hungry, so just eat our snacks. We went to stay for fireworks and I'm torn between riding more stuff and trying to find a good spot since it's about 7:50 at this point. Buzz has a 15 minute posted wait and kiddo wants to ride it again so we do, and have a blast (for the 4th time lol). At this point, it's 8:10 and basically our LL return time, but we cutting it close to fireworks time. We decide we don't care about a spot and ride buzz a 5th time. Totally worth it.

After the ride, we race to the bathrooms, and race back towards main Street. It's basically 8:28 and we get off the bridge to Tomorrowland and snag a spot right of the bridge and the fireworks start. We have a great view of the fireworks and castle and I'm so glad we didn't waste time sitting around because our spot was perfectly great! The show was amazing, though my poor husband had to hold the kid the whole time so she could see. 

After the show, we joined the mass exodus to the bus lines. We made sure to brush the kids teeth right after the show and she immediately passed out and slept the whole way back until the next morning. Man I missed the skyliner with letting you get on without breaking down the stroller. But another pretty perfect (but exhausting) day! 

Day 3: Hollywood studios
Today was our day to ""sleep in"" given the extremely long day at magic Kingdom with no expectation the be at the park until our first return window between 9:50 to 10:50. But being used to the schedule at this point, the kid wakes up at 7:30, so we end up at Hollywood studios, even taking our time, by 9:15 or so. 

For some reason, the kid decides she totally doesn't wanna meet Olaf or so the frozen sing along so we skip that entirely. We head straight to toy story land, and go straight to meet Woody and Jessie. The line is really long and the performers need to take breaks and swap out. We probably wait about 30 minutes? But my daughter is absolutely thrilled. She drew pictures to give them and they carefully examined them and fawned over them and were so lovely. We filmed and took pictures on our own camera of the whole interaction. I'm so glad we did, because the photo pass photographer (not a photo box) totally didn't! I actually would've preferred a photo box because it'd just take a bunch of random candids and capture the interactions, but the photographer only took a handful of posed photos when they were all standing together and smiling and none of my daughter giving Woody and Jessie her drawings and of them looking at the pictures and holding them up and giving her hugs. So definitely recommend taking your own video and pictures! 

After that, we rode alien swirling saucers which was really fun and not like any spinny ride I've tried before! My daughter, while in line to meet Woody, definitely decides she does not want to get on slinky dog and is content to just see it. So we cancel that LL and book Mickey and Minnie runaway train for the afternoon, I think around 1pm. And after alien swirling saucers, I book millennium falcon for 3ish. 

We go meet buzz light-year (who has a much shorter line than Woody), and my daughter is thrilled because he's her favorite. We'd been collecting signatures on a photo mat thus far, and buzz has her help him karate chop his autograph stamp onto the mat. As far as she concerned, this day has been a massive success 😂 We do a photo pass photo on front of toy story land, and we schedule a mobile order from docking Bay 7. 

We ride toy story mania, which was also really fun. My husband and daughter was on one side and I was by myself on the other so I ended up scoring pretty high (for a bad shooter) with no competition lol. Then we eat lunch at docking Bay 7 and the food is great! We missed our mobile order window by 5 minutes and it didn't pull up on the app but a cast member helped us and it was fine. 

We go to sunset boulevard and watch beauty and the beast live, which was my request but we all enjoyed it. We showed up just a couple minutes before it started but there was plenty of seating despite the crowds in general being a lot higher than the previous 2 days of parks. Then we rode runway railway which was also fun!

We wanted to really get immersed in star wars stuff later that afternoon so before our return time we decided to check out everything else first. We went into the historic displays area where live action Ariel was hidden - and we did a meet and greet there with no wait. I was impressed that her signature and the magic Kingdom Ariel's signatures were in the and handwriting! We went to Muppet vision 3D, but my daughter thought it was boring and the extreme 3D-ness made me fall asleep. We also looked at the star wars exhibits.

Then we started to explore Galaxy's edge and it was so cool and immersive!! My husband took my daughter on millennium falcon and Rise of the resistance since I couldn't ride those and they both loved both rides. We generally explored the shops and ambiance, and enjoyed seeing the storm troopers and kylo ren. My daughter totally didn't care about Star wars, until riding the rides, and until Vi Moradi (none of us had ever heard of her) came up to my daughter and had a long conversation with her about needing her help to keep an eye on the storm troopers. After that, my kid took the task extremely seriously and followed the storm troopers around surreptitiously lol. Later, there was a mini skit/interaction between Vi Moradi and the storm troopers and my kid was very worried that they found Vi and went back and talked to her and she remembered her and told her to keep keeping an eye on the storm troopers lol. Husband also takes daughter on Star tours, which i also can't ride.

It was getting late, so I mobile ordered pizza and subs from Catalina Eddie's. I didn't realize the closee pizza place closed at 5 and ronto rosters 3 apparently only stayed open until 3 so that was a bummer. My husband and kid kept exploring Star wars land and keeping an eye on the storm troopers and even saw Chewbacca wandering around, while picked up our mobile order over at sunset boulevard, and we sat down and ate it in the outside area of docking Bay 7. 

All the ride wait times had been pretty long all day and we'd used up our LLs on everything we care to ride. Star tours is only 5 minutes stand by but nobody cares about riding that again, and alien swirling saucers is a 15 minute stand by wait, and my daughter wants to do that one again. So we decide this is going to be our last ride of the night and get on line. It's more than 15 minutes, so again, we cut it suuuuuper close to fireworks time at 8:30. Especially because we promised my daughter one toy story toy that trip that had yet to be purchased. 

We get off the ride at about 8:15, and I take my daughter for one last bathroom trip while my husband high tails it to the gift shop of toy story mania to buy a Slinky Dog and we speed walk to the fireworks. The path to the amphitheater is way longer than we expect! It's very crowded by the time we get there with only a couple minutes to spare. We sit on the far end which isn't ideal but are still pretty close and can see everything. We love the show which is so creative and different from the magic Kingdom show and special in its own way. We again brush my daughter's teeth right after the show and she immediately passes out on the way to the skyliner.

All in all, we got so lucky with the weather! Not crazy hot, and it only rained a bit in the evening if our magic Kingdom day but didn't result in anyone being cancelled. I was worried about the crowds given spring break and the flower and garden festival just starting but it was honestly okay. We maybe avoided the worst of it by choice at Epcot by staying in the upper loop and not staying late. Magic Kingdom was honestly fine all day, and Hollywood studios seemed the most crowded but was also honestly fine given that we were mostly there to soak up atmosphere rather than wait in a lot of lines. I was nervous, given that I'm not experienced at all in planning these trips but we had a pretty perfect experience!! It really honestly couldn't have been better!

Biting down on the seat belt wrapped around my arm and chest, I fight to stay still and conscious. The bones in my left arm shatter under the sheer sudden weight of the growing muscle. Fragments lodge themselves in my flesh and veins, small pieces of white pushing their way to the surface of my skin and breaking through as the dense muscle finds its place to settle. Slowly like magnets, they draw themselves to each other again, tearing their way back underneath as they grow at the same time, connecting and extending my arm an extra foot than it was before. My fingers follow suit, snapping and extending further out. The fingernails rapidly rot and peel off my swollen fingertips as new ones push themselves to the surface, turning into monstrous claws. Gritting my teeth I feel the flesh on my arm burning off, the car seat I was holding onto with my claws melting along with it. With my right hand, I grab whatever molten loose skin still hung and tear it off, letting a patch of dark black hair sprout from the blood underneath. The arm begins to steam as the temperature levels itself out, the transformation coming to a slow, allowing me a moment to breathe and cry. I lean against the door of my car and release the seat belt from my jaw, the taste of metal in my mouth making me gag heavily. With my remaining arm, I try to shove the door open again, but the tree and snow outside refuse to give. I vomit whatever I had left in my stomach, and the blood in my mouth onto my lap as I begin to pass out. At least now I will be warm.

  
  
In search of comfort, my mind automatically drifts to my grandfather. The recently deceased man of six foot five, lived to the ripe age of 110, breaking several records for being the only person on earth to be over a century old and still bench 400. Despite being the absolute tank on legs that he was, the old man spoke with the calming voice of a still ocean. Most of my childhood was under his care after my mother and father had passed from unforeseen circumstances when I was around 3. During the heavy winter snow when family was over, he sang the loudest carols, shaking the entire skeleton of his manor. It was his voice that had brought me into my adulthood, taught me my life lessons, and formed and shaped my morals. The entire mountain mourned the day we discovered his body.

  
  
The man would have lived until 200 if given the chance, but instead, he decided to keep his demons to himself, settling for a bullet to the brain. No matter how much I begged to see his body one more time before they put him to rest, the coroner refused. The funeral and burial were closed casket, and I was left only with memories, and the manor. The hundreds of thousands of books he had collected were all left to me, while it was decided that the rest of the family, oddly accepting of his sudden departure, would split and sell the manor once I was done collecting what I would take with me. I doubted an entire library would fit inside a 2 room New York apartment, so with approved time off from work, I was allowed the winter to spend in the mountain top manor to sort through the books and relics, deciding which would be better suited for a museum, and which would look nice on my cheap IKEA shelf. According to my uncle Calcius, the manor was still well stocked enough to last a man a year if he chose to stay. So in mid-November, I packed my items and made for my childhood home.

  
  
The manor welcomed me back with warm open arms like the old man once did, becoming its own tour guide as I roamed the silent halls that I once ran down. Every time I entered a room or stopped to recall a painting or a decoration, the manor would ask in a calm deep voice, “Hey remember that?” and my smile would respond. “yes, I do.” To fight back the frost growing on the window I turned on the monstrous furnace in the cellar. It woke from its months-long sleep with a mighty roar before the mouth returned to a friendly fiery smile, breathing heat into the rooms and hallways. I was home.

  
  
I woke screaming, feeling my spine pop and force itself to separate. Vertebrae from vertebrae, my skin, and muscle tearing and stretching to try to accommodate the extending bone that was underneath. I writhed, my body still held tight against the car seat by the belt, I lifted my leg and pushed my foot against the dash as my hand searched desperately for a lever under the seat, trying to launch the seat backward and give myself more room. Instead, my shin shatters, my leg snapping downwards and sending a bloody bony stump stabbing into the dash. My eyes blur as I try to focus on the other part of my leg hanging underneath. Muscle and tendons growing rapidly like vines along a white branch, the bone extending fingers trying to interlace back together with my body. My fingers finally find the lever, pull it, and slide my seat back, letting my shin bone slip from the dash and snap back into place with the rest of my leg. The windshield starts to crack, the sudden heat inside the car fighting against the frozen air outside. My neck snaps to one side as my spine keeps rebuilding itself, my shirt and jacket melding together with my discarded skin, a disgusting soup of cloth and flesh. With no other choice, I force myself up and bang my head against the steering wheel as hard as I can. Again, and again, and again, until all my eyes could see was red, and then again.  




Underneath the large main staircase of the manor is a beautiful wood and glass hallway that leads to my grandfather's study. According to my aunt Patricia, the study used to be a rather large sunroom that she used to, as a child, spend summer in, lying on the ground and staring up into the sky watching clouds and birds pass. One summer, when the rest of the family was away, the old man decided to renovate, and by himself, he turned the sunroom into what it is now. The glass dome ceiling remained, now covered for the winter, and the walls of the room were lined with shelves full of books and trinkets. My cousins and I used to call this room the 'Wizard dungeon.' a large golden globe sat near the entrance, larger than a coffee table with wooden lion's feet holding it up. Several shelves displayed what looked to be ancient amulets, each lined with gold and silver symbols, and peppered with rhinestones. There too were, what I hope must be a joke to fit along with the aesthetic of his study, jars of mysterious animal specimens on the higher shelves of the room, floating in murky green and yellow liquid.  




The curiosities were placed carefully between what must have been thousands of books, each one more than likely older than every member of this family combined. Written in some languages that I couldn't read, most without titles, all organized without any sense of organization at all, but somehow the old man knew exactly which one was which, and where it belonged. I walked along the shelves, trying not to make eye contact with any of the jars, my fingers skimming along the old worn edges of the volumes that now had only the purpose of collecting dust. On the bottom two shelves near the end of the row, closest to his desk, were children's books. I got down to the ground and moved old action figures and building blocks off the shelf, my own relics and curiosities. These too had no distinguishable markings or titles, but my hands knew exactly where to go, pulling out a book on fairy tales and magic. I flipped through briefly, skimming handwritten notes on faeries, goblins, trolls, knights and dragons, and magic that went beyond pulling a rabbit from a hat. I ran a finger along the illustration, feeling the pen marks etched into the page as I did. The old man was quite the artist. With a deep long breath, I closed the book once again, sticking it directly into my satchel. I would come back for the rest later.

  
  
An ancient mahogany desk rooted itself in the center of the room, covered in stacks of paper and pencils, unfinished documents, and notes. Vials of black coagulated blood leaned against the wooden rack beside a knocked-over microscope, and a molded slide on the ground underneath. I carefully pulled a few papers from the stack and struggled to read the old man's handwriting. Scribbles about attacking blood cells with silver and killing a virus, harsh notes about running out of time and failing to find a balance between dosages. I set the pages back onto the table and turned my attention to the opposite end of the table. Pushed back against a pile of books at the corner of the table were several small orange empty bottles, similar to the one in my bag. Like fate, my cheap plastic wristwatch beeped to life, reminding me to take the medication. I reached into my bag, pulling out a plastic bottle of water, and the pills, rattling them before twisting the cap and pouring two white and silver capsules into my hand. A sense of inherited anxiety squeezed me as I realized they were the last two. In the rush and stress of coming up the manor, I had forgotten to take more of the medication with me.  




But for what do I feel this anxiety? What am I mending with the capsules? In my almost thirty years of life I never stopped to question what I was putting in my body. As early as my mind could recall, I saw the old man take the medication regularly, along with the rest of the immediate family as well. When I was around five or six I was started on it too. It was one of those rules that a child never questioned, just like washing your hands after the toilet, or saying your please and thank yous. Twice a day, every day, I would have to take two capsules of this medication. When I moved further away the old man mailed me two bottles every single month, and without question, I would take them as I always did. Of course, now another question would be, where would I get more of them? If I ever needed them in the first place. I rolled the two around in my palm for a moment before sliding them back into the bottle and setting it back in my bag. The anxiety in my chest begged for me to take them, and I did my best to drown it with logic in my mind. If there was something wrong with me, a reason I needed to take this medication, clearly all the yearly doctor visits would have picked it up by now. The conference between my fears and my mind settled on them being just vitamins, and we decided as a whole that I could skip taking them for the time being. It's not like I had enough anyway.



  
I sputtered back awake, blood and vomit pooling in my lungs. Bending over, I opened my mouth and let the bile cascade from my stomach, pooling up in a boiling puddle between my feet. In the amalgamation of colors, shapes, and smell I saw specks of shiny white surface and sink. My remaining hand, now also stripped of spots of skin and fingernails, reached into the pool, pulling out the bone fragments. I collected them in my palm, rolling them around with my thumb to rid them of the vomit, only to discover they were teeth. Shocked, I drop them back into the puddle, and reach into my mouth to feel almost nothing except for a few broken stumps and gums. Had I broken them in my attempt to lose consciousness? My thoughts were immediately answered as I felt part of my jaw dislocated, forcing itself to extend past where my chin ended, tearing through the skin of my face. The bone grew upwards, creating a visible cavity where a fang began to sprout, pushing itself forward into the roof of my mouth and scrapping along that part of my skull. It forced its way through with a loud crack and the top of the fang extended through my nose. My brain begins to overload and my vision fades again as I feel the jaw start to achingly pull itself forward along with my extending jaw, breaking and splitting the rest of my face along with it.



  
The amount of food the manor had stocked was greatly exaggerated. The promised year-long supply of food started to dwindle only after the first three weeks. Three weeks was also how long it took for me to finally break through the coded wording of my grandfather's horrible scribbled handwriting. Most of the trinkets were already sorted into piles of 'keep' or 'donate' while the books were in piles of 'legible' and 'eligible.' I doubted the local museums thought my grandfather was important enough to keep his personal notes, research, and journals in their displays or archives. I didn't realize how many of these books he had written himself, and those that weren't authored by him might as well have been, his notes and additions were stuffed inside each page of each book. His choice of subject was cellular science, mixed with his fantasies about folklore and creatures. He combined his knowledge of science and biology and his creativity, creating scientific explanations, equations, and scenarios for various sicknesses and creatures. His research and journals were impressive, his medical biology books, however, were ancient, more than likely outdated. The amount of knowledge he had collected over the last century was unfortunately made absolute by the technology of the past couple of decades. Perhaps a laptop and internet connection might have been a better gift than the several bottles of wine I had gotten him the year previous.



  
In my attempt to clean off a blood slide on the ground I had uncovered a hidden compartment underneath the floorboard. The viscus mix of blood, mold, and whatever else was on that slide refused to give, lifting the entire floorboard instead of peeling off. Underneath was a bundle of journals wrapped in an old torn dress. I collected them into the kitchen and readied myself to try and decipher another round of the old man's scripture, but when I opened the books I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was completely legible. Through a brief skim, I was able to put together another research journal, recording cycles of the moon and their effects on local animal life, each entry signing off with 'M. Lang,' the name belonging to our family. Sprinkled between the notes, drawings, and sketches of wildlife, said mention of a young child and a husband, and the author's desire to protect them from some uncertain disease. Beside these notes stuck a familiar but faded family photo of the three. I stuck the photo in my chest pocket and planned to add the journals to my pile, deciding it might be a fun topic to ask about at the next family reunion when my eyes singled out a few keywords on the final pages of the book. “Do we need to take this medication?” The pages following were torn, with only one more word etched on the back of the leather journal. “hungry.” So was I.

  
  
The promised year's supply of food was now nothing more than a shelf of canned beans, fruits, and sauce. I grab an armful of random cans and make my way back to the kitchen table, emptying the contents into a large bowl, mixing it, and swallowing spoonfuls. My chewing slows, the realization and taste of what I'm stuffing into my mouth finally reaching me, and I vomit back into the bowl. I reach for my glass of water and knock it off the counter, but instead of shattering on the wooden floor, it cracked on top of a pile of garbage. Below my legs are scattered cans, food packaging, spoons, forks, bowls, and knives, some covered in mold. When did I manage to create this mess? I take a moment to take in the sight of the chaos that sat around me before retching once again. But I still hungered. Mindlessly my feet carried me to the cellar meat locker, swinging it open expecting it to be full of hung fresh meat but was only met with one frostbitten, green and gray butchered cow. My nose flared, I could smell the rot from the door, I could still smell the disgusting mess from the kitchen, I could smell the burning wood from the fireplace. Not only was I made aware of the scent of the manor, but I could hear it too, the crackle of each flame as it claimed another piece of wood, the drip from the bathroom faucet, the ache and worry the manor had as it watched me lose my mind. I felt everything come through me, up my shaking legs and through my heavy chest. I felt warm standing in the icy freezer, stripping off my jacket and pants, and tossing them aside. Each step I took into the freezer created steam underneath my bare feet. I felt more and more, and as all the sensations and emotions entered and left my body, one remained. I felt hungry.

  
  
We need to take the medication. My body reacted once again to the icy sting of the freezer floor and my body temperature returned to normal. Scattered beside me were a pile of gnawed bones and spatters of blood. I stomached my vomit this time, refusing to come to terms with what had just happened in the past hour, and instead, I collected my clothing off the frozen ground and made for the old man's study. I searched his desk, emptying every drawer, and clearing every cabinet, but nothing could help my desperate endeavors for relief. The bedroom, every bedroom, was empty, the bathroom medical cabinet had everything except the silver tablets. I took a fire poker from the fireplace and began to tear up every other floorboard in the study, hoping for a secret stash or more hidden research to help calm the pain and hunger steadily building back up in my body. After a bit I tossed the poker aside, ripping through the ground with my own hands became easier and easier. The manor cried to me, begging me to stop, the wood floor ached and screamed with every plank torn, every hole in the wall, every vent pulled from the ceiling, but there was nothing for me to find. I sat defeated on the ground of the destroyed study, absentmindedly clawing away on the ground with one finger. Suddenly my wrist snapped, the carpal bone tearing itself through the surface of my skin. Shock and adrenaline filled my brain and I thought I had hallucinated what I saw next. The bones started to grow and extend before my eyes. Blood vessels and muscle tendons snaked themselves along the white bare bone as red flesh began to pull my arm back together.

  
  
I left everything else but my keys and my wallet, forcing my car back to life in the middle of the snow-blanketed mountain, and made my way back down. I still had the pills in my apartment, at least a month's worth. Now no longer taking his journals as fiction, my grandfather, the great man that he was, did not realize that over time our bloodline, and individual bodies themselves would start to build an immunity to the colloidal silver. The small dosages over the years allowed the virus to form stronger cell walls, and a stronger response over time, just waiting for one of us to forget to take a tablet just one time and then it springs into action. My heightened senses started to return, hearing each gear in my car turn, spark, and crank as it forced its way down the snow-covered mountain. Perhaps he did know. Perhaps the old man did know that eventually the medication would no longer take effect, and eventually his body would too shatter and collapse. I would too, choose a bullet. My focus kept being torn from the road, my ears overloaded with the deafening sound of my car engine, and my eyes were blinded by each individual snowflake that collided with the windshield. Then I heard it. Off in the distance, maybe a half mile away, a stag raised its crowned head to look in my direction, aware of an oncoming predator. Its heartbeat quickened as it tried to judge the distance between us, its warm breath slowed and it lifted a hoof of the ground to prepare to run. Too focused on the animal, I felt my driver-side wheel slide off into a dip along the side of the road. My front wheels jammed and stopped moving, but my back wheels kept pushing, spinning me around, and slamming me against a tree.



  
“Jesus Christ someone wrecked on the road...”



  
The sound of a distant phone call spurred my ears and started to wake me. My remaining human arm was stripped of skin and most of the flesh and muscle underneath. The bones in my forearm had extended to length but the change didn't complete due to my low caloric intake. I hadn't had enough to eat. My legs were in a similar situation, one grown more than the other, bone breaking and poking through the surface, turning me into a malformed pin cushion of a creature. I tried to call out, to call for help but the driver was still a good distance away, and my jaw locked in place, not yet having fully formed into a predatory maw that it was supposed to be. The stranger's car slowed itself on the snow, coming to a crunching stop. He stayed on the phone as he jumped out, calling out to my wreak to check if I was alive. I try to shout back, telling him not to come closer, but my voice comes out in a low growl moan, only making it sound like I desperately need help. I should have stayed silent. The man approached my car and tapped on the cracked stained glass, unable to get a clear look inside. To him, I was an injured driver bent over with my head banged against the steering wheel. I slammed his elbow a few times against the glass but It didn't give, only scratching his arm with loose splintered shards. Blood trickled down his hand and he took a step back to look for a rock or a branch to try and break my window, but he wouldn't need it.



  
My malformed arm smashed through the front windshield, scattering the fragments along the trees and snow. With my stronger arm, I stabbed my claws into the front hood, lifting and pulling myself through the mess of metal and glass, and into the cold winter air. The man rushed to the front of my car to help me, but I raised myself. My shattered skull from my attempt to knock myself out earlier, and the slumped position I jammed my neck in forced the structure to heal incorrectly. Above my malformed fangs, my yellow hateful eyes, sat a branching crown of bones, like fingers reaching towards the clouds. My heart beat painfully in my chest and I looked down to my body to see my open rib cage and stomach, the bones moving in rhythm as my heart raised and fell, trying to keep up with the sudden change of my body size. When I was five foot eleven before now I stood nearing eight or nine feet, my shadow drowning out the light over the screaming stranger before me. Puss, blood, and other liquids dripped from my mouth and open wounds, melting the snow beneath me with every step I took. The stranger's eyes widened in horror as my lungs filled with air, expanding my chest outwards before my jaw snapped open, tearing my mouth down to my neck as I unleashed a deafening roar, sputtering out boiling blood onto to stranger's face, turning his skin to liquid on contact. The man turns to run, but my arm extended by itself, grabbing and shattering his leg. I pulled him into the air and slammed him down against my car shattering the windows and caving in the roof. His screams, now weak and desperate whimpers, the voice on the other side of the phone screaming out his name. Now, at least, I wouldn't be hungry.",1,1742813983.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Been on the lifestyle for two weeks now on a weight loss journey. For reference I’m not trying to heal any ailment and have no food sensitivities.

Its been almost three weeks. In the past I’d been on keto diets and done long fasts so the first 7 days wasn’t a terrible transition and I knew what to expect and the worst of the keto flu/digestive shock is over but unlike when I was on keto, with this carnivore protocol I am constantly fatigued and battling brain fog.

In the first week I was like a walking zombie and would be fighting sleep as soon as I sat on the couch after work.

I make a point of getting 7 hours minimum sleep a night and wake up feeling fresh but by 10am I’m feeling tiredness creep in.

This week has been a fraction better but its still impacting me at my job and even during a light work out at the gym I’m yawning all night and have little focus.

I was wondering if maybe in still in the transition period after three week? Or is there something I need to adjust in my diet? I have no health conditions or food sensitivities for reference 


I eat 2300 calories a day of mince, eggs, bacon and two slices of cheese. For liquids I have some bone broth, mineral water, celtic salt in my drink bottle and one black coffee in the morning, I try to stick to one and never drink it after 5pm as I find it affects going to sleep. 

Other than that its been great, losing weight steadily and safely Ive attached screenshots of my meals and macros in case its any help.

I unfortunately can’t go cold turkey right now. Maybe in a few weekends, but I don’t want to wait that long.  

I’ve had success in the past with using kratom capsules to get off feel free. I have been taking both right now, but only a small amount of capsules. 

Here’s how most days go for me: 

I go to bed saying I’m not going to take feel free tomorrow, wake up super sick (stomach pains, achy, sweaty, restless, snotty, etc) and out of it (hardcore brain fog) around 3am, lay in bed for a bit, get up take 4g of kratom capsules plus some water and coffee, start feeling a bit better. Then a few hours later, I start getting cravings for feel free. Then I either pace around the house like a psycho, or just give in and go buy two bottles. Then two usually turns into 3-4 bottles unless sometimes I just take more kratom capsules instead. 

I’ve been taking 2-4 FF and 4g-10g of kratom for about the last year and a half, with some small breaks occasionally throughout that time. 

If each bottle is actually 3.5grams I’d say I usually range between 15-20grams total per day (ff plus the capsules). 

The best way I’ve been able to combat the cravings is by going on trips out of town or vacation. It blows my mind how your normal day to day routine can keep you stuck in this depressing cycle for sooo long. Sorry for the long post. Just mainly asking for a few things. 

Is my first dose of 4g of powder enough to help me cut out feel free completely? That amount definitely helps, but I usually still feel a bit out of it a few hours later and craving feel free for the solution to that problem. 

Any recommendations on how many capsules per dose and how many doses per day would be greatly appreciated. And if anyone has tips on how to handle the cravings for feel free that would be awesome. 

Thank you!!!

They serve as a refreshing and satisfying way to combat the warm, sun-drenched days, delivering flavors that are often reminiscent of childhood.

The origin of paletas can be traced back to ancient times when indigenous people used local fruits and water to create frozen confections.

Biting down on the seat belt wrapped around my arm and chest, I fight to stay still and conscious. The bones in my left arm shatter under the sheer sudden weight of the growing muscle. Fragments lodge themselves in my flesh and veins, small pieces of white pushing their way to the surface of my skin and breaking through as the dense muscle finds its place to settle. Slowly like magnets, they draw themselves to each other again, tearing their way back underneath as they grow at the same time, connecting and extending my arm an extra foot than it was before. My fingers follow suit, snapping and extending further out. The fingernails rapidly rot and peel off my swollen fingertips as new ones push themselves to the surface, turning into monstrous claws. Gritting my teeth I feel the flesh on my arm burning off, the car seat I was holding onto with my claws melting along with it. With my right hand, I grab whatever molten loose skin still hung and tear it off, letting a patch of dark black hair sprout from the blood underneath. The arm begins to steam as the temperature levels itself out, the transformation coming to a slow, allowing me a moment to breathe and cry. I lean against the door of my car and release the seat belt from my jaw, the taste of metal in my mouth making me gag heavily. With my remaining arm, I try to shove the door open again, but the tree and snow outside refuse to give. I vomit whatever I had left in my stomach, and the blood in my mouth onto my lap as I begin to pass out. At least now I will be warm.

  
  
In search of comfort, my mind automatically drifts to my grandfather. The recently deceased man of six foot five, lived to the ripe age of 110, breaking several records for being the only person on earth to be over a century old and still bench 400. Despite being the absolute tank on legs that he was, the old man spoke with the calming voice of a still ocean. Most of my childhood was under his care after my mother and father had passed from unforeseen circumstances when I was around 3. During the heavy winter snow when family was over, he sang the loudest carols, shaking the entire skeleton of his manor. It was his voice that had brought me into my adulthood, taught me my life lessons, and formed and shaped my morals. The entire mountain mourned the day we discovered his body.

  
  
The man would have lived until 200 if given the chance, but instead, he decided to keep his demons to himself, settling for a bullet to the brain. No matter how much I begged to see his body one more time before they put him to rest, the coroner refused. The funeral and burial were closed casket, and I was left only with memories, and the manor. The hundreds of thousands of books he had collected were all left to me, while it was decided that the rest of the family, oddly accepting of his sudden departure, would split and sell the manor once I was done collecting what I would take with me. I doubted an entire library would fit inside a 2 room New York apartment, so with approved time off from work, I was allowed the winter to spend in the mountain top manor to sort through the books and relics, deciding which would be better suited for a museum, and which would look nice on my cheap IKEA shelf. According to my uncle Calcius, the manor was still well stocked enough to last a man a year if he chose to stay. So in mid-November, I packed my items and made for my childhood home.

  
  
The manor welcomed me back with warm open arms like the old man once did, becoming its own tour guide as I roamed the silent halls that I once ran down. Every time I entered a room or stopped to recall a painting or a decoration, the manor would ask in a calm deep voice, “Hey remember that?” and my smile would respond. “yes, I do.” To fight back the frost growing on the window I turned on the monstrous furnace in the cellar. It woke from its months-long sleep with a mighty roar before the mouth returned to a friendly fiery smile, breathing heat into the rooms and hallways. I was home.

  
  
I woke screaming, feeling my spine pop and force itself to separate. Vertebrae from vertebrae, my skin, and muscle tearing and stretching to try to accommodate the extending bone that was underneath. I writhed, my body still held tight against the car seat by the belt, I lifted my leg and pushed my foot against the dash as my hand searched desperately for a lever under the seat, trying to launch the seat backward and give myself more room. Instead, my shin shatters, my leg snapping downwards and sending a bloody bony stump stabbing into the dash. My eyes blur as I try to focus on the other part of my leg hanging underneath. Muscle and tendons growing rapidly like vines along a white branch, the bone extending fingers trying to interlace back together with my body. My fingers finally find the lever, pull it, and slide my seat back, letting my shin bone slip from the dash and snap back into place with the rest of my leg. The windshield starts to crack, the sudden heat inside the car fighting against the frozen air outside. My neck snaps to one side as my spine keeps rebuilding itself, my shirt and jacket melding together with my discarded skin, a disgusting soup of cloth and flesh. With no other choice, I force myself up and bang my head against the steering wheel as hard as I can. Again, and again, and again, until all my eyes could see was red, and then again.  




Underneath the large main staircase of the manor is a beautiful wood and glass hallway that leads to my grandfather's study. According to my aunt Patricia, the study used to be a rather large sunroom that she used to, as a child, spend summer in, lying on the ground and staring up into the sky watching clouds and birds pass. One summer, when the rest of the family was away, the old man decided to renovate, and by himself, he turned the sunroom into what it is now. The glass dome ceiling remained, now covered for the winter, and the walls of the room were lined with shelves full of books and trinkets. My cousins and I used to call this room the 'Wizard dungeon.' a large golden globe sat near the entrance, larger than a coffee table with wooden lion's feet holding it up. Several shelves displayed what looked to be ancient amulets, each lined with gold and silver symbols, and peppered with rhinestones. There too were, what I hope must be a joke to fit along with the aesthetic of his study, jars of mysterious animal specimens on the higher shelves of the room, floating in murky green and yellow liquid.  




The curiosities were placed carefully between what must have been thousands of books, each one more than likely older than every member of this family combined. Written in some languages that I couldn't read, most without titles, all organized without any sense of organization at all, but somehow the old man knew exactly which one was which, and where it belonged. I walked along the shelves, trying not to make eye contact with any of the jars, my fingers skimming along the old worn edges of the volumes that now had only the purpose of collecting dust. On the bottom two shelves near the end of the row, closest to his desk, were children's books. I got down to the ground and moved old action figures and building blocks off the shelf, my own relics and curiosities. These too had no distinguishable markings or titles, but my hands knew exactly where to go, pulling out a book on fairy tales and magic. I flipped through briefly, skimming handwritten notes on faeries, goblins, trolls, knights and dragons, and magic that went beyond pulling a rabbit from a hat. I ran a finger along the illustration, feeling the pen marks etched into the page as I did. The old man was quite the artist. With a deep long breath, I closed the book once again, sticking it directly into my satchel. I would come back for the rest later.

  
  
An ancient mahogany desk rooted itself in the center of the room, covered in stacks of paper and pencils, unfinished documents, and notes. Vials of black coagulated blood leaned against the wooden rack beside a knocked-over microscope, and a molded slide on the ground underneath. I carefully pulled a few papers from the stack and struggled to read the old man's handwriting. Scribbles about attacking blood cells with silver and killing a virus, harsh notes about running out of time and failing to find a balance between dosages. I set the pages back onto the table and turned my attention to the opposite end of the table. Pushed back against a pile of books at the corner of the table were several small orange empty bottles, similar to the one in my bag. Like fate, my cheap plastic wristwatch beeped to life, reminding me to take the medication. I reached into my bag, pulling out a plastic bottle of water, and the pills, rattling them before twisting the cap and pouring two white and silver capsules into my hand. A sense of inherited anxiety squeezed me as I realized they were the last two. In the rush and stress of coming up the manor, I had forgotten to take more of the medication with me.  




But for what do I feel this anxiety? What am I mending with the capsules? In my almost thirty years of life I never stopped to question what I was putting in my body. As early as my mind could recall, I saw the old man take the medication regularly, along with the rest of the immediate family as well. When I was around five or six I was started on it too. It was one of those rules that a child never questioned, just like washing your hands after the toilet, or saying your please and thank yous. Twice a day, every day, I would have to take two capsules of this medication. When I moved further away the old man mailed me two bottles every single month, and without question, I would take them as I always did. Of course, now another question would be, where would I get more of them? If I ever needed them in the first place. I rolled the two around in my palm for a moment before sliding them back into the bottle and setting it back in my bag. The anxiety in my chest begged for me to take them, and I did my best to drown it with logic in my mind. If there was something wrong with me, a reason I needed to take this medication, clearly all the yearly doctor visits would have picked it up by now. The conference between my fears and my mind settled on them being just vitamins, and we decided as a whole that I could skip taking them for the time being. It's not like I had enough anyway.



  
I sputtered back awake, blood and vomit pooling in my lungs. Bending over, I opened my mouth and let the bile cascade from my stomach, pooling up in a boiling puddle between my feet. In the amalgamation of colors, shapes, and smell I saw specks of shiny white surface and sink. My remaining hand, now also stripped of spots of skin and fingernails, reached into the pool, pulling out the bone fragments. I collected them in my palm, rolling them around with my thumb to rid them of the vomit, only to discover they were teeth. Shocked, I drop them back into the puddle, and reach into my mouth to feel almost nothing except for a few broken stumps and gums. Had I broken them in my attempt to lose consciousness? My thoughts were immediately answered as I felt part of my jaw dislocated, forcing itself to extend past where my chin ended, tearing through the skin of my face. The bone grew upwards, creating a visible cavity where a fang began to sprout, pushing itself forward into the roof of my mouth and scrapping along that part of my skull. It forced its way through with a loud crack and the top of the fang extended through my nose. My brain begins to overload and my vision fades again as I feel the jaw start to achingly pull itself forward along with my extending jaw, breaking and splitting the rest of my face along with it.



  
The amount of food the manor had stocked was greatly exaggerated. The promised year-long supply of food started to dwindle only after the first three weeks. Three weeks was also how long it took for me to finally break through the coded wording of my grandfather's horrible scribbled handwriting. Most of the trinkets were already sorted into piles of 'keep' or 'donate' while the books were in piles of 'legible' and 'eligible.' I doubted the local museums thought my grandfather was important enough to keep his personal notes, research, and journals in their displays or archives. I didn't realize how many of these books he had written himself, and those that weren't authored by him might as well have been, his notes and additions were stuffed inside each page of each book. His choice of subject was cellular science, mixed with his fantasies about folklore and creatures. He combined his knowledge of science and biology and his creativity, creating scientific explanations, equations, and scenarios for various sicknesses and creatures. His research and journals were impressive, his medical biology books, however, were ancient, more than likely outdated. The amount of knowledge he had collected over the last century was unfortunately made absolute by the technology of the past couple of decades. Perhaps a laptop and internet connection might have been a better gift than the several bottles of wine I had gotten him the year previous.



  
In my attempt to clean off a blood slide on the ground I had uncovered a hidden compartment underneath the floorboard. The viscus mix of blood, mold, and whatever else was on that slide refused to give, lifting the entire floorboard instead of peeling off. Underneath was a bundle of journals wrapped in an old torn dress. I collected them into the kitchen and readied myself to try and decipher another round of the old man's scripture, but when I opened the books I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was completely legible. Through a brief skim, I was able to put together another research journal, recording cycles of the moon and their effects on local animal life, each entry signing off with 'M. Lang,' the name belonging to our family. Sprinkled between the notes, drawings, and sketches of wildlife, said mention of a young child and a husband, and the author's desire to protect them from some uncertain disease. Beside these notes stuck a familiar but faded family photo of the three. I stuck the photo in my chest pocket and planned to add the journals to my pile, deciding it might be a fun topic to ask about at the next family reunion when my eyes singled out a few keywords on the final pages of the book. “Do we need to take this medication?” The pages following were torn, with only one more word etched on the back of the leather journal. “hungry.” So was I.

  
  
The promised year's supply of food was now nothing more than a shelf of canned beans, fruits, and sauce. I grab an armful of random cans and make my way back to the kitchen table, emptying the contents into a large bowl, mixing it, and swallowing spoonfuls. My chewing slows, the realization and taste of what I'm stuffing into my mouth finally reaching me, and I vomit back into the bowl. I reach for my glass of water and knock it off the counter, but instead of shattering on the wooden floor, it cracked on top of a pile of garbage. Below my legs are scattered cans, food packaging, spoons, forks, bowls, and knives, some covered in mold. When did I manage to create this mess? I take a moment to take in the sight of the chaos that sat around me before retching once again. But I still hungered. Mindlessly my feet carried me to the cellar meat locker, swinging it open expecting it to be full of hung fresh meat but was only met with one frostbitten, green and gray butchered cow. My nose flared, I could smell the rot from the door, I could still smell the disgusting mess from the kitchen, I could smell the burning wood from the fireplace. Not only was I made aware of the scent of the manor, but I could hear it too, the crackle of each flame as it claimed another piece of wood, the drip from the bathroom faucet, the ache and worry the manor had as it watched me lose my mind. I felt everything come through me, up my shaking legs and through my heavy chest. I felt warm standing in the icy freezer, stripping off my jacket and pants, and tossing them aside. Each step I took into the freezer created steam underneath my bare feet. I felt more and more, and as all the sensations and emotions entered and left my body, one remained. I felt hungry.

  
  
We need to take the medication. My body reacted once again to the icy sting of the freezer floor and my body temperature returned to normal. Scattered beside me were a pile of gnawed bones and spatters of blood. I stomached my vomit this time, refusing to come to terms with what had just happened in the past hour, and instead, I collected my clothing off the frozen ground and made for the old man's study. I searched his desk, emptying every drawer, and clearing every cabinet, but nothing could help my desperate endeavors for relief. The bedroom, every bedroom, was empty, the bathroom medical cabinet had everything except the silver tablets. I took a fire poker from the fireplace and began to tear up every other floorboard in the study, hoping for a secret stash or more hidden research to help calm the pain and hunger steadily building back up in my body. After a bit I tossed the poker aside, ripping through the ground with my own hands became easier and easier. The manor cried to me, begging me to stop, the wood floor ached and screamed with every plank torn, every hole in the wall, every vent pulled from the ceiling, but there was nothing for me to find. I sat defeated on the ground of the destroyed study, absentmindedly clawing away on the ground with one finger. Suddenly my wrist snapped, the carpal bone tearing itself through the surface of my skin. Shock and adrenaline filled my brain and I thought I had hallucinated what I saw next. The bones started to grow and extend before my eyes. Blood vessels and muscle tendons snaked themselves along the white bare bone as red flesh began to pull my arm back together.

  
  
I left everything else but my keys and my wallet, forcing my car back to life in the middle of the snow-blanketed mountain, and made my way back down. I still had the pills in my apartment, at least a month's worth. Now no longer taking his journals as fiction, my grandfather, the great man that he was, did not realize that over time our bloodline, and individual bodies themselves would start to build an immunity to the colloidal silver. The small dosages over the years allowed the virus to form stronger cell walls, and a stronger response over time, just waiting for one of us to forget to take a tablet just one time and then it springs into action. My heightened senses started to return, hearing each gear in my car turn, spark, and crank as it forced its way down the snow-covered mountain. Perhaps he did know. Perhaps the old man did know that eventually the medication would no longer take effect, and eventually his body would too shatter and collapse. I would too, choose a bullet. My focus kept being torn from the road, my ears overloaded with the deafening sound of my car engine, and my eyes were blinded by each individual snowflake that collided with the windshield. Then I heard it. Off in the distance, maybe a half mile away, a stag raised its crowned head to look in my direction, aware of an oncoming predator. Its heartbeat quickened as it tried to judge the distance between us, its warm breath slowed and it lifted a hoof of the ground to prepare to run. Too focused on the animal, I felt my driver-side wheel slide off into a dip along the side of the road. My front wheels jammed and stopped moving, but my back wheels kept pushing, spinning me around, and slamming me against a tree.



  
“Jesus Christ someone wrecked on the road...”



  
The sound of a distant phone call spurred my ears and started to wake me. My remaining human arm was stripped of skin and most of the flesh and muscle underneath. The bones in my forearm had extended to length but the change didn't complete due to my low caloric intake. I hadn't had enough to eat. My legs were in a similar situation, one grown more than the other, bone breaking and poking through the surface, turning me into a malformed pin cushion of a creature. I tried to call out, to call for help but the driver was still a good distance away, and my jaw locked in place, not yet having fully formed into a predatory maw that it was supposed to be. The stranger's car slowed itself on the snow, coming to a crunching stop. He stayed on the phone as he jumped out, calling out to my wreak to check if I was alive. I try to shout back, telling him not to come closer, but my voice comes out in a low growl moan, only making it sound like I desperately need help. I should have stayed silent. The man approached my car and tapped on the cracked stained glass, unable to get a clear look inside. To him, I was an injured driver bent over with my head banged against the steering wheel. I slammed his elbow a few times against the glass but It didn't give, only scratching his arm with loose splintered shards. Blood trickled down his hand and he took a step back to look for a rock or a branch to try and break my window, but he wouldn't need it.



  
My malformed arm smashed through the front windshield, scattering the fragments along the trees and snow. With my stronger arm, I stabbed my claws into the front hood, lifting and pulling myself through the mess of metal and glass, and into the cold winter air. The man rushed to the front of my car to help me, but I raised myself. My shattered skull from my attempt to knock myself out earlier, and the slumped position I jammed my neck in forced the structure to heal incorrectly. Above my malformed fangs, my yellow hateful eyes, sat a branching crown of bones, like fingers reaching towards the clouds. My heart beat painfully in my chest and I looked down to my body to see my open rib cage and stomach, the bones moving in rhythm as my heart raised and fell, trying to keep up with the sudden change of my body size. When I was five foot eleven before now I stood nearing eight or nine feet, my shadow drowning out the light over the screaming stranger before me. Puss, blood, and other liquids dripped from my mouth and open wounds, melting the snow beneath me with every step I took. The stranger's eyes widened in horror as my lungs filled with air, expanding my chest outwards before my jaw snapped open, tearing my mouth down to my neck as I unleashed a deafening roar, sputtering out boiling blood onto to stranger's face, turning his skin to liquid on contact. The man turns to run, but my arm extended by itself, grabbing and shattering his leg. I pulled him into the air and slammed him down against my car shattering the windows and caving in the roof. His screams, now weak and desperate whimpers, the voice on the other side of the phone screaming out his name. Now, at least, I wouldn't be hungry.",3,1742813314.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I would also appreciate better programming logic to prevent the steam pressure from diving to almost 0.5 bar while steaming once every 10 or so times.

1jinroj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1jinroj/just_another_quiet_day_in_pattaya/,Just Another Quiet Day in Pattaya…,"we arrived. Pattaya. First impressions? It’s like someone took Las Vegas, threw in a beach, added a few confused retirees, and said, “Here, enjoy.”

The first thing that hit me? The heat. It wasn’t just hot, it was personal. The sun in Pattaya doesn’t just shine, it follows you like it has unfinished business.

Checked into my Airbnb, expecting a sleek getaway. Reality? A room that looked like the pictures were taken during its golden era, twenty renovations ago. But the host greeted me like I was family, and suddenly, I felt too guilty to complain. Hospitality so strong, it gaslit me into loving the place. 

Took a boat to Coral Island, dreaming of paradise. Instead, I arrived at a sunscreen scented battlefield of tourists, jet skis, and selfie sticks. The water was gorgeous, when you could see it between a hundred splashing feet. Tried snorkeling, but the fish looked at me like I owed them rent. Still, the seafood was fresh, the sun was hot, and I left with a tan that screamed, “I underestimated Thailand’s UV rays.” 

After that, I went to The Sanctuary of Truth, thinking it would be a quick temple visit. What I found was a giant wooden cathedral built by a philosopher with too much free time and an unlimited lumber budget. Every inch was carved with stories of life, death, and probably a few things lost in translation.""

After lunch, I went to Pattaya Floating Market, hoping for a peaceful boat ride. Instead, I got ambushed by souvenir sellers, nearly adopted by a coconut vendor, and left with a hat I didn’t need but was too polite to refuse.

I went back to the beach to sit and relax. I found a quiet spot, but the water had a color that made me wonder if Mother Nature accidentally spilled her morning coffee in it.

Walking Street at night was like a buffet where the food chooses you. Neon lights flickered, music blasted from every bar, and night shift romantics stood in formation like they were waiting for a job interview with the interview happening right there on the sidewalk.

Some girls leaned on bar stools, giving ""come here"" looks to anyone with a heartbeat and a wallet. Others pretended to check their phones, as if their long-lost billionaire boyfriend might suddenly text back. Meanwhile, the customers came in all types: some confused, some confident, and some already deep in negotiations like they were closing a business deal with a limited-time offer.

A few guys walked past, pretending they weren’t interested, only to return five minutes later, holding hands with their new ""soulmate."" Others skipped the process altogether, strolling out of bars with beers in one hand and a rental girlfriend in the other, as if they were part of some all inclusive package deal.

Pattaya was wild, hot, and full of surprises. It’s a place you won’t forget, whether you love it or not

1jinr54,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jinr54/silver/,Silver,"Biting down on the seat belt wrapped around my arm and chest, I fight to stay still and conscious. The bones in my left arm shatter under the sheer sudden weight of the growing muscle. Fragments lodge themselves in my flesh and veins, small pieces of white pushing their way to the surface of my skin and breaking through as the dense muscle finds its place to settle. Slowly like magnets, they draw themselves to each other again, tearing their way back underneath as they grow at the same time, connecting and extending my arm an extra foot than it was before. My fingers follow suit, snapping and extending further out. The fingernails rapidly rot and peel off my swollen fingertips as new ones push themselves to the surface, turning into monstrous claws. Gritting my teeth I feel the flesh on my arm burning off, the car seat I was holding onto with my claws melting along with it. With my right hand, I grab whatever molten loose skin still hung and tear it off, letting a patch of dark black hair sprout from the blood underneath. The arm begins to steam as the temperature levels itself out, the transformation coming to a slow, allowing me a moment to breathe and cry. I lean against the door of my car and release the seat belt from my jaw, the taste of metal in my mouth making me gag heavily. With my remaining arm, I try to shove the door open again, but the tree and snow outside refuse to give. I vomit whatever I had left in my stomach, and the blood in my mouth onto my lap as I begin to pass out. At least now I will be warm.

  
  
In search of comfort, my mind automatically drifts to my grandfather. The recently deceased man of six foot five, lived to the ripe age of 110, breaking several records for being the only person on earth to be over a century old and still bench 400. Despite being the absolute tank on legs that he was, the old man spoke with the calming voice of a still ocean. Most of my childhood was under his care after my mother and father had passed from unforeseen circumstances when I was around 3. During the heavy winter snow when family was over, he sang the loudest carols, shaking the entire skeleton of his manor. It was his voice that had brought me into my adulthood, taught me my life lessons, and formed and shaped my morals. The entire mountain mourned the day we discovered his body.

  
  
The man would have lived until 200 if given the chance, but instead, he decided to keep his demons to himself, settling for a bullet to the brain. No matter how much I begged to see his body one more time before they put him to rest, the coroner refused. The funeral and burial were closed casket, and I was left only with memories, and the manor. The hundreds of thousands of books he had collected were all left to me, while it was decided that the rest of the family, oddly accepting of his sudden departure, would split and sell the manor once I was done collecting what I would take with me. I doubted an entire library would fit inside a 2 room New York apartment, so with approved time off from work, I was allowed the winter to spend in the mountain top manor to sort through the books and relics, deciding which would be better suited for a museum, and which would look nice on my cheap IKEA shelf. According to my uncle Calcius, the manor was still well stocked enough to last a man a year if he chose to stay. So in mid-November, I packed my items and made for my childhood home.

  
  
The manor welcomed me back with warm open arms like the old man once did, becoming its own tour guide as I roamed the silent halls that I once ran down. Every time I entered a room or stopped to recall a painting or a decoration, the manor would ask in a calm deep voice, “Hey remember that?” and my smile would respond. “yes, I do.” To fight back the frost growing on the window I turned on the monstrous furnace in the cellar. It woke from its months-long sleep with a mighty roar before the mouth returned to a friendly fiery smile, breathing heat into the rooms and hallways. I was home.

  
  
I woke screaming, feeling my spine pop and force itself to separate. Vertebrae from vertebrae, my skin, and muscle tearing and stretching to try to accommodate the extending bone that was underneath. I writhed, my body still held tight against the car seat by the belt, I lifted my leg and pushed my foot against the dash as my hand searched desperately for a lever under the seat, trying to launch the seat backward and give myself more room. Instead, my shin shatters, my leg snapping downwards and sending a bloody bony stump stabbing into the dash. My eyes blur as I try to focus on the other part of my leg hanging underneath. Muscle and tendons growing rapidly like vines along a white branch, the bone extending fingers trying to interlace back together with my body. My fingers finally find the lever, pull it, and slide my seat back, letting my shin bone slip from the dash and snap back into place with the rest of my leg. The windshield starts to crack, the sudden heat inside the car fighting against the frozen air outside. My neck snaps to one side as my spine keeps rebuilding itself, my shirt and jacket melding together with my discarded skin, a disgusting soup of cloth and flesh. With no other choice, I force myself up and bang my head against the steering wheel as hard as I can. Again, and again, and again, until all my eyes could see was red, and then again.  




Underneath the large main staircase of the manor is a beautiful wood and glass hallway that leads to my grandfather's study. According to my aunt Patricia, the study used to be a rather large sunroom that she used to, as a child, spend summer in, lying on the ground and staring up into the sky watching clouds and birds pass. One summer, when the rest of the family was away, the old man decided to renovate, and by himself, he turned the sunroom into what it is now. The glass dome ceiling remained, now covered for the winter, and the walls of the room were lined with shelves full of books and trinkets. My cousins and I used to call this room the 'Wizard dungeon.' a large golden globe sat near the entrance, larger than a coffee table with wooden lion's feet holding it up. Several shelves displayed what looked to be ancient amulets, each lined with gold and silver symbols, and peppered with rhinestones. There too were, what I hope must be a joke to fit along with the aesthetic of his study, jars of mysterious animal specimens on the higher shelves of the room, floating in murky green and yellow liquid.  




The curiosities were placed carefully between what must have been thousands of books, each one more than likely older than every member of this family combined. Written in some languages that I couldn't read, most without titles, all organized without any sense of organization at all, but somehow the old man knew exactly which one was which, and where it belonged. I walked along the shelves, trying not to make eye contact with any of the jars, my fingers skimming along the old worn edges of the volumes that now had only the purpose of collecting dust. On the bottom two shelves near the end of the row, closest to his desk, were children's books. I got down to the ground and moved old action figures and building blocks off the shelf, my own relics and curiosities. These too had no distinguishable markings or titles, but my hands knew exactly where to go, pulling out a book on fairy tales and magic. I flipped through briefly, skimming handwritten notes on faeries, goblins, trolls, knights and dragons, and magic that went beyond pulling a rabbit from a hat. I ran a finger along the illustration, feeling the pen marks etched into the page as I did. The old man was quite the artist. With a deep long breath, I closed the book once again, sticking it directly into my satchel. I would come back for the rest later.

  
  
An ancient mahogany desk rooted itself in the center of the room, covered in stacks of paper and pencils, unfinished documents, and notes. Vials of black coagulated blood leaned against the wooden rack beside a knocked-over microscope, and a molded slide on the ground underneath. I carefully pulled a few papers from the stack and struggled to read the old man's handwriting. Scribbles about attacking blood cells with silver and killing a virus, harsh notes about running out of time and failing to find a balance between dosages. I set the pages back onto the table and turned my attention to the opposite end of the table. Pushed back against a pile of books at the corner of the table were several small orange empty bottles, similar to the one in my bag. Like fate, my cheap plastic wristwatch beeped to life, reminding me to take the medication. I reached into my bag, pulling out a plastic bottle of water, and the pills, rattling them before twisting the cap and pouring two white and silver capsules into my hand. A sense of inherited anxiety squeezed me as I realized they were the last two. In the rush and stress of coming up the manor, I had forgotten to take more of the medication with me.  




But for what do I feel this anxiety? What am I mending with the capsules? In my almost thirty years of life I never stopped to question what I was putting in my body. As early as my mind could recall, I saw the old man take the medication regularly, along with the rest of the immediate family as well. When I was around five or six I was started on it too. It was one of those rules that a child never questioned, just like washing your hands after the toilet, or saying your please and thank yous. Twice a day, every day, I would have to take two capsules of this medication. When I moved further away the old man mailed me two bottles every single month, and without question, I would take them as I always did. Of course, now another question would be, where would I get more of them? If I ever needed them in the first place. I rolled the two around in my palm for a moment before sliding them back into the bottle and setting it back in my bag. The anxiety in my chest begged for me to take them, and I did my best to drown it with logic in my mind. If there was something wrong with me, a reason I needed to take this medication, clearly all the yearly doctor visits would have picked it up by now. The conference between my fears and my mind settled on them being just vitamins, and we decided as a whole that I could skip taking them for the time being. It's not like I had enough anyway.



  
I sputtered back awake, blood and vomit pooling in my lungs. Bending over, I opened my mouth and let the bile cascade from my stomach, pooling up in a boiling puddle between my feet. In the amalgamation of colors, shapes, and smell I saw specks of shiny white surface and sink. My remaining hand, now also stripped of spots of skin and fingernails, reached into the pool, pulling out the bone fragments. I collected them in my palm, rolling them around with my thumb to rid them of the vomit, only to discover they were teeth. Shocked, I drop them back into the puddle, and reach into my mouth to feel almost nothing except for a few broken stumps and gums. Had I broken them in my attempt to lose consciousness? My thoughts were immediately answered as I felt part of my jaw dislocated, forcing itself to extend past where my chin ended, tearing through the skin of my face. The bone grew upwards, creating a visible cavity where a fang began to sprout, pushing itself forward into the roof of my mouth and scrapping along that part of my skull. It forced its way through with a loud crack and the top of the fang extended through my nose. My brain begins to overload and my vision fades again as I feel the jaw start to achingly pull itself forward along with my extending jaw, breaking and splitting the rest of my face along with it.

I didn't realize how many of these books he had written himself, and those that weren't authored by him might as well have been, his notes and additions were stuffed inside each page of each book. His choice of subject was cellular science, mixed with his fantasies about folklore and creatures. He combined his knowledge of science and biology and his creativity, creating scientific explanations, equations, and scenarios for various sicknesses and creatures. His research and journals were impressive, his medical biology books, however, were ancient, more than likely outdated. The amount of knowledge he had collected over the last century was unfortunately made absolute by the technology of the past couple of decades. Perhaps a laptop and internet connection might have been a better gift than the several bottles of wine I had gotten him the year previous.



  
In my attempt to clean off a blood slide on the ground I had uncovered a hidden compartment underneath the floorboard. The viscus mix of blood, mold, and whatever else was on that slide refused to give, lifting the entire floorboard instead of peeling off. Underneath was a bundle of journals wrapped in an old torn dress. I collected them into the kitchen and readied myself to try and decipher another round of the old man's scripture, but when I opened the books I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was completely legible. Through a brief skim, I was able to put together another research journal, recording cycles of the moon and their effects on local animal life, each entry signing off with 'M. Lang,' the name belonging to our family. Sprinkled between the notes, drawings, and sketches of wildlife, said mention of a young child and a husband, and the author's desire to protect them from some uncertain disease. Beside these notes stuck a familiar but faded family photo of the three. I stuck the photo in my chest pocket and planned to add the journals to my pile, deciding it might be a fun topic to ask about at the next family reunion when my eyes singled out a few keywords on the final pages of the book. “Do we need to take this medication?” The pages following were torn, with only one more word etched on the back of the leather journal. “hungry.” So was I.

I reach for my glass of water and knock it off the counter, but instead of shattering on the wooden floor, it cracked on top of a pile of garbage. Below my legs are scattered cans, food packaging, spoons, forks, bowls, and knives, some covered in mold. When did I manage to create this mess? I take a moment to take in the sight of the chaos that sat around me before retching once again. But I still hungered. Mindlessly my feet carried me to the cellar meat locker, swinging it open expecting it to be full of hung fresh meat but was only met with one frostbitten, green and gray butchered cow.

Now no longer taking his journals as fiction, my grandfather, the great man that he was, did not realize that over time our bloodline, and individual bodies themselves would start to build an immunity to the colloidal silver. The small dosages over the years allowed the virus to form stronger cell walls, and a stronger response over time, just waiting for one of us to forget to take a tablet just one time and then it springs into action. My heightened senses started to return, hearing each gear in my car turn, spark, and crank as it forced its way down the snow-covered mountain. Perhaps he did know. Perhaps the old man did know that eventually the medication would no longer take effect, and eventually his body would too shatter and collapse. I would too, choose a bullet. My focus kept being torn from the road, my ears overloaded with the deafening sound of my car engine, and my eyes were blinded by each individual snowflake that collided with the windshield. Then I heard it. Off in the distance, maybe a half mile away, a stag raised its crowned head to look in my direction, aware of an oncoming predator. Its heartbeat quickened as it tried to judge the distance between us, its warm breath slowed and it lifted a hoof of the ground to prepare to run. Too focused on the animal, I felt my driver-side wheel slide off into a dip along the side of the road. My front wheels jammed and stopped moving, but my back wheels kept pushing, spinning me around, and slamming me against a tree.



  
“Jesus Christ someone wrecked on the road...”



  
The sound of a distant phone call spurred my ears and started to wake me. My remaining human arm was stripped of skin and most of the flesh and muscle underneath. The bones in my forearm had extended to length but the change didn't complete due to my low caloric intake. I hadn't had enough to eat. My legs were in a similar situation, one grown more than the other, bone breaking and poking through the surface, turning me into a malformed pin cushion of a creature. I tried to call out, to call for help but the driver was still a good distance away, and my jaw locked in place, not yet having fully formed into a predatory maw that it was supposed to be. The stranger's car slowed itself on the snow, coming to a crunching stop. He stayed on the phone as he jumped out, calling out to my wreak to check if I was alive. I try to shout back, telling him not to come closer, but my voice comes out in a low growl moan, only making it sound like I desperately need help. I should have stayed silent. The man approached my car and tapped on the cracked stained glass, unable to get a clear look inside. To him, I was an injured driver bent over with my head banged against the steering wheel. I slammed his elbow a few times against the glass but It didn't give, only scratching his arm with loose splintered shards. Blood trickled down his hand and he took a step back to look for a rock or a branch to try and break my window, but he wouldn't need it.



  
My malformed arm smashed through the front windshield, scattering the fragments along the trees and snow. With my stronger arm, I stabbed my claws into the front hood, lifting and pulling myself through the mess of metal and glass, and into the cold winter air. The man rushed to the front of my car to help me, but I raised myself. My shattered skull from my attempt to knock myself out earlier, and the slumped position I jammed my neck in forced the structure to heal incorrectly. Above my malformed fangs, my yellow hateful eyes, sat a branching crown of bones, like fingers reaching towards the clouds. My heart beat painfully in my chest and I looked down to my body to see my open rib cage and stomach, the bones moving in rhythm as my heart raised and fell, trying to keep up with the sudden change of my body size. When I was five foot eleven before now I stood nearing eight or nine feet, my shadow drowning out the light over the screaming stranger before me. Puss, blood, and other liquids dripped from my mouth and open wounds, melting the snow beneath me with every step I took. The stranger's eyes widened in horror as my lungs filled with air, expanding my chest outwards before my jaw snapped open, tearing my mouth down to my neck as I unleashed a deafening roar, sputtering out boiling blood onto to stranger's face, turning his skin to liquid on contact. The man turns to run, but my arm extended by itself, grabbing and shattering his leg. I pulled him into the air and slammed him down against my car shattering the windows and caving in the roof. His screams, now weak and desperate whimpers, the voice on the other side of the phone screaming out his name. Now, at least, I wouldn't be hungry.",2,1742813205.0,scarystories,2,1.0,False

1jinoke,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jinoke/racing_the_sun/,Racing the Sun,"Names matter. Give a planet a name like ""Earth"", or ""Gallonigher"", or even ""Badlanding"", and you know it's a place with something special. Not necessarily a good place, but a place worth remembering. When it's has a name like ""LQA-41-40-386"", that's another thing entirely. People don't dream of starting a new life on a planet named by someone's cat walking across the keyboard. Those places, if there are people there at all, are job worlds - you come, you do some thankless task, and then you leave for better, brighter worlds.

Needless to say, people get bored when living off the map, and as long as the bulk haulers leave fat and full nobody really looks too closely at what you get up to.

That means you can do things you probably ought not to do.

That means you can race the sun.

Mining worlds build roads. It's ultimately a lot easier to move things across the surface of a planet than under it, or over it. The atmosphere is so thin it might as well not exist, so once things are built they stay built. Sweep the roads and the surrounding area thoroughly enough and you'll never need to worry about anything other than apocalyptic temperature changes caused by the lazy rotation of the world. Mining is an ofshoot of engineering, and engineers are usually, for the most part, incredibly boring people. Artists would create roads that swoop and soar about the landscape, following the natural contours of the world. Engineers draw a straight line between two points.

The distance between Access Point Two of minehead Kappa-Beta, and Access Point Six of processing station Theta-Theta is forty miles, give or take a few inches. The solar terminator takes precisely four minutes to travel that distance. The road between these two stations runs perfectly perpendicular to the sun.

Even God fears a bored engineer.

The road was clear. Officially, this sort of behaviour was absolutely prohibited, but for the next four minutes a lot of security personnel would be on a coffee break, and it'd all be over by the time they got back on shift. At the base of the exit ramp the runner purred to itself, engines ticking over, sending trembles through the lightweight frame. The comically oversized tyres squeaked in anticipation. Gregory mounted the insectoid machine, careful not to stand on any of the many, many hazard-striped sections as he eased himself into the cramped little cockpit.

""This is Express Delivery to Kappa-Beta Control, requesting permission to leave.""

""*Stanby.*"" The voice came back. ""*Traffic is clear, conditions are good. Don't exceed ramp speed on the way out.*""

Gregory smiled to himself. ""What time is sunrise, Control?""

The answer was a subtle snort of nasal exhalation. ""*Sunrise is at 07:15 local time, which is in t-minus five seconds. Four. Three. Two. One. Sunrise!*""

With a hard thunk, Gregory buried his foot into the floor. The machine lurched, tyres squealing, and then surged forward under the power of its auxiliary batteries. It felt painfully slow, but that was fine; he'd feel the speed soon enough. Up the ramp and through the doors, out into a blinding world; ""Le quai"", as the locals dubbed it, was a world torn between two extremes of freezing night and scorching day. The dull grey rock was already turning a rustic red; midday temperatures could rise as high as two hundred celsius. Needless to say, you'd need more than sunscreen. Express Delivery had no windows, but the effect was recreated via cameras and cockpit screens; the Kappa-Beta minehead was an ugly grey box on a boring grey plain, with nothing resembling geography within ten miles. Gregory was doing seventy miles per hour when he left the minehead. The sun was doing six hundred.

With the press of a big red button, all that began to change.

The G-force was staggering. Twin tongues of white-hot plasma fire erupted from the boosters mounted above and behind the cockpit, blasting the machine forward. The only reason he didn't rocket off into the sky was the world's lack of atmosphere; there was nothing to provide up-lift. Even so, six attitude thrusters were mounted at key points on the hull of Express Delivery to provide a little more downforce, enough to keep the tyres kissing tarmac. Enough that, by the strictest definition, he could be said to be a road vehicle.

Crushed into his seat, Gregory saw the first markers roaring into view. Jagged, broken pillars of crust loomed ahead like the teeth of a chthonic beast, tossed there aeons ago by a formative planetary collision. They shone a devilish amber. If there had been any oxygen they'd have danced in the heat haze. Instead, they merely loomed, watching, their pocked, irregular forms poised like carrion feeders to devour whatever drew near. The road cared not, and ploughed straight through them. Their prey went by at four hundred and sixteen miles per hour, much too fast for such lethargic hunters to catch.

The road branched now. The main thoroughfare was still four lanes wide, and broad lanes at that, enough to handle even the most colossal bulk conveyor. The exit ramp was likewise vast and spent a leisurely quarter-mile to loop around and under the main road. Tunnels were always preferable to bridges in this environment. That would ultimately take a traveller to Alpha Complex. The markers for the exit were placed one mile before the junction. To the naked eye they were merely alabaster obelisks, but onboard nagivation systems displayed virtual signposts to guide those inclined to drive manually. Gregory shrieked past them, and six seconds later, the junction itself.

Now the Long Tunnel lay ahead. Blissfully dark, stygian cold. Amber running lights in the ceiling blurred together, becoming streaks of background glow as he rapidly approached what was colloquially still called ""the sound barrier"". The actual speed at which vibrations moved through a medium varied by said medium, and there was certainly no air for sound to propagate through on Le quai, but the term had stuck around. About seven hundred and sixty-seven miles per hour. He broke that in the Long Tunnel. He broke it by a lot.

Then out, into the open sky, into Theta Site. A crater twenty miles wide yawned out before him, vast and deep, no doubt the cataclysm that had produced the spires and caused an interesting geological mixup worthy of a research camp. Said camp, Theta-Epsilon, was four hundred metres below Gregory's vehicle. The road cared not; engineers had simply built a bridge across the span. The official reasons were a mix of transport logistics and preserving the crater site for the benefit of scientific research. In reality, someone had just wanted to build a big bridge.

Initially, Gregory had no clear view of the structure. He was sun-blind coming out of the tunnel. Then he saw it, first by the winking red and green lights along its support struts, and the familiar amber of traffic lighting. The rest of the span was dark as the interplanetary void. He risked a glance at his rear camera, and there it was; the wall of light, the fierce transition between frozen night and boiling day. It was behind him, and falling fast.

That was no reason to celebrate. Winning the race was easy - winning and living to tell of it? That was another matter. Unlike the Sun, which could maintain a constant speed, Gregory had to slow down eventually. He'd need at least ten miles to get down to anything resembling a sane speed. Delay braking by even a fraction of a second and he'd slam into the back wall of Theta-Theta-One's parking bay at bone-shattering speed. Delay by two fractions and there'd be nothing to bury - they'd just wash him off the wall with a power hose.

One foot on the accelerator, the other on the brake. The far wall of the grand crater was coming up at a truly alarming rate. Gregory saw the next tunnel, waited half a heartbeat, then stamped his foot on the brake pedal as hard as he could. In the time it took his eyes to recognise the opening and his foot to obey he'd entered the tunnel. The way ahead was alight with retrothrust. The hard-Gs threatened to rip him from his seat. The safety harness dug painfully into his ribs despite the padding.

Theta-Theta-One was ahead, doors wide open and waiting. Three hundred miles per hour felt sluggish as he made the final approach. The central hub was a grand tower, a dull-metal cylinder with widened segments at one-third and two-thirds of its height. It wore a crown of communication antennae and sported parabolic transmittors for ears. Peeking over its shoulder were the solar panels of the Theta Arcology, where thirty thousand workers lived. Most people lived deep underground, but that silvery bulb had been a pre-fab model, dropped from orbit two years ago. It was widely lambasted for failing to adhere to the mining world's rustic aesthetic.

He passed the outer boundary markers at two hundred miles per hour. Behind him, the crater wall was haloed by an angelic glow as the sun's rays crested its highest peaks. It began to glow, first brown, then red, shifting in shade each time Gregory dared to glance at his rearward cameras. The sun was closing fast. It devoured the empty surface yards, it blazed through the to-be-started construction lots without regard for the no trespassing signage. It came through the outer boundary and made straight for the terminal with absolutely no regard for local speed limits.

""Express Delivery to Theta-Theta Control, better prep the crash nets!""

A good engineer always allowed room for error. The signage said the entry ramp was a hard 40 limit, but the ramp itself had been built to safely allow all but the largest vehicles to take it at 60. Gregory hit the lip at double the posted limit. His tyres left the road, and his stomach lurched as he wondered if he'd slam straight into the ceiling. A panicked burst of the down-thruters got him back to ground with a protesting shriek of rubber, and despite the danger he risked another quick burst of the retro-thrusters. Express Delivery began to fishtail, coming to the bottom of the ramp moving at a relatively sedate thirty-five miles per hour. It was moving sideways at that point. The long, dirty streaks of molten rubber wove a fanciful dance across the parking bay floor as the vehicle span around and around, before friction finally got its way and brought the whole contraption to a sharp, jolting stop. He was two inches from the far wall.

All that Gregory could hear was the deafening thump of his own heartbeat. That meant he was alive at least, which was a good sign. Next came the clink and clank of cooling metal. Something trickled into his eye, making him rip his crash helmet off in a panic. Expecting blood, he instead found sweat. Only now did he realise the inside of his vehicle was sauna hot - Express One sacrificed air conditioning in pursuit of raw speed.

""*Control to Express One. Still alive in there?*""

""Just about.""

""*Good to hear. We've logged you in, by the way. Arrival time is 07:18.993 - just before sunrise!*""

Gregory let out the breath he didn't realise he'd been holding. He felt dizzy. He felt sick. He felt ready to go again. ""Best commute in the galaxy!""",7,1742812904.0,HFY,3,0.82,False
1jinoeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breeze_MentalHealth/comments/1jinoeg/how_breeze_app_mental_health_helped_me_deal_with/,How Breeze App (mental health) Helped Me Deal with Anxiety,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share a little personal story in case it helps someone else who’s been dealing with anxiety like I have.

I’ve struggled with anxiety on and off for most of my adult life. Not always the panic attack kind (though I’ve had those too), but that constant background noise of worry, overthinking, tension in the chest, racing thoughts — especially at night. If you know, you know.

I’ve tried a bunch of things over the years. Therapy (still doing it), meditation, breathing exercises, and of course, my endless hunt for “the right app” that could help me stay on track. Most apps I’ve tried either felt too complicated or too gamified. I’d use them for a week, maybe two, and then forget about them entirely.

Then, about six months ago, I came across [Breeze App](https://breeze-wellbeing.com/) — just randomly scrolling the app store. The design looked clean, reviews were solid.

And honestly? It stuck. More than anything else I’ve tried on my phone, this one became part of my actual routine.

# What I Use in the App

I mostly use four features: **Gratitude journaling, Mood Tracker, Mindful Breathing, and the “Let Go of Stress” journaling prompt**. They’re simple, but they work well together.

* **Gratitude practice** might seem kind of cheesy at first, but I swear it shifted my mindset. When you take a moment to reflect on something positive, even if it’s tiny (like ""I had good coffee"" or ""my friend texted me back""), it helps rewire your brain to look for the good more often. I do this most mornings now, and I think it’s made me less reactive and more balanced emotionally.
* **Mood Tracker** is a great check-in tool. I use it once a day, usually at night. Being able to see my emotional patterns helps me connect dots I wouldn’t otherwise notice—like how lack of sleep messes with me more than I thought, or how even short walks boost my mood.
* **Mindful Breathing** is my go-to during high-stress moments. It’s not fancy, just well-paced breathing exercises with a calming visual. If I feel overwhelmed, I’ll pop into this part of the app for five minutes, and I *always* feel a bit more grounded afterward.
* The **Let Go of Stress journaling** is what surprised me the most. It’s like a self-guided brain dump. You write out what’s bothering you, and the prompts help you untangle it and see it from a different angle. I don’t write essays—sometimes just a few sentences—but it really helps to externalize thoughts.

# Why It Actually Helped My Anxiety

There’s something psychologically sound about the way Breeze is structured. It doesn’t try to fix you, but instead gives you tools to help you *understand* what’s going on inside. That in itself reduces anxiety, at least for me.

Here’s what I’ve learned from doing a bit of reading and talking to my therapist:

* **Labeling emotions** (like in the mood tracker) actually reduces their intensity.
* **Breathwork** activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps calm the body’s stress response.
* **Gratitude** increases dopamine and serotonin, which boost mood and resilience.
* **Expressive journaling** gives your brain a chance to process thoughts, instead of letting them swirl around unspoken.

None of this is magic, but doing these things *consistently* adds up. That’s the key — consistency. Breeze made it easy to build those small habits without pressure.

I’m not saying Breeze is a cure for anxiety — it’s not. Mental health is complex, and for some people, apps like this might not be enough on their own. But for me, it became a valuable support tool alongside therapy and lifestyle changes.

It’s non-judgmental, easy to use, and feels like a quiet nudge toward better mental habits. No pop-ups, no “motivational quotes shouting at you” energy. Just small, steady practices that bring you back to yourself.

If you’re someone who deals with anxiety and wants something simple to help you stay grounded, I really recommend giving Breeze a try. No app is perfect, but this one actually helped me feel a little more in control — and that’s something I didn’t expect from a random download on a Tuesday afternoon.
