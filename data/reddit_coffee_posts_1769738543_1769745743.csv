This is Rita!! She’s a paranormal investigator/cryptozoologist who has interacted with her fair share of monsters, most of whom didn't have her best interest in mind. As a result, she's pretty spooked by them!! But she's willing to conquer her fear by going out with your oc! she is DEFINITELY NOT SCARED and it WILL go well....

(provided they don't try to kill her because she asked too many invasive questions, of course)

mildly relevant facts about Rita:

\-she's in her early to mid 20s

\-she has a major sweet tooth

\-EXTREMELY neurotic,,,her love for coffee and amarula doesn't help with her jitters :(

\-she's friendly, though!! but can be a bit stand-offish and cold

\-believes fear is the best way to learn from something",8,1769744796.0,OriginalCharacter,14,1.0,False

I actually respected the heck out of this girl and unfortunately made me like her more. I think I am going to try to stay friends though. And I will need some advice about that but let me get into the body language part.

Basically, I met this girl at a party. She approached me first and even ask for my number after talking for 5 minutes. We had alot in common and she kept saying I was cute. I also started to hug her and touch her hands. She didnt pull away and even grab my hands as well. She did all of this while sober btw.

We had a serious convo and I think that was what messed me up. Because we started talking about red flags in dating and what are we looking for. I didnt really start this convo, she did. Turns out she is visiting from out of state. And she has never had a bf. She is extremely picky as she told me. Well once New years happen, I didnt try to kiss her which may not be a thing since we just met. Btw all of these convos happen without alcohol. She isnt a party girl nor does she go out alot. She told me that she was christian and has very high standards for men.

Anyways, I texted her the next day and ask to meet up since her flight was leaving in a day. She took forever to text me back. And when she finally did. She said that she is too busy since she is visiting friends. However, she said she would meet up in the morning of her flight.

So I just met up with her and out of the gate her body language was stiff. She no longer was relaxed and her arms were crossed. She was guarding herself. She didnt even want me to buy her coffee. We talked for 2 hrs and she rarely asked me questions yet she talked a long time to me. She wasnt self centered but it was like she already knew how it was going to go down. She told me at the end. That I am a nice guy and super sweet. She isnt looking for a bf right now and she is a horrible texter.

Dang she covered all her bases lol. But then she said she wants to be friends and will try to keep in touch. I asked if she is serious and she said yeah call me sometimes because I wouldnt mind talking to you.

So now I wonder was it because I was too nice/sweet or we just were in different stages of life. Im in med school and super busy and she is in grad school in a different state and rarely comes to my state.

That is why I wonder did she really find me attractive and I ruined it. Or was this how she was always going to play it. Also would you keep in touch as friends since she seem serious about it?

Also here is our text exchange the day after:

Her: Sarah :)

Me: Hey Sarah, this is Kyle.

It was fun playing 20 Qs with you last night

Her: Hey Kyle! I also enjoyed playing the game with you. I hope you got home safe last night! 

Me: I did. I hope you did too

Are you down to meet later tonight around 7? Love to connect one last time before you leave

Her:Are you available tomorrow morning to get coffee instead? I have dinner plans with one of my coworkers who’s moving back home tonight.

Me: Of course enjoy your dinner! How's 8:30 tomorrow sound? I know a good place \*mentioned the place\*

Her: That works for me! I love \*the place I mention\* but it’s a far drive for you. I can meet you somewhere between downtown and your hometown 

Me: It's just 30 min away lol. It's ok. I study there all the time

Her: Loved “It's just 30 min away lol. It's ok. I study there all the time”

Me: I'm 5 min way from the coffee shop

1qquk5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TakinchancesXII/comments/1qquk5v/nyx_protocol/,Nyx Protocol,"Chapter 24 – Polished Mornings

Morning light spilled through the tall windows of Minerva’s room, pale and unforgiving. It painted everything in soft gold—the marble floor, the carefully arranged furniture, the life she was expected to live.

Minerva stood before the mirror, adjusting the cuff of her sleeve with practiced precision. Civilian clothes. Neutral colors. Nothing that hinted at armor beneath the surface.

Elizabeth stood a few steps behind her, tablet in hand, eyes moving between Minerva’s reflection and a steady stream of data scrolling across the screen.

“You’re meeting your mother in forty-five minutes,” Elizabeth said calmly. “Lunch, shopping, and what she believes is a casual review of auction preparations.”

Minerva’s lips pressed into a thin line. “Casual,” she echoed. “That word never means what she thinks it does.”

Elizabeth allowed the faintest trace of amusement. “To be fair, she believes philanthropy is a controlled environment.”

Minerva exhaled through her nose and turned away from the mirror. “And the auction?”

Elizabeth tapped the tablet, bringing up a clean schematic of the venue—guest entrances, service corridors, camera placements, security stations.

“Everything is proceeding exactly as planned,” she said. “Guest list finalized. Donors confirmed. Vendors vetted. Security contractors hired.” A beat. “And every system you requested is quietly in place.”

Minerva leaned closer, scanning the layout. Her eyes lingered on a particular access corridor.

“No changes?” she asked.

“None,” Elizabeth replied. “No sudden security upgrades. No personnel reshuffling. Orren Logistics remains listed as a sponsor.” Another pause. “And your father is still… enthusiastically involved.”

Minerva’s jaw tightened—barely.

“That worries me more than if they were scrambling,” she said.

“Confidence,” Elizabeth replied evenly, “is often mistaken for control.”

Minerva straightened, rolling her shoulders once. “And surveillance?”

Elizabeth swiped again. “Live feeds seeded. Audio redundancies active. Emergency extraction routes mapped. Rowan’s teams are on standby, though they won’t move unless you give the signal.”

Minerva nodded. “Good.”

She crossed the room and picked up her coat—elegant, understated, perfectly harmless.

“And my mother?” she asked quietly.

Elizabeth’s gaze softened, just a fraction. “She believes today is about bonding. About appearances. About reminding you what it means to belong.”

Minerva’s fingers curled briefly in the fabric. “And if she asks about Father?”

Elizabeth met her eyes in the mirror. “You tell her the truth she can hear. Nothing more.”

Minerva closed her eyes for a moment.

“Sometimes,” she murmured, “I wish I didn’t have to live in the space between lies.”

Elizabeth stepped closer, adjusting Minerva’s collar with the same care she once used to check armor straps.

“You don’t,” she said quietly. “You live in the space between truth and timing.”

Minerva opened her eyes.

The heiress stared back at her—composed, flawless, unthreatening.

The Nyx waited beneath the surface.

Elizabeth stepped back, satisfied. “Your car is ready.”

Minerva lifted her chin. “Let’s go.”

As she moved toward the door, her phone buzzed once—a silent confirmation ping from the auction system.

Everything was set.

All that remained was to smile, play her part…

…and wait for the moment when daylight would no longer be enough to hide what was coming.

---

The café terrace overlooked the river, sunlight glinting off the water in soft ripples. White umbrellas swayed gently in the breeze, their shade dappling the marble tiles beneath them. It was the kind of place where time slowed on purpose.

Minerva sat across from her mother, hands wrapped around a warm porcelain cup, listening as cream and sugar were stirred with absent-minded grace.

“You look well,” her mother said, smiling over the rim of her cup. “Rested. I’m glad.”

Minerva returned the smile—this one easier than most. “I’ve been trying.”

“That’s all I ever want,” her mother replied. “You’ve spent so long being strong for everyone else. It’s nice to see you let yourself be… normal.”

Normal.

The word settled gently. Not accusatory. Not heavy. Just a wish.

Minerva glanced toward the river, watching a small boat drift past. “I don’t know if I remember how,” she admitted lightly.

Her mother laughed softly. “You were always dramatic. Even as a child. You’d scrape your knee and act as if the world had ended.”

Minerva chuckled. “I still do that. I just hide it better now.”

They shared a quiet smile.

A server arrived with plates—fresh pastries, fruit arranged artfully, the scent of coffee and citrus hanging in the air. Minerva’s mother thanked them warmly, then leaned back in her chair, content.

“I’m so glad we did this,” she said. “No meetings. No schedules. Just us.”

Minerva nodded. “Me too.”

They ate slowly, talking about small things—a new gallery opening downtown, a charity director with an inflated ego, a mutual acquaintance’s disastrous attempt at hosting a fundraiser. Nothing sharp. Nothing dangerous.

At one point, her mother reached across the table and squeezed Minerva’s hand.

“When the auction comes,” she said thoughtfully, “I hope you’ll enjoy it. Not as an obligation—but as something you want to be part of.”

Minerva met her gaze. “I’ll try.”

“That’s all I ask.” Her mother smiled. “You don’t have to carry everything alone.”

The words settled deep—not as a burden, but as kindness.

They rose after a while, strolling along the riverwalk. Sunlight filtered through trees just beginning to turn, leaves whispering softly overhead. Minerva matched her mother’s pace, allowing herself to be guided rather than lead.

For a few precious moments, there were no warehouses. No judges. No shadows.

Just a daughter walking beside her mother, listening to familiar stories—and loving them all the same.

They paused at a small overlook. Her mother gestured toward the water.

“Promise me something,” she said gently.

Minerva turned. “What?”

“Whatever path you choose… don’t forget to look up once in a while. The world isn’t always waiting to take something from you.”

Minerva nodded, throat tight but smiling. “I promise.”

Her phone buzzed softly in her pocket—ignored.

This moment belonged to daylight.

And for now…

1qquio8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qquio8,trying to decide what to do with this project. one method's a huge thread waste and makes a huge final product but i dislike doing the other,"so this year i really wanted to make all items from stardew valley as tapestry crochet pieces and eventually sew them into a picnic blanket. im starting with crops, im making about 44 of all total crops (including special crops but excluding unmilled rice and a couple others). I started this project as tapestry crochet with YU to make tighter pixel stitches. Ive gotten some good results that im proud of but im not a major fan of the whole process. ive been making the pieces as squares with a back end, so i dont have a wrong side, but its still a hard process and im not a fan of it. also with some more complicated crochet pieces (like the fucking coffee bean) it basically becomes hell on earth to make with all the color changes. then i found out about entrelac c2c and got super excited! i loveeee Tunisian crochet and the end result is so clean and beautiful! ive been making my first piece and its suuuper fun to make, especially compared to all the tapestry ive been working. I really want to continue doing this, but im running into 2 major problems

1. Im halfway through my first piece and ive run out of 2 colors of thread. it eats thread like crazy. with one of my tapestry pieces id have enough thread to make 4 more pieces the same size, with the entrelac piece it might take 3 things of thread for 1 piece.

  
2. this thing is fucking huge. the tapestry pieces are each about 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide and tall. the entrelac piece is 6x6 inches. If I made every piece as entrelac my picnic blanket (which i was hoping to be about 5 feet by 5 feet ish) would be 3 feet with just the crops alone. Im hoping to also include fish, animal produce, and even recipes if i have room. would double side this blanket, which would double the amount of entrelac pieces i could fit, but i still think id have more pieces than id be able to fit on my blanket.

  
any advice? ik im kind of placing myself in a boiling pot and crying that its too hot, but i really dont know what to do with this project! im totally fine with frogging either way. I just dont know how to progress with this :(

1qqugwh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qqugwh,Ode To Serenity Forge and The LISA Anthology (The Definitive & The Joyful).,"LISA's Definitive Anthology (The Painful & The Joyful) aren't for the faint of heart.

I'm not some pretentious erudite telling people what to like and dislike, claiming a game has to be holistically fun to be good and worth your finite time. 

That's ultimately subjective and opinions are often maellable with short-shelf lives.

But playing through the absurd cuisine that LISA has to offer is like coffee, grapefruit, and black licorice where people appreciate those comestibles for their bitternesses.

Whenever you engage with any piece of media (book, movie, hobby, and especially video game) you assume the double-edged risk of that piece refining you into your better self or radicalizing you into someone worse.

LISA is worth that risk with its unubiquitity in gamer engagement via its novel art direction and fascinating premise with Brad Armstrong, a broken protagonist with your gang on a self-involved trek across the Olathian wasteland to save his daughter, Buddy, from the entrapments of a world with only men, all desperate to avoid extinction.

As gamers, artists, connieseurs, and consumers, risk is inexorable and imperative to the human condition and must be taken lest we fall into a dark age of ennui, atrophy, and sterility.

LISA'S unubiquitous elements and diverging narrative praxis will deliver that jolt that'll dispel the static from not trying new things like calisthenics for a sedentary office job.

I have to thank Serenity Forge from the bottom of my heart for taking a chance on the LISA series and helping Austin Jorgensen republish it with Nintendo.

Giving LISA that renaissance in July 2023 and it accruing cultural relevance with the boom in subredditors and LISA fangames is heartening.

Also thank you to any charitable gamers that gave LISA a chance and LISA hopefully giving them a consumer taste-refining reference to the collective gamer consciousness.",4,1769744294.0,lisathepainfulrpg,1,1.0,False

Maxine POV
“Go home, you have worked too much overtime this week. Have an early night and give that boyfriend of yours an early treat.” My boss practically pushed me out the door, a wicked grin on his face. 

“Okay, okay, I’m going. I’m going. I straddled my bike and started her up. This was going to be a great night.

Today was my boyfriend's birthday, and I was going to give him my V-card as a special gift. I had brought new lingerie, black lace, see-through, and I had shaved my mound, leaving a trail that looked like an arrow pointing down to my juncture.

I was ready to give him my all, my first, my heart, take the big plunge. I felt I was ready. 

I pulled into the driveway to see my sister's and my boyfriend’s cars. I had no idea my sister was coming home today. She was still at college in her final year, though I heard she wasn't doing so well. The poor golden girl has not met up with expectations, not that I was worried.

My ex-boyfriend showed up three hours early; our date was not for a few more hours.

What was he doing here already?

Walking in the back door, I heard voices and headed towards them; they were in Dad’s office, with the door slightly ajar. I moved silently to the door and waited outside to hear what secrets they were having now. They occasionally do this when they are planning something and don’t want to include me, but I'm puzzled as to why my boyfriend and sister were included.

“We never planned for it to happen.” My sister replied softly, as if she were some kind of victim; she was an expert at that. She should have been an actress; she would have won multiple Oscars by now.

“When?” Dad asked, and I waited in the hallway to hear what this was all about.

“Christmas day, we had too many of your special eggnogs, and things got heated. The party was more or less over; the presents had been given out, and the food had been eaten. We were all mulling around, talking, when Zoey said something, I don’t remember what—but we went upstairs to continue talking, and ended up in Maxine’s room. We did start by just talking, and before I knew it, we were kissing and things got heated, and ended up in her bed, like I said, and I was so lost in that moment that I forgot to use a protection. When we came out, no one seemed to notice we had been gone, so we pretended it never happened.” My boyfriend replied, and my heart just hit the floor, as I took in that my sister and boyfriend did the dirty in my bed at Christmas. 

MY BED. 

I slept in that bed, with their mess on the sheets.

I feel suddenly sick at that thought. How could they do that to me?

She stole another boyfriend from me again. But he was just as much to blame; I guess our relationship was not that strong yet. Not on his side at least. He continued to pretend, kissing me and taking me out on dates, as if that never happened.

What a jerk.

Now I feel cheated, dirty, ashamed, and angry all at once. What if she hadn’t gotten pregnant, and I ended up married to that cheating scumbag? Would her wedding present be to tell me she had slept with him first? I wouldn’t put it past her to do such a thing. She had done that before with my boyfriends, and I guess this one was just as vulnerable to her advances as the last one.

“He gave me the best Christmas present ever.” My sister crowed with delight. I could imagine her tenderly touching her belly.

“This is good news. I have wanted grandchildren, and the last grandchild I would have expected would be from you; you have never kept a relationship for long.” Mum said, sounding excited at the news.

“What now?” My sister asked, still playing the perfect victim.

“We get married?’ My now ex-boyfriend suggested —sounds more like a question.

“What about Maxine?” My sister asked, as if I were an inconvenience that needed to be sorted out, and now they think about me, but it didn’t sound like concern.

“What about her? This is about my first grandchild, and his or her safety comes first. She will have to live with it.” My mother spat, revealing that famous favoritism, because she had always taken my sister's side in everything, even when proven wrong. They never backed me up.

“I am technically her boyfriend.” He started to say something, but was interrupted.

“Not anymore, you're not. I will arrange with the local publican to hire the outdoor garden area, and we shall have an engagement party this Saturday. Get that sorted before you start to show, and Maxine will show her support.” Dad’s voice floated out, sounding resolute. I had no say in this, not that I wanted to be his girlfriend any longer; he had proven not to be what I wanted in a guy.

“She will have to leave. I need her room for the nursery. I would prefer it if she didn't attend the engagement party. What will those who know she was the real girlfriend show up, and see that it was not Maxine getting engaged?” Mum added. Yep, that was my mother, trying to regain her dignity and save face.

I couldn’t take it any longer. I was devastated enough, and listening further to their support for the love for the cheater was eating me up inside. I didn’t want to cry in front of them; the tears were a mix of anger and hurt.

I pushed the door open, revealing myself standing there. 

All faces turned to look at me.

“Let me get this straight. You took my boyfriend to MY bed, did the dirty with him, leaving your mess in my bed, as a sort of Christmas present for me. Guess that made your day, thinking I was sleeping in your mess. Now you want my bedroom for the child baby you have created, and I am what, just pushed out the door? Like yesterday’s trash?” I asked to ensure I understood correctly that the whole family was fine with me being tossed aside.

“Exactly, I am taking your boyfriend, your bedroom, and you, my dear sister, have to move out.” My sister sounded like she had won the lottery. Her face beamed at her triumph.

“Fine with me.” The look of shock would have made me laugh if I were not so numb inside. I moved away to my room and packed what I could into my duffel bag. I will come back for the rest later, when they are not around.

My heart was breaking, not because I lost my boyfriend, although that hurt a lot, considering that what I was going to give him for his present today was saved for doing something foolish at least. But also because both parents were supporting this deception, as if it were the best news they had received in a while, that they had been trying to get rid of me for a while, and now succeeded in a spectacular way.

I walked downstairs and looked at them.

“When I find a place to stay, I will be back for the rest.” I spat at them, a mixture of hurt, anger, and defeat. I never fit into the family, a black sheep, so maybe I should become one. I had always had top grades, won awards, done my best, but even being first, I was still last.

My best friend was the only place I could think of going to; it had to be temporary. Jenny will be cool and let me sleep on her couch till I find a new home. I climbed onto my bike and took off to the only sanctuary I had over the years.

Jenny welcomed me into her home, like I knew she would, and together we had a pity party consisting of beer and vanilla fudge ice cream. We called the family and my ex some interesting names, some of which I had never heard before, but they sounded good. The drunker I got, the more inventive the names became.

The next morning, after waking up on Jenny’s couch and remembering yesterday, it did not go as planned. I pulled myself together, had a quick shower, and left for work. It was eight in the morning, and Jenny was still asleep when I left. That might be okay for some, but my workday today would be ten hours long, and I was running late.

“You're late, night must have gone better than planned,” Mike said jovially. They sort of knew what I was planning last night. The others chuckled along with Mike. I grumbled some shiet and got to work.

By the end of the day, Mike pulled me to his office.

“Okay, out with it. The guys have been tiptoeing around you all day. What happened? He rejected your advances?” He asked, his hand on my shoulder, keeping me in place, looking at me with concerned eyes, a father figure, better than my dad had ever been.

So, I told him what happened when I got home and where I spent the night, and now I'm looking for a place to stay. I was proud of myself; I didn’t cry, or whine, or show any emotion at all —just explained my predicament in cold, emotionless words. Clear and succinct.

He said he wouldn’t say anything in the shop, but would talk to the prez. I had no idea why, but I was not in the right frame of mind to question it.

Maxine POV 

Today was my sister's engagement party; engaged to my ex-boyfriend. 

Yeah, you heard me right, my ex. What a joke that was.

I ,  card was still intact, not that I was trying to keep it - I just never got the chance to lose it. She always managed to have any guy I was interested in dump me for her, and when she got bored with them, she’d move on. So, in a way, I didn’t have a boyfriend till she moved out of her home and headed to college.

But when my sister came home and met him, she seduced him and got pregnant. He did the whole ‘get down on one knee and proposed’ scene. Apparently, it was romantic, but I wasn't there when he did it because they didn’t want me around. It hurt a lot at the time, and I was glad to have my girlfriends around me, helping me get over it. 

They say, I dodged a bullet. 

I agree with them, stupidly. 

He might have been a sports jock with good looks, but doing this tells me he was weak and shallow, and I was too good for him, or so my BFF says. I prefer to believe them over the excuses my ex made. 

I had to move out of my home after I had a massive fight with my parents a few days ago, when the truth was exposed; they supported her, not me, and the next thing I knew, I was out the door and the evil sister. The engagement party was intended to introduce him to her friends and make the relationship official, but I was not invited. My parents want nothing to do with me. I made them all uncomfortable, considering he was my boyfriend first. Anyone working out the timeline for the baby can piece it together, and see they were cheating on me, and it would have been awkward, and too many questions would have been raised.

Not that I needed to say all of that, I kind of said it all before, but grrrrr, I am so angry at how my so-called ‘family’ kicked me out of my so-called home, with no care for me or my feelings.

It was easier to push me away and disown me than have to explain to them that my sister cheated with my boyfriend, and hey presto, a baby was on the way.

Because I was kicked out of the house, and only had a short time to pack anything, I took the opportunity of the party to sneak into the house and take more of my possessions, like opening my father's safe, and grabbing every piece of paper relating to me, and a little money too, no a lot of money, and grandma’s jewelry that she left me.

So, with the help of my BFF, we packed my belongings and took them to her place until I found a new one. I ride a motorcycle, so I need help. I have the money to buy a new place, but I'm unsure if I want to stay in this town now. Once my apprenticeship is over, I might move away. I stayed that night at Jenny’s place, as I figured out what to do.

Today, I am moving into my new place —a bungalow above the bike shop where I work. I am in my final year of apprenticeship, and I am a motorcycle mechanic, proud of it, I might add. I can also work on cars and trucks. If it had a motor, I could fix it; I always could, thanks to my knack for it, which I developed since I was eight, when I fell in love with engines. My Grandpa taught me, kept me out of everyone's way. I guess you could say I was a tomboy, with no frills and lace. My Grandpa kept me sane and busy, so the BS in our house didn’t hurt me as much.

The place has two bedrooms and is fully contained, meaning it has everything I need. I had purchased some new sheets and towels, that sort of thing, but it had a fully stocked kitchen; I only needed to buy the food. It might be small, and above a noisy bike shop, but at night it was a quiet area. No one would break into this shop; the local bikie gang owned it. They were good guys, scary, but so far, no trouble for me. 

My BFF, Jenny, was helping me take my belongings upstairs when a group of bikers arrived and assisted us. I had five boxes and two suitcases filled with all sorts of items.

“Thanks, guys, for the help,” I said sweetly, my BFF batting her eyes at them and swaying her hips suggestively as she walked and thanked them.

She makes me laugh with her antics, which are totally opposite to mine. I like jeans and am rarely seen in a dress, whereas she was seldom seen in jeans.

“We got a party at the clubhouse, tomorrow Saturday, you should come and relax a bit, bring your girls with ya,” Bruiser suggested as he threw his arm over my shoulder, walked me to the settee, pushed me down, and handed me a beer they had brought with them. 

This was how they acted around me, ordered me about. Sometimes, I'm okay with it; other times, I get all worked up and growl back at them. Today was acceptance. I know they mean well, and I feel lucky to have them as family; they try to make me feel better.

“That sounds like a blast, count me in, and I can bring two other girl friends with us. Max, do you want me to pick you up?” Jenny offered, taking a beer from one of the guys. She was not a beer drinker; however, in this situation, I could see her not refusing anything they offered. I guess I'm going, whether I want to or not.

“No, I’ll ride over,” I replied as one of the guys ordered pizza.

“That’s the spirit. Nothing like the wind in your hair to blow the cobwebs away.” They stayed because they didn’t want me to be alone, not on my first night here.

Pizza arrived not long after, and my little bungalow was soon feeling too small and crowded, with six huge bikers in the room. Some sat on the floor; others pulled up one of the three kitchen chairs. I know, I know, three chairs sound odd, but that's what was here, and beggars can’t be choosers; the rent was dirt cheap, and I think the boys are the ones to make sure I had everything I needed. 

They found out about my situation the next day, because, I was still quiet at work, which was not like me, often I am singing to the radio, or swearing at something, so one of the guys approached me, to find out what gives, and I softly told them, what went down, and when word got around the bikers heard I needed a place to stay, because I was kicked out of my home and why, they came to me, like protective brothers. Now I have a whole gang of bikers who have my back. I feel privileged to call them friends. 

They even offered to rough the ex up for me, but I refused the offer, because strangely, I was happy to get rid of the loser if he was a cheating build. Better now than when I am fully invested in our relationship. Plus, I was in deep enough shite with my parents and sister without making it worse. 

The pizza was gone, my BFF left for home, and the guys did too. It was late, well, for me, midnight. I usually fall asleep quickly because I have to be up for work at five. Tomorrow, being Saturday, I have the morning shift before the party later. They let me leave work early so I can move in here.

“Hey, don’t forget to come, we need our prettiest mechanic at the party, some of the boys might need a tune-up,” Bruiser said with a laugh as they climbed on their bikes and left. I know what sort of tune-up he was talking about, and it had nothing to do with a motor.

I looked around my new home. It wasn’t much, but it was all mine. The guys were great; they took the empty pizza boxes and beer cans with them, and the place was relatively clean. Not at all what you would expect from a group of rowdy men.

The clubhouse.

I had never been to it, despite having worked there for nearly four years, and they had never extended an invitation to me. I know they had lots of parties; maybe I was too young. I turned twenty recently, but they might think of me as the fifteen-year-old who showed up one day and told the boss I was going to be his apprentice. He laughed at first and said he would give me a go to prove myself. He thought I was joking and that I would be gone by the weekend, but over the holidays, I worked hard and have been here ever since.

Maxine POV

The beeping sound of my phone alarm made me sit up and look around. It took a moment to remember where I was. The room had a small curtain that barely kept the light out. There was a streetlight just outside my window. I can envisage myself getting better blackout curtains soon. Although it was annoying, it wasn't among my top priorities for making this a home. 

The shower was decent, with nice pressure. I followed my morning routine, only to realize how foolish I was to wake up so early, living above my place of work; I didn’t need to ride here. After finishing breakfast and cleaning up the kitchen, I still had half an hour before I needed to be at work. 

I had two ways to get into my place: one was through the back stairs, and the other was through the shop. With the code to turn off the alarm, I decided to head down and start work early. It was better than moving stuff around; I can do that later. I had a bike to finish by this afternoon. The customer would be here at two.

Turned off the alarm, turned on the coffee pot, the radio, and headed to my workstation, where the fat boy was waiting for me to finish. I sat on the stool with casters and began my job, singing loudly to the heavy rock song that came on the radio as I installed the new spark plugs and double-checked the oil. It was a simple, easy-peasy service. Once finished, I started the bike up, let it idle while I made coffee, then returned to rev it a few times. It sounds lumpy, like it was just turning over perfectly; it was music to my ears. I love that throaty, deep, lumpy sound. You can feel it vibrate through my chest.

“That’s a sound I loved to hear as I enter work.” My boss, Mike, said as I turned the bike off.

“It’s ready to go, unless you want to take it out for a test ride. Want a coffee, pots hot.” I offered as I threw the dirty rag in the bin.

“Sure, I will take the bike out for a spin, and you can make me a coffee.” He smirked as he grabbed the bike. I opened the garage door, and Mike took off. I smiled as he disappeared down the street, and I turned to make both of us coffee. If you hadn’t guessed already, I would drink a lot of coffee. I am not a fan of soft drinks or tea; for me, it's coffee or water. 

With a broom in hand, I began cleaning the shop. I am not out here very often, but I try to sweep the floor at least once a week; they have another apprentice who’s a second year, who gets to do most of the cleaning up, but he’s never here on a Saturday.

The sound of the bike returning prompted me to pick up the two cups of coffee and head back out to the workshop. Mike had a massive grin on his face as he parked the bike.

“Great job, you are our top mechanic. But don’t tell anyone, or I will have to deny it.” He joked, taking his coffee from my hand as he walked by, no doubt letting the customer know the bike was ready ahead of time.

I moved to the next bike, which was a total rebuild; it had been in a minor accident, and while the frame was being checked, I would work on the engine and gearbox. It was the only job on my list at the moment. The bike owner was in no hurry; he had a broken leg, giving me a few weeks to work on his bike and any urgent jobs that might come into the shop.

The client arrived and happily took possession of his bike, very happy with the job done.

“I hear you’ve been invited to the club party tonight,” Mike said as he rang up the sale on the cash register.

“Yep.” I said popping the ‘p’.

“You can leave now, we have no more customers expected. Good job today.” It was close to one o’clock, near the time I would knock off.

“Thanks, boss.” I saluted him and rushed upstairs, before he could change his mind. Giggling all the way up. I heard him chuckling as he locked the door below, behind me. 

I decided on a quick shower; I didn’t want to smell of oil when going to a party. Put on my skinny black jeans, a black blouse that had red flames on the back and on the pockets, black boots that had some chains around the ankle, and hair in a ponytail. I will get what we call helmet hair, so it's a waste to do much with it now. I use mascara and strawberry lip gloss, which is more to moisturize my lips, which tend to dry out when I ride my bike, and that's it. The last thing I grabbed before leaving was my jacket.

My mum used to grumble that I wasn’t like my sister and put more effort into my appearance, but I like who I am, and I didn’t like wearing lots of makeup; it was my choice, and I feel that I am not a frilly, lacey chick. It was a deal breaker with my mum. She had my sister dress up and left me in the care of Grandpa until he died when I was seventeen. 

It broke me when he left the world. He was the only person who got me. My grandma had been gone since I was young, and I filled the hole in his heart with my love for bikes and fishing. He left me his money and bikes. Dad got his house and business. My mum hated that I gained all that money. When Grandma died, she left me her jewelry, and Grandpa made sure to keep it safe till I was old enough to have it. 

I ate something and put some more of my stuff in the cupboards before my phone chimed to let me know my girlfriends were on their way to the party.

I pulled my bike out of the small garage and started it up. I threw my leg over and took off, heading to the property. The clubhouse was half an hour out of town, set on a large property a little bit back from the road. 

Ten minutes later, I came up behind the girls and hung out behind them. My friend waved me on to take the lead. I shrugged and overtook her. The turn off arrived, and I rode happily up the long drive, and trees lined the road. An open, large steel gate appeared, and I was glad it was still enough light to see clearly. 

Men stood by the entrance, watching us arrive.

“Hey.” I greeted the biggest man I had ever seen.

“Who invited you here?” The man asked gruffly, in a deep husky voice.

“Bruiser,” I answered, with a firm, clear voice, hoping that the fact that he frightened me would be noticed in my voice.

He pulled out his phone and called, I assumed, Bruiser.

“Max?” He asked, as he looked at me questioningly, and I nodded. He said something more and hung up the phone.

“Come in, the car behind your girls?” He looked at the car behind, which clearly had a woman in it.

“Yep,” I replied, not at all liking how he intimidated me with his manner. 

Perhaps it was the way they greeted strangers. 

One look makes the weak run.

Well, I am not weak, and I won't be running. 

Maxine POV

This rather large biker leaned in to look inside the car, his bulky figure partially blocking the open window, causing the girl nearest it to back away. 

Satisfied, he looked at me with a knowing smirk, then motioned for us to enter.

The clubhouse was nothing like I had imagined. Firstly, it was four levels high. Verandah all the way around, that I could see. It was more like a mansion than a clubhouse.

Women were gathered near the door, looking in, as if they were waiting for something; some were sitting on the wooden fence that surrounded the verandah. They were dressed in barely anything, showing all that was available, some love that sort of thing. People like me dress to stay warm or cool and don’t care about showing off the goods.

Bikes sat in neat rows in front, and cars were parked to the left of the building; the ratio of bikes to cars was approximately four bikes to one car. 

I parked the bike with the others, climbed off, and took off my helmet. I placed the lid on the bike and shook out my hair while waiting for the girls to park and come to me. I heard some muffled scoffs, but I couldn’t care less —I wasn't here to please them.

Bruiser came out of the clubhouse behind me.

“Max, you came by bike. Sweet.” He gave me a gentle squeeze and moved to take a closer look at my bike. The paint job was a wolf, fading in smoke. It took me months to finish, as I kept changing my mind, and the smoke obscured the mistakes.

“Who did the paint job?” He asked as he moved around to look at it from all sides.

“Me.” I was proud of the results.

“Does Mike know you can paint?” He sounded surprised.

“He has seen my bike when I used the garage to do a service. He never asked who did the paint work, just that he liked it.”

“Sweet, looks like we have someone to do touch-ups, and possibly a full paint job. We have a family reunion in a few weeks, and the ladies are invited to come along. You can join us.” Bruiser offered as my ladies arrived; they were not included in that invitation, I assumed, because I have a bike.

“Bruiser, you already met Jenny, Melony, Karen, and Heather, my other BFF, and Alice, Karen's sister, and BFF to my sister.” Adding that comment, hoping that Bruiser knew precisely what that woman was like. Alice battered her eyes and leaned forward to show off what was under that almost shirt. My ladies greeted him with the respect he deserved.

“Ladies. Hands out.” Bruiser stamped the girl's backs of their hands; they all had a bear, except Alice, who had a rabbit on her hand. I frowned, trying to figure out what the rabbit was all about.

He pushed my hand away.

“You are family, no need for a stamp.” I couldn’t stop the smile that crossed my face. I felt so special. Then the shoe dropped. Rabbit meant she would open her legs. Bruiser got my meaning loud and clear. It took a while to understand the purpose of the stamps.

“Come inside and meet the ole ladies.” I understood what he meant; these were ladies who had been claimed and had a different level of respect that those not claimed would never understand. I have met a few of them over the years and gained more insight into club life. They respect me as much as I respect them.

We entered the place, and the girls who had been waiting outside gave us a dirty look, as they were still stopped from entering. 

“What's so special about them?” One pouted, but Bruiser ignored her.

Inside was cleaner than I had expected —my fault for judging a group of men, since they often look messy when I see them at the shop. The place had a large, open space, with tables where you stand, as well as booths dotted along the walls, and stools at the bar, which ran the full length of the room. I loved the spacious room, the pictures on the walls, and some bike parts scattered about as decoration. A few barstools are bike seats; it was different, and it appealed to me. Being a lover of bikes. 

“Sticks.” I greeted her as we got closer to the ladies Bruiser was taking us to.

“Hey, Maxie Max. How's it blowing?” She stood up and pulled me into a warm embrace. This chick had no filter or personal space. Sticks was the President's; her real name was Sandra, but she was my height at five-nine, and she had no shape to her body, just a lovely bean pole, almost no chest to speak of, yet she had had two boys. Hence the name Sticks. 

“Doing better,” I replied. She would know what was going on.

She introduced us to the other ladies with her, and it didn’t surprise me that Alice had already moved away from us before we had finished the introductions.

“What’s her story?” Sticks asked as she watched Alice start to try her luck with the club men.

“Same as my sister. Bruiser put a rabbit stamp on her hand.” Sticks and the other girl roared out laughing. 

“She will be used, abused, and kicked to the side by the time the night is over, and I doubt they would let her back in. We don’t need her sort in the club.” Maggie spouted as we watched a patch member knock her offer back.

“The regulars are not going to like her working their turf. So, to speak.” Tootsie said, with a smirk, that the regulars know the rules and stick with them.

Don’t approach a patch member; if interested, they will come to you. 

Nom’s are fair game.

But most girls would prefer a patch member.

Don’t touch a taken member; the women will gang up and make your life miserable if you feel one of theirs. 

Wait to be let into the clubhouse and then stay in the public area.

No going upstairs uninvited. 

The first two floors are designated for guest rooms, while the top floor is reserved for permanent residences. Those who don’t have a home of their own to go to. They are private and not open to wandering girls.

Don’t touch or sit on someone’s bike, unless you are given permission.

The patched old ladies are the bosses of the girls; they tell you to leave or do something, and you do it.

There were more rules for the girls visiting, but I couldn’t remember them all at that moment. None had applied to me until now.

Alice had already broken at least three, to my knowledge. I am staying out of it. That rabbit on her hand told the members that she would open her legs for any of them, and no one would support her if she broke the rules. That she was not welcome to return, in other words, have your fun, and then kick her to the curb.

The doors were opened to let the other girls in. They looked at us in the no-go zone and pouted. We were sitting in an off-limits area unless we were invited. From what I understood, they were here to spread their legs and give the guys some relief, but not become part of the family. They might be hopeful that something would change; it was rare for a patch member to take one of these ladies, who had most likely been with every unattached member of the gang, at some point.

My girls left me with Sticks and wandered about with the other ladies, getting the tour of the place.

“Want to look around?” Sticks were offered, and before I knew it, we were walking around the vast ground floor.

“Ready to see the workshop, the guys might talk you into helping out, once they know who you are.” Sticks led me down a small pathway, lined with flowering shrubs, and to a set of large, farm-size sheds. Inside were bikes, some in bits, others crumpled from an accident, and others like they had just been detailed and were someone's pride and joy. 

There was a workshop here, where men were working on their bikes. They looked up at us when we entered and frowned. If Sticks were not with me, they would have most likely growled at me to get out.

“Who’s this Sticks?” A monster of a man asked, in the deepest voice I have ever heard, he looked a lot like the man at the gate, but with more toned muscles, that I would love to run my fingers over. Just a tad taller, and although he looked big and scary, he made my lady parts sing in a way they had never sung before.

Tank POV

A few guys aren't into parties, so I stopped going until later in the night, when the girls who showed up were already taken. I dislike the women who come here hoping to adopt our lifestyle. I prefer to use my hand rather than one of those women. 

Don’t get me wrong, I have had my share of women; however, I had a girl who pushed me to take her, and when I did, she ended up in the hospital, because I am not exactly a little man, and I ripped her apart. She needed stitches, and I have not been with a woman since.

Like my brother, we are both large men; he is six feet six inches tall, and I am six feet eight inches tall. He’s carrying extra weight, where I am all muscle. I pride myself on keeping in shape, but being this large has its downfall, and having a large build has had me worried about hurting another woman. No matter how much I might want to, I can’t; I never want to go through that again.

The Prez was the only person who knew why I wouldn’t join the parties; he was with me when we took the girl to the hospital, she forgave me, and tried to pursue me to keep her, but I couldn’t. Each time I started to get intimate, I had flashes of her screams, and my confidence went down like a popped balloon.

We were in the workshop, doing some minor tune-ups. As I prepare for our ride, I'm excited. When they bring the ladies, the men are usually in a better mood and on their best behavior.

I was looking at rebuild. I started it last week. We have a few wrecks that need to be started; some have been sitting here far too long. We can only go so far before we need Mike's help. None of us was a mechanic. I was scratching my head, as I was almost at the end of my knowledge, when I heard someone enter, and a soft perfume that shouldn’t be in this shed hit my nose. Stick’s voice reached my ears, and I lifted my head up to look in her direction.

“Who’s this Sticks?” The most beautiful girl I have ever seen had entered our sanctuary, a place where few girls are allowed, which made Sticks bring this beauty down to this dirt and grease, which was unexpectedly.

“That is Max, from the shop, Mike's apprentice, who I think had finished her apprenticeship and is doing something extra on Harleys and getting some specialized license,” Banjo said as he moved forward to greet them. The others stood up and moved forward too, making me feel like a dill for not recognizing Max. Although I have only seen her a few times from a distance, and she was usually deep in bike repair, I barely got to see her face. We have not been introduced because I wouldn’t have forgotten that beauty if I had.

Sticks introduced us all, and we greeted her before I decided I could use her help. I put the thoughts of what I wouldn’t mind doing to her behind me, not that I could do it.

“Max, come look at this wreck. I am stuck with what to do next.” I called her over on the bike I was working on. 

“Tank, surely you could have waited for another day? She came for the party, not to work.” Sticks grumbled as Max walked to me. She was clean and smelled nice, and I had a fleeting moment of guilt for calling her over. The few times I had seen her, she was covered in oil and grease, wearing coveralls that hid her shapely figure.

“Max, are you sure?” Sticks pulled on her hand to get her attention.

“Yeah, I am more at home in here than out there,” Max said with a smile and turned back to me.

“What's the problem?” She asked me to move forward and inspect the bike.

I went into detail about what happened to the bike, what I had managed to do so far, and what I needed to move forward. Max removed her leather jacket and slung it over a nearby bike seat, then squatted down.

For the next two hours, Max worked on the bike with me, guiding me through the tricky bits I couldn’t do. The others came forward and used this time as a sort of training session, and Max didn’t seem to mind at all. We asked questions as she worked on the bike, and she used me to lift the heavy parts. It was teamwork, and we completed more repairs in that time than I would have on my own.

“Hey, Max,” Bruiser called out at the door. He stood with his legs apart, arms folded, and I wondered if we had done something wrong.

“Back here.” She returned to the call of her name.

He arrived and burst out laughing at us.

“Max, I invited you to a party, you know, dancing and drinking, and socializing. This was not what I meant as a party.” He was still chuckling when the Prez walked in, with Sticks on his arm.

“You still got her working out here?” Stick all but growled at us, when the Prez’s lady growls, we all listen. She’s the last person we want to make angry.

“What?” I was confused, Max didn’t seem to mind, and we all were having a good time out here.

“Hey, Prez. The party over?” Max calmly asked, but it sounded more like she had hoped it was.

“Not even close, babes.” The Prez answered with a smile. He had gotten closer to Max over the years she had been at the bike shop. He had often talked about the female mechanic and her sassy ways. I had thought he was exaggerating, but after spending a little time with her, I was hooked. 

“We have nearly completed the repair job on Spider's bike. If we can have Max here for a few days, I bet we could hit the road by the end of the week.” I said it as it was my way of asking her to stay for a while and fix the bike. Spider was almost healed and ready to get back on his own bike.

“Would have to ask Mike about that, she’s his employee, even if we own the shop, he runs it, and I don’t get involved with his employees,” Prez replied contemplatively.

“He here?” I asked, as Mike often doesn’t show up at the weekend parties.

“Yep, came half an hour ago.” Sticks answered as she handed Max a bottle of water.

“Max, if Mike’s okay with it, would you work with us for a week, get some of these ready for the weekend ride?” Sparks asked, and I kicked myself for not considering that she might not want to spend a week here.

“Sure, if Mike doesn’t need me, we have several bikes in for service before the ladies run.” Her sweet voice carried across the warehouse, and the guys nodded in understanding.

“Thanks, babes,” Spike called out. Each one of us here enjoyed that she worked on our bikes; it might sound odd that we're letting a chick touch our bikes, but Max was not like most chicks. Who wants to sit on the bikes or lie on them? Max knows what she’s doing and has proven herself on numerous occasions. I wish I had known how attractive she was. Man, I had a semi since she walked in the door.

The Prez will even let her ride her own bike, a privilege few ladies get. She was more part of the crew; no other girl I know works on bikes like she does, and her reputation over the time she's been an apprentice has been exemplary. Not a guy chaser. 

When word got out that our girl had been cheated on in the worst possible way, we all wanted to go and kill the man, even though half of us had never really met her, yeah, seen her in a distance, or legs poking out from under a truck, but never sat and talked with her before today.

She was fun, had me chuckling a few times, but most of the time in here, she had been all about the bikes, and not flirting, like most chicks do when around us. They see the glamour of the lifestyle, but it's not for everyone.

Maxine POV

I was guided to a washroom on the side of the workshop, which had a deep steel sink and a shower, but no mirrors. There was a cupboard under the sink containing soaps and cleaning products, as well as a shelf with dark-colored towels. A door that led to a toilet, which was cleaner than I had expected. So far, this whole gang house had been cleaner than I thought a load of men would leave it. 

I had underestimated the guys and made assumptions about how guys I knew from school or parties would act; none of them were like that. Maybe it was because they are mostly men, whereas my experience had been with boys my age

1qqua7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperthyroidism/comments/1qqua7l/coffee_aggravates_my_graves_disease_symptoms/,Coffee aggravates my Graves Disease symptoms,"Hey everyone — I’m posting here mostly to get feedback and see if anyone else has experienced something similar.

The last \~2 years have been rough. I was diagnosed with Graves’ disease in April 2023. Within 3 months, I lost about 20 lbs (I was already naturally skinny at \~123 lbs). I had tremors, extreme itching, constant sweating, and a long delay before I could even see an endocrinologist.

Once I finally did, I started methimazole and stabilized pretty quickly — within about 10 days.

What really confused me happened about 7 months ago. I’m not a coffee drinker, but one day I had coffee and my body completely freaked out. It honestly felt like a heart attack: shaking, intense anxiety, and nonstop sweating day and night for two weeks. I also had puffy eyes, dark circles, dry/scaling skin, dandruff, and this weird “sweaty” sensation on my scalp. It was worse than my original diagnosis.

Since then it’s been an on-and-off rollercoaster, and it made me realize how hard it is to identify triggers — especially food-related ones.

Because of that, I started working on a mobile app for myself first to help track ingredients and identify potential autoimmune triggers. I collaborated with two experienced nutritionists (one in the U.S., one in Spain) to sanity-check everything, but I’m still very much in “learning mode.”

I’d genuinely love feedback from this community:

    •	Have you noticed sudden reactions like this to coffee or specific foods?
    
    •	Do you track ingredients or triggers in any structured way?
    
    •	What would actually be helpful (or annoying) in a tool like this?

If anyone is open to sharing their experience or thoughts, I’d really appreciate it. Having autoimmune condition can feel incredibly isolating, and hearing from others helps more than I expected.

Feel free to DM and I can share the Google App Play Store details so you can check out the app and give some feedback.",1,1769743761.0,Hyperthyroidism,0,1.0,False

I've been a personal trainer for a long time now, with most of my clients looking to lose weight and get in shape. As I love my job, I would like to connect and understand each and every one of my clients as much as possible. 

  
Lately I've been thinking about setbacks because I saw one of my ex-clients on the streets a few days ago, we reached his goal and he decided to carry on by himself, without me. Unfortunately, he's almost back to where he was when we started back in the day. I sat down for a quick coffee with him and he's told me that he gained just about all of the weight back (work, stress, lack of time)... 

  
I've personally ""quit"" the gym for at least 3 or 4 times in my life, just had enough, fully fed-up, needed to take the time outside of that place. In those times, I told myself just about a million different excuses to not hit the gym (none of them actually viable). But, I did notice a pattern in **some** of my clients that they tend to slow down if not completely give up (and start making excuses) as soon as I'm out of the picture and they decide to go on by themselves.

  
I would love to hear your stories about setbacks and how you deal with them, how you keep that motivation up and running when you feel like there is none left. Did you ever quit and why? How did you resume after that? Is it easier for you to have someone with you who pushes you to do it even on those days when you feel like you'd rather stay home, or do you prefer to do it alone?

  
Appreciate anyone who takes the time to respond, and if sharing helps you reflect too, that’s a bonus. I am just looking to learn something new and understand each and every one of my clients as much as possible.",3,1769743450.0,loseit,1,0.8,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

My sweet little buddy passed away in May and I miss him so much.  He was a rescue... or maybe a rescuer.  He'd been mistreated by someone, but found his best (and safe!) life with us!  He was fine one day and then so, so sick the next.  Apparently, he had pancreatitis (all of a sudden!)... we couldn't figure out how, but then they discovered he had stomach cancer.  He wouldn't eat and was starving to death, so we made the truly hard decision to say goodbye.  It's been 8 months and I still find myself looking for him!  

Indy had two speeds -- lazy and crazy.  He stole every blanket and quilt we owned for himself.  He was 17 lbs, but took 1/2 of the bed.  He loved food -- any food (including dead worms), but wouldn't touch my husband's coffee.  He decided he owned me the day we brought him home -- he was always snuggled next to me on the couch and got upset when I closed the bathroom door.  He loved to play fetch -- he chased the ball, but never understood to bring it back.  If you were a rabbit, squirrel or lizard, you were going to be chased, but he wouldn't hurt you if he caught you -- it was all a game to him. If he caught a good smell he'd anchor himself and a large truck couldn't move him.   He loved kids, old people... anyone who would love him.  And... we did!

1qqu02v,https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1qqu02v/how_much_should_it_actually_cost_to_a6_a/,How much should it ACTUALLY Cost to A6 a character? I did some math:,"TLDR: If you're on mobile AND are on the Google play store, it should cost you approximately $681.26

Edit 1: Subtract 15 cents. I rounded the reoccurring purchases. (Too lazy to go back and repaste the page, so the true total based on removing the rounding errors should be 681.11)

Edit 2: Costs on PC may be higher than costs on mobile. I didnt have EVERYTHING purchased for the monthly and limited plans (namely the tier 2 and 3 versions), so I went based off of PC numbers that I found on Lufel.net and the official site, but on mobile, the 10 limited platinum card purchase only costs $10, while the PC price says $12. So, the total might be off by about $10

Edit 3: forgot to include the metajewels you get from answering text messages.

If you see any mistakes in my numbers, or have more accurate figures for the ""Sale Bundles"" in Marythm's shop, don't hesitate to correct me. 

Assumptions -------------------
1. All 4-stars are at A6.
2. Logged in and completed dailies for the full cycle (28 days).
3. Purchasing all shop deals (7 day rewards, monthly reward, Phantom Pass, monthly and limited shard packages).
4. Worst pity luck (110 Max pity on each pull)
5. You are not using cognigems from any standard pulls or weapon pulls.
6. You dont get any gems or cards from any city life activities, Synergies, Lufel Plans, Velvet Trials, awards, etc.
6. Assuming you are not using or have already exhausted all of your lvl training set rewards.
7. Assuming that this is your first time ever buying Cognition crystals.
8. You are starting with 0 meta jewels and 0 violet cognigems.
9. Assuming you are making your purchases through Google Play (1% cash back in the form of Google Play Credit to be used on any In App Purchase or app purchase). And no other cash back rewards.

Metajewl income based off of a 28-day banner cycle, how much would I have to spend to A6 a limited banner character (7 pulls assuming max pity)

7X (150 x 110 = 16,500) = 115,500 meta jewels
770 pulls (77 multis)
For every 4 star dupe, you get 15 cognigems (150 metajewels)
For every 5 star (not A6) you get 30 cognigems (300 metajewels)

Every 10 pulls (multis) is guaranteed a 4 star
In the 110 banner, the only 5 star you can get is the Featured character.
- Now we subtract the guaranteed return on pulls
77 x 15 x 10 = 11,550
77 multis x 15 cognigems x 10 metajewls per cognigem = 11,550 metajewels
- Lets add the five 5 star dupes to that number 11,550 + 1,500 = 13,050
There is a 6.2% chance that you will receive an extra 4 star EVERY pull.
That equates to about 47 extra 4 star dupes

47 x 15 x 10 = 7,050

That’s a grand total of 20,100 meta jewels

F2P 28 DAY REWARDS
Now, let’s tally what you get for logging in and playing regularly EVERY day:

Daily Challenge Goals (Task/120 energy spent/3 time slots used/ and login)
4 x 20 x 28 = 2,240
4 challenges x 20 gems per task x 28 days = 2,240 gems
Tasks 10 metajewels a day
10 x 28 = 280
10 for the daily task x 28 days
Sea of Souls (Assuming Rank 5 or higher)
2 x 750 = 1,500
Two 14 day runs x 750 per run
Gates of the Nightmare Catcher
4 x 320 = 1,280
Four weekly runs x 320 per run

Total rewards = 5,300 metajewels

Exchange Shop rewards
Refreshes monthly
1000 metajewels(clear gem rewards)
3 platinum tickets (Login) = 450 metajewels
Exchange total = 1,450 metajewels
MISC
600 gems at the beginning of the season for maintenance
60 for 2 character trials
60 for 2 confidants
60 for 6 Missions
2500 gems for whatever special events are running including ny Palace/Mementos/Crossroads of Fate events going on
MISC TOTAL = 3,280

Total metajewelsfrom doing 770 pulls and playing the game as intended for 28 days Not factoring purchases = 30,130

Therefore, you have to spend money to make up the extra 115,500 - 30,130 = 85,370

After that, you get the most Cogni-crystals per dollar by purchasing the 6,000 pack
Cogni-crystal ratio
crystals per dollar (c/d)
(“bonus” gems included)
60 pack = 60 cpd  ($.99)
270 pack = 68.44 cpd ($3.99)
540 pack = 62.1 cpd ($7.89)
1680 pack = 68.6 cpd ($24.49)
2800 pack = 69.15 cpd ($40.49)
6000 pack = 72.3 cpd ($82.99)

Current total spent: $550
Gems left to get 45,420 - 19,600 = 25,820

Before we do the final bit of math, let’s go over the money back from Google Play

There is a Tier System.
Bronze: 0 points required ($0 spent total) [$1 to 1 point ratio]
Silver: 150 points required ($150 spent total) [$1 to 1.1 point ratio]
Gold: 600 points required ($559.09 spent total) [$1 to 1.2 point ratio]
Platinum: 3,000 points required [$1 to 1.4 point ratio]

Platinum won’t be necessary to look at.

At $550 spent, you would have a total of 590 points accumulated ($5.90 cents in play credit)

Getting back to the main figures

25,820/6000 = 4 (6k packs)
25,820 - 24,000 = 1,820 remaining cogni-crystals $331.96 (4x82.99)
1,820 - 1,680 = 140 remaining cogni-crystals $24.49
140 - 180 = 40 additional cogni-gems $2.97 (0.99x3

So I'm from America, and I'm Asian but I'm not Chinese, but I have a lot of Chinese friends. I've been getting interested in traditional Chinese medicine lately and I'm someone with frequent stomach/digestive issues.  One of my Chinese friends told me to drink hot water often everyday as it's a part of traditional Chinese culture to do so. 

  
I've been doing this for 2 months now and it has dramatically helped my stomach and digestion. I do not even drink coffee or tea ever but the hot water habit is a game changer. 

  
So I'm curious what is the traditional belief and science behind drinking hot water for digestion? :)",8,1769742875.0,AskAChinese,10,0.83,False
1qqty4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1qqty4e/how_am_i_supposed_to_treat_my_dad/,How am I supposed to treat my dad,"Posting on a burner because people know my main account. 

My dad (61M) is genuinely a very confusing person and I (16M) do not know how I’m supposed to treat him and I’m very much not handling it well. 

My dad is North African. He grew up in what I think was a pretty traditional family, but I wouldn’t know since he hardly talks about them (but also wants me to know them and interact with them, despite them living across the globe?). He’s very religious, and mostly traditional. 

My problem right now is that he wants me to befriend him and get close to him, but whenever I make any sort of progress when it comes to that, he immediately makes me feel awful and says “you have no right talking to me like that, I’m your father”. 

About 30 minutes ago I was playing video games and then I spoke to him. I can’t remember exactly what it was about (probably something about coffee machines, since he was telling me which one he wanted 10 minutes prior) but that’s irrelevant. He was waiting for the water to start boiling and scrolling or looking at his phone. 

So I spoke to him, got no reply. Spoke again, he wasn’t paying attention. So then I called for his attention, and said “Look how your phone’s taken over your brain?” (A phrase he repeats to me and my siblings practically daily) and I said it in a joking way. 

So he looks up at me, tells me that I wasn’t raised well, and says that’s something that should never be said to your father. 

Sure, I guess. But then there’ll be another moment where it’s just me and him at night, after he comes home from work, and he watches TV and tries talking to me. He’s like “I’m always talking to you and you always embarrass me” or “I try to be your friend and you never want the same” (or something of the like). 

I don’t feel comfortable talking to him. I don’t feel comfortable saying stuff to him. 

He also always singles me out for things. My siblings (18F, 18M, and 27F) are all in university therefore we don’t see much of them. I’m at school until 3:00 and he comes home at 6:00. My siblings come home at 10:00 or even 12:00 so he only really focuses on me. What I do wrong, or he wants me to talk to him. But then he goes and does what happened today.  

The gist of it is that he wants to raise good kids but doesn’t want to do any of the effort. He wants to tell us what to do but doesn’t want to actually do it. He’ll say “don’t do this” but then he goes and does it. This is especially annoying when I see the annoying traits he does appearing in myself, then I try to stop it I just revert to my old ways. 

So my question is, how do I treat my dad? And also how do I stop the bad things he does from seeping into my brain/get rid of them?

The smartest people I know all do these borderline weird things that most of us would never think to try. Not the obvious stuff like reading before bed or whatever. I'm talking about legitimately odd behaviors that make zero sense until you understand the science behind them.

Turns out intelligence isn't just about IQ or genetics. It's about daily habits that literally rewire your brain. And the research is pretty wild on this. I pulled from neuroscience journals, behavioral psychology studies, and insights from researchers who have spent decades studying cognitive performance. Here's what actually separates smart people from everyone else.

**They deliberately make themselves uncomfortable** 

Not in a toxic hustle culture way, but strategically. Research from Stanford shows that cognitive growth happens when you're slightly stressed, what they call ""optimal anxiety."" Smart people seek out situations where they feel dumb. They'll take classes in subjects they know nothing about, have conversations with people way smarter than them, or read dense material that makes their brain hurt. The discomfort is the point. Your brain only builds new neural pathways when it's challenged beyond its current capacity. The book ""Peak"" by Anders Ericsson goes deep on this. He's the psychologist who spent 30 years studying expert performance and interviewed everyone from chess grandmasters to Olympic athletes. The main insight is that true skill building requires what he calls ""deliberate practice,"" which is basically forcing yourself into uncomfortable learning situations repeatedly. This book completely changed how I approach learning anything new. It's not about putting in 10,000 hours, it's about making those hours strategically uncomfortable.

**They talk to themselves out loud constantly** 

Not just internal monologue but actual verbal processing. Cognitive psychology research shows that externalizing your thoughts through speech activates different brain regions than silent thinking. When you speak your reasoning out loud, you catch logical errors faster and make better decisions. Smart people narrate their problem-solving process, argue with themselves about solutions, and verbally walk through complex concepts. It looks absolutely unhinged to observers but the cognitive benefits are legit. It's called ""self-directed speech"" in the research, and it's how children naturally learn; we just get socialized out of it as adults.

**They actively seek out being wrong**

Most people unconsciously protect their beliefs and get defensive when challenged. Smart people do the opposite; they hunt for disconfirming evidence. They'll deliberately read opinions they disagree with, ask people to poke holes in their arguments, and change their mind publicly when presented with better data. The podcast ""The Knowledge Project"" by Shane Parrish breaks this down beautifully across multiple episodes. He interviews Nobel Prize winners, CEOs, and researchers about their thinking processes. The common thread is intellectual humility and the ability to hold contradictory ideas simultaneously without your ego imploding. That's real intelligence—not being right but being willing to be wrong efficiently.

**They do absolutely nothing for extended periods**

Not scrolling on their phone or watching TV, but genuine unstimulated boredom. Neuroscience research shows that your brain's default mode network, which is responsible for creative insights and memory consolidation, only activates during rest periods. Smart people schedule ""think time,"" where they literally just sit and let their mind wander. No inputs, no distractions. Twenty to thirty minutes of staring at a wall. Sounds insane but that's when your brain processes everything you've learned and makes unexpected connections between ideas. The app ""Insight Timer"" has specific meditation tracks designed for this, not relaxation but active mind-wandering sessions. They've got practices from neuroscientists and cognitive researchers focused specifically on enhancing creative cognition through structured rest.

Another option worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI-powered audio learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert insights into personalized podcasts. Built by a team from Columbia University and Google, it pulls from sources like ""Peak"" and neuroscience research to create content tailored to specific goals, like ""develop deliberate practice habits as a busy professional."" You can customize the depth from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and adjust the voice to whatever keeps you engaged during commutes or workouts. It also builds adaptive learning plans based on what you highlight and how you interact with the content, making the whole process more structured and less overwhelming for lifelong learners.

**They collect failures obsessively** 

Most people hide their mistakes or minimize them. Smart people document them systematically. They keep failure journals where they analyze what went wrong, why their thinking was flawed, and what they'd do differently. Research from growth mindset psychology shows that people who explicitly process their failures develop better metacognition; they understand how they think and where their blind spots are. It's not about beating yourself up; it's a clinical analysis of your cognitive errors. The book ""Black Box Thinking"" by Matthew Syed examines this across industries. He's a former Olympic athlete turned journalist who spent years studying how different fields handle failure. Aviation learns from every crash, while healthcare often repeats fatal mistakes. The difference is systematic failure analysis. This book is genuinely eye-opening about how most of us are terrible at learning from mistakes because we don't examine them properly.

**They deliberately limit their options**

While everyone talks about keeping options open and staying flexible, research shows that too much choice can impair decision-making and cognitive performance. Smart people create constraints intentionally. They'll work at the same coffee shop every day, wear similar clothes, eat the same meals, and basically automate the trivial decisions so their cognitive resources aren't depleted by choice overload. Decision fatigue is real and backed by tons of research. Every choice you make, even tiny ones, drains mental energy. By reducing unnecessary decisions, smart people preserve their cognitive capacity for things that actually matter. It looks boring from the outside, but it's strategically intelligent.

The fascinating thing about all these habits is they go against common sense and social norms. We're taught to be comfortable, confident in our beliefs, avoid looking stupid, stay busy, hide failures, and maximize options. Smart people do the exact opposite in almost every case. And the research consistently shows that these counterintuitive approaches lead to better cognitive performance, more creativity, and stronger critical thinking skills.

Your brain is incredibly plastic, meaning it can change and develop throughout your life. Intelligence isn't fixed; it's built through specific behavioral patterns that most people never adopt because they seem weird or uncomfortable. But that's precisely why they work.",1,1769742511.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

I’m now a midlevel (3rd yr) in NYC and I still can’t shake the feeling of needing to be frugal. I’m not “cheap” per se, but like I don’t really go out of my way to spend money. I cook at home, buy groceries from the cheapest store (TJ’s, Lidl, Walmart etc) and don’t buy fancy clothes from the store itself. Like if I buy fancy clothes I’ll always get them off FB marketplace (or else not at all) bc I can’t fathom paying full price for a piece of clothing. I only wear a couple pairs of shoes and I don’t go on expensive vacations. Even for work I stick with the same 3-4 outfits and rotate them. 

Does anyone else feel like their frugal mentality never left them despite not needing to hold onto it? Now that I have a steady stream of $$$$, I almost feel less inclined to spend it on stuff that is fleeting. 

The only thing I don’t hold back on is spending for my parents/sibling. We never had enough money to get coffee or dessert or the occasional dinner from outside the house growing up, and so I love treating them to those experiences. But for myself? I get like no enjoyment or satisfaction from it. Not even in a self-pitying way. I’m just super content not spending anything. Just curious if it’s a low income background thing or if I’m just a bit dramatic LOL. ",23,1769742491.0,biglaw,11,0.87,False
1qqtseo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qqtseo/body_language_expert_stop_doing_this_or_people/,Body Language Expert: Stop Doing THIS or People Will Secretly Dislike You (Science-Backed Subtle Mistakes),"I used to wonder why some people just seemed *magnetic* while I felt invisible in social situations. Turns out, I was broadcasting ""stay away"" signals without even knowing it. After diving deep into research from body language experts, evolutionary psychology studies, and behavioral science (shoutout to Joe Navarro's work and Vanessa Van Edwards' podcast), I realized most of us are unknowingly sabotaging our likability. The craziest part? These aren't your fault. Our biology wired us for survival in caves, not boardrooms or coffee dates. But once you understand these patterns, you can actually rewire them.

Here's the thing that changed everything for me. **Crossed arms aren't always defensive**, everyone knows that one. The real killers are way more subtle. Like when you're talking to someone and your feet point toward the exit. Your mouth says ""I'm interested"" but your body screams ""I want to leave."" People pick up on this subconsciously and it makes them uncomfortable around you. I noticed I did this constantly at parties, literally standing with one foot already walking away. No wonder conversations felt so strained.

**The ""flash smile"" is another brutal one.** You know that quick smile that appears and disappears in under a second? It signals fake politeness. Real smiles take time to form and fade, they engage your whole face especially around the eyes. I started practicing this in front of a mirror and yeah, felt ridiculous. But genuine smiles completely changed how people responded to me. There's actual neuroscience behind this too. When you smile authentically, it triggers mirror neurons in other people's brains that make them feel good around you.

**Eye contact mistakes are huge but not how you think.** Too much eye contact makes you seem aggressive or intense. Too little makes you seem sketchy or insecure. The sweet spot? Hold eye contact for about 60-70% of the conversation, breaking away occasionally to prevent it from becoming a staring contest. I learned this from reading **What Every Body Is Saying by Joe Navarro**, former FBI counterintelligence officer. This book will make you question everything you think you know about reading people. Navarro spent decades catching spies by analyzing their nonverbal cues. He breaks down exactly which signals mean comfort versus discomfort, and trust me, you've been misreading people your whole life. The section on how to establish genuine rapport through body language is insanely good. It's not some pseudoscience garbage, it's based on actual behavioral analysis from interrogations and field work.

If you want to go even deeper into communication psychology without committing hours to reading, BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from sources like Navarro's work, communication research, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content. You can customize a learning plan around something specific like ""become more magnetic in conversations as an introvert"" and it'll generate podcasts tailored to your exact situation. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Plus you can pick voices that actually keep you engaged, some people swear by the smoky, conversational tone that makes complex psychology feel like chatting with a friend.

Want to practice this stuff in real time? The **Slowly app** is weirdly perfect for this. It's a pen pal app where messages take hours or days to arrive, mimicking old school letter writing. Sounds random but hear me out. It forces you to be more intentional with communication and think about how you present yourself, which carries over to in person interactions. You end up practicing thoughtful, authentic expression without the pressure of face to face stakes.

**Fidgeting and self touching are death sentences for credibility.** Touching your face, playing with your hair, picking at your nails. These are called ""adaptors"" in body language research and they signal anxiety or dishonesty. Even if you're telling the truth, people will doubt you. I had this horrible habit of touching my neck during stressful conversations. Started forcing my hands to stay visible and relaxed, palms occasionally open. It felt weird at first but people started trusting me more in meetings and dates.

**Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this on her Science of People podcast**, and she has this whole framework about ""power body language"" versus ""submissive body language."" Taking up space (without being obnoxious), keeping your head level instead of tilted, using hand gestures that stay within your ""strike zone"" (the space between your shoulders and waist). All of this subconsciously communicates confidence. Her episode on charisma equations genuinely changed how I show up in rooms. She interviews researchers and breaks down studies in ways that are actually useful, not just theoretical nonsense.

The **mirroring technique** is powerful but you have to be subtle. When someone leans in, you lean in a few seconds later. They cross their legs, you adjust your posture similarly. This creates subconscious rapport because it signals ""we're on the same wavelength."" But do it too obviously and you look like a creep. I practiced this during low stakes conversations like chatting with baristas or coworkers. After a while it became natural and I noticed people seemed more comfortable opening up to me.

**Your handshake matters more than you think.** Research from the University of Alabama found that handshakes can predict personality traits and hiring decisions. Too weak screams insecurity. Too strong screams overcompensation. The ideal is firm, brief (2-3 seconds), with full palm contact and one or two pumps. Match the other person's pressure. And for the love of god, make sure your hands aren't sweaty or cold. Keep hand sanitizer or wash them before important meetings.

Here's something nobody talks about. **The distance you stand from people unconsciously affects how they feel about you.** Personal space varies by culture but in most Western contexts, standing closer than 18 inches feels invasive unless you're intimate. Standing too far (more than 4 feet) seems cold or disinterested. I used to stand way too far from people because I was anxious about invading their space. Turned out it made me seem aloof and unfriendly. Finding that middle zone completely changed my social interactions.

**Nodding while listening seems basic but most people do it wrong.** Quick, repetitive nodding signals impatience like you want them to hurry up. Slow, occasional nods show genuine engagement. I started being way more conscious of this during conversations and people literally started saying things like ""you're such a good listener"" when all I changed was my nodding pattern.

Bottom line is this. Your body is constantly broadcasting signals that others pick up on instinctively. Most of these patterns developed when humans lived in small tribes and needed to quickly assess threats or allies. We're not in that environment anymore but our brains still process these cues. The good news is neuroplasticity means you can retrain these habits. It takes consistent practice but once you start noticing how people respond differently to you, it becomes addictive. You're not learning to be fake, you're learning to let your genuine intentions actually come through instead of being blocked by anxious body language your nervous system defaulted to.",1,1769742380.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False
1qqtq5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qqtq5h/worst_mother_in_law_of_all_time/,Worst Mother in Law of all time.,"My wife’s mother might actually be the worst human being of all time. She is the definition of weaponized incompetence. My in laws have had a very bad relationship and are only together for taxes. They live in Washington (father) and in northern Virginia (mother) and they still fight all day everyday. My wife had neck surgery due to a work incident and her mother has been staying with us. 

Her mother has been the biggest slob I have ever seen in my life. She brought chocolate covered pretzels, but she only eats the chocolate covered side and then throws the pretzels across the room so the maid (me) can come pick them up. She hides yogurts under the couch so she can eat them for later and has been using the same spoon for 3 weeks. She doesn’t know how to wash dishes. She just rinses them and wipes them off with the same rag for 3 weeks and then puts the dirty dishes back. I have been just cleaning things before I use them now. She doesn’t know how to make coffee, but insists on making it every morning so all of our coffees end up filled with grinds. On top of this, I leave at 6 am and get home by 7:30-8, the coffee creamer will still be sitting on the counter all night. She makes smoothies, doesn’t clean them out only rinses it, and then screws the blender shut so mold can grow inside. That is the only thing she closes, just the blender top when it’s wet and I had to clean mold out of it. She leaves sauces open, cheese, her leftovers open and sideways so it’s spills all over my fridge and gets soy sauce into the Brita filter. She watched me and my wife mixing up a cake, so she preheated the oven for us, forgetting that she put the brand new pans she got us with plastic handles in the oven so those went up in smoke. She made my wife move her car in a snowstorm because “she’s too scared to drive the truck” (I work for the government and I was doing overtime for the snowstorm, wasn’t home for 3 days). She leaves the front door wide open to walk the dog, in the middle of upstate NY winter while it’s 6° outside. She also has to wear her shoes inside because “she feels too short”, but she doesn’t kick off her feet from the salt and snow outside. She never locks the bathroom door and thinks it’s funny when people walk in on her. She has been quite literally defecating on the toilet seat, and then not cleaning it up. She wipes poop all over our walls and our doors from her fingers on the way out from the bathroom. She doesn’t drink more than a waterbottle a day, she only drinks mug root beer. She coughs all day long and says it’s from our heater. She will go out to smoke a cigarette at night, leave the front door open so our house smells like cigarettes then come in and leave the door unlocked, (we’re not in a nice area). She will cough for 20 minutes straight while spitting at the wall in back of the couch. While we’re at the couch, she also recently picked up using zyns and has been sticking them to the back of our brand new pullout couch. 

Her dog is a 100lb English lab that is the worst trained dog I’ve ever seen. It barks nonstop at anything and licks everything in my apartment. She also trained the dog to jump up on you while you’re eating so “we can all eat together”. We have to lay sheets down everywhere because the dog is so fat it literally has a medically large butthole and cannot hold in it’s poop. She also has it on such a bad diet that the dogs poop is slimey. I know that because she continually comes back in from walks saying how she’s so surprised pepper didn’t have to poop (because the walk only lasts for the duration of her cigarette) only for her to shit front and center on our rug. She also comes back in the apartment two days ago and says “I really have to start picking up after the dog one of your neighbors said something to me today”. WHAT. Yeah she’s been letting the dog shit all over the neighborhood. I had to talk to her about waking the dog because when she first came here she would just open the door and say go. We’re in a city and the dog has never been here before. what do you know, we had to go searching for the dog every single time and she was surprised that the dog wouldn’t just come to her calls. The dogs nails are so long and so discolored, it’s definitely in pain and she won’t let anyone touch her paws but my mother in law says that that’s normal behavior and I just want to label everything as a problem. All of this and she still blames me if I have to get up and go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and the dog will walk around the apartment barking until someone turns the lights on.

MIL didn’t check the propane in their main house right outside of Philly before leaving. She also got in an argument with the people that plow her driveway. So no driveway plow = no propane truck = no heat. The cat has been staying there alone except for a caregiver for two years, I didn’t know that. But now the cat is in a freezing house, the caregiver took the cat because her water was frozen and my MIL has been waiting for 2 days and is going to wait until tomorrow to get her back. And she said “I don’t even feel bad about her taking the cat” and saying how she’s going to call the cops to get it back. We thought the cat was with her in NOVA this whole time and now my wife wants me to drive 7 hours to Philly and 7 hours back to bring the cat back which is going to cost us our security deposit plus the cat claws at furniture and toes when you’re trying to sleep. 

I work 12 hour shifts 5-6 days a week and I have to come back to my apartment more disgusting than my frat house at boulder. I say disgusting not messy because things aren’t messy here, she’s making it genuinely gross. 

Does anyone have any advice to give me? I’m genuinely going to freak out so badly and I don’t know what to do. I’m dealing with a literal grown baby that has zero responsibility, accountability or embarrassment.",2,1769742214.0,Advice,11,1.0,False
1qqtpkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qqtpkj/the_sins_of_the_father/,The Sins of the Father,"You think you know your family. What they look like, how they speak, how it feels when they pat you on the back and say ‘welcome home’. None of us truly know any other person; not completely, often not in the ways that matter. I thought I knew my family, but I didn’t. I was a fool with wool over my eyes. I’d been living in a fantasy which was seconds away from crumbling down around me at every turn throughout my falsehood of a childhood. This is the story of how I learned what my family really was. What we really are. Maybe it can help you, too, or maybe I’m just looking to vent to the only corner of the internet who’ll really understand. Believe it or not, I don’t really care, I just need you to read. I need this after the weekend I just had.

It was this past Saturday that it started. The air was cold as I walked up the drive leading to my childhood home. I hadn’t visited in years; work in the city had kept me too busy. We lived out in the country, so I didn’t often get to come out and see my family. Mum always said that I was too absorbed in my work for my own good, and she was right. I finally got the chance to get away for the weekend, though, and got on the train as quickly as Mum could shout it at me on the phone. That afternoon, there I was, listening to the crunch and crackle of the gravel as I walked up the driveway with my pack of clothes slowly shifting at my back. I took in the sight for a moment and walked up to the front door to knock.

Seconds after I knocked, the door swung open with enough force to blow my hair back. Mum was there, holding the door open and looking at me with a wide smile. I felt a swell of emotion in my chest and brought her in for a hug. We stood in the doorway for a few moments, just holding one another, but voices from inside drew my attention further into the house, to where I saw my brother, Joshua, sticking his head out from behind a wall to see what was going on. He was younger than me, all bones and no meat, and he looked near-exactly the same as when I’d last seen him in person a number of years ago. He had longer hair, but it was the same boyish face under there, and I gave him a smile that he replied to with a middle-finger. As you can tell, we loved each other greatly.

I was brought into the house then. Stepping into the hallway felt like a dream; I suddenly felt ten years younger, like I was coming home from a long day at school rather than returning after years. It felt like I was waking up from a lengthy and restful nap. Making my way through the home was stranger than even that, as in each room I entered, I felt like I was simultaneously at home again, and also a stranger, an alien in my own life. Everything was precisely as it had been the last I saw of it, but it was so undeniably foreign to me now that I felt myself torn in two, part of me feeling joy at revisiting the memories of my childhood, and the other part of myself feeling a deep ache in my chest at those same memories. I was still so far away from this house, still trying to catch up to my own sense of nostalgia.

Next, I was brought into the living room where everybody currently at home was gathered for a few drinks. All of us kids were adults now, and Dad was always one to sort things out over a good drink, so I wasn’t surprised that everyone had already cracked open a few, even if it was still early afternoon. The room lit up when I entered, and it gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling in my chest to see it. I sat down and looked everyone over to familiarise myself with how they looked.

My other brother, Daniel, also younger than me, was still the lanky runner he’d been in high school. My only sister, Rachel, was the only one to take after Mum, both in looks and in attitude, as she was chatting away with everyone on the couch as she waved at me across the room. I paused for a moment, and realised that my father wasn’t in the room. In fact, he was nowhere to be seen at all, even as I peered down the hall toward the bedrooms. We’d never been especially close, but I had been looking forward to seeing him after all this time away. He worked a lot when I was young, always travelling to different places, and so I was never really connected to him the way I was to my mum. It was a shame he didn’t come to see me that night, but I could live with that. I had before, and I probably would for the rest of my life. I tried a smile for my siblings, which was returned with much more enthusiasm than I truly felt. I took a deep breath in and stepped over to an unoccupied seat, feeling a sinking in my stomach, but ignored it and began to catch up with my siblings.

We spoke for hours. As it turned out, my father was sick in bed, and couldn’t come out to see everyone. He’d caught some illness that Mum couldn’t explain, but it was very contagious. The doctor she got to look at him had contracted it, too, and was bedridden also, so there wasn’t a chance she was letting any of us see him. She barely went in there, and every time she did, it apparently was with a nurse that she’d hired. I felt bad for my dad, but put my energy toward keeping up with the conversation taking place in front of me.

I wasn’t much of a drinker, but I had a few of my dad’s cheap beers, and was tipsy after a long while of sipping on it between long-winded explanations of what was going on with my work. We made dinner an hour or two after I arrived, everyone working together to make one of Mum’s stir fry dishes. Dinner was marvellous, and as the sun set and we became tired from our collective travels and efforts with dinner and the long stretch of conversation, it was time for some of us, especially those of us who weren’t so accustomed to alcohol, to sleep.

I was among them, as I was the oldest yet the least used to drinking, and even my youngest sibling, Rachel, had more of a tolerance for it than I had at just nineteen years old. I was twenty-six, Daniel was twenty-four, and Joshua was twenty-one. I got some teasing from my siblings about this, but I brushed it off easily enough. Soon, everyone was going off to their separate rooms to sleep, and I was about to join them in rest, but a hand fell on my shoulder as I was about to enter the room I’d be sleeping in.

I turned to see my father, gently holding me in place and giving me a deadly serious look. I immediately took note of how he could barely stand by himself. It seemed to me that keeping me there was only half the reason he was grasping my shoulder, as he almost seemed to sway slightly in place as I waited for an explanation. In the silent moment that followed, I examined his face closely now. He was pale, far paler than I ever remembered him being. He was almost half his usual height with how far down he had to bend, seemingly for comfort.

He was looking up at me, which had never happened before, and I questioned in that split-second of quiet if I was truly looking at the man who’d done half the job of raising me, or if I was looking at another person entirely, weak and feeble and old. That was really the thing that stood out to me the most, how old he looked. He’d never truly acted his age, always having get togethers and drinking sessions as if his middle-aged body could handle the same amount of alcohol as his twenty year old self could. He looked at me through sunken eyes and grimaced, an expression which forced me to do the same.

“Wait up,” he said, the first thing he’d said directly to me all night. His voice was hoarse, seemingly from disuse from the sound of it.

I didn’t say anything back. I found myself unable to say anything with how hard my heart was beating, so hard I thought it might leap up out of my throat and escape my body. He was supposed to be sick, bedridden, but here he was, touching and interacting with me as if he weren’t. Did this mean it was safe to see him? I had no clue, but I simply nodded and turned around to walk back over to the couches I’d spent the whole night sitting in, talking to everyone else. I sat down while wondering what this could be about. We hadn’t had a real conversation in years. Mum and I spoke often, every week or so, but the lengthiest conversation I’d ever had with my dad about what was going on in my life was when I was seven and joined the soccer team he’d pushed me to join and he just gave me a clap on the back and taken another swig of his drink. I had no way of knowing what he wanted to talk about; I was shocked that he wanted to talk at all! I sat down and waited for Dad to talk first, knowing at the least that he had something he wanted to say, and clearly it was important enough to get out of bed to say it to me, despite being supposedly ill.

He hobbled over to the couch and agonisingly plopped down into it. It seemed as though every little movement pained him. He sat on the couch for a moment before speaking, taking some time to simply breathe hard as he rested after the herculean effort of walking to the living room. I studied him during these few seconds, noticing that he looked even more different from my memory of him than I’d clocked from my previous close-up look at him mere moments ago. The hair on his head had almost entirely vanished, a few wisps at his temples the only remaining vestige of his youthful mane.

He was nursing a drink in his hand, something other than his usual beer, which meant it was probably medicine. When he winced, the teeth that peeked through his lips were yellowed and rotted, as if he hadn’t brushed them in decades. That was strange, as he’d been the picture of health for his age when I’d last seen him but a few years ago. How could he deteriorate so fast? What had happened to him? At last, he seemed to gather the strength to speak.

“Hey,” he said simply.

“Hey. Are you okay?” I asked.

“Yes. No. Depends on the weather,” he joked. He was never too concerned about it, but being in this state ought to have made him a little bit more aware of his health, right? Apparently not. When he laughed, it sounded like a balloon being deflated as he hissed out a prolonged, pained giggle at his own unfunny joke.

“Be serious. Mum said you’re sick,” I said.

“Yeah, she would’a. I’m not picture perfect, but I never have been, so it’s nothing for her to worry about,” he said in a wheezing rasp that had me wincing in second-hand pain.

“She also said you got someone else sick with the same thing,” I admitted. “Must be a little bit worrisome.”

Dad looked at me with a grave expression on his face, which was paler than moonlight. He shifted in his seat a bit, and a loud pop came from his side of the room, accompanied by a strangled grunt of pain from him. I moved to stand, but he held a hand out to me and just trembled in place for a while as he came down from the pain. I saw the savage look in his eyes as they filled with hurt and pain that I couldn’t even begin to relate to. I don’t think I’d ever seen someone in quite as much agony as I was seeing my father in at that moment, and I don’t think I’ll ever see anything like it again, knowing what was to come.

“What’s wrong with you? No jokes, please,” I asked.

“Might as well. If it’ll be any of ya, it’ll be you,” he said, waving a lazy finger at me.

“What do you mean?” I asked again.

“Well, this’ll take some explaining,” Dad said. He lifted an arm up and out towards me. “Help me up.”

I stood, took a few steps, and I was upon him in no time. I grasped his hand in mine and pulled upwards, lifting him easily. He was thin as a rake under those baggy clothes, light as a feather; so thin I thought I’d snap his wrist if I pulled any harder. Jerkily, he got to his feet and groaned as pain seemingly flared up once again. Once he was settled on his feet, Dad began to walk, motioning for me to join him.

We walked down the hall silently, not a word passing between us. We reached the back door soon enough, and we stepped out onto the patio where the clear, chill night air awaited us. Dad sat in a chair that had a lot of give, a chair that I didn’t remember. They must’ve gotten it for his comfort after he’d fallen ill. I sat opposite him, in a chair that had a small cup holder on the arm, still sporting a flat cola. I gave him a look that begged to explain, and he did.

“D’you remember how I used to travel?” he asked me.

“For work, yeah?” I asked in return, not seeing where he was going.

“Yeah, work, well you’re half right. It was for something, but it wasn’t work,” Dad said with another scowl.

“You lied?” I asked him. So it was going to be one of those talks, the kind where you sit down for a quick chat with your dad and have your entire childhood recontextualised by a single off-hand remark. Joyous joy.

“I did. Oh, don’t look at me like that,” he snapped, waving a hand at me. “Your mum knew what I was doing every day I wasn’t with her, and I didn’t enjoy it, but it worked.”

“What worked?”

“Right, right,” he said with a hazy quality about him. It seemed he was losing lucidity. “Well, boy, I guess you could say that my dad was unlucky. Ran into some big opportunities, but also big risks, and took ‘em all in stride. Even curses and consequences he took onto himself without a care in the world for how it’d impact him in the future; and curses he took. He’d run afoul of quite a bit of people in his youth, and one of them fancied herself a witch.”

“Wait, wait, wait … you’ve got to be kidding,” I said, laughing at the ridiculousness of where I thought he was going with this.

“Shut up and listen, boy. No jokes,” he said, parroting my own plea for serious consideration back at me. I looked at him and barked out a laugh again, but didn’t move to leave or talk against him any further.

“This witch, as she liked to call herself — my dad screwed her over, real bad. She lost her job because of him, though I’ll never know how. She thought she was owed, she wanted something from him, but he never gave her a single cent of reparations. She was left to get bitter and angry, and then she appeared one day, years later, and saw my dad with me, and said—” Dad continued, but he cut himself off.

My father lurched violently, spilling out from his chair and onto the cold pavement below him. I stood to catch him, but I was too late, as he fell on his face and sprawled on the tiled patio with a painful looking scrape of his face along the ground. I moved to help him up, but was held back by a swipe from his hand, which caught me on the forearm and caused three lines of searing pain to erupt on my skin. I watched as his nails scratched across my forearm and sliced deep into the flesh, a gush of ruby red blood oozing out of the gouges in my skin and muscles. I pulled my arm back with a cry of pain, my voice breaking as I screamed. I stumbled back and tripped over myself, falling on my ass as my father laid helpless on the ground across from me.

The hand that cut me came down and pushed on the ground, and I got a good look at it for the first time since he’d put it on my shoulder those minutes ago. It had changed, with deep, inky black veins showing through the skin, bulging up and travelling up his arm until they disappeared under his shirt sleeve. The nails had transformed from regular, white keratin to faded yellow blades that protruded from his fingertips, as though he had sprouted the claws of a beast. The hot crimson blood poured from my arm and down onto my lower body as I was struck with a fear that paralysed me, ice cold fear gripping me and forcing me to give in to panic.

My father looked up at me as he pushed himself up with that one deformed arm, and yellow eyes peered back at mine as I took in what had happened. The entire left side of his face was red and was dripping with thick, dark blood, darker than I could ever imagine blood being. It oozed out as if it were old and congealed, running down his face in coagulated globs rather than in hasty rivulets, like mine was flowing from my own injury. We sat and looked at each other as we were, both injured and bleeding on the ground and neither, seemingly, sure where to go from there.

“She said …” Dad said through the agony clear in his broken, raw voice, “… that the sins of the father shall be passed onto the son as if he himself were wicked.”

“What the fuck?” I half-whispered, too baffled to even scream.

“She cursed me, boy. She cursed me to live with the sins of my father on my shoulders, always bearing down on me so that we’d both know it was his fault I’m like this!” he explained.

“That can’t be true. Why are you telling me this?” I asked, trying to stop my injured arm from shaking.

“Sins of the father, boy! It’s a curse on the family!” Dad yelled quickly, no longer trying to be quiet.

I felt a sinking sensation in my chest as I realised what he must have meant. It was hereditary, that had to be what he was saying. Suddenly, the pain in my arm went numb in a cold way as my breathing picked up and I began to panic in earnest. I couldn’t deny what I was seeing anymore; my father was cursed and I was as well. The only question that remained in my mind was what the curse actually did, but I soon got a clue in the form of my father’s affliction accelerating, seemingly worsening before my very eyes.

Unless my eyes deceived me, the shoulder of Dad’s right arm, the arm that had been growing more and more monstrous this whole time, popped out of its socket and hung limply at his side. He howled in pain as his arm was further jerked upwards, seemingly against his will. He lifted his dislocated arm up and the same occurred to his elbow, the joint tearing itself as his arm elongated and stretched to inhuman proportions. The pitch black veins spread across his skin, consuming the entirety of his visible arm and beginning to crawl up his neck and face on the half opposite the one he’d skinned.

His fingers then flexed themselves out of their sockets, displacing themselves with a series of dull cracks and pops of flesh and bone tearing themselves apart to warp this way. I simply watched with my jaw dropped as my father became something else before me, sprawled out on the patio and writhing in blinding agony. He called out weakly, pitifully, and looked me in the eyes with that yellow gaze he now possessed.

“It comes in waves! You can’t keep it from happening, but you can hide yourself, keep others from finding you when you’ve changed! I thought I’d have more time to explain it all, but now’s the time. You’ve got to kill me! Now, before I change completely!” Dad yelled, screaming bloody murder as his other arm began to twist, bend and pop its own joints out of place.

“I can’t!” I sobbed.

“You can! There’s a—AGH!” Dad tried to say, but couldn’t before he lurched again.

His leg jerked out, probably on instinct, as the curse began to spread to it. The reflexive kick was powerful enough to send the glass coffee table we’d talked over flying, and glass shards sprinkling over the both of us when it shattered against the brick wall of the house.

I shielded my face from the volley of glass, and when I dropped my good arm and saw what had become of the formerly sturdy table, I understood what needed to happen. This thing my father was becoming would be a danger to our family if this curse was left to turn my father into some creature. None of us would be able to stop him from killing us if he turned completely. He was right, he needed to be ended now, before he became a real problem later.

I took a look at my injured arm. The bleeding had slowed down, but it was still pulsing with blood every few seconds. It didn’t hurt anymore, though, now that pain had given way to terror and panic. I was on an adrenaline rush that kept me from really feeling what was probably a devastating injury, which I could confirm for myself as I realised that I couldn’t actually move my arm below the elbow; it was paralysed as if by magic. I supposed it was magic that had done this to me.

Standing up was a mighty task. I felt a rush surge to my head and I became lightheaded as I rose to my feet. I looked down at my father and saw that all four of his limbs had become mangled, bloodied tangles of flesh, the joints bent out of shape and the skin ripped and torn so that they were all jagged, broken strips of flesh painted maroon by dark, thick red liquid.

He was looking up at the sky, and although there was a roof over the patio, I doubted he saw it. He almost looked dead, but I knew he was still alive as I could hear his haggard, shallow, wet hacking and coughing as he took his last breaths. The death rattles rang out in the silent night air as I stumbled closer to his broken body, which would surely begin to move again soon. My arm hung at my side as I leaned towards him and took my own deep gulps of air to gain my breath back.

“How do I do it?” I asked, my voice eerily steady.

“I have a gun. Please,” he begged. His words were slurred as he coughed up blood.

I haltingly crept closer to his body, and found that the limbs did not stray out and strike me. This curse, whatever it truly did to my father, must have finally completely broken his body. I used my one good hand to search the pockets of my dad’s clothing, and eventually found a pistol stuffed down his baggy nightgown. I pulled it out and knew it was probably loaded and ready to go. He’d planned this. I took a deep, clear breath, and looked my father in the eye as I stood over him.

His yellowed eyes slowly drifted over and locked onto mine. I felt bile push up my throat, and I wanted to throw up, but I held it back and pointed the gun at my father’s head. I knelt down, not confident that I’d get it right from any distance, and pressed the barrel to Dad’s chin, angled so that it would tear right through his head. We met eyes once again, and he gave me a look that made me feel guilty. This wasn’t right, but this was his, our lot. I felt the need to say something, but whatever had been holding it back broke, and I began to sob and cry at the task set before me.

“Do it,” he said with his final bit of life.

I knew I had to do it, as I got startled when one of his legs jerked. He was starting to move again, and if he could cut me and flip that table with his frail body, then what could he do to the rest of our family? I let my feelings show on my face, openly weeping to my father as I held a gun to his head. I nodded as his arm twitched, his hand closing in a fist, and knew it was time. I put my finger on the trigger and looked back at my dad’s face.

He was entirely consumed by the curse. There wasn’t a patch of natural, pink skin in sight. My father was an inky black thing, a creature born to kill and maim, but I could put a stop to it if I just moved my finger a fraction of an inch towards myself. I took one last look into my father’s eyes as his yellow irises focused back on me, but it was different this time. He wasn’t looking up, at peace with himself, he wasn’t looking at me, regretting that it had come to this. No, he was looking at me with a need in his eyes, a hunger.

I closed my eyes.

BANG.

It was done.

I don’t know how long I sat there, eyes closed, fists clenched, crying so hard I thought I would faint. Eventually, whether it was seconds, minutes or hours, the noise of what had happened seemed to have woken the others up, and they emerged from the house and onto the patio to find me crouched over a mess of tangled flesh and bones with a gun in my hand, sobbing so loudly that I hadn’t heard them come.

Mum’s hand on my shoulders snapped me out of it, and I spun around in a panicked frenzy, so fast I slipped on the bloody patio floor and tumbled to the ground, dropping the gun. I looked up at them, and saw that all my siblings were looking horrified at Dad, crying and trying to keep the others from seeing what had become of his body. Mum, though, was at my side, as if I was the one that needed to be reassured. I’d been reassured, and I still didn’t feel any better. I spent that night silently, not saying a single word to a single person as Mum went on to explain things to my brothers and sister.

They understood quicker than I had, mostly because of the cursed corpse on the patio, but they were still shaken, and nobody said much over the next few days. I requested a week off work to stay around while my arm gets better and we figure out how to bury Dad and how to deal with my curse when it shows itself. I still don’t completely understand it, but I don’t think anyone does, and that gives me some solace in this time of confusion and doubt.

I’ve been feeling different these past few days. I know it’s the curse. It’s creeping up on me and I can feel it, day by day, getting stronger. I’ll have to make arrangements to hide myself away while it works its magic.

It was once said that the sins of the father shall be passed onto the son as if he himself were wicked, but that’s not true. I’m not wicked. My father wasn’t wicked. Those who punish the son for the father’s sins, they’re the wicked ones. People think they know how the world works, they think they’re right, and they think they know those around them, but they don’t know any of those things. They just hope they’re right and do the exact same thing they’d do if they knew they were wrong. That’s the way of the world.

v2.13.0b2

It works great basically three versions above 2.12.2, If you want to know all the changes done in this beta go to the stock bitaxe github

When 2.13 comes out of beta I will update this post for the full version of that. 

No more low power input or asic voltage/temp not showing,this works just like 2.12.0 and every other version you found that work, including tch versions (but they're running on older base firmware)


Beta 3 just came out but there's only two small changes The file I'm posting is the newest file in version of available for the GT800xxx
Personally edited ,fixed and compiled by a group of us who believe we shouldn't be punished just because we bought a unit that was for sale off of public information they posted, they should have posted that we shouldn't buy it because it may not be supported in the future because it is a development board instead they create a whole other unit called the ""801"", which is the exact same except one to chip is multi stack  aka strapless and the xxx models have a single stack chip.


The only error you will have will be at the top of the page saying that the firmware version don't match, because I haven't figured out how to change the firmware numbers during compile because I'm not the person compiling it. If you're okay with that which causes no issue go for it you can always go back to your older versions if you're worried or something or just don't use it at all up to you. 

This is for those of us who want all the new features and revisions without having to buy a ""new"" device (801)


Run it ​if you guys want , If you guys want to have all the features of 2.12.2 and beyond to the latest available beta, this is for you any of those that are stuck on the dirty versions this is for you. 


Don't be stuck with crappy old firmware because of OSMU vs  and lack of communication.

Apologies in advance if this post seems disorganized, my head is still reeling from all this. 9 years ago ( I was 18 then) my older sister eloped with her then boyfriend. Our parents (we're an immigrant family) were vehemently opposed to her relationship, I remember me being ok with it personally, it wasn't my place. She eloped with her boyfriend and cut of all contact with us. My parents were besides themselves. I tried reaching out to her back then on different platforms but was blocked. I even reached out to her best friends and asked them if they could at least get me in touch with her, they said she didn't know where she lived now, but that she'd told them she was happy. She had also left her workplace. Eventually we all (me and my parents) came to like an unspoken agreement to pretend she was never here, and I blocked her everywhere too. I remember being extra particular to call regularly when I was in college because I was worried about their state of mind. We're now at a place where I can't remember the last time she crossed our minds.

Yesterday my sister knocked on my apartment door. She cried and hugged me when she saw me, I hugged her back initially too, I wasn't really thinking at the time. She was just going on about how much I had changed, how much she'd missed me all these years. Eventually I kind of remembered everything, and asked her why she was here, and who had given her my address. She said she had swore to them that she wouldnt tell. I asked her why didn't she call first since whoever gave my address probably gave my number too, she said she just wanted to see me in person. I told her we'd gotten over her, why was she here. She said her issue had only been with our parents, not me, I told her about how I'd been blocked too by her when she left. She told me she was sorry she'd hurt me, but she had wanted a fresh start, told me I was an uncle to a nephew and a niece (they weren't there at the time, they were at their father's, they recently divorced). She acted surprised that I wouldn't know, said she'd told someone to tell our parents about them.

Maybe it was hearing about the divorce that furstrated me more, because if we were going to have gone through all this pain, at least she could've found lasting happiness, I just told her she was a stranger to me now. She said we could have lunch together she wanted to know all about what I'd been up to, I told her it was best if we continued to have no contact, she didn't act like an older sister when I needed her to, and that we were no longer family, we'd mourned her already and we were now strangers. She was tearful, she gave me her address and phone number and left.

Last night, I spoke to my girlfriend about what had happened. She said she was still my sister, that I shouldn't have just turned her away. I told her she didnt know what we'd gone through in the days after she had eloped. But I still wanted to know here AITA?

**Relevant Comments:**

**Comment 1:**

I have a sister that I have had zero interaction with for more than 30 years. She reached out to me after our mother's death in 2018. We just went different paths in life. I have zero in common with her other than sharing a bio mother. I wished her well in life but told her no that that ship had sailed. Obviously she threw a fit which just confirmed my no.

What your sister did was unfair to you. Makes me wonder if he was controlling her or if this is who she is. NTA

**Comment 2:**

NTA

You are exactly right in what you said and how you feel about this.

The issue here is that she’s only returned because a significant part of her life changed. It wasn’t a change of mind or heart, just circumstances.

And she still managed to trample over and ignore any feelings or emotions you may have about her sudden reappearance.

Never say never but for now I would definitely continue a life without this person’s involvement and any contact is up to you and no-one else.

**Comment 3:**

NTA. She broke all contact with you for nearly a decade. She treated you as if you were disposable. There is no relationship to salvage. She doesn’t get to unilaterally decide to pick you up again just because it works for her.

I’m guessing she’s decided now’s a good time because she’s getting divorced and in essence needs something (time, attention, connection) from you. Ask yourself, if she weren’t getting divorced, would she have reached out?

You need to figure out who shared your address with her.

**OP:**

I hadnt thought of this and I've been feeling sick thinking this might be true since I read this. That she wouldn't have ever reached out if she hadnt gotten divorced. Would've been fine without ever seeing me again. Although she didn't ask for anything material during our interaction I guess, she wanted lunch, she thought after 9 years of almost forgetting I had a sister, id be ok with lunch.

**Comment 4 (downvoted):**

Keep in mind that she might have cut you off because she was scared you would tell your parents anything that she told you.

**OP:**

No. We had covered for each other so often when I was young. She had covered for me too. There was stuff that I could only tell her. That could not have been a real fear. I'd even told her friends that I wouldn't tell our parents but at least ask her to meet up with me. I'm sorry if I sound pointed but I haven't had to remember all the bs I went through in the aftermath of her elopement in a while and its just crazy how she just ditched us all. I don't think I can see her, I'd been thinking about it, but meeting her just means everything she put us through was fine, I remember how I felt at that time, and I can't let it go.

**Comment 5:**

OP, I wonder if her bf turned husband made her block you all? Could it be that getting away from him might be why she was able to reach out?

**OP:**

I dont know. Back then she would vouch for him a lot in front of our parents who really thought he was bad news, so idk, she seemed like it was all of her own volition.

**Comment 6:**

Absolutely NTA. When will people start accepting the consequences to their actions? And why do other people think they can tell you how you should have responded to her?? Your girlfriend should have kept her mouth shut and just held you and let you talk and been there for you. I wouldn’t tell your parents you saw her either. That’s a bandaid you don’t want to rip off.

**OP:**

I wont be telling my parents. If she reached out to me, she can reach out to them the same way, though she told me she wont be doing it, she'd only reached out to me.

**Comment 7:**

NTA but that's a tough situation to be in 

Just out of curiosity, why didnt the family accept her then bf? Cultural? Religious? Age?

**OP:**

They just didn't think he would make a good partner I think, she'd be vouching for him, and they (particularly my mom) would be telling her that essentially he's only interested in sex to put it crudely. There may have been other subconscious reasons possibly idk, but at least when they talked about it they would only bring up that he was bad news and that they were looking out for her.

**Comment 8:**

What is it that you want to achieve? This is crucial to answering the question. 

**OP:**

I dont know. I really had internalized that I'd never see her again. I remember the hurt I had felt at the time. I dont want to lose my headspace and I don't want to act like everything I went through was ok, that it shouldn't have any meaning or consequences. And ofcourse I want her and her kids to be safe and happy too.

**Comment 9:**

Did she even apologise? Or did she do the classic, it's such a long time ago you should be over it by now move? If there's no sincerity, there's no trust that she won't ghost you again. She owes you a full and frank conversation about what happened, her actions, her motivations and why she continued to block you. Without that you really have nothing to work with. Good luck.

**OP:**

She did apologize, she said she was sorry that she had cut me off, that she never meant for us to lose touch, her beef was with our parents only. I brought up that she blocked me everywhere, and she was just sobbing and apologizing. I also remember me begging her best friends for info and them saying they had no idea, which Ive always suspected was them lying because she asked them to.

Hi. Thanks a lot to everyone for the support in my post. And to those who reached out for support. I'd been emotionally drained almost after meeting my sister. Like I said I had made my peace, after a lot of hurt and futile hope, that I would never see her again.

She had my number, and I hadn't blocked the new number of hers. I'd thought about it, and received advice to, but I just didn't, it slipped from my mind. She asked me on Tuesday how I was doing, and asked if we could meet on Wednesday, she really wanted me to meet her kids. I was really conflicted, I didn't want to oblige her, but I decided to say yes to at least meet them.

I went to her apartment yesterday and met my niece and nephew. My niece had recently turned 9 and my nephew is 6. They're great kids and I really enjoyed seeing them. I remember feeling a certain way when my sister was introducing me and she told him, that the way he's my niece's younger brother, similarly I'm her younger brother. We talked a bit, and started talking about stories from us growing up. I hadn’t and still haven't said everything's ok between us, but our stories and conversation went smoothly. I learned that after she eloped and got married she had moved in with her husband into his place in a town a few hours away from us. That around 2019 they had had moved to the city we were currently in (according to her she didn't know all this time that I later moved here for work after college too). I told her about what I'd been up to all these years, my college, my job, my girlfriend etc.

After that, the kids were in their room and my sister brought up us all doing something again over the weekend. I told her we werent ok, she can't expect me to forget everything. She said she was sorry that her moving out had nothing to do with me, that she missed me. I was angry at the fact that she had no idea the pain I'd gone through both personally and then having to be the crutch for my parents pain. I told her I didn't believe her that she would've been perfectly fine with never seeing me again if she hadnt gotten divorced, that I could've been dead and she probably wouldnt have broken a sweat upon learning it since she was so blissed out from her domestic life. I know it was ugly, I've never said anything like this but in that moment I just wanted her to feel some kind of hurt of the kind she'd given me. She broke down and said I can hate her if I want but to just not hate her forever, there has to be a limit. I regretted saying what I said when I saw her crying so I just sat next to her and asked about why they'd divorced.

She told me that their life had been going alright the first few years. She said she'd even sent word through a mutual when the kids were born (which either the mutual messed up or my sister did because we never heard about it). She said when covid happened her marriage became hell for her, that it had uncovered a side of her ex she never knew. He became abusive, had disdain for their son, revealed he used to record every single conversation of theirs, had convinced her she was crazy and a bad wife and mother. That she stuck with him because of the kids until she had enough, that a very good neighbor of theirs whom she had become friends with gave her a lot of support and even helped line her up with a job. During all this she even blamed our parents for her sticking with the marriage for so long and for not reaching out. I told her they had literally pleaded with her not to do this, I was there, I was 18 not 8. She said they told her she was dead to them if she ran off with him and so she blamed them for her not being able to leave him. I told her that was insane logic and she just didnt want to talk about them and asked me not to tell them about her. I said yeah her relationship with them is her own.

I also asked her who had given her my address, she begged me not to ask her that, that they hadnt given it easily she'd had to swear secrecy, and cry and convince them that I'd want to see my older sister, so I dropped it.

We had tea and snacks after that she asked me again if I wanted to do anything this weekend since she has the kids or we could do somethimg the weekend after just the two of us, I said I don't know. She was ok with that answer. She was tearful again when I was leaving, we hugged and I hugged the kids goodbye too.

My mind has been a mess since then. I lashed out and everything, but also regret what I said, but then I also try to remember how I had felt back then and then get angry again. It feels so weird knowing that shes now 20 minutes away from me and we can visit whenever. I told my girlfriend about all this, she said she supports me no matter what but in her opinion to consider the weekend plan with a cool mind.

This got long, I apologize but Ive been trying to collect my own thoughts on this and writing this just seemed to help. Thanks for the help.

**Comment 1:**

Don't let her push you into immediately pretending everything is fine and going back to how things were.

She still isn't taking responsibility for the harm she did, you didn't mention she ever apologised for ghosting you. She's blaming your parents for her choices. She needs to admit she did this to herself and to you or that hurt and resentment is never going away.

If she won't tell you who gave her your address she has no interest in what you want, only what she wants and she will manipulate you (and them) again and again to get what she wants.

**Comment 2:**

Honestly, why block you at all if she didn’t feel you didn’t do anything wrong?

She doesn’t really seem to recognize the hurt she dealt you, nor is she really willing to acknowledge how much she screwed up and continues to blame your parents for everything. Frankly, it’s immature of her on all fronts.

Also, she keeps pressing you to meet up with her this weekend, which shows she doesn’t respect your need for space or time. She’s just going to keep on boundary stomping into your live with the surface level of apologies and assume it should be all good.

Also introducing the kids right away is a manipulation tactic so you can’t be as honest and frank as you would have been if they weren’t around.

She definitely seems to be me, me, me. I don’t really seem how reconnecting with her now would really benefit your life. She is pretty much a stranger.

**Comment 3:**

It really rubs me the wrong way that the first thing she wants is meeting her kids and pushing for a relationship, which to me seems pretty manipulative tbh. Just baiting you to be in contact.

Also, that wouldn't have happened if she didn't get divorced. She says her leaving had nothing to do with you but blocked you and never bothered again to stay in touch.

I'd be very careful and hit the brakes, she is moving way too fast and shows no accountability. That's not how it works.

**Comment 4:**

NTA - it is understandable that your feeling are somewhat conflicted where your sister is concerned. The pain she put you and your parents through not to mention you needing to clean up after her disappearance is very hard to get past and forgive. What I noted is she was eager for you to need her kids and offered to do something together with the kids. I'd also swear she's looking for a free babysitter. Whatever you decide, move slowly and carefully. She's broken all trust and faith, should you decide to let her into your life go one step and a time and be mindful of ulterior motives. Good luck!

**Comment 5:**

I'm glad you and your sister talked? I'm late to the party, but I was in a similar boat recently.... and my sister is now married to a woman. So, good luck OP!

That's a great moment to... just be atleast hear out one another? on what's happened, one another's view that doesn't mean you're forced to do anything, but atleast you have the ability to decide if this is something you could pursue.

My sister came from a DV relationship, and so did I... the fact that we're both still alive and able to talk about our shitty parents is a huge support beam in my system. She is still recovering, and so am I. But we have one another, and she had her awesome wife!

Just, take some time off the internet and enjoy a day where you relax, go out for a nice coffee and lunch, maybe to the park, all on your own and just think. Allow yourself to cry in your car, talk to yourself, a you day with selfcare, or maybe a day in cuddled up warm pillows, creating/drawing, but I really recommend getting out of the house off the internet. Dopamine media detox for a day basically, and let yourself feel, and think.

**OP:**

Im going to try and clear my mind thanks. I've been thinking this again and again that I should do what makes me happy, and maybe that is being able to reconnect with her and her kids and then I think that's letting her off too easy, I was in pain back then trying to reach out, what about that. Its been emotionally taxing. Your advice about taking some tine off is good.

**Update 2 (added to the same post):**

Hi, I’d been getting a lot of moral support and advice from a lot of people here which I appreciate. A few people had asked how things have gone. So I told my sister I couldn’t sped thanksgiving weekend with her. Partly because maybe I still wasn’t in the right headspace for something like that and also because I had t go to my parents for that weekend, and normally when I go there I usually end up staying over for the entire weekend. She said ok, asked me not to tell them that she was back in my life, i said fine, it wasn’t my place and besides my parents had come to terms with her absence a while back.

It was a bit surreal for sure to be with my parents and have this secret with me. We were spending the weekend like a complete family while my sister was at her apartment and knowing this was weird. When I was back she asked if I wanted to hang out next weekend (the one that just passed), her kids would be with their dad so the two of us could hang out.

I know what a lot of commenters had said. I appreciate all their advice. But I had tried to clear my head and my girlfriend had just told me to do whatever makes me happy. I did think about it, and I honestly decided that hanging out with her on Saturday would make me happier than not doing it. It wasn’t about her, it was for myself, so I went to her apartment on Saturday.

She asked me how our parents were doing I said they were doing well now. Since she was the one who mentioned them I asked her if she wanted to reconnect with them, it might be better for both her and maybe them, but she said no, and just repeated that line about them saying she was dead to them. It was clearly something said in the heat of the moment but I didn’t push her on it again. We just went to the mall, bought some clothes, then had dinner at her place and watched a movie. It was a light hangout in general, the conversation flowed smoothly. It obviously wasn't like it used to be, partly because I still keep thinking about how I felt when she had left us, about how I had to support our parents emotionally in the aftermath and partly because she has changed a bit, shes a lot more anxious and nervous now than I remember her. But in general it was a chill hangout.

I did bring up that I’d like to know who gave her my address that at this point I didn’t regret that they had given it to her but still they shouldn’t do that. She got defensive and begged me not to ask her that, that they hadn’t just given it easily, she’d had to plead and cry and promise that she’d take a rejection if that’s what I did, and that she’d sworn secrecy. So again I dropped it, its whatever I guess. I left and we said we’ll meet up again soon.

I had received a lot of comments saying I was stupid, that I had no self-esteem that I was being used. I just would like you to understand that this isn’t an abstract concept for me like it might be for you. This is my sister. The same sister who i grew up with, who helped me with school projects and helped me out in a ton of ways when I was growing up. And yes the same sister who ghosted us for 9 years. I’m still angry about that, but like I said I’m only doing what I want for myself, not out of some guilt now. And look so far I’m down a subway fare’s worth of dollars to visit her and a few hours at the mall, I’m fine with that loss. If after all this she ups and ghosts me again in the future for whatever reason, I’ve made my peace with that, and may we all get what we deserve in that case. Thank you for all the help.

A few people had asked how things were going. I'd taken a bit of a break because its just complicated and I felt asking others input was hurting more than helping.

My sister and her kids and I had been meeting up whenever we could find time and it was enriching like I liked that we were spending time regardless of a lot of feedback saying I was being had.

I went to my parents for the Christmas and New Year's holidays. During that period there had been a couple of gatherings with the entire family, uncles and aunts and cousins. It was in those gatherings I guess that I contextualized the extent to which my sister's actions had affected our family. All the other families were full, all siblings and kids, some of them with their spouses and young kids of their own. Ours was torn. And the entire extended family would still walk on eggshells sometimes. None of my cousins had had to listen to their mom cry about their estranged sister while in college studying for exams and midterms and what not.

I also realized I had been lying by omission to my parents about something huge, the whereabouts of their daughter whom they still love and worry about. My relationship with them is the one that has sustained and withstood. So a couple of weeks ago, I told my sister as much. That asking me to keep a secret like this wasn't fair. I was kind about it, I didn't lash out, didn't try to make her feel bad about everything we'd been put through. She was the one who got heated, saying our parents had told her she was dead to them, that she was facing hell while they had left her to die, I then brought up that they were the ones who did their best to prevent her from ending up in that situation and she was the one who had left because she thought she knew better, because she cared more about her boyfriend than her entire family whom she cut all contact with. She didn't budge on not talking to our parents, and I too said that we can't be talking then, I'm not risking a staple relationship for one that had proved to be flaky. That may have crossed a line because that led to tears.

We didn't tell my niece and nephew that I won't be seeing them for a while. I don't know what she's going to explain to them. its painful for me too. Since then my sister hasn't said anything on text just sent pictures or videos (like she was already doing) of the kids or what was made for dinner, a few times. I've heart reacted but said nothing either. I do hope we can come to a resolution on her end and the kids get to be close to their uncle and their grandparents.

**Relevant Comments:**

**Comment 1:**

Your sister is selfish and put you in an impossible situation.

She wants a relationship after what she did but it’s still on her terms.

She doesn’t get to dictate anything after what she did to you and your family, now it’s all blown up in her face she’s happy to let you back in her life. Ask her if she was still with her husband would she have even bother trying to connect with you.

I seriously doubt it OP.

**Comment 2:**

Your sister is putting you in the middle. She wanted you to keep it secret from your parents that you and her were in contact, yet she won’t reveal who told her your address. Why is she protecting this other person but doesn’t appreciate the position you’re in, especially if your parents did find out that you had been meeting with her and their grandchildren.

She doesn’t seem to understand the emotional distress she’s putting you under and appeared flippant when you mentioned that she had also blocked you all those years ago. Sounds like a one-sided relationship to me.

There’s still too much unresolved hurt and emotions going on here. Maybe a little break might help you to clear your head a little and help you to decide what part you want to play in this whole mess.

Good luck

**Comment 3:**

I'm glad your sister is safe but it's really not fair for her to put your relationship with your parents in danger. Are you going to tell your parents that you heard from her?

**OP:**

No I won't. I won't take that decision from her. Thats her call. If thats why she didn't contact me once all this time, its unbelievable that she thought I would have.

**Comment 4:**

Your sister just doesn’t want to be held accountable for her poor decisions so she doesn’t want to face your parents.

She’s now trying to use her kids to coerce you into having a relationship with her when you aren’t the one with the problem it’s her. She’s not changed no matter how much she cries she will always choose to blame your parents for her poor choices.

**Comment 5:**

At this point OP, I’d tell your parents she reached out and that you have seen her. If/when they ever find out they will be so so hurt with you that you kept it from them. As you said, you need to prioritize your relationship with your parents. Your sister has misplaced anger and I hope she finds peace someday.

1qqtipg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1qqtipg/how_do_i_know_if_a_girl_likes_me_male/,How Do I Know If A Girl Likes Me (Male)?,"Hi everyone,

I'm 20M, and I have a big crush on an approximately 21/22F. I'm in the second semester of my second year of university, and she's in the second semester of her fourth year of university (she's graduating this June). We're in similar programs (Medical Sciences (Me) versus Biological Sciences (She)), and we share one class: anatomy (we are in the same lecture and lab section)

Why do I have a crush on her, you may ask? My answer is very simple. First, she's very beautiful (freckles, curly, brown hair, and a gleaming smile). And second, her intellectual and emotional intelligence/maturity is beyond imagination. She's also very ambitious, motivated, and disciplined, which I like.

So far, we've seen each other three times in the lab and twice in the lecture. She wasn't there for the first lecture, and we've been sitting in all our lectures because she asked in our second lab, which was before our second lecture, where I sit and if she could sit with me, and I said yes.

Whenever she sees me, she smiles, waves, and comes to me and strikes up a conversation that can hold up. During the conversation, we also look into each other's eyes and smile, but I don't remember laughing \*that\* much. I don't know if she looks into my eyes and laughs out of politeness or genuine attraction (she's more of the shy type). We have similar interests, at least academically, such as our research projects, but I haven't asked her anything about hobbies or, personally, so to speak. When I see her, I compliment her on how smart she is, and I give her encouragement, such as today reminding her that her hard work will pay off tomorrow on her exam. I'm scared of doing anything beyond that because I don't want to be seen as a creep or be misinterpreted.

For example, today she told me she might be late to the lecture and that I should find a seat; she'd find me, but I replied that it's all okay and I'd wait until the last minute for her. I don't know if that was a mistake or how she interpreted it?? We sat in lecture, and all went well, and as we were walking out, she asked me where I was headed, and I said the ninth floor of the library, and she said the same. It's a quiet zone, so we sat beside each other, backs to each other (lol). When we both got hungry, we left together, but we parted ways. We did talk about what we're eating, but she didn't invite me (maybe because I said I have Invisalign and can't eat out, IDK???). Like this is the dilemma, the green flag in my eyes is that she let me know what's up (didn't say ""Hey, X"", just, ""Hey! ..."", but still), that she's cheerful, and can keep the convo going. But my mind is thinking, she hasn't complimented you, and she hasn't engaged in physical attraction (but I don't think it's even appropriate to engage in something physical (holding hands) in a place like a lab or lecture hall).

The issue is that I don't know if SHE likes me?? From this story, does this seem more like a regular friendship or something more (I want to think the latter)? I have a friend (male), and he tells me that if she doesn't give me compliments, then that's a sign that this is just a regular friendship, but another friend (female) says that compliments are not mandatory.

I invited her to study together this weekend for our upcoming anatomy exam (She agreed. Later, through text, she said, ""Yay! I booked Room #"", (close to the one I booked initially). I don't know how to interpret the ""Yay!""). I will say, I am planning to invite her to coffee (I haven't said that yet; I didn't even frame it as a date). I don't know if she's getting cues that I like her, and I don't know if I should ""push on"" or if it's creepy.

TLDR: I have a big crush on a girl, and I am trying to make it obvious I like her, and there are so many signs she likes me, but can also be interpreted as just regular frienship. I'm lost as to which it is.

I'm always very understanding of his excuses despite all the weed etc. he's always able to afford. I usually just add the shortfall to a balance of money he owes me and I've asked him to pay on it when he can. This month tho, he got sick and then I did too despite not having seen him at all (shared bathroom I guess) so I simply just can't afford to cover for him this month as I have the last 7 months. Though he said his paycheck was 204 whereas mine was 160 cuz we were both out sick, but I find myself wondering if he's lying to begin with cuz he worked 25hrs at a much higher payrate than me whereas I only worked 10hrs.

I've also been generous with money in other ways, such as offering to loan him money so he could pay his phone bill (I didn't think it would take him 3 months, but he kept ""thinking"" he already paid me all the money he owed me 🙄). When he first moved in, I gave him the whole month free for helping me throw trash into a rental dumpster. He cleaned my 2 litterboxes when I got really sick and neglected them for 2 weeks (he didn't do that for me or the cats, he did it cuz he had a guest coming over) so I gave him 1 week no rent, that's $140 for cleaning 2 litterboxes!!! The only thing he's bought for the house in 7 months is a 4 pack of toilet paper (mind you this man is home only 5hrs a day and somehow still uses nearly a WHOLE roll). He used my whole 10gal bucket of laundry detergent in 5 months and is now using my dish soap so he doesn't have to buy more detergent. 12pk of tp disappears in under 2 weeks, less if they start disappearing to his room. Depleted my entire coffee bar (coffees, several syrups, oat creamers, snacks) replaced only the coffee, then drank that whole bag too before I got 1 cup. Bought a new set of dishes and all 10 cups got used before I got the chance to reach for 1, they've been sitting dirty in the sink since last year. He will help himself to my food and drinks, often consuming at least half if not all. There's soooo much more and this doesn't even take into consideration how he talks to me and acts toward me on top of all this at home or at work (he's my ""boss"" too btw...)

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1qqtg1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1qqtg1f/how_do_i_know_if_a_girl_like_me_male/,How Do I Know If A Girl Like Me (Male)?,"Hi everyone,

I'm 20M, and I have a big crush on an approximately 21/22F. I'm in the second semester of my second year of university, and she's in the second semester of her fourth year of university (she's graduating this June). We're in similar programs (Medical Sciences (Me) versus Biological Sciences (She)), and we share one class: anatomy (we are in the same lecture and lab section)

Why do I have a crush on her, you may ask? My answer is very simple. First, she's very beautiful (freckles, curly, brown hair, and a gleaming smile). And second, her intellectual and emotional intelligence/maturity is beyond imagination. She's also very ambitious, motivated, and disciplined, which I like. 

So far, we've seen each other three times in the lab and twice in the lecture. She wasn't there for the first lecture, and we've been sitting in all our lectures because she asked in our second lab, which was before our second lecture, where I sit and if she could sit with me, and I said yes.

Whenever she sees me, she smiles, waves, and comes to me and strikes up a conversation that can hold up. During the conversation, we also look into each other's eyes and smile, but I don't remember laughing \*that\* much. I don't know if she looks into my eyes and laughs out of politeness or genuine attraction (she's more of the shy type). We have similar interests, at least academically, such as our research projects, but I haven't asked her anything about hobbies or, personally, so to speak. When I see her, I compliment her on how smart she is, and I give her encouragement, such as today reminding her that her hard work will pay off tomorrow on her exam. I'm scared of doing anything beyond that because I don't want to be seen as a creep or be misinterpreted.

For example, today she told me she might be late to the lecture and that I should find a seat; she'd find me, but I replied that it's all okay and I'd wait until the last minute for her. I don't know if that was a mistake or how she interpreted it?? We sat in lecture, and all went well, and as we were walking out, she asked me where I was headed, and I said the ninth floor of the library, and she said the same. It's a quiet zone, so we sat beside each other, backs to each other (lol). When we both got hungry, we left together, but we parted ways. We did talk about what we're eating, but she didn't invite me (maybe because I said I have Invisalign and can't eat out, IDK???). Like this is the dilemma, the green flag in my eyes is that she let me know what's up (didn't say ""Hey, X"", just, ""Hey! ..."", but still), that she's cheerful, and can keep the convo going. But my mind is thinking, she hasn't complimented you, and she hasn't engaged in physical attraction (but I don't think it's even appropriate to engage in something physical (holding hands) in a place like a lab or lecture hall). 

The issue is that I don't know if SHE likes me?? From this story, does this seem more like a regular friendship or something more (I want to think the latter)? I have a friend (male), and he tells me that if she doesn't give me compliments, then that's a sign that this is just a regular friendship, but another friend (female) says that compliments are not mandatory.

I invited her to study together this weekend for our upcoming anatomy exam (She agreed. Later, through text, she said, ""Yay! I booked Room #"", (close to the one I booked initially). I don't know how to interpret the ""Yay!""). I will say, I am planning to invite her to coffee (I haven't said that yet; I didn't even frame it as a date). I don't know if she's getting cues that I like her, and I don't know if I should ""push on"" or if it's creepy. 

TLDR: I have a big crush on a girl, and I am trying to make it obvious I like her, and there are so many signs she likes me, but can also be interpreted as just regular frienship. I'm lost as to which it is. 

If you read this, thank you!! I really appreciate it, and I'm open to all feedback. ",1,1769741451.0,Crushes,4,1.0,False
1qqtfu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qqtfu3/pietro_is_so_good/,Pietro is so good,"So I decided to take a week off from my Pietro and just use my ZP6, Comadante and my Philos with SSP MP burrs 

The Pietro has been my daily pour over grinder for about 9 months now and i use the others sparingly or when I want to focus on a different dimension of a cup.

So the past week or so I just decided I wanted to change things up and not use the Pietro just to see how I was liking the brews from the other grinders. 

Kinda what I found was I liked one dimension of each grinder. 

ZP6 with its clarity

SSP MP’s with its acidity

Comadante with its roundness 

Coming back to the Pietro the last couple days made me realize (my perception anyways) is that it really blends all of those elements harmoniously in the best way. 

Sure this grinder feels like the cheese grater they use at Olive Garden but the coffee it helps produce is second to none. This is also coming from someone who is out of the honey moon phase and went without the stand for 4 months because it was sold out! The coffee is worth the pain!

1qqtf9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1qqtf9v/mass_review_a_little_bit_of_this_a_little_bit_of/,"Mass Review: A little bit of this, a little bit of that","I used to post reviews regularly but got out of the habit, so it is what it is. 

  
Note: All of these (except for one) are currently available. I didn't figure they would do all that much good otherwise. The notes are copied directly from the sites. 

Arcana

1. **Snowed In** EDP: Reddish brown in the bottle. Chocolate peppermint, but no toothpaste here This is dark chocolate ganache, rich and decadent, sprinkled with candy cane flakes on top. The coconut balances the peppermint. This is snuggling into a cashmere blanket while drinking a cup of expensive peppermint hot chocolate. I haven't seen too many people review it, but I think that if you're looking for a winter chocolate scent, you can't go wrong with this one. 

Notes: Opens with dark chocolate brownies studded with red and white peppermint sticks. The drydown reveals Tahitian vanilla oleoresin, whipped coconut cream, body-warmed silk, and a hint of cashmere

  
2. **Poudre Douce EDP:** Spicy powder. You're baking something and you have the flour and the sugar ready and you just dumped in a bunch of spices. This is not going to be a universally loved fragrance, but it is super unique and well-crafted. The cardamom is at the front, the cinnamon in the middle, and the caramel hangs back, but they are all there. 

Notes: Translating to sweet powder, poudre douce is a delicious spice mix dating back to the Middle Ages. Ribbons of warm, melted caramel are spiced with golden cardamom, Ceylon cinnamon, and toasty nutmeg

3. **Krampus EDP**: a coniferous blend of Poudre Douce and Snowed in. Take Snowed In's candy canes and Poudre Douce's cinnamon, mix it into an ambered frankincense, and you have Krampus. When I first got this, Krampus and Snowed In were more similar to one another. Now that they are aged, the frankincense has really stepped forward. I honestly love this and how unisex it is, but I can't imagine it would be for everyone. I think that Arcana does frankincense better than just about any other house though. 

Notes: Opening with the olfactory place where Noble fir boughs, bakery cinnamon, and cold, minty candy canes blend together into one sweet high note. The drydown reveals dark amber, rich vanilla, and dry woods hewn with infernal frankincense resin

4. **Queen Mab EDP**: This is not quite what I thought it would be. I kind of thought it would be a less smoky, more floral creamsicle than Bifrost. I think I like Bifrost better, to be honest. In this, the bitter orange and the petitgrain team up to create a very dry, powdery orange. The marshmallow stays close to the back. You can pick it up but it's not the main note. No, the main note in this is the orange blossom. It might be that it's just not working well in the cold, and that it will shine in the humidity of summer, but this is not dazzling me as much as I hoped it would. I originally ordered Reunited with the Pack but traded it out for Queen Mab when someone said RwtP had a cannabis note. I will note that the website doesn't say that it has a cannabis note, and that the listed notes are ""pineapple, spruce, strawberry, cotton candy, and pine cones"" but they also didn't refute the cannabis note when I asked about it. 

  
Notes: Intoxicating orange blossoms with marshmallow pillows, narcotic petitgrain, creamy coconut milk, wild harvested bitter orange, Tahitian vanilla, and feathery ylang ylang petals

5. **On the Wing** oil: I'll admit, I am not the target audience for this. I am not a skin scent person. I'm not a subtle person in general. So this was kind of a nothing-burger for me. It smells like nice air?  A bit of an airy, slightly oceanic amber? I'd enjoy it if my laundry smelled like this, but I don't personally want to wear something this light. 

Notes: Creamy white amber, velvety cashmere, shimmering silk voile, salty Orcanox, and diaphanous musk.

  
Sugar Spider

**Drizz:** Arcana decided to remove the Sugar Spider scents from Arcana's website, which, personally, I think is the wrong move. I only hear people talk about SS because they ordered at the same time as Arcana, so I think they're losing audience. But whatever, right? 

I ordered Drizz because I love eggnog and I love boozy scents. Just because I don't really drink doesn't mean I can't love the way they smell, right? Anyway, this is a great eggnog scent, like Southern Comfort eggnog straight out of the carton. This is only available for a couple more days (it comes down Feb 1st). 

  
Notes: A rich blend of eggnog, rompope, and crema de vie is spiked with Havana rum and plenty of grated nutmeg



Osmofolia

**Venus Retrograde**: I keep thinking I'll grow to like this one more than I do. What I realized is that I like frankincense a lot, but not so much love for myrrh. Dehydrated strawberries blended in with myrrh. Eventually, the jasmine joins in, but it's more of a floral incense (light on the smoke) than a real jasmine. This smells like a Scratch and Sniff sticker or a scented pencil eraser to me. 

Notes: Jasmine, Strawberry, Incense, Myrrh, Elemi, and Skin Musk 



Poesie: 

**Madar:**  I do like that you can pick out each of the scents, and yet it's a cohesive scent story. I pick out the roses, pistachios, and rice pudding first. The orange flower, cinnamon, and cardamom are more like supporting players. If you want to smell comforting without it being a strongly gourmand scent, this is a good one. It lasts quite a while longer than most of my other Poesies if I put it on my clothes, but it lasts about three or so hours on my skin. It doesn't project a whole lot, but it does ok. I full-sized after sampling because I was sad I was running low, which is a good indicator to me that it's full-size worthy. 

Notes: comforting, creamy basmati rice pudding flavored with orange flower water, saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, dried rose petals, and sugared pistachios

  
**Aphrodite's Breakfast**: This, to me, is probably the safest candidate for a Cardamonth blind buy. I'm lucky, because that's what I did, but I honestly would advise against doing the same. I thought I would like Comfort way more and found it entirely too dry, so don't gamble, sample. 

The first sniffs are of the Pandan leaf and jasmine green tea. I'd say the jasmine green tea is at the front, then the thick green custard. The ""buttery edges"" and, honestly, the cardamom, aren't super forward. They're there, just behind the tea. The tea is balanced by the milkiness of the bread and custard, but it's the star of the show to my nose. 

Notes: sweet milk bread soaked in cardamom and pandan- leaf infused custard, caramelized buttery edges, a dainty cup of jasmine green tea  


**Dolce Far Niente**: this was me trying to expand my horizons. And I honestly do like it more than I thought I would. I thought this would be too sweet of a gourmand, but it's actually barely sweet at all. This is a black cup of coffee and a dark chocolate version of those viral Dubai bars that cost like $20 for a single bar of chocolate. It doesn't last all that long, but I would consider up sizing and just putting it on clothes to try and extend the longevity. 

Notes: cardamom, caramelized pastry, pistachio paste, creamy vanilla-infused mascarpone layered with coffee-soaked cookies, soft milk chocolate

**Kindness and Mischief**: this was a free sample. I wouldn't have ordered this to try for myself, but it's fun, so I can see how people would love it. It's mostly a lemon marshmallow to my nose. The cardamom adds a little dry spice, but it's a relatively linear lemon marshmallow to my nose. I only included a review here because I haven't seen too many reviews of this lately. 

  
Pineward

  
**Gingerbread**: Less sugary gingerbread, more like ginger snap cookies to me. This is basically pure molasses and gingersnaps to me, the cinnnamon, cloves, and nutmeg indistinguishable because they are mixed into the gingerbread mix. I'm not super convinced I received the 2025 version, which is supposed to be sweeter than the previous version, because this is not sweet at all. 

Notes: ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, wheat absolute, molasses distillate, brown sugar, black walnut, milk accord, butter, vanilla, icing

**Gluhwein**: cranberry wine, dark chocolate, some fir. This is like viscous, dark wine with dried fruits floating within it. It's dark, boozy, and expensive. You eat chocolate while you wait for it to boil. 

Notes: cranberry, champaca, cherry compote, raspberry, fir balsam, chocolate, davana attar, oakmoss, tolu balsam, rose, sandalwood, frankincense



Solstice Scents

**Violet Mallow**: I don't even like 99% of violet notes, so I have no idea why I took a chance on this one. I'm glad I did. Apparently, I don't like violet unless it's SS! This is a feminine, flowery, pillowy musky violet. The vanilla bean is rich, the white musk is floaty, the marshmallow cream is sweet without being overly so. It's not an every day scent for me, but it's sure a keeper! I think this might only be available as an EDP now. 

Notes: Marshmallow Cream, Violet Flowers, Vanilla Bean, White Musk

**Violet Truffle**: Again, no idea why I ordered this (at the same time as Violet Mallow) since I'd had such bad luck with violet previously (it smelled like Froot Loops to me). This isn't Froot Loops though, because it's too busy being a Bad Bitch. Yeah, I said it. If you normally hate florals, check this one out. It's mostly dark chocolate, but a sexy, soft kind, not bitter, just super rich, floating amongst a gentle violet note. I just realized this one isn't currently available, so I apologize for not catching that until now. 

Notes: Dark Chocolate, Violet, Violet Leaf & Vanilla

1qqtes4,https://i.redd.it/krrl8n0ohegg1.jpeg,I have developed a free to use Fire Alarm Panel Simulator,"**Link: https://jamiew1010.github.io/firealarmsim/**

I've been working hard on a little side project and wanted to share it with folks who are a bit geeky with fire alarms, deal with fire alarm systems, training, or just want to mess around with panel logic.

If you find it fun and useful please share with as many people as you can, a growth in support would mean working on a lot more features.

It took a ton of work to get the behaviors accurate (latching, fault persistence, power priority, etc.), so any feedback is super welcome – bugs, suggestions, or ""this behaves wrong compared to real panels X/Y/Z"" – drop a comment!

Optional support: Keeping the site free/hosting/updates going relies on coffee money 😄 If you'd like to chip in toward future features and server costs, you can donate here (totally voluntary!):

Donate here: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted\_button\_id=5DFJFUKA3KJM6

What it does / Core features:

\- Realistic zone status (1–10 zones): Normal, Fault, Fire (flashing when active), Panel Off.

\- Full panel indicators: System Normal, Mains Power OK/Low/Off, Battery OK/Low/Off (with proper fault behaviors – power faults don't clear on reset!).

\- Buttons: Acknowledge, Silence, Reset, Test – but they're locked until you ""insert the key"" (click the key area) for that authentic feel.

\- Instructor Control Centre (the fun part!):

\- Trigger fires from MCPs (A–D) or Detectors (A–B) per zone – fires latch until devices cleared + panel reset.

\- Toggle exit doors open/closed (Zones 1–4) → triggers system fault & yellow zone unless fire overrides.

\- Apply zone faults or full panel fault.

\- Switch power states (mains/battery combos) to simulate real failures.

\- Sounders: Different profiles, adjustable volume, fault beep timing, preview sounds, global mute. (Browser needs a click first for audio to play – standard web thing.)

\- Live event log with timestamps (e.g., ""\[06:24:12\] Fire in Zone 3 – MCP A activated"").

\- Clean, responsive design – works great on desktop.

Mobile tip: It's best in landscape mode on phones/tablets (portrait works but buttons get tight). No app install needed – just open the link.

Updates, improvements and bug fixes are coming!

This started as a way to help visualize and practice panel responses without hardware. The base version has most core simulation logic down, but I'm actively working on updates like:

\- Light/dark mode

\- More authentic fire alarm sound samples (instead of generated tones)

\- Customizable zone/detector counts

\- Panel color themes (silver, red, etc.)

So yeah if you enjoy this please donate, and reply with any bugs you find. Things you like, dislike, and updates you would love to see",1,1769741357.0,firealarmenthusiasts,0,1.0,False

I've been at my job for 5 years, and am known for being VERY good at my job. I get a ton of recognition and praise from customers, but never from my manager. This is no surprise, as I've never gotten along with my manager. We have butted heads in the past. Even though I'm a good employee, I don't take shit and kind of am known for standing up for myself, apparently to my detriment. Manager has a queen bee clique, and I'm not part of it. Manager has hung out with my colleagues outside of work. We all got together once, and manager barely spoke to me. I guess you could say we're like oil and water. I've really tried, though. I consistently give my manager positive feedback, mostly because I want to have a better relationship with them. I have tried to get along. It's difficult, though, when your manager acts like someone pissed in their coffee when they talk to you every single day. I mean, I know my manager doesn't like me. It's fine, my work is good.
The problem is, I butted heads with a coworker who is in the manager's clique. Now, I did overreact with this person in my frustration, and I own that. I apologized to this person, at least. I haven't been in a good place mentally and the work dynamic is starting to get to me. A plum project I was working on has been halted and basically forgotten about. I was really into that project, too.
The issue is, now it seems that EVERYONE in my team knows what happened with the coworker. I can only assume my manager told the clique, and it spread in our team. My only work friend is now avoiding me. I feel like I've been kicked in the stomach. 
It sucks that I'm persona non grata now. I want to leave, but if I do, that means I probably won't get a good reference. If I stay, I know things won't get better. Advice?

1qqtc12,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1qqtc12/unseen_exposure/,Unseen Exposure,"Max Burns is an amateur photographer. Though his profession is not photography, he does take photos as a hobby. On one of his days off, he received a call to take some photos of an abandoned house.

The person who requested this of him was a friend named Violet Moss.

She is a realtor who flips houses and resells them to make a profit. Max agreed and went to the address Violet had given him. Upon arrival, the house came into view. He had never seen something so unique.

It was a cliff-anchored house; this type of home is only seen sometimes due to the frequent landslides in the area. Pulling into a makeshift parking space, he parked his car, grabbed his gear, and walked up to the door.

A note was left on the door telling Max where the key was. At the bottom of the note, Violet apologized for not being there since she had to draw up the final paperwork. Retrieving the key from under a flower pot, he went inside.

Shutting the door behind him, he flipped the light switch for the lights that slowly blinked to life. Setting up his gear, he began to go through each room, taking photos. It was relatively empty and seemed odd to Max since Violet always decorated, especially if she would make a sale.

With the bottom floor done, he headed upstairs, cutting the lights on.

Stepping into the doorway of one of the bedrooms, he snapped a photo, and his camera began beeping at him. Confused, he looked at the screen flashing with the low battery symbol.

He sighed, took out another battery pack, and replaced it. The camera was fully charged, so why did it suddenly become drained? Shaking his head, Max continued finishing up the upstairs, then made his way back down.

Walking to the kitchen counter, he opened his laptop and inserted the memory card from his camera to review and edit the photos he had taken. Looking through the images, he came across the one he had taken of the first upstairs bedroom.

Inside the room, there was a figure. Static and grey, the person was about average height and thin, with their head hanging down. There was no way this was a ghost. Max didn't believe in the supernatural and blamed the camera for malfunctioning due to the drained battery. So he would retake the photo.

Max sent Violet an email with the photos he approved, and she quickly replied, asking him if he was still inside the house. He replied, telling her he was still inside the house finishing up. Violet, in a panic, told him to get out of there.

A creak from the stairs made him turn as he took out his phone and snapped a picture with its camera. Max cursed, forgetting his flash was on, and tried to take another when footsteps thumped across the floor towards him.

He dropped his phone and backed away from the island counter. What had made its way down to him? Max's phone began to ring, startling him. From where he stood, he could see Violet trying to call him.

Max cursed under his breath. ""Okay, Max, don't be such a baby. Ghosts are not real. Just grab your phone and answer it."" he said aloud to himself, taking a deep breath before grabbing his phone and quickly answering it.

""V-violet""

""Maxie, is everything okay? I'm on my way to your location. I need you to grab your stuff and go wait in your car."" she tells him, trying not to express the rising panic in her voice.

""Is something wrong with the house?"" Max asked, looking around and listening to his surroundings as he packed his stuff.

""Just trust me and get out."" She ended the call, and Max did as he was told. He put his bag over his shoulder, and his cell phone was the last thing he reached for. The lights in the room flickered before going out, ultimately leaving him in nothing but the darkness of the kitchen.

When Max let out an exhale of air, he could see his breath, making him visibly shiver. Keeping his eyes on the middle of the room, he walked backward, reaching his hand behind him to open the door. Once the door was open, he stepped out, almost tripping in the process, and shut the door.

Moving quickly, he went to his car, opened the door, and sat inside.

Max tossed his bag into the passenger seat and took out his phone to look at his photo of the stairs. What he looked at differed from the one he had taken from the bedroom. There was a man with no head, and his body was covered with something black. It dripped onto the floor, and the ax he carried was covered in dried blood.

Looking up from his phone, Max heard the house's front door open. He watched as it stayed open for a while until it slammed shut. Could the ghost not leave the house? If that was the case, Max was grateful. Violet parked next to him.

They sat in her car and talked briefly about what had just happened, and Max showed her the photos. ""This is just crazy,"" Violet paused and looked at Max. I'm so sorry this happened to you. I knew strange things were happening, but you got them on camera.""

""Didn't anyone else try taking photos or recordings??"" he questioned.

Violet shook her head. ""No, my crew was scared, so I looked into its history. Once I found out what happened, I looked for a buyer immediately. The person that I found deals with this sort of thing.""

Is there a person who deals with those things in there? Did Violet find an exorcist or a medium? Hopefully, that person is both.

""What exactly did you find out about this place?"" Max asked, putting his phone and laptop away. Violet gripped the steering wheel, looking over at him with a frown.

""That man in the photo killed his family in that house. His wife had been cheating on him, and he found out."" she began to explain.

Violet slowly took her hands off the wheel and placed them in her lap.

""He then hung himself above the stairs. When a family friend found them, he'd been hanging there so long that his head detached. His wife was practically decapitated upstairs. Thankfully, they didn't have children."" she added.

Max shuddered, thankful he had taken the pictures and got out of there when he did. He'd hate to think about what would have happened if he had stayed inside a little longer.

""You don't have any more houses like this, do you?"" Max asked nervously.

Violet shook her head. ""No, but if I do, I'll warn you first.""

""I'd appreciate that."" he sighs, leaning his head back against the seat and closing his eyes. This was enough excitement for one day. Hopefully, the person who bought this house knows what they're doing.

A week later, Violet contacted him.

""Hey Violet, did the new owners have any luck?"" Max asked as he headed inside from his regular nine-to-five job for the day.

""Yes, but I have another favor to ask,"" she replied, hearing two other people in the background.

""Oh...uh, sure. What do you need exactly?"" Max nervously swallowed, tossing his keys onto the dish on his coffee table.

""How do you feel about doing Spirit Photography?""

""As a profession?""

""The owner says they would pay you a lot.""

Max pondered this for a moment. If it paid enough, he could quit his office job, especially if this person bought homes like this often.

""Max Burns?"" a deep, gruff voice said on the phone now, making him sit upright. ""My name is Andy Graves, and I need your assistance with my business ventures. You'll be paid for your time and will constantly be on the move. Are you okay with these terms?""

Surprised, he visibly nodded, even if Andy couldn't see him. ""Yes.""

""Good. See you at the airport a few days from now. Monday six in the morning, don't be late."" Andy ended the call, and Max sat on his couch in shock. 'It this is a full-time profession now,' he thought.

Monday came sooner than expected, and he was rushing out the door. He looked at his apartment from over his shoulder before shutting the door one last time. He had already said his goodbyes to Violet the day before, so there would be no tears. When he arrived at the airport, he didn't know what to expect when looking for Andy Graves, but for some reason, he knew it was him when they met.

""Andy Graves?""

""You must be Max Burns.""

""It will be a pleasure working with you, Spirit Photographer.""

Max nodded, feeling a shiver go down his spine as they shook hands.

The alarm went off at 6:30, the same thin electronic chime every weekday for the last three years. He silenced it without opening his eyes and lay still for a moment, listening to the building settle around him. The sharp metallic bangs of the heating, the hiss of an old radiator, and the low hum of electricity in the walls.
This morning felt ordinary.
He swung his feet onto the floor, padded into the kitchen, and poured himself a glass of water from the tap. It tasted faintly metallic, it always did. He gargled and swallowed. The grounds were measured by habit rather than thought and the machine gurgled as it warmed. He made toast, burned one side slightly, then decided to use cream cheese instead of butter. While he ate, he checked his phone. No messages. The time blinked back at him, indifferent.
He brushed his teeth, watched his reflection foam and rinse and reassemble itself into something passable. A man in his early thirties, hair already beginning to thin at the temples, eyes still tired even after sleep. Same as always. Nothing unusual.
He grabbed his jacket, keys, and bag, stepped out into the hallway, and locked the door behind him. The carpet outside his apartment still bore the same dark stain near the wall. Coffee, maybe. Or something worse. He never asked.
At the end of the hall, the elevator doors were closed. A piece of paper had been taped to them, curling inward at the corners.
OUT OF ORDER
Sorry for the inconvenience.
He stared at it for a moment, already adding up how late he could be without it becoming a problem. The building was only five stories. Going down was easier than going up. He turned toward the stairwell.
The door was heavy, painted a dull institutional beige. He pushed it open and stepped inside. The smell was familiar. Concrete, dust, and something faintly chemical. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead.
His footsteps echoed softly in a steady rhythm. One flight, then another. He counted while trying to figure out what song was stuck in his head, already rehearsing the excuse he’d give if anyone noticed the time. At the landing where the ground floor should have been, he reached for the door and pushed it open with the side of his body.
Another stairwell waited on the other side.
He stopped, half inside the doorway, and frowned. For a moment, his mind refused to process what he was seeing. The same gray walls. The same metal railing. The same fluorescent light, humming at the same pitch.
He laughed once, under his breath.
“I miscounted,” he said, to no one.
He stepped through and continued downward.
The next flight felt longer, though he couldn’t have said why. His footfalls sounded slightly flatter now, less sharp, as if the acoustics had shifted by degrees too small to measure. He reached the next landing and opened the door.
More stairs.
His hand lingered on the push bar. He checked the number stenciled on the wall beside the door.
3.
That wasn’t right.
That, that couldn’t be right.
He had started on five. He was so sure of it.
Unease flickered. He smothered it. Older buildings did strange things. Maybe there was a split level. Maybe he had crossed into another section without realizing it.
He glanced at his phone. The screen lit up, bright and reassuring. No signal bars. The time still moved forward.
“Damnit,” he muttered. “I don’t have time for this.”
He went on.
By the fourth door, the unease had settled lower, heavier. Each landing looked exactly like the last, but not in the way identical floors usually did. There was no sense of repetition, no feeling of copying. It felt instead as though he were moving through a single, extended space. One long stair interrupted only by doors that did nothing.
He stopped walking.
The silence pressed in immediately. The hum of the lights seemed louder now, filling the air. His breathing sounded wrong. Too fast, then too slow, as if it no longer matched his steps.
Somewhere below, a sound echoed. Too soft to be a footstep. Too irregular to be the building settling.
It did not repeat.
He turned around and went back up.
He took the steps two at a time, heart hammering hard enough that it blurred his vision.
“No. No. No.”
The numbers on the wall climbed correctly now. 4, then 5, and relief arrived too quickly, like missing a step and finding ground anyway. He reached the door at the top, pulled it open, and spilled back into the hallway.
The carpet.
The stain.
His apartment door, exactly where it should be.
He leaned against the wall and laughed again, louder this time. A short, startled bark of sound. His hands trembled. He clenched them into fists and forced his breathing to slow.
“Just stairs,” he said. “Just a building being weird.”
He unlocked his door and stepped inside.
The apartment greeted him without comment. The end of his coffee still sat on the counter, a thin skin forming on its surface. The clock on the microwave ticked forward. Nothing had shifted. Nothing had waited.
He set his bag down and sank onto the couch, rubbing his face with both hands. As his pulse settled, he took out his phone and opened the calendar app. Meetings. Deadlines. Things that assumed a version of him would be somewhere else in the next hour. He closed it and opened his email, thumb hovering over the keyboard.
Out sick today, he typed. Can’t make it down. Will follow up tomorrow.
He sent it before he could think better of it.
The decision brought a surprising wave of relief. He leaned back and let his head rest against the cushion. The fear receded, leaving behind a dull pressure, like a bruise he’d only notice later.
After a moment, he stood and walked back to the doorway.
The hallway lay empty. The elevator doors were still closed, the sign still taped in place. The stairwell door was shut.
He watched it without knowing why.
Seconds passed. Then a minute. The building felt unnaturally quiet now, as if the usual distant sounds had been absorbed by the walls.
The stairwell door moved.
It did not jerk or slam. It did not creak. It eased open, slow and controlled, as though pushed by a careful hand. The motion was almost gentle.
It stopped halfway.
Light spilled into the hallway, the same fluorescent glow as before. He could see the first step clearly, its edge worn smooth by years of use.
He did not move.
The door waited.

I create this coin any Input would be awesome 
Meet $IOU, the meme coin that didn’t promise you anything—and somehow still owes you money.
$IOU was born out of the most universal human experience on the internet: being told “bro next week” and knowing deep down that next week is a lie. This isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a mirror held up to modern life, group chats, unpaid favors, borrowed chargers, and that $20 you definitely never got back.
The mascot says it all. A crumpled, coffee-stained receipt wearing sunglasses, trying to look cool while clearly stressed. A big red PAID stamp crossed out. Handwritten excuses scribbled all over it. A single tear rolling down its face. In its hand? A phone that says “Seen 2 days ago.” If you’ve ever lent money, time, energy, or trust—this image hits way too close to home.
$IOU doesn’t pretend to have revolutionary tech, a groundbreaking roadmap, or a whitepaper full of buzzwords. That’s the joke. It represents the currency of empty promises and social debt. The stuff that never gets settled, but everyone somehow accepts as normal. In a space full of “trust me” launches, $IOU leans into the honesty: this is a coin backed entirely by vibes, regret, and unpaid balances.
Why does it work? Because it’s self-aware. If it pumps, it’s hilarious. If it dumps, it’s on brand. Either way, it’s funny—and that’s the point. People don’t just buy $IOU hoping to get rich; they buy it because it feels real in a way most meme coins don’t. It’s instantly understandable. You don’t need lore, charts, or explanations. One look and you already get the joke.
$IOU thrives in replies, screenshots, and comment sections. It’s the perfect response coin. Someone says “devs disappeared”? $IOU. Someone asks “wen utility”? $IOU. Someone gets rugged? Congratulations—you just paid off your IOU. The meme writes itself, and that’s where the real value is.
At its core, $IOU is comedy, shared trauma, and internet culture wrapped into one dumb little token. It doesn’t promise to change the world. It just promises to make you laugh while reminding you of every promise that was never kept.
So if you’re tired of fake hype, tired of pretending every coin is “the future,” and want something that embraces the absurdity of it all—welcome to $IOU.

Found he was lactose intolerant. He has been a real struggle for 16 months. Now 2nd baby is here, he is jealous and struggling with both parents home. 

I work 2nd shift and 2 jobs. So I wake up to him napping, then come home to him sleeping. I work 6 days a week and spend my whole Sunday sleeping and trying to help my wife get caught up with chores.

Im currently sitting at my 2nd job, drank coffee and prework out to help with motivation but I cant seem to get up. Its a cash job so im paid for my work, not how long im here. 

My regular job failed to pay my paternity leave and I have bills due. Im out $3300/month just in bills and only make $4500/month at my regular job so quitting my 2nd job isn't an option. Im the shop lead with no immediate supervisor so I have a lot of stress from that.

Im losing my mind and I feel like I have nobody to talk to. Talking to my family or wife seems to only stress them out. I don't drink or do drugs. I have no real outlet other than to suck it up. Im renting a house, my gas bill was over $620 due to poor equipment and my landlord isnt fixing it. Im struggling hard and id rather turn you awesome dad's than put this stress on my family

1qqsz7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qqsz7h/kathy/,Kathy?,"Like any other morning, I awoke to the bossa nova melody of my iPhone alarm tone at 6:45 a.m. I had always set it 30 minutes before my wife’s would go off so I had time for a quick shave and a shower. She would take over the bathroom at 7:15 a.m. and would be pissed if I messed with her morning schedule.

This morning, I rolled out of bed to notice she had already gotten up. Hmm, a little weird. I grabbed my house coat and strolled down the hall, expecting to see the bathroom door closed with her occupying it. Except, it wasn’t. I did, however, hear movement from down in the kitchen, so the mystery was solved.

I finished up my shower routine, dried off, and went back into the bedroom to get dressed for work. Normally, I’d wear a collared shirt and tie to the office, but the weather was cold and miserable, so I think a sweater would be fine with my navy dress pants.

I was pulling on socks when I heard what sounded like laughing from downstairs in the kitchen. It wouldn’t be unusual for my wife, Kathy, to be sitting at the kitchen table scrolling through Facebook memes and sipping her morning coffee, so hearing a laugh wasn’t really unusual. Except this laugh was a bit off. It sounded like her voice, but the cadence was different.

When you live with someone for over 20 years, their cries, shrieks, giggles, moans, and laughs are all very recognizable. This sounded like Kathy trying to imitate someone else’s laugh. Again, weird, but I shrugged it off, put on my watch and wedding band, and headed down the hall towards the stairs and the kitchen. I hated wearing rings, so I had a habit of removing them when I got home from work, or wherever else I’d gone, and then putting them back on again in the morning.

My wife wasn’t in the kitchen as I had expected, but I was more focused on grabbing a mug and filling it with the first of what would likely be a five-coffee day. Last night I had gone out with a few friends to watch the Bills game at Shoeless Joe’s, and it ended up being a later night than any of us had planned, considering we all had to work the next morning. I had crept into the dark bedroom at a little after 1 a.m. and, to my knowledge, successfully gotten under the covers without waking up Kathy. At least that was my assumption since I didn’t feel any movement on her side of the bed. She would normally head up to bed around 10:30 p.m. so I had imagined she was far away in dreamland at that point.

I was sipping my coffee at the kitchen table and scrolling through my work calendar when I could sense that unmistakable feeling of eyes on me. I looked back over my shoulder to see Kathy standing in the kitchen doorway staring at me. Her eyebrows were raised high, and her head was kind of tilted back in an uncomfortable position. A long frown pulling down her mouth in a way that made her face look almost unrecognizable.

Before I could react, my phone in my hand started ringing and scared the crap out of me. It was Marshall at work, and if he was calling, it probably wasn’t good. As suspected, shit was hitting the fan. I had to haul ass across town and into the office as quickly as traffic would allow. I chugged my coffee and looked back at the doorway towards Kathy, but she had already gone back upstairs to finish getting ready for work.

I grabbed my coat, yelled my goodbyes, and darted out to the car. No time to let it warm up, so the drive across town was a chilly one.

The first half of my day was consumed with angry phone calls from clients and team meetings. It wasn’t until around 11 a.m. that I was able to take a breath and head to the coffee station to take a quick 5. As I waited for the Keurig to do its thing, I looked down at my phone and noticed a missed call from Kathy.

I remembered how strange she had looked earlier that morning standing in the doorway, just staring at me with that glum expression stretched on her mouth. The odd way her head was cocked back and her eyebrows raised as if to be questioning something horrible I had done to her. I shuddered but then noticed she had left me a voicemail.

Was I frightened by her? This made no sense. We had spent the better part of our lives together. We didn’t keep secrets and we both knew all of each other’s habits. Even the annoying or gross ones. Soulmates, best friends, bla bla bla, you name it, we were that. But her face this morning was the mask of a stranger. Subtly that is, just like the laugh I heard from the bedroom. It was her but different.

My friend Artie had once taken a photo of me standing by the Las Vegas sign and used an AI app called Grok to make me appear to be doing a popular dance from the 90’s called The Running Man. It looked like me but wasn’t me. Something in the way I moved and smiled was creepy and wrong. I remembered laughing that day when he showed me but deep down inside I hated it. This is the best way I can describe how Kathy made me feel this morning.

I held my phone up to my ear to listen to the message she had left. I strained to hear what sounded mostly like the drone of a fan. This went on for a good 10 seconds and I was about to hang up when I very faintly heard what sounded like Kathy’s voice. Only very muffled and almost impossible to hear. But I knew right away what I was hearing.

It was that laugh. The same one I had heard this morning. Kathy’s voice but not Kathy. I quickly hung up the phone and tried to push it out of my mind. There had to be a reasonable explanation for this but the way my day was going, I didn’t have another second to contemplate it.

6 o’clock arrived in record time and as I was grabbing my jacket from the coat room I bumped into Jen who manned our front desk and spent most of her day forwarding phone calls to the sales staff.

“So did you and your wife have a lunch date or something today?” Excuse me I said, confused. Jen looked up at me while pulling on her winter boots.

“Well, I saw her standing outside by the front windows looking in, and I guess I just assumed she was waiting for you.” “I got called to Marshall’s office, and she was gone when I got back, so I figured you guys had gone out for lunch.”

I looked at her puzzled. “No, we didn’t have lunch plans.”

Did we? I thought. Is it possible we made plans and I forgot? We’ve only met up for lunch a handful of times in the 11 years I’ve worked here, so I doubt that’s something I would have planned for and forgotten about… right?

The drive back home was a slow one due to the slippery road conditions, but I spent the entire time in a daze relaying the moments of the day back over and over again in my head. What was going on? Why had Kathy been standing outside of my office and didn’t even bother to come in and say hi? The way her face had looked this morning staring at me from the kitchen doorway. The way her laugh had sounded from downstairs and then again on, then again on, the creepy voicemail she had left me.

It was creepy, right? Or was I just making something out of nothing? A lack of sleep and a few too many Stella’s the night before? Maybe, but I’d be lying to myself if I said I wasn’t feeling a little bit apprehensive about walking through my front door knowing she was inside waiting for me.

I pulled into the driveway, unlocked the front door, and then quickly realized I had been wrong. I had been wrong about one thing anyways. She wasn’t inside waiting for me.

“Kathy”? I called out. My voice breaking through the silence as I stood inside the front entry of my home. The hallway in front of me stretched out into darkness and the faintly visible green carpet runner that led up to the second level. I reached out for the light switch, but even after the room was lit up, my unease remained. I called out Kathy’s name again but heard nothing. She was always home by 5:30 p.m. The silence was jarring.

Kathy would typically be in the kitchen preparing dinner by now, with a glass of wine and her dinner music playlist playing softly on the Echo speaker. The only sound now was my shoes padding on the stairs as I climbed up towards the bedroom. Another dimly lit hallway stretched out in front of me. The bathroom door mostly closed on my left-hand side, and the bedroom door hung open to my right.

“Kathy”? My voice cracked. I entered the dark bedroom, and my heart stopped. Someone was standing in the far corner of the room. What the hell was going on? Why was she doing this to me? Was this some kind of prank? That made no sense. Kathy had a sense of humour, but this wasn’t it. She would share jokes and cackle out loud at every episode of The Office, but she would never play a cruel prank like this. Would she?

I quickly turned on the light and let out a big sigh of relief when I realized the figure in the corner was just a dress hanging off the open door of Kathy’s armoire. “Jesus,” I said out loud and managed a bit of a laugh. The relief quickly dissipated though, as I still had no idea what the hell was going on.

I took off my ring and put it away, switched off the light, and walked towards the bathroom. Of course, she wasn’t in there, standing quietly in the dark, waiting for me to enter, but I don’t think I would have been surprised to find her there either. That was a crazy thought. This was my wife. Why was my heart pounding in my chest? I splashed water on my face and headed back down the stairs towards the kitchen.

The fluorescent lights lit up the room. The kitchen table stretched to my right just how I had left it, and the modest kitchen island to my left. There was something on the island. I had been in such a rush this morning I hadn’t noticed it. I walked up to the counter and picked up the note that contained my wife’s handwriting.

*John, I’m not sure what time you will be home tonight, but I have to go immediately.*

*I just received a call from my mom. Dad is in the hospital. He was in a serious car accident and is on life support. To make matters worse my cellphone slipped from my hand after I hung up with her, and I can no longer get it to work. I’m sorry I can’t wait for you to get back home. My Uber will be here to take me to the airport in 5 minutes. I won’t be able to call you until tomorrow night. I’ll explain everything and give you an update as soon as I can. Love, Kathy.*

I read the note over and over again. My hands were shaking as I stood there in disbelief.

Who was in the kitchen with me this morning? Who did I hear laughing? Who did Jen see standing outside our office staring inside?

A creak from the top of the stairs snapped me out of my trance. I looked up to see two feet coming out of the darkness. Two feet that began descending down one methodical step at a time. The body and then face slowly came into view as the kitchen light barely lit up the bottom of the staircase. The mouth pulled down in a long grimace. Eyebrows raised high, head titled backwards unnaturally.

A laugh came out of Kathy’s mouth that wasn’t Kathy’s. I screamed.",6,1769740208.0,nosleep,1,0.81,False

1qqswiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1qqswiy/egypt_was_our_cup_of_tea/,Egypt was our cup of tea,"TL;DR I don't understand why Egypt, a very different culture, can incite such extremes in experiences and so many more negative feelings. We had a wonderful stay in Egypt.

My daughter and I went on our own. We planned and made most of the arrangements ahead of time (with some help at times from an in-country hostel/hotel…hosts.). We spent 3 weeks there and had a blast. Yes, we had an Uber driver request cash, and we left the Uber driver that did so. Then an Egyptian explained to us the drivers prefer cash because Uber takes forever to pay the drivers. They like to eat, pay bills and, yup, buy more gas for their cars. We never got double charged. We rode on local buses to Hurghada and on our return to Cairo and were never harassed. Yes, walking the gauntlet to the Uber pickup area at the Cairo airport is an exercise in tenacity. Ditto for the exit from Abu,  just choose the middle path and power walk.

Yes, if you’re not comfortable saying no, Egypt is most likely not a place to visit. We had to say no and no and no, but we just kept on going. If we ended up drinking a tea or coffee, we were comfortable leaving when done. 

Travel tales are what make for interesting experiences and memories. Some tales:

1. Getting dropped off by a taxi driver who had agreed to the Uber rate and tried to negotiate more at arrival. We thought we might have a NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER situation, but it turns out my daughter’s skirt was caught in the closed car door. No, he wasn’t trying to trap my daughter in order to get more money or a kidney. After this lit mom lit a fire under him. I bet he never tried that scam again.

2. Our arrival on Luxor’s west bank occurred during the scheduled but unknown to us nightly power outage. A taxi driver and a tuk tuk driver got into a dispute over who had the honor of driving us to our hotel. We jumped into the tuk tuk and I way overpaid, in order to get to our hotel, after having walked/staggered/tripped in the dark with wheeled suitcases and tired mom feet tottering through the sand and on a partially built walkway. Our driver cheerfully pocketed lots of US dollars, then drove us..say, about 50 feet..to our hotel, lurking in the dark.

3. I lost my phone and eventually used a minimum of Apple skills to track it down. At least 20 Egyptians freely helped try to triangulate its location, in between the hot air balloons taking off. I had never seen such a sight and I never would have seen such a site if the police officer who ""stole"" my phone hadn't shown up every morning for three days in a row, at the Valley of the Kings Hot Air balloon launch site.

There was also the driver who took my daughter to Valley of the Queens and wanted to know how many camels I would take for her (she's one in a million, so what else could I say?). . Lots of people wanted to buy our dollars and we gladly exchanged them. People gave without always expecting in return. I had my suitcase carried up every flight of stairs at every place we stayed (we never stayed at a place with an elevator). The locals told us prices when we asked, so we didn't pay high tourist prices for bottles of water etc. We tipped when we felt it appropriate and ignored many unsolicited requests. Not only did we view the pyramids with awe, you haven't seen anything till you are on a Cairo freeway with NO lane markings and right next to you is a donkey-driven cart. I'll return, to visit the east and west borders I missed and to mark Jordan off my list.",13,1769740017.0,travel,10,0.61,False

Turns out...it was the little stuff.

A drink here.

A snack there.

On random grocery run I didn't plan. Another coffee because I was tired. None of it felt like real spending. But I kept feeling broke anyway.

One night I dumped my bag on the counter and saw all the receipts. It hit me that I wasn't bleeding money in one place...I was leaking it everywhere.

So I started tightening up in small ways instead of trying to make one big change:

1. I stopped buying drinks out and started carrying a water bottle.

2. I keep emergency snacks in my pocket so I don't impulse buy.

3. I plan grocery trips instead of random runs.

4. I try to buy store brands and bulk when I can.

5. I track the small purchases, not just the big ones.

6. Instead of just scrolling on my phone when I'm tired, I use apps that give small rewards for simple things like playing easy games or scanning shopping receipts I already have.

Combined with cutting back on impulse buys, that's what helped me cover about half of my electricity bill this month without waiting for my next paycheck.

That was the first time it felt useful, not just extra change.

I still don't make much.

I still have to be careful 

But I don't feel out of control anymore. The biggest change wasn't a raise. It was paying attention to the invisible spending and making it work for me instead of against me.

If you're struggling and feel like your money just disappears,  look at the small stuff first. That's where mine was hiding.",13,1769740005.0,povertyfinance,17,0.56,False

This is a commonly expressed sentiment in Michel’s videos, and I’m just not watching vlogs for something profound and meaningful, it’s just a way to relax. I like the goofy, lighthearted, mundane vlogs. Like, girl, make coffee, go shopping, clean your house, putter around, do some diy’s. It makes me want to do these things myself.

The need to ”add value” seems like an almost universal projection of unhappiness or feelings of being unfulfilled in their own lives. I didn’t click on a thrifting video for some concept of adding value to my day. I just want to see some fun, funky finds and how you styled them in your home.

I feel like Michel would really find fulfillment if she made some steps towards goals outside of YouTube. I think if she did some part time work doing plating in a restaurant, or work in a cute market or boutique like one she would like to open one day would be good for her. She would gain skills and knowledge towards those passions and goals. If she worked in a little boutique she could learn more about merchandising, consumer trends in her area, and make friends or connections within the space she eventually wants to be. In a restaurant she would literally be immersing herself in the foodie space she loves so much. She would learn new techniques, gain industry contacts, and probably get to eat some really amazing food for free. If she really wants to add value in her content, show people you can learn, pivot, grow, follow your dreams, and work your way up in a different field, even as you’re nearing 30.

I was quite relieved when we met because I was hyped to finally have a work friend, the job is pretty exhausting so it’s nice to have someone to talk to a lil at lunch, you know? Problem is I’m overly friendly to everyone and I think this guy is assuming we’re closer than we really are. The other day he said we’re “best friends” which made me panic a bit because I only wanted a casual work friend, and lately he keeps gifting me things randomly and messaging me every day (especially in the evening 😭) like “how was your day?” And complimenting me about how special and wonderful I am and how grateful he is to have a friend like me.

So again, I’m a HUGE introvert and I actually really treasure solitude. I could go weeks not talking to anyone and be perfectly happy, so being messaged every day is well… suffocating to put it lightly. I’ve also never been rude in my life though, and cannot fathom messaging him about this even in a polite way without stressing out about offending him (I’m a huge overthinker). He’s always messaging me about his problems, relying on me for emotional support and complimenting me excessively… I actually told him I’m asexual and aromantic at Valentine’s Day last year when he asked if I had a partner I was gonna spend the day with (he sorta asked in a subtle casual way like he was baiting for my relationship status…). I was very clear I have no intention of ever having a partner and he seemed really chill agreeing and all, and I’ve repeated a few times that I’m aroace just in general conversation but I still get the impression he’s flirting. Even when he keeps saying “we’re the best of friends” and stuff, it just makes me very uncomfortable. I also worry I’m just being a terrible friend… I think I talk to him in the same friendly way I speak to everyone, he just seems to take it more to heart. I feel bad I don’t consider us very close friends like he does, and feel even worse when he gifts me things I can’t repay (because I don’t tend to gift acquaintances which I consider him to be). Telling him I don’t consider him a close friend just feels like it’d be the meanest thing ever though! I’m trying to be subtle about it like not chatting very often at work, just being generally friendly but not overly familiar but he still messages constantly. I also can’t be too upfront because we WORK together, it’d be so awkward I worry I’d quit just to avoid the embarrassment of confrontation.

As an aroace, the subtle flirting and excess compliments honestly make me feel a little sick… I’m 26 but have never dealt with this in my life, I’ve had such a peaceful time up till now so I hate how uncomfortable I’ve felt lately. So many of my coworkers have asked if we’re in a relationship too, and I constantly have to laugh it off and say I don’t want a partner, ever. To which none of them understand… I’m worried he keeps saying we should hang out after work, but outside the office I’d really rather not. I think I can handle that at least and just say I prefer being alone in my free time as an introvert, which is the truth. Even my closest friends I’ve known since childhood don’t message me very often at all, and we only meet up for coffee and a catch-up once a month but that’s the kind of friendship I value a lot! I love low maintenance people in my life, I know a lot of people might think that’s odd but even if it’s just once a month every time we do meet up we have such a lovely time chatting like it was only yesterday. Other than that I like spending my time playing the piano, going on solo trips and just absorbing myself in my surroundings and zoning out. You know, introvert things. So suddenly after such a peaceful life my entire 26 to have a guy message EVERY day, gift me things at random and over compliment me… it’s like being mentally punched in the stomach, my peace entirely disturbed 🥲 

Any other aroaces had to deal with anything like this? I’ve never actually had anyone flirt with me before or show any interest so this is making me very anxious… My worst nightmare is the idea of a partner, so naturally if he ever does confess I’ll just repeat the fact I’m aroace with zero interest in love. Problem is I also have very little interest in close friendship… Which always makes me feel like such an awful person but I’ve got to prioritize what matters most to me in life, which happens to be my solitude, peace and quiet. I like having casual work friends I can talk to a bit while I’m working, but nothing outside of that beyond a few close friends who are an exception since we’ve been friends our whole life (and we all understand our social batteries aren’t the fullest). Overall, I just want this guy to realise we’re not “best friends”, I don’t want to be the person he goes to whenever he needs life advice, I JUST want someone I can casually chat to on my lunch break like work friends do! abut I also don’t want to be rude… I have an awful habit of being overly cheerful and smiley to everyone, so he probably thinks I’m more invested than I really am. I can’t just stop being friendly though, I seriously just don’t have it in me (I worry a lot about how people perceive me so tend to be overly friendly so I’m less likely to worry about people hating me). If this guy ever thinks I find him annoying, I’d physically feel sick with guilt. So I don’t know how to approach this. I think the core of the problem is that he has a crush on me, which would explain the messaging EVERY day, gifts, compliments, subtle hints etc… maybe I should just be more direct more often about being aroace? Or try to be a bit more distant when messaging? Every time I try that I get overwhelmed with guilt though… if I don’t respond after the first “how was your day today?” He’ll usually repeat it the next day, and I get so embarrassed by how obvious it is I’m ignoring him that I HAVE to respond. I try and respond kindly but not overly keen as a bit of a hint like “I had a good day thank you!” But he always follows up with question after question “what did you do?” And every time I think the conversation is over he asks more questions! I never ask him questions back now despite sounding cheerful, as a sort of hint I don’t want to chat more but he doesn’t take the hint… I also never initiate conversation, thinking he might get that hint but no. And every time I do answer a question he bombards me with compliments like what I said was the most interesting thing in the world like “chatting with you is really making my entire day!” And like… all I said was “I just played a bit of piano”  😭 ",1,1769739708.0,AroAce,0,1.0,False

**\*\*\***

**BEGIN Part I of Vol. 1**

**\*\*\***

""Andy, don't walk there! Hey! WATCH OUT!""

We begin with Andy Parsons, a lanky, pale, freshly unemployed 23-year-old who didn't hear his father because he had already put on his headphones over his mop of brown hair. The massive grand piano and the heavy metal platform on which it rested suddenly detached from the crane Andy was walking under. It fell, squashing him like a pancake.

That old trope where your entire life replays in your brain in the last instant before your death, Andy quickly learned that it was true. In the millisecond before he was crushed, he took stock of things.

The last moment of life, Andy found, extended almost indefinitely. He felt his body pushed into the pavement, the increasing pressure, the beginnings of bones snapping.

His mind wandered through vivid scenes. He saw himself being birthed, nursing, learning to walk. He saw his father, fixing pianos in his shop, showing him how the different pieces were connected. He saw the library his mother had worked at on Saturdays. He wandered the aisles with wonder.

He began to rerun a particular memory. He was in the library at the computer printer. He took a small stack of paper from the ream, about 20 sheets, and snatched a dull pencil from the grotesquely misshapen Goofy coffee mug that had always been there. He took his seat on the floor and began to draw endless, impossible worlds.

Why was Andy, in the infinitely dilated moment of his death, replaying the mundane early childhood memory of drawing on the floor in the public library? It wasn't even a particularly good drawing.

Then Andy remembered how it felt. When he did his drawings, proliferating creatures, making up stories about heroes and villains, gods with strange powers… forgetting himself in the act of pure creation, Andy realized that was the only time he had approached something like true, profound happiness.

He then recalled a few years later in his childhood, working on pianos with his father. Well, being forced to do it. If he had his way, Andy would have been doing something else: drawing, gaming, daydreaming. Anything was better than working on pianos. Maybe it was just the contrarian in him.

Andy recalled the disappointment he always detected running underneath his father's words. The subtle, accusatory inflections.

He never needed help feeling guilty, he was naturally hard on himself. But his father's constant frustration with him, combined with his plain lack of interest in who Andy really was, caused Andy's superego to go into overdrive at an early age.

The ambient guilt grew over the course of his childhood. At first, the guilt was only occasional, when he missed a chore or brought home a less-than-remarkable grade. But, as often happens with developing personalities, something little turned into something big.

That occasional guilt became more steady and less pronounced until it formed the backdrop of who he was. Finally, it calcified into shame. He felt defective even though he didn't want to be. He was always catching up or falling behind, always out of place.

He couldn't find genuine interest in anything but making art, imagining worlds. He would hyperfixate for hours, sketching in his notebook, writing the characters' descriptions and powers. It was his only escape from the laborious monotony of school, chores, and the piano shop; the endless humdrum that everyone else somehow seemed motivated to work on. He really only enjoyed one thing: creating. He gradually found less and less time to devote to his art, but he savored what time he did have. Everything else felt like swimming in concrete.

His mom had been more supportive than his father. She would catch him drawing sometimes and smile.

""You can do something with that you know,"" she always said. ""You've got a talent.""

Andy remembered the warm, elevated feeling he got when she recognized him. He never felt like anyone really understood him, but his mom occasionally came close.

The problem was that art wasn't any way to support yourself, at least according to his dad. In high school, Andy took as many art classes as he could, including the advanced placement course. He was in the middle of applying to art schools when his AP exam results came back. He hadn't passed. So plan B it was: piano sales.

The year following Andy's graduation from high school wrecked his family. Andy's mom suddenly fell ill. The big C, late stage. It sucked. It was hard. But Andy hadn't really cried. He hadn't really, deeply felt much at all.

He remembered staring at a particular crack in the ceiling tile for the entirety of his mother's funeral. He had gradually been numbing himself to reality. He had succeeded all too well. He had made himself a shell.

He was able to work in the piano shop for four years that way. Life around him became an external stimulus that he could allow to pass over him. He retreated into himself, keeping company with podcasts, audiobooks, and music.

But ever since his mother's death, he knew something had to change. Andy knew that, aside from the rare times he was able to lose himself in the creative act, he had never really been happy, and in order to be happy, things couldn't go on as they always had.

Finally the tipping point came. It was during a piano installation. His dad had become irritated at Andy for inadequately fastening the piano to the platform they were using to lift it into their client's second-story living room. It became a screaming match that ended in a challenge to quit. A challenge that Andy accepted. He walked off the job. Well, he didn't make it all the way off the job.

The piano continued to crush him. It was starting to hurt now. It really took death for him to see clearly: he hadn't been doing well at all.

And that is how his earthly life came to a close. He died frustrated, numb, and unfulfilled.

Oh well.

\*\*\*

When Andy came to consciousness, he found himself in a lobby, some kind of drab, windowless government building. Beige walls, navy-blue chairs that were just a bit too small… It was an aggressively uninteresting interior design.

Amenities included an analogue clock, harsh fluorescent lights, and a number of faint stains in the drop-tile ceiling.

There was a clerk behind a plexiglass window, and a few clusters of people seated in the chairs. A few people were sobbing. One guy was chuckling to himself and rocking back and forth.

Where was he? Was this some kind of illusion? Was he still dying under that grand piano? Was this all a dream?

He stood up slowly, taking care to make sure his body was stable. It was. In fact, it felt practically as good as ever. He wore a plain pair of jeans, sneakers, a black teeshirt, and an unbuttoned flannel, the same outfit he had put on earlier that day before he went to work.

*Am I… dead? Like… is this really it?*

He walked over to the clerk's window. Clerks were supposed to help, after all, so if anyone could answer his questions, it’d be the woman behind the glass.

""And how can I help you?"" the clerk said through the intercom. She wore a stiff-looking dress shirt and thick-rimmed glasses, and spoke in a nasally voice with a cheery midwestern accent.

""I'm… here?"" Andy said.

""Yes, ok, well, first of all, welcome to the afterlife. Some people experience a bit of confusion or disorientation when they first arrive. How are you feeling?""

*Afterlife… Yep. Either I’m dead or this is the most bizarre, detailed, and realistic fever dream I’ve ever experienced.*

""I'm feeling fine, physically at least,"" Andy said, suppressing any emotional reaction he might have felt at the fact that he was now dead. Even in death, apparently, his instinct was to remain comfortably numb from his feelings

But even though his mind was racing with anxiety and confusion, his body had never felt better.

""Well that's so good to hear!"" the clerk said. “Many people from earth keep a lifetime of tension in their bodies, especially in the last century or so, so when they arrive, they tend to feel a lot better!”

The clerk continued talking, but Andy zoned out when a thought suddenly occurred to him. If he was truly dead, was his mother here?

He peered at the desk behind the plexiglass. There seemed to be a desktop computer, a boxy one like something from the early 90s, and a keyboard.

“Could I ask you a favor?” Andy said, cutting off the clerk mid-sentence.

“Oh,” she said, blinking and frowning. “Sure, what can I do for you?”

“Can you see if my mother is here? It’s Mary. Mary Parsons.”

“Oh, dear,” the Clerk said, a hint of sadness in her voice. “I wish I could help you, but the network is down.”

“What do you mean?” Andy asked.

""Due to technical difficulties, I don’t have access to our database. And, unfortunately, this is one of many thousands of waiting room sites, so I don’t have an easy answer for you.”

“Oh,” Andy said, trailing off. “Alright.”

“And, probably worse news, we cannot process new arrivals at the moment. But you're welcome to have a seat in the waiting room and we'll get you processed as soon as IT resolves the issue."" She gestured toward the chairs.

""So what's the issue? Anything I could help with?""

""Oh, aren't you sweet! It's for the IT department to handle, honey. But thank you.""

""They have IT departments in heaven?"" Andy asked, trying to get more information out of her. Andy wasn't going to just sit in a waiting room for however long it took. He had become passive in his earthly life, and it had made him a shell of a person. Now, in the afterlife, he resolved to take a more active role.

The clerk smiled politely. ""I don't know about heaven, but we sure do have IT departments here,"" she said.

Andy's stomach sank. He had really messed up his life so bad it sent him to hell.

""Oh don't worry!"" the clerk said as she saw the worry grow on Andy's face. ""You are *not* in H.E. double-hockey-sticks. You're just in a waiting room facility. Doncha worry. We'll process you as soon as possible.""

Andy exhaled a bit and chuckled.

""But *after* processing I'll go to… you know,"" he said as he pointed upwards.

""After the IT issue is resolved, I can check for you,"" she smiled as if to indicate that she had nothing else to say.

Another person, a large man in jeans and a tucked-in polo, materialized in a plastic chair near a dulled metal water fountain. He began to scream.

""You're okay, darlin',"" said the clerk through the intercom. Then she gestured to Andy. ""If you want, you can have a look at our lounge just down the hall.""

Another person popped into existence as Andy headed toward the hallway. Another screamer, met by the clerk's soothing reassurance.

As Andy walked down the hall, the reality of the situation sank in. His life on earth was over, and he hadn’t accomplished much of anything at all. Part of him felt a pang of grief… What had kept him from pursuing the life he wanted?

Earth had been a frustrating place. No matter how hard he worked, he never seemed to get ahead, and every effort Andy made at happiness seemed to result only in frustration. He had dreams early on, but after so much failure and rejection, he had learned to put them out of mind.

Why? Why had he given up so early? Perhaps it made him feel more in control to reject something he couldn’t have. Dreams always seemed to be for other people, not for him.

Andy stepped into the lounge. It was a huge room, resembling something between a skating rink and a casino.The lighting was dim and cozy, the walls had a cheap wood paneling, and the seats and tabletops all had a washed out burgundy hue. The vibe was a Pizza Hut circa 1997.

Andy took a brief scan. There were people sitting in booths lining the walls. There were a few television screens and some arcade games like Crazy Taxi and a claw machine.

There was a large, cushioned bench by a group of pool tables. On the wall above the pool tables there was a large television screen playing daytime TV reruns.

Andy took a seat to collect himself.

""Yeah, there's only one channel,"" a man said from a few seats down, apparently eager to make conversation. ""They're going through every episode of Jerry Springer right now.""

""There's only one channel… and it's nonstop Springer?""

""Well it is right now. It's a marathon. They’re only in 1996 though, and it went until 2018 so we have a ways to go before something else comes on.""

The TV seemed to display a less-than-official VHS tape recording. Occasionally home video would flash through. Jerry Springer tried to keep two guests apart, but they managed to break past him and each grasped the other's throat. They were fighting about someone hooking up with someone else's mother. Andy didn't understand whether or how the two combatants were related. An image of two small children jumping over a water hose in a front yard flashed for a brief moment before giving way to the grappling contestants again. Andy stood up to go.

""Riveting stuff, huh?""

""Yeah… I don't think this is for me,"" Andy said.

""That's too bad,"" said the man adjusting his baseball hat. ""You could go shoot pool with my son if you're looking for something to do,"" he gestured across the room where a small boy, maybe five or six years old, stood on a stool, knocking billiard balls around with the stick like a baseball bat.

""So we just, what, wait here? In this room?""

""Yeah there's the main waiting room, the lounge, which we're in,"" he gestured broadly around the room, ""and there's some kind of intense game room through the curtains over there. Really interesting stuff.""

The man pointed to a set of purplish blue drapes in a doorway that Andy hadn't yet noticed. Now that he saw it, he didn't know how he had missed it. There was a big neon sign that said *THIS WAY TO THE INFINITE PLANE*.

""The infinite plane? What, like an arcade or something?""

""Or something,"" the man said. ""Everyone who walks in there doesn't walk out, so it must be a great game. I heard it described as 'Lawnmower Man plus D&D.'""

Andy didn't know what ""Lawnmower Man"" meant, maybe it was a game from this man's time or something. But he *did* know a thing or two about D&D. In fact, the mention of it gave him a little jolt of excitement. The kind of excitement that he felt all those years ago in the library.

He had never had a friend group big enough or interested enough to actually play, but he had used D&D books as a reference for drawing his heroes. He had been captured by the artistic depictions of fighters, mages, and monsters.

""Why aren't you and your kid playing, then?"" Andy asked. ""If there's a great game in there, why is anyone out here at all?""

""Well for me, my boy isn't ready for the game yet. We've only been here a couple of weeks, so we're taking our time.""

""Wait… weeks? Has the technical difficulty lasted that long?""

""Oh,"" he looked surprised. ""The whole system has been down for over a century, apparently. There are even some people who have been here since the late 1800s.""

Andy felt a pang of panic in his throat. *People have been living over a century in the equivalent of a painfully understaffed department of motor vehicles?*

""How long is it going to take?""

""Whaddaya mean?""

""Until the system is back up and we can go… wherever we're going.""

""Oh, nobody knows,"" the man said. ""Apparently there's a critical issue with an update and they need the admin password. But the only guy who has it isn't here.""

""Wait, the whole system is dependent on one guy?""

""Yeah, I guess. Some IT guy named Frank.""

""Why would they build it that way? Have they not heard of redundancy before?""

""I don't know what to tell you, man, I've mostly been watching TV.""

Andy paused, taking in the new information. The IT system had been down for over a century, which meant he wasn’t getting out of here any time soon. The only objective that had crossed his mind so far was finding his mom, but as the clerk had pointed out, it was unlikely to happen without help from a database.

He had spent his life frustrated and unable to find happiness, and it seemed like the afterlife would be no different.

At least he didn’t have to work a dead-end job and there was an intriguing video game. Hopefully it didn’t suck, but Andy didn’t want to get his hopes up.

""I'm Glenn, by the way,"" he said, extending his hand.

""Andy,"" said Andy, accepting Glenn's handshake. ""And you haven't thought about jumping in the game?""

""Well, no,"" said Glenn. ""My son isn't ready. He said he's scared of it. But I'm sure once he gets more comfortable he'll be all for it and we'll give it a go. For now, we gotta stick together and I don't mind being a couch potato. Never had time to be lazy in my life before. We were lucky enough to have each other coming here together. If you're lucky enough to find yourself with people you love, you've got to stick together.""

Glenn watched with a look of gratitude and admiration as his son continued to whack the pool balls.

The thought of waiting in the lobby for decades shook Andy. The clerk had mentioned that this wasn't hell, but it seemed pretty close.

It seemed like there were more important things going on than a roleplaying game, but there wasn't much to do about it. Andy did know one thing, though: the waiting room promised only daytime TV runs and infinite boredom.

""I think I'm going to scope out the game room,"" he said. ""Cheers, Glenn.""

""Well, if we make it in there, maybe we'll seeya 'round in the game, Andy.""

I know this is likely from me being a cheek biter (lifelong habit I’m trying to break) but am I going to just continue this cycle or is there something else I should consider? I also have some embarrassing decalcification. I’ve been using PreviDent once daily for almost a year (minimum 3-4 nights a week) along with almost daily flossing and minimum daily brushing for my adult life (I do my best for 2x daily). I did NOT take care of my teeth until I started college… there’s nothing I can do there as I’m not a 32 yo. Is there something I can do to help with the chipping, and/pr decalcification? 

He advised me not to whiten them as that could lead to even more noticeable discoloration. I’ve thought about orthodontics to address the crowding on my bottom teeth, but I was told my crossbite cannot be addressed so the teeth straightening would be for aesthetics only… I just don’t know what to do other than just give up on having better looking teeth. I don’t even know what to ask my dentist for or about… 

for background I’m a coffee drinker, never smoked, and I used to be a heavy soda drinker. I currently drink soda periodically but it’s no longer an every day occurrence. I drink coffee and plain water mostly. Not sure if it’s relevant but I’ve had 3 pregnancies with 2 being full term births (I’ve heard it can affect your teeth). I could afford to put some money into my teeth, but I’m more willing to pay for a better bite than pure aesthetics. I’m a teeth clincher, not a grinder, but the cheek biting is a work in progress 🥲 I knew it was likely damaging my teeth but I never had it happen as I was actively biting my cheeks until tonight.

This is still at the interest-check stage, so I’m not here to hard sell. Just genuinely trying to see:

Who might need bulk coffee
What quantities people usually buy
What matters most (price, consistency, roast level, sourcing, etc.)

run a café

Here’s mine!  First of all, I love this release. After the disappointment of 2025, I have been starving for some good Baggu and they are finally giving us some good food. These notes are not critiquing or lamenting, just thoughts.

1.) The colors read a little more like fall colors but they are actually a very avant garde selection for spring and I’m loving it. I think the palette works well as accessories to a spring palette you might already have instead of the statement piece - they are there to contrast and highlight your pastel or bright spring wardrobe like a bold parentheses. Why release the same colors everyone else does in spring when you can release contrast pairing colors?! I love it, it’s exactly what an accessory should do. Also, the pallet is giving fresh earth instead of fresh flowers, which is often an unexplored and under represented part of spring.

2.) the entire release is an excellent balance between sophisticated and fun/whimsical. I think Baggu is trying to get into the sophisticated accessory category but they lost their identity along the way and were missing the mark with what they were trying to enter that arena with (recycled leather bags, pochettes, drawstring). Then they steered too far into the “playful” to try to recover and ended up in the kids department (Sanrio collabs). This collection brings them back to center, and offers heavyweight contenders to the sophisticated bag arena without alienating their original market.

3.) I LOVE the loaf bag. It’s what the pochette should have been. Baggu is a bag for people who like to overstuff their bag. The loaf keeps a sexy lil purse profile while holding a water bottle - THATS their differentiator from every other brand that has a sexy little bag. Side note, I wouldn’t be surprised if the loaf is featured heavily in the UOs drop - those people love their sexy little purses.

4.) Coffee is a wonderful neutral brown - it doesn’t have too much of either red or blue tones so it can be matched with literally anything. Fuchsia and Deep Sea are great colors on their own but personally I can’t stop being reminded of how every outdoor clothing company has only offered magenta and teal as color options for women for like decades.

5.) I love the blurred gingham brown and abstract. I love the fun optical illusions they create and I think they are very unique. The fuzzy vision is very fun to me. I know there has been a lot of hate on those but at least the bag I want the most won’t sell out 😅

6.) If I could add a bag to this collection, I would have done an embroidered bunny crescent or bowler. Or just brought a little more of the carrots, berries, bunnies etc into these bags in general. I love what’s been put out, but I really want a fun pattern in these styles. And that bunny is so cute.

7.) the only thing I’m genuinely disappointed in is I would have loved for puffy slippers in the Bunny pattern.

8.) Real Hot Take: Cherries for spring when figs were right in front of you??!!

Those are my hot takes! I’m going to spend the next few days planning my spring wardrobe - it’s been so cold I can’t wait to wear my cute clothes again and have a new bag to style them with!",9,1769739422.0,BAGGU,5,1.0,False

Can’t wait for the weekend to chill, unwind and hopefully get some good rest! :) 

Well… speaking of unwinding! I decided to do the most unusual thing tonight and I’m actually having a glass of wine in the bath tub! Hang on… maybe, I’m on the second or third already… lol. I think I can still carry a great conversation, as long as I can type though haha. 

Seriously, how are you doing? I wanna know! How was your week? Doing anything exciting tonight or staying in and keeping warm like me? This cold a&& weather on the east coast is real though. Can’t wait to get back to the golden state and enjoy some pretty sunshine. 

Aside for all this chatter, I’m totally in the mood to just hangout and keep a conversation going as long as you can:) I wouldn’t even mind sharing snps, or we can connect on here, as long as the chemistry is good:) 

If you are a coffee lover, fan, an enthusiast, pet owner/lover, enjoy books, traveling or being out in nature then I’m almost confident we gonna kick it well and even become best friends (possibly) haha. I’d say about 90% chance! Only thing that can make it 100% if you happened to be charismatic, witty, a bit charming, a bit of a flirt… and with some seduction in you! I genuinely believe that seduction is a pure form of art! 

Okay… still reading I see? Thanks haha. So how about you hit me with a really cool icebreaker and you answer this question then? Since you made it this far (kudos). Haha

Would you prefer dinner first then romance or the other way around? —- :)

Ngl work has been kicking my ass lately and I’ve really been craving those day-to-day yap sessions I used to have with friends in grad school. but since moving cities that’s become more and more rare, so I figured I’d try meeting some new people here!

A bit about me: I’m a great cook, I love finding new music, I’m well traveled, and I enjoy watching sports (NFL and F1 mostly), playing video games, and making coffee. Always down to swap movie/show recommendations too.

I’d really like to meet someone around my age who’s kind, curious about other cultures (I'm Arab/Mexican myself), got a good sense of humor, and who actually puts in effort to get to know others.

So you like to yap and want to see if we click, hit me up and tell me a bit about yourself! Ideally looking for someone near my age timezone (MST) :)",2,1769739210.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Porta filter: 51, (14g max coffee grind)


Coffee bean: mild arabica and mild robusta


Espresso taste: a. Bitterness: purely menace. b. Sourness: kinda so-so? 



Hindi ako marunong mag coffee taste since this is my first puro lang ako cold & hot brew. Ganito ba talaga ang espresso sobrang bold ng lasa parang bbalik n lang ako sa cold brew pero nahandito na yung machine. 



P.s. 


napansin ko din sa steamer niya d umiikot ako ba yung mali or yung machine? Nag tilt naman ako, na paso n nga finger tips ko. (any lahome machine user here?)
