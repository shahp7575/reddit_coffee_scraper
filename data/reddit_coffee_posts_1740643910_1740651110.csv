I hadn‚Äôt intended to. But I did anyway. I wasn‚Äôt feeling great, and decided I was going to do an early 48 hour fast. I do 1 or 2 of those a week. Then thought, ah sure, what‚Äôs the harm? None, it turned out. 


I was very hungry at times, but not more than usual. By the third day, the hunger had gone. I ate because I felt I should. 


It was a dirty fast as there was tea and coffee with milk. There was plenty of water. There was no pain, though. At one point, I considered extending it for another day or so. Then chickened out. 


I was pleased about how normal it felt. I know that sounds strange, especially as I do regularly 48 hour fasts and am OMAD the rest of the time. I expected it to be hard, or require some extra effort. It didn‚Äôt.  I‚Äôd definitely do this again.

All welcome!,"There have been a lot of 'finding new friends' posts recently so I thought it'd be a good time to post this.  We usually have [at least one of these meetups](https://wiki.glasgow.social/reddit) every month - it's just a social hang out with some drinks - there are some folk who have been coming for years, and there'll be plenty of people there for the first time, so it's a good event to find some people who are looking to meet new friends.

**Where?**  
It's in [The Gamer Club](https://www.thegamerclub.co.uk) at 153 Bath Lane, Glasgow, G2 4RH.  There are details on how to find the venue on our [getting here](https://www.thegamerclub.co.uk/gettinghere) page.

**When?**  
Friday 28th Feb 2025, from 8pm until late.

**What to expect?**  
It's just a social hang out.  Join us for an hour or two for some drinks and chat (or stay the whole night!).  There'll be some people playing games like Guitar Hero or Mario Kart that you are welcome to join, but most people will just be milling around chatting and getting to know each other.  We print name tags and the organiser will try and introduce new folk to each other.  There'll be around 50 people at the event, but as we have multiple rooms you can find quieter spaces if you need some time out.

**What to bring?**  
The venue is unlicenced (and doesn't sell anything) so please bring along your own beer, wine or soft drinks, snacks etc.  There is a kitchen where you can help yourself to free tea and coffees.

**Do I need to RSVP?**  
It's not mandatory, but it helps us pre-print name tags.  You can [RSVP here](https://meetup.glasgow.social/events/7d0428d0-f0af-45a9-a1b7-9ab349424140).

**Do I need to be a member to come?**

The library was this communal space that ‚Äì quiet or not ‚Äì had tons of other people reading, discussing classes, analyzing and trying to make sense of information. Whenever I went to the library, I knew I would be left alone, but that I could be at the same time surrounded by focused individuals.

The way libraries are built also makes them the ideal place to study, in my opinion. All around you there are books, full of knowledge. You are in the midst of human wisdom. Doing bibliographic research in the library sorts of helped me imagine myself as a detective, looking for clues in the enormous amount of information around me. And there was momentum created through seeing everyone else around you study too.

But since I started doing bibliographic research in an office, I am struggling to stay focused. I don‚Äôt really find that same vibe where the world around you made you feel inspired to look for answers. I would just love if there was a mini library in the office, a quiet place where you could go and bury yourself in literature, unaware of your posture, your resting face.

Imagine maneuvering thousands of satellites and handling the data equivalent of a billion Google searches every second‚Äîall while sipping your morning coffee in zero gravity. That's the future AWS is sketching out, according to insights shared at Booz Allen Hamilton‚Äôs Space + AI Summit.

AWS is pushing the frontier with AI and machine learning (ML) as essential tools for space operations. We're talking about a future where 'Houston, I have a problem' transforms into 'Houston, I've got a solution'‚Äîall thanks to in-situ AI systems on celestial missions. Fancy Astrophysical Edge Computing (AEC) to handle cosmic data overload? AWS is on it, designing purpose-built technology to overcome the unique challenges of space's harsh environment.

With over 10,000 satellites now swirling in low Earth orbit, the need for advanced AI has skyrocketed (pun very much intended). Processing data on-board rather than sending it back to Earth has cut bandwidth needs by almost half‚Äîa game-changing development for the space industry.

But it's not all smooth sailing through the stars. As AWS optimizes hardware against solar radiation and limited power in space, ethical quandaries loom large. What happens when AI becomes the final arbitrator in life-and-death astronaut scenarios? The Three Laws of Robotics might need a cosmic upgrade.

Avoid Angel Inn and Microbreweries in town incidentally,"I sparked up a conversation with a lady in her early twenties in a coffee shop.  

We are both looking for work (I'm in a job and looking for another one).  

She was telling me about an interview at Angel Inn and Microbrewery on Stoney St. Apparently the most disrespectful interview she'd ever been to. Minimum wage & the interviewer stated they hadn't decided whether to put the 'successful' candidate on PAYE or self employed. Should put this on ad as many candidates won't work on a self employed basis, just often better for employers as they can evade statutory employment rights etc. 

Apparently every comment she made the interviewer put her down like she was talking nonsense.  

Apparently the interviewer stated 'you will just do what I tell you to do!' rudely when talking the interviewer asked about what part of the job entailed. 

This is just disgusting and very poor management.  

She was then ghosted after the interview, they couldn't be bothered to follow up with her and show the slightest respect. 

I would have walked out, I'm quite a bit older and just won't be spoken to like that. 


I've been in to the Angel a couple of times to drink and eat but would avoid mostly as the staff are just clueless and rude. 


This attitude is out of sync with my interview experiences in Nottingham which have mostly been decent.

None of this works. I tried the annoying app with multiple tasks. I solve them and I go back to sleep. I tried to put my phone far away. Same thing. 

I never had so much difficulty to not snooze and get moving. 

Of course if I know I have to wake up to catch a train or something else then I do it. So I feel so sad that I can't be strong enough to wake up just for me...

Coworking spaces have come a long way from being just open-plan offices with shared desks and coffee stations. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) and cutting-edge technology are transforming these spaces into dynamic, highly efficient, and personalized environments that cater to the evolving needs of freelancers, startups, and corporate teams alike.

# Smart Workspaces: More Than Just a Desk

The days of manually booking conference rooms or hunting for an empty desk are fading fast. AI-driven space management tools now allow members to reserve workstations and meeting rooms in real-time through smart apps. These systems analyze usage patterns and optimize space allocation to reduce congestion and enhance productivity. Imagine walking into a coworking space where your preferred desk is already reserved, the lighting is adjusted to your preference, and the coffee machine knows your go-to order. That‚Äôs not the future‚Äîit‚Äôs happening now.

# AI-Powered Networking and Collaboration

One of the biggest perks of coworking spaces is networking. AI is making this process seamless and more effective. Smart algorithms analyze members‚Äô interests, industries, and skills to suggest relevant connections, making networking more organic and fruitful. Some coworking spaces even use AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to facilitate introductions, recommend events, or schedule meetups with like-minded professionals.

# Enhanced Security and Access Control

Security is a major concern in shared work environments. AI-driven facial recognition and biometric access control are replacing traditional keycards, ensuring only authorized individuals enter designated areas. Machine learning algorithms continuously monitor security footage, flagging any unusual activity in real time. This not only enhances security but also creates a seamless, keyless experience for members.

# The Role of IoT in Creating Smart Environments

The Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a crucial role in shaping coworking spaces. Smart thermostats, automated lighting, and air quality sensors create a comfortable and energy-efficient work environment. IoT-enabled desks can even adjust their height based on user preferences, ensuring ergonomic comfort throughout the day. Such innovations not only improve well-being but also contribute to sustainability by reducing energy waste.

# AI for Productivity and Well-being

AI doesn‚Äôt just manage spaces; it also enhances productivity and well-being. Noise-canceling smart pods, AI-driven meditation and focus apps, and real-time feedback on workspace ergonomics are helping workers maintain a balanced and efficient workday. Some coworking spaces are even integrating AI-based wellness programs that analyze stress levels and suggest personalized breaks or wellness activities.

# The Future of AI in Coworking Spaces

As AI and technology continue to evolve, coworking spaces will become more adaptive, intuitive, and responsive to individual and business needs. The future will see hyper-personalized experiences, AI-driven concierge services, and even robotic assistants helping with mundane tasks. The goal? To create workspaces that foster innovation, collaboration, and well-being effortlessly.

Technology is no longer just an add-on in coworking spaces‚Äîit‚Äôs the backbone that makes them smarter, safer, and more efficient. The question isn‚Äôt whether AI will reshape coworking spaces; it‚Äôs how soon your workspace will catch up!",1,1740649935.0,u_healthyskinclub,0,1.0,False

I just got back from a work / pleasure combo trip to London, where I found myself in need of a magic bag that fulfills a whole bunch of needs. I've spent a few hours googling but haven't found anything that ticks all the boxes. 

Here's the situations it needs to cater for:

- Can use it as a work bag and carry a 14in MacBook pro, A5 notebook, water bottle, small makeup pouch, small umbrella, and snack. 
- Can use it for a day out shopping, where I can carry the above minus the laptop, but instead throw in a sweater if I get too warm
- Can use it to go out, and carry a pair of heels on the way and a pair of sneakers while at the bar/restaurant
- Needs to either be my personal item while traveling, or pack down into my carry-on
- Needs to ZIP! UP! Since it gets used in big cities where pickpockets abound. Also so nobody can see my spare shoes when I'm trying to look elegant üòÖ
- Shoulder bag or crossbody, so I have my hands free to hold a coffee in one hand and an umbrella in the other üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I don't need compartments or many interior pockets. Just one easily accessible one for my phone (and maybe passport).

In terms of aesthetic:
- Probably black
- Real leather. I'm partial to pebbled and saffiano
- Not bulky
- Sleek, elegant, but not overly serious or businessy. I have the Coccinelle Boheme which would tick all the boxes if it came one size up. I adore the playful strap.

I have had issues with frequent/high levels of urination for many years, but all the usual medical tests have come back fine, so I'm trying to eliminate caffeine from my diet to see if that helps.

From Canada to the Netherlands: Village Farms' Leli Holland releases first products from their Dutch cultivation
Leli Holland, one of the growers participating in the closed cannabis chain experiment in the Netherlands, has recently released its first products from the first harvest of its indoor cultivation. The company is owned by Village Farms International (NASDAQ: VFF), which has already been active in the cannabis space in Canada with operations like Pure Sunfarms‚Äîone of the few cannabis growers that have managed to stay profitable since recreational cannabis was regulated in North America.
""Cannabis is very complicated to grow at high quality,"" says Orville Bovenschen, President of Leli Holland and Pure Sunfarms. ""For instance, tomatoes are planted once a year. With cannabis, you do many cycles a year, and you try to standardize each cycle as much as you can.""
From Canada (back) to the Netherlands

That experience, along with having a horticultural juggernaut like Village Farms behind them, proved instrumental to the success of Leli Holland's first harvest‚Äîand also in navigating the cannabis space in the Netherlands. ""We have 25-30 years of horticultural experience,"" Orville points out. This made it easier for them to find banks, and insurance companies, and reassure the government that operations at Leli Holland were going to meet expectations.
On top of that, Village Farms is inextricably tied to the Dutch horticulture scene. ""We collaborate with WUR, and we use a lot of Dutch tech and growing techniques in all of our greenhouses‚Äîtomatoes and cannabis alike."" That's why Village Farms entered the Dutch cannabis experiment by acquiring a license; they felt it was a natural step to be active in a country where both cannabis and horticulture have deep societal roots.
At the facility in the Netherlands, Orville said they used LED lighting for the first time. ""I'm quite happy with those,"" he says. ""Back in 2017, when I was converting a tomato greenhouse, the LED tech wasn't there. It's shocking to see how fast it has evolved. When you start using them, it's kind of like learning how to grow all over again.""
A wealth of horti knowledgeConsistency is the most difficult thing to achieve, but Leli Holland could rely on the wealth of knowledge coming from Village Farms. ""The team in Canada and the team in the Netherlands talk to each other,"" Orville says. ""But generally speaking, all of Village Farms' growers ask for help and advice from each other. There's this cross-pollination of knowledge throughout the Village Farms ecosystem that truly makes our growers' jobs easier.""
And perhaps that's also why the first harvest at Leli Holland turned out better than anticipated. ""Usually, the first cycle isn't that good, as you are still dialing in the system and seeing if everything works,"" explains Orville. ""But what we got really surprised us. I'm very happy with the quality of our products.""
That also has to do with the genetics they grow, which come from Canada, from Village Farms itself. ""We work on our own genetics, developing new strains and doing tissue culture in Canada. Some of those genetics are already here in the Netherlands."" Others are also expected to find their way to Holland, such as Pink Kush, which Orville claims is the ""number one strain sold globally in a legal market.""

Direct customer feedback For now, cannabis flower is coming out of the Leli Holland facility, but in the future, more products will be developed‚Äîcoming straight from Village Farms' Canadian experience. ""We will bring all those kinds of product innovations that you can find in North America,"" says Orville. ""We've seen that Dutch consumers are very interested in them. We are also very eager to hear some direct feedback.""
Unlike in Canada, where growers need to sell their product to a liquor board, which then sells it to dispensaries, in the Netherlands, growers sell directly to coffee shops. ""There's some delay in terms of feedback in Canada. But in the Netherlands, we can directly ask coffee shops how our products are received, what is good, and what can be improved.""
In the Dutch cannabis chain experiment, there's no cap on the amount of flower one can grow‚Äîa grower is only limited by the maximum output of their facility. ""But we are very prudent not to create excess inventory. We always err on the side of caution when it comes to that.""
The direct relationship with retail fronts will come in handy for Leli Holland, as the question of whether supply will be enough to meet demand is still lingering. ""At the moment, anyway, we just sold our first batch, and we are in the process of further optimizing the existing footprint and product quality.""

# 2. Better Quality and Craftsmanship

Local artisans often use high-quality materials and traditional techniques that enhance the durability and beauty of furniture. Handmade furniture is usually more robust than factory-made alternatives.

# 3. Customization Options

Many artisans promote their work on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest. Searching for local furniture makers using hashtags or location-based searches can help you discover talented craftsmen.

# 3. Check with Hotel Furniture Suppliers

Many **hotel furniture suppliers** collaborate with local artisans to offer unique, handcrafted pieces. Ask your supplier if they source from local craftspeople or if they can recommend any.

# 4. Visit Workshops and Studios

If you want a hands-on experience, visit artisan workshops and studios in your area. This allows you to see how the furniture is made and discuss your specific needs directly with the craftsmen.

# 5. Ask for Recommendations

Word-of-mouth referrals from other hotel owners, interior designers, or business networks can help you connect with reliable artisans who specialize in high-quality hotel furniture.

# Choosing the Right Artisans for Your Hotel Furniture

Once you‚Äôve found a few potential artisans, you need to evaluate their work and business practices to ensure they can meet your requirements. Here‚Äôs how:

# 1. Examine Their Portfolio

Ask artisans for a portfolio of their previous work. This will give you an idea of their craftsmanship, style, and ability to create furniture that matches your hotel‚Äôs aesthetic.

# 2. Discuss Customization Options

If you have specific requirements for **hotel chairs**, tables, or beds, discuss customization options with the artisan. Check if they can modify designs, use specific materials, or create furniture in custom sizes.

# 3. Check Material Quality

The quality of materials used in furniture affects its durability and maintenance. Ask artisans about the types of wood, metal, or fabrics they use and ensure they meet your quality standards.

# 4. Understand Their Pricing and Payment Terms

Handcrafted furniture can be more expensive than mass-produced alternatives, but it‚Äôs often worth the investment. Discuss pricing, payment terms, and whether they offer bulk discounts for large hotel projects.

# 5. Inquire About Lead Time

Since handmade furniture takes time to create, check how long the artisan will take to complete your order. This is especially important if you are furnishing an entire hotel and need multiple pieces.

# 6. Request a Sample Piece

Before placing a large order, ask for a sample piece to assess the craftsmanship, durability, and overall quality of the furniture. This will help you avoid surprises when you receive the final batch.

# Key Hotel Furniture Pieces You Can Source from Local Artisans

Here are some important furniture items you can get handcrafted by artisans:

# 1. Hotel Chairs

Handmade **hotel chairs** can add a stylish and comfortable touch to your hotel‚Äôs dining areas, lobbies, or guest rooms. Look for well-crafted, sturdy chairs made from wood, metal, or upholstered fabric.

# 2. Hotel Tables

Locally made tables, whether for dining rooms, lounges, or guest rooms, can add a rustic and authentic appeal to your interiors. Choose from solid wood, stone, or metal designs depending on your hotel‚Äôs theme.

# 3. Hotel Beds

A high-quality, handmade bed frame adds elegance and durability to your hotel rooms. Custom bed frames can be designed to match your room aesthetics while ensuring maximum comfort for guests.

# 4. Reception and Lobby Furniture

A hotel‚Äôs lobby sets the first impression, and artisan-made furniture such as sofas, coffee tables, and decorative pieces can enhance its appeal.

# 5. Outdoor Furniture

If your hotel has an outdoor dining or lounge area, consider sourcing durable, handcrafted outdoor furniture that can withstand weather conditions.

# 6. Decorative Pieces and Accessories

Locally crafted mirrors, wall art, lamps, and other decorative elements can add a personalized and cultural touch to your hotel‚Äôs interiors.

# Negotiating with Local Artisans

When working with artisans, it‚Äôs important to establish clear communication and fair business practices. Here‚Äôs how to negotiate effectively:

# 1. Be Respectful and Build Relationships

Approach artisans with respect and an appreciation for their craftsmanship. Building a good relationship can lead to better deals and long-term collaboration.

# 2. Order in Bulk for Discounts

If you need a large number of furniture pieces, negotiate bulk discounts. Many artisans are willing to offer lower prices for bigger orders.

# 3. Be Clear About Deadlines

Ensure that the artisan understands your project timeline and agrees to deliver the furniture on time.

# 4. Discuss Warranty or Repairs

Ask if the artisan provides any warranty on their furniture and if they offer repair services in case of any issues.

# Challenges of Sourcing Hotel Furniture from Local Artisans

While buying from local artisans has many benefits, there are also some challenges to consider:

# 1. Longer Production Time

Handcrafted furniture takes longer to make than mass-produced pieces. If you are on a tight schedule, plan ahead to avoid delays.

# 2. Higher Costs

Handmade furniture can be more expensive due to labor-intensive craftsmanship and high-quality materials. However, the durability and uniqueness often justify the cost.

# 3. Limited Production Capacity

Small-scale artisans may not be able to produce large quantities of furniture quickly. If you need a high volume of furniture, you may need to work with multiple artisans.

# 4. Logistics and Delivery

Local artisans may not have proper delivery services, so you may need to arrange transportation yourself.

# Final Thoughts

Sourcing hotel furniture from local artisans is a great way to create a unique, high-quality, and sustainable hotel interior. Handmade **hotel chairs**, tables, beds, and decorative pieces can add an authentic and personalized touch to your space. While it may take more time and effort to find the right artisans, the benefits of customization, craftsmanship, and supporting the local economy make it a worthwhile investment.

I have no idea why, but after I took it tonight something prompted me to look up proper dosage which I‚Äôm feeling so stupid for not doing prior to now. 

I am 27 years old, 5‚Äô3 and I am a little overweight at about 150lbs. History of Lymphoma from age 15-16. I live in Michigan so it‚Äôs common for people in my area to have low Vitamin D levels. I see my oncologist every year for testing and my vitamin d levels are always low and I always say I‚Äôll take it and never do but finally this past year I have been very good about it and I go back for my yearly checkup within the next couple of months. My oncologist offered to prescribe the Vitamin D but due to insurance issues it was actually cheaper for me to just buy it over-the-counter. So, me, not thinking AT ALL, just grabbed the only bottle available at the grocery store (125mcgs). 

Anyways. 

1. Is it possible that I have harmed myself and have essentially been ‚Äúoverdosing‚Äù the past 10ish months? 

2. Should I maybe take it just once in a while instead of everyday? Like once a week? 


Yes I understand I should probably contact my doctor or pharmacist. But this just occurred to me this moment and it‚Äôs very late at night so this is just a first step. 

Also, I feel fine. I‚Äôm nauseous daily which can be a symptom of Vitamin D toxicity but I have other issues that I think cause it like too much coffee and not eating enough lol. ",1,1740647322.0,Supplements,3,1.0,False

Me (F32) and my husband(M36) have been together for nearly 12years(married for 6) with 3 beautiful kids.

Our relationship started amazing, we were 2 pees in a pot and a match made in heaven. This all started to change after our oldest was a couple of months old, or even during the pregnancy(stress which i understood for a man it's harder to adjust to a newborn seeing they don't carry it for 9months)

During the first 2years of our oldest we had a lot of arguments and disagreements, again very normal for a young couple with a newborn. For me the change happend when he yelled towards our oldest that he will learn it differently when he is with him in the weekends(divorce in the backmind), over the months it got better and we started to communicate again.

When we got married he only asked me(offcialy to marry him) 2 weeks before our wedding(booked and invites sended), this for me was a big deal seeing I only want to marry once and for me our love and dedication to each other doesn't change just because of a piece of paper. This because I'm very old fashioned for my age(me and my friends always joke around that im a 50s wife), hence why I started to work part-time before we got pregnant, to make sure I can be home for our kids and be a proper wife for him. I did everything including working 28hours, household/kids/working/etc, I never expect him to do anything in the household because he works fulltime and if he is home I prefer him spend the time that's left with the kids then on the choirs.

The communication goes up an down, with arguments as result. All of this is happening while his parent is going through chemo, gets declared clean and sick again(over 8years, passed away 4years ago). Fast forward to the birth of our youngest with most of the things on my plate(renovated a home, getting pregnant while the second was only months old and needed to say goodbye to my parent in law) I slipped in a postnatal depression and ooh boy this was a hard battle to fight, but I won! I'm still battling daily with this, but now nearly 4years later I can say I'm doing better every day and finding back myself as the mum I always was and wanted to be.

Now I'm in remission and my husband is battling his own depression for 4years(after passing of his parent he slipped) i have been begging him to go to therapy for himself and even gave him an ultimatum for couple counseling(I was having my own therapy for postnatal) which he took positively and we went to counselling.
I needed him to show me the effort of wanting to go and fix us, so he was in charged of booking the appointments. He stopped doing this after a couple of times, when in my opinion he felt it was going well enough between us and just stopped. He never gave me a reason for why he stopped booking, with 3 kids and a household to run(about to buy our second home and needed to be renovated as well).

While I was going through postnatal and all the hormonal changes that it bring being post partum. My husband confessed that he hit a camera in the house to see if I would cheat?!(again I'm a very old fashioned wife, yes I grew up with a boy household but I never did anything to give him this doubt) He took the camera away and said he would work on his trust towards me, in my opinion without trust no relationship(love isn't enough).
This crack in his trust, broke me! I felt unworthy, not enough and worse of all it made me very insecure about everything(this ontop of the already massive doubt from the postnatal depression), but seeing of our history, kids and his remorse i stayed and we tried again.

Me going fully in mom mode and trying to make sure the house is ready for our move etc the time flew by. With all the stress of the renovating and the horrible move(different story) the time flew by, but we settled in our new home!

In my mind everything is going bliss and yes there are struggles(intimacy and communication from him to me) but in which relationship are there no ups and downs(again old fashion; for better AND worse). He know s*x and trust are my biggest issues, I think intimacy is very important in your relationship(that's why I never gave myself to every best dude in my life) and trust because not everyone in my close family was trustworthy because they lied and cheated. so I learned very young that if someone has trust issues they are most likely not trustworthy theirselfs.

But now my problem;
*I'm still not over the camera incident
*he keeps making odd statements hinting at my trustworthiness(which i point out and he never means it that way)
*he asked while having s*x if I was even faithful to 1 c*ck(which again broke my corn  because of the vulnerable position I was in)
*I want/need him to show me an effort that he wants me and not just because I'm the mother of our children
*he says he is to occupied with his own battle against depression to fully give me an effort(while I'm very easy and more then willing to settle for bare minimum; coffee in bed for valentine or candles on with dinner)
But he says that he did alot of effort with those special days and it doesn't even do a difference apparently.

Not sure what to do to make this marriage work for the both of us. I just want him and our kids to be happy. 

At this point I'm just ranting and not even sure anymore what to say. If something needs to be explaind just ask

I just want an outsiders perspective to see what to do or to find tips/insides I didn't think about..

1izbhoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1izbhoy/i_just_turned_21_and_i_created_a_cocktail_that_is/,I just turned 21 and I created a cocktail that is earning unanimous praise - how unique is it though?,"I just turned 21 in November. As someone who doesn't like beer or wine very much, cocktails have been the way to go. Now that I'm spending time in bars, mixology itself has interested me so I decided to take a crack at creating a cocktail. 

I call it a Garden Party. It's basically an amped up gin and tonic that is bright and citrusy at first, then turns floral before ending with a strong green tea finish. It has a really nice golden amber color and feels like something that I should be drinking in the summer by a pool, but oh well.

I have served it to everyone I know, and so far, I have received nothing but praise. Not to pat myself on the back too much, but the consensus seems to be that it both tastes amazing and is unlike anything else they have had before (considering that my reviewers are college students, that doesn't necessarily mean too much). So I'm curious if this is similar to any other known drinks. Here is the recipe:

**The Garden Party**

**Jasmine Tea Infusion**

Ingredients for Infusion:
* 1 bottle of floral gin (The Botanist works great)
* 2 tbsp loose-leaf jasmine tea

Instructions:
1. Add the jasmine tea and gin into a glass mason jar
2. Steep in fridge for 6-12 hours ‚Äì Taste every hour if possible to prevent gin becoming too bitter
3. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer first, then a coffee filter 
4. Return the infused gin to the bottle

Note: While the gin shouldn't be too bitter, it should have a very strong tea flavor too it. Some bitterness is expected and you can always adjust the amount of simple syrup to counteract it if needed.

**Making the cocktail**

Ingredients (Single Serving):
* 2 oz jasmine tea-infused floral gin
* 1 oz simple syrup
* 1 oz fresh squeezed lemon juice
* 4 dashes orange bitters
* ~5 oz Fever-Tree elderflower tonic (enough to top it off)
* Ice
* Garnish: Lemon peel slice

Instructions:
1. Fill a shaker with ice
2. Add gin, simple syrup, lemon juice, and bitters
3. Shake well
4. Strain into a Collins glass filled with ice
5. Top with elderflower tonic
6. Express a lemon peel over the drink, lighting the oils on fire. Drop it in as a garnish


I've gotta say, once I learned how to do the cool lemon peel oil fire thing, I feel like I could put anything in that glass and my friends would be impressed with it.

The best way I can describe this drink is that it tastes like a fizzy Arnold Palmer. The lemon juice with the simple syrup makes lemonade, plus iced gin tea. But I also feel like that over simplifies it because the orange bitters and elderflower in the tonic is also very apparent in the flavor.

I will say that if you make this, be careful with it, because what isn't apparent in the flavor is the alcohol. 1.3 shots of 46% liquor isn't a ton, but it might as well not be in there because you can't taste it. But hey, that's exactly what us college kids are looking for.

Anyway, like I said, I'm mostly trying to find out if I made something actually unique. I know tea infused gin isn't new but I can't find much info on cocktails made with it. 

Also, if anyone has constructive criticism for how to improve the recipe, I would absolutely appreciate it. Just because this thing tastes great, doesn't mean it can't taste better!

This crack in his trust, broke me! I felt unworthy, not enough and worse of all it made me very insecure about everything(this ontop of the already massive doubt from the postnatal depression), but seeing of our history, kids and his remorse i stayed and we tried again.

Me going fully in mom mode and trying to make sure the house is ready for our move etc the time flew by. With all the stress of the renovating and the horrible move(different story) the time flew by, but we settled in our new home!

In my mind everything is going bliss and yes there are struggles(intimacy and communication from him to me) but in which relationship are there no ups and downs(again old fashion; for better AND worse). He know s*x and trust are my biggest issues, I think intimacy is very important in your relationship(that's why I never gave myself to every best dude in my life) and trust because not everyone in my close family was trustworthy because they lied and cheated. so I learned very young that if someone has trust issues they are most likely not trustworthy theirselfs.

But now my problem;
*I'm still not over the camera incident
*he keeps making odd statements hinting at my trustworthiness(which i point out and he never means it that way)
*he asked while having s*x if I was even faithful to 1 c*ck(which again broke my corn  because of the vulnerable position I was in)
*I want/need him to show me an effort that he wants me and not just because I'm the mother of our children
*he says he is to occupied with his own battle against depression to fully give me an effort(while I'm very easy and more then willing to settle for bare minimum; coffee in bed for valentine or candles on with dinner)
But he says that he did alot of effort with those special days and it doesn't even do a difference apparently.

Not sure what to do to make this marriage work for the both of us. I just want him and our kids to be happy. 

At this point I'm just ranting and not even sure anymore what to say. if somethings not clear or needs more detail just ask

I just want an outsiders perspective to see what to do or to find tips/insides I didn't think about..

It was our first visit and we decided to stay on site at Bosrijk.

The hotel was comfortable and affordable, and only a short walk to the park. Unlike a lot of theme park hotels, our room had a separate walled off area for adults, so the kids had their own bunk beds and we didn't have to sit in the dark when they went to sleep considerably earlier than us.

The park is something else. It is world famous for its theming, and rightly so - but I wasn't expecting the ops to be so good. They were rattling through trains even on a cold damp February weekend, and all of the staff just radiated enthusiasm for the entire place. We didn't have a single bad experience.

I have seem some previous trip reports complain about a lack of English but a) we didn't really notice that and b) what do you even expect? We're in Holland! Most of the rides had either enough English within the narration to grasp what was going on, or translations on the walls or whatever. The only time I could have done with more info was on Villa Volta (a Vekoma Mad House) but there's every chance I just missed where the translations were or something.

As for the ride line up, coasters first:

Max and Moritz are two cute little duelling Mack powered family coasters with a couple of quasi-near misses. They weren't in any way forceful but still enjoyable. They complete two laps of the circuit and the second is faster, and so you get chucked around a little more. My kids are 7 and 9 and had outgrown this kind of coaster already, but they still enjoyed it. They compared it to Speedway Racers at Legoland Windsor and preferred Speedway. They also thought of stuff like Cat-o-pillar at Paultons which they said was ""more fun and with bigger drops"" even if it was technically aimed at a younger age group.

Vogel Rok was a really good dark coaster made by Vekoma with little internal theming but a very impressive entrance and queue. It has an in-car sound system with a good soundtrack and what feels like a proper triumphant ending. It was absolutely pitch black and impossible to ride defensively. I've seen some negative reviews online but I really enjoyed it.

Python is a relatively standard double looping steel coaster by Vekoma with what feels like the slowest lifthill I have ever experienced anywhere in the world. My 7 year old loved it as it only requires 1.2m (about 47"") height to ride so it was their first four-inverting coaster (the most they'd done previously was The Wave at Drayton, with three inversions). Because it was the only inverting coaster in the park they were big enough to go on, and because the queues were never more than about 5 minutes we did this 5 or 6 times a day. It didn't do much for me as it is such a simple layout and goes round it in a fairly pedestrian manner, but it's a big hit with the kids. No theming to speak of, and I REALLY love a decently themed ride.

My older kid was VERY excited to go on their first B&M Dive coaster, Baron 1898, as they are 1.39m tall, so 1cm too short to ride Oblivion near home, but Baron only requires 1.32m (52""). The pre-show and theming of this ride is absolutely brilliant. Really enjoyable. The ride itself was fun enough but, like Python, didn't really hit the heights for me. The hang didn't feel particularly thrilling and the loop  isn't forceful but I *loved* the Zero G roll and the Helix. It's a great dive coaster, and three times as long as Oblivion, but I preferred the Oblivion hang and drop.

Joris en de Draak is the absolute coaster highlight of the park. Two wooden duelling coasters from GCI. Both are great. There is insane whip and speeds in the back and the airtime at the front is fantastic. Just outstanding. Like the other coasters in the park except Baron, my younger kid was big enough to ride and had an amazing time. It was also my wife's favourite coaster in the park. Three of us preferred the Water side of the ride, one preferred the Fire side. It's a fantastic non-inverting wooden coaster that I wanted to ride many more times, but we only got one ride on each side per day as there was too much else to do, and queues were normally in the 15-20 min region.

Now for the non-coasters, which are just standout. Most people have heard of world class dark rides at Efteling like Symbolica, Droomvlucht (which almost feels like a coaster cred to me because of the ending) and Fata Morgana, but the whole line up is fantastic.

It's impossible to talk about the park, though, without focusing on the new indoor flatride, Danse Macabre. It's a 10/10 ride, and now easily my favourite flat ride in the world (NOT my favourite dark ride, which is still RotR). There are better ride mechanisms out there, and more forceful flatrides, but the combination of story, theming, design, sound, music, ride experience, everything. Insane. I loved every second of it. It understandably always had the longest queues in the park, at around 40 mins or so (although you could occasionally get moments of 15-20 mins before everyone else rushed there). We used our hotel early entry every day to have a quick ride on something else before getting into the Danse queue before the main park opened. We were on the first ride of the day each time, and it was always so, so special. I have thought about it a LOT since we got home.

Carnaval has some questionable theming at times by modern standards but the ride was charming, beautifully designed, and I loved the music. 

Other rides I loved, which aren't often mentioned, include the Pagoda (a flying island), which was a great way to relax for 10 mins, Sirocco (a Mack teacups ride) which lets you control the spin speed and we went CRAZY. Gondoletta was an incredible place to have lunch as we gently sailed around the park. The monorail was charm personified. The Steam Carousel near the classic ride section was the best of the old fair ground amusement rides, and well worth a stop.

I didn't think much of Villa Volta. It's easily the least impressive Madhouse I've done - even Monster Party at Legoland is more forceful and impressive. Haunted Manor at Drayton and Hex at Alton are both significantly better. Still, Madhouses are fun, so I didn't regret going.

Food and drink was very reasonably priced, and they have a very permissive attitude toward bringing your own food in, so feel free to bring a picnic.

And, amongst all of this, is the fairytale forest. A MASSIVE walkthrough area with dozens and dozens of stops and attractions to see and explore. It took us a full two hours to see everything, with a little coffee stop in the middle. A great way to relax in the early afternoon before heading back to rides. No other park I've been to has anything like it.

I have been to Disneyland (recently), Disney World (20 years ago), DLP, Universal Florida and CA, all of the UK parks, Bellewaerde, Fort Aventura, a few of the Six Flags parks in the States. For my tastes - someone who really LOVES theming, design, ops and infrastructure - I think it has become my favourite park. Universal and Disney certainly do the whole theming and design thing so well, but they have so much existing IP to build on. Efteling just hits differently in the charm stakes, and the ops are the second best I've seen anywhere in the world (after, bizarrely, Paultons Park in England which seems to just drill their staff like a batallion). This opinion may well change when we head to DW for 10 days in October - but I mustn't forget the value for money. Three days in the park, two nights in the hotel, two breakfasts, one dinner, tickets to the Caro show, flights from London, and a rental car, for four of us, came to only ¬£1,200 - ¬£300 each for all of that. Absolutely insane value for money. I just don't see how it could possibly ever be beaten for value for money, and the experience is quite, quite brilliant. If you're all about the coasters and thrills, it might not be for you, but if you love to lose yourself in a park, and let yourself fall in love with your surroundings, then Efteling is world class and unmissable.

I love your park, with all my heart. Incredible.

So we replaced it everything brand new.
A few days ago as I was watching tv the power cut off we didn‚Äôt have anything else running in the house and the power switch did not stay up so we went 14 hours without power in the front part of the house.

I took pics every hour to show timestamp for when I email real estate only lasted up till 11pm had to sleep for work. 
Woke up next morning at 6:30 and we were able to turn switch on.

In the midst of this chaos I was pissed we had to throw all our food away and all our meat in our deep freezer.

I wrote an email attached pics with timestamps and asked real estate for compensation to the owner for the loss of our food because we were told we needed new products hence the power trip but obviously not.

Now we are being told an electrician will come out in the morning to check if it is our appliances tripping the power and if so we will have to pay call out fee.

What I am furious about is that the last technician they sent over told us it was our appliances so we brought new appliances now they want to test our appliances saying it doesn‚Äôt matter if appliances are old or new it can still trip.

I‚Äôm no electrician but someone please tell me I‚Äôm not tripping (no pun intended) lol

There is a bigger issue with the electricity and the owner either doesn‚Äôt want to pay or electricians are just looking for a quick fix and fast pay.

A bit about myself, I come from an automotive / renewable energy engineering background with a lot of experience in large industrial systems integration and controls.  I know a bit about Linux, but by no means expert.  But I would say my core expertise is probably embedded systems integration.

 Anyways, the idea came about where I was helping my friend change the timing of his automated water facet in his bathroom.  It was quite a pain in the ass because we had to open it up, hook up a bunch of wires, figure out what signal needs to be sent, breadboard a bunch of transistors, hook up an arduino and run a bunch of different code etc.  eventually we figured it out needed an H-bridge of some sort pulsed at a  specific length and we eventually was able to figure out how to control it from an Arduino.

So that lead me to thinking of why not have have like EVERYTHING into a cyberdeck.  I'm talking a screen, keyboard where you can program code, as well as a built in oscilloscope, built in volt meter, and a bunch of open collectors, and h bridges, digital inputs, digital outputs that you can freely connect to anything and program it. 

This was something I've always wanted to do as well for my coffee roaster as it's super basic and I want to use more advanced control methods to control the fan and heater.  So really, you can hack all sorts of things with this cyberdeck.  ",1,1740646095.0,cyberDeck,1,1.0,False

However, with the arrival of children and the significant coffee consumption of my family, it can be time consuming to manually perform these tasks, especially when making multiple cups or in a hurry.

I was making espresso almost daily, struggling with getting the right grind, dose, yield, etc. Sometime last fall I switched to drinking tea.

In January, I decided to start making espresso again. I watched more videos and made a lot of changes to my brewing. I'm now able to get some decent shots (I always do a double) when I DON'T LOSE UP TO 10ml TO THE TABLE.

I don't know what is happening but rarely does the flow come from the center of the PF. It instead runs down the side where capillary action carries it to the stand and onto the table. I don't know if it's from using the crappy plastic tamper, which always leaves grounds on the side (last photo) and maybe creating channeling or something else. I honestly don't know why Flair didn't extend the bottom of the PF past the bottom of the brew head holder.

I currently use the black PF w/o the flow restrictor and the red PF w/o the flow restrictor & holder. So my question are, besides what is going on,
1) Will putting the flow restrictors back on affect my current process (16g dose, pre-infusion, ramp up, ramp down, stop at around 32ml)? In other words, will pressure as shown on the gauge change or extraction time change? 
2) Is anyone else having similar issues, ending up with coffee all over the stand & table?

Chapter 1: The Man in the Window

Carl adjusted his coat collar and peered through the blinds, just a sliver, just enough to see. The man across the street was standing at his window, staring directly at Carl‚Äôs apartment.

Carl froze. He was sure of it now. The man‚ÄîEmilio, as Carl had learned to call him in his head‚Äîhad been following him for days. Everywhere Carl went, Emilio was there. The laundromat, the coffee shop, even the grocery store. Not directly behind him, but always in his peripheral vision.

Carl wasn‚Äôt paranoid. He knew what he 

saw.

But what if it wasn‚Äôt real? What if he wasn‚Äôt real?

He backed away from the window and collapsed onto the couch, hands shaking. His mind swirled in a thick fog of questions. Was Emilio real? Was Carl real? Did any of this exist, or was it all just one very elaborate hallucination?

He scratched his head, then his chest, feeling his pulse quicken. Maybe he was imagining things. Maybe he was losing it. He hadn‚Äôt even been diagnosed with schizophrenia yet‚Äîhe wasn‚Äôt sure he wanted to be‚Äîbut something about this felt so wrong.

And then there was the staring.

The man across the street was staring again.

Carl‚Äôs eyes darted back to the window. This time, Emilio wasn‚Äôt just standing there. He was waving.

Carl stared at the gesture for a moment. What the hell is he doing?

He knew that kind of wave. The one that makes you want to crawl into a hole and disappear.

Carl turned away. He wasn‚Äôt going to engage. He wasn‚Äôt.




Chapter 2: The Coffee Shop

The next day, Carl walked into the coffee shop, trying to ignore the buzz of anxiety in his chest. He ordered a small black coffee‚Äînothing too fancy. Just something to keep his hands busy.

Carl settled into the corner, next to a window. He didn‚Äôt like sitting by the door; it made him feel exposed. The last thing he needed was for someone to see him, really see him. The way they might start whispering, or worse‚Äîask him what was wrong.

But then he saw him. Emilio.

The man sat three tables away, facing the window. He was looking at his phone, as if it was just a regular, boring Tuesday morning. But Carl knew better.

Emilio was watching him.


Carl‚Äôs heartbeat picked up. It had been weeks now. Weeks of seeing Emilio everywhere.

He sat still, staring at his coffee cup, fingers trembling. Was Emilio real? Was Carl real? Was any of this real?

Maybe Carl was imagining the entire scene. Maybe Emilio wasn‚Äôt even there. Maybe none of this had ever happened.

Carl tried to calm himself. He looked up again.

There was Emilio, staring right at him.

Carl blinked. No. It wasn‚Äôt possible. He hadn‚Äôt even moved yet. He hadn‚Äôt looked up from his coffee.

And yet‚Ä¶ there he was.

Carl‚Äôs mind started to race, a million possibilities flooding his thoughts. Could Emilio see him, too? Were they both part of the same delusion?

‚ÄúNot real,‚Äù Carl muttered under his breath. ‚ÄúNot real. Just‚Ä¶ a glitch in the system.‚Äù

Emilio raised an eyebrow.

Carl‚Äôs breath caught in his throat. He heard me.

Or did he?




Chapter 3: The Question of Realness

The day stretched on. Carl walked home, 

avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk, just in case stepping on one of them might break the world. He didn‚Äôt trust the ground anymore.

As he passed the alley near his apartment, Emilio appeared again, standing perfectly still under a flickering streetlight. His expression was unreadable.

Carl stopped, his eyes locked on the man. He didn‚Äôt know what to do. Should he say something? Would it matter? Did it even matter if they spoke? Could he speak to someone who might not exist?

Emilio stared back at Carl. His face was expressionless, but Carl could have sworn there was something off about the way Emilio stood. Like he wasn‚Äôt entirely there. Like he was waiting for Carl to make the first move.


‚ÄúI‚Äôm not following you,‚Äù Carl whispered, more to himself than to Emilio.

The words hung in the air, and for a moment, Carl wondered if he‚Äôd ever said them at all.

Then Emilio turned and walked away, disappearing into the shadows.

Carl stood there for a long time, staring at the empty space where Emilio had been.

Maybe he wasn‚Äôt real. Maybe Carl wasn‚Äôt.

Maybe nothing was real.



Chapter 4: The Reflection


Carl stared at his reflection in the window of his apartment. He wasn‚Äôt sure what he was looking for‚Äîperhaps some sign that he wasn‚Äôt completely falling apart. His image seemed distant, blurry. The kind of reflection you see in a dream when you‚Äôre unsure whether you‚Äôre awake.

He scratched his chin. The scruffy beard felt real. The stubble was the one thing he could always count on. At least I‚Äôm not imagining this, he thought.

But then, as he leaned closer, the reflection blinked.

Carl froze. The reflection blinked again. I didn't blink. Did I?

He stepped back, his heart pounding in his chest. He glanced at the hallway behind 

him. Empty.

I could be imagining this, he thought. Maybe I didn‚Äôt even see it.

But there it was again. The flicker of movement, subtle, just at the corner of his eye. His reflection grinned‚Äîlike it knew something he didn‚Äôt.

Carl slammed the window shut, and the reflection disappeared, leaving him staring at his own confused face. He shuddered.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not.‚Äù


Chapter 5: The Echo

It was late, and Carl sat on the edge of his 

bed, staring at the clock as if willing the minutes to pass. His thoughts were tangled, a mess of uncertainty. His mind kept circling back to Emilio, that damned man.

Where had he gone?

Carl hadn‚Äôt seen Emilio for days now. Not since the alley. He had checked the usual places: the coffee shop, the corner store, the park. Nothing.

The absence of Emilio was almost worse than his constant presence. At least when he was there, Carl could hold onto the belief that something was real. Even if that something was the most unnerving thing he could imagine.

The echo of Emilio‚Äôs face still lingered in Carl‚Äôs mind. He could picture the way Emilio‚Äôs mouth had barely moved when he 

spoke, how he‚Äôd seemed distant, just like Carl had felt his entire life.

Carl clutched his blanket, tugging it tight around his shoulders. His stomach was in knots. Maybe Emilio wasn‚Äôt real. Maybe Carl wasn‚Äôt, either.

But then the knock came.

At first, Carl thought it was the sound of his heartbeat, too loud and chaotic. But there it was again. A soft, hollow knock.

He stood, heart racing, and walked to the door.

Nothing.

Carl checked the peephole. No one was there.

A shiver ran down his spine.

Was it Emilio? Was it someone else? Was Carl imagining this whole thing?

A small voice in the back of his mind whispered, It‚Äôs just a sound. Nothing to worry about.

But Carl couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that someone‚Äîsomething‚Äîwas there.




Chapter 6: The Mirror

Carl didn‚Äôt know how long he had been staring at the bathroom mirror. He could see his own face, pale, gaunt. Tired eyes that had seen too much. He could hear the sound of his own breath, the soft, steady 

rhythm of it. But in the back of his mind, there was a nagging thought.

Was this me? Or was I someone else?

He blinked, then blinked again. The reflection didn‚Äôt move the way he did. It took a beat longer.

Carl‚Äôs heart slammed into his chest.

‚ÄúStop it,‚Äù he muttered to the reflection. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real. You‚Äôre not.‚Äù

But the reflection didn‚Äôt answer. It just grinned.

Carl stepped back, his head spinning. He wasn‚Äôt sure if he was still in his apartment or if he had somehow crossed into a different reality.

‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù he asked aloud.

The reflection didn‚Äôt respond.

But Carl could have sworn that for a second, it seemed to look at him with pity.


Chapter 7: The Game

Carl wandered the streets, trying to clear his mind. He hadn‚Äôt seen Emilio in a few days, but he couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that he was being watched. It was as if the entire world was holding its breath, waiting for him to crack.

He turned a corner and nearly bumped into a wall. But it wasn‚Äôt a wall.


It was Emilio.

‚ÄúAre you real?‚Äù Carl blurted out before he could stop himself.

Emilio‚Äôs eyes flickered, almost as if surprised by the question. He didn‚Äôt respond at first.

Then he smiled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm real. Aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Carl‚Äôs stomach dropped. What does that mean?

Emilio didn‚Äôt give him time to think. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs been following me.‚Äù

Carl swallowed hard. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù


‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs been trying to figure out if you‚Äôre real or not.‚Äù Emilio‚Äôs voice was almost playful now, like he was daring Carl to say something.

Carl felt a sharp pang in his chest. This can‚Äôt be real. This can‚Äôt be real.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm real. I‚Äôm real,‚Äù Carl repeated to himself, almost like a mantra.

But Emilio‚Äôs grin only grew wider.



Chapter 8: The Interruption

Carl sat at his kitchen table, staring at a half-eaten sandwich. The bread was dry, the lettuce wilted, but he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to care. The room felt... off. It was 

as if the space itself was holding its breath, waiting for something.

He looked at the clock. It was late, later than it should have been. But that didn‚Äôt make sense. He hadn‚Äôt been out for long. He hadn‚Äôt even finished his sandwich.

And yet... it was dark.

The knock came again. A soft, rhythmic tapping, like a drumbeat.

Carl froze. He wasn‚Äôt sure where it came from‚Äîinside the apartment, outside, or somewhere in his head.

‚ÄúKnock, knock,‚Äù came a voice.

Carl‚Äôs heart skipped a beat.

That voice. It was Emilio‚Äôs voice, but... 

different. Distorted. As if it had been stretched thin, like a rubber band pulled too tight.

‚ÄúKnock, knock,‚Äù the voice repeated.

Carl stood up, his legs shaky. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù

The silence that followed felt suffocating. Then, the voice spoke again, slow and deliberate.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs... you.‚Äù

Carl‚Äôs throat went dry. He couldn‚Äôt breathe. He couldn‚Äôt think. It was as if the world had warped into something he couldn‚Äôt understand.

The voice‚ÄîEmilio‚Äôs voice‚Äîwas gone, but the feeling of being watched lingered in 

the air, heavy and unrelenting.




Chapter 9: The Walk

Carl didn‚Äôt want to be in his apartment anymore. He couldn‚Äôt stand the silence, the way the walls felt like they were closing in. He grabbed his jacket and left, stepping out into the night. The cold air bit at his skin, but it felt better than the suffocating stillness inside.

He walked aimlessly, hands shoved deep into his pockets. The streets were empty, the world muted.

Except for one thing.

Emilio.


There he was, standing across the street, just like before. He wasn‚Äôt moving, just standing there in the dark, watching Carl with that same inscrutable expression.

Carl‚Äôs stomach flipped. He wanted to look away, to pretend Emilio wasn‚Äôt there. But he couldn‚Äôt. He couldn‚Äôt tear his eyes away, no matter how much he wanted to.

Emilio‚Äôs eyes flickered. Then, with a slow, deliberate movement, he raised his hand.

Carl‚Äôs breath caught. The wave. It was the same wave from before. That sickening, mocking wave.

But Carl didn‚Äôt wave back. He couldn‚Äôt.

Instead, he started walking faster, his footsteps echoing on the empty street. His 

heart was pounding in his chest, but he couldn‚Äôt stop. He couldn‚Äôt even make himself look back.

He turned a corner, and when he looked again, Emilio was gone.

But Carl wasn‚Äôt sure if he‚Äôd really been there at all.




Chapter 10: The Voice in the Dark

Carl had always thought he was good at keeping his distance. He‚Äôd spent most of his life in his own head, disconnected from the world. But now... now he couldn‚Äôt escape.

He lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, willing 

himself to fall asleep. But sleep wouldn‚Äôt come.

And then it came.

A voice, soft and distant at first, but growing louder.

‚ÄúCarl...‚Äù

He sat up, his heart racing.

‚ÄúCarl... it‚Äôs me.‚Äù

It was Emilio. Or maybe it wasn‚Äôt. Maybe it was someone else. Maybe it was his own voice, mocking him.

Carl pulled the covers over his head, trying to drown out the sound. But the voice wouldn‚Äôt stop.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real, are you?‚Äù the voice 

whispered, almost tenderly.

Carl‚Äôs hands shook. ‚ÄúI... I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he whispered back, his voice breaking.

The room was silent again.

But Carl couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was in the room with him. Something‚Äîsomeone‚Äîjust out of reach.

The voice returned, softer this time. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone.‚Äù

Carl felt his body go cold. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù he asked, his voice barely audible.

The voice paused. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm you. Or maybe you‚Äôre me.‚Äù

Carl‚Äôs mind spun. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to make sense of the words. 

But nothing made sense anymore.


Chapter 11: The Waiting Game

Carl was sitting in the park, trying to feel normal. The sun was out, the air was fresh‚Äîyet the unease gnawed at him like a persistent itch. He couldn‚Äôt stop checking the shadows, checking every corner.

He hadn‚Äôt seen Emilio in days. But somehow, it didn‚Äôt matter. The feeling of being followed, watched, it lingered.

He glanced over his shoulder. Nothing.

His mind was playing tricks on him. He had to remind himself of that.

He reached for his phone, hoping to distract himself, but when he looked at the screen, there was a message from an unknown number:

‚ÄúI see you. You can‚Äôt hide.‚Äù

Carl felt a chill run down his spine.

He quickly deleted the message, trying to calm himself. But then, the next message came.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt escape me.‚Äù

Carl stood up, his hands shaking. He scanned the park, searching for any sign of Emilio. But there was nothing. Nothing but the empty benches and the sway of the trees in the wind.

Who was it? Who was sending these 

messages?

His fingers trembled as he typed a response. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù

The reply came almost immediately.

‚ÄúYou know who I am.‚Äù

Carl‚Äôs heart stopped.


Chapter 12: The Reflection

Carl couldn‚Äôt stop looking at the mirror.

He had never really been one for self-reflection‚Äînot in the literal or metaphorical sense‚Äîbut now, the mirror 

had become a necessity. The only way to check if he was still there.

Was he?

He ran his fingers along his jawline, pressing against his skin to make sure it felt real. There was a faint ache, so he must still be corporeal. Still... him.

But that didn‚Äôt explain the feeling.

The voice had started again.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real,‚Äù it whispered from the other side of the glass.

Carl blinked, stepping back, his heart skipping. The reflection in the mirror hadn‚Äôt moved, but that didn‚Äôt stop the words from lingering.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just a figment. Just a joke. A joke 

that‚Äôs gone too far.‚Äù

Carl rubbed his eyes. He was exhausted. He needed to sleep.

But the reflection stared back at him.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt belong here,‚Äù it said again, and this time Carl couldn‚Äôt tell if the voice came from his head or the mirror.

Carl took a step forward, and his reflection leaned in too. A second too late. It wasn‚Äôt the same as before. It wasn‚Äôt just him looking back anymore.

A smile.

Not his smile.

Carl recoiled, his heart pounding. He slammed the bathroom door shut.



Chapter 13: The Message

Carl hadn‚Äôt left his apartment for days. He couldn‚Äôt. Not with the... presence that seemed to hang in the air, watching, waiting.

He didn‚Äôt answer his phone. Didn‚Äôt check his messages. He couldn‚Äôt risk it.

But of course, the moment he stopped looking was when it happened.

The doorbell rang.

It wasn‚Äôt unusual for people to visit, though it was unusual for people to actually ring the bell. Carl had given up on socializing 

years ago, so he couldn‚Äôt think of anyone who would come by unannounced.

Still, he found himself walking toward the door, heart thumping in his chest. Every step felt like it took longer than the last.

He reached the door and peeked through the peephole.

Nobody.

Nothing.

But then... the knock.

A heavy, deliberate knock, like a heartbeat in the silence.

Carl‚Äôs mind raced. He knew it was impossible. He had to have imagined it.

He slowly opened the door, half-expecting to see the empty hallway. But there it was, a small piece of paper wedged in the crack.

His fingers trembled as he took it, unfolding the note.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre watching me. But I‚Äôm watching you too.‚Äù

The words were scrawled in jagged handwriting, like the ink had been smeared.

He turned the paper over.

There was nothing. No return address. No explanation.

He stared at the note for a long time, trying to make sense of it. His fingers tightened around the edges, crumpling the paper as the voice returned.


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real,‚Äù it whispered again. ‚ÄúThis... is all a game. And you‚Äôre losing.‚Äù

Carl crumpled the paper and tossed it on the floor. He couldn‚Äôt keep doing this. He couldn‚Äôt keep chasing shadows.

But the shadows were always there. Always watching.


Chapter 14: The Search

The next morning, Carl decided he would finally go out. He would face this head-on. He would find Emilio. If Emilio was real.

Maybe if he saw him again, it would be real.

But it couldn‚Äôt just be any random search. No. This needed to be methodical.

Carl took a deep breath and stepped out of his apartment. The sunlight was sharp, almost too bright, but it felt like a relief. The world outside seemed normal. People walked by, chatting, laughing, completely oblivious. They didn‚Äôt know. They couldn‚Äôt know.

Carl kept walking. He turned corners, passed stores, crossed streets. Each step felt like a victory.

But then he saw something.

A shadow.

It was fleeting, almost too quick to catch, but Carl could swear he saw it.

A figure.


It wasn‚Äôt Emilio. It couldn‚Äôt be. Emilio was... different.

Carl sped up, heart racing, but the figure was gone before he could catch up.

He was losing it again.

But then, as Carl stood at the corner, looking at the empty street, something shifted.

There. At the end of the block.

A familiar face.

It wasn‚Äôt Emilio. It couldn‚Äôt be.

It was... someone else.

Carl felt his stomach drop as the figure 

turned to look at him. Their eyes locked.

And just as quickly as it had appeared, the figure vanished into the crowd.

Was it real?

Carl rubbed his eyes.

He had to keep moving.

He had to find out.


Chapter 15: The Real Question

Carl sat back in his apartment, exhaustion settling in. He stared at the walls, as if expecting them to change. The apartment had started to feel like a prison, like it was 

suffocating him.

Maybe this was it. Maybe this was all part of the joke‚Äîthe game he had lost.

Was he real? Was he just another hallucination, another part of the puzzle he would never solve?

He leaned back in his chair, his mind spinning.

And then, through the haze of confusion, he heard it.

That soft whisper.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real.‚Äù

Carl closed his eyes, clenching his fists.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs real then?‚Äù he shouted into the 

empty room, voice cracking with frustration.

The silence that followed was thick and suffocating. No answers.

Just... waiting.


Chapter 16: The Fragments

Carl woke up to the sound of his own laughter.

It wasn‚Äôt a pleasant sound. It wasn‚Äôt even a real laugh. It was more like the noise someone makes when they‚Äôve been trapped inside their own mind for far too long.

He wiped his face with his sleeve, trying to focus. The morning light was still there, spilling through the curtains. It looked like any normal morning. Nothing out of place.

But he knew better.

The fragments were already there, creeping around the edges of his vision. He could feel them like a chill down his spine. Little moments that didn‚Äôt make sense, scattered pieces of some larger picture he couldn‚Äôt quite put together.

He stood up, his legs shaky, and reached for the door. He needed to go out again. Maybe he‚Äôd find something that would make sense. Maybe Emilio would be out there.

Maybe he would stop laughing.

The door opened, and the hallway 

stretched before him, as if it had been waiting. He stepped into the quiet corridor, looking around to make sure it was empty.

And then he saw it.

A scrap of paper, taped to the wall.

Carl didn‚Äôt remember it being there before. He didn‚Äôt remember anyone putting it there.

The handwriting was familiar. Too familiar.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still watching.‚Äù

He froze.

Who wrote this? Who was watching him?

He turned the corner and stepped into the elevator. He needed to get outside. He needed to be normal for just one moment.


The elevator doors closed, but as the numbers above the door flickered, Carl felt a sharp pain in his chest. His heart was beating too fast, too erratically.

Too real.

The elevator stopped. Carl blinked.

He wasn‚Äôt on the first floor anymore.

He stepped out into an unfamiliar hallway. It was cold. Too cold. And the silence...

It was deafening.

Carl walked down the hallway, his footsteps echoing in the emptiness. Every turn seemed to stretch on, the walls closing in on him.

The doors were all the same. Blank, lifeless.

But then, there it was.

A door.

This door was different. The wood was cracked, the paint chipped. And it was... ajar.

He hesitated.

Was it the right thing to do? Was it... real?

He pushed the door open.

Inside was a room. It looked like his apartment. His real apartment. The one he had been hiding in all this time.

But the walls were covered in something.


Graffiti? No, it wasn‚Äôt graffiti.

It was words.

Words that had been written in desperation.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt belong here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre watching you.‚Äù

The phrases were scrawled all over the walls, the ceiling, the floor. As if someone had written them in a frenzy, trying to escape the same madness Carl had been battling.

He stepped back, heart racing.

But then the voice spoke again.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just one of us now. A part of the joke. Welcome to the end.‚Äù

Carl turned and ran.




Chapter 17: The Phone Call

Carl didn‚Äôt answer the phone.

He couldn‚Äôt.

The voice had been following him, always in the back of his mind, whispering doubts into his ears.

But this time...

It was different.

The phone rang again.

He looked at the screen.

It was a number he didn‚Äôt recognize.

‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù he muttered to himself, his fingers shaking as he hovered over the green button.

Something told him he shouldn‚Äôt pick up. Something told him he couldn‚Äôt.

But then...

His thumb pressed the button.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

There was silence on the other end. For a moment, Carl thought maybe the call had 

dropped.

Then came the voice.

Soft. Calm.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been looking for me, Carl.‚Äù

Carl‚Äôs breath caught in his throat. He knew that voice.

It was... it was Emilio.

But it wasn‚Äôt.

Not really.

‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôve been watching,‚Äù the voice continued, colder now. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been looking for answers. But you‚Äôre too far gone now. There‚Äôs nothing left but the game.‚Äù


The line went dead.

Carl stared at the phone, frozen.

Had he imagined that? Or had Emilio‚Äîor whatever it was‚Äîreally just called him?

Chapter 18: The Escape

Carl couldn‚Äôt take it anymore.

Every sound in the apartment felt like a warning. Every creak in the floorboards, every flicker of the lights, every whisper behind his back‚Äîhe couldn‚Äôt tell what was real.

It had to end.


He grabbed his coat and left.

This time, there was no plan. No destination. No hope of finding anything real. He just had to move.

The streets outside were busy, but everything seemed off. The people were moving too fast, too much like actors in some play he wasn‚Äôt part of.

He kept walking. The sound of his shoes on the pavement was the only thing that grounded him.

But the voices...

They were louder now.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real,‚Äù they hissed in unison. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never escape.‚Äù


Carl stumbled, his heart pounding. He grabbed at his chest, as if he could make it stop, as if he could fix whatever was broken inside him.

‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù he whispered to himself. ‚ÄúWho the hell am I?‚Äù

The voices quieted for a moment.

And then...

A figure.

Across the street.

A man, standing still, watching.

It was him.

Carl recognized his own face.


It wasn‚Äôt just a reflection.

It was the other version of him.

The one that had been watching, waiting.

They stared at each other. Neither one moving. Neither one speaking.

For a long moment, Carl wasn‚Äôt sure if he was standing still... or if the world around him had just stopped.

Then, the figure turned and walked away.

Carl followed.

1izb61d,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1izb61d/my_solo_female_bkk_trip_notes/,My solo female BKK trip notes,"I spent 4 nights in BKK and used this sub a lot to help me plan! This was my first solo trip and first time in BKK. Not a big party animal. Thanks for all the tips reddit! 

Accom - stayed in a 4 bed female only room at Jam Hostel. Social and clean. A simple breakfast of fruit/eggs/cereal/toast was  included between 8-11 am. Only issue was a drunk European (I think?) lady trying to bash down the door one day at 4 am (looking for the lift) but I rang management and they sorted it. 

Sights - worth the fees and worth getting up early to beat crowds. I did the Grand Palace (500 baht), Wat Pho (300 baht I think?) and Jim Thompson (200 baht) house and enjoyed those. Went to the BKK Arts and Culture centre which was free, fine and easy to add on from MBK. Lumpini park was cool for a break and close to the MRT. 

Shopping centres with food halls - CentralWorld (my fave!), Siam Paragon (so fancy) and Old Siam Plaza (small but delicious).

Transport - taxis (with the meter on), Grab App,  MRT (tapped my Visa card) or good old walking. Hostel organised a shuttle to the airport for 200 baht. Big malls have a dedicated Grab pick up zone which was handy. 

Money - I used Superrich outlets to change cash. Didn‚Äôt use my visa apart from MRT/Grab.

Food - I washed my hands a lot and only ate on the street if I could see it being made (meat refrigerated, clean area etc). Otherwise I stuck to the food malls and restaurants. 

Cafes - Sense, play space. I ordered anything with yuzu! Didn‚Äôt have a bad coffee anywhere honestly. 

Massages - Baan 21 but anywhere well lit where staff wear uniforms seemed fine. 

Safety - I felt very safe during the day and OK walking around alone at night. Anyone who talks to you first on the street wants your money. I avoided tuk tuks and anyone talking about the Big Buddha (a scam). I wore a bumbag/cross body bag and kept it close. 

Air quality - good as it had just rained. I had a P2 mask with me that I only wore on my first day in BKK before the rain came and washed the air clean. 

My golden tip would be carrying some toilet paper in a sealed zip lock bag so that you don‚Äôt get caught without it. There was no toilet paper at some bathrooms at certain temples and public places. 

Enjoy and happy planning!

Since I watched some videos on YT and overheard a friend of mine calling really shitty coffee good, I decided to get into it and buy my first equipement, which would be the DeLonghi Dedica EC 685 Espresso machine and the Mahlk√∂nig/Baratza Vario Grinder (please see the photos attached). Since the basket was not good, I also bought a new one. After learning the basics (which would be extraction time and so on...) I found out, that:

First, it seems no matter what I do, the extraction time is always around 13 seconds, which seems kinda short? (The brewing time still didn't change even after changing the grinding size dramatically)

Second, even though a single shot is considered to be 8-10g of coffee, I need around the double just to get any kind of consistency and aroma, so am I misunderstanding something about the amount of coffee needed?

Further, the Puck is most of the time very wet, though I am sure I temper just about right...

1izaxao,https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/1izaxao/trapper_buff_idea/,Trapper Buff Idea,"If a survivor steps into one of his traps, no matter what health state they are in, they will become downed, and the trapper will see their aura for a few seconds. Survivors can see auras of traps near hooked survivors. Trapper can pick up a trap from far away every so often, but not while in chase, and he still has to place them down like he usually does. The manual (direct trapper interaction) trap setting sound is silent, so if trapper is indirectly resetting a trap, the trap will still do the usual sound effect. If a survivor is caught in a trap, the survivor will have to take a guaranteed amount of time (10 seconds) before getting out of it by themselves. If another survivor is there to help them, it will take 5 seconds to get them out, and the trapped survivor will have still taken a health state no matter what (that means from injured to dying if they were caught injured). However, the survive who healed them may get a small boost in healing that specific survivor for a few seconds (40% faster for 10 seconds). If a survivor helps, the helper will also have their aura revealed. If a survivor is already downed from a bear trap, and is still in the dying state, when another survivor steps into a bear trap, they will take half the time to get out of the trap, and may become injured (or in deep wound if was already injured), but will not be downed. There are two separate abilities: resetting traps from afar, and picking traps up from afar. Picking up a trap from afar will be a 20 second cooldown. Resetting a bear trap from afar will also have a 20 second cooldown. The trapper cannot pick up a bear trap from afar in chase. Trapper no longer has a maximum carry capacity. Survivors take 10 seconds to disarm a trap. Traps have a 2 meter low noise that plays constantly. 

Addons: 

Iridescent 2:

Father-Son Picture: A picture of his father standing blankly behind him. You set traps 25% faster. After setting down a trap, all windows are blocked within 16 meters of you, and you move at 4.4 meters for 20 seconds.

1izawov,https://www.reddit.com/r/scottishish/comments/1izawov/the_trimming_crew/,The trimming crew,"The Trimming Crew

The air in the trimming room was thick. Heavy.

Sweet with the scent of fresh-cut buds.

MAC 1.

The smell clung to their clothes. Their skin. The backs of their throats.

Rich. Creamy. Like vanilla butter. But sharp. Diesel fumes and citrus. A bite that stung the sinuses.

And underneath it‚Ä¶ something else.

Something damp. Earthy. Wrong.

It wasn‚Äôt just a smell.

It wrapped around them. Seeped into their lungs. Sat too thick on the tongue.

And beneath the buttery vanilla, beneath the citrus and spice, there was something rotting.

Something watching.

The crew worked in silence.

Scissors snipping. Snicking. Wet sounds that echoed too long.

They had been here for a week.

A week.

Trimming for a grower who paid double their usual rate.

Now they understood why.

They had worked together for years.

Greg, the manager. Always talking to the growers. Always making deals. Lately though, his meetings had been getting longer. He‚Äôd come back different each time ‚Äì clothes pristine but skin waxy, movements jerky like a puppet on strings.

Tom, the joker. The one who kept things light.

Lisa and Sarah, best friends. Always together.

Mark, the quiet one. Not much to say, but always watching.

And Eric.

Eric knew things.

Eric had only been with them for a few months, but he knew everything.

The best way to trim. The science behind the strains. How to tell if a plant was off.

‚ÄúSee this bend?‚Äù he‚Äôd say, adjusting Lisa‚Äôs scissors. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a sign the plant wasn‚Äôt flushed properly. The grower must‚Äôve cut corners.‚Äù

When Greg started missing meetings, showing up hours late with no memory of where he‚Äôd been, it was Eric who covered for him.

‚ÄúProbably just stressed,‚Äù he‚Äôd say when Sarah asked about the strange noises coming from Greg‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúThis job gets to everyone eventually.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou guys worry too much,‚Äù he‚Äôd say ‚Äúthis is a building full of weed it should be a happy place‚Äù when Sarah whispered about shadows moving in the corners.

‚ÄúOld buildings make weird noises.‚Äù

And they believed him.

Because why wouldn‚Äôt they?

But things weren‚Äôt right.

Sarah noticed the buds twitched. Not from static. Not from moisture. They‚Ä¶ moved.

Mark found symbols carved into stems. Tiny screaming faces when held up to the light.

Tom stopped joking after cutting himself. The cut refused to heal.

Greg stopped eating during breaks. Just sat there, staring at nothing, his skin stretching and contracting like something was moving underneath. When he did speak, his words came out wrong ‚Äì consonants twisted, vowels drawn out too long. Sometimes his jaw would work silently, as if practicing unfamiliar movements.


No one wanted to be the first to say it.

But they all knew.

Something was wrong with the building.

It was watching them.

Listening.

Tom was the first to break.

They were in the break room, a small, windowless space with a fridge, a coffee maker, and a table covered in snack wrappers.

No one had been hungry lately.

Then Lisa saw something inside the coffee machine.

It wasn‚Äôt mold.



It was pulsing.



‚ÄúGuys‚Ä¶ what the hell is that?‚Äù



Eric inspected it. Calm. Too calm.



‚ÄúFungal contamination, probably,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen this before. No big deal. Just don‚Äôt touch it.‚Äù



His certainty soothed them.



Even when Greg‚Äôs skin began to ripple beneath his clothes.



Even when Sarah swore she heard the walls breathing.


Tom stirred his coffee. Slowly. Staring at it.

The others were quiet, waiting for him to speak.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy,‚Äù Tom said finally.

The coffee in his cup moved.

Not sloshing. Rising.

Dripping upward.

The black liquid stretched toward the ceiling in a thin, trembling thread.

Tom dropped the cup. It shattered on the table, spilling coffee that never hit the floor.

The liquid crawled up the walls instead.

Mark shoved his chair back. ‚ÄúJesus Christ!‚Äù he screamed.

Lisa covered her mouth. Sarah grabbed her wrist.

Eric, sitting across from Tom, didn‚Äôt flinch.

He sighed.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all just exhausted,‚Äù he said. Patient. Calm. ‚ÄúTrimming this much, for this long? It messes with your head.‚Äù

He leaned forward. Smiled.

‚ÄúDrink some water homie. You‚Äôll feel better.‚Äù

Tom stared at him.

At his smile.

And for the first time‚Ä¶

Tom didn‚Äôt trust him.

Greg wasn‚Äôt in the break room. Hadn‚Äôt been seen since morning, when he‚Äôd locked himself in his office. Strange sounds had been filtering through the door ‚Äì wet, squelching noises and a low, constant hum that made their teeth ache.

They should have checked on him.

Should have noticed sooner when the sounds stopped.

But they went back to work instead. Trying to pretend everything was normal. Trying not to think about what was happening to their manager, their friend.

Then it happened.

Sarah‚Äôs scissors hit something solid inside a bud.

SNAP.

Clear fluid sprayed across her face.

It burned like acid. Her skin instantly blistering beneath the liquid. 

She screamed.

The bud split open.

And something inside it‚Ä¶ blinked.

The crew crowded around.

Staring.

Not breathing.

The bud was full of eyes.

Human eyes.

Familiar eyes.

‚ÄúThose are‚Ä¶‚Äù Eric‚Äôs voice was steady. 

Lisa‚Äôs stomach lurched. ‚ÄúJanet.‚Äù

She knew those green eyes.

Janet had taken a trimming job here six months ago.

She hadn‚Äôt heard from her since.

And now‚Ä¶ she was here.

They weren‚Äôt trimming marijuana.

They were harvesting something else.

A figure stepped from the shadows.

It wasn‚Äôt hiding anymore.

It was wrong.

A twisted mass of stems and leaves and human parts, grafted together into something unnatural.

It jerked forward in impossible angles.

Leaving behind a trail of spores.

Spores that whispered their names.

Lisa 

Sarah 

Tom 

And Greg Stumbled into the room ‚Ä¶

Greg was no longer Greg.

His skin split open like overripe fruit.

And inside‚Ä¶

Tendrils.

Tendrils that had been wearing Greg like a suit.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need to leave,‚Äù Greg said.

But it wasn‚Äôt just his voice.

It was many voices, many tones and accents.

Speaking from mouths that opened across his body. 

‚ÄúWe belong here now.‚Äù

The crew screamed.

The walls closed in.

The lights went out.

And in the darkness‚Ä¶

They finally saw the truth.

The facility was alive.

It was one massive organism.

And they were being digested.

Their screams became part of the whispers.

But one figure did not scream.

His movements were too smooth.

Too calm.

His uniform, now clearly visible, bore a logo none of them had noticed before:

‚ÄúLovely Ladies Who Trim.‚Äù

He stepped away from the writhing mass.

He pulled out his phone. Calmly. Casually.

He typed.

‚ÄúGot another crew for you.‚Äù

He smiled.

A warm smile.

A friendly smile.

‚ÄúThe Ladies are eager to start. Same rate as usual?‚Äù

Behind him, the thing that had been his crewmates pulsed and whispered.

Eric had played his part perfectly.

As he had so many times before.

Because after all someone had to, feed, the garden.
