One day at a club the fmc hooks up with the mmc and after that night she can‚Äôt seem to remember the guy. All she remembers is that he had a tattoo of a windmill.

1hym13c,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hym13c/men_how_to_get_a_date_in_2025/,Men: How to get a date in 2025,"I've seen a lot of posts here and elsewhere by guys who have trouble getting a date. Usually the reasons are not very complex‚Äîit usually boils down to a few fundamental issues. I've tried to distill it to five action points; if you follow these diligently and apply yourself, I can almost guarantee that you will get a date in 2025.

1. Learn how to approach women. This is not negotiable, so better start practicing right away. Set a goal to interact with at least five women you don't know, every day. It's OK to start small‚Äîif you're socially awkward, making small talk with a cashier counts. Once you're comfortable with that, move on to initiating conversations with strangers. After that, start asking for their contact details so you can get a date. The goal is to keep pushing the boundaries of your comfort zone, so you have to keep challenging yourself. If you're struggling to make conversation, ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" is a great book about how to talk to anyone‚Äînot just women.
2. Get your life in order. Take inventory of your life: What things are you not satisfied with, other than not having a girlfriend? Are you living a life that a woman would want to be a part of? Make a list of things in your life you would like to improve‚Äîsocial life, career, fitness, finance, how you dress, etc.‚Äîand then start aggressively pursuing these goals. Jordan Peterson's ""12 Rules for Life"" is a good starting point.
3. Hit the gym! For guys, strength training is an easy win‚Äîit improves your physique, gives you more confidence and is a natural way to increase testosterone (which makes you less risk averse). Aim for at least three 30-60 minute sessions a week if you want to see results. ""Starting Strength"" is a good primer for weightlifting, so start with that and move on to more advanced programs when you're ready. If you're too broke for the gym, or don't have one nearby, body weight resistance training works as well‚Äîa pull-up bar is like $50, so money is no excuse.
4. Go to places where women hang out. You can meet women at the gym, coffee shops, bookstores, special interest groups, etc... Classes are another great way to meet women, as you meet up with the same group of people multiple times. However, don't go to classes and activities¬†*only*¬†to meet women‚Äîmake sure you're interested in the class as well. (E.g. don't be that weird guy who's always at the back of the yoga class)
5. Practice positivity. It's really easy to get stuck in a negative mindset if you're struggling with some aspect of your life. However, keep in mind that negative, self-deprecating thoughts are no more rational than positive thoughts, so you may just as well think positively. Try the following: Any time you have a negative thought like ""I'm never going to get a date"", try thinking an opposite, positive thought instead, like ""I will get a date if I apply myself"". Try to visualize the positive thought coming to life‚Äîyou're on a date with a pretty girl and you're both having a great time. Try to make these ""daydreams"" as immersive as possible; make yourself feel excited about where you're going, rather than depressed about where you are. Do these visualization exercises as often as you can, but at the very least the first thing when you wake up in the morning and the last time you do before you fall asleep. Read ""The Secret"" for more about manifesting the life you want‚Äîit's all pseudoscience, but I do believe the principles work (but not for the reasons claimed in the book). Plus, women love The Secret, so it might give you something extra to talk about!

It's not complicated, but that doesn't mean it's easy‚Äîbut I promise it's going to be worth it. 

Finally, remember to treat people with respect. Don't give people false ideas about your intentions, don't cheat  and don't lie. 

If you think this was good advice, please share it! Let's make 2025 the year where we make those birthrates go up!

So you can either get a hotel, or pull an all nighter and find something to do. Obviously you can go to music clubs and bars, but what are some other things to do? Here are some of mine

Round1.
https://www.round1.co.jp
Probably the biggest arcade you have ever seen with arcade games, pool/billiards, bowling, indoor sports, karaoke and more. You can buy basic alcoholic drinks and food as well. Easy way to spend an all nighter

Karaoke.
You can go to the big ones all around Tokyo, in which you will typically get a room for your group. This is especially good if you're out with a group of Japanese people, makes it more fun. If you're out with your gaijin friends and not necessarily good singers, then I recommend something a bit different.
At himawari studio, you can sing along with two musicians who will play your song. The place is pretty small, and can get very packed at times. It's essentially one room full of people taking turns to sing.
https://himawaristudio.owst.jp/
Open mic at Ruby. A good place to meet people. I think it's only in Tuesdays though?
https://rubyroomtokyo.com/open-mic/
I'm sure there are more but these are the only ones I have been to. Any one have other suggestions? 

Snack bar.
These are the typical salary man hang out in Japan. For most, you need to speak Japanese to attend and should go with a Japanese person. At a snack bar, mama-san will serve you drinks, food and hang out with you and the other guests. Usually a mama-san is the owner in their 50s or older. Many snack bars also include karaoke. Most that I have been to are outside Tokyo in other prefectures. Does anyone have recommendations for good ones in Tokyo?

24 hour onsen.
Most onsen are outside of Tokyo but you can find bathhouses that use onsen waters or just regular bathhouses. If you're on the outskirts of Tokyo, you can generally get pretty cheap entry of about 1000 yen. This includes soft drink or tea and coffee. At Tokyo dome you can find laqua, which operates 24 hours but becomes more pricey at later hours.q


Net cafe.
A good way to spend the night especially if you're alone. They are open 24/7 and can be cheaper than getting a hotel. Many have a variety of choice on the facility, e.g small cubical, booth (some for more than one person) or even room. Internet cafes obviously provide internet, but they also provide a lot more, like access to games, manga, showers, food and drink etc. You can find internet cafes all around Tokyo, usually with a sign saying "" internet"" or ""internet cafe"" in English

Late night cinema.
Many big cinema companies have a late session in Tokyo. Last late session is usually around 2am.

Oppabu (oppai-pubu).
Yes breasts bars. If you're into this sort of thing, then pretty good prices for all you can drink and touching breasts. Expensive for more than 1 or 2 hours though. I posted about pink tiger in Ueno in a seperate post

1hylx30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hylx30/i_watch_the_coyote_it_watches_me/,I watch the coyote. It watches me.,"My name is Melanie. I‚Äôm twenty three years old and I‚Äôm clinically depressed. Not pulling for sympathy here or anything, just stating a fact. I couldn‚Äôt tell you when it started and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll ever end. I‚Äôve mourned a lot in my twenty three years and I‚Äôd like to think it shaped me into the shell of a human I am today. My daily functions are toggled like that of a sim‚Äôs. Going through the motions and doing only the things I know are essential to my survival, though, I‚Äôm not really sure what my purpose here is. They say grief gets better with time. That one day, it won‚Äôt hurt as much. That‚Äôs bullshit. The feelings of grief come and go like waves lapping the shore. It begs the question, if it always comes back does it ever really leave? 

I‚Äôd been to two funerals before age twelve. Both distant relatives that I hadn‚Äôt seen since I was a toddler. Their passing, specifically, didn‚Äôt thwart me much. However, the process of a funeral, an open casket, my little feet padding closer to a dead body, it was as if my consciousness began there. Where some saw a celebration of a life well lived, I saw the black and unforgiving maw of death through the eyes of a child. 

It‚Äôs safe to say I wasn‚Äôt the same. Anxiety taunted me at night and I spent four years sleeping on the floor in my parent‚Äôs bedroom. My mom was my comfort and my dad was my protector. As long as they were by my side, I‚Äôd be okay. 

‚ÄúShelia is getting a horse?!‚Äù My ten year old self exclaimed. I‚Äôd been lost in the rain droplets on the car window, choosing a particularly supple drop with my index finger. I traced it as it raced down the window towards the finish line, worthy opponents on all sides. But my focus on my champion was snapped by my parents speaking in hushed tones. I heard Shelia, my mom‚Äôs friend. And I heard horse. 

‚ÄúNo, Mel, not a horse.‚Äù My dad replied in tangent, earning a look from my mother I‚Äôd only seen before I was scolded. My parents locked eyes at the red light, seeming to have some sort of telepathic conversation with their eyes. They did that a lot. My mom sighed then, pinching the bridge of her nose. ‚ÄúShelia is getting a divorce.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a divorce?‚Äù I asked. I‚Äôd never heard the word before. I was an only child at the time with two doting parents so, can you blame me?

‚ÄúA divorce is when a husband and a wife, well, stop being husband and wife. They break up, essentially, and go their separate ways.‚Äù My mom explained, her words ringing in my ears as panic increased in my naive heart.  

‚ÄúYou and dad won‚Äôt get a divorce right?‚Äù I asked, the words spilling frantically from me. It never occurred to me that this was something plausible. Shelia‚Äôs daughter, my friend Megan, must‚Äôve been going through the worst of times. 

‚ÄúSweetheart no, your mother and I are very much in love. It‚Äôs true love, in fact. You know nothing can stop true love.‚Äù My dad reassured me and my mom smiled. I was at ease. My dad was the king, my mom the queen, and I their one and only princess. My life was perfect. Divorce wouldn‚Äôt tear my family apart and with them by my side, I‚Äôd be okay. 

How stupid of me. Two years later I‚Äôm seated on the couch with my mom, our dog curled up in between us. My dad, seated on the loveseat in front of me, is offering up platitudes and reassurances. I hear what he‚Äôs saying and it registers in my mind‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs like watching the news during a tragedy. The reporters spill information out and the tv drones on but you become awash in some dreadful emotion that tugs you down like a swift current. You can drown while sitting perfectly still in your own home. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll still be there for your cross country meets and band concerts.‚Äù 

It hadn‚Äôt even been a full twenty four hours since my mom found out, and my dad was already slipping from me the way the sun dips behind the clouds. I wanted to shout at him, scream at him, curse his name, and maybe even slap him. But I simply said, ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù while glancing down at my hands, my torn up nail beds. 

I‚Äôll spare you the gory details as much as possible, but it‚Äôs bleak. My dad had cheated on my mom with my children‚Äôs minister at church. A kind woman I‚Äôd come to trust over the years, as I‚Äôd frequented that church since I was a baby. The coming months were messy. My dad found new living arrangements. I tried to put on an excited face for him and his new house but all I felt was dread. Then, a few weeks later, the big one happened. What could be worse than adultery, impending divorce, and separating households you might ask? A pregnancy. My forty two year old mom was unexpectedly pregnant. The pregnancy itself was nothing short of miraculous. My mom shouldn‚Äôt have been able to have anymore children. She‚Äôd had some procedures, emergency cyst removal, and was down a whole fallopian tube. So somehow, in the midst of our shared anguish, my mom and I had to navigate uncharted territory entirely. 

Little did I know, at the time, my baby sister would be our salvation. She arrived early, like I had, entering this world with a round head, a button nose, and a shock of strawberry blonde hair. She breathed life back into me and my mom. Our days were busier and there wasn‚Äôt time to focus on the bleak, melancholy of it all. At thirteen, I held my infant sister in my arms, teary-eyed with my cousins at my side. At twenty three, I‚Äôm watching her run towards me off the school bus. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in pajamas again.‚Äù She says, sidestepping me to reach for the doorknob. 

‚ÄúAstute.‚Äù I reply and follow her into the house. Our routine hardly changes. I wake up around noon, wait for her to come home, she gets a snack and goes to read or watch tv, and I just‚Ä¶exist. Sometimes, I‚Äôll remember to eat. Sometimes I‚Äôll listen to a podcast while doing laundry, creepy stories droning through my headphones, sometimes I‚Äôll draw. Or, most days, I crawl back into bed and lie still until my mom gets home. When she does, we‚Äôll talk for roughly twenty minutes and I‚Äôll revert back to my room and glide under the covers once more. Like I said, you can drown while staying perfectly still in your own home. I‚Äôve lost a lot that I will never get back. My grandparents on my mom‚Äôs side, to old age. My grandpa on my dad‚Äôs, to cancer. My cousin, to suicide. My baby, to miscarriage. My dad, to another family. 

When you don‚Äôt see someone for a while, you start to forget their face. In my mind, it‚Äôs like in anime, where an unimportant character you won‚Äôt see again is talking and the top half of their face is blackened out, the animators not even bothering to draw any detail above the mouth. You‚Äôll forget smile lines, forehead wrinkles, tattoos, things like that. If enough time passes, even their voice is lost on you. 

The house is dark now. I stand in the kitchen absentmindedly filling my cup with ice, then water. It‚Äôs snowing, in Tennessee, our one snowfall of the year. It collects and piles on the grass outside and if I stand close enough to the glass back door, I‚Äôll feel the cold air on the other side of it. The house is quiet and empty. My mother and sister are on a trip with my sister‚Äôs cheer squad. I stayed behind, I don‚Äôt do well on trips anymore. 

When you float through life aimlessly you aren‚Äôt as privy to things. My focus is never wholly on anything in particular, and what a more alert person might pick up on, drifts past me like a winter wind. 

My corgi is on high alert, snapping me out of a daze. Her ears flatten against her head, her little body standing at attention by the back door. A low growl emanates from her. 

‚ÄúDude, hush.‚Äù I tell her. She‚Äôd bark at a leaf if the wind stirred it. Another low growl escapes her and she stands stock still. I sit down on the couch with a sigh, drape my blanket over my legs, pick up my ipad and stylus and resume my drawing. I begin to shade my sketch, losing myself in the process and droning out all other thought but my art. After a while, I glance at the stove clock, half an hour has passed. And my corgi is still standing at attention by the back door. ‚ÄúCome here Winnie.‚Äù I call to her, patting the couch. Usually, that sequence incites a rush of paws and fur into my lap and an excited pup in my arms. Not now, not this time. Her pointed ears flatten again and she whines, not a growl, but a whimper. The dim lamp light beside me flickers and the bulb hums and buzzes before the light it gives off dies out entirely. I move from the couch and scoop Winnie up in my arms, glancing over my shoulder to the yard beyond the glass. I live in a sprawling neighborhood, with homes so close together you could throw a rock and hit at least a few in one go. My neighbors all conveniently have fenced in yards, with six foot gaps in between them on all sides. We could afford our house, not the fencing. Animals traipse to and fro in our yard often. My large neighborhood is bordered by thick, dense woods. It‚Äôs not uncommon for me to spy a rabbit or two during the spring, or a doe and her fawn on the outskirts of the running trail in front of the neighborhood. So when I see an animalistic silhouette, I‚Äôm not alarmed. 

‚ÄúGeez dude, it‚Äôs just a-‚Äú I flick on the backyard light. It only casts a little light into the space, illuminating sparkling snow and Winnie‚Äôs paw prints. The light falls just short of whatever is out there but it‚Äôs unmistakable to me now. Glowing eyes peer into the glass door set above a hewn snout. Dark lines of the animal‚Äôs slender silhouette reveal perked up ears, gangly body, and a puffy tail. A coyote, not uncommon for these parts, I‚Äôm just grateful I hadn‚Äôt decided to let Winnie out for a bathroom break. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a coyote.‚Äù I tell her as she wriggles in my arms. ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt hurt you in here.‚Äù I tell her again, opting to take her upstairs to my room, lest the coyote provoke her malice once more. 

After an hour, Winnie tires herself out in my bed, splayed out with her back legs in the air, sound asleep. By this point, it‚Äôs around eleven pm and I‚Äôm far from tired. I make my way downstairs and fiddle with the lamp. The bulb isn‚Äôt just burnt out, I realize, it‚Äôs completely blackened from top to bottom. I head to fetch a replacement from the bin in our garage, passing the kitchen and the glass door to my backyard as I go. I stiffen, sort of halted in that middle space of my home. I turn my head, that deep innate fear that I‚Äôm being watched isn‚Äôt easily ignored. A dark blanket of unease falls over me like a billow of snow that glides off the roof when it begins to melt. I cast my gaze through the glass door and see the coyote, its position unchanged, save for the fact that it was now seated on its haunches and staring directly into my home. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù 

I should preface, I am google‚Äôs strongest soldier. After retrieving a new bulb from the garage, and locking eyes with the ever present coyote as I pass through the kitchen, I tap away at the keys and in a moment I‚Äôm presented with a more logical explanation. Coyotes are opportunistic hunters that often prey on small animals, including small house pets. Winnie had seen the coyote and it had seen her. Surely, with the snow we‚Äôve had for a solid week, prey is scarce. You won‚Äôt get my dog, fucker. 

I fall back into my comfortable pattern of drawing until my fingers go numb-thanks carpel tunnel syndrome-long into the night. Around two am, I call it, my eyes growing weary and exhausted. My phone buzzes on the coffee table. I answer.

‚ÄúHey Mel.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAndre. Hi, how‚Äôs work?‚Äù My voice wavers slightly. That unease I felt before, I couldn‚Äôt shake, even now. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong Mel? You sound sad.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sad I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶scared I guess.‚Äù I answer, biting away at my cuticles, phone pressed to my ear propped up by my shoulder. ‚ÄúHold on, let me put you on speaker.‚Äù I tell him. 

‚ÄúWhy are you scared, love?‚Äù His voice reassures me. Just his comforting tone alone is enough to make me shake off the anxiety. 

‚ÄúI saw this coyote in the backyard. Well, Winnie saw it first.‚Äù I divulge. 

‚ÄúDid she give it hell?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou know she did. She didn‚Äôt scare it off, though. Her sausage body isn‚Äôt very intimidating.‚Äù I say, chuckling. I feel like I can breathe easier. ‚ÄúJust, being home alone for the weekend has me a little spooked, I guess.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù Andre reassures me. ‚ÄúAnd right when I clock out I‚Äôll drive over and stay with you so you won‚Äôt be alone okay?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm off at 4.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI hate that they have you on graveyard shift now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know babe, but I need the money. I gotta go now or my boss will be on my ass. Just hang tight okay? Only a few more hours. I love you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù The line beeps and I set down my phone, wrapped in Andre‚Äôs hoodie, my restless mind at bay. 

The coyote is closer. 

I don‚Äôt know when it moved but it did. It‚Äôs only a few paces from the concrete slab outside the glass door, staring at me with wide, wet eyes, orange beady pearls that seem to slice through my gut. I‚Äôd only stepped into the kitchen to flick the house lights off‚Ä¶

I blink and it‚Äôs closer, right up against the glass. Its breath fogs up the window. For a moment, it does nothing, just silently huffs misty exhales. I watch the coyote, it watches me. I stare in abject horror as it leans its head back then bangs its forehead against the glass. Then again. And again. And again. The glass door now bloodied, I dart upstairs, slamming my room door shut behind me and sliding down the wood. My chest heaves, my paled skin breaking out in a cold sweat. What the fuck was that? My heart hammers in my chest with a ferocity so intense, it threatens to leap out. 

‚ÄúMelly? Can I sleep in your room?‚Äù A voice softly begs behind my door. Lyla? It can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶she‚Äôs in Gatlinburg. I glance down at the hallway light leaking through the gap in between the door and the carpet. Sure enough, I see Lyla‚Äôs feet there, her penguin pajama pants at her ankles. I don‚Äôt have time to question it. There are times I could‚Äôve been kinder to her, despite the fog in my head. I should say yes to sister sleepovers more often. I shouldn‚Äôt sleep the day away after she gets home from school. I should play with her in the snow more. She‚Äôs had nightmares before, calling out my name, screaming for me or my mom to help her. I don‚Äôt know when her and my mom got home, or why my mom never called to tell me, but that doesn‚Äôt matter right now. I open the door, ready to receive my sister with open arms and comfort her‚Ä¶but there‚Äôs nothing. She‚Äôs not there. 

‚ÄúWhat-Lyla?‚Äù I pant, my voice rattling in my throat as I call out her name. Then my voice echoes back to me from the gap where the stairs are. 

‚ÄúWhat-Lyla?‚Äù 

Fight, flight, or freeze is a funny thing. Before I know it, I‚Äôm tugging on a thick carhartt jacket over Andre‚Äôs hoodie, stepping into boots in my pajama pants and flying down the stairs. 

‚ÄúMelly. I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù I hear her voice but I can‚Äôt see her. The glass door is open, just wide enough for a nine year old to slip out. The blood, it‚Äôs gone. The coyote, it‚Äôs gone. 

‚ÄúMelly!! Melly help!!‚Äù Her voice is beckoning me from outside. I run through the back door, slamming it shut in my wake, enough to rattle the glass panes. I hear barking as I run, wild yelping and screeching. I follow Lyla‚Äôs voice, her wails, with each crunching step of my boots against snow. I have to find her, I will find her. I find purpose in this, at least. I‚Äôll save my sister and I‚Äôll be her protector, like my dad was to me. But I‚Äôll never leave her side, not like him. 

I run until I‚Äôm at the edge of the forest. There‚Äôs no noise here. No chirping, no chittering, no barking, no Lyla.

Then, the forest explodes in a chorus of wails so loud I have to cover my ears, buckling to my knees in the snow. Harsh screeching and yelping all amalgamating into a violent, deafening melody. It slowly dies down and I hear a baby crying. An infant‚Äôs colicky cry. Then, a voice like a whisper begins pinging to my right ear, then my left. 

‚ÄúRun.‚Äù

‚ÄúRun.‚Äù 

‚ÄúRun!‚Äù 

It‚Äôs odd, it propels me forwards, shaking off the snow clinging to my knees as I stand, how it sounds like my dad cheering me on at a cross country meet the day I hit my pr. I‚Äôd almost forgotten his voice. A sickly sweet scent fills my nostrils, causing me to gag.

‚ÄúMelly!!!‚Äù Another scream. ‚ÄúMelly help!!!‚Äù I press on, deeper into the dense tree-line, thick snow crunching beneath my boots. ‚ÄúLyla?! Where are you?!‚Äù I call out in sheer desperation, eyes darting between the dark trees, fervently searching for my sister. All is quiet, save for a single wail, this time it sounds like the call of a loon. Awoo-ooo‚Ä¶ 

I nearly crumble to my knees but I press on, tears gliding down my cheeks and my neck with no abandon.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù His voice is soft and comforting, yet utterly monotone, no inflictions, nothing. I stop dead in my tracks. No, no, it‚Äôs not possible. Andre is at work, he is at work and I know this because he called me on his break. 

‚ÄúAndre?‚Äù My head is on a swivel, but I‚Äôm utterly alone in the dense woods. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù His voice calls from the left. I take a step towards it as fog rolls in, clouding the space. The moon in its grace, gives me a little light. About twelve feet away, I see a silhouette poking out from behind a tree, the outline of a man. A sigh of relief escapes me.  Andre. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here,come here.‚Äù As I get closer, my eyes are pouring tears, the cold bites, threatening to freeze them against my cheeks. 

‚ÄúAndre! You have to help me! Something took Lyla I-‚Äú 
My mind is a muddled mess but I stop, as something primal and intrinsically prey-like in me, sends a flash of warning through my senses. His hand curls around the bark of the tree with long, gangly fingers. Half of his head pokes out from behind the tree. I can‚Äôt make out his face, just the outline, but he‚Äôs tall‚Ä¶too tall‚Ä¶and his arm that reaches across the bark and strokes the tree downward is bone thin. I back up a step. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here Mel.‚Äù His voice calls out to me, not originating from the thing in front of me, but behind me. I swivel and nothing‚Äôs there. When I turn, whatever that thing is has vanished. The forest goes silent and all I can hear is the beating of my own, frantic heart. 

That‚Äôs when I hear it, another loon call. Awoo-ooo. 

‚ÄúMelly!!‚Äù 

‚ÄúLyla!!!‚Äù 

‚ÄúLyla where are you-‚Äú Long tendril fingers clasp over my mouth. I catch a glimpse of something fleshy and crimson with sagging tendons, veins, and red, bloodied skin pulled tightly to bone. Towering and utterly human in shape, but‚Ä¶inside out. 

Strange. There‚Äôs a gash in me and it‚Äôs pulling, pulling, pulling at something it shouldn‚Äôt. Oh‚Ä¶my intestines. I fall flat, a vhs tape in fallen snow, spilling its film in a tangled mess. 

Awooo-oooo‚Ä¶ 

I smell the rot, the thick stench of my own gore. If I could just get home to Lyla I could‚Äôve been more for her. Could she smell the rot all these years, my hollowed out shell? There is nothing left of me to love. Liar, liar, liar, I couldn‚Äôt crawl home even if I wanted to. My guts are spilled and splayed out of the cavernous tear in my stomach. I draw short breaths. I‚Äôm afraid. I‚Äôm sorry mom. I‚Äôm sorry Andre. I‚Äôm so sorry Lyla. If I hadn‚Äôt bowed my head to this illness my whole life, I could have been a better big sister‚Ä¶I could have been‚Ä¶I learn‚Ä¶I learn to die as I bleed out in the snow.

I've been using acespace for a while and wanted to branch out as well to other communities, hence this post! I'm 31 (nearly 32 next month) M from Brazil currently living in Portugal - 1,73m (5'8), looking for a woman  26-35 ideally from Europe so we can travel to meet each other at some point. Aegosexual/asexual, hetero and alloromantic with a passion for musicals, coffee, technology (nerdy stuff in general) and cooking. Trying to be more of the reading type and get some more movement in 2025.

The ideal person would love cuddling, hand-holding, kissing and general romantic vibes. Long conversations, quality time watching shows, playing games, travelling and just generally being around and sharing life. For me, sex is indifferent, so I'm open to that - I just wouldn't want someone with a high sex drive and don't expect me to initiate anything.

Because spending time and dates together are important to me, I don't mind a ldr to start, but we would need to meet IRL and somewhat frequent travel to be together - hence why I set more to Europe because it's easier to be from around here (and cheaper), but happy to talk to folks outside of europe if you have plans to coming here for instance.

A bit more about me: ambivert, so I can be really extroverted with the right people and in the right scenarios, and can also do it ""on demand"" but require quite a lot of resting before and after üòÖ my introvert side is stronger for sure. And while I'm generally a homebody, I love exploring cities, events, museums, hiking, coffee shops, eating out. I'm all for activities outside the house as well.

I don't want kids, and while I don't mind religion if you follow something, I'm personally agnostic. Don't smoke, sometimes drink (mostly socially). INFP-T and an Aquarius.

\- **movies I like**: High School Musical, Scream, The Incredibles, Moulin Rouge, Past Lives, Dune, Turtles All the Way Down

\- **shows I like**: Heartstopper, House MD, The Last of US, Game of Thrones, The Bear, Severance, Ted Lasso, This is Us, Schitt's Creek

1) ROOMs 
Super small , not worth what you‚Äôre paying ,en-suite rooms ?? Super small the bathroom you just step in and you‚Äôre done it‚Äôs tiny, the rest of the common spaces are okay , they provide you with like basic appliances and stuff  , STUDIO rooms , knowing from friends who lives there , you pay around 400‚Ç¨/ week , yup you heard it right , PER WEEK and can‚Äôt even start to say how disappointing as they don‚Äôt provide you with any appliances, when asked upon , they just said management decided not to .
2. STAFF 
There are few of them that are good but the others are just blatantly rude and obnoxious ( feels racist sometimes as well) in particular the property manager , she‚Äôs always up your business and bothers you for everything . If you want ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù it‚Äôs definitely a myth around there . They do random ‚Äúcompliance checks‚Äù , inspections and so on , and mostly when everyone‚Äôs at college , so they have no issues walking in to your rooms , and even if asked , they‚Äôre ignorant to give you a proper reply and sometimes they won‚Äôt even give you a proper date or time when . 
There‚Äôs been at least 5 occurrences of a male staff entering a room unannounced or without prior notice .
3. ACCOMODATION ISSUES :
This was my condition all semester 
Frequent power outages , no water (drinking or bathroom) . no long-term solutions have been provided by the accommodation management, nor has there been any transparent communication regarding the causes of these outages. There is no explanation for what is happening, and no plan has been communicated for how or when these outages will officially be resolved. There has been very little accountability whatsoever demonstrated from management. At least one student, anxious and exhausted after repeated broken promises of electricity being restored, elected to book a hotel room, taking a considerable chunk out of their already meager student budget.

Many of the services that were promised as part of the rent package are either not functioning properly or completely unavailable. These issues include:
	‚Ä¢	Rooftop Terrace Access: The rooftop terrace has been closed without any explanation or timeline for when it will reopen.
	‚Ä¢	Heating Problems: Radiators are malfunctioning, leaving some students without heating for weeks after moving in.
	‚Ä¢	Limited Bike Availability: The ‚Äúfree use of bikes‚Äù is misleading, as only 13 bikes are available for the entire building, with no clear communication on how to access them. Many students didn‚Äôt even know they existed, and most bike racks remain unused.
	‚Ä¢	Coffee Machine Issues: The ‚Äúfree unlimited coffee‚Äù is limited to one frequently broken or empty machine.
	‚Ä¢	Frequent Fire Alarms: Fire alarms go off repeatedly without warning or explanation.
	‚Ä¢	Poor Quality Furnishings: The room furniture and fittings are cheaply made and poorly installed‚Äîfloors dent easily, countertops stain, bedframes are flimsy, closets have unfinished openings, and there are paint smudges and fragile shower doors.
	‚Ä¢	Missing Items and Inconsistent Rooms: Some studios are missing essential items like blinds and shelves. 
	‚Ä¢	Misassigned Rooms: Several students were placed in accessible studio apartments instead of standard ones. These accessible rooms are smaller, have lower countertops, limited storage, and hospital-style bathrooms. No prior notice was given, yet students are charged the same high rent despite the differences.

All in all , personally they are all nice and warm in the beginning then start being invasive as hell and literally exhaust you and ruin your mental health ; Of course unless you are European or Irish , they are lowkey racist and unfair .

The same goes for the TAs in the labs‚Äîthey‚Äôre so impatient! If you ask a question twice, they act like you‚Äôre wasting their time, and their explanations are so bad I end up relying on ChatGPT or YouTube to understand anything. Ever since the semester started, I‚Äôve had so many questions for professors, but I‚Äôm too scared to ask because I feel like they‚Äôll just shut me down or embarrass me. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve never gone to office hours or talked to a single professor.

It‚Äôs not just academics either. Even the Tim Hortons workers on campus are rude. I‚Äôm literally paying for my coffee, but they act like I‚Äôm asking for a favor. One of them even said something rude about me once, and it made me so mad, but I just smiled and walked away. And today, I bought a cookie, and it gave me such a bad stomachache I ended up throwing up in the washroom.

I‚Äôm a weekend warrior, looking to chase some mountain air overnights and longer 200 mile days a few times a month. I may peak at gravel some day, but haven‚Äôt done any yet‚Ä¶so there‚Äôs that.  Occasional coffee run or commute in traffic more likely than dirt.

I live in the SF Bay Area and test rides have been near impossible to line up on the GT Pro, none for rent but there is a sweet deal that gets me in the ‚Äò24 GT Pro for several $k under the msrp (clearly a making room for the ‚Äò25‚Äôs). Even with that though, the GT is $6k more that I‚Äôve ever spent on a bike.

I don‚Äôt ride too spirited these days and never had a bike with as many creature comforts as the GT. The allure of even a windscreen + heated grips + cruise control + luggae  has me thrilled. Hitting. My late 40‚Äôs has me thinking a bit differently about how to keep my favorite hobby going!

The release of the Sport 800 has me paused a bit of maybe waiting. I‚Äôm also wondering if that the 900 will soon go goodbye from the lineup‚Ä¶Not sure what to do. 

Concerns I have it quite honestly, will I be bored on the 900 gt pro‚Äôs power delivery? Will it be too heavy for lane splitting and will it be enough of a touring bike vs the 1200? Not a bad review out there on the bike..maybe it‚Äôs just the price that is slowing me down. Any words of advice?

So the situation back in that awful cavern, for starters it was nearly impossible to see outside. Legitimately, the wall of darkness facing us was so thick you could maybe see a few feet. Night vision displayed‚Ä¶ Well, let‚Äôs just say there were a lot of them waiting out there for us. Blackburn cursed as he continued to try and key into the radio, both of us by the front entrance as we heard the gathering storm outside. Theoretically they could just burst in, tear us apart, and rewire our souls to become apart of them and the New Advent, however in old customs it‚Äôs stated some vampires cannot enter unless being invited, spirits as well.

Maybe this was some sign of their old world customs still binding them. Maybe they just couldn‚Äôt figure out how to open a door.

Either way the marshal sat back against the rock wall and took off his hat, the both of us sitting in silence as he let out a long exhale; ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt this a fuckin‚Äô tizzy‚Äù he said. He looked to the door, then back to me ‚ÄúNo comms‚Ä¶ figures cause we‚Äôre at the epicenter of this shit, but if we don‚Äôt get ourselves going? We‚Äôll be with them soon‚Äù.

12 civilians, a march the better part of at least a kilometer, against all of that adversity. We needed to move, however doing so was suicide and yet staying here was slow death. It‚Äôs like being dealt a bad hand at the poker table, but we can only hold for so long- eventually we‚Äôre gonna have to play.

Now some of you who might have known me for a while might ask what exactly Isaac and I caught up to‚Ä¶ well we were in that cave for several hours, initially trying to see if we could physically wait out the darkness. Nothing‚Ä¶ worse so time was standing still; It was 1:28am for what felt like hours. During that time while Niyol and Matsoi checked our rescued persons for injuries, Zeus was sleeping in the corner, and I sat down on a couple of old chairs and talked with the single person I‚Äôd recognized.

‚ÄúThe hell are you doing here?‚Äù I asked, completely astounded that Isaac was here, after six long years of not seeing him. ‚ÄúOh you know‚Ä¶ well, you don‚Äôt, I guess, that‚Äôs why you asked. No so I was just going about my day‚Ä¶‚Äù he says, before stopping, his single eye seeming to glance off. I waited for a moment before asking; ‚ÄúIsaac?‚Äù.

Then he said the most off putting all decade: ‚ÄúOkay weirdest thing, I can‚Äôt remember‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt remember?‚Äù. ‚ÄúNope‚Äù. ‚ÄúIsaac it has been six entire years, how can you not remember?‚Äù. ‚ÄúWell I can remember some portions‚Ä¶‚Äù he says scratching his chin: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd worked down at the local gun store, you know the one run by those two europeans? Yeah‚Ä¶ I was there for a while, started talking to this one lady and then one day she stopped‚Ä¶ being there‚Äù.

I raised an eyebrow ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ a lot of people did, that town you did all that work in? Yeah so I noticed when traffic started getting easier to navigate, heh‚Ä¶ okay yeah, bad joke. No but then‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I just remember the night sky getting darker, one day I found myself walking out of town‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, hands slapping his thighs and giving me a thumbs up like somehow that answered‚Ä¶ anything.

The long minute of silence told him that didn‚Äôt really solve anything, he scratched the back of his neck ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ tried to talk to Rosanne, you know the occult woman in town who‚Ä¶ exercised rivers and talks to trees-‚Äù.

‚ÄúYes Isaac I know very well who Rosanne is‚Äù I say sternly, to which he feigned throwing up his hands ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm glad to see you‚Äôre still you, Staff Sergeant‚Äù. From across the room, Blackburn spat some of his dip into an empty can he‚Äôd been keeping nearby ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not the military anymore, guy‚Äù. Isaac then turned in his chair to him ‚ÄúListen: Once a staff sarge, always a staff sarge‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶‚Äù he then turned back to me ‚ÄúStaff Sausarge‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs been keeping you?‚Äù.

I explained to him the offer I had gotten from PEXU all those years ago, and generally recounted some stories up until then. Isaac would make such intelligent commentary like saying loudly ‚ÄúWait you fought a Wendigo?!‚Äù. I remember distinctly Matsoi‚Äôs wife slapped him upside the head, from the way he responded I guess they got acquainted while in that cell. Something was bugging me though and I asked ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ you said you tried to contact Rosanne‚Ä¶‚Äù.

That‚Äôs when‚Ä¶ yeah, there was a look in his eye when he said it: ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt work because‚Ä¶ she disappeared first‚Äù.

These were things that would need to be handled later, but they were, for now‚Ä¶ I had a close friend back that I hadn‚Äôt seen. For those who aren‚Äôt acquainted with Isaac, I‚Äôm fairly certain my old blog series might still be up. Regardless‚Ä¶ the five of us: Myself, Blackburn, Matsoi, and Niyol, and even Isaac huddled up. The Marshal was adverse to Isaac as he eyed him, looking back to me ‚ÄúYou trust this fool?‚Äù.

I looked to see what he was‚Ä¶ Isaac was having a conversation with a cave painting. I sighed ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say when the going gets‚Ä¶ going, he‚Äôs very capable‚Äù. That being said I don‚Äôt know how Isaac had fared the last six years so‚Ä¶ time for a reintroduction I guess. John simply looked at the Idaho native remarking: ‚ÄúWell bless his heart‚Äù.

All of us convened over the table with Blackburn starting us off ‚ÄúWe have got to get moving, those things out there are surrounding us‚Äù. Isaac chimed in saying ‚ÄúWell I mean, we could always just wait out the storm. The sun will be here soon‚Äù. A few of us looked to Isaac as John rolled his eyes ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt happening, son, that darkness is eternal‚Äù.

Isaac stopped his chuckling with a ‚Äúsay what now?‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at the epicenter and caught in the snare, however our only exit out is currently directly into their maelstrom‚Äù Matsoi said looking back towards the entrance. Niyol chimed in ‚ÄúNot the only one‚Äù and proceeded to walk over towards a large old wall of the mine, he then punched through some of the rotten boards, and we helped the medicine man uncover an old forgotten passage way. He explained ‚ÄúThis used to be the only passage up before the road around was created, they seemed to have not found it. It will cut our travel to our vehicles in half. From there it‚Äôll still be a half of a kilometer journey to our vehicles‚Äù.

‚ÄúWill we be out of‚Ä¶ whatever this is?‚Äù I asked, Niyol nodded, I looked to John ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre not in some sort of snare‚Ä¶ we can easily handle whatever‚Äôs there for a few hundred meters‚Äù. We consolidated all we had, designated able bodied persons to carry any of the children or help the elderly, I prepped my night vision as Isaac walked up: ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt suppose you‚Äôve got any firepower for me?‚Äù.

I looked to Blackburn who was placing half a lip of what could be his last can in his mouth ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you fuckin look at me-‚Äù.

I sighed and handed Isaac my glock and the magazines for it ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lose it, and make them count, keep them off the-‚Äù.

‚ÄúKeep em off the civics, don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve got you‚Äù Isaac said, shoving the magazines into the pocket of his flannel. ‚ÄúIsaac you are a fuckin‚Äô civie‚Äù Blackburn muttered, to which he responded ‚ÄúI am an experienced monster hunter‚Ä¶ I saved Nolan‚Äôs life‚Äù. Blackburn looked to me unconvinced to which I confirmed ‚ÄúA few times, actually‚Äù.

This seemed to settle the Marshal‚Äôs grievances as we prepped. I led first with my kalashnikov leading the way, the dark, ancient tunnels of the navajo were as eerie as can be as the illuminator of my laser traced every possible hiding spot under white and blue night vision. Just behind me I could hear Isaac and Blackburn, Matsoi and Niyol took the rear guard to make sure no one fell behind, Zeus kept to my side the entire way.

Then‚Ä¶ the sound of wind could be heard as the faintest moonlight crept in around a corner, Isaac and I quickly cut the distance and panned out and saw a dark horizon but‚Ä¶ filled with the tiniest specs of stars. Zeus‚Äô ears were back as he let out a low growl for what laid ahead. We could hear nervous muttering from the rest of the people as they followed us like new age shepherds, Niyol panned out sighing ‚ÄúWe are just barely at the edge of it‚Äôs presence‚Ä¶ where is our vehicles?‚Äù. I quickly checked my ATAK, flipping the device back closed: 465 meters, due our 11 o‚Äôclock.

‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs go‚Äù Matsoi said, quickly we all moved as fast yet as discreetly as we could, with only the slightest wind around us in that black and indigo covered desert landscape it seemed as if everything created sound. Yet‚Ä¶ we kept moving, finally our vehicles were within sight. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ when we heard it.

The most gutteral, bone shaking roar I‚Äôd ever heard that sounded both in the distance and right behind us called out. With our two vehicles in sight I shouted: ‚ÄúMatsoi, get them loaded up, go!! Go!!‚Äù. I quickly cut to the back to provide any covering support as the herd of people led by Blackburn and Matsoi moved, I checked around for Niyol. The Medicine man was back helping a young lady escort an old woman, one of their town‚Äôs elderly, he had barely noticed the presence behind him. He turned to see‚Ä¶ what looked like a female lead from the dark, with a single slash some sort of foul substance coated his eyes causing him to scream.

‚ÄúContact!!‚Äù I shouted instinctively as I centered my laser on her and fired, a series of bright 7.62 flashes punctured her and caused her to roar as she melted back into the black. Immediately I raced over to Niyol as Zeus barked off at whatever it was, I grabbed his hand and pulled him to his feet. It looked like oil although I swear it moved as he brushed it off his eyes, her strike had cut his skin and his eyes were a mess of blood and‚Ä¶ it. ‚ÄúCan you see?‚Äù I asked, he used his rifle to push himself up ‚Äúbarely‚Äù.

In my peltors I heard John yell ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got contacts up here!!!‚Äù. We raced to see Blackburn firing off at shadows in the distance, the marshal was putting in work with his heavy lever action as Matsoi fired off his short barreled AK. What seemed to be a‚Ä¶ dog with far too many appendages broke towards the Marshal, he fired but his rifle went dry. As it leaped at him he quickly jutted it‚Äôs muzzle forward, impaling it into the thing, he then quickly hip fired his pistol. Several shots as it screamed and pulled off him, before he loaded that thing like lightning and began firing again.

Isaac and I escorted the medicine man and the last of the civilians into the vehicles when suddenly, something broke from the dark. It had antlers, rippling muscles yet somehow a lanky body. I quickly fired at it and it ducked away as I could see parts of it torn off. Another came from the opposite direction, and I could see Isaac firing away with his pistol. Just then, I turned to see one of them had somehow closed completely on top of me. I fired my rifle but it pushed the barrel out of the way, shots firing all over the horizon before my gun went dry. I pulled my weapon away, the thing had red eyes, that much I remember, several jaws all over it‚Äôs body, I remember muzzle thumping my AK into one of them and pinning it to the ground. I then reloaded as I kept it pinned, before firing into it as it writhed.

‚ÄúSarge, we‚Äôre good, let‚Äôs go!!!‚Äù Isaac yelled as he and I ducked into the back of the pick up with several of the people. I took a knee and maintained cover as I whistled, Zeus proceeded to leap almost 7 feet off the ground to land inside, crashing into several of us. As we pulled off‚Ä¶ I could see them watching from the shadows.

We weren‚Äôt done yet, not by a long shot.

Despite this the sight of a bright sky of night time stars and the moon was a boon to our morale. Our small convoy pulled back in front of the police station, Matsoi was helping Niyol out, as the people quickly left the vehicles, being greeted by several others. I scanned around to see several residents had come out of their homes‚Ä¶ including the mayor. Though to be honest I was too busy pulling off my helmet and catching my breath as I sat on the cab of the truck, Isaac pet Zeus.

There was misery and merriment, all of which was silenced as the mayor shouted in Navajo as he approached Niyol and Matsoi. From what I could see he kept gesturing to his watch, I then decided to check mine and I realized why he was so angered- we had been gone for several days.

Matsoi then pointed to the Marshal and myself, the both of us dropping down as we approached Altse. ‚ÄúHe tells me you were‚Ä¶ ambushed‚Äù the mayor said, calming himself. ‚ÄúShit‚Ä¶ we were fuckin‚Äô trapped‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs way worse, you don‚Äôt have infiltrators, you got a whole god damn invading army‚Äù Blackburn barked. I nodded, there was not much more I could add but; ‚Äúwe barely got out with everyone we had‚Ä¶ the New Advent‚Äôs laid their claws in your home, sir‚Äù.

Matsoi then nodded ‚Äúthey were giving their bodies as vessels, all we found of them were husks, and that was nearly a dozen‚Ä¶ who knows what crawled out of them!!‚Äù. It seemed the mayor had been calmed and brought onto the same page, he looked around and asked ‚Äúwhat happens now‚Äù. Matsoi seemed stumped as he controlled himself, finally having seen the proof of his woes he‚Ä¶ stopped, genuinely he probably didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd get here. Blackburn looked to me ‚ÄúYou know what I‚Äôm gonna suggest‚Äù.

The mayor raised an eyebrow as I stepped forward ‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre coming down from that Mesa, and they‚Äôre gonna besiege this place. You‚Äôll have more of those things here than you will living people. My advice? Get everyone to the best defensive position and we call in a PEXU SMU, your people may not have wanted a full unit down here, but-‚Äù.

‚ÄúBut you got enough creepy crawlies down there to usher in the new rapture, and they did a number on your guy over there and he‚Äôs custom made to mess up witches and wendigos‚Äù Isaac said from the bed of the truck. Altse seemed to pause for a moment before asking ‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ are you?‚Äù.

‚ÄúIsaac, friend of the staff sergeant‚Äù he said with a smirk and pointed to me. ‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ might‚Äôve worded that strange as hell, but he‚Äôs right‚Äù the marshal said. The mayor looked around, allowing a moment for time to stand till as he took a single exhale‚Ä¶ he nodded and patted Matsoi on the shoulder. ‚ÄúOrder everyone to the center hall, get them into the concrete cellar. Tell them all guns‚Ä¶‚Äù Altse ordered his police chief, which caused several of the male residents of the town to whoop and holler as they ran off. He then looked to Blackburn and myself ‚ÄúIf you have any friends you can send? Get them down here, you have our permission‚Äù.

Roger fuckin‚Äô that. I quickly walked off as I left my helmet and rifle in the truck, telling Isaac to keep watch, Blackburn pulled out his keyring; ‚ÄúI‚Äôll distribute our goods, you get on the line and tell that brit to send whoever he can‚Äù.

I quickly fished out my SATCOM, hooked up the tripod and antenna, connected it to my personal radio and‚Ä¶ \[‚ÄúNovember-1 to main‚Ä¶‚Äù\]. There was nothing but static and silence, I tried again; \[‚ÄúNovember-1 to main‚Ä¶ radio check, any station on this channel this is November-1, radio check, over‚Äù\].

Finally: \[‚Äú... November-1 this is main, sitrep over‚Äù\]. I‚Äôd never been so glad to hear Montgomery in my life up until that point. I gave the down and dirty‚Ä¶ there was a lot of back and forth, but I cut to the point \[‚Äúwe need a full unit down here, there are far too many PARAFOR for us to handle‚Äù\].

\[‚ÄúNovember-1, tonight there are several coordinated attacks, many of the units we had in the North American AO are tasked out. We may not be able to reinforce you, how copy‚Äù\].

I cursed, at this time some of the people and Isaac had seen, the latter kept watch as I barked back \[‚ÄúMain, this is November-1, if you don‚Äôt get someone down here we will be outgunned, undermanned, and you‚Äôre looking at a worse disaster than Tipton‚Ä¶ and the Navajo Nation vilifying us for it‚Ä¶ how copy, over?‚Äù\].

After a moment of silence: \[‚ÄúWait one, over‚Äù\]. I stood there, staring into the sky wondering how long until the stars above disappeared like they had in the desert before finally‚Ä¶ I got a response. \[‚ÄúNovember-1 this is main, you have additional forces enroute. SMU Raider is approximately 45 mikes how, how copy?‚Äù\].

4th Special Forces Group. A detachment of green berets currently led by an old friend of mine, Nicholas Walker. Yeah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôll do.

\[‚ÄúI copy all‚Äù\]. \[‚ÄúNovember-1, send any new data, and good luck‚Äù\].

I quickly grabbed my gear and staged my vic near the center hall; a concrete building with vivid paintings of the people‚Äôs history spread across in chipped blues, orange, red, and yellows. If I wasn‚Äôt working off institutionalized muscle memory I might‚Äôve taken a moment to stop, as the story of the entire Navajo people was laid out through better and worse times‚Ä¶ I guess this was another chapter for them, what would happen next would decide if it would be a good one or not, but it wouldn‚Äôt be the final one.

The sounds of nearly four dozen people ushed down the stairwell towards the back of the building could be heard as I entered, what was a carpeted center room now had all of the furniture pushed to the windows and around the door in makeshift barricades. Matsoi and Blackburn quickly unlocked the equipment cases from the church. As the Marshal lined up at least a dozen incendiary and stun grenades, the Navajo police chief quickly unsealed some cases of ammunition; ‚ÄúYou two brought more with you than my station‚Äôs stocks‚Äù.

I checked on Niyol, whose wife was busy cleaning his eyes, he raised his head instinctively to me ‚ÄúNolan‚Ä¶. Are you friends on their way?‚Äù. This was also the first time he addressed me by my name in a non-insulting manner ‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôll be here soon‚Äù. He seemed to resign to the situation, sitting back with his weapon on his lap ‚Äúwell‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs hope this final alliance stands better than the last‚Äù.

Matsoi seemed to be working a mile a minute as he scanned around ‚ÄúNot everyone‚Äôs here‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll have to do this the old fashioned way and go block to block‚Äù. I grabbed my weapon, checking it as Isaac jumped to his feet ‚ÄúI‚Äôll volunteer too, but two guys and a dog isn‚Äôt enough for a whole town‚Äù. That‚Äôs when we heard the door open, remember those townsmen who were all too energized to be called to arms? The nation‚Äôs people are extremely well versed in their old warrior skills as several were professionally armed with everything from a modern rifle to an old school bolt action, handguns, a chest rig, and all. Matsoi gestured to them ‚ÄúDwight, my men will assist you‚Äù.

‚ÄúRoger that‚Ä¶ oh, one more thing‚Ä¶ Isaac‚Äù I said, kicking over a gun case to him. He quickly opened it up, pulling out a Remington 870 that Blackburn had prepped with a side saddle, light, and extended tube. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you fuckin‚Äô break it‚Äù the Marshal barked.

Last thing he said before grabbing a bandolier of shells was: ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt dream of it, Calamity Jane‚Äù.

It was a strange feeling of the past, hoofing it down the dark streets with a vest and ACH with nods on, flanked by the armed locals as they quickly went door to door. Many of them knew who lived nearby, who would probably still be at home, we worked efficiently to comb the streets. The town wasn‚Äôt that large, we burned maybe 16 minutes before we were certain no one was around. Taking stock I stopped at an interaction as Isaac and the Navajo militiamen quickly posted up behind nearby vehicles, stone walls, around corners‚Ä¶

\[‚ÄúNovember-1 to Bravo-1‚Ä¶‚Äù\] I said trying to reach Blackburn, I could hear him but it was‚Ä¶ broken up. \[‚ÄúD-....ht, we‚Äôve ‚Ä¶. signs of ‚Äìc‚Ä¶ing, southside‚Ä¶‚Äù\] is all that came through. I looked around, our group getting restless as we stopped, I tried again‚Ä¶ nothing. The same level of interference we had at the Mesa, I took a look up and sure‚Ä¶ the stars were getting dimmer. Then‚Ä¶ contact.

The sound of tearing metal could be heard as we canned the road nothwards, a wooden plank fence with old red paint was slowly torn apart as spindly limbs punched their way through. What pulled itself over and through was this amalgamation of what looked like calcified roots and tendrils, weaving together in some horrid round form. A single haunting face like that of a wax figure that was melted to where its jaw and chun melted together, poked through, it was at least 3 meters tall. Then‚Ä¶ more sounds, from the gangways and yards, we were right at the head of an assault.

I immediately fired off a burst of rounds, firing into the thing causing a‚Ä¶ reverberation, it felt like my skull shook. Several of the others were feeling it as they fired off, some aiming towards distant sounds; ‚ÄúPick up, we‚Äôre moving!!!‚Äù I ordered. We tried a bounding retreat but elected to just turn and burn when we heard an additional noise directly to our right, the quick paced sound of metal being smashed, chain link being torn if that‚Äôs possible, something in us kicked in and we realized we were outnumbered and surrounded.

Despite this some of the navajo men laughed, one of them with a suped up AK like the one I was using firing off a few shots as I could hear muffled prayers under their breaths. I said one too‚Ä¶ we were going to need it. I daringly took a look back to see that thing gaining on us, fast, and I mean really fast, it seemed to somehow be able to pull itself ten meters at a time. Suddenly one of the men at the front of the group had his leg snagged, he dropped to the ground as he and his weapon were dragged back. I grabbed his hand with my off hand, aiming my AK at the thing which was just halfway down the black. He screamed and I could see why‚Ä¶ the tendril has metal barbs protruding out of it that dug into his flesh like a thousand fish hooks. As the sound of his skin tearing could be heard, Isaac placed his boomstock onto the thing and fired. The material tore away as it howled enigmatically‚Ä¶ I helped the guy hop back along with another militia member as we hauled ass to the center hall.

‚ÄúOpen the hell up!!‚Äù Isaac called out as the doors opened and we bolted through. Quickly a designated ‚Äúfield medic‚Äù in the form of the town doctor took the man to a triage bed, quickly looking after him as Blackburn, Matsoi, and several others took to the windows. ‚ÄúI was trying to reach you, cameras been going dead all along the southside‚Ä¶‚Äù Blackburn walked over. I switched out my magazine; ‚ÄúWe took contact from the north, John‚Äù.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ both ends of town closing in‚Ä¶‚Äù the Marshal noted. Then‚Ä¶ the sound of something landing hard on top of the concrete building, causing the lights to flicker caused everyone to stop. Dust fell off the ceiling as Zeus was barking like a mad man, Isaac looked to Matsoi ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose you got anyone on the roof‚Äù.

Then‚Ä¶ almost instantaneously, the lights went out‚Ä¶ I quickly flicked down my dual tubes, John produced a set of digital NVGs of his own as the both of us scanned around. Immediately the back up generator for the building kicked in as dim orange lights gave everyone else some light. Matsoi immediately shouted to his people, as everyone stood fast‚Ä¶ then?

The laughing. I remember something like it back in the forests of Missouri, I don‚Äôt think what is out there has a concept of humor but they know exactly what rattles us. Like a chorus, both verbal through the shadows outside and inside our minds, suddenly the sounds of dozens of them crawling all on the outside. Suddenly through the metal places and furniture placed against them, one of the windows broke‚Ä¶ then another. Then the doorknob started to turn as the howls began: ‚ÄúStay put, they‚Äôre trying to off put us‚Äù I warned, looking around at the different entrances. ‚ÄúYeah well, consider it achieved‚Äù Isaac quipped, taking cover behind a cabinet as he aimed his shotgun.

It‚Äôs then that Marshal Blackburn walked up to one of the barricade shaking his head; ‚ÄúNah, not for me‚Äù. He then pulled the pin on a flashbang, throwing it just outside as he and some of the Navajo defenders took cover. Normally they‚Äôre not as bright as you see in movies, but due to the sheer black outside, it seemed like a flash of white coated outside.

It also gave us a small glimpse of them‚Ä¶ all of them: contorted, demented forms as whatever they were destroying the physical‚Ä¶ sense, the sanity of whatever they inhabited. Gaping maws, slender, yet ginormous forms. Their laughing stopped, and they started to roar, and yell‚Ä¶. Isaac was the first to fire as one of the entities tore through an entire cabinet, it‚Äôs arms lined with spikes, as it‚Äôs skin was missing, grey and lifeless. A blast of buckshot cast her back‚Ä¶ at the other windows, the Navajo quickly took up arms and began to fire off, Matsoi commanding his people.

I was running through out, aiming my laser and taking shots to help where I could and fill gap. One of the militiamen had his shoulder cut when a hand, just a hand, reached through and grabbed hole‚Ä¶ then proceeded to rip a chunk out of him like he was wet paper. I dragged him back to the aid area with Matsoi, reloading my weapon.

‚ÄúNolan‚Ä¶‚Äù a voice through all of the loud gunfire and yelling could be heard, I turned back to see the mayor, Altse‚Ä¶ holding‚Ä¶ Well first, he seemed to have thrown on one of his old digs. Old school BDU camo, green and black, a chest rig that the vietnam rangers used to rock as in his arms was an M60, gas operated air cooled belt fed machine gun. ‚ÄúWhere do you need this?‚Äù he asked calmly. Blackburn fired off his lever action as he ducked back around the window to the wall. He looked up as he reloaded, pausing; ‚ÄúWhere the fuck‚Äôs that been?!‚Äù.

‚ÄúMy property is my business, lawman‚Ä¶ now, where do you need it?‚Äù Altse reiterated, just then the sound of something big began to slam on the front doors directly in front of us as I aimed my Kalashnikov; ‚ÄúRight here should do‚Ä¶.‚Äù. Whatever was out there had the clean mass of a trunk as the concrete shook and even cracked at the edges of the front door. Zeus assisted by grabbing the neck of one of the things as it‚Äôs contorted skull poked in, keeping it in place as Isaac unceremoniously exorcized it‚Äôs skull.  Suddenly‚Ä¶ the center doors came loose, the metal warped as one of them nearly fell off‚Ä¶ a hulking mass of what looked like limbs started to crawl through, the thing in the road.

‚ÄúGun hot!!!‚Äù Altse yelled, with the M60‚Äôs bipod mounted onto a large trough box, he took aim and fired a burst straight through the metal. Blackburn and several others ducked back as the sound shook the building, red and white streaks tearing into it as black substance flew all around the door. Another burst, I took aim and assisted, as did the Marshal and several others. The king beast withdrew with a roar torn off limbs fell through the mess of metal that was the entrance. One of them twitched and began to crawl, causing one of the medics to panic as a knife was planted into the palm‚Ä¶ by Niyol. ‚ÄúYou back to shape, old timer?‚Äù Matsoi asked as he cleaned his blade; ‚Äújust barely‚Ä¶‚Äù.

The things outside began to crawl around, shaking the building as they the sound of tearing metal could be heard‚Ä¶ then, a sound from one of the walls. Matsoi‚Äôs eyes raised ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre entering through the air system!!‚Äù. I took lead with several others, including Isaac, Zeus sprinted off towards the basement stares as the dim lighting was even worse. The cellar was an open concrete area, the townsfolk were huddling near the edges‚Ä¶ we reached the bottom. Suddenly‚Ä¶ through the HVAC unit we could hear something messily fall through and from the vent, it burst out. Miniature versions of the things began to spill out, messily, trailing their black blood behind them. One leaped for some of the civilians, however Zeus quickly leaped, pinned it down, and gored it. Another was skeet shot out of the air by Isaac who fired on the vent and turned it into a messy bottleneck for them. The Navajo defenders and I quickly took aim and fired, I stomped one before firing into another. One of them men grabbed one and whipped it into a wall as another jumped on his back, I took aim and shot it off with a single shot. Then‚Ä¶ one of the last of those things leaped for me, I turned-... and saw it hit out of the air by a metal bat, then pulverized‚Ä¶ by Matsoi‚Äôs wife who was guarding a group of the town's children.

‚ÄúCareful, Staff Sergeant‚Äù she quipped. ‚ÄúNice one, uh‚Ä¶ Sarah, was it?‚Äù Isaac quipped, she rolled her eyes and responded with ‚ÄúGlad to see you‚Äôre still topside Isaac‚Äù.

‚ÄúTechnically we‚Äôre underground‚Äù Isaac said. ‚ÄúShut up‚Äù.

From outside a loud noise could be heard, originally we thought it was yet another creature attempting to gain entry, but I immediately knew what that was. Aircraft, specifically a helicopter and the literal best thing we could hear at that point causing me to outright laugh and pump a fist. Isaac seemed confused ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt follow, those cultists didn‚Äôt give me a lunch, kinda light headed‚Ä¶‚Äù.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our back up‚Äù.

‚Ä¶ \[Log-Addendum Added‚Ä¶ Processing‚Ä¶.\] \[Author: Captain Walker, Nicholas, SMU ‚ÄúRaider‚Äù of 4th Special Forces Group\].

I‚Äôve been asked by the brass to give my perspective of our quick response deployment to the Navajo Nation, this is Captain Nicholas Walker. For those reading you‚Äôll have to forgive me, I‚Äôm used to writing OPORDERs and debriefs, planning missions, and my after action reports are dry, but I‚Äôll give as best of a retelling as to what the hell we encountered down there.

We were on QRF tasking when we had gotten the alert, we seem to be doing a lot of that‚Ä¶ probably because our specific team of America‚Äôs finest happens to be able to adapt the best against PARAFOR and their unusual circumstances. Regardless, multiple alerts had been given out and some of our sister units in Canadian JTF2, 1st Ranger Batt‚Äô, even a unit of FBI HRT based down in Virginia had been spun up. The New Advent‚Äôs roots were tightening around us and missions were more frequent than the ‚Äò07 surge. We expected something to pop off and give us a reason to roll out, I just didn‚Äôt expect it to be an old friend‚Ä¶

Montgomery‚Äôs words somewhat-exactly: ‚ÄúA joint mission to bring the Navajo onboard has gone completely bloody FUBAR, we‚Äôve got several solos stuck down there with reality warping entities having tore a damn hole in the county. They‚Äôll be overwhelmed if they don‚Äôt receive immediate assistance. Local liaison is the town‚Äôs chief Matsoi, solos tasked are US Marshal John Blackburn and Dwight Nolan‚Äù.

I‚Äôd recommended Xavier to bring Dwight in, especially after he went toe to toe with whatever the hell he found back in southern Missouri. He was an absolute firebrand of a squad leader back in our line unit, got it done but also kept his guys‚Äô heads above water mentally. Him and I kept contact tangentially however I reached out after he joined with PEXU, and I wasn‚Äôt too surprised he started tearing through target packages left and right. He might not say as much, but from a cohort of his looking in‚Ä¶ Dwight Nolan has eliminated cases as a solo than some groups of them fail to do in the greatest quantity.

So if his ass was in the fire‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say me and my boys were suited up, radios prepped, and out on that tarmac before the coffee was hot. Our ramp brief laid out a clusterfuck ahead \[‚ÄúInward communications limited, OPFOR unable to be seen on ISR, drones unable to regain visual on town due to supposed ‚Äòwall of darkness‚Äô... break‚Äù\]. I flipped my notes, keying back in; \[‚ÄúContact on entry is likely, though birds will take us in‚Ä¶‚Äù\]. I closed my boot and shoved it back in my rig‚Äôs pocket, eyeing one of the door gunners‚Ä¶ an M134 minigun, chambered in good ol‚Äô 7.62 NATO‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen those things bisect vehicles faster than you can register. If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned about my time with the unit, a healthy amount of well trained warfighters is equivocal to anything that crawls out the primordial asscrack of this universe.

We quickly entered the airspace of the town, our nods were down but we couldn‚Äôt make out a damn thing‚Ä¶ legitimately. I knew what they meant by wall of darkness because the clouds soon vanished and a void is what greeted us. The crew chief came back to talk: \[‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still able to make out altitude, once you‚Äôre on the ground we‚Äôll be unable to provide air support‚Äù\].

Not the best, though last thing we‚Äôd want is a blackhawk going down because it hit a damn light pole in a Navajo town. Try explaining that on the news, Xavier.

Soon we felt the rotors stabilize as gravity remind us we are still on earth, we exited right side, half crescent formation as we all took up sectors. Our comms sergeant chimed in, short range communications were still up‚Ä¶ the leader of my alpha team, also the one who keeps you updated on 4th Group, SSg Ivensky, kept all sectors scanned. Our warrant kept look out with a thermal as the birds left us in total darkness and silence.

That was‚Ä¶ until we could make out gunfire. The sound had the same effect as the cold, too much of it too far and it seems silent, but whatever was going down pierced that veil‚Ä¶ our people were still alive. Our medic doc said something akin to ‚Äú-Hell yeah, give ‚Äòem hell‚Äù.

‚ÄúIvensky, have Alpha pick up, we‚Äôre fucking moving‚Äù I ordered. Our warrant kept chirping in my ear; \[‚ÄúThis matches stories I‚Äôve heard about the Anaye‚Äù\]. We moved carefully as our quad nods had trouble piercing the darkness though we quickly made our way to one of the streets, we‚Äôd been emplaced on the north end of town. \[‚ÄúThe hell you talking about, chief?‚Äù\] I barked, keeping volume low.

\[‚ÄúWhen they enter our world in great numbers, their entry way sucks all energy back into it‚Ä¶ I see no stars and no sun‚Äù\] he noted. I looked around, he was right, though as he noted \[‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just the working theory‚Äù\].

Ivensky‚Äôs alpha team immediately snapped to action I saw them quickly take cover behind a nearby car aiming down the road as through the comms \[‚ÄúContact!! Five PARAFOR front!!‚Äù\]. I immediately hoofed it‚Ä¶ sure enough; two that looked like hybrids of canine and corpses, some sort of marionette, all charged, talons, bones, reaching out as they closed the distance quickly. Was nothing we couldn‚Äôt handle, I saw peq lasers on targets, cutting them down even if it did require an entire magazine each. Another leaped from one of the roofs, though alpha‚Äôs gunner took it out with one hell of a burst‚Ä¶ showered us as well.

Doc didn‚Äôt hesitate to complain \[‚ÄúDammit, I just got that West Tennessee shit out of my kit‚Äù\].

Bravo team bounded up as Alpha replenished and fell in‚Ä¶ we could see the damage these things had done. Torn up fences, cars had been smashed though it seemed as if they moved quickly. Pieces of them, calcium, rotten flesh, flaked skin, littered the ground \[‚ÄúSeems like the locals did a number‚Äù\] Bravo‚Äôs team leader, Sullivan noted, chief disagreed. \[‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no brass, this wasn‚Äôt a firefight‚Äù\] he noted, I looked over \[‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs your theory then?‚Äù\].

\[‚ÄúThey‚Äôre molting‚Äù\].

Soon we reached the center of town where the gunfire emanate, though as we approached from the east side of the center hall, we could see tracers and hear the whizz of outgoing rounds. We immediately hugged a nearby concrete wall, not wanting to catch blue on blue and become a folded flag. Our comms sergeant tried to reach them; \[‚ÄúFriendly units inside, this is Raider-Romeo‚Ä¶.‚Äù\]. Nothing, yet fighting could still be heard, one of our guys stupidly tried to peek around to see and nearly caught an AK round that tore off a chunk of the wall.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lose your head, guy‚Äù was all I could say. \[‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the play?‚Äù\] Chief asked, they were barricaded, and from what we could assess carefully‚Ä¶ multiple parafor along with a larger creature were around the entrances and possibly made entry. \[‚ÄúBreak the siege‚Ä¶ Bravo deploy a starcluster and flare to let them know we‚Äôre not flesh eaters, Alpha bound out and we‚Äôll take the center of the road‚Ä¶. Draw that big son of a bitch off the top of the roof‚Äù\].

Without hesitation Sullivan immediately slammed a silver canister into the ground, a bright burst of pyrotechnics bathed the road ahead as Ivenskyy‚Äôs team stormed out and took the center, posting up behind some vehicles. I rushed out, following behind to the far side as we saw‚Ä¶ it‚Ä¶ the thing was some mass of yarn, but instead of yarn it was limbs, spinal cords, and it face looked‚Ä¶ otherworldly. Let‚Äôs just say, it had all the right functions to see, smell, and speak, and those forward facing eyes‚Ä¶ all of them, told us it was a predator. It dropped off, limbs and flesh falling showing the damage as we engaged.

A burst from the belt fed, and our grenadiers immediately started to put rounds on target though I warned ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hit the fuckin‚Äô town hall with a 40-‚Äù. An HEDP found it‚Äôs place directly in the center of it‚Äôs chest, guts and entire bodies spilling out almost like we popped it‚Äôs sternum. We did‚Ä¶ it rushed us, a swat and several calcified talons as big as .50 rounds nearly hit us. Yet‚Ä¶ eventually‚Ä¶ the thing began to lose balance, eventually falling as its centipede-like structure caved in. It still roared as we advanced, Bravo pushed right and fired on the smaller ones still at the building, while Alpha and I approached it. Its ring of eyes looked up, I aimed my SCAR heavy and put enough rounds to pierce its crown of a skull.

\[‚ÄúLead to all Raiders, advance to the center hall‚Äù\].

\[Log-Addendum ended\]

Seeing Walker and his green eyed devils emerge from that red and smoke filled street was the best thing we‚Äôd seen throughout this long well. Immediately there was crying, cheering, some like Blackburn slumped against the walls as Altse and I emerged. Zeus immediately ran up as Walker‚Äôs men took point, the captain flipped his quad nods up ‚ÄúNolan‚Ä¶ up shit‚Äôs creek I see‚Äù.

‚ÄúRegular circumstances, yes‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou Special Forces?‚Äù Altse asked, Walker eyed the patches on the mayor‚Äôs jacket ‚ÄúFormerly 10th but yeah, you were at Stewart? Bless your soul‚Äù. I could see their warrant officer positioning guys, one of their teams quickly went around the building confirming dead parafor with two rounds each as their comms guy started to set up an advanced antenna.

That‚Äôs when Isaac caught up; ‚ÄúIs it true those things cost as much as a house?‚Äù he said, gesturing to Walker‚Äôs night vision. The Atlanta native eyed me then back to Isaac ‚ÄúMore like a truck but yeah‚Ä¶ who‚Äôre you?‚Äù.

‚ÄúIsaac‚Äù he said, resting his shotgun on his shoulder. Walker then rolled his eyes ‚ÄúThis one is Isaac? ‚Ä¶ Yeah, that tracks‚Äù.

‚Ä¶. Closing up now as there‚Äôs a lot of fallout from that. Our ties with the Navajo Nation have strengthened as that alliance baptism in fire has encouraged both sides to work together more closely. That being said it seems our victory‚Äôs gotten a lot of them pissed off, New Advent‚Äôs Ryan Evans just came on the news talking about a ‚Äúnew effort‚Äù to unite the people.

It‚Äôs going to get worse, before it gets worse. That being said, we‚Äôre in this for the long run.

Don‚Äôt believe their lies, hope isn‚Äôt dead even if it‚Äôs knee deep in a foxhole. PEXU works in the dark, and I‚Äôll be back soon, with Isaac, Zeus, and the Marshal.

I‚Äôll explain.

It‚Äôs been a minute since the end of our mission to the Navajo Nation. Truth be told, opening the car door to my driveway has never felt more tranquil‚Ä¶ That was until I heard the passenger door swing open and I could hear every single vertebrae in Isaac‚Äôs back realign as he stretched. ‚ÄúAh, home-sweet-ranch-compound, huh Dwight?‚Äù. Yes for the foreseeable future, noting our long absence from each other and his seeming inability to recall the last better part of a decade, I‚Äôve elected Isaac can shack up at my place. Zeus has seemingly taking a liking to him, although truth be told that 90lb canine assault missile will take to just about anyone that will feed him.

Sorry back on track, we were looking at several weeks of downtime, which despite the fact that I should have been focused on recuperation‚Ä¶ I could only think of piecing together what‚Äôs been happening. It‚Äôs a flaw of mine, once I‚Äôm hooked I have to see something through to the end‚Ä¶ I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm the maniac who didn‚Äôt run from the Cazamoth Estate and went to Afghanistan four separate times. Regardless we had some noncombat objective‚Ä¶ or so it seemed.

‚ÄúHey Dwight, you like decorating your house with hand prints?‚Äù Isaac quipped, my mind immediately thought back to the print indent I saw on the gutter and porch post. ‚ÄúYeah, don‚Äôt mind them, I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a thing‚Äù I said as I dragged my gear bag out of my trunk. Then something he said made the hair on the back of my neck stand up: ‚Äú... All of them?‚Äù. What did he mean ‚Äúall‚Äù of them? Well, I found out what he meant when I turned and‚Ä¶ on the wooden railing, the steps, doorway, at multiple points on the glass were more hand prints. Coating the front of the house‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd been gone for a few weeks, but this was new, this hadn‚Äôt happened before. I dropped my gear on the porch and looked at some of them, they were embedded just a few millimeters into the wood, the glass, even the stone‚Ä¶ just enough to be noticeable. All of them were human like, four fingers and a thumb, but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. They were cave painting is, archaic, weird‚Ä¶ enigmatic.

Just like the traps that were warped and bent impossibly. Just like the hundred dead birds that passed inexplicably. ‚Ä¶ This was another probe.

The only thing greeting us besides the wind and Zeus‚Äô sniffing and growling at some of the prints was the silence, all eyes were on us‚Ä¶ That was until Isaac broke the air with an all too giddy: ‚ÄúDo you have a craving for property that‚Äôs got demonic intent or is this all just happenstance?‚Äù. Guess I‚Äôm just lucky.

Truth be told, getting used to Isaac again wasn‚Äôt too much of a challenge, to be honest between him and Zeus, having people around this place again was much better than absolute solitude. Though we had our fair share of weird moments, Zeus seems to be sticking to the area immediately around the house when he trots outside, there‚Äôs an eerie feeling I‚Äôve been getting everytime I take my ATV out and scout the lands. Isaac‚Äôs been telling me the ‚Äúwalls are talking‚Äù, though that may just be the alcohol. Like, a serious amount of alcohol, we‚Äôre out in an isolated part near the rockies, where does he get that much- nevermind, rambling again, just like old times. The knocking‚Ä¶ did I tell you guys about the knocking? Well, there‚Äôs knocking everytime I go to get the coffee. Sometimes its at a window, a wall, other times from the door, one day Isaac went to go confront it but I just told him: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt answer it‚Äù.

There‚Äôs some things in this world you just don‚Äôt mess with, and I‚Äôve got some hella‚Äô spiritual blood on my hands. It will always probably be ‚Äúweird‚Äù for the rest of my life, but I guess that‚Äôs just the parameters‚Ä¶ the hand I‚Äôve been dealt. Things were starting to get worse though‚Ä¶ coyotes started to show up dead. Now it‚Äôs not unusual for Zeus to embrace his canine apex predator instincts and chase them down, then drag them back to the house to enjoy his kill right where everyone including the mailman could see it. What was unusual was for a whole pack of them to be left right at the bottom of the front steps, gutted brutally to where they were all peeled and ripped open, their blood and innards painting the front of the damn house.

I remember nearly stepping in when we went to go check, door slowly opened as I kept my glock to my right, Isaac had elected to creep out a shotgun and scan the front. ‚ÄúOkay, yeah, this place is definitely screwed, you ever think about relocating?‚Äù he remarked. Even if I wanted to, I don‚Äôt think this is something you can run from‚Ä¶ I remember Zeus sniffing at the pile, only to back off and growl at it with his ears back refusing to eat any of it. We went to my office on the second floor where I had the entire property‚Äôs motion sensors, cameras, and surveillance set up‚Ä¶ it happened last night, although no motion sensors triggered it. We found the point of appearance and‚Ä¶ well.

2:17am; the porch is clear and everything is fine, night vision on my cameras gives us damn near a 360 view of the property and every inch of it from where the pavement turns to gravel, and then to grass. Then‚Ä¶ it all appeared instantaneously: the dead coyotes, the blood to the point where some of the lenses were even smeared, all of it. Isaac and I zoomed in on the exact millisecond, opening maybe there was some cut off or something to show what happened‚Ä¶. Nothing. .01: it‚Äôs not there, .02, all of it. Whatever did this, didn‚Äôt do it through conventional means.

‚ÄúWhat do you think it could mean?‚Äù Isaac asked, flipping through all of the cameras showing every angle of the carnage. I‚Äôll tell you what I told him‚Ä¶ something was sending a message, in the same way bodies are strung up at the front of bridges to ward off enemies this was the same thing. Isaac had a different theory, he pointed to an image of the pile: ‚ÄúThe blood is one thing, but the bodies? They seem to be in the form of an‚Ä¶ offering‚Äù.

I was dumbfounded and my face probably showed my confusion: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù. My Idaho alcoholic went on to explain: ‚ÄúThink about it‚Ä¶ This is a crossroads, right, you got the Dakotas to our northish, west is red rock territory, south is Texas and Oklahoma, this is a merging area of all kinds of nasty shit, that‚Äôs why so many different things happen‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve seen uglies leave carcasses and stuff out as a warning, this‚Ä¶ the way they‚Äôre like, placed all together like a meat wicker basket. Seems like they were presenting it to you. Gotta remember, things don‚Äôt work like people do‚Äù. If this is the way things worked, then it could happen on the opposite: just as something could show you respect, something else could target you.

We kept moving though; carcasses went in the trash and I took a power washer to the front of the house, and after some replacing of tiles, wood, the majority of the handprints were gone. I was tired of running and I wasn‚Äôt about to let anything scare or force me off this land, well, force ‚Äúus‚Äù now I guess as this isn‚Äôt a one man circus anymore.

Likewise there‚Äôs been developments on the grander scale, more specifically the shadow war PEXU is embroiled in against our adversaries. You ever wonder who leads the Blackwood Brotherhood? It‚Äôs a question that‚Äôs been raised by many, while the New Advent has Ryan Evans we all know that man‚Äôs nothing more than a gray skinned puppet with darkness behind his wide toothy smile. After he appeared at that meeting where he addressed the world flanked by politicians from north and South America, Europe, leading figures in economics and big tech‚Ä¶ an investigation was launched by the CIA‚Äôs Special Collection Service to track when this huge shift in momentum for them happened. They sorted through tens of thousands of emails, phone calls, texts, and found almost nothing relating to the New Advent at all.

Then‚Ä¶ a singular message shared on an encrypted messaging app by some lower level informant shells connected to our adversaries sent everyone into a panic. ‚ÄúBelial‚Äù; in Hebrew it means the Devil, in the context they found it in it reignited a manhunt that had gone cold nearly 32 years ago. Believed to be the victim of a death camp in the middle east, he was being tracked by Israeli intelligence for quite some time after a special mission unit they sent to capture him all turned up dead. No wound, blemishes, nothing, just cold and unalive. After that he fell off the grid and ever since they it‚Äôs been nothing but theories connecting him to the primordial death cult we currently face: cells found in Denmark, Great Britain talked about an Augur from Damascus instructing them to revive the PARAFOR leading to shit we are still fighting to this day. Every connection from groups or training groups we get stops, no names, no ranks‚Ä¶ just the tale of a man with dark red skin, sunken eyes and a bright white smile. His lips supposedly gone from acid burns that also line his body. Yet‚Ä¶ it was all conjecture, drawings in scribbles of mad men who died when they allowed ancient shit to crawl out of their bodies like molted animals.

Until one single message: *‚ÄúBelial will lead the way‚Äù.*

Then it all hit the fan: two operatives PEXU had with us, one from the agency and the other homeland security were found dead outside of a site that doesn‚Äôt exist on any manifest in the United States internal security directorate. No documentation exists because all of it‚Äôs funding is from black budget. The recovery teams assigned to retrieve them became casualties themselves as whoever left them there carved glyphs into their eyes‚Ä¶ the same one the Blackwood uses for indoctrination. Shortly after? Deep in the Amazon ABIN, Brazil‚Äôs premiere intelligence network, was searching for a facility hidden in the rainforest connected to the cult. Attached to them were some members of the Special Activities Division‚Ä¶ almost all of them didn‚Äôt make it out alive, half of them were grievously injured. A completely compartmentalized operation was compromised and ambushed‚Ä¶ worst yet was the place they were hunting for disappeared. Every piece of metal, everything from the satellite photos was gone, like it never existed.

2 steps forward, 3 back into the woodchipper.

I won‚Äôt lie, my security office has turned into that of a makeshift war room with pelican cases and tough boxes lining the walls, a rack securing my armament, and a cork board of all I‚Äôve learned complete with red string. The noose was tightening around our neck, 2 intelligence agencies experiencing major breaches, vew few within he FBI can be trusted and even MI6 needs to work in the shadows. Everyone from megachurches to corner stores is starting to wear those golden bands, and no one seems to be noticing. Not a peep or a whisper, anyone who does goes missing‚Ä¶ 110,000\~ a year and counting, if even a tenth of that has been turned into vessels for ascension then we are neck deep in enemies. Honestly staring too deeply into it all laid out like that makes me nearly go mad sometimes, sitting back in an armory knowing that just weeks ago we fought through hell just to get ourselves an inch of breathing room.

‚ÄúOh lord, don‚Äôt tell me, you‚Äôre going insane aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Isaac‚Äôs voice managed to draw me out of it with an eye roll as he walked in and took an eye at the board: ‚ÄúHey Dwight, if you are succumbing to whatever MKUltra stuff they pumped into your veins, give me a heads up so I can get out of the blast zone alright?‚Äù. We seemed to stare at each other for a good long while as he took a step closer to he, chuckling ‚ÄúAh! I‚Äôm just messing with yah, but for real, did they‚Ä¶ put anything in your coffee? I mean you never drank coffee last time I‚Äôd seen you so I‚Äôm wondering if you‚Äôre the real Dwight‚Ä¶-‚Äù.

Isaac somehow manages to say so much and yet nothing at the same time. He leaned back against the wall next to it, crossing his arms ‚ÄúSo, what now?‚Äù. I shrugged, I leaned back and grabbed my coffee that was sitting atop a palette of ammo cans ‚ÄúWe wait until we hear more‚Äù.

‚ÄúOh come on! There‚Äôs gotta be something we can do, call up that Hogwarts fellow of your, Montana-‚Äù.

‚ÄúMontgomery‚Äù I corrected him.

‚ÄúYeah sure, we can still do something, get back out there, hop in our supe-d up mystery machine and take it to ‚Äòem!‚Äù he said emphatically, pumping his fist in the air. A supe-d up mystery that had the transmission blown to hell ever since I had to floor it over a sasquatch back in the Dakotas‚Ä¶ more on that later.

‚ÄúIsaac, we‚Äôre part of an organization‚Ä¶ well, me, but-‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am too?!‚Äù Isaac said, I pinched the bridge of my nose realizing my mistake. ‚ÄúNo, I am, you are unofficially by association‚Äù. ‚ÄúStill, how‚Äôs the pay?‚Äù. ‚ÄúTerrible‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe benefits?‚Äù. ‚ÄúWorse‚Äù. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the incentive?‚Äù he asked, raising an eyebrow.  
‚ÄúDuty‚Äù. ‚ÄúOh god you guys really are insane‚Äù.

You think? Mortals using the modern day‚Äôs best armaments to cut through the hordes of wherever-the-hell to send whatever-the-hell back to where it was summoned from by other mortals. I‚Äôve seen more of our people succumb to injuries that can‚Äôt be determined by our laws of universe than slashes and guttings, yet I still clock in. There‚Äôs definitely something wrong with me.

‚ÄúI guess that gives us some time to think‚Ä¶ or well, remember‚Äù Isaac said, rubbing his head. It was no secret his lack of memory was weighing on him, he does a good job putting up a front. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had no contact with anyone? Haven‚Äôt been back there in?‚Ä¶‚Äù I asked, his eyes snapped to me ‚ÄúToo long‚Ä¶‚Äù. We had ourselves, the cult, but then there was Theodore Cazamoth, my old boss who was obsessed with seeing how he could industrialize the primordial to advance humanity. ‚ÄúAdvancement‚Äù that 4th Special Forces Group encountered on more than one occasion and lost more than a few of their own. We had been so dug in fighting a subversive apocalypse, what the hell was Theodore able to do the last 6 years?

We were going to have to find out‚Ä¶ later. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hitting the hay, let me know if some demon tries to tear our hearts out in the middle of the night, yeah?‚Äù Isaac said heading for the door. ‚ÄúWilco, if you get the chance before me, dump my body down a flight of stairs‚Äù I joked. Isaac stopped at the door as he looked around, then back to me ‚ÄúHey Dwight‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre back‚Äù. The sincerity in his words seemed to sober me up, the same feeling that drew me back to this years ago‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why I keep marching on. Not insanity or money, duty‚Ä¶ someone had to make the shit in the dark afraid, someone had to go in there and get vengeance for the grieving spouse, the crying child, the mourning parent, or those who went alone with no one to remember their name. I did‚Ä¶ every single person I have gotten some pound of justice for.

I woke up later around witching hour to grab a water. Zeus stayed in bed as I headed downstairs with iron in my pocket just in case someone wanted to try. I rounded the bannister as I reached the bottom of my stairs, my front door just ahead of them as the entire living room was laid out with a couch, chimney, table and all‚Ä¶ I stopped as my eyes snapped to the chair in the corner. I drew my pistol and tried to hit the light, nothing‚Ä¶ my finger felt the rail underneath where it should have been. A light then shined on me causing me to squint my eyes, it aimed down as my eyes adjusted‚Ä¶ it was my taclight.

‚ÄúYou rely on your equipment too much, Dwight Nolan‚Äù the figure sitting in the chair said, that of an impoverished male‚Äôs voice. The moonlight just barely missed them as shadows cloaked them, they tossed the taclight to me causing it to bounce across the floor. With my pistol still aimed I reached down and placed it back on and got a good lock at them. In a dark suit and dress shoes was a bald man, gray skin with dozens of stitches of different sutures lined their head. A black set of shades hid their eyes as on their lap they held what looked to be a chalkboard.

*‚ÄúDwight Anthony Nolan. 39 years old. Son, Leader, Killer‚Ä¶‚Äù.*

Tally marks were underneath, hundreds of tally marks‚Ä¶ each one of them dark red, whispering to me. I knew what they meant‚Ä¶ a name, an age, a birth and death date. Some were the things I had been ordered to cut down, target packages filled in the dozens‚Ä¶ over a hundred. I looked to them, then back to the man; ‚ÄúWho the fuck are you?‚Äù.

‚ÄúA watcher, numbers keeper mostly‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou got some sort of point in doing this? I‚Äôve got half a mind to-‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a lot of blood on your hands‚Äù the stitched up freak said accusingly. ‚ÄúWhat? Sad I put down your friends? Or something in the woods, or the swamp, or across the ocean. I‚Äôm not gonna apologize‚Äù I growled, my finger well on the trigger as I started to apply force. ‚ÄúWhat about them?‚Äù it said staring blankly at me, pointing to another tally mark‚Ä¶ Alyssa, Age 23, born in the Navajo Nation, died because we weren‚Äôt fast enough to reach her house to tell her to get to safety. It‚Äôs hand pointed to another‚Ä¶ These weren‚Äôt just kills, these were people I had failed to save. Sometimes it was because I had a wrong lead, other times I was just too slow, some there was nothing I could do‚Ä¶ but it was on my soul.

‚ÄúProtectors have continued to form a membrane of annoyance for thousands of years, Dwight Nolan. We are closer than ever to shifting the momentum back to the era where you hid in the caves protected by a campfire and a stick‚Äù It said with glee in it‚Äôs voice. It was well aware of the pressure going on around the world, it knew that I knew as well‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt give it an inch. ‚ÄúWell you won‚Äôt be there to see it‚Äù I said, pulling the trigger‚Ä¶ the gun didn‚Äôt fire. I raised an eyebrow as suddenly I could hear pounding on the door that made my heart shoot straight into my throat.

‚ÄúNo, Dwight Nolan, you won‚Äôt. You didn‚Äôt really think hiding in the rockies would save you, would it?‚Äù my light went out‚Ä¶ and I woke up in bed. That being said, I woke up to a chorus of alerts coming from the speaker on my night stand; \[‚ÄúMultiple intrusions detected‚Ä¶ multiple intrusions detected‚Ä¶. Condition Alamo, Condition Alamo, Condition, Alamo‚Äù\].

Something had followed us home.

Dossier: Condition Alamo Alamo‚Ä¶ in every military there‚Äôs a contingency when deployed for whenever the wire is breached and the enemy has entered. The Poles I worked with liked to use the term Red, a Brit unit I worked with preferred Direct Fire Charlie. I‚Äôve always stuck with one I‚Äôve encountered at a number of American Fobs: Alamo.

Zeus was barking a storm as I could hear banging coming from the front door downstairs, for reference I bought a steel lined reinforced door with heavy duty hinges and several locks. That being said I had also gotten into scraps with things that cut through material tougher than it with no issues. I had minutes at most‚Ä¶ I scrambled out of bed to find my pistol on my nightstand, drawing it and scanning around. Zeus was standing on the bed growling‚Ä¶ the banging had stopped as I looked‚Ä¶ no moonlight just like there had been hours ago.

I approached the curtains and peeked just under the edge to see, only to find an eye staring back. It was completely white, the iris gone with a pinprick needle for a pupil‚Ä¶ my blood ran cold, I remember that kind of eye. I stumbled back and aimed my boomstick but only darkness remained. Then‚Ä¶ laughter, dozens of different cackles, jeers, echoed from the outside‚Ä¶ this wasn‚Äôt right, this‚Ä¶ I had been here before, I had encountered something exactly like this‚Ä¶ back when I was just a security guard hired to protect that fuckin‚Äô forest estate.

Fuck this, we need to kit up quick. I opened the my door and shined my pistol light around, clear left and right, a few doors ahead of me were the bathroom and a study, directly to my right was the armory. I took a step out, watching the stairs down to my left‚Ä¶ only to be deafened when a gunshot rang out to my right‚Ä¶ The round barely missed me as it hit the doorway of the bathroom just in front of me, the snap and wood shavings from it showering the area as I ducked down and gripped my ear, aiming my boomstick, it was Isaac‚Ä¶ who immediately waved his hands.

‚ÄúAh hell!! Sorry!!!‚Äù. ‚ÄúIsaac what the fuck?!‚Äù I exclaimed, though I could also barely hear him as he walked over and shouted. I nursed my ear as he asked ‚ÄúHello!? You hearing me?!‚Äù.

‚ÄúNo, you deafened me!! The hell did you say?!‚Äù I asked, his answer sent a chill up my spine: ‚ÄúLook I had already seen you just before the house started to scream at us, and you nearly bit my fuckin‚Äô head off!!‚Äù. Seen me? I stood up as I scanned around ‚ÄúIsaac what the hell are you talking about?‚Äù.

‚ÄúI woke up just before the alarms started to go off, you were creeping over my bed and I was getting a bad vibe‚Ä¶ then you tried to leap on me, and I grabbed this and started to fire into you-‚Äù he said showing the Glock 19 I had given him as a bedside carry. This was odd because that was sure to have woken me up. I looked to him, my ears still pounding ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ where did‚Ä¶ I go?‚Äù I asked. A crash from downstairs caused both of us to turn and aim at the stairwell down,, Zeus had crept into the hall and began to growl at it. I reached over and pulled him by his collar ‚ÄúIsaac‚Ä¶ into the safe room, now‚Äù.

All three of us got into that armory as Isaac locked the door, I took to the desk connected to the security system as Isaac went to work preparing himself some firepower. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?!‚Äù he asked and frankly I was asking the same thing. I pulled up the grid to my property‚Ä¶ out of the several dozen motion detectors and trail cams I had set up, over 60% of them were offline, the rest were in states of damage, flickering, and only a few worked‚Ä¶ one of which was one adjacent to my driveway. A single pinprick eye looked through the tall glass, then before I could even register it‚Ä¶ a flash of silver, blackened nails on a bloated dead hand pried the camera‚Äôs steel and concrete embedded post out of the ground and smashed the unit.

That skin‚Ä¶ that hand.

I switched between the cameras, so many of them were out of commission. Some were smashed and nearly tore off their mounts, others just flashed LED colors with fragments of their vision still intact. The driveway ones were already taken out, the one on the front of the house was completely offline, something had already invaded the property and taken out our eyes‚Ä¶ not only that, but it knew where to look. I saw the notification for sound being registered, I got some crackles, static, like I expected‚Ä¶ but then, cackles‚Ä¶ deep, warped cackles of what sounded like a dozen people forced into one.

I had‚Ä¶ stopped this, I thought I did.

Then, just as I did one more run back through all of the cameras‚Ä¶ unit 21, mounted near the peak of the back of the house, highest up‚Ä¶ registered a voice. It came through calm, almost a whisper, but like some sort of predator that caught it‚Äôs prey it called out: ‚ÄúNolan‚Ä¶.‚Äù. A sudden thrash as something monstrous running across the roof shook the whole damn house, caused me to almost lose balance as I held onto the house.

‚ÄúWhat-in-the-bayou-fuck is going on?!‚Äù Isaac said, looking over my shoulder. I looked back to see he had gotten himself 2 bandoliers of shotgun shells, including a belt‚Ä¶ while in his tank top and shorts. Zeus was barking, as the sound of something crawling around the outside caught his attention. Then‚Ä¶ the movement on the roof stopped, towards the center; wet tearing and ripping, flesh and tendons, I know that sound anywhere, echoed‚Ä¶ as thuds sounded on the roof. I switched off the cameras and made for my equipment table, prepping my rifle as I pulled my belt and plate carrier on.

‚ÄúIs that shit sounding like what I think it‚Äôs sounding?‚Äù Isaac asked, aiming his shotgun around at whatever the hell was deciding to demonically touch every ceiling tile out there. He was feeling the familiar feeling too, this rhymed all too closely to whatever the hell was at the Cazamoth estate. ‚ÄúThose intelligence leaks‚Äù I pointed out, ‚ÄúYou think they found us as well?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI think something found us‚Ä¶‚Äù; I tried to key into my radio; \[‚ÄúMain this is November-1‚Ä¶‚Äù\].

Nothing, I tried again: \[‚ÄúNovember-1 to Main, serious situation, I need support‚Ä¶.‚Äù\]. Still nothing, dead silent, I looked back to him ‚ÄúEither our comms are cut, or our friends are preoccupied‚Äù.

Front outside towards the front, a thunderous roar sounded followed by what I knew damn sure was my front door being forced off his hinges and the snap of my bannister soon after. Isaac snapped towards the door with his shotgun as I pulled down my night vision, my rifle‚Äôs laser trained on the door as well. ‚ÄúSo? What‚Äôs the plan? Sit tight and wait for help?‚Äù Isaac asked.

‚ÄúHelp ain‚Äôt coming Isaac, and by the time we even get a word out for help these things will be right ontop of us‚Äù I said, the sounds growing louder. The barrel of his shotgun dipped every slightly ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what do we do?‚Äù.

Simple: ‚Äú-We get the hell off my lawn‚Äù.

Zeus began to bark as a set of footsteps raced up the stairs and towards the door could be heard, the sound of a woman‚Äôs full lung scream growing louder. It began to slam on the door again, and again, finally it gave way and she stumbled in. In some tattered gown barely covering her dead skin soaked in what looked like tar. Her arms were bisected longways as she clawed at the floor more insect than human, through her long hair she looked to us, her face peeking through as whatever was coating her at through it‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how she was even screaming, just a gap in her skull where her face was. She roared again; ‚ÄúAh Jesus hell!!!!‚Äù Isaac yelled as he blasted her in the chest with his shotgun. The scatter blast tore through her hip and momentarily stopped her, however she used her multiple limbs to launch right at us‚Ä¶

I responded with a group of shots, tearing through her torso, she fell onto the large wooden ready table I had in the center sending ammo cans of rounds tumbling off, and tools flying. Zeus barked snapping his jaws at her from the ground, she stood up and Isaac got one hell of a good shot at her shoulder.

She went flying back against the wall, Zeus grabbing onto her leg and beginning to kill shake it out of her socket. I joined and fired several rounds, the snap of my suppressor echoing as they impacted her brainstem. That corrosive shit splattered all along the wall as she grew still. Zeus seemed to back off, he could tell from the smell that none of that was good. A moment of still occurred and I closed the distance, I used the tip of my suppressor to move her head to the side as that shit fell onto the floor. I watched it impact the floorboards‚Ä¶ the black ichor seemed to‚Ä¶ move. My mind thought back to the plastic baggie of shit I had encountered, between the coloration, the eyes, the laughs‚Ä¶ the substance.

‚ÄúThis is from the Cazamoth Estate-‚Äù I stated my theory as I knelt down next to the corpse. ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt no way though, I read your entire memoir on that, you killed those freaks‚Äù Isaac said, scanning around with his Mossberg not wanting to even think of the theory. ‚Äú-Then tell me, Isaac, what the hell are they filled with the exact same shit from south Missouri?‚Äù I barked back. Our debate was cut short as a rumbling could be heard, inside of the walls. We could hear every single shuffle, and pained movement as it closed in on the vent‚Ä¶ it fuckin‚Äô popped off, a set of bloated dead arms, skin that cut itself on the metal edges and spewed puss, reached through as they aggressively tried to force themselves through. Two slimy heads, eyes sunken in dark rings, pin prick eyes and brown toothy smiles were attempting to force themselves through, to the point the wall around the vent opening contorted and bent. ‚ÄúIsaac!!! Nolan!!! Isaac!!! Nolan!!!‚Äù their voices sung with each other as they screamed. There was something about their aggression, their hatred I could feel through their forced smiles that was just shocking, making you feel like prey. I didn‚Äôt say a word, I fired my rifle, tearing through their skin, Isaac let loose with his shotgun.

The resulting blast of buckshot tore through the vent, showering the trio in pellets and broken metal, as the floor and wall around was torn up, all that remained was a pile of mess that was once human. I turned towards him ‚ÄúStill skeptical now?‚Äù. Isaac steadied himself the best he could, his stock in his armpit as he sheepishly dug‚Ä¶ oh for fucksakes, he dug a flask out of his shorts and tool a long sip; ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm right here with you‚Äù.

‚ÄúFor fucksakes, Isaac‚Ä¶‚Äù I shook my head, he looked ‚ÄúWhat?! They‚Äôre invading, I‚Äôm standing our ground!!!‚Äù.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say redecorate my entire fuckin‚Äô house with double ought buck while you‚Äôre plaster out your-‚Äù our argument was cut short as the sounds of more of them from the stairwell could be heard. ‚ÄúHow about this: We clear this place of ghouls, and I‚Äôll fund the reconstruction‚Äù Isaac quipped. With what money, Isaac? you sleep on my couch‚Ä¶ or well, figuratively, or he‚Äôd be down there getting possessed and quartered by the neighborhood brigade right now. ‚ÄúWe beat them before, we can do it again, let‚Äôs go‚Äù I asserted to him, he nodded and followed.

My laser scanned as we pushed into the hallway, Isaac cleared right as I pushed forward towards the stairs, he joined me as Zeus was at our feet sniffing ahead. I was on the left side of the hall, my laser aimed down the stairs, I could see the remnants of the door hinges torn clean off‚Ä¶ they were rated for 3,500lbs of incoming force, whatever came through here did so with a vengeance.

We pushed down the stairs, my barrel leading the way and centered on the wide open front door as Isaac watched our flank. As I reached the ground floor, I shuffled right and pied around the opening, I could hear them running throughout the tall grass, laughing, whispering, eyes peeking out and then ducking back with speeds too quick for their hulking forms. all peeking through as they could see me better than my dual tubes could. Then from the tall grass, one of them bolted out. ‚ÄúIncoming!!!‚Äù I yelled, heading over to the doorway I fired as the gray mass closed the distance across my front area onto the porch. I fired rounds that cut through it‚Äôs back, lodged right in it‚Äôs body, black splashes filled the are and yet it still kept it‚Äôs momentum.

‚ÄúMove!!-‚Äù.

That‚Äôs all I could get out as Isaac ducked right, Zeus barked as the thing charged and knocked me clean off my ass through the air and into my couch. It didn‚Äôt seem to care how many rounds I fired into it, I rolled off and groggily got a good lock. Its still human torso was the cross roads for a horrifying monstrosity where dog-like legs met an army that was that of a centipede, but the chitin was made out of calcified black flesh. The other one was seemingly made of glass and had gaps between bones, the head was fighting between several different mouths, gray and sunken into it‚Äôs torso‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs sunken pin prick eyes centered on me

Whatever the hell happened to it, it decided to turn their soul into some sort of skin split thing. It‚Äôs voice was that of dozens, roars, yells, and yet it semi coherently all said: ‚ÄúNolan‚Äù.

I tried to back up as it reached down, the centipede arm gnawing at my plate carrier, tearing through the nylon cordura as I fired into it‚Äôs torso sending chunks of flesh and bone flying out the back. Zeus lept on top zinking his teeth into it‚Äôs neck causing it to yell what sounded like a cross between a tiger and a ma. Isaac planted his shotgun right on the skull, the shot caused the entire thing to explode out which completely showered me‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt know what was worse: being covered in dead person or dead rotten beast.

I forced my buttstock into the ground, my head still rolling around as Isaac took point and looked to me: ‚ÄúHow you feeling? You got knocked a country mile‚Äù.

I felt the base of my neck that still felt like it was on fire: ‚ÄúBeen worse, landed right on my neck. ‚ÄúQuick, how many fingers am I holding up?‚Äù. ‚ÄúIsaac you‚Äôre not holding up any‚Äù. ‚ÄúSee? You‚Äôre good‚Äù.

From the doorway to the kitchen, a set of elongated arms connected to a body that was stretched and contorted beyond human proportions. It stepped in bow legged, its face‚Ä¶ a human skull that had been buried and pushed into the collar bone area sat below a smooth, angler fish like top portion. Two sets of jaws forced together, formed some horrifying maw that just hurt to look at,  like knives being dragged down my bare bones. We quickly fired on it, it grabbed onto the ground around it and spat at us‚Ä¶ that same tar like shit, Isaac was quicker that I was. Some of it hit directly on the plate carrier, eating into my ATAK. The smell was‚Ä¶ awful, it began to fuck with me, I didn‚Äôt know it until well into it‚Äôs effects but soon I realized I was hallucinating.

My eyes burned, my nose doing everything it could to exorcize the feeling to no avail, the pounding noise in my head felt like screams and chants. It felt real, every gust of wind, everything was hypersensitive. I scanned around, the ground unsteady, then it lunged at me. I could feel it‚Äôs claws slashing into my skin, I screamed and fired at it although it just degloved my arms like it was nothing, I could see the veins and blood underneath as it threw me into a wall and it gave in. I stood up and I was back‚Ä¶ upstairs? The thing came charging down and I managed to clip the human skull underneath, causing it to stumble. As it did I fired, the flash of my suppressor under nods short, small, yet controlled as I tore through one of it‚Äôs legs.

It then reached out and hooked my jaw‚Ä¶. Then pulled and yanked it clean off. The feeling of my tongue flapping around, my gasps for air‚Ä¶ I dropped my rifle to it‚Äôs sking as it slashed at my face. I fell to the ground, back in the living room‚Ä¶ Zeus was now gnawing at it‚Äôs head as it reached for him.

Not. My. Fuckin. Dog. I fired an entire magazine into it, having switched to auto it tore through it‚Äôs center off mass. I then charged forward and tackled it to the ground, the armored knuckles on my gloves being buried into it‚Äôs head. It‚Äôs elongated arms tried to reach and tear through my plates, I didn‚Äôt care, hell I took off my helmet and began to pound it over, and over, with the clear side of my kevlar. The burning feeling it had on my corneas combined with a chorus of screams that just wouldn‚Äôt end, I would make it end. It‚Äôs head snapped back as it began to be crushed, soon the vortex-like swirls that formed it‚Äôs eyes began to snap back‚Ä¶ looking human, and looked‚Ä¶ like me.

Isaac threw me to the ground, I gasped as I could feel the clear air again, my vision normal as the property, the house‚Ä¶ everything was silent. Zeus was sat in the center carpet‚Ä¶ surrounded by dozens of malformed, transformed adversaries that were now spending their last seconds on this earth bleeding out. I sat up, catching my breath. I looked around‚Ä¶ the beast with the elongated arms was laying on the floor, it‚Äôs head completely pulverized‚Ä¶ my helmet embedded into it. I looked to Isaac, I‚Äôll be honest I was shaken the fuck up ‚ÄúW-What the fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah you lost your shit‚Ä¶ a bunch of them began to pour in, you were firing wildly, you started tearing them apart‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, I raised an eyebrow, I didn‚Äôt remember that and I still don‚Äôt but I looked around. There was a hole in my wall wide open into my kitchen‚Ä¶ some sort of hound like beast, skeletal with blood and muscle being it‚Äôs only exterior had it‚Äôs throat ripped out and my multitool stuck in its skull. My rifle was on the ground, bolt locked to the rear amongst several others.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear anything else‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, staggering to my feet. ‚ÄúYeah, I think we might‚Äôve gotten them all‚Ä¶‚Äù Isaac said, he paused for a moment, looking around ‚ÄúOkay, no jinxing us this time, I think they‚Äôre actually all dead‚Ä¶ or escaped‚Äù. I quickly cleared and replenished my rifle, Isaac and I secured the kitchen and basement, right around when we got primary power back on‚Ä¶ my radio crackled to life.

\[‚ÄúNovember-1, sitrep‚Ä¶‚Äù\] it was Montgomery‚Äôs voice. I looked to Isaac before hitting the push-to-talk; \[‚ÄúThis is November-1, just experienced an attack on my residence, it got kinetic‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre still alive but in a bad way‚Ä¶ how copy?‚Äù\].

A few seconds of static, some failed key-in attempts‚Ä¶ Montgomery answered \[‚ÄúRoger that‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got an organization wide attack‚Ä¶ stay put and prepare the best you can‚Äù\]. Isaac scoffed, rolling his eyes he kicked the mangled remains of something that was formerly intruding, now decomposing ‚Äúyeah, tell manchester it‚Äôs a little late for that‚Äù.

\[‚ÄúNovember-1 to Main, I‚Äôve got several dozen EKIA, I need reinforcements-‚Äù\].

What he said next planted a deep pit in my stomach: \[‚ÄúDozens of PEXU solo units have not reported back in, November-1. We‚Äôre barely able to take accountability. Hunker down the best you can and we will be coming for you‚Ä¶ Main-Out‚Äù\]. There Isaac and I stood in my house, I sighed as he slung his shotgun, looking around ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶. Nail and boards?‚Äù.

I pinched the bridge of my nose; ‚ÄúWhat are we going to just board up all the holes and sit next to the radio?‚Äù. We did, it took around 25 minutes however Isaac and I successfully and haphazardly re-secured the house. Occasionally we would hear the sound of something outside, neither of us went to look however we did keep our weapons ready, nothing would attack again. In the morning the sound of an SUV approaching after the sun rose above the horizon cautioned all three of us to approach, my suppressor and his barrel sticking out gaps in the boards.

The blacked out vic parked in my driveway, the door opened and a young man in a navy suit, slicked back hair exited. He kept his hands up, only moving one to take his sunglasses off‚Ä¶. Montgomery chuckled at the state of things before he looked at the structure: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it, you‚Äôve had a very entertaining night, November-1?‚Äù.

I drew my barrel back from the opening and peeked through ‚ÄúYou can say that‚Ä¶ how‚Äôs everyone else doing?‚Äù. The smirk on his face faded as he sighed, approaching ‚ÄúSMUs survived intact, many weren‚Äôt touched for obvious reasons‚Ä¶ others like yourself, intelligence personnel‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say we‚Äôve got less comrades than when the night started‚Äù. That‚Äôs where we are at right now; Isaac and I are still holding down the fort, surprisingly we‚Äôve gotten the actual structure resecured but let‚Äôs just say it won‚Äôt be pretty for some time. I don‚Äôt plan on leaving anytime soon‚Ä¶ this place is my home, I hid here when I wanted to step away, and I don‚Äôt plan on running off again. PEXU has taken a considerable amount of casualties, though we‚Äôve sustained it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time for us to hunker down, lick our wounds, and soon we will be counter attacking. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs not, just a little bit shot to hell right now‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll get back to it.

We‚Äôll take it to them, their home, their blood‚Ä¶ Montgomery has also said PEXU is interested in looking into whatever Theodor Cazamoth has been doing‚Ä¶ because that black ichor we found on many of those bastards that tried to gut Isaac, Zeus, and I? They match samples recovered from a facility found on the east coast, one that 4th Special Forces Group touched down at a few years ago‚Ä¶. The same substance I encountered while I was defending Cazamoth‚Äôs estate.

It‚Äôs not over, we‚Äôll be back.

This is November-1, Isaac, and Zeus, signing off.",2,1736561633.0,scaryjujuarmy,1,1.0,False
1hylkda,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooseBumps/comments/1hylkda/say_cheese_and_die_is_totally_overrated/,Say cheese and die is totally overrated,"So first thing I was a huge fan of goosebumps as a kid. I decided to read them again and while being a little disappointed at how they're not really ennjoyable as an adult I still like how perfect they were for 9 years old me, and while of course not being really deep, I find a lot of plot to have sense in their simplicity
So, say cheese and die. I remember hunting for this book as a child as it had maybe the coolest and scaries cover ever, and remember also that reading it wasn't as good.
I read it again and man, I found it to be so non sense even for a children book! I hated all the characters (My god Bird I would have taken so many picture of you until I see one in which you are a skeleton) but the thing that I hated the most is that the story is totally dumb driven. We have a good idea, a camera that causes bad things to happen (I like how people still ask if it predict or cause, yeah I am sure that that little kid was destined to disappear suddenly and reappear from the void). But the camera is... Not really that evil by herself! It doesn't take pictures on herself and it doesn't really haunt the kids, who could simply not use it. Ok with the first photo, who could have guessed. Ok with the second one it makes sense to test it. Not really ok with the third, ok you want to test it but man, why you point that at your brother after you saw the picture of your new car destroyed? After that you decide to take it with you at your friend's match. And from here things get totally non sense: shari threaten you to make you eat the camera if you photograph her and she's still not sure if it's wicked. After that your friend almost died in front of you and your friend's father went to the hospital because of the camera. And what you do next, after having the confirmation that the camera is really evil? You start crying about bringing the evil camera to your party so that you can make photos! And what that incel greg does while still mourning for causing his father almost death? He brings the camera and shoot photos of his friend!

The only possible danger was actually the possibly evil man hunting him, but fact is that he wanted to take back something that he wanted to give him back (they could ideally have had a cup of coffee together to sign the deal), 
They could have shown greg trying to destroy the camera and not succeding, and make the camera able to autoclick to justify the insane number of photos that were taken in the book. No, we're stupid and bored kids let's bring the evil camera to a party and see if someone dies. I'm going to pass over other things which are stupid but are typical of the books and acceptable for kids stories. But I can see that there's a big difference between a fucking living dummy that wants to kill you, a haunted house with ghosts, a green goo that keep on grow and you don't know how to stop, and a fucking camera that you know is evil, you're scared of, don't have any psychological interest or attraction towards it, caused your father almost to die, but for some reason you can't stop using it cause you're a spineless little incel who loves a girl who's attracted to your older brother.

Ok someone dies in the end, and that's cool. But I literally think that this book required an even younger age than my (at the time of first read) 9 years.",0,1736561618.0,GooseBumps,3,0.43,False

1hylk5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1hylk5u/musttry_spa_treatments_for_relaxation_and/,Must-Try Spa Treatments for Relaxation and Rejuvenation,"Taking time for yourself to relax and rejuvenate is essential in today‚Äôs fast-paced world. Spa treatments offer the perfect escape from the stresses of daily life, allowing you to refresh your body, mind, and spirit. Whether you're a seasoned spa enthusiast or considering your first treatment, exploring different options can elevate your self-care routine. Here are some must-try spa treatments to enhance your relaxation journey.

# 1. Swedish Massage

Swedish massage is one of the most popular and widely practiced types of massage therapy. This treatment focuses on relaxing the entire body using gentle, long strokes, kneading, and circular movements on the top layers of muscles. It‚Äôs ideal for relieving stress and tension, improving circulation, and promoting overall relaxation. If you're new to massage therapy, Swedish massage is a perfect starting point.

# 2. Deep Tissue Massage

For those seeking relief from chronic pain or tight muscles, a deep tissue massage is a must. This technique applies firm pressure to the deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue, targeting specific areas of tension. It‚Äôs particularly beneficial for athletes, individuals recovering from injuries, or anyone experiencing persistent stiffness. While it may feel intense at times, the long-term benefits are well worth it.

# 3. Hot Stone Therapy

Hot stone therapy combines the benefits of massage with the soothing power of heat. Smooth, heated stones are placed on key points of the body to relax tense muscles and improve energy flow. The warmth of the stones not only enhances relaxation but also helps relieve pain and improve circulation. This treatment is perfect for unwinding after a long week or indulging in some much-needed pampering.

# 4. Aromatherapy Massage

Incorporating essential oils into a massage session can significantly enhance the experience. Aromatherapy massage uses the healing properties of oils such as lavender, eucalyptus, or chamomile to promote relaxation, reduce stress, and uplift your mood. This treatment stimulates both your body and senses, making it an excellent choice for holistic rejuvenation.

# 5. Body Scrubs and Wraps

Exfoliation is a vital step in maintaining healthy, glowing skin, and body scrubs do just that. Made with ingredients like sugar, salt, or coffee grounds, scrubs gently remove dead skin cells and improve circulation. Following the scrub, body wraps infused with hydrating or detoxifying ingredients can nourish your skin and leave you feeling refreshed from head to toe.

# 6. Facial Treatments

Your face deserves just as much attention as the rest of your body. Facials tailored to your skin type can cleanse, exfoliate, and hydrate, leaving your complexion radiant and rejuvenated. Many facials include soothing massages for the face and scalp, ensuring total relaxation.

# 7. Reflexology

Reflexology is a unique treatment that involves applying pressure to specific points on the feet, hands, or ears. These points are believed to correspond to various organs and systems in the body, promoting overall wellness and balance. Reflexology can alleviate stress, improve circulation, and boost your energy levels.

# 8. Hydrotherapy

Water-based treatments like hydrotherapy baths or Vichy showers are an excellent way to relax and detoxify. Warm water helps ease muscle tension and improve circulation, while therapeutic jets gently massage your body. Hydrotherapy is both calming and invigorating, making it a favorite among spa enthusiasts.

# 9. Couples‚Äô Spa Treatments

Sharing a spa experience with a partner or friend can deepen your bond while you both unwind. Couples‚Äô treatments, such as massages or side-by-side facials, allow you to relax together in a serene environment. It‚Äôs a perfect way to celebrate a special occasion or simply spend quality time with a loved one.

# 10. Thai Massage

Thai massage is a more active form of therapy that involves stretching and acupressure techniques. Often described as ‚Äúyoga massage,‚Äù this treatment enhances flexibility, relieves tension, and boosts energy levels. Thai massage is ideal for those seeking a dynamic and revitalizing experience.

Incorporating these treatments into your wellness routine can transform your approach to self-care, leaving you feeling renewed and invigorated. Whether you‚Äôre looking to unwind, relieve pain, or enhance your overall well-being, there‚Äôs a spa treatment perfectly suited to your needs.

1hylk2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1hylk2g/an_occult_hunters_deathlog_part_7/,An Occult Hunter's Deathlog [Part 7],"Alright, we‚Äôre back. Well, not fully. Sort of-....

I‚Äôll explain.

It‚Äôs been a minute since the end of our mission to the Navajo Nation. Truth be told, opening the car door to my driveway has never felt more tranquil‚Ä¶ That was until I heard the passenger door swing open and I could hear every single vertebrae in Isaac‚Äôs back realign as he stretched. ‚ÄúAh, home-sweet-ranch-compound, huh Dwight?‚Äù. Yes for the foreseeable future, noting our long absence from each other and his seeming inability to recall the last better part of a decade, I‚Äôve elected Isaac can shack up at my place. Zeus has seemingly taking a liking to him, although truth be told that 90lb canine assault missile will take to just about anyone that will feed him.

Sorry back on track, we were looking at several weeks of downtime, which despite the fact that I should have been focused on recuperation‚Ä¶ I could only think of piecing together what‚Äôs been happening. It‚Äôs a flaw of mine, once I‚Äôm hooked I have to see something through to the end‚Ä¶ I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm the maniac who didn‚Äôt run from the Cazamoth Estate and went to Afghanistan four separate times. Regardless we had some noncombat objective‚Ä¶ or so it seemed.

‚ÄúHey Dwight, you like decorating your house with hand prints?‚Äù Isaac quipped, my mind immediately thought back to the print indent I saw on the gutter and porch post. ‚ÄúYeah, don‚Äôt mind them, I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a thing‚Äù I said as I dragged my gear bag out of my trunk. Then something he said made the hair on the back of my neck stand up: ‚Äú... All of them?‚Äù. What did he mean ‚Äúall‚Äù of them? Well, I found out what he meant when I turned and‚Ä¶ on the wooden railing, the steps, doorway, at multiple points on the glass were more hand prints. Coating the front of the house‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd been gone for a few weeks, but this was new, this hadn‚Äôt happened before. I dropped my gear on the porch and looked at some of them, they were embedded just a few millimeters into the wood, the glass, even the stone‚Ä¶ just enough to be noticeable. All of them were human like, four fingers and a thumb, but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. They were cave painting is, archaic, weird‚Ä¶ enigmatic.

Just like the traps that were warped and bent impossibly. Just like the hundred dead birds that passed inexplicably. ‚Ä¶ This was another probe.

The only thing greeting us besides the wind and Zeus‚Äô sniffing and growling at some of the prints was the silence, all eyes were on us‚Ä¶ That was until Isaac broke the air with an all too giddy: ‚ÄúDo you have a craving for property that‚Äôs got demonic intent or is this all just happenstance?‚Äù. Guess I‚Äôm just lucky.

Truth be told, getting used to Isaac again wasn‚Äôt too much of a challenge, to be honest between him and Zeus, having people around this place again was much better than absolute solitude. Though we had our fair share of weird moments, Zeus seems to be sticking to the area immediately around the house when he trots outside, there‚Äôs an eerie feeling I‚Äôve been getting everytime I take my ATV out and scout the lands. Isaac‚Äôs been telling me the ‚Äúwalls are talking‚Äù, though that may just be the alcohol. Like, a serious amount of alcohol, we‚Äôre out in an isolated part near the rockies, where does he get that much- nevermind, rambling again, just like old times. The knocking‚Ä¶ did I tell you guys about the knocking? Well, there‚Äôs knocking everytime I go to get the coffee. Sometimes its at a window, a wall, other times from the door, one day Isaac went to go confront it but I just told him: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt answer it‚Äù.

There‚Äôs some things in this world you just don‚Äôt mess with, and I‚Äôve got some hella‚Äô spiritual blood on my hands. It will always probably be ‚Äúweird‚Äù for the rest of my life, but I guess that‚Äôs just the parameters‚Ä¶ the hand I‚Äôve been dealt. Things were starting to get worse though‚Ä¶ coyotes started to show up dead. Now it‚Äôs not unusual for Zeus to embrace his canine apex predator instincts and chase them down, then drag them back to the house to enjoy his kill right where everyone including the mailman could see it. What was unusual was for a whole pack of them to be left right at the bottom of the front steps, gutted brutally to where they were all peeled and ripped open, their blood and innards painting the front of the damn house.

I remember nearly stepping in when we went to go check, door slowly opened as I kept my glock to my right, Isaac had elected to creep out a shotgun and scan the front. ‚ÄúOkay, yeah, this place is definitely screwed, you ever think about relocating?‚Äù he remarked. Even if I wanted to, I don‚Äôt think this is something you can run from‚Ä¶ I remember Zeus sniffing at the pile, only to back off and growl at it with his ears back refusing to eat any of it. We went to my office on the second floor where I had the entire property‚Äôs motion sensors, cameras, and surveillance set up‚Ä¶ it happened last night, although no motion sensors triggered it. We found the point of appearance and‚Ä¶ well.

2:17am; the porch is clear and everything is fine, night vision on my cameras gives us damn near a 360 view of the property and every inch of it from where the pavement turns to gravel, and then to grass. Then‚Ä¶ it all appeared instantaneously: the dead coyotes, the blood to the point where some of the lenses were even smeared, all of it. Isaac and I zoomed in on the exact millisecond, opening maybe there was some cut off or something to show what happened‚Ä¶. Nothing. .01: it‚Äôs not there, .02, all of it. Whatever did this, didn‚Äôt do it through conventional means.

‚ÄúWhat do you think it could mean?‚Äù Isaac asked, flipping through all of the cameras showing every angle of the carnage. I‚Äôll tell you what I told him‚Ä¶ something was sending a message, in the same way bodies are strung up at the front of bridges to ward off enemies this was the same thing. Isaac had a different theory, he pointed to an image of the pile: ‚ÄúThe blood is one thing, but the bodies? They seem to be in the form of an‚Ä¶ offering‚Äù.

I was dumbfounded and my face probably showed my confusion: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù. My Idaho alcoholic went on to explain: ‚ÄúThink about it‚Ä¶ This is a crossroads, right, you got the Dakotas to our northish, west is red rock territory, south is Texas and Oklahoma, this is a merging area of all kinds of nasty shit, that‚Äôs why so many different things happen‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve seen uglies leave carcasses and stuff out as a warning, this‚Ä¶ the way they‚Äôre like, placed all together like a meat wicker basket. Seems like they were presenting it to you. Gotta remember, things don‚Äôt work like people do‚Äù. If this is the way things worked, then it could happen on the opposite: just as something could show you respect, something else could target you.

We kept moving though; carcasses went in the trash and I took a power washer to the front of the house, and after some replacing of tiles, wood, the majority of the handprints were gone. I was tired of running and I wasn‚Äôt about to let anything scare or force me off this land, well, force ‚Äúus‚Äù now I guess as this isn‚Äôt a one man circus anymore.

Likewise there‚Äôs been developments on the grander scale, more specifically the shadow war PEXU is embroiled in against our adversaries. You ever wonder who leads the Blackwood Brotherhood? It‚Äôs a question that‚Äôs been raised by many, while the New Advent has Ryan Evans we all know that man‚Äôs nothing more than a gray skinned puppet with darkness behind his wide toothy smile. After he appeared at that meeting where he addressed the world flanked by politicians from north and South America, Europe, leading figures in economics and big tech‚Ä¶ an investigation was launched by the CIA‚Äôs Special Collection Service to track when this huge shift in momentum for them happened. They sorted through tens of thousands of emails, phone calls, texts, and found almost nothing relating to the New Advent at all.

Then‚Ä¶ a singular message shared on an encrypted messaging app by some lower level informant shells connected to our adversaries sent everyone into a panic. ‚ÄúBelial‚Äù; in Hebrew it means the Devil, in the context they found it in it reignited a manhunt that had gone cold nearly 32 years ago. Believed to be the victim of a death camp in the middle east, he was being tracked by Israeli intelligence for quite some time after a special mission unit they sent to capture him all turned up dead. No wound, blemishes, nothing, just cold and unalive. After that he fell off the grid and ever since they it‚Äôs been nothing but theories connecting him to the primordial death cult we currently face: cells found in Denmark, Great Britain talked about an Augur from Damascus instructing them to revive the PARAFOR leading to shit we are still fighting to this day. Every connection from groups or training groups we get stops, no names, no ranks‚Ä¶ just the tale of a man with dark red skin, sunken eyes and a bright white smile. His lips supposedly gone from acid burns that also line his body. Yet‚Ä¶ it was all conjecture, drawings in scribbles of mad men who died when they allowed ancient shit to crawl out of their bodies like molted animals.

Until one single message: *‚ÄúBelial will lead the way‚Äù.*

Then it all hit the fan: two operatives PEXU had with us, one from the agency and the other homeland security were found dead outside of a site that doesn‚Äôt exist on any manifest in the United States internal security directorate. No documentation exists because all of it‚Äôs funding is from black budget. The recovery teams assigned to retrieve them became casualties themselves as whoever left them there carved glyphs into their eyes‚Ä¶ the same one the Blackwood uses for indoctrination. Shortly after? Deep in the Amazon ABIN, Brazil‚Äôs premiere intelligence network, was searching for a facility hidden in the rainforest connected to the cult. Attached to them were some members of the Special Activities Division‚Ä¶ almost all of them didn‚Äôt make it out alive, half of them were grievously injured. A completely compartmentalized operation was compromised and ambushed‚Ä¶ worst yet was the place they were hunting for disappeared. Every piece of metal, everything from the satellite photos was gone, like it never existed.

2 steps forward, 3 back into the woodchipper.

I won‚Äôt lie, my security office has turned into that of a makeshift war room with pelican cases and tough boxes lining the walls, a rack securing my armament, and a cork board of all I‚Äôve learned complete with red string. The noose was tightening around our neck, 2 intelligence agencies experiencing major breaches, vew few within he FBI can be trusted and even MI6 needs to work in the shadows. Everyone from megachurches to corner stores is starting to wear those golden bands, and no one seems to be noticing. Not a peep or a whisper, anyone who does goes missing‚Ä¶ 110,000\~ a year and counting, if even a tenth of that has been turned into vessels for ascension then we are neck deep in enemies. Honestly staring too deeply into it all laid out like that makes me nearly go mad sometimes, sitting back in an armory knowing that just weeks ago we fought through hell just to get ourselves an inch of breathing room.

‚ÄúOh lord, don‚Äôt tell me, you‚Äôre going insane aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Isaac‚Äôs voice managed to draw me out of it with an eye roll as he walked in and took an eye at the board: ‚ÄúHey Dwight, if you are succumbing to whatever MKUltra stuff they pumped into your veins, give me a heads up so I can get out of the blast zone alright?‚Äù. We seemed to stare at each other for a good long while as he took a step closer to he, chuckling ‚ÄúAh! I‚Äôm just messing with yah, but for real, did they‚Ä¶ put anything in your coffee? I mean you never drank coffee last time I‚Äôd seen you so I‚Äôm wondering if you‚Äôre the real Dwight‚Ä¶-‚Äù.

Isaac somehow manages to say so much and yet nothing at the same time. He leaned back against the wall next to it, crossing his arms ‚ÄúSo, what now?‚Äù. I shrugged, I leaned back and grabbed my coffee that was sitting atop a palette of ammo cans ‚ÄúWe wait until we hear more‚Äù.

‚ÄúOh come on! There‚Äôs gotta be something we can do, call up that Hogwarts fellow of your, Montana-‚Äù.

‚ÄúMontgomery‚Äù I corrected him.

‚ÄúYeah sure, we can still do something, get back out there, hop in our supe-d up mystery machine and take it to ‚Äòem!‚Äù he said emphatically, pumping his fist in the air. A supe-d up mystery that had the transmission blown to hell ever since I had to floor it over a sasquatch back in the Dakotas‚Ä¶ more on that later.

‚ÄúIsaac, we‚Äôre part of an organization‚Ä¶ well, me, but-‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am too?!‚Äù Isaac said, I pinched the bridge of my nose realizing my mistake. ‚ÄúNo, I am, you are unofficially by association‚Äù. ‚ÄúStill, how‚Äôs the pay?‚Äù. ‚ÄúTerrible‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe benefits?‚Äù. ‚ÄúWorse‚Äù. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the incentive?‚Äù he asked, raising an eyebrow.  
‚ÄúDuty‚Äù. ‚ÄúOh god you guys really are insane‚Äù.

You think? Mortals using the modern day‚Äôs best armaments to cut through the hordes of wherever-the-hell to send whatever-the-hell back to where it was summoned from by other mortals. I‚Äôve seen more of our people succumb to injuries that can‚Äôt be determined by our laws of universe than slashes and guttings, yet I still clock in. There‚Äôs definitely something wrong with me.

‚ÄúI guess that gives us some time to think‚Ä¶ or well, remember‚Äù Isaac said, rubbing his head. It was no secret his lack of memory was weighing on him, he does a good job putting up a front. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had no contact with anyone? Haven‚Äôt been back there in?‚Ä¶‚Äù I asked, his eyes snapped to me ‚ÄúToo long‚Ä¶‚Äù. We had ourselves, the cult, but then there was Theodore Cazamoth, my old boss who was obsessed with seeing how he could industrialize the primordial to advance humanity. ‚ÄúAdvancement‚Äù that 4th Special Forces Group encountered on more than one occasion and lost more than a few of their own. We had been so dug in fighting a subversive apocalypse, what the hell was Theodore able to do the last 6 years?

We were going to have to find out‚Ä¶ later. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hitting the hay, let me know if some demon tries to tear our hearts out in the middle of the night, yeah?‚Äù Isaac said heading for the door. ‚ÄúWilco, if you get the chance before me, dump my body down a flight of stairs‚Äù I joked. Isaac stopped at the door as he looked around, then back to me ‚ÄúHey Dwight‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre back‚Äù. The sincerity in his words seemed to sober me up, the same feeling that drew me back to this years ago‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why I keep marching on. Not insanity or money, duty‚Ä¶ someone had to make the shit in the dark afraid, someone had to go in there and get vengeance for the grieving spouse, the crying child, the mourning parent, or those who went alone with no one to remember their name. I did‚Ä¶ every single person I have gotten some pound of justice for.

I woke up later around witching hour to grab a water. Zeus stayed in bed as I headed downstairs with iron in my pocket just in case someone wanted to try. I rounded the bannister as I reached the bottom of my stairs, my front door just ahead of them as the entire living room was laid out with a couch, chimney, table and all‚Ä¶ I stopped as my eyes snapped to the chair in the corner. I drew my pistol and tried to hit the light, nothing‚Ä¶ my finger felt the rail underneath where it should have been. A light then shined on me causing me to squint my eyes, it aimed down as my eyes adjusted‚Ä¶ it was my taclight.

‚ÄúYou rely on your equipment too much, Dwight Nolan‚Äù the figure sitting in the chair said, that of an impoverished male‚Äôs voice. The moonlight just barely missed them as shadows cloaked them, they tossed the taclight to me causing it to bounce across the floor. With my pistol still aimed I reached down and placed it back on and got a good lock at them. In a dark suit and dress shoes was a bald man, gray skin with dozens of stitches of different sutures lined their head. A black set of shades hid their eyes as on their lap they held what looked to be a chalkboard.

*‚ÄúDwight Anthony Nolan. 39 years old. Son, Leader, Killer‚Ä¶‚Äù.*

Tally marks were underneath, hundreds of tally marks‚Ä¶ each one of them dark red, whispering to me. I knew what they meant‚Ä¶ a name, an age, a birth and death date. Some were the things I had been ordered to cut down, target packages filled in the dozens‚Ä¶ over a hundred. I looked to them, then back to the man; ‚ÄúWho the fuck are you?‚Äù.

‚ÄúA watcher, numbers keeper mostly‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou got some sort of point in doing this? I‚Äôve got half a mind to-‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a lot of blood on your hands‚Äù the stitched up freak said accusingly. ‚ÄúWhat? Sad I put down your friends? Or something in the woods, or the swamp, or across the ocean. I‚Äôm not gonna apologize‚Äù I growled, my finger well on the trigger as I started to apply force. ‚ÄúWhat about them?‚Äù it said staring blankly at me, pointing to another tally mark‚Ä¶ Alyssa, Age 23, born in the Navajo Nation, died because we weren‚Äôt fast enough to reach her house to tell her to get to safety. It‚Äôs hand pointed to another‚Ä¶ These weren‚Äôt just kills, these were people I had failed to save. Sometimes it was because I had a wrong lead, other times I was just too slow, some there was nothing I could do‚Ä¶ but it was on my soul.

‚ÄúProtectors have continued to form a membrane of annoyance for thousands of years, Dwight Nolan. We are closer than ever to shifting the momentum back to the era where you hid in the caves protected by a campfire and a stick‚Äù It said with glee in it‚Äôs voice. It was well aware of the pressure going on around the world, it knew that I knew as well‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt give it an inch. ‚ÄúWell you won‚Äôt be there to see it‚Äù I said, pulling the trigger‚Ä¶ the gun didn‚Äôt fire. I raised an eyebrow as suddenly I could hear pounding on the door that made my heart shoot straight into my throat.

‚ÄúNo, Dwight Nolan, you won‚Äôt. You didn‚Äôt really think hiding in the rockies would save you, would it?‚Äù my light went out‚Ä¶ and I woke up in bed. That being said, I woke up to a chorus of alerts coming from the speaker on my night stand; \[‚ÄúMultiple intrusions detected‚Ä¶ multiple intrusions detected‚Ä¶. Condition Alamo, Condition Alamo, Condition, Alamo‚Äù\].

Something had followed us home.

Dossier: Condition Alamo Alamo‚Ä¶ in every military there‚Äôs a contingency when deployed for whenever the wire is breached and the enemy has entered. The Poles I worked with liked to use the term Red, a Brit unit I worked with preferred Direct Fire Charlie. I‚Äôve always stuck with one I‚Äôve encountered at a number of American Fobs: Alamo.

Zeus was barking a storm as I could hear banging coming from the front door downstairs, for reference I bought a steel lined reinforced door with heavy duty hinges and several locks. That being said I had also gotten into scraps with things that cut through material tougher than it with no issues. I had minutes at most‚Ä¶ I scrambled out of bed to find my pistol on my nightstand, drawing it and scanning around. Zeus was standing on the bed growling‚Ä¶ the banging had stopped as I looked‚Ä¶ no moonlight just like there had been hours ago.

I approached the curtains and peeked just under the edge to see, only to find an eye staring back. It was completely white, the iris gone with a pinprick needle for a pupil‚Ä¶ my blood ran cold, I remember that kind of eye. I stumbled back and aimed my boomstick but only darkness remained. Then‚Ä¶ laughter, dozens of different cackles, jeers, echoed from the outside‚Ä¶ this wasn‚Äôt right, this‚Ä¶ I had been here before, I had encountered something exactly like this‚Ä¶ back when I was just a security guard hired to protect that fuckin‚Äô forest estate.

Fuck this, we need to kit up quick. I opened the my door and shined my pistol light around, clear left and right, a few doors ahead of me were the bathroom and a study, directly to my right was the armory. I took a step out, watching the stairs down to my left‚Ä¶ only to be deafened when a gunshot rang out to my right‚Ä¶ The round barely missed me as it hit the doorway of the bathroom just in front of me, the snap and wood shavings from it showering the area as I ducked down and gripped my ear, aiming my boomstick, it was Isaac‚Ä¶ who immediately waved his hands.

‚ÄúAh hell!! Sorry!!!‚Äù. ‚ÄúIsaac what the fuck?!‚Äù I exclaimed, though I could also barely hear him as he walked over and shouted. I nursed my ear as he asked ‚ÄúHello!? You hearing me?!‚Äù.

‚ÄúNo, you deafened me!! The hell did you say?!‚Äù I asked, his answer sent a chill up my spine: ‚ÄúLook I had already seen you just before the house started to scream at us, and you nearly bit my fuckin‚Äô head off!!‚Äù. Seen me? I stood up as I scanned around ‚ÄúIsaac what the hell are you talking about?‚Äù.

‚ÄúI woke up just before the alarms started to go off, you were creeping over my bed and I was getting a bad vibe‚Ä¶ then you tried to leap on me, and I grabbed this and started to fire into you-‚Äù he said showing the Glock 19 I had given him as a bedside carry. This was odd because that was sure to have woken me up. I looked to him, my ears still pounding ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ where did‚Ä¶ I go?‚Äù I asked. A crash from downstairs caused both of us to turn and aim at the stairwell down,, Zeus had crept into the hall and began to growl at it. I reached over and pulled him by his collar ‚ÄúIsaac‚Ä¶ into the safe room, now‚Äù.

All three of us got into that armory as Isaac locked the door, I took to the desk connected to the security system as Isaac went to work preparing himself some firepower. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?!‚Äù he asked and frankly I was asking the same thing. I pulled up the grid to my property‚Ä¶ out of the several dozen motion detectors and trail cams I had set up, over 60% of them were offline, the rest were in states of damage, flickering, and only a few worked‚Ä¶ one of which was one adjacent to my driveway. A single pinprick eye looked through the tall glass, then before I could even register it‚Ä¶ a flash of silver, blackened nails on a bloated dead hand pried the camera‚Äôs steel and concrete embedded post out of the ground and smashed the unit.

That skin‚Ä¶ that hand.

I switched between the cameras, so many of them were out of commission. Some were smashed and nearly tore off their mounts, others just flashed LED colors with fragments of their vision still intact. The driveway ones were already taken out, the one on the front of the house was completely offline, something had already invaded the property and taken out our eyes‚Ä¶ not only that, but it knew where to look. I saw the notification for sound being registered, I got some crackles, static, like I expected‚Ä¶ but then, cackles‚Ä¶ deep, warped cackles of what sounded like a dozen people forced into one.

I had‚Ä¶ stopped this, I thought I did.

Then, just as I did one more run back through all of the cameras‚Ä¶ unit 21, mounted near the peak of the back of the house, highest up‚Ä¶ registered a voice. It came through calm, almost a whisper, but like some sort of predator that caught it‚Äôs prey it called out: ‚ÄúNolan‚Ä¶.‚Äù. A sudden thrash as something monstrous running across the roof shook the whole damn house, caused me to almost lose balance as I held onto the house.

‚ÄúWhat-in-the-bayou-fuck is going on?!‚Äù Isaac said, looking over my shoulder. I looked back to see he had gotten himself 2 bandoliers of shotgun shells, including a belt‚Ä¶ while in his tank top and shorts. Zeus was barking, as the sound of something crawling around the outside caught his attention. Then‚Ä¶ the movement on the roof stopped, towards the center; wet tearing and ripping, flesh and tendons, I know that sound anywhere, echoed‚Ä¶ as thuds sounded on the roof. I switched off the cameras and made for my equipment table, prepping my rifle as I pulled my belt and plate carrier on.

‚ÄúIs that shit sounding like what I think it‚Äôs sounding?‚Äù Isaac asked, aiming his shotgun around at whatever the hell was deciding to demonically touch every ceiling tile out there. He was feeling the familiar feeling too, this rhymed all too closely to whatever the hell was at the Cazamoth estate. ‚ÄúThose intelligence leaks‚Äù I pointed out, ‚ÄúYou think they found us as well?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI think something found us‚Ä¶‚Äù; I tried to key into my radio; \[‚ÄúMain this is November-1‚Ä¶‚Äù\].

Nothing, I tried again: \[‚ÄúNovember-1 to Main, serious situation, I need support‚Ä¶.‚Äù\]. Still nothing, dead silent, I looked back to him ‚ÄúEither our comms are cut, or our friends are preoccupied‚Äù.

Front outside towards the front, a thunderous roar sounded followed by what I knew damn sure was my front door being forced off his hinges and the snap of my bannister soon after. Isaac snapped towards the door with his shotgun as I pulled down my night vision, my rifle‚Äôs laser trained on the door as well. ‚ÄúSo? What‚Äôs the plan? Sit tight and wait for help?‚Äù Isaac asked.

‚ÄúHelp ain‚Äôt coming Isaac, and by the time we even get a word out for help these things will be right ontop of us‚Äù I said, the sounds growing louder. The barrel of his shotgun dipped every slightly ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what do we do?‚Äù.

Simple: ‚Äú-We get the hell off my lawn‚Äù.

Zeus began to bark as a set of footsteps raced up the stairs and towards the door could be heard, the sound of a woman‚Äôs full lung scream growing louder. It began to slam on the door again, and again, finally it gave way and she stumbled in. In some tattered gown barely covering her dead skin soaked in what looked like tar. Her arms were bisected longways as she clawed at the floor more insect than human, through her long hair she looked to us, her face peeking through as whatever was coating her at through it‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how she was even screaming, just a gap in her skull where her face was. She roared again; ‚ÄúAh Jesus hell!!!!‚Äù Isaac yelled as he blasted her in the chest with his shotgun. The scatter blast tore through her hip and momentarily stopped her, however she used her multiple limbs to launch right at us‚Ä¶

I responded with a group of shots, tearing through her torso, she fell onto the large wooden ready table I had in the center sending ammo cans of rounds tumbling off, and tools flying. Zeus barked snapping his jaws at her from the ground, she stood up and Isaac got one hell of a good shot at her shoulder.

She went flying back against the wall, Zeus grabbing onto her leg and beginning to kill shake it out of her socket. I joined and fired several rounds, the snap of my suppressor echoing as they impacted her brainstem. That corrosive shit splattered all along the wall as she grew still. Zeus seemed to back off, he could tell from the smell that none of that was good. A moment of still occurred and I closed the distance, I used the tip of my suppressor to move her head to the side as that shit fell onto the floor. I watched it impact the floorboards‚Ä¶ the black ichor seemed to‚Ä¶ move. My mind thought back to the plastic baggie of shit I had encountered, between the coloration, the eyes, the laughs‚Ä¶ the substance.

‚ÄúThis is from the Cazamoth Estate-‚Äù I stated my theory as I knelt down next to the corpse. ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt no way though, I read your entire memoir on that, you killed those freaks‚Äù Isaac said, scanning around with his Mossberg not wanting to even think of the theory. ‚Äú-Then tell me, Isaac, what the hell are they filled with the exact same shit from south Missouri?‚Äù I barked back. Our debate was cut short as a rumbling could be heard, inside of the walls. We could hear every single shuffle, and pained movement as it closed in on the vent‚Ä¶ it fuckin‚Äô popped off, a set of bloated dead arms, skin that cut itself on the metal edges and spewed puss, reached through as they aggressively tried to force themselves through. Two slimy heads, eyes sunken in dark rings, pin prick eyes and brown toothy smiles were attempting to force themselves through, to the point the wall around the vent opening contorted and bent. ‚ÄúIsaac!!! Nolan!!! Isaac!!! Nolan!!!‚Äù their voices sung with each other as they screamed. There was something about their aggression, their hatred I could feel through their forced smiles that was just shocking, making you feel like prey. I didn‚Äôt say a word, I fired my rifle, tearing through their skin, Isaac let loose with his shotgun.

The resulting blast of buckshot tore through the vent, showering the trio in pellets and broken metal, as the floor and wall around was torn up, all that remained was a pile of mess that was once human. I turned towards him ‚ÄúStill skeptical now?‚Äù. Isaac steadied himself the best he could, his stock in his armpit as he sheepishly dug‚Ä¶ oh for fucksakes, he dug a flask out of his shorts and tool a long sip; ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm right here with you‚Äù.

‚ÄúFor fucksakes, Isaac‚Ä¶‚Äù I shook my head, he looked ‚ÄúWhat?! They‚Äôre invading, I‚Äôm standing our ground!!!‚Äù.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say redecorate my entire fuckin‚Äô house with double ought buck while you‚Äôre plaster out your-‚Äù our argument was cut short as the sounds of more of them from the stairwell could be heard. ‚ÄúHow about this: We clear this place of ghouls, and I‚Äôll fund the reconstruction‚Äù Isaac quipped. With what money, Isaac? you sleep on my couch‚Ä¶ or well, figuratively, or he‚Äôd be down there getting possessed and quartered by the neighborhood brigade right now. ‚ÄúWe beat them before, we can do it again, let‚Äôs go‚Äù I asserted to him, he nodded and followed.

My laser scanned as we pushed into the hallway, Isaac cleared right as I pushed forward towards the stairs, he joined me as Zeus was at our feet sniffing ahead. I was on the left side of the hall, my laser aimed down the stairs, I could see the remnants of the door hinges torn clean off‚Ä¶ they were rated for 3,500lbs of incoming force, whatever came through here did so with a vengeance.

We pushed down the stairs, my barrel leading the way and centered on the wide open front door as Isaac watched our flank. As I reached the ground floor, I shuffled right and pied around the opening, I could hear them running throughout the tall grass, laughing, whispering, eyes peeking out and then ducking back with speeds too quick for their hulking forms. all peeking through as they could see me better than my dual tubes could. Then from the tall grass, one of them bolted out. ‚ÄúIncoming!!!‚Äù I yelled, heading over to the doorway I fired as the gray mass closed the distance across my front area onto the porch. I fired rounds that cut through it‚Äôs back, lodged right in it‚Äôs body, black splashes filled the are and yet it still kept it‚Äôs momentum.

‚ÄúMove!!-‚Äù.

That‚Äôs all I could get out as Isaac ducked right, Zeus barked as the thing charged and knocked me clean off my ass through the air and into my couch. It didn‚Äôt seem to care how many rounds I fired into it, I rolled off and groggily got a good lock. Its still human torso was the cross roads for a horrifying monstrosity where dog-like legs met an army that was that of a centipede, but the chitin was made out of calcified black flesh. The other one was seemingly made of glass and had gaps between bones, the head was fighting between several different mouths, gray and sunken into it‚Äôs torso‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs sunken pin prick eyes centered on me

Whatever the hell happened to it, it decided to turn their soul into some sort of skin split thing. It‚Äôs voice was that of dozens, roars, yells, and yet it semi coherently all said: ‚ÄúNolan‚Äù.

I tried to back up as it reached down, the centipede arm gnawing at my plate carrier, tearing through the nylon cordura as I fired into it‚Äôs torso sending chunks of flesh and bone flying out the back. Zeus lept on top zinking his teeth into it‚Äôs neck causing it to yell what sounded like a cross between a tiger and a ma. Isaac planted his shotgun right on the skull, the shot caused the entire thing to explode out which completely showered me‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt know what was worse: being covered in dead person or dead rotten beast.

I forced my buttstock into the ground, my head still rolling around as Isaac took point and looked to me: ‚ÄúHow you feeling? You got knocked a country mile‚Äù.

I felt the base of my neck that still felt like it was on fire: ‚ÄúBeen worse, landed right on my neck. ‚ÄúQuick, how many fingers am I holding up?‚Äù. ‚ÄúIsaac you‚Äôre not holding up any‚Äù. ‚ÄúSee? You‚Äôre good‚Äù.

From the doorway to the kitchen, a set of elongated arms connected to a body that was stretched and contorted beyond human proportions. It stepped in bow legged, its face‚Ä¶ a human skull that had been buried and pushed into the collar bone area sat below a smooth, angler fish like top portion. Two sets of jaws forced together, formed some horrifying maw that just hurt to look at,  like knives being dragged down my bare bones. We quickly fired on it, it grabbed onto the ground around it and spat at us‚Ä¶ that same tar like shit, Isaac was quicker that I was. Some of it hit directly on the plate carrier, eating into my ATAK. The smell was‚Ä¶ awful, it began to fuck with me, I didn‚Äôt know it until well into it‚Äôs effects but soon I realized I was hallucinating.

My eyes burned, my nose doing everything it could to exorcize the feeling to no avail, the pounding noise in my head felt like screams and chants. It felt real, every gust of wind, everything was hypersensitive. I scanned around, the ground unsteady, then it lunged at me. I could feel it‚Äôs claws slashing into my skin, I screamed and fired at it although it just degloved my arms like it was nothing, I could see the veins and blood underneath as it threw me into a wall and it gave in. I stood up and I was back‚Ä¶ upstairs? The thing came charging down and I managed to clip the human skull underneath, causing it to stumble. As it did I fired, the flash of my suppressor under nods short, small, yet controlled as I tore through one of it‚Äôs legs.

It then reached out and hooked my jaw‚Ä¶. Then pulled and yanked it clean off. The feeling of my tongue flapping around, my gasps for air‚Ä¶ I dropped my rifle to it‚Äôs sking as it slashed at my face. I fell to the ground, back in the living room‚Ä¶ Zeus was now gnawing at it‚Äôs head as it reached for him.

Not. My. Fuckin. Dog. I fired an entire magazine into it, having switched to auto it tore through it‚Äôs center off mass. I then charged forward and tackled it to the ground, the armored knuckles on my gloves being buried into it‚Äôs head. It‚Äôs elongated arms tried to reach and tear through my plates, I didn‚Äôt care, hell I took off my helmet and began to pound it over, and over, with the clear side of my kevlar. The burning feeling it had on my corneas combined with a chorus of screams that just wouldn‚Äôt end, I would make it end. It‚Äôs head snapped back as it began to be crushed, soon the vortex-like swirls that formed it‚Äôs eyes began to snap back‚Ä¶ looking human, and looked‚Ä¶ like me.

Isaac threw me to the ground, I gasped as I could feel the clear air again, my vision normal as the property, the house‚Ä¶ everything was silent. Zeus was sat in the center carpet‚Ä¶ surrounded by dozens of malformed, transformed adversaries that were now spending their last seconds on this earth bleeding out. I sat up, catching my breath. I looked around‚Ä¶ the beast with the elongated arms was laying on the floor, it‚Äôs head completely pulverized‚Ä¶ my helmet embedded into it. I looked to Isaac, I‚Äôll be honest I was shaken the fuck up ‚ÄúW-What the fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah you lost your shit‚Ä¶ a bunch of them began to pour in, you were firing wildly, you started tearing them apart‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, I raised an eyebrow, I didn‚Äôt remember that and I still don‚Äôt but I looked around. There was a hole in my wall wide open into my kitchen‚Ä¶ some sort of hound like beast, skeletal with blood and muscle being it‚Äôs only exterior had it‚Äôs throat ripped out and my multitool stuck in its skull. My rifle was on the ground, bolt locked to the rear amongst several others.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear anything else‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, staggering to my feet. ‚ÄúYeah, I think we might‚Äôve gotten them all‚Ä¶‚Äù Isaac said, he paused for a moment, looking around ‚ÄúOkay, no jinxing us this time, I think they‚Äôre actually all dead‚Ä¶ or escaped‚Äù. I quickly cleared and replenished my rifle, Isaac and I secured the kitchen and basement, right around when we got primary power back on‚Ä¶ my radio crackled to life.

\[‚ÄúNovember-1, sitrep‚Ä¶‚Äù\] it was Montgomery‚Äôs voice. I looked to Isaac before hitting the push-to-talk; \[‚ÄúThis is November-1, just experienced an attack on my residence, it got kinetic‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre still alive but in a bad way‚Ä¶ how copy?‚Äù\].

A few seconds of static, some failed key-in attempts‚Ä¶ Montgomery answered \[‚ÄúRoger that‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got an organization wide attack‚Ä¶ stay put and prepare the best you can‚Äù\]. Isaac scoffed, rolling his eyes he kicked the mangled remains of something that was formerly intruding, now decomposing ‚Äúyeah, tell manchester it‚Äôs a little late for that‚Äù.

\[‚ÄúNovember-1 to Main, I‚Äôve got several dozen EKIA, I need reinforcements-‚Äù\].

What he said next planted a deep pit in my stomach: \[‚ÄúDozens of PEXU solo units have not reported back in, November-1. We‚Äôre barely able to take accountability. Hunker down the best you can and we will be coming for you‚Ä¶ Main-Out‚Äù\]. There Isaac and I stood in my house, I sighed as he slung his shotgun, looking around ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶. Nail and boards?‚Äù.

I pinched the bridge of my nose; ‚ÄúWhat are we going to just board up all the holes and sit next to the radio?‚Äù. We did, it took around 25 minutes however Isaac and I successfully and haphazardly re-secured the house. Occasionally we would hear the sound of something outside, neither of us went to look however we did keep our weapons ready, nothing would attack again. In the morning the sound of an SUV approaching after the sun rose above the horizon cautioned all three of us to approach, my suppressor and his barrel sticking out gaps in the boards.

The blacked out vic parked in my driveway, the door opened and a young man in a navy suit, slicked back hair exited. He kept his hands up, only moving one to take his sunglasses off‚Ä¶. Montgomery chuckled at the state of things before he looked at the structure: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it, you‚Äôve had a very entertaining night, November-1?‚Äù.

I drew my barrel back from the opening and peeked through ‚ÄúYou can say that‚Ä¶ how‚Äôs everyone else doing?‚Äù. The smirk on his face faded as he sighed, approaching ‚ÄúSMUs survived intact, many weren‚Äôt touched for obvious reasons‚Ä¶ others like yourself, intelligence personnel‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say we‚Äôve got less comrades than when the night started‚Äù. That‚Äôs where we are at right now; Isaac and I are still holding down the fort, surprisingly we‚Äôve gotten the actual structure resecured but let‚Äôs just say it won‚Äôt be pretty for some time. I don‚Äôt plan on leaving anytime soon‚Ä¶ this place is my home, I hid here when I wanted to step away, and I don‚Äôt plan on running off again. PEXU has taken a considerable amount of casualties, though we‚Äôve sustained it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time for us to hunker down, lick our wounds, and soon we will be counter attacking. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs not, just a little bit shot to hell right now‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll get back to it.

We‚Äôll take it to them, their home, their blood‚Ä¶ Montgomery has also said PEXU is interested in looking into whatever Theodor Cazamoth has been doing‚Ä¶ because that black ichor we found on many of those bastards that tried to gut Isaac, Zeus, and I? They match samples recovered from a facility found on the east coast, one that 4th Special Forces Group touched down at a few years ago‚Ä¶. The same substance I encountered while I was defending Cazamoth‚Äôs estate.

It‚Äôs not over, we‚Äôll be back.

I‚Äôll explain.

It‚Äôs been a minute since the end of our mission to the Navajo Nation. Truth be told, opening the car door to my driveway has never felt more tranquil‚Ä¶ That was until I heard the passenger door swing open and I could hear every single vertebrae in Isaac‚Äôs back realign as he stretched. ‚ÄúAh, home-sweet-ranch-compound, huh Dwight?‚Äù. Yes for the foreseeable future, noting our long absence from each other and his seeming inability to recall the last better part of a decade, I‚Äôve elected Isaac can shack up at my place. Zeus has seemingly taking a liking to him, although truth be told that 90lb canine assault missile will take to just about anyone that will feed him.

Sorry back on track, we were looking at several weeks of downtime, which despite the fact that I should have been focused on recuperation‚Ä¶ I could only think of piecing together what‚Äôs been happening. It‚Äôs a flaw of mine, once I‚Äôm hooked I have to see something through to the end‚Ä¶ I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm the maniac who didn‚Äôt run from the Cazamoth Estate and went to Afghanistan four separate times. Regardless we had some noncombat objective‚Ä¶ or so it seemed.

‚ÄúHey Dwight, you like decorating your house with hand prints?‚Äù Isaac quipped, my mind immediately thought back to the print indent I saw on the gutter and porch post. ‚ÄúYeah, don‚Äôt mind them, I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a thing‚Äù I said as I dragged my gear bag out of my trunk. Then something he said made the hair on the back of my neck stand up: ‚Äú... All of them?‚Äù. What did he mean ‚Äúall‚Äù of them? Well, I found out what he meant when I turned and‚Ä¶ on the wooden railing, the steps, doorway, at multiple points on the glass were more hand prints. Coating the front of the house‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd been gone for a few weeks, but this was new, this hadn‚Äôt happened before. I dropped my gear on the porch and looked at some of them, they were embedded just a few millimeters into the wood, the glass, even the stone‚Ä¶ just enough to be noticeable. All of them were human like, four fingers and a thumb, but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. They were cave painting is, archaic, weird‚Ä¶ enigmatic.

Just like the traps that were warped and bent impossibly. Just like the hundred dead birds that passed inexplicably. ‚Ä¶ This was another probe.

The only thing greeting us besides the wind and Zeus‚Äô sniffing and growling at some of the prints was the silence, all eyes were on us‚Ä¶ That was until Isaac broke the air with an all too giddy: ‚ÄúDo you have a craving for property that‚Äôs got demonic intent or is this all just happenstance?‚Äù. Guess I‚Äôm just lucky.

Truth be told, getting used to Isaac again wasn‚Äôt too much of a challenge, to be honest between him and Zeus, having people around this place again was much better than absolute solitude. Though we had our fair share of weird moments, Zeus seems to be sticking to the area immediately around the house when he trots outside, there‚Äôs an eerie feeling I‚Äôve been getting everytime I take my ATV out and scout the lands. Isaac‚Äôs been telling me the ‚Äúwalls are talking‚Äù, though that may just be the alcohol. Like, a serious amount of alcohol, we‚Äôre out in an isolated part near the rockies, where does he get that much- nevermind, rambling again, just like old times. The knocking‚Ä¶ did I tell you guys about the knocking? Well, there‚Äôs knocking everytime I go to get the coffee. Sometimes its at a window, a wall, other times from the door, one day Isaac went to go confront it but I just told him: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt answer it‚Äù.

There‚Äôs some things in this world you just don‚Äôt mess with, and I‚Äôve got some hella‚Äô spiritual blood on my hands. It will always probably be ‚Äúweird‚Äù for the rest of my life, but I guess that‚Äôs just the parameters‚Ä¶ the hand I‚Äôve been dealt. Things were starting to get worse though‚Ä¶ coyotes started to show up dead. Now it‚Äôs not unusual for Zeus to embrace his canine apex predator instincts and chase them down, then drag them back to the house to enjoy his kill right where everyone including the mailman could see it. What was unusual was for a whole pack of them to be left right at the bottom of the front steps, gutted brutally to where they were all peeled and ripped open, their blood and innards painting the front of the damn house.

I remember nearly stepping in when we went to go check, door slowly opened as I kept my glock to my right, Isaac had elected to creep out a shotgun and scan the front. ‚ÄúOkay, yeah, this place is definitely screwed, you ever think about relocating?‚Äù he remarked. Even if I wanted to, I don‚Äôt think this is something you can run from‚Ä¶ I remember Zeus sniffing at the pile, only to back off and growl at it with his ears back refusing to eat any of it. We went to my office on the second floor where I had the entire property‚Äôs motion sensors, cameras, and surveillance set up‚Ä¶ it happened last night, although no motion sensors triggered it. We found the point of appearance and‚Ä¶ well.

2:17am; the porch is clear and everything is fine, night vision on my cameras gives us damn near a 360 view of the property and every inch of it from where the pavement turns to gravel, and then to grass. Then‚Ä¶ it all appeared instantaneously: the dead coyotes, the blood to the point where some of the lenses were even smeared, all of it. Isaac and I zoomed in on the exact millisecond, opening maybe there was some cut off or something to show what happened‚Ä¶. Nothing. .01: it‚Äôs not there, .02, all of it. Whatever did this, didn‚Äôt do it through conventional means.

‚ÄúWhat do you think it could mean?‚Äù Isaac asked, flipping through all of the cameras showing every angle of the carnage. I‚Äôll tell you what I told him‚Ä¶ something was sending a message, in the same way bodies are strung up at the front of bridges to ward off enemies this was the same thing. Isaac had a different theory, he pointed to an image of the pile: ‚ÄúThe blood is one thing, but the bodies? They seem to be in the form of an‚Ä¶ offering‚Äù.

I was dumbfounded and my face probably showed my confusion: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù. My Idaho alcoholic went on to explain: ‚ÄúThink about it‚Ä¶ This is a crossroads, right, you got the Dakotas to our northish, west is red rock territory, south is Texas and Oklahoma, this is a merging area of all kinds of nasty shit, that‚Äôs why so many different things happen‚Ä¶ We‚Äôve seen uglies leave carcasses and stuff out as a warning, this‚Ä¶ the way they‚Äôre like, placed all together like a meat wicker basket. Seems like they were presenting it to you. Gotta remember, things don‚Äôt work like people do‚Äù. If this is the way things worked, then it could happen on the opposite: just as something could show you respect, something else could target you.

We kept moving though; carcasses went in the trash and I took a power washer to the front of the house, and after some replacing of tiles, wood, the majority of the handprints were gone. I was tired of running and I wasn‚Äôt about to let anything scare or force me off this land, well, force ‚Äúus‚Äù now I guess as this isn‚Äôt a one man circus anymore.

Likewise there‚Äôs been developments on the grander scale, more specifically the shadow war PEXU is embroiled in against our adversaries. You ever wonder who leads the Blackwood Brotherhood? It‚Äôs a question that‚Äôs been raised by many, while the New Advent has Ryan Evans we all know that man‚Äôs nothing more than a gray skinned puppet with darkness behind his wide toothy smile. After he appeared at that meeting where he addressed the world flanked by politicians from north and South America, Europe, leading figures in economics and big tech‚Ä¶ an investigation was launched by the CIA‚Äôs Special Collection Service to track when this huge shift in momentum for them happened. They sorted through tens of thousands of emails, phone calls, texts, and found almost nothing relating to the New Advent at all.

Then‚Ä¶ a singular message shared on an encrypted messaging app by some lower level informant shells connected to our adversaries sent everyone into a panic. ‚ÄúBelial‚Äù; in Hebrew it means the Devil, in the context they found it in it reignited a manhunt that had gone cold nearly 32 years ago. Believed to be the victim of a death camp in the middle east, he was being tracked by Israeli intelligence for quite some time after a special mission unit they sent to capture him all turned up dead. No wound, blemishes, nothing, just cold and unalive. After that he fell off the grid and ever since they it‚Äôs been nothing but theories connecting him to the primordial death cult we currently face: cells found in Denmark, Great Britain talked about an Augur from Damascus instructing them to revive the PARAFOR leading to shit we are still fighting to this day. Every connection from groups or training groups we get stops, no names, no ranks‚Ä¶ just the tale of a man with dark red skin, sunken eyes and a bright white smile. His lips supposedly gone from acid burns that also line his body. Yet‚Ä¶ it was all conjecture, drawings in scribbles of mad men who died when they allowed ancient shit to crawl out of their bodies like molted animals.

Until one single message: *‚ÄúBelial will lead the way‚Äù.*

Then it all hit the fan: two operatives PEXU had with us, one from the agency and the other homeland security were found dead outside of a site that doesn‚Äôt exist on any manifest in the United States internal security directorate. No documentation exists because all of it‚Äôs funding is from black budget. The recovery teams assigned to retrieve them became casualties themselves as whoever left them there carved glyphs into their eyes‚Ä¶ the same one the Blackwood uses for indoctrination. Shortly after? Deep in the Amazon ABIN, Brazil‚Äôs premiere intelligence network, was searching for a facility hidden in the rainforest connected to the cult. Attached to them were some members of the Special Activities Division‚Ä¶ almost all of them didn‚Äôt make it out alive, half of them were grievously injured. A completely compartmentalized operation was compromised and ambushed‚Ä¶ worst yet was the place they were hunting for disappeared. Every piece of metal, everything from the satellite photos was gone, like it never existed.

2 steps forward, 3 back into the woodchipper.

I won‚Äôt lie, my security office has turned into that of a makeshift war room with pelican cases and tough boxes lining the walls, a rack securing my armament, and a cork board of all I‚Äôve learned complete with red string. The noose was tightening around our neck, 2 intelligence agencies experiencing major breaches, vew few within he FBI can be trusted and even MI6 needs to work in the shadows. Everyone from megachurches to corner stores is starting to wear those golden bands, and no one seems to be noticing. Not a peep or a whisper, anyone who does goes missing‚Ä¶ 110,000\~ a year and counting, if even a tenth of that has been turned into vessels for ascension then we are neck deep in enemies. Honestly staring too deeply into it all laid out like that makes me nearly go mad sometimes, sitting back in an armory knowing that just weeks ago we fought through hell just to get ourselves an inch of breathing room.

‚ÄúOh lord, don‚Äôt tell me, you‚Äôre going insane aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Isaac‚Äôs voice managed to draw me out of it with an eye roll as he walked in and took an eye at the board: ‚ÄúHey Dwight, if you are succumbing to whatever MKUltra stuff they pumped into your veins, give me a heads up so I can get out of the blast zone alright?‚Äù. We seemed to stare at each other for a good long while as he took a step closer to he, chuckling ‚ÄúAh! I‚Äôm just messing with yah, but for real, did they‚Ä¶ put anything in your coffee? I mean you never drank coffee last time I‚Äôd seen you so I‚Äôm wondering if you‚Äôre the real Dwight‚Ä¶-‚Äù.

Isaac somehow manages to say so much and yet nothing at the same time. He leaned back against the wall next to it, crossing his arms ‚ÄúSo, what now?‚Äù. I shrugged, I leaned back and grabbed my coffee that was sitting atop a palette of ammo cans ‚ÄúWe wait until we hear more‚Äù.

‚ÄúOh come on! There‚Äôs gotta be something we can do, call up that Hogwarts fellow of your, Montana-‚Äù.

‚ÄúMontgomery‚Äù I corrected him.

‚ÄúYeah sure, we can still do something, get back out there, hop in our supe-d up mystery machine and take it to ‚Äòem!‚Äù he said emphatically, pumping his fist in the air. A supe-d up mystery that had the transmission blown to hell ever since I had to floor it over a sasquatch back in the Dakotas‚Ä¶ more on that later.

‚ÄúIsaac, we‚Äôre part of an organization‚Ä¶ well, me, but-‚Äù. ‚ÄúI am too?!‚Äù Isaac said, I pinched the bridge of my nose realizing my mistake. ‚ÄúNo, I am, you are unofficially by association‚Äù. ‚ÄúStill, how‚Äôs the pay?‚Äù. ‚ÄúTerrible‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe benefits?‚Äù. ‚ÄúWorse‚Äù. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the incentive?‚Äù he asked, raising an eyebrow.  
‚ÄúDuty‚Äù. ‚ÄúOh god you guys really are insane‚Äù.

You think? Mortals using the modern day‚Äôs best armaments to cut through the hordes of wherever-the-hell to send whatever-the-hell back to where it was summoned from by other mortals. I‚Äôve seen more of our people succumb to injuries that can‚Äôt be determined by our laws of universe than slashes and guttings, yet I still clock in. There‚Äôs definitely something wrong with me.

‚ÄúI guess that gives us some time to think‚Ä¶ or well, remember‚Äù Isaac said, rubbing his head. It was no secret his lack of memory was weighing on him, he does a good job putting up a front. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had no contact with anyone? Haven‚Äôt been back there in?‚Ä¶‚Äù I asked, his eyes snapped to me ‚ÄúToo long‚Ä¶‚Äù. We had ourselves, the cult, but then there was Theodore Cazamoth, my old boss who was obsessed with seeing how he could industrialize the primordial to advance humanity. ‚ÄúAdvancement‚Äù that 4th Special Forces Group encountered on more than one occasion and lost more than a few of their own. We had been so dug in fighting a subversive apocalypse, what the hell was Theodore able to do the last 6 years?

We were going to have to find out‚Ä¶ later. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hitting the hay, let me know if some demon tries to tear our hearts out in the middle of the night, yeah?‚Äù Isaac said heading for the door. ‚ÄúWilco, if you get the chance before me, dump my body down a flight of stairs‚Äù I joked. Isaac stopped at the door as he looked around, then back to me ‚ÄúHey Dwight‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre back‚Äù. The sincerity in his words seemed to sober me up, the same feeling that drew me back to this years ago‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why I keep marching on. Not insanity or money, duty‚Ä¶ someone had to make the shit in the dark afraid, someone had to go in there and get vengeance for the grieving spouse, the crying child, the mourning parent, or those who went alone with no one to remember their name. I did‚Ä¶ every single person I have gotten some pound of justice for.

I woke up later around witching hour to grab a water. Zeus stayed in bed as I headed downstairs with iron in my pocket just in case someone wanted to try. I rounded the bannister as I reached the bottom of my stairs, my front door just ahead of them as the entire living room was laid out with a couch, chimney, table and all‚Ä¶ I stopped as my eyes snapped to the chair in the corner. I drew my pistol and tried to hit the light, nothing‚Ä¶ my finger felt the rail underneath where it should have been. A light then shined on me causing me to squint my eyes, it aimed down as my eyes adjusted‚Ä¶ it was my taclight.

‚ÄúYou rely on your equipment too much, Dwight Nolan‚Äù the figure sitting in the chair said, that of an impoverished male‚Äôs voice. The moonlight just barely missed them as shadows cloaked them, they tossed the taclight to me causing it to bounce across the floor. With my pistol still aimed I reached down and placed it back on and got a good lock at them. In a dark suit and dress shoes was a bald man, gray skin with dozens of stitches of different sutures lined their head. A black set of shades hid their eyes as on their lap they held what looked to be a chalkboard.

*‚ÄúDwight Anthony Nolan. 39 years old. Son, Leader, Killer‚Ä¶‚Äù.*

Tally marks were underneath, hundreds of tally marks‚Ä¶ each one of them dark red, whispering to me. I knew what they meant‚Ä¶ a name, an age, a birth and death date. Some were the things I had been ordered to cut down, target packages filled in the dozens‚Ä¶ over a hundred. I looked to them, then back to the man; ‚ÄúWho the fuck are you?‚Äù.

‚ÄúA watcher, numbers keeper mostly‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou got some sort of point in doing this? I‚Äôve got half a mind to-‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a lot of blood on your hands‚Äù the stitched up freak said accusingly. ‚ÄúWhat? Sad I put down your friends? Or something in the woods, or the swamp, or across the ocean. I‚Äôm not gonna apologize‚Äù I growled, my finger well on the trigger as I started to apply force. ‚ÄúWhat about them?‚Äù it said staring blankly at me, pointing to another tally mark‚Ä¶ Alyssa, Age 23, born in the Navajo Nation, died because we weren‚Äôt fast enough to reach her house to tell her to get to safety. It‚Äôs hand pointed to another‚Ä¶ These weren‚Äôt just kills, these were people I had failed to save. Sometimes it was because I had a wrong lead, other times I was just too slow, some there was nothing I could do‚Ä¶ but it was on my soul.

‚ÄúProtectors have continued to form a membrane of annoyance for thousands of years, Dwight Nolan. We are closer than ever to shifting the momentum back to the era where you hid in the caves protected by a campfire and a stick‚Äù It said with glee in it‚Äôs voice. It was well aware of the pressure going on around the world, it knew that I knew as well‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt give it an inch. ‚ÄúWell you won‚Äôt be there to see it‚Äù I said, pulling the trigger‚Ä¶ the gun didn‚Äôt fire. I raised an eyebrow as suddenly I could hear pounding on the door that made my heart shoot straight into my throat.

‚ÄúNo, Dwight Nolan, you won‚Äôt. You didn‚Äôt really think hiding in the rockies would save you, would it?‚Äù my light went out‚Ä¶ and I woke up in bed. That being said, I woke up to a chorus of alerts coming from the speaker on my night stand; \[‚ÄúMultiple intrusions detected‚Ä¶ multiple intrusions detected‚Ä¶. Condition Alamo, Condition Alamo, Condition, Alamo‚Äù\].

Something had followed us home.

Dossier: Condition Alamo Alamo‚Ä¶ in every military there‚Äôs a contingency when deployed for whenever the wire is breached and the enemy has entered. The Poles I worked with liked to use the term Red, a Brit unit I worked with preferred Direct Fire Charlie. I‚Äôve always stuck with one I‚Äôve encountered at a number of American Fobs: Alamo.

Zeus was barking a storm as I could hear banging coming from the front door downstairs, for reference I bought a steel lined reinforced door with heavy duty hinges and several locks. That being said I had also gotten into scraps with things that cut through material tougher than it with no issues. I had minutes at most‚Ä¶ I scrambled out of bed to find my pistol on my nightstand, drawing it and scanning around. Zeus was standing on the bed growling‚Ä¶ the banging had stopped as I looked‚Ä¶ no moonlight just like there had been hours ago.

I approached the curtains and peeked just under the edge to see, only to find an eye staring back. It was completely white, the iris gone with a pinprick needle for a pupil‚Ä¶ my blood ran cold, I remember that kind of eye. I stumbled back and aimed my boomstick but only darkness remained. Then‚Ä¶ laughter, dozens of different cackles, jeers, echoed from the outside‚Ä¶ this wasn‚Äôt right, this‚Ä¶ I had been here before, I had encountered something exactly like this‚Ä¶ back when I was just a security guard hired to protect that fuckin‚Äô forest estate.

Fuck this, we need to kit up quick. I opened the my door and shined my pistol light around, clear left and right, a few doors ahead of me were the bathroom and a study, directly to my right was the armory. I took a step out, watching the stairs down to my left‚Ä¶ only to be deafened when a gunshot rang out to my right‚Ä¶ The round barely missed me as it hit the doorway of the bathroom just in front of me, the snap and wood shavings from it showering the area as I ducked down and gripped my ear, aiming my boomstick, it was Isaac‚Ä¶ who immediately waved his hands.

‚ÄúAh hell!! Sorry!!!‚Äù. ‚ÄúIsaac what the fuck?!‚Äù I exclaimed, though I could also barely hear him as he walked over and shouted. I nursed my ear as he asked ‚ÄúHello!? You hearing me?!‚Äù.

‚ÄúNo, you deafened me!! The hell did you say?!‚Äù I asked, his answer sent a chill up my spine: ‚ÄúLook I had already seen you just before the house started to scream at us, and you nearly bit my fuckin‚Äô head off!!‚Äù. Seen me? I stood up as I scanned around ‚ÄúIsaac what the hell are you talking about?‚Äù.

‚ÄúI woke up just before the alarms started to go off, you were creeping over my bed and I was getting a bad vibe‚Ä¶ then you tried to leap on me, and I grabbed this and started to fire into you-‚Äù he said showing the Glock 19 I had given him as a bedside carry. This was odd because that was sure to have woken me up. I looked to him, my ears still pounding ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ where did‚Ä¶ I go?‚Äù I asked. A crash from downstairs caused both of us to turn and aim at the stairwell down,, Zeus had crept into the hall and began to growl at it. I reached over and pulled him by his collar ‚ÄúIsaac‚Ä¶ into the safe room, now‚Äù.

All three of us got into that armory as Isaac locked the door, I took to the desk connected to the security system as Isaac went to work preparing himself some firepower. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?!‚Äù he asked and frankly I was asking the same thing. I pulled up the grid to my property‚Ä¶ out of the several dozen motion detectors and trail cams I had set up, over 60% of them were offline, the rest were in states of damage, flickering, and only a few worked‚Ä¶ one of which was one adjacent to my driveway. A single pinprick eye looked through the tall glass, then before I could even register it‚Ä¶ a flash of silver, blackened nails on a bloated dead hand pried the camera‚Äôs steel and concrete embedded post out of the ground and smashed the unit.

That skin‚Ä¶ that hand.

I switched between the cameras, so many of them were out of commission. Some were smashed and nearly tore off their mounts, others just flashed LED colors with fragments of their vision still intact. The driveway ones were already taken out, the one on the front of the house was completely offline, something had already invaded the property and taken out our eyes‚Ä¶ not only that, but it knew where to look. I saw the notification for sound being registered, I got some crackles, static, like I expected‚Ä¶ but then, cackles‚Ä¶ deep, warped cackles of what sounded like a dozen people forced into one.

I had‚Ä¶ stopped this, I thought I did.

Then, just as I did one more run back through all of the cameras‚Ä¶ unit 21, mounted near the peak of the back of the house, highest up‚Ä¶ registered a voice. It came through calm, almost a whisper, but like some sort of predator that caught it‚Äôs prey it called out: ‚ÄúNolan‚Ä¶.‚Äù. A sudden thrash as something monstrous running across the roof shook the whole damn house, caused me to almost lose balance as I held onto the house.

‚ÄúWhat-in-the-bayou-fuck is going on?!‚Äù Isaac said, looking over my shoulder. I looked back to see he had gotten himself 2 bandoliers of shotgun shells, including a belt‚Ä¶ while in his tank top and shorts. Zeus was barking, as the sound of something crawling around the outside caught his attention. Then‚Ä¶ the movement on the roof stopped, towards the center; wet tearing and ripping, flesh and tendons, I know that sound anywhere, echoed‚Ä¶ as thuds sounded on the roof. I switched off the cameras and made for my equipment table, prepping my rifle as I pulled my belt and plate carrier on.

‚ÄúIs that shit sounding like what I think it‚Äôs sounding?‚Äù Isaac asked, aiming his shotgun around at whatever the hell was deciding to demonically touch every ceiling tile out there. He was feeling the familiar feeling too, this rhymed all too closely to whatever the hell was at the Cazamoth estate. ‚ÄúThose intelligence leaks‚Äù I pointed out, ‚ÄúYou think they found us as well?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI think something found us‚Ä¶‚Äù; I tried to key into my radio; \[‚ÄúMain this is November-1‚Ä¶‚Äù\].

Nothing, I tried again: \[‚ÄúNovember-1 to Main, serious situation, I need support‚Ä¶.‚Äù\]. Still nothing, dead silent, I looked back to him ‚ÄúEither our comms are cut, or our friends are preoccupied‚Äù.

Front outside towards the front, a thunderous roar sounded followed by what I knew damn sure was my front door being forced off his hinges and the snap of my bannister soon after. Isaac snapped towards the door with his shotgun as I pulled down my night vision, my rifle‚Äôs laser trained on the door as well. ‚ÄúSo? What‚Äôs the plan? Sit tight and wait for help?‚Äù Isaac asked.

‚ÄúHelp ain‚Äôt coming Isaac, and by the time we even get a word out for help these things will be right ontop of us‚Äù I said, the sounds growing louder. The barrel of his shotgun dipped every slightly ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what do we do?‚Äù.

Simple: ‚Äú-We get the hell off my lawn‚Äù.

Zeus began to bark as a set of footsteps raced up the stairs and towards the door could be heard, the sound of a woman‚Äôs full lung scream growing louder. It began to slam on the door again, and again, finally it gave way and she stumbled in. In some tattered gown barely covering her dead skin soaked in what looked like tar. Her arms were bisected longways as she clawed at the floor more insect than human, through her long hair she looked to us, her face peeking through as whatever was coating her at through it‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how she was even screaming, just a gap in her skull where her face was. She roared again; ‚ÄúAh Jesus hell!!!!‚Äù Isaac yelled as he blasted her in the chest with his shotgun. The scatter blast tore through her hip and momentarily stopped her, however she used her multiple limbs to launch right at us‚Ä¶

I responded with a group of shots, tearing through her torso, she fell onto the large wooden ready table I had in the center sending ammo cans of rounds tumbling off, and tools flying. Zeus barked snapping his jaws at her from the ground, she stood up and Isaac got one hell of a good shot at her shoulder.

She went flying back against the wall, Zeus grabbing onto her leg and beginning to kill shake it out of her socket. I joined and fired several rounds, the snap of my suppressor echoing as they impacted her brainstem. That corrosive shit splattered all along the wall as she grew still. Zeus seemed to back off, he could tell from the smell that none of that was good. A moment of still occurred and I closed the distance, I used the tip of my suppressor to move her head to the side as that shit fell onto the floor. I watched it impact the floorboards‚Ä¶ the black ichor seemed to‚Ä¶ move. My mind thought back to the plastic baggie of shit I had encountered, between the coloration, the eyes, the laughs‚Ä¶ the substance.

‚ÄúThis is from the Cazamoth Estate-‚Äù I stated my theory as I knelt down next to the corpse. ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt no way though, I read your entire memoir on that, you killed those freaks‚Äù Isaac said, scanning around with his Mossberg not wanting to even think of the theory. ‚Äú-Then tell me, Isaac, what the hell are they filled with the exact same shit from south Missouri?‚Äù I barked back. Our debate was cut short as a rumbling could be heard, inside of the walls. We could hear every single shuffle, and pained movement as it closed in on the vent‚Ä¶ it fuckin‚Äô popped off, a set of bloated dead arms, skin that cut itself on the metal edges and spewed puss, reached through as they aggressively tried to force themselves through. Two slimy heads, eyes sunken in dark rings, pin prick eyes and brown toothy smiles were attempting to force themselves through, to the point the wall around the vent opening contorted and bent. ‚ÄúIsaac!!! Nolan!!! Isaac!!! Nolan!!!‚Äù their voices sung with each other as they screamed. There was something about their aggression, their hatred I could feel through their forced smiles that was just shocking, making you feel like prey. I didn‚Äôt say a word, I fired my rifle, tearing through their skin, Isaac let loose with his shotgun.

The resulting blast of buckshot tore through the vent, showering the trio in pellets and broken metal, as the floor and wall around was torn up, all that remained was a pile of mess that was once human. I turned towards him ‚ÄúStill skeptical now?‚Äù. Isaac steadied himself the best he could, his stock in his armpit as he sheepishly dug‚Ä¶ oh for fucksakes, he dug a flask out of his shorts and tool a long sip; ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm right here with you‚Äù.

‚ÄúFor fucksakes, Isaac‚Ä¶‚Äù I shook my head, he looked ‚ÄúWhat?! They‚Äôre invading, I‚Äôm standing our ground!!!‚Äù.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say redecorate my entire fuckin‚Äô house with double ought buck while you‚Äôre plaster out your-‚Äù our argument was cut short as the sounds of more of them from the stairwell could be heard. ‚ÄúHow about this: We clear this place of ghouls, and I‚Äôll fund the reconstruction‚Äù Isaac quipped. With what money, Isaac? you sleep on my couch‚Ä¶ or well, figuratively, or he‚Äôd be down there getting possessed and quartered by the neighborhood brigade right now. ‚ÄúWe beat them before, we can do it again, let‚Äôs go‚Äù I asserted to him, he nodded and followed.

My laser scanned as we pushed into the hallway, Isaac cleared right as I pushed forward towards the stairs, he joined me as Zeus was at our feet sniffing ahead. I was on the left side of the hall, my laser aimed down the stairs, I could see the remnants of the door hinges torn clean off‚Ä¶ they were rated for 3,500lbs of incoming force, whatever came through here did so with a vengeance.

We pushed down the stairs, my barrel leading the way and centered on the wide open front door as Isaac watched our flank. As I reached the ground floor, I shuffled right and pied around the opening, I could hear them running throughout the tall grass, laughing, whispering, eyes peeking out and then ducking back with speeds too quick for their hulking forms. all peeking through as they could see me better than my dual tubes could. Then from the tall grass, one of them bolted out. ‚ÄúIncoming!!!‚Äù I yelled, heading over to the doorway I fired as the gray mass closed the distance across my front area onto the porch. I fired rounds that cut through it‚Äôs back, lodged right in it‚Äôs body, black splashes filled the are and yet it still kept it‚Äôs momentum.

‚ÄúMove!!-‚Äù.

That‚Äôs all I could get out as Isaac ducked right, Zeus barked as the thing charged and knocked me clean off my ass through the air and into my couch. It didn‚Äôt seem to care how many rounds I fired into it, I rolled off and groggily got a good lock. Its still human torso was the cross roads for a horrifying monstrosity where dog-like legs met an army that was that of a centipede, but the chitin was made out of calcified black flesh. The other one was seemingly made of glass and had gaps between bones, the head was fighting between several different mouths, gray and sunken into it‚Äôs torso‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs sunken pin prick eyes centered on me

Whatever the hell happened to it, it decided to turn their soul into some sort of skin split thing. It‚Äôs voice was that of dozens, roars, yells, and yet it semi coherently all said: ‚ÄúNolan‚Äù.

I tried to back up as it reached down, the centipede arm gnawing at my plate carrier, tearing through the nylon cordura as I fired into it‚Äôs torso sending chunks of flesh and bone flying out the back. Zeus lept on top zinking his teeth into it‚Äôs neck causing it to yell what sounded like a cross between a tiger and a ma. Isaac planted his shotgun right on the skull, the shot caused the entire thing to explode out which completely showered me‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt know what was worse: being covered in dead person or dead rotten beast.

I forced my buttstock into the ground, my head still rolling around as Isaac took point and looked to me: ‚ÄúHow you feeling? You got knocked a country mile‚Äù.

I felt the base of my neck that still felt like it was on fire: ‚ÄúBeen worse, landed right on my neck. ‚ÄúQuick, how many fingers am I holding up?‚Äù. ‚ÄúIsaac you‚Äôre not holding up any‚Äù. ‚ÄúSee? You‚Äôre good‚Äù.

From the doorway to the kitchen, a set of elongated arms connected to a body that was stretched and contorted beyond human proportions. It stepped in bow legged, its face‚Ä¶ a human skull that had been buried and pushed into the collar bone area sat below a smooth, angler fish like top portion. Two sets of jaws forced together, formed some horrifying maw that just hurt to look at,  like knives being dragged down my bare bones. We quickly fired on it, it grabbed onto the ground around it and spat at us‚Ä¶ that same tar like shit, Isaac was quicker that I was. Some of it hit directly on the plate carrier, eating into my ATAK. The smell was‚Ä¶ awful, it began to fuck with me, I didn‚Äôt know it until well into it‚Äôs effects but soon I realized I was hallucinating.

My eyes burned, my nose doing everything it could to exorcize the feeling to no avail, the pounding noise in my head felt like screams and chants. It felt real, every gust of wind, everything was hypersensitive. I scanned around, the ground unsteady, then it lunged at me. I could feel it‚Äôs claws slashing into my skin, I screamed and fired at it although it just degloved my arms like it was nothing, I could see the veins and blood underneath as it threw me into a wall and it gave in. I stood up and I was back‚Ä¶ upstairs? The thing came charging down and I managed to clip the human skull underneath, causing it to stumble. As it did I fired, the flash of my suppressor under nods short, small, yet controlled as I tore through one of it‚Äôs legs.

It then reached out and hooked my jaw‚Ä¶. Then pulled and yanked it clean off. The feeling of my tongue flapping around, my gasps for air‚Ä¶ I dropped my rifle to it‚Äôs sking as it slashed at my face. I fell to the ground, back in the living room‚Ä¶ Zeus was now gnawing at it‚Äôs head as it reached for him.

Not. My. Fuckin. Dog. I fired an entire magazine into it, having switched to auto it tore through it‚Äôs center off mass. I then charged forward and tackled it to the ground, the armored knuckles on my gloves being buried into it‚Äôs head. It‚Äôs elongated arms tried to reach and tear through my plates, I didn‚Äôt care, hell I took off my helmet and began to pound it over, and over, with the clear side of my kevlar. The burning feeling it had on my corneas combined with a chorus of screams that just wouldn‚Äôt end, I would make it end. It‚Äôs head snapped back as it began to be crushed, soon the vortex-like swirls that formed it‚Äôs eyes began to snap back‚Ä¶ looking human, and looked‚Ä¶ like me.

Isaac threw me to the ground, I gasped as I could feel the clear air again, my vision normal as the property, the house‚Ä¶ everything was silent. Zeus was sat in the center carpet‚Ä¶ surrounded by dozens of malformed, transformed adversaries that were now spending their last seconds on this earth bleeding out. I sat up, catching my breath. I looked around‚Ä¶ the beast with the elongated arms was laying on the floor, it‚Äôs head completely pulverized‚Ä¶ my helmet embedded into it. I looked to Isaac, I‚Äôll be honest I was shaken the fuck up ‚ÄúW-What the fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù.

‚ÄúYeah you lost your shit‚Ä¶ a bunch of them began to pour in, you were firing wildly, you started tearing them apart‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, I raised an eyebrow, I didn‚Äôt remember that and I still don‚Äôt but I looked around. There was a hole in my wall wide open into my kitchen‚Ä¶ some sort of hound like beast, skeletal with blood and muscle being it‚Äôs only exterior had it‚Äôs throat ripped out and my multitool stuck in its skull. My rifle was on the ground, bolt locked to the rear amongst several others.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear anything else‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, staggering to my feet. ‚ÄúYeah, I think we might‚Äôve gotten them all‚Ä¶‚Äù Isaac said, he paused for a moment, looking around ‚ÄúOkay, no jinxing us this time, I think they‚Äôre actually all dead‚Ä¶ or escaped‚Äù. I quickly cleared and replenished my rifle, Isaac and I secured the kitchen and basement, right around when we got primary power back on‚Ä¶ my radio crackled to life.

\[‚ÄúNovember-1, sitrep‚Ä¶‚Äù\] it was Montgomery‚Äôs voice. I looked to Isaac before hitting the push-to-talk; \[‚ÄúThis is November-1, just experienced an attack on my residence, it got kinetic‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre still alive but in a bad way‚Ä¶ how copy?‚Äù\].

A few seconds of static, some failed key-in attempts‚Ä¶ Montgomery answered \[‚ÄúRoger that‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got an organization wide attack‚Ä¶ stay put and prepare the best you can‚Äù\]. Isaac scoffed, rolling his eyes he kicked the mangled remains of something that was formerly intruding, now decomposing ‚Äúyeah, tell manchester it‚Äôs a little late for that‚Äù.

\[‚ÄúNovember-1 to Main, I‚Äôve got several dozen EKIA, I need reinforcements-‚Äù\].

What he said next planted a deep pit in my stomach: \[‚ÄúDozens of PEXU solo units have not reported back in, November-1. We‚Äôre barely able to take accountability. Hunker down the best you can and we will be coming for you‚Ä¶ Main-Out‚Äù\]. There Isaac and I stood in my house, I sighed as he slung his shotgun, looking around ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶. Nail and boards?‚Äù.

I pinched the bridge of my nose; ‚ÄúWhat are we going to just board up all the holes and sit next to the radio?‚Äù. We did, it took around 25 minutes however Isaac and I successfully and haphazardly re-secured the house. Occasionally we would hear the sound of something outside, neither of us went to look however we did keep our weapons ready, nothing would attack again. In the morning the sound of an SUV approaching after the sun rose above the horizon cautioned all three of us to approach, my suppressor and his barrel sticking out gaps in the boards.

The blacked out vic parked in my driveway, the door opened and a young man in a navy suit, slicked back hair exited. He kept his hands up, only moving one to take his sunglasses off‚Ä¶. Montgomery chuckled at the state of things before he looked at the structure: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it, you‚Äôve had a very entertaining night, November-1?‚Äù.

I drew my barrel back from the opening and peeked through ‚ÄúYou can say that‚Ä¶ how‚Äôs everyone else doing?‚Äù. The smirk on his face faded as he sighed, approaching ‚ÄúSMUs survived intact, many weren‚Äôt touched for obvious reasons‚Ä¶ others like yourself, intelligence personnel‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say we‚Äôve got less comrades than when the night started‚Äù. That‚Äôs where we are at right now; Isaac and I are still holding down the fort, surprisingly we‚Äôve gotten the actual structure resecured but let‚Äôs just say it won‚Äôt be pretty for some time. I don‚Äôt plan on leaving anytime soon‚Ä¶ this place is my home, I hid here when I wanted to step away, and I don‚Äôt plan on running off again. PEXU has taken a considerable amount of casualties, though we‚Äôve sustained it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time for us to hunker down, lick our wounds, and soon we will be counter attacking. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs not, just a little bit shot to hell right now‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll get back to it.

We‚Äôll take it to them, their home, their blood‚Ä¶ Montgomery has also said PEXU is interested in looking into whatever Theodor Cazamoth has been doing‚Ä¶ because that black ichor we found on many of those bastards that tried to gut Isaac, Zeus, and I? They match samples recovered from a facility found on the east coast, one that 4th Special Forces Group touched down at a few years ago‚Ä¶. The same substance I encountered while I was defending Cazamoth‚Äôs estate.

It‚Äôs not over, we‚Äôll be back.

For part 1 
https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystoryemporium/s/tdKfzh29ls

I sat in bed listening to the rush of the town below my apartment building: People yelling, cars honking, babies crying... Hard to believe it was 3 in the morning with how active the streets were. Those who weren't out, were glued to their televisions watching the lastest emergency update. 

For Poland had changed course, and our location was on the ""estimated locations list"". We'd all seen what happens, when Poland climbs it's putrid, amoeba-like country over an area. We'd seen the towns, cities, *countries* completely leveled, from being underneath it. No homes, no grass, no trees. The only time Poland actually didn't change much landscape were those weeks it was stuck in the Sahara desert. 

Now it was coming here. New regulations had the UN, NATO, FEMA, and whatever else, taking the responsibility of helping get all humans out of Polands path. Usually folks had a few days to evacuate. Some only had hours. Some people chose to stay. 

I, myself, truly have stopped caring. *I knew* about this phenomenon at the beginning of April and no one believed me. My research lined up perfectly with that of the seismologists. But I found something else. 

I found...  

A heartbeat...

...and was immediately mocked.

And I get it! It's completely ridiculous for a large piece of earth to suddenly have an even, rhythmic pulse. But that was my job, at the environmental protection agency -to find life in unlikely places- and I was good at it! That's why I was known all around the world.  That's why as soon as things started getting weird in Poland, I showed up to examine things, myself. Except once I made that discovery, they threw me aside. Clearly I had gone bonkers. All because I had some crazy hypothesis and acted on it. 

When I first heard Polands's heart, mine nearly stopped. I called my connections with the UN Security Council, a gave my findings and concerns. I could tell they thought I was nuts, but they humoured me anyway. In the end, they asked what I wanted from them. Of course, I said I needed funding, and a crew to pursue this, and that's when they couldn't hide their laughter anymore. They said I was ridiculous for requesting so much for such an impossible theory. After that, not only did they turn me down, but they dropped all other funding also. 

And so now I lay here. Listening to chaos flow over our little city of Decatur, Illinois. The light of the tv flooding my room, showing the disasters of Poland in real time. 

My phone lights up, and I look to see my old buddy Jeremy calling. Fuck that guy. I let it go to voicemail. He calls two more times before I finally answer. 

""Hello.""

""Dammit, Jordan! Why won't you respond to us?!?""

""Gosh, I mean, I've been so busy. Studying mushrooms, and dragonflies. There's this new show out that covers both of those things along with unicorns and fairies. I mean, I can't afford to actually go out and study *real* ecosystems, since y'all cut my funding-

""Enough!"" Jeremy took a deep breath, trying to calm down, ""Look. We need you. We are willing to admit you were right, and we were wrong. We'll do whatever you want, just please say you'll meet with us, to discuss Poland.""

I thought about it for a few seconds. Maybe I could stand to survive for just a little bit longer. Except... ""I'm in Decatur. I'm right on Poland's path. Unless you can get me out of here, I can't help you.""

""Please, we've had your location for weeks. A chopper is on its way now. Get to your apartment's roof top."" 

Soon I was being flown toward a convention center, states away. Out of Polands's path. For now. 

Landing on the center's rooftop I could see Jeremy, and a few other gentlemen, waiting for me. We didn't shake hands, as I made it to them. They just turned and gestured for me to follow. They all looked exhausted. I forgot it was now probably 4 or 5 in the morning. but who knows how long these men have been up, trying to figure out ways to get Poland under control. 

We made it to a large conference room filled with technology. TV and computer screens lined the walls. Radios and other communication systems covered the desks. There were 6 other people in the room, monitoring specific screens. This must have been the new home base for the security council. 

""Take a seat"" Jeremy said, ""coffee?""

""Oh, yes please"" I responded, casually. 

Another man came and sat by me, and opened a laptop. ""Hello Jordan, my name is Rodney. I'm glad you made it hear safely, but we don't have much time to rest. Here, I have put together a list of everything we need to go over""

Jeremy brought me my coffee as Rodney continued, ""We're going to start at the beginning. When the earthquakes began. That was into the first week of April. A few different crews went out to do research-""

""Like me. Like when I found the heart beat and y'all dismissed me""

""Oh for the love of....just... just shut up, Jordan!"" Jeremy mumbled behind me, while pinching the bridge of his nose. 

Rodney continued, ""By mid-April, we had confirmed that all the quakes took place on the entire border of Poland, and by that time, the edges of the country were separating from the surrounding countries. 

""Also during that time is when Poland started rising in size, and changing it's shape, it caused huge quakes in Lithuania, Belarus, and Germany.

""During the first half of April, we did encourage those living in Poland to evacuate, and while we got a few hundred people out, safely, many didn't believe it was a threat, until it was too late. 

""As soon as Poland had finished rising in elevation and changing shape, it began to move, which was at the beginning of May.

""As we've seen through satellite images, anything Poland moves over is consumed. Lakes dry up, and whole cities disappear. 

""Planes and helicopters, more so, are nearly impossible to fly over Poland while it's moving. Our computers go haywire, causing crashes half the time. We have had a tiny bit of luck, landing aircrafts on the country while it's stopped. But it's nearly impossible to know when Poland will start moving again. Sometimes Poland is stopped for days, weeks, or just hours.""

I held up my hand, ""Has it been tried.... or... So, how about this scenario: we fly a plane onto Poland while it's stopped, with no intention of moving it, until the *next* time it's stopped. Giving people more time to all get to the plane, and more time to fly out of Poland."" 

""It's been tried."" Jeremy looked down and sighed. 

""Well, the news hasn't covered that.""

""Because it failed. It seems Poland can sense large gatherings of humans. We've had completely filled planes, sink down into Poland, right before take-off."" 

Rodney added, ""There have been some rogue pilots who've flown in and out of the country, and  were lucky enough not to be consumed, and also were able to get some people evacuated. But because of the risks, we no longer send large planes over. 

""We can't even get ""plane alerts"" out to the citizens, since they lost power. We've had planes land and stay down for days, with no one showing up.""

We all sat there quietly for a moment. Then Rodney pulled up the next talking point, ""Since Poland started moving, we've seen damage to Ukraine, Russia, down through Pakistan, and into India. The ocean has no affect on it, because next it crossed through Australia, down to New Zealand. 

""That's kind of when we learned that Poland had no strategy to where it went. It did a 180¬∞ and headed to Africa, starting down at South Africa, and making it's way north, until it hit the Sahara, and..."" Rodney squinted at his notes, ""that was the end of June. We were both relieved and concerned, because in the desert, Poland got very slow. We thought it may...die? Which would stop all the chaos""

""And the concern?""

""Well, obviously, because it's getting closer to America.""

""I will say, it was a pretty good try, with the nukes while Poland was in the Atlantic.""

Rodney read his notes, ""Yeah, that's next here: While in the Atlantic, it was decided not to nuke Poland, itself, but the water around it, hoping to change the countries course."" 

""Like I said... good try."" I sipped my coffee. 

""So that takes us to now. Poland it making it's way straight through the US."" Rodney closed his laptop. He folded his hands and looked at me. 

I sat there, waiting for more information. ""So..what do you want from me?"" 

Jeremy and Rodney looked at each other and back at me, ""Well. Obviously we we want to stop it. And we're running out of ideas."" 

Rodney added, ""Of course, we don't want to bomb it. Well, we do, but we don't want to hurt the remaining people on the country.""

""Frankly, if there's anyone left on Poland, I think they'd be fine with that."" I chuckled. 

Jeremy sat in the chair on the other side of me. He looked like he was struggling to get words out, ""So... You found a heartbeat.""

""Yes.""

""Which... Of course means it's alive.""

""That's pretty obvious.""

""I'm curious, if you think..."" Jeremy took a deep breath, ""if you think... There's some way to communicate with it.""

I stared at Jeremy, almost not believing what I just heard. I could barely take a breath, before I bursted into laughter. 

The men stayed silent while I laughed. They knew how their question sounded. 

I finally took a breath, ""You guys thought my theory on a heartbeat was crazy, and then you ask me this?? What kind of sense does that even make?! You want to communicate with a piece of land?!"" I was almost angry now.

Jeremy: ""Well what the fuck else are we supposed to do?!"" 

Me: ""It's a fucking country! A bordered piece of land!""

Jeremy: ""You think I don't know that??""

Me: ""It doesn't make sense!""

Jeremy: ""None of this makes sense! We are out of options though!""

Me: ""I actually had proof! Proof of a heartbeat, and *probably* COULD have figured out more about why this fucking country now has an organic anatomy, but YALL shut down my FUNDING!""

Jeremy, ""Oh gosh... Because you sounded CRAZY!""

Rodney broke between us, ""Guys please!"" He walked over to two maps. One of Poland before it changed, and one from after. ""Jordan, do you think you could remember where you were, when you discovered the heartbeat?"" 

I rolled my eyes and walked over to him. ""What are you thinking?"" 

Rodney sighed, ""We have an idea. I don't know if it's the best idea, but like Jeremy said, we're out of options."" 

I looked over at Jeremy, and then back to Rodney. 

""We saw that it struggled in the desert. That means it can feel stress, maybe even pain. And that maybe it can even be killed. If we can pinpoint the heart, perhaps, we can drop just *one* bomb, right over it.""

Now I was pinching my nose bridge, ""You guys know how heartbeats work, right?;"" 

Jeremy and Rodney stared at me. 

""Dropping a bomb over Poland where you hear the heartbeat, would be similar to, if I put a stethoscope to my foot and claimed my heart was there, because I could hear my pulse there.""

Jeremy threw his arms up, ""Why the FUCK did I bring you in?!"" 

""I don't know, Jeremy! You could have *left* me in Poland where I could have actually triangulated the heartbeat! We could have had a lead! Now we have nothing! We have no...."" 

I stared at one screen on the far wall. It was putting X's over every spot on Poland where sinkholes appeared. I walked over to the screen. Were the sink holes random? Or did they have a pattern? 

I looked over at the guys, ""We're going to need more coffee."" 

A tiny smile appeared on Jeremy's face. But it quickly went away as the room started to shake.

Rodney looked to one of the screen watchers, ""Judith, where's Poland's location??"" 

A woman named Judith pulled up satellite images. ""Ugh.... Alaska. Wait. Russia. Oh gosh, it's moving so fast!"" 

""Why's it going so fast??"" Rodney exclaimed.

I quickly sat down at a computer and started calculating. 

""What are you doing?"" Jeremy asked.

""With Poland going so fast, we may have even less time. There's no way we can nuke it, at that speed. But we can be ready, for when it stops again. If it stops again."" 

""And if it doesn't?"" 

I didn't respond. There was no time. I had to hope there was some method to where the sinkholes appeared. ""Judith, please keep an eye of where Poland is"". 

Hours went by. Maybe even days. The vibrations didn't stop. Poland hadn't slowed down. It sped over Russia, to areas north of Canada. It was doing laps around Earth. I couldn't believe we were still alive. 

I was quiet. Measuring distance from sinkhole to sinkhole. Noting the places that weren't affected. And calculating the possibilities of where they could arise. 

""There"" I said. Rodney and Jeremy came to my side, ""There's your Fucking heart!"" Jeremy nearly collapsed on the table. Rodney grabbed my shoulders in a congratulatory fashion. 

""Ok so where's the closest base? Who's still available? What's the next step?"" 

""Guys."" 

We all looked over at Judith. 

""It's. It's coming."" 

My heart sank. Would this all have been for nothing? 

All of us in the room looked at each other and appeared to have the same thing on our mind. There was no stopping Poland. And there wasn't enough time to evacuate.

I ran out of the room.

""Where are you going Jordan??"" Jeremy followed me out. Soon everyone was following, as I climbed the stairs to the roof top. 

Up on the roof, panting, I scanned the area, spinning until I saw the direction where I knew Poland would be coming from. 

There it was. Who knows how far it was, but I could see it's disastrous wreckage. The smoke and dust filling the skyline. 

Everyone stood around me. Some people holding each other, others silently staring. There was nothing to do but watch, until we were also absorbed by Poland.

There wasn't even time to recall my fondest memories. My childhood. My family. 

There was only Poland. 

""It's getting closer!"" Another woman sobbed into Judith's arms. 

But then something happened. As the building shook harder... as Poland got closer....

It lifted off the ground. 

What were we witnessing?? 

I fell to my knees, as I saw the large country literally take flight.

""My God..."" Rodney gasped. 

We watched. 

We watched it get higher. 

And higher. 

Until it was above the sky. 

Above the atmosphere. 

Poland was in space. 

After MONTHS of causing chaos all over the planet...

Poland was gone. 


2 months later...

Poland is moving. 

Actually Poland hadn't stopped moving. Ever since it jumped off of Earth, it has been chugging along in space, passing other planets. People who survived Poland, have all come together to build small, close communities. Slowly, life will become normal again. 

""Jordan, are you still here?"" I heard a voice call from down the hall. Of course I knew who it was, and didn't respond. Jeremy popped his head into the conference room. He scanned over the dark room, until he saw me, lit up by a computer screen, in the back corner.  

Quietly he came and sat be me. He cleared his throat, ""Jordan. I'm concerned.""

I didn't look away from the screen. 

""You've been up here, by yourself for weeks now. Poland's been declared 'not a threat' to the planet for a whole month. Please, get up. Come stay with me. Come see how we've rebuilt some cities."" 

I sighed and looked over at him, ""Not yet.""

Jeremy, eyes were sad, ""...I'll be back tomorrow. Please try and get some decent sleep."" As he stood up, he dropped a bag of food on the desk. 

He was a good friend. But I had to stay here. I had to make sure Poland didn't return. I stared at different windows on my screen. One showing earth, one showing emergency updates from all around the world, and one that sent updated images on where Poland was in space. 

I had to keep watching. 

I had to make sure. 

Poland wasn't dead. It was just gone. 

But if it came back, I knew how to kill it. 

So for now, I'll just keep watch.

1hyliqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hyliqc/bedtime_book_recommendations/,Bedtime Book Recommendations ,"Hi all! I am looking for recommendations for books to read before bed. I am an extremely anxious woman, so I am seeking something soothing and calming. Right now I am reading Full Moon Coffee Shop which, admittedly, is not all that great, but it really puts my mind in a good place for sleeping. I‚Äôm looking for something that might include some of these key words: slice-of-life, animals, light fantasy, spirituality, city life, world cultures, coffee shops, magic.

The vibe should be light, breezy, whimsical, cute, and/or cozy. I‚Äôm not looking for the novel of the year here; just a light, positive read that can slow my thoughts, calm my body, and help me prepare for sleep.

Many thanks in advance! üôèüèª ",3,1736561473.0,booksuggestions,0,1.0,False

Anyhow, I‚Äôm a down to earth guy with a pretty good head on my shoulders. 

If we had to meet, I‚Äôd be 15 mins early.

If we had to share a beverage I‚Äôd probably take a coffee two sugar two milk.

If we had to go on a walk, I‚Äôd give you time to express yourself and engage in respectful adult conversation.

I‚Äôm a hopeless romantic, passionate when I feel inclined to get creative.

I enjoy music, in many genres. Heavy metal, alt rock, classic rock, edm and other electronic music, synthwave, grunge, etc.

I‚Äôm an introvert, not much for small talk but can talk about most topics. Any and all questions I will answer to the best of my ability.

Scared? ,"Let‚Äôs call him Peter. Peter and I went out a little over a week ago. He asked me out through dm and we actually go out the next morning, we do some walking at a park and he wants to keep the date going so we go get coffee. Peter tells me on this date that he‚Äôs wanted to reach out to me before about two years ago but he didn‚Äôt have anything to offer and didn‚Äôt wanna waste my time. Peter is from my hometown except he lives in another state now due to work, so he was just here visiting family. 

After our first morning date he becomes very comfortable to call and FaceTime with me to which I don‚Äôt mind because his communication I thought was very nice. He texts me thank you for the nice time and then proceeds to facetime me that same day asking if I‚Äôd like to go grab dinner later. So we have a dinner date and everything goes perfect again. He tells me thank you again for a good time. And FaceTimes/calls me pretty regularly for a few days, I can tell he was trying to make time to see me and reminds me that he definitely wants to see me again before he goes home. 

For some context, Peter is a gentleman, and I can tell he is the type of guy to take things slow , he doesn‚Äôt really talk to anyone and hasn‚Äôt been in a relationship for a few years. He came across sort of shy. One morning, he texts me good morning and that he‚Äôs sorry but he doesn‚Äôt think we should see each other again because he knows he‚Äôd ask to start something. I was disappointed because we definitely hit it off and had a lot in common. I just said that‚Äôs not a bad thing.. but ok. Peter and I are both in our mid twenties btw.

I just respected his choice, i definitely don‚Äôt want to argue with him or beg for him to give us a chance. Now, here he is texting me back a week later saying that he knows it‚Äôs not a bad thing to start something but he didn‚Äôt want to waste my time. (He is back in his home state now) Do I need to make clear to him that I like him?? Or something, I don‚Äôt know whether to reassure him or just tell him ok?

1hyl4w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HubermanLab/comments/1hyl4w3/the_ras_and_being_better/,The RAS and being better,"Hello everyone! Hope you are all having a wonderful day. wherever you may be. My name is J and I work as a fully remote clinical hypnotherapist; in that work, I have observed time and again the effects of a single system when it comes to being better.

Have you heard of the **Reticular Activating System**? If not, this information could change your world. It did mine. You see, the RAS (shortened for the sake of sanity from this point forward) is a physical part of your brain itself that serves several vital functions. For the sake of this conversation, we'll be discussing its most impactful function in our day to day lives: our attentional filter.

All around you there are countless things going on that you're simply filtering out. The noise in the background, that itch you forgot about, etc. Information that is not useful need be filtered out so that your attention can be used on more useful things, or at least what you perceive as useful. What you see, what you don't, what you notice, hear and think are all influenced or directed by the RAS.

What does this mean? To put it bluntly, you decide what you notice in yourself, others and the world around you. If you make the choice that the proverbial lens you put in front of your reality is negative, corrosive or self-defeating... well, your brain will verify all of those things for you to. If you think the world is bad or you are insufficient, then your brain will literally tune itself so that's all you notice that which validates your thinking.

The opposite of that is also true. If you begin to think positively and supportively of yourself, a wild thing will begin to happen: your world around you will begin to validate that thinking via what you notice in that world. By adjusting your attentional filter, you change what you pay attention to. Crazy, I know. Try it, I'll tell you how.

Our most naturally suggestible time of the day is the morning, right after we wake up. You're actually in a state of trance; this is an ideal time to adjust your RAS. I want you to try this: when you wake up, just relax in bed for a bit and think about how good your day is going to be. Find things to get excited about, even if it's just a positive anticipation of your morning coffee. Start your day with the expectation that it will be good and something fascinating will happen... no matter how your day objectively goes, you will view it as more positive.

This isn't just mindset, this is neurology. The brain, not the mind. By recognizing and working with the RAS, we can create incredible changes in our perception. Your reality is plastic, mold it into something that makes you smile.

Of course my caveat to this is that you're going to have terrible managers and co-workers who you just wont mesh with, but when your buddy who is also fed up moves onto a better company, he might think it's worth bringing you along. Or your boss gets a great offer with a better company, he may ask you to join him as well. One of your clients could also have a great opportunity that matches your skillset and passion perfectly and almost all of the time, these will be a step up from where you're at. All of these come from being truly personable and not from the fake salesmen personality that a lot of people will see right through.

I'm still great friends with my first boss/mentor I ever had in sales and kind of hope we cross paths again one day on a bigger stage. There has also been plenty of people I'd be happy to not see ever again, which is okay, because not everyone is going to have your same energy. 

In my eyes, there is no amount of experience that can outweigh a good network of people. I'm sure there are exceptions, but majority of the higher level folks I've met in sales have excelled from their networking skills, rather than hopping jobs every 2 years hoping for the next big thing. Anyone who has been in the profession for a few years understands and this is more for the newer people starting their career. Yes, this is a very individualistic and competitive environment, but always put some effort into making some friends along the way.

","So I have been working on forgiving...and yet here i am again.

i guess 1st: full disclosure. marriage isn't huge for me. commitment, however, is. and some might say marriage the clearest form of that but...in all of our cases...infidelity happens regardless. so. that's my current pessimisms shining through. :)

we have almost been together three years...

been talking about that we are IT for each other pretty much from the beginning...we had some rocky times...i wanted a family, he just wasn't ready to start a family but starting like 5 months ago...we got on the same page and he was and we started talking more seriously about it.

Aside from some rocky moments...our relationship was my favorite.

BUT....three months ago...i found out that he had had multiple emotional affairs and just engaged inappropriately with women. the last one being about 7 months now.

it's been three months. and I just feel so fooled. i'm pretty sure i know everything: no physical infidelity. in his words: he was feeding his own insecurities...being selfish, narcissistic, immature, inconsiderate.

he knows that he ruined our relationship...

he hates that he hurt me. he is trying to show me in all the ways that he knows how...that he cares, that he wants this, that he will never do this again...that he will put our relationship first...etc...

he makes me coffee every morning he does the dishes everyday...in a way he is more considerate, we started going to couples therapy

annnnnnnnnnd...after three months...i am almost over it. here's why:

i don't feel like he actually knows how to be considerate or work through this with me in the way that i need. we are in such a fragile time...and yet he'll still prioritize his hobbies...he will still bring up things that are super triggering for me and then be so surprised when i all the sudden shut down. I'm starting to feel like he actually just doesn't get it, like i don't think it's a matter of how much he loves me or wants to make it work, and at the same time...i feel like if it was as much as he says it is...he would just do the things i need.

admittedly some days are great and then other days, like today, i'm like...this is so fucking stupid. what am i doing trying to salvage this. i don't know when to just like draw the line and say i'm done. And the reason why i don't know when is because i want it to work...but it is so hard...and painful...and comes in waves of rage and then sadness. i guess i'm just tired.

I'm having a really bad time with a guy renovating the upstairs flat. Started about 2 months ago now and for about half the week of every week (excluding the holidays) there's so much noise that I've been forced to relocate my work to the library pretty much on a permanent basis. 

I get that I can't do anything about the noise and I held my tongue for roughly a month, then he flooded my kitchen. Mum dealt with that and they said they'd pay for it to be repaired. Fine.

Few days later they started showing up at 7 or 8am and doing heavy labour work. I tolerated it for most of the day then went round and asked him when he was done for the day and if he could give me an idea of what his work schedule is so I can work around it. He wouldn't and him (and his girlfriend) were generally quite belligerent.

I have severe anxiety issues and ended up in the hospital that night with a panic attack coupled with a chest infection, which was scary (phoned an ambulance but the wait times are insane atm).

About a week or so later I was in the garden sharpening my tools (I work with wood) and the police called to see me. Seems he feels threatened somehow (haven't interacted with him since the one time). Police were just there in a mediation capacity and asked me if there's anything they can do to make the situation better. I asked them if they could get him to communicate to me (note through the door was the suggestion) when they're working upstairs so I can work around it. They asked and he didn't.

That night before he left, he flooded my kitchen again. Mum spoke to the plasterer the morning after and he said he was fucking with the running water when he shouldn't be.

Our kitchen gets repaired.

Holidays pass, and I'm basically living in the library now and have to give up on woodworking because I'm scared he'll call the police on me again if I'm doing anything in my garden. 

He showed up this week after the plastering had dried and resumes work, presumably installing a kitchen. I didn't know he was coming, so I try to work through the noise. Get up to make a coffee at about 3pm and there's a hole in my ceiling. Guy has driven a strut through the ceiling.

Police told me to call them if there were any problems, so I did. Guy comes out to leave for the day and I inform him that the police will be coming to speak with him about the hole he's put in my ceiling. He said he didn't care and they could phone him. He then got quite aggressive and ranted for a while, while holding a crowbar. I backed off before it became a situation. Police didn't come, said it was a civil matter.

Now I'm stuck, because I can't interact with this guy for one reason or another and there's a hole in my ceiling that he's responsible for. I'm not used to dealing with this kind of thing. I've lived here for 25 years in peace. So, I have absolutely no clue what to do now and if it's going to cost me.

I understand I can take him to civil court or whatever and make him pay for it, but I believe it takes a very long time? Are there emotional grounds I can take to speed it up or get him charged with something? Guy has basically ruined my life for 2 months and keeps messing with my house. I feel like I'm under siege here.

Hindi ko rin mapigilan yung galit ko. ,"Problem/Goal: His actions and communication skills are really lacking but I know na wala naman talaga siyang intentions to cheat. Minsan nakukulangan lang ako plus the scenario na magkasama silang dalawa. 

Context: His work requires him to travel to other regions so sometimes nandon yung manager to check with their accounts. I really don't have a problem with it kasi that is for work purposes and I understand that. Pinapakita nya pa yung messages nila and it is purely about work. 

Nagkaroon sila ng christmas party/outing together with their whole company last December. I knew this manager since napag-uusapan namin siya kapag nagtatanong ako about work niya. So ayun na nga, after the outing, nag check ako sa phone niya and then nagulat ako kasi archived na yung conversation na dati hindi naman. It was just a question and it says

Him: Umuwi na kayo?
Manager: Hindi pa, andito pa kami sa place.

After that, I confronted him as to why need itago yung message and he said na ayaw nya raw ako magalit kasi nag chachat sila. He explained bakit nya natanong yun sa manager niya tapos nag away kami and then ff. I let it pass kasi it was just one time and hindi na siya nag archive ulit but the trust is broken. 

Ngayon, they traveled together ulit kasi may need silang gawin for their account and they go to different lodges to sleep. Since may places na malayo and need puntahan, he just rode with her car kasi usually he commutes kapag wala yung manager. I know na may ongoing issue sila with their company kaya nag chichika sila sa nangyayari and he updates me about the issue. 

Whole day sila magkasama and nagchachat naman siya na nakarating na sila or paalis na ganon. Yung place daw is parang bukid and mahirap yung signal that's why he can't keep me posted all the time. Also, he gets car sick kapag gumagamit ng phone while umaandar yung vehicle kaya sleep lang daw siya all throughout the ride. So nag chat na siya na pauwi na sila and they were going to eat dinner. Here's the convo. 

Him: Pa check-in na ako sa place.
Me: Okay.
Him: May chismis si manager about sa issue, sabihan kita pag dating ko sa room.
Me: Sige, can't wait.

After that, he told me na pababa na sana siya but his manager said na may chika pa raw about the issue so pumunta sila sa Bo's Coffee near his place to continue. All this time akala ko umuwi na talaga siya. So from there, nag away ulit kami because hindi naman siya nagpaalam na aalis pa ulit sila. 

Previous Attempts: I got mad with him kasi I felt betrayed since that girl was the reason of our away last time. I asked him to explain and he did. I understand why those things add up to each other. Hindi ko lang talaga maiwasan na magalit and mag isip ng masama.",1,1736558627.0,adviceph,4,1.0,False

1hykjlq,https://i.redd.it/jjwgniazn9ce1.jpeg,I tried 4 Flairs for 5 years AMA,"First I'm grateful for Flair espresso to introduce me to the wonderful espresso at home capability.

I started on 2019 with the pro2 and a 1zxpro manual grinder, I was getting amazing espresso, but noilk drinks ability, there was no solutions to steam milk after trying the frothing gadgets, I purchased a Delonghi beginner machine, and retrofitted the wand to a rancolio Silva wand, very slow pressure but was much better than frothing gadgets.

2 years later I upgraded to first F58, and also the DF64 electric grinder, it was progress! 
I bought all kinds of baskets, gadgets, upgraded my grinder to the HU burrs and got a WPM 220v commercial milk steaming machine based on Andrew rec on the Flair FB group.

The steaming machine( which I still use) was a hot, the F58 with the HU burrs? Not so good, I was grinding at 1 on the DF64, barely having pressure on the 58, which is bc maybey grinder was defective (I alrigned and realigned the burrs), I was able to return it and get the DF64V then the dF64 gen2, and this time I was grinding at 8-9. 
But I was still not satisfied at my espresso compared to the pro2, so I bought a Flair classic, and the espresso quality was much better but I found that I do need to dose my coffee to 19g and classic couldn't handle it.

Finally sold the classic and the Flair 58, purchased the pro2 again. Was briefly excited for the introduction of pro3 till I found out it is also NOT an upgrade and bought a (backup) pro2.

Now I'm happy again. 
Based on my own experience, I wish Flair developed better pro2, maybe with electric heat element, or small boiler, (like Streitman CT2) something in that direction instead of the F58 because the pro2 produced BETTER espresso that the F58 (here, I said it)

Also whiched they worked or collabed on a milk steamer, not the frother, a steamer,nthe WPM is amazing, but it's 220v, needed a transformer and sourcing it was not easy.

Apart from that they have great CS and very easy to maintain machines, which is a very big plus.",7,1736558494.0,FlairEspresso,7,0.89,False

**Background**

I am seeking advice on how to create a realistic and workable family budget. My husband (27M) and I (26F) have 2 young children. Our current approximate household income is 130k. I am in the process of starting my own business (manufacturing a product) but it is rudimentary at this stage. We do not use childcare as I am a stay-at-home mum, eldest child will attend free kindergarten this year.

**Main Expenses**

Rent is $430/week (dual living with a parent temporarily in the hope of saving). We have one car, paying off $156/week. Private health insurance is $66/week. Groceries are becoming very expensive. We probably spend $350/week - even with buying on special, utilising Amazon, home-brand/ALDI etc. We hardly ever eat out but do get coffee as a family a couple of days a week and we want to keep that ritual. I am looking through smaller payments like subscriptions and removing some of those. Saving for a house feels impossible but that is our end goal. Our eldest is starting school next year, which will be $3k/yr in tuition if we decide to go with the local private school (likely).

Any advice on how to approach this is greatly appreciated.",5,1736558060.0,AusFinance,3,1.0,False

Yesterday, I was 3 hours under slept and had 3 strong coffees in the first 2 hours so I could try the new VR goggles(Quest 3). 

I lasted 2 hours and suddenly my left arm starts twitching as if it was replicating my heart beat. I removed the goggles. This immediately spread to my right arm and then my right arm becomes fully locked with all muscles tensed up as I threw myself on the floor.

Managed to call out to my wife for help and heard her coming and asking: ""What's wrong?""

Then I lost consciousness. When I woke up very confused there was a police officer standing next to me and my wife quickly came over to say: ""It's ok.""

In the living room there was also one of my section leaders from work (we live 3 mins away). Because no ambulances were available the police gave us a lift to hospital.

Had to go to A&E and get a battery of tests , bloods, heart, including a brain scan that came back normal.

My legs and hips feels like I did squats for 2 hours. Can barely climb or descend stairs that's how sore they are.

Sure, the being under slept doesn't help nor does the excess coffee as this can lower the threshold for general seizures. But there's plenty of reports online from users getting seizures. 


In the META Quest's safety warning there is this gem...
""Some people (about 1 in 4,000) may have severe dizziness, seizures, eye or muscle twitching, or blackouts triggered by light flashes or patterns. This may occur while they are watching TV, playing video games, or experiencing virtual reality, even if they have never had a seizure or blackout before or have no history of seizures or epilepsy.""

At one point, she shared that she works for herself and builds e-commerce apps; only works a couple of hours a week; left her full time job. Later in the conversation, she described it as drop shipping commodity items like toothpaste (which seems different than building apps). She also shared her husband and her are on a 2-year plan to having him also leave his corporate job, and that her friend taught them how to make passive income from these apps/drop ship commodities.

1hykad4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hykad4,Comparing Nayara Properties: What Stands Out at Each Spot/AMA,"Hi everyone! So looking back on the year of travel I happened to stay at each of the Nayara properties (just fit best for what I was looking for in the locations and availability at the time ) 

Property
I feel like Nayara does a great job of blending into the surrounding and let the scenery do the talking (kind of similar to Tierra in that way)

Nayara Tented Camp (Costa Rica)
The place to be with views of Arenal volcano immersed in the rainforest with private plunge pool heated by the hot springs . Expansive since its connected to nayara springs & gardens but they have the golf carts to take you around . Bonus points for access to all the restaurants , spa and gym which I enjoyed thoroughly.

Nayara Alto Atacama (Chile)
 in the heart of the Atacama Desert truly feels like a quiet serene retreat . Proximity to dunes for biking and hiking was a plus (nature is your gym here)  . Also love the alpacas on property and a lovely spa. 

Nayara Bocas del Toro (Panama)
Literally a tropical paradise on stilts . Secluded private island to take advantage of all the water based activities and explore nearby islands by boat. Gym & spa here are lacking (recommend having spa treatments at your bungalow instead) but I hear they are adding a spa/ gym treehouse with improved facilities 

Nayara Hangaroa (Easter Island, Chile)
On the remote island the property really blends local culture and modern design which I appreciate with views of the pacific. Spa and gym here were decent but not noteworthy. 
Rooms/Villas

Tented Camp: safari type tents with  private plunge pools and outdoor shower (be aware of creepy crawlers haha) spacious interior and comfy canopy bed. 

Alto Atacama: Minimalist, adobe-style rooms that seamlessly blend into the desert landscape, with private patios .

Bocas del Toro: Overwater bungalows with  direct access to the ocean which is the highlight here ! (Also there are treehouses which are beautiful but not the same experience imo) They also give you access to the boat with captain daily if you are interested in exploring nearby islands .  Ask for kayaks or paddle boards .

Hangaroa: had the Maunga suite here which had double height ceilings with volcanic stone accents and views of the coast. Appreciate the mix of modern amenities while honoring the islands heritage . Woke up to wild horses outside my room which was a special moment. 
Activities
Tented Camp: Allll the nature things here !!  Lava field walks, hanging bridges , ziplining, rappelling waterfalls and night walks  . The wildlife spotting here is super interesting (think sloths, toucans , viper snakes)  and if you can get Isidro he is the best guide !! 

Alto Atacama: the array of outdoor activity options here is amazing !! Only way to describe it is otherworldly ., between salt flats, geysers , biking through the canyons, volcano treks, and stargazing (was able to see Saturns rings through the giant telescope on property) also don‚Äôt miss the archaeological site nearby called Pukara de quitor.

Bocas del Toro: alll the Water-based adventures here including snorkeling/ scuba , kayaking through mangroves and exploring nearby islands by boat, all surrounded by crystal-clear waters. Highlight was definitely seeing baby sloths hanging in the mangroves 

Hangaroa: Cultural immersion is the focus here with guided tours to the island‚Äôs iconic moai statues, volcanic craters,  caves,  and ceremonial sites.. feels like visiting a moment stuck in time. don‚Äôt miss sunrise at tongariki, horseback riding to terevaka (the peak of the island with 360 views) , Hanga o tea if you are into trekking it was magical to hike along the untouched coastline along volcanic rock and no people around just horses / cows and moai ofcourse !! Stargazing here was special on the otherside of the island they set up with locals and had music and a fire going with  fish they caught 
Food
Tented Camp: many options here with the different restaurants !! La terrazze has local Costa Rican flavors and they do fresh guacamole in front of you which is a fun touch . Ayla the Mediterranean option was also solid. Highly recommend the tasting menu at Amor loco, was a feast for the senses with flavors from all over Costa Rica . Oh and  for breakfast have it out on your private deck and you can even order things from their coffee spot like smoothies (morning staple )

Alto Atacama: Considering the location here and being secluded in the desert I was pleasantly surprised by the food here .dishes were  Creative and flavorful dishes inspired by the Andes. Breakfast had solid a la carte options (to fuel up before full day excursions) one of the most memorable meals was the 3 course lunch they set up for us Mid hike in the canyons of the rainbow valley !!

Bocas del Toro: tropical laid back type food here. Of all the Nayara properties the food here was lackluster . Breakfasts were meh and dinner was just ok . Nice to sit out and can spot sharks around the dining area which is overwater . We ended up just ordering food to the bungalow some nights when it was pouring rain . 

Hangaroa: Polynesian inspired and focus on seafood here. Breakfast was just buffet but the omelette bar was a nice touch. There is a more fine dining type spot for dinner that is separate from the lunch spot which had elevated dishes. highly recommend The tuna steak here that is locally caught so Fresh as well as the ceviche !! Other than that not much to write home about . 
Overall
Tented Camp for an immersive rainforest active adventure with some relaxation mixed in 

Alto Atacama for peace and quiet, desert exploration and some of the best stargazing

Bocas del Toro  for water based fun and a no frills laid back tropical getaway

Hangaroa for a once in a lifetime chance  to connect with the unique culture and landscapes of Easter Island ( note that 4 nights here felt sufficient & this does feel like a place you only need to visit once)

Each of these offer unforgettable experiences and you can be rest assured that you‚Äôre getting the signature eco-luxury of Nayara properties.. anyway hope this gives somewhat of a helpful overview and I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questions :)

I was diagnosed with ADHD about 3 months ago. First started on Guanfacine, switched to Vyvanse a little over a week ago. When I first took it, I almost cried(as I'm sure most of us did!). It was amazing. Make a pot of coffee? NO PROBLEM! It didn't feel like it was a blood sucking task! Wash my face, brush teeth AND tidy bathroom afterwards? NO THINKING ABOUT IT! Justtt doing it! :)

The intensity wore off after about 3 hours but I was still able to manage things like sorting and doing laundry. Loved it! Couldn't wait to use it for work. However, the next day... nothing like it was!  Symptoms barely improved. :(

Upon extensive researching I've come to discover a lot of ladies report it not working during their monthly lady friend. It was unfortunate because I started it 2 days before that. I'm day 3 on my cycle, tried it again today - I can feel something happening in my body, but it's still not treating my symptoms.

I know there are a LOT of posts here about this, but I just wanted to make one myself! I'm wondering if I should wait longer to try it again(although this weekend I would realllyyy love for it to work for work), or if I should ask provider to up my dosage? I'm on 30mg and she'll take me to 40mg. I'm only hesitating because it worked SO WELL the first day! 

Also, I know everyone's bodies are different, but what diet routine has worked best for you? I tried with a protein shake, with coffee, without - it's all the same. I will say, even before the medication, I never get around to eating until later in the day(around 5pm). So breakfast and lunch are really hard for me!

1hyk7f5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystoryemporium/comments/1hyk7f5/my_house_keeps_moving_when_im_asleep_part_1/,My house keeps moving when I'm asleep (part 1),"Last week I noticed something strange, when I woke up from an abnormally long sleep my house wasn‚Äôt where it was supposed to be. I live in the suburbs of salt lake city Utah in a house that‚Äôs pretty old but for some reason when I woke up that day my house was in a field.

A wheat field that seemed to stretch endlessly to the horizon. I couldn‚Äôt tell if I was dreaming or not so I just got in bed and closed my eyes. The next thing I knew my house was back where it was supposed to be.

Though that wasn‚Äôt the last time this happened. About two days later things started to feel off. Everything felt like a dream, as if nothing was real and it was all in my head. But no matter what I did I couldn‚Äôt get rid of the feeling.

Yesterday I noticed that all the plants outside were gone. I looked at doorbell camera footage suspecting they were stolen but from what I saw the plants were never there to begin with. I texted my wife who planted said plants but she claimed she has never brought a plant in or around the house since we moved in.

I called my dad asking him about the plants but he said the same thing. I think im starting to go crazy or something because I could have sworn there was two pots in front of the house with some orange and red flowers and a tree out front. In fact now it seemed that my house was the only one without a tree on the property.

Anyways I have decided to write things down and post them online or where ever I put this for now this Is just a note to myself written on a word document.

I got out of bed this morning and had a donut and coffee for breakfast. My wife leaves for her work earlier than me. It makes the mornings peaceful and quiet. But sometimes, especially times like this it makes me feel quite lonely. When I walked out the front door I looked across the street to see my neighbors didn‚Äôt have and trees or bushes. As I turned my head and looked down the street I realized no one had any bushes or trees. Everyone gardens were empty patches of dirt bricks laid in circles around nothing.

A feeling of uneasiness filled me but I decided to worry because it was probably just a dream. I debated whether or not I should still go to work or take the day off. As I stood on my front porch it hit me, if I was dreaming I could wake myself up or at least become lucid. I did everything I could but nothing seemed to work. I walked inside and went to lay down for a bit when I hit my hip on the counter ‚Äú*FUCK‚Äù*¬†I shouted out loud.

The sharp agonizing pain or bumping into a marble corner was indescribable it hurt a million times worse than it should have. I looked at my hip and noticed I was bleeding. It wasn‚Äôt bad just a small cut but it still hurt enough for me to call it quits for the day.

When I pulled out my phone to call in sick I couldn‚Äôt find my bosses contact. And I couldn‚Äôt remember his number, and for some strange reason I couldn‚Äôt remember his name or hers i completely forgot what they looked like what they sounded like. And then I couldn‚Äôt remember where I worked.

I sat down trying to think but I started to question if I even had a job. Nothing felt real and I had no idea what was happening.

I think I just need to get some sleep.

I woke up to loud bang.

I jumped out of bed dazed and confused I was sweating and I couldn‚Äôt remember what I was doing asleep so late until I saw my laptop open beside me. I heard footsteps that crept closer to the door. ‚ÄúWHO ARE YOU‚Äù I shouted the bedroom door swung open and I saw my wife. ‚ÄúYour home? This early?‚Äù I asked ‚Äúits seven, I‚Äôm late.‚Äù ‚Äúoh shit its seven but that doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I feel like just two minutes ago I was going to go to work but then some weird stuff happened, and speaking of that I need to tell yo‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúwork? You got a job?‚Äù

‚Äúwhat do you mean you got a job?‚Äù

‚Äúyou said you were going to work why didn‚Äôt you tell me that you got a job?‚Äù

‚Äúfor us silly.‚Äù

Her voice sounded strange. Monotone and lacking any emotion at all

‚Äúwhile I‚Äôm gone you should really go sleep‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, What do you mean for us?‚Äù

‚Äúfor our dog its hungry‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a dog‚Äù

She looked at me with a blank stare and said

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what your talking about he‚Äôs right outside.‚Äù

I turned around and looked out the back door and saw a small sheep dog running around on a yard full of dirt I couldn‚Äôt remember if there was grass in the backyard and then I started to remember having a dog.

I looked back at my wife and I couldn‚Äôt seem to fully recognize her. Her face felt off. I could recognize her voice even the strange way she was talking to me but her face I just couldn‚Äôt remember even when looking directly at her. I made myself dinner and went to my bed but my wife never came to join. I shouted her name a few times until I forgot what her name was. It was like I had been shouting gibberish I got out of bed and felt lost.

I walked around the dark house that now felt like I different world and couldn‚Äôt find my wife but then it hit me a realization, a fear. I was alone. And I never had a wife. I keep reading this over and over and over again but I cant remember anything I didn‚Äôt type in the last five minuets.

I‚Äôm losing my mind.

I have decided to just go to sleep and figure things out in the morning.

I woke up around 3 ish in the morning I was cold so I got up to turn on the heater but when I looked outside I saw a forest I ran to every window in the house to be met with the same sight. A pitch black forest, one of those it eats you alive forests. I couldn‚Äôt believe what my eyes were seeing I decided to go back to sleep and pray that this was just some weird dream but as I was getting in bed I saw a not on my nightstand it read ‚Äú*don‚Äôt talk to them, don‚Äôt listen to them, don't look at them and never leave the house.‚Äù*",2,1736557477.0,scarystoryemporium,0,1.0,False

","Hey there! I‚Äôm a 37-year-old Midwestern guy‚Äî5‚Äô11‚Äù, fit, and told I‚Äôm easy on the eyes (but I‚Äôll let you be the judge). I thrive on humor, adventure, and living life with intention.

After serving in the military, I worked hard to create a stable, fulfilling, and financially secure life. Now, I‚Äôm ready for the next chapter: settling down, and starting a family to share in all the joys (and, let‚Äôs be real, a little chaos) that come with it.

I don‚Äôt smoke or do drugs, but I‚Äôm always up for a great cup of coffee, a well-made drink, or an active day outdoors. Summers are my time to soak up life on the water, but come winter, work tends to keep me busy. Whether I‚Äôm scuba diving, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or tackling a DIY project (I solo-renovated my house), I like to stay productive and embrace life. Family is at the heart of who I am, and I‚Äôm excited to build a future filled with love, laughter, and meaningful experiences.

I‚Äôm looking for a kind, grounded, and emotionally steady partner‚Äîideally in her 20s or early 30s‚Äîwho shares my values and is also ready to build a life together.

1hyk432,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1hyk432/professional_dominatrix_4/,Professional Dominatrix (4),"Despite being in this business for many years, Deanna was shocked at the visceral sounds coming out of the closed room. A man was horrifically screaming at the top of his lungs, accompanied by a rhythmic rattling of the bed frame. Walking past the room, she continued to awkwardly walk down the staircase in her latex catsuit and dangerously high heels. Going into the break room, she sat down at the table with a half-naked Ashley wearing a bodice straining to cover her body.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is Vanessa doing up there?‚Äù Deanna wondered as they sipped their coffee, mentally tuning out the commotion from upstairs.

‚ÄúAs she was getting ready, I saw her wearing a huge strap on,‚Äù Ashley revealed. ‚ÄúIt looked kind of funny, actually.‚Äù

Deanna nodded knowingly, imagining a cartoonishly large dildo attached to Vanessa‚Äôs petite frame. ‚ÄúAh, ok. Sometimes I think she enjoys that a little too much.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw you talking with Adam the other day. It seemed pretty intense.‚Äù

Deanna went on to explain their new arrangement together.

‚ÄúAnother paypig?‚Äù Ashley wondered incredulously. ‚ÄúThose guys always flake. You know that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, but I get a different vibe from Adam. And plus, we already know each other. I know he won‚Äôt bail on me,‚Äù Deanna tried to explain. ‚ÄúThis is actually all new for him, so he probably doesn‚Äôt have any expectations.‚Äù

Ashley responded with a dubious expression. She then frowned as she reminded Deanna about her own rules. ‚ÄúI thought you always told us not to pursue personal relationships with clients.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm the boss so I can do whatever I want,‚Äù Deanna playfully stated. ‚ÄúBesides, Adam only ever sees me. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm stealing him from anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo can I do the same?‚Äù Ashley cautiously asked.

Deanna sighed and relented. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs a client that‚Äôs exclusive to you, then I suppose it‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

Ashley giddily clapped.

‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt tell the other girls about this.‚Äù

\*\*\*\*\*

On the second Friday of their new arrangement, Deanna received $100 a few minutes before noon. Smiling, she was glad the first time was not a fluke. After an hour, she contacted him for the first time since they were previously together nearly two weeks ago.

Deanna: *‚ÄúCongratulations on making it to two weeks.‚Äù*

Adam: *‚ÄúThank you, Miss Deanna.‚Äù*

Deanna: *‚ÄúNow that I know you‚Äôre serious, we need to talk some more.‚Äù*

Adam: *‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù*

Deanna: *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything about your financial situation. Let‚Äôs make sure we‚Äôre doing this responsibly. Send me screen shots of your bank accounts and pay stubs. You can censor the sensitive info. Then we can go from there.‚Äù*

As her long-time client, she had a fair idea of his financial standing since her rates weren‚Äôt cheap. However, she seized the opportunity to gather more information.

Adam: *‚ÄúYes, Miss Deanna.‚Äù*

Deanna: *‚ÄúI expect it within the hour.‚Äù*

\*\*\*\*\*

Deanna: *‚ÄúI see you have an appointment at 1:00. Come early and join me for lunch at 12:00.‚Äù*

Adam: *‚ÄúHi, Miss Deanna. Yes, of course!‚Äù*

Deanna: *‚ÄúMeet me at that small Japanese restaurant across the street from my place.‚Äù*

A couple hours later as Deanna approached the restaurant, she saw Adam was already there waiting.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù she greeted him and smiled.

‚ÄúHello Miss Deanna,‚Äù he replied.

She held up her hand to him. ‚ÄúActually, when we‚Äôre out in public just call me Deanna.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. It‚Äôs become a new habit now,‚Äù he explained.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good.‚Äù

In the middle of their lunch, she revealed the real reason she wanted to see him. ‚ÄúI was looking over the screen shots you sent me the other day. Those are impressive numbers.‚Äù

He nodded shyly in response. They went on to discuss in more detail about his income and expenses.

‚ÄúSo, if I told you to pay me $300 a week, it still wouldn‚Äôt be a hardship, would it?‚Äù She let that implication linger as she enjoyed watching him squirm.

‚ÄúMiss‚Ä¶I mean, Deanna‚Ä¶‚Äù he stammered, clearly frightened at what might come.

‚ÄúRelax, I‚Äôm not going to change anything‚Ä¶yet,‚Äù she said, playfully messing with his mind. ‚ÄúBut you will pay for lunch.‚Äù",3,1736557204.0,paypigsupportgroup,1,1.0,False

Here's the thing, I'm honestly not that big of a coffee guy. I think i'll fill up the moka pot bucket half way with coffee every other day and then make it a milk drink by adding hot milk to it afterwards. I'm not a big coffee guy which is why I just bought the moka pot. I think it's simple for a great drink and there isn't a massive process behind it if I don't want there to be one, if that makes sense.

I recently saw that the coffee I use (the Illy brand) will lose it's freshness after a week. Is there some sort of container that I can use to help with the longevity? I don't use a lot of coffee and the illy coffee that I use is great but expensive.

I want to get the most out of my coffee and I want to make sure I brew it the best that I can using the moka pot. I think that the ground coffee may be an area that I may need to focus on more but I am not sure whether I need to or not.

I am (dreadfully) finishing a bag of Ethiopian Washed Medium-Light roast coffee from a local roaster - Hatch.

The beans in question are called Starlight which are supposed to offer a Floral, Stonefruit, Citrus note.

Now, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a taste preference, and I don‚Äôt want to insult the roaster, nor is it my intention to do so - but I don‚Äôt know if this is just a subpar coffee, poor lot, or my technique.

I‚Äôve tried every permutation I can think of a different pours: 4:6, 5 pour, Lance Hendricks method, different t bloom times.

Tried a Kasuya V60 (slower drawdown), regular V60, Origami (basically a V60) and different ratios between 15:1 and 17:1.

Also tried Hario Switch with Hoffmans recipe. 

Tried different grinds on my ZP6 and K Ultra, different water temperatures from 94 to 96, and now‚Ä¶. Well, out of ideas.

Drawdowns between 2:45 and 3:45

The coffee just does not taste appealing or good - it‚Äôs hollow, has an unpleasant sour note that‚Äôs masquerading behind some hollow flavours, and - well, that‚Äôs about it.

Also tried TWW in half and full strength.

I get consistent cups, just very unpleasant flavours.

Does anyone have any pointers?

Hi, I'm a 35 year-old nerdy guy living in New England. And yes, I made a dating site for myself.

I enjoy conventions, video games, cosplaying, etc. Outside of my cosplay I have a great taste in fashion. I also like to work out to keep in shape and stay healthy. In my spare time I fill out sweepstakes and enter raffles (that I often win!).

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay(not required), geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.
