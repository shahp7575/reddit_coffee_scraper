We bumped into each other at a coffee shop , and we ended up talking for hours like no time had passed. The weird part? She’s now engaged.

Now she’s messaging me like nothing happened, saying she’s still going ahead with the wedding, but wants to “keep talking.”

I don’t know what I expected, but I feel… guilty? Confused? A little used?

It always comes out bitter no matter what recipe I use. I usually use Hoffman's 5 pour method and I played around with Lance's too. I do believe I can make a nice cup and adjust my coffee to grind sizes but lately I lost my confidence because no matter how I do it my coffee tastes bitter and harsh. Not too much to ruin my coffee but I know that there's a lot more in those beans than I achieve. I can feel it. 

I use light roasts and I tried grinding finer because it usually makes it more acidic and fixes it but now it's like I didn't even touched the grinder. The results in taste are the same as the first try. So I'm afraid that my Baratza Encore needs new knives.

So I like my coffee black, no sugar and usually dark roasts. I have a French Press and usually use Blue Tokai/Starbucks/KC Roasters/Araku beans, and have them send the French Press Grind.

While I am happy with it, there is an itch to try something new. I was contemplating between Pour Over or Moka Pot. I have read Moka Pot works better with dark roasts while pour overs do better with lighter roasts. I have grown to like the French Press, so I was wondering what would be an improvement in test profile over it. Also read that Moka Pot is unforgiving when it comes to technique. 

I usually have just one cup of coffee a day and only one in family who has it. So if I do change, I need something that is not significant time commitment compared to French Press.

Any recos would be appreciated as to what would have a similar taste profile. Any recos on what kind of equipment I would need would help as well. Not looking for anything very fancy, just an itch to experiment. ",1,1749139888.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

TBH, Wala po akong tinapos na mother notes ni isa sa mga subject. It is very difficult for me to finish 50+ per subject na notes and kahit na pinilit ko before useless parin kasi di ko rin maalala. Kaya ang ginawa ko ay everyday present talaga ako sa review center and hindi talaga ako na tutulog sa klase kaya every day umiinom talaga ako ng coffee for me to wake up. If ever na  di ko na talaga kaya ang antok I would wait sa part ng subject na medyo may konting knowledge ako and don mag pa-power nap. Every night din when I feel like inantok ako I would just listen to a record lecture sa subject na feel ko pakinggan (parang podcast lol) until na nakatulog . More on auditory kasi ako than reading. 

One month before the boards. Final Coaching and practice sa testmanship (review questions) nalang ang ginawa ko. I made a plan na one month before regardless kung nabasa ko ang mother notes or wala. I need to prepare on how I answer the exam. Tricky ang exam so kahit memorize mo yung steps, morse and double negatives will be your downfall. Focus on how they twist the question. And kung may na hihirapan ako sa review exam I would just go back and read my  final coaching kahit once  per subject and take note. Since na gagandahan ako sa final coaching na notes don ko pa naisipan basahin. You’ll likely to remember more kasi ginusto mo talaga mag-aral.


No pamahiin just prayer, ito talaga ang nakakatulong sakin pumasa. 1% knowledge and 99% prayer. So to august takers. find your own ways of studying not to burn out and find your pace. I know and I pray that you will celebrate your Christmas with a RMT at the end of your name.

1l42zud,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1l42zud/constant_frustration_despite_occasional_sex/,Constant frustration despite occasional sex,"Almost feel bad posting this because I realize some people have it SO much worse, but I'm so sexually frustrated.

What it comes down to is that I (m47) only ever get sexual intimacy from my wife (f40) when I initiate it. We have been together for 20 years and it just keeps getting worse. It's always her doing me some big favor, even though the entire act always involves me doing everything I can to get her off and she basically orgasms every time (mostly because of also using her magic wand).

We have no kids, both work good jobs, and are basically both relatively attractive. I admit I have a REALLY high sex drive. I wake up super horny every morning and Ideally like to at least jerk off or otherwise get off first thing in the morning. Im often turned on during the day and would also like sex week nights. Nope. Basically I can pretty regularly get her to give me some time on a Saturday or Sunday morning but again it's always her doing me a huge favor.

To make it worse, we have several dogs and a cat. She spends hours... time before and after work... babying our animals. Baby talk, petting, giving treats, they are so cute so perfect on and on. Dont get me wrong I love them too, a lot. But sometimes it hurts... like if  could get 1/5th of the attention or affection our animals get Id probably be satisfied.

Before I get blamed ... more background... I do a huge amount of the chores in the house ... dishes cleaning all the yard work etc... Definitely my fair share. I make her coffee every morning and send texts when she's at work like ""hey beautiful hope you are having a good day"" etc. Mostly she doesn't respond because ""she's busy'

When ever I try to initiate sex it always ""Im not in the mood... or you have to do more to foreplay me'... except even if I take her on a date night or make her a drink, or give her a massage or flirt or kiss its never enough. She regularly gets upper back pain and I will give a full ten minute back massage like 3 times a week but that earns nothing.

This morning she is getting ready to go see a gf for like 4 days and has the day off.  A lot of times she leaves for work before me and I will jerk off just to get a release before work.  She came in and sat next to me on the couch... we snuggled for a while... I massaged her back and rubbed her tits but could kind of tell she wasn't into it... I had an erection and just asked her to rub my dick for a few minutes. Nope. She's not in the mood. Ok no release this morning. The lack of sexual intimacy as a need for me does not register to her at all.

I swear the effort it takes me to deep massage her back is 20x harder than it would be for her to just jerk me off for 3 minutes but nope. Asking too much. At least when she's gone I can get myself off... 

We have had discussions about this. I have explained that sexual intimacy is important to me. She turns it around thay I don't spend enough time with her sister and her sisters kids. So I have done a bunch more of that. Still no change for me though.

I'm not a bad looking guy Im fit and pretty built for my age. There are definitely females who seem interested in me. I have so much desire... and I try and try to direct it to my wife but it just rarely pans out no matter I do. I just want to feel desired back... to me that feeling of wanting and being wanted is so great. I miss it. 

I don't know there is no answer I guess... i could get divorced (which sometimes I consider) but honestly I live in a pretty small town idk the odds of actually finding a woman who is interested in regular sex seem low. I do still get attention from younger women but Im sure that will fade away as I continue to age.

Just so frustrated this whole society where sex is taboo and men are called misogynistic for having desire. I am a good guy, a nice guy, a caring person. I just am so unfulfilled watching myself get older and older and I already know that being sexually unfulfilled will be a major regret of how I lived my life.

A conversation which went for more than 6 hours, which made us discuss our struggles, our pain, our miseries, our successes, our love for India from our perspective, communism, capitalism, class warfare, love, lust and what not? 

We both couldn't believe it was our first meeting. It was like two old friends from school, yet we were decades apart. He ordered me to not to put him as a character in my stories. I promised him, that i will never a write a story about him. Today, i changed my mind, so i called him.

Who is this?

Has she left?

 She will, in two months. 

How do you know?

 Mmm . Don't create memories with her.

 I will, but no scotch.

You know what? 

What?

 I like you. 

I like you too. 

dSo what is the name of our story? 

A conversation between coffee and scotch.

He didn't say anything and after few seconds, he laughed heartily and then in his majestic voice, make it as ""black"" coffee . And he continued his laugh.

I clapped my hands once he fell back and he said he’d be waiting for me outside until I got off, along with a diatribe of violent threats. He kept saying stuff like “I’ll be waiting, and the minute you come from around that counter I’ll be here pussy” 

I felt unsafe at this point and went into the back. My manager came and got me about 15 minutes and told me it wasn’t a big deal because the guy was “a dopefiend”, and that I should just keep working and not worry about it. They also refunded his money as well as gave him free coffee even after he was screaming and acting like he was jumping the counter, and threatening multiple employees, not just me.

I left with a container of hot oil in my hands so I could splash him if he tried to follow through on his threats. I have seen this dude at our location pretty much daily, and my manager ended up giving him his coffee as well as his money back and a huge apology.

15 Days off Caffeine. 29, female. 
Been drinking coffee since I was 11 or a little younger. About 8 cups a day, sometimes a little less, sometimes a little more. Never took a break except for a couple days if sick, or tried quitting and only made it 3 days or so. 

Pros: 
1. Can focus on work and not feel like a whirling dervish. 
2. Am reading books again (I could never focus or sit down long enough to do so, gave up reading back in middle school). 
3. I'm more honest with my time management (I don't think I can accomplish my life goals in like ... An hour). 
4. More peaceful. 
5. I am honest with my feelings faster (I used to not be able to feel, and then shove things aside, blow up later at myself and not deal with my relationships honestly). 


BUT! 

The Cons: 

1. No sex drive. None. Gone. Super nervous about this (I just got it back after several years of lack and pain. See below!). 
2. I tolerate less noise/people/interactions. My patience whittled down.
3. Tired, tired, tired. Getting up feels awful. 
4. Digestion is sad. Coffee was my laxative, it might appear. I am supplementing with digestive enzymes and magnesium, but it isn't helping as much as I thought it would. 
5. Headaches still a-happenin'.
6. It feels like low-level depression, but I am not enthused or happy about much of anything. 

Random not pro or con things, just life that could influence this: 
I have a chronic illness, that is still being figured out. Many doctors, specialists, er visits and a surgery, and we're still here with not a whole lot of answers. 

Would love some honesty about this. Do these cons improve? Anything I should be doing to make these symptoms disappear faster? Am I ""normal"" now?

1l42rh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1l42rh1/the_who_date_guy_vs_cuddles_guy/,The Who: Date Guy vs Cuddles Guy,"Problem/Goal: I feel conflicted that I want to go and meet with a guy who wants to talk and cuddle even when I’ve been on a few dates with someone for the past 2 months. 

Context: A guy who I used to talk to online last year resurfaced and was around the city so we met for the first time earlier today. We only had coffee and a wholesome conversation inside my car. Plus, we held hands. But everything else was again, ✨wholesome✨. However, before this, I have been unofficially dating a guy for almost 2 months now. Unofficially meaning we haven’t talked about exclusivity yet. I was initially apprehensive of meeting someone else in the first place because of this, but then again, I also don’t wanna close my doors just yet. Considering that nothing’s clear with the other guy yet, even when I’ve told him to ligaw if he’s serious. I also see that his followings is still growing so I’m assuming that he’s still actively swiping. 

Now, I’m not sure if I should ask the guy I’m dating if we’re going to be exclusive. Coz if we are, I know for a fact that I’m gonna choose him. 

On the other hand, I did enjoy talking with cuddles guy and am interested in seeing him again.

Previous attempts: I used to talk to cuddles guy last year until I eventually dated someone and got serious with that guy (which eventually didn’t work out), so I dropped cuddles guy and never got the chance to meet with him (he’s based abroad) last year even when he kept trying to convince me. He was respectful of my decisions and boundaries too, even when we met earlier. 

However, I know that cuddles guy has no intention of offering me something for the long-term. And if things eventually get serious with date guy, I’m not sure if this would be a problem for us, when we don’t even have a commitment right now. ",1,1749138890.0,adviceph,4,1.0,False

I'll start by thanking the contributors, of both posts and comments, in this community for the volumes of information, perspectives, suggestions and critiques that informed my recent purchase decision.  That goes also for the Philos owners and fans out there who influenced my grinder decision (after a lot of research and handwringing).

In 2006 we went to Italy and that's where I first ""caught the bug"".  I drank a lot of cappuccinos on that trip, and after returning home (to Canada) I started looking into buying my first espresso machine, which ended up being the Swiss-made Solis SL-70.  I had that indestructible tank for 11 years.  It was replaced with a Gaggia Classic.  After 4 years I replaced that with a Rancilio Silvia which I also had for 4 years.

I was well down the road of buying an ECM Mechanika Max.  But I happened onto a Reddit thread about La Marzocco, a brand I hadn't considered, primarily because of price.  However, once I fell down the LM rabbit hole that most of you reading this likely tripped into as well, I knew it was the right decision for me.

I chose the grey (silver) Micra as I was done with constantly faffing around keeping the watermarks, coffeespritz, and fingerprints off my previous stainless steel machines.  The soft grey/white finish is both visually appealing and super easy to keep clean.  Am very much enjoying the ""repeatability"" factor as well as the simplicity.  Perhaps I'm not the only LM/Mazzer owner who just enjoys looking at his new tools?

I purchased both from a Canadian retailer and had a stellar experience.  They also have a trade-in program which I also took advantage of.  (They took my Rancilio Silvia and Breville Smart Grinder Pro - both of which were in near pristine condition, and offered a reasonable rebate against the price of the Micra and Philos).  The customer service from this retailed (iDrinkCoffee.com) was something from a bye-gone era.  Seriously next-level service...

If you've read this far, thank you - and here are two questions:

1. Are you using the provided tamper with the Micra?  I've found it works well, likely because of the slightly concave base which guides water into the centre of the puck.  If you're using something else, what is your tamper of choice?
2. Do you turn your machine On/Off as needed?  Or, do you allow your machine to go into ""sleep"" mode and then control it with the app when you want to turn it on?",2,1749138831.0,LaMarzocco,0,1.0,False

One thing I see for this recipe, is that each step requires 45 seconds between pours. My drawdown times (including pour time) is about 30 seconds though, so i end up with a dry bed for about 15 before the next step is supposed to start.

Should I be waiting the whole 45 seconds? 
Should I be pouring next step once water is 1cm above bed?

She dumped me. No big arguement, no falling out… just separation with an agreement to remain friends and see what happens. 

I’ve mentally dragged myself over coals the last 6 weeks. We’ve been talking, mostly superficially though. Saw each other twice, for work reasons (client/worker situation). And every interaction left me wanting more… it just got to the point that I felt I was being breadcrumbed….

Tonight I asked if she would like to see each other for coffee, didn’t stipulate a time but she replied saying she’s busy…. Which I know she is in life in general, but there’s busy and there’s busy… I told her the current situation wasn’t working for me, feels like forced friendship etc and that I need to take some space. She exchanged niceties (she seemed very genuine), said she’d happily remain as is but gets it if I didn’t want to, and so on. I’m not sure if she was surprised with me calling it or what. 

…..

I don’t feel any better. Maybe there’s hope, probably not. To think this person will never be apart of my life again hurts. We had amazing times…. By the end we fell into a rhythm of having small fights regularly, and I told her that I feel like we need this breakup to reset our cycle, but I couldn’t remain cyber friends only….. 

I’m sure long term it’s the right decision, regardless of how things pan out. But right now it doesn’t feel that way at all…

I’d especially love recommendations for:
- Nightlife, favorite wine bars/breweries, any clubs (I know that’s unlikely), fun places to meet young people!!!!!
- Trivia nights, live music, film showings, game nights 
- Coffee shops, brunch spots, and local restaurants
- Farmers markets, art festivals, museums, fun 
things to do during the day on the weekends
- Favorite outdoor spaces to hangout, walk, or study at

1l42l72,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1l42l72/how_do_i_get_my_aging_dad_to_drink_water/,How do I get my aging dad to drink water?,"My 81 year old dad still lives independently and is doing relatively well for his age. But lately his condition has been declining. I stayed with him for a week to see if I could pinpoint what was going on and realized that he isn't sleeping much due to intense leg cramps at night from dehydration. He doesn't drink at all during the days. No water.

When asked about this, he says that he just ""Doesn't like drinking water"" and was still declining water when offered to him. It's like he's suddenly become hydrophobic out of nowhere.

I've offered him flavored waters and teas and he's not interested. He has a Stanley cup. I tried suggesting he just force himself to drink every time his medication alarms go off (he dry swallows his meds). He sort of agrees but then doesn't do any of it. 

He will drink a little coffee in the mornings (but obviously that's not helping) and he will drink his standard glass of wine at night (also not helping) so it's not that swallowing is painful for him. No change in food appetite.

He doesn't seem to have any major memory issues or behavioral changes. His GP just shrugged and told him to drink more water (so helpful!).

I did some reading that thirst signals can get confused in the brain when you age. But he not only does not appear to experience thirst, he actively dislikes drinking water.

Anybody have any ideas what's going on here or any creative solutions to incentivize water drinking? I'm a bit at a loss and obviously this isn't sustainable.

My roommate is someone that I knew a little before, introduced by another friend.

We have been trying to furnish the flat so I have voluntarily take care of the sofa, vacuum, and coffee table etc. She's a little passive so I told her if she could take on dining table and chairs, that would be perfect.

She's taking a really long time to find dining table and chairs. I would send her a message about some nice sets and she would ignore that specific message or just never respond to them. Never brings it up also if she has found anything or even asking budget she's just ignoring all that messages.

Long story short, I ended up getting them as well (well tbf my fault for being not patient enough). She initially asked whether she can contribute in some kind of way, and told her that if she wants she can contribute in the fees of of renting the van etc. She agreed to that.

Picked up the table with another friend as she was feeling under the weather. And when I asked her to pay the fees of the van, after some thinks she told me that she's not cool with paying the van becus the table with and chairs will be mine anw. And she will get other things (but there isn't really anything to buy as all is done). I still think it's best that at least she covered half of the delivery fees as she's going to use the table afterall.

It is technically a fair point that she won't own the dining table and chairs. Is that a reasonable request or am I just being petty? What would you do moving forward",2,1749138459.0,badroommates,2,1.0,False

1l42jpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalaffair/comments/1l42jpz/i_believe_my_husband_is_having_an_emotional/,I believe my husband is having an emotional affair but I'm not sure what to do.,"A few months back, my husband hired a married female to be a director at his job where he is also a director. He spoke highly of her, which is nothing new as I know he enjoys working with high performers who will make his job easier. They are the same age, so while he is technically her boss, there is a level of equality and friendliness to their relationship. He is not someone who has ever had female friendships, only friendship with other males. Any female relationship he has had outside of ours has strictly been work related, until now.

In the beginning when he hired her, she was very friendly and what i'd call an ""open book"". Never having been close to another female coworker, he expressed his discomfort to me about how to interact with her, and I was open and trusting. I told him ""past female coworkers have had weird intentions, so it's normal for you to have your guard up."" I even suggested that her and I try to become friends to make it less weird, so he gave her my number and we texted about making a plan to get brunch, just us girls. The plans never happened though, due to busy schedules with work and travel.

Around the time I tried to make plans to meet her, he wouldn't stop talking about her. It got kind of weird, so I asked him to not talk about her so much because it was exhausting and frankly annoying. As his wife, I don't necessarily want to hear him talking about another woman all the time. From that point, he didn't really bring her up at all unless it was work related and I asked. But I noticed some changes in his behavior that started making me feel anxious. He was becoming emotionally distant, and making it clear he wanted more time alone than he did with me. We were hardly having any real conversation at one point, just sort of going through the motions quietly, because when I'd say anything he'd quickly get irritated and speak out of frustration. At first I contributed this to the stress of his job (he worked 10 days in a row) and the fact that we've downsized our home to a tiny apartment and basically live on top of each other now. I recognized he never gets time to himself, since he just goes to work all day and then comes home to me. I did my best to respect this and give him some space, although I still felt hurt and rejected.

Then the time came for me to leave for a work trip, and this is where I started to really feel concerned something was off. I was gone for 5 days and we hardly spoke at all via text or phone call. He almost didn't text me at all and when I'd call he'd ignore it, so I stopped trying for the remainder of the trip. When I got home, he was still emotionally distant, defensive any time I spoke and just seemed cold. He  finally told me that he doesn't like when I leave that I maximize time with him just before I go, then come home and try to maximize time with him again. I guess it stressed him out because he feels like i am constantly trying to get him to do things he doesn't want to do. To me, I just really love spending time with him and wanted to reconnect when I returned home because we've felt distant lately. The more distant we feel, the more I just want to feel close.

So, last night I woke up in the middle of the night, and I noticed his phone had made it's way over to my side of the bed underneath me. While I don't feel good about invading his privacy, I wanted to know if what I'd been feeling about his coworker was valid or just my imagination and anxiety running wild, and what I saw basically confirmed my suspicions.

I opened their texts and scrolled to the very beginning where she said ""I wanted to hold your hand"" and his response was ""how sweet of you."" It was also clear he had deleted messages prior to this, which makes me feel worse. She was short with him after and he asked her ""why are you being weird"" to which she replied ""You literally said yesterday 'when \_\_\_ get's back, we can't talk 24/7 and call each other and text.' So I asked you, 'is \_\_\_\_ home?' You answered 'yeah'. I'm like okay well I want him to know I'm thinking of him or something cute since we didn't talk today, that is when I texted you about holding hands. So I was trying to respect your space but still know I see you."" I scrolled down further and saw more about how he cares about her, she cares about him, and how they just want to feel like they can be ""us"" rather than a boss/employee relationship. I also saw him say something to the effect of ""I think if we had a casual meet up it would make you feel more comfortable about the relationship"" and he sent a coffee emoji. She responded with ""you're literally playing games"" and eventually said ""give me time.""

This morning I brought her up innocently, asking ""why do you think she never reached back out to reschedule our plans?"" and he was mostly silent and said ""I don't know, but I think she's dealing with a lot."" In the few months they've worked together, she has a miscarriage and lost her mother. I know she was (and may still be) in a vulnerable place, and I know he wanted to be friendly to her during that time. But I didn't expect them to be talking about holding hands or texting and calling ""24/7.""

Basically what I saw sounded flirtatious and concerning, but I don't have any evidence of a physical affair. It's almost like he genuinely doesn't know how to be friends with a female who is also his coworker without crossing some emotional line, since he's never had real female friends before. I don't think they'd go so far as to have any sort of physical relationship, but regardless I'm concerned especially because I know prior messages were deleted. I'd love advice on how to move forward. Part of me wants to wait a bit and snoop again and see if I find anything else more concrete or see if it dies off (yes, I know that's toxic). Part of me wants to ignore it. Another part of me wants to bring it up, but I'm terrified if I confront him it will blow up our marriage and the only romantic relationship I've know for half my life. Either way I feel like my decision will change the course of our marriage. I don't know what to do or what to think.",5,1749138378.0,emotionalaffair,3,1.0,False

You can just tell when someone’s trying too hard to get you to say yes. I’m not a sales person by background. I actually started as a doctor and somehow ended up a founder, which means I had to figure out how to pitch to all kinds of people: clients, investors, even strangers online.

Here’s what’s actually helped me and doesn’t make people cringe

Start with a problem, not your product  
Nobody really cares about your service right away. They care about whatever’s bugging them. So instead of saying “Hey, I do lead gen,” I’ll go with something like “I’ve noticed a lot of founders are struggling to get demos. I had the same problem and found a weird fix.” Now it feels like a conversation instead of a sales call.

Drop the pitch voice  
That weird “elevator pitch” tone? Just let it go. Talk like a normal person. If you wouldn’t say it to a friend over coffee, maybe don’t say it in your pitch.

Ask before you share  
This one’s big. Just a simple “Would it be cool if I shared something that worked for me?” Most people say yes, and now they’re actually open to hearing what you have to say.

Let them talk themselves into it  
I like to end with a question, like “Does that sound useful to you?” or “Think that could help in your case?” People enjoy figuring out how something fits into their own life.

Bonus: Don’t be afraid to joke around  
If it feels right, I’ll throw in something like “Promise this isn’t a cold pitch. I’m not even wearing a headset.” People want to connect with humans, not robots.",2,1749138331.0,smallbusiness,1,0.67,False

1l42hp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1l42hp2/im_looking_for_investors/,👉 “I’m looking for investors.”,"My proposal is to develop a digital platform where both physical and virtual businesses can be listed, allowing individuals to invest in shares or purchase ownership stakes in real-world companies.

Each business profile will include professional photos, key information, and performance data, giving investors the tools to make informed decisions in both local and digital ventures.

🔁 A standout feature is a trial investment period ranging from 1 week to 1 month. If the investor is not satisfied within this time frame, they may withdraw their capital with no penalties.

For example, a well-established coffee chain like Café del Valle could join the platform. They publish their business profile, and an investor from Europe, for instance, reviews their growth and market data. If convinced, the investor purchases shares. As Café del Valle expands, the investor receives returns based on its real-world performance.

The platform aims to be a reliable bridge between growing businesses and global investors, offering transparency, flexibility, and real opportunities for financial growth

|Mar‑Apr 2025|Blizzard/Microsoft tested the first premium skin in four years (cel‑shaded Thrall, 1 500 gems).|[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/1l2brg7/happy_anniversary/)Reddit comments urging people to buy it all ended with “Support the janitor!”  |

**What players mean by it**

* It’s half sarcasm, half appreciation. *Sarcasm*: Blizzard is a multibillion‑dollar studio, yet fans joke it can spare only a janitor for HotS. *Appreciation*: That mini‑team really does read feedback and keep servers, matchmaker and balance alive.
* Spending any money in 2025 is seen as a “vote” to keep that tiny support budget alive. So when new cosmetics like Janitor Leoric (yes, an actual mop‑wielding Leoric skin) or this year’s Thrall skin appear, fans say “buy it to feed the janitor.”
* It isn’t literally one employee, but the meme reminds everyone that HotS survives on minimal resources—far less than League or Dota—and every revenue blip helps justify continued patches.

So when you read “support the janitor” on the forums, just translate it to: *“If you still like HotS, throw a few bucks at the game so Blizzard’s tiny caretaking crew can keep mopping the Nexus floors and shipping those monthly balance notes.”*",7,1749138221.0,heroesofthestorm,6,0.67,False

 Last night, I made a couple of garlic butter white wine steamed artichokes using my instapot.  They were delicious and the kids had zero interest so my husband and I each ate one. This morning, we both had a bit of gas and I thought that was the worst of it..... boy, was I wrong. 

Just after having coffee and sending the kids off to school, it came. The reminder text from school. ...

**Awards Ceremony** in the MPR this morning. 

My husband and I have never had gas this bad. It's comical. Loud, long, stinky farts. Often.  So we scramble and do our best to get it together. We gas ourselves out the whole car ride to the school. Then we made our way into the MPR and the wait began.  We decided standing in the back was the way to go. We stood, we clapped, we used every single muscle available to hold the pressure in. 

Suddenly, my husband made a face, and the creaking sound of a muffled fart... I couldn't hold my giggles and that was a HUGE MISTAKE.  The next thing I know, I am laugh-farting! We both start laughing so hard we had to step out the side door and when we walked out dying of laughter, there was a whole group of parents waiting for the next grade's awards. So now at least 15 people are looking at us like we have 3 eyes and we are just fighting for our lives. We walked around back to the front door, snuck back in and stood 10 feet apart on the side wall, for safety. It was a hilarious drive home. 

Lesson learned.  Apparently artichokes cause us gas.

TL,DR: I gave my husband and and myself a horrible case of gas before a school award ceremony. ",14,1749138188.0,tifu,5,0.94,False

I was walking alone around the mall with my brown baseball cap on, so you couldn’t really see my face. I didn’t think I looked cute or anything…just normal, kind of blending in. Seriously, nothing special and very basic. 

I was heading to grab a quick coffee. It was the middle of the day and the mall was empty. I wasn’t really paying attention, just looking down as I walked. Then, out of nowhere this random guy (in his 20s) approaches me and says, “Excuse me, I noticed you from afar and just wanted to let you know that you’re beautiful.”

It completely caught me off guard. I literally said, “What?” because I wasn’t sure I heard him right. He repeated himself, and I was kind of stunned, shocked, confused(?). I replied quickly with a, “Oh, thank you!”…..but I’m pretty sure my face said WTF is happening because, for a second, my mind jumped to ‘am I getting trafficked OR kidnapped?’ (Probably cuz I’m always on guard….)

He asked for my name, shook my hand, and asked what I was up to. I told him I was just getting coffee. He smiled and said, “Okay, well enjoy the coffee,” and walked off. WHAT? HELLO?

I was left so confused… my heart started beating fast out of anxiety or flattery ? I’m not sure. 

It was totally random, but… oddly sweet? He didn’t ask for my number or anything (and not that I wanted him to or anything)….just gave me a compliment and left. 

It’s actually the second time something like this has happened where some guy comes up, asks my name, shakes my hand, and then just walks away. [to be fair the first time was a bit.. odd.. he said I looked similar to an actress he worked with but wouldn’t tell me her name….]

Anyways…

Do guys usually do this? This is my first time experiencing these types of approaches. It happened pretty quick like 1 minute… maybe he saw me up close and was like “nah.” 😭 idk… ",4,1749137994.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False

The lelit bianca seems to tick all those boxes, of course at a price, new often around 2100€ here, which is nearly 2x the price of cheaper HX machines.

In a world teetering on the brink of environmental collapse, the whispers of change rise like a phoenix from the ashes. Sustainable finance is not merely a trend; it is a clarion call to humanity—a rallying cry for those who dare to dream of a harmonious existence where profits meet purpose. Imagine a financial system infused with intention, transforming the very fabric of commerce into a tapestry woven with integrity, compassion, and sustainability.

Beneath the surface, a revolution brews. Investors are no longer satisfied with earning a quick buck; they hunger for impact. They seek to merge wealth creation with a mission—to leave the world better than they found it. This is the dawn of a new economic era, where balance sheets bear witness to social responsibility and environmental stewardship. This is not just finance; it’s a force of nature, an unstoppable wave crashing against the shores of tradition.

Picture the roaring engines of capital, now redirected toward sustainable projects, green technologies, and renewable resources. Each dollar invested becomes a seed, capable of blossoming into forests of opportunity—clean energy solutions, innovative agriculture, and resilient communities. The movement is alive, pulsing with the energy of a million hearts ignited by the desire for a healthier planet.

But how do we participate in this transformation? First, we must shift our mindset. Let go of the old beliefs that profit must come at the cost of the Earth. Embrace the truth that sustainability is profitability—long-term gains rooted in ethical practices. Educate yourself; dive into the principles of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance). Seek out organizations that prioritize transparency and impact. Become a guardian of your investments, demanding accountability and vision.

Next, engage with your community. Start conversations at coffee shops, schools, and workplaces. Discuss sustainable finance over lunch, challenge the status quo, and champion the voices of entrepreneurs who are crafting innovative solutions—those who refuse to compromise. Wear your values on your sleeve and let passion radiate from your very being. Movement begins with dialogue.

Support local initiatives that resonate with your newfound purpose. Invest in businesses committed to social equity, environmental repair, and community resilience. Participate in crowdfunding campaigns that empower innovators in climate tech or social enterprises. Shout from the rooftops the stories of those who dare to make a difference; let their successes inspire others!

As we embrace sustainable finance, we reimagine our role in the world. We recognize that we are stewards, not just consumers. Rather than being passive participants in an economic system that prioritizes profits over people, we become agents of change. The shift is profound—a sacred alchemy transforming transactions into tributes of hope.

But the stakes are high. The urgency can’t be overstated. We are at a crossroads, and every decision we make reverberates into the future. Our planet is pleading for restoration, and the time to act is now. Align your portfolio with purpose; let your financial choices echo your deepest values.

Together, we can ignite a movement that’s more than just finance; it’s a renaissance of the spirit. By embracing sustainable finance, we breathe life into our collective vision—a vision grounded in equity, sustainability, and responsible stewardship. The power lies in our hands, waiting to be unleashed.

This is not a mere endeavor; it is a legacy we choose to leave. Will you answer the call? Will you join the ranks of those who dare to believe in a better tomorrow? The path is illuminated, and the journey begins with one bold step. Let’s not just witness change—let’s become change. Together, we will forge a future that reflects the best of us. Stand firm in faith, fueled by a vision of transformation. Now is our moment. The revolution has begun.

1l425ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1l425ac/simple_dos_and_donts/,Simple do's and dont's,"This feels like a right of passage being able to post about Japan on Reddit. Here's a few tips I'd recommend for anyone going for their first time.

Do’s

- Fly into Haneda, it's very quick to get to Ginza or Shibuya.
- Stay in Ginza to start, the station isn't too big so you won't get lost. It's also walkable to Tokyo Station for your travel onwards.
- Get an esim from Journey Across Japan, worked a treat.
- Buy the best little adaptor with multiple USB ports on it. It's great when everything is charging out of one place so you don't loose anything.
- Visit Hie Shrine in Tokyo, for some reason this was very quiet and has a very impressive Tori Gate line you can enjoy with few people.
- Wear comfy shoes. There's not many places to sit down like in Europe, unless you're in a restaurant or bar. Even in shrines there's no seats.
- Bring a small case, you're going to be carrying it up and down stairs in subway stations.
- Try every canned Boss Coffee - especially Rainbow Mountain.
- Buy Family Mart Line socks.
- Learn these two phrases, Sumi-masen (excuse me) and Oh Kai Kei (the bill).
- Book a hotel in a city with an Onsen. That way you don't loose an entire day to one experience at a remote location.
- Enjoy the hotel pyjamas, they're always provided.
- Be prepared to carry to rubbish you generate that day with you. There's minimal visual garbage in Japan, it's because everyone takes it home.
- Always have your passport, you never know what you'll want tax-free.
- Ride the bus sometimes over subways, you'll see more.

Dont's

- Don't stay in Shibuya to start your trip, the station is overwhelming and you'll get lost. It takes forever if you pick the wrong exit to.
- Don't bother with a WiFi dongle unless there's loads of you. It's one more thing you'd need to charge and carry around.
- Don't be that jerk with the giant case, the same stairs mentioned above still apply.
- Don't leave your rubbish anywhere, including on Shinkansen trains.
- Don't worry about getting around on trains, it's incredibly easy and there are always seats.
- Don't be loud.",10,1749137425.0,JapanTravelTips,8,0.73,False

I have a feeling that these past few days for you must be filled with work, analyzing the new book for your class, maybe grading some summative assessments? Still, you remain heavily on my mind. I can’t help but wonder if during the after hours, when you come home to find my gift (wherever it’s sitting at) do you think of me the same way I do each time I look at the box of roses you gave me (again, sorry for loosing the flowers you gave at graduation). One thing you said (amongst other things) that stuck with me was you saying you return from the states in July. And that you’ll shoot me a message. I’ve been going back and forth on, do I say yes? Do I bring a friend? I know pursuing this isn’t a good idea, despite being graduated and legal. And if you really have no shame about it, I believe that reveals your pattern of doing this frequently. Then again I do not have the guts to reach out and ask your former students if they’ve experienced anything similar, how embarrassing would it be if they said no. What do I wear? Minimal or full glam? Would a fitted shirt lead you on? Coffee or drinks? Would we take the metro home together? Would you reject me bringing a friend? What else would you bring up? It drives me mad that I don’t know. I don’t even know if you’ll go through with it. You’ve got me anticipating it. Wrapped around your fingers, before you even wanted it. Oh well. Que sera sera. I guess I’ll see you in July. ",1,1749137412.0,TeacherCrushes,0,1.0,False

1l423xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/1l423xz/a_peek_at_the_inner_workings_of_a_local_authority/,A peek at the inner workings of a local authority planning department,"This is something that happened almost a decade ago and the local authority I worked for no longer exists  (having recently been merged with other local authorities) however it popped into my head recently and I was curious over whether my case for wrongful dismissal, which ACAS advised me not to pursue, had any merit. But after spending way too long typing I lost interest in that but kept going as it makes for a good story. It's a long read but I'm interested to share my experience in local authorities and see how common it is.

Around 10 years ago I got a job as a planning technician within a local authority. This job basically involved providing administrative support to the development control section of the planning department which determined planning applications (as opposed to the policy section which wrote the local plan). Specifically however I had certain essential duties, these were:

* receiving new planning applications, checking all the necessary information was included and if so, marking them as valid, producing the 'red-line' plan (the map which showed the boundaries of the proposed development), writing letters to notify neighbours and statutory stakeholders (such as highways, heritage, environmental authorities, parish councils and so on) and passing them to a planning officer to determine.
* If they weren't valid, writing to the applicant to inform we needed certain extra information from them before their application would be valid.
* For most applications, the council had 28 days to determine them either way, if they failed to do so then the application would be 'deemed approved' meaning the application would be automatically granted, regardless of whether or not it contravened local and national planning policy. The clock would start ticking from a moment a valid application was recieved, this meant my job was extremely time sensitive. Ideally I should be processing applications on the same day that we recieved them so that the officer had the full 28 days to determine them.
* monitoring the e-mail and snail-mail inboxes and passing on correspondence to the appropriate officer or replying to more general queries.
* Responding to freedom of information requests.
* putting together the agenda and presentation material for planning committee meetings (slides themselves would be provided by officers but I had to put these into a single powerpoint presentation), which took place once a month as well as physically setting up the meeting room on the day, fetching the projector and meeting laptop from the IT department and setting them up, laying out the information packs for councillors and media, showing members of the public to their seats and making tea and coffee.
* replying to queries from members of the public over whether their plans required planning permission
* acting as duty-officer once per week. This was the person who on that day would come down to reception to advise members of the public who had come into the council offices. I would also produce the duty-rota on which the planning officers would each be duty-officer once per fortnight.

However there were many many issues... chief among which were that the department was woefully understaffed.

* The head of development control had been signed off sick for six months already before I started after twisting his wrist (though colleagues openly talked about him, saying he was fine to come back to work, he just didn't want to).
* The head of planning (i.e. both DC and policy) was hated by most of his staff, known to throw officers under the bus at any hint of bad publicity (which in town-planning is almost all publicity, if people don't like a decision then they will become convinced that it must be down to corruption or incompetence and he would just let the media believe this offering no counter argument) and would disappear into his office for hours at a time, locking the door and being uncontactable but we'd know he was in there because Microsoft Teams showed him as online.
* Turnover of planning officers was high. In my six months there only about half of those who were there when I started were still there when I left. We had come to rely heavily on officers provided by an agency which were more expensive than hiring them ourselves and often had little knowledge of the area but a welcome outside opinion, often of horror at the way things were being run. Quite often a single application would have a different officer by the end of it than it did at the start.
* Officers and elected members were frequently at odds. Members wanted to make votewinning decisions, and especially with this being a mostly rural district were motivated chiefly by status. Officers wanted to make decisions which could be backed up by policy and reason and were typically motivated by a desire to have a positive impact, for society and for the environment. Typically only large and/or contentious applications should be called in for decision at planning committee, your run-of-the-mill applications for things like extensions on private dwellings,  small alterations which wouldn't have required permission at all if it weren't that they were in a conservation area, applications to renew or amend an exsting permission, agricultural applications and changes of use which would have little to no real impact on anyone besides the applicant themselves should normally be decided by an officer that should be the end of it.
* The planning committee was one of the committees that most members wanted to be on as it gave them most opportunity to, as they saw it, defend the interests of residents, or as I saw it, get good publicity and win votes. This meant it was bloated with people looking to represent very narrow interests and with conflicting opinions and that far more applications were called in for decision at committee than really should have been (remember, if a decision wasn't reached in 28 days then permission would be deemed granted and the committee met once per month).
* This placed additional burden on planning officers as if an application was called in, they had to prepare a report for members explaining their recommendation and accompany the members on a site visit (which in this rural area could sometimes be an hour's drive from the office).
* Members didn't seem to understand at all that being elected didn't give them carte-blanche to do as they wished under the guise of democracy. For example, in planning there are things called material considerations, these are the things which you are allowed to take into account when deciding a planning application, generally things which are about the public good. Things which are not material considerations include potential for bad publicity and chief among all the non-material considerations... house prices.
* If the committee went against the officer's recommendation, especially if the members, despite being coached not to, raised non-material considerations then it would almost certainly lead to an appeal and almost certainly the council would lose that appeal and their decision would be overturned with costs awarded against the council, a public ticking off from the planning inspector for non-material considerations and the inevitable bad publicity this brought. The officer also now had additional workload in seeing to the appeal, which took greater precedence than planning applications since failing to turn up on time to meetings the inspector requested was very bad juju and also trying to justify the unjustifiable writing a report that tried to turn the whim of some councillor into a reasoned and legally sound decision was just a massive waste of their time, not to mention in the opinion of most of them, totally unethical. If they went against the recommendation the officer made in their original report then you've basically already provided the applicant all the evidence they need to go to appeal and these reports were public records and despite what the members thought, could not simply be redacted.
* The practices and record-keeping of the council were extremely outdated, lots of records existed on paper only and were kept in a dusty basement only roughly in any sort of order. I frequently had to go retrieve files, either for officers who needed to refer to a previous permission that hadn't been digitised yet or for member of the public as it was one of the more common requests at reception when I was duty officer. It could sometimes take an hour or more just to find the file I was looking for and at the same time they were incredibly resistent to the idea that technology could actually help. For example I didn't like having to copy names and addresses by hand into the templates for notification letters, it just felt like a recipe for mistakes so I put them all in a spreadsheet and used mail-merge to make all the letters, meaning I could do in 5 minutes something I'd normally spend an hour doing and there was now almost no chance I'd mistype something or put the wrong information in potentially leading to a GDPR breach. I was reprimanded for not following procedures and told that I was wasting time on the additional step of putting the addresses into a spreadsheet and that doing it by hand should guarantee there are no mistakes.

Anyway, all this sort of stuff had been going on long before I was there and a lot of it probably wasn't even that specific to this council. You see similar (though maybe this was an extreme case) issues in planning departments up and down the country. As far as this relates to myself though and why I felt harshly treated by them there's more.

* When I started I learned that there had previously been two planning technicians but when one was promoted to planning officer and the other quit they decided they could get by with just one.
* I have ADHD and disclosed this, I visited an occupational therapist in the first week of my employment and she suggested four or five reasonable accommodations... none of these were followed.
* I was supposed to have sessions for the first couple of weeks learning the council's way of doing things, how their records were organised, the procedures they followed for certain types of task and the software they used. However due to staffing issues this was all cancelled and I was given two lever arch files full to the brim with instructions for everything you could imagine, in no particular order with no contents or index, just stuff my predecessors had accumulated as they went along and told everything I needed to know was in these. Could take almost an hour at the start of any task just to find and follow the instructions, some of which turned out to be outdated. This was particularly tough with my ADHD as picking out titbits of information among endless paragraphs took a lot longer than it would have someone without ADHD but I'm not claiming I should get special treatment, this would be difficult for anyone. What I don't like is the assertion my superiors would make  that i must be taking longer because I was wasting time doing unimportant stuff.
* The head of planning had something of an obsession with appeasing the media, as mentioned he would throw people under the bus, including pulling me up for a data protection breach when I put the wrong address on a letter and the person who recieved it complained. Thing is with planning is that nearly all the information we deal with is in the public record, the wrong information that this guy recieved anyone could have looked up so I understand it looks bad but he was making it out to be far more serious than it really was.
* In a similar vein he was obsessed with looking good when it came to freedom of information requests. We are allowed to decline these if we don't keep data on what they're asking for, if completing the request would take an unreasonable amount of our time or if the information being asked for was already publicly available (honestly about half of requests were from journalists who wanted us to do their job for them, asking us to produce statistics about planning applications which, I'll say again, are all in the public record) but he wouldn't have it and wanted me to comply with every request we got.
* About four months into my time there, he went off sick due to stress (I do sympathise with him to be perfectly honest, he contributed a lot towards the problems but mostly it wasn't his fault even if the way he reacted, by throwing people under the bus wasn't great).
* By this time the head of DC was back from his ten month absence for his sprained wrist however he didn't want to be promoted to head of planning. In a move I can only describe as bizarre, the head of Human Resources appointed herself as the new head of planning despite knowing absolutely nothing about how planning worked. She presented herself as a troubleshooter here to whip us into shape.
* During her first week in her new role (HR now being handled solely by her assistant) she decided to rearrange all the furniture, believing a new arrangement would help us work more efficiently. This meant that for two days all planning related work was put on hold as instead we spent our time dragging desks, bookcases and filing cabinets around.
* The head of DC unable to type due to his wrist essentially made me his PA. I now also had to, among other things such as arranging meetings for him, take dictation whenever he wanted to send an email. Also I would frequently assign him applications only to find them back on my desk a few days later, nothing having been done with them, and with a note saying to assign them to someone else. I stopped assigning him applications (just gonna overlook the issues inherent with the most junior member of the team being the one tasked with assigning work) and was then told by the 'head of planning' that she'd had a word with him and to assign him his fair share. This went back and forth for a while.
* At some point we recieved a large number of applications for solar farms. These were quite big and definitely contentious so on this occasion they definitely needed to go to committee, also they would have longer than 28 days to determine them (think it was 60 days for large applications such as this). Despite this the entire thing was a fiasco from start to finish. The committee wanted to refuse them all out of hand, but the vast majority had no reasonable grounds to be refused. Nevertheless they were mostly all refused... those that weren't were because they went over the 60 days and were automatically granted. Now we're onto the phase of the townsfolk gathering with metaphorical pitchforks, but there's more.
* Those that were refused were all appealed, and these were big news-grabbing appeals. Very embarrassing for the council and also a huge extra workload. In one case the head of DC failed to turn up at a meeting with the inspector on site where he'd been requested. I had recieved the notification that there was going to be a site inspection and passed it onto him but apparently his no-show was my fault because I should have known that he doesn't check his emails.
* Our new 'head of planning' wanted to be kept summarised with all of thse applications and appeals but unfortunately like I say, knew nothing about the planning system or the timescales and when the first of them went past the deadline and was automatically approved it was the first she heard that such a thing could happen, so now I had to constantly be her little knowledgebase and was essentially responsible for her awareness (or lack of) how the whole system worked.
* At some point during all of this she decided that I didn't need a desk of my own and was to spend the remaining month hotdesking.
* She also decided that I should have a new responsibility, someone needed to organise all those old paper files in the basement so I would spend maybe a day a week down there just getting files down, looking at them and trying to find somewhere for them to go.
* Finally to add insult to injury she told me that the time I was spending looking up procedures whenever something new landed on my desk was unacceptable as I had a degree in town planning and should have learned all this at university. It may not surprise you to learn that at no point during my degree were we familiarised with the working practices of every council in the country, this stuff was particular to this council, not universal.
* One day I went home at lunchtime and didn't return. The following day I turned up as normal and cited stress as the reason for this. She said obviously things weren't working out and I was reassigned to the administrative department downstairs, still within planning but now mainly just printing out and digitising files... well for half the week anyway, I continued with my old job for the other half and everyone else was expected to pick up the slack.
* This just created resentment among colleagues in both departments. Downstairs I was being paid more (not a huge amount but nevertheless more than people in that department were on) for doing the same work, while upstairs I'd abandoned them and my failings were now the reason that they had even greater workloads doing the stuff that I should be doing. Colleagues would openly say that hiring me had been a huge mistake and lump me in with their list of grievances against the former head of planning. Actually it was kinda nice to have the aforementioned agency planners on my side in this as they'd seen how things were supposed to be run and could see that the place was an utter shambles and that I was just a fall guy.

A few days after my six month probationary period had passed I was called into the 'head of planning's office and told that I had failed my probation and would be let go. The reason being 'lack of attention to detail' I was given the option of working out two weeks' notice, or I could simply walk out the door right there and then and they would still pay me for the two weeks. Obviously I chose the latter, went back to my desk, gathered my things without telling anyone else what I was doing, and left. I didn't even bother finishing typing the email I was half way through, just logged out and left. It may seem unprofessional to do that but I'd just been sacked and was feeling emotional and just wanted to be as far away from that place as possible.

I would regularly see one of the building control team (technically part of the planning department but really their own thing) at football matches as we both stood in the same area of the ground at our local football team and he would relay stuff to me about what happened after I left. Apparently it was two weeks before she even told other staff that I wouldn't be returning and I wouldn't be replaced, the other officers would have to pick up the slack caused by my abrupt departure. A month or two after this she herself left.",3,1749137337.0,UKJobs,2,1.0,False

I felt as if something switched in my brain, I don’t remember how long ago exactly (~3 years?). I’m not quite sure if the switch was flipped on or off. I felt as if I’ve never made a decision in my life for myself about myself without taking into consideration anything external input from others whether inquired about or unsolicited or unspoken. I recall stating as if I had “developed adult onset ADHD.” I slowly felt the tangled mess slowly unravel. Emotions heightened to extremes, sometimes without warning. Info dumping, loss of motivation, decision making abilities thrown onto the ground the stomped on, squishing it like a bug into the dirt. Awareness of internal processes, feeling as if I can pinpoint a nerve if I’m having pain, Noticing breath holding or chest tightness during emotional overwhelm and releasing it as a reset, adjusting environmental factors like temperature or airflow in response to subtle internal discomfort, feeling sudden physical agitation or stillness when mentally overstimulated followed by a need to regulate through small rituals or movement, feeling emotions physically (e.g. dread = writhing ball of dark string in a huge tangle in epigastric region), monitoring posture, voice, or facial expression in social settings tied to self-perception and others’ reactions, and experiencing waves of energy or heaviness in the body linked to mood shifts, memory recall, or decision-making. I can go to work as a medical professional for 12+ hours, but don’t have the motivation or do have “too many options too tasking to complete”. A PB&J? Forget about it, getting out the loaf of bread, untying the twistie, selecting two slices, hopefully not moldy, retrying the twister, returning bread to pantry, find peanut butter in pantry, obtain knife, etc you get it. I need a recipe-like task list for all individual tasks. Dove deep into potential Autism and ADHD characteristics, seemingly overlapping. I may not know the psychology part, but I do know the “Me” part, and with my vocabulary or metacognitive ability to describe my experiences, I think I have a good shot of conveying what I’m aiming to convey or explain in terms where I may hopefully be at least a little bit understood. I’m a little past AuDHD research now - mostly let down due to not having many people in my life who understands or is willing to put in the effort TO understand, or I just appear so put together externally that it’s too difficult for others to grasp, I still have questions but I’m waiting on my therapist’s schedule to open up, so I’m running rampant in my research alone.

Hey, everyone! So, I was sitting here sipping my coffee, scrolling through a few job listings, and I couldn’t help but notice one thing: the AI buzz is real! 🐝 Can you believe how fast this tech is taking over? 

It’s like trying to catch a train that’s already speeding down the tracks. Seriously, if we don’t jump on board now, we might find ourselves in the “XYZ department” working on archaic spreadsheets while the rest of the world is out there using AI to *work smarter* instead of *harder*. 

Here’s the thing: if you want to not only survive but THRIVE, you’ve got to pick up some AI skills ASAP! Let me share some quick thoughts on how to start leveling up.

### Here are a few AI skills to consider that’ll actually pay the bills:

- **Data Analysis**: If you're still wondering what to do with that mountain of data at your company, it’s time to master tools like Python and R. Being able to analyze trends makes you a sought-after asset. 
- **Machine Learning Basics**: No, you don’t need to become a tech wizard overnight! But knowing the basics will help you understand how predictions work. Imagine telling your boss, “Hey! I can automate this!” 😏
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Honestly, understanding how computers can ‘read’ and ‘understand’ human language is fascinating. And it’s super useful – hello, chatbots! 
- **AI Ethics**: As we race into the future, understanding the ethical implications of AI is crucial. It shows that you’re not just about the tech, but about doing the right thing too.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Yeah, it sounds fancy, but honestly, it’s just about knowing how to ask the right questions to get the best results from AI tools. You could be the wizard who gets AI to work like a charm!

So, if you’re thinking, “Where do I start?”, I get you! It can be overwhelming. But trust me, there are great resources out there. I stumbled across this program that’s packed with insights and practical skills for beginners to advanced folks alike—check it out here: [Imagine Education AI](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). It might just be the push you need to kickstart your AI journey!

And hey, if you feel like you’ve fallen behind, don’t stress. Learning is a journey, not a race. 🚀 We’ve all been there, staring at a screen with zero clue about what’s going on. Just remember, the first step is to keep your mind open and put yourself out there. 

What’s your experience been with AI? Have you found any cool resources or moments that made you think, “Wow, I can really do this!”? Let’s share stories and help each other level up! ✨",1,1749137095.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I'm a recovering alcoholic with 4.5 years sober, idk if that matters.
I watch my diet pretty well- I eat Oatmeal with half water/half milk and some fruit with coffee every morning for breakfast, sandwich/pizza/poultry/fish for lunch, and a balanced protein, veg, and starch for dinner. I'll generally eat some trail mix (cashews, peanuts, dried cranberries, and a few almonds with a few M&Ms thrown in) as a before bed snack. I'll have a random diet coke every few days but other than that I drink one Gatorade per day and canned seltzers or Brita water otherwise.
I realize that my diet is fiber rich but I've been on this sort of diet consistently for years now... with no issues. My intention is balance and stable energy levels.

The last three days my BMs have been VERY bloody. VERY. I'm pretty regular (first thing in the AM) but before this I had had maybe two days of random diarrhea in the afternoon which is very odd for me.

My diet hasn't changed and my overall health has been good. However, I've had some heavy afternoon lethargy, which is also abnormal. The fact that the diarrhea coincides with the lethargy may or may not be important but I'm just giving a whole picture.
I definitely have a feeling of pressure but... I never have to pass gas.

I'm not super great at talking about this stuff but I figure a clearer picture is going to be best.

Any ideas on what this could be or if it's a big deal? Obviously if this persists I'll schedule with a gastro but should I take this more seriously and ask for an emergency appointment to get in sooner?

Typing this from the bathroom with the hopes that this lady is gone by the time I come out, because i dont think i can be nice to her. 

I (30F) work part-time at a coffee shop (in addition to my full-time), small local place, the owners are great people, extremely welcoming environment, definitely and VISIBLY a “safe space” that the boomers like to whine about so much. 

This *individual* walks in and casually remarks “wow, they’re opening new coffee shops around here like gun stores in the ghetto.”

Guys, gun violence is a huge problem in this city. I’m fortunate to live in an area where it’s minimal, but not unheard of—there was a shooting at my regular grocery store just a few weeks ago. But go a couple miles to the east, and you’ve got an area that’s EXTREMELY troubled by gun violence, and it’s actually destroyed lives. I know people personally who’ve lost friends, siblings and children to gun violence. Kids get hit by stray bullets *in their own homes* where they should be safe. People get caught in crossfires of conflicts they had NOTHING to do with and die in my city. I used to work at a different shop that was in “the ghetto”, and there were SO MANY PEOPLE who came in who were struggling single parents, disabled veterans, college kids etc. who were just looking for affordable housing and ended up in an area where they don’t feel safe leaving their homes after dark. Like gun violence is NOT a rare occurrence in my city, and A LOT of people here have been personally affected by it. 

So needless to say, I didn’t find her “joke” very funny, and all I could manage was “oh…. Wow.” At which point of course she got grouchy. God forbid you realize you said something extremely offensive to a stranger and apologize. 

Anyway that’s all. Who the fuck says something like that to someone they don’t know. Maybe she assumed because I’m white id just laugh and agree—that’s not the world you live in anymore, lady. Do better. ",203,1749136014.0,BoomersBeingFools,45,0.94,False

1l41g7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddardReddit/comments/1l41g7m/the_pearl_of_great_price_lecture_by_neville/,The Pearl of Great Price Lecture by Neville Goddard,"Tonight’s subject is the “Pearl of Great Price.” This is taken from the 13th chapter of the gospel of Matthew, 45 th and 46th verses. It’s all about the kingdom of heaven. First of all, let us say that the kingdom of heaven is simply that state into which man rises, where everything is completely subject to his imaginative power. He is destined to be an heir, one with his Father who is God, where everything is put under his power. Now, here is the quote from this 13 th of Matthew: “The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, who finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.” It is my hope that I can bring you to that pearl tonight. You may not value it to the point where you’re willing to sell all that you have to buy it, but I will tell you of this pearl. Very few are willing to sell all and buy the pearl.



But let me now quote from another passage of the gospel, the 11 th chapter of the Book of Luke, the 21 st through the 23 rd: “When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are in peace; but when one stronger than he assails him and overcomes him, he takes from him the armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoil.” The very next line, as though it’s an afterthought, throws all the light in the world upon that statement, “He who is not with me is against me.” There is no benevolent neutrality, none whatsoever. He who is not with me is my enemy; he is against me.



So we find the one who is completely in control of this kingdom of heaven, and I tell you that being is called in scripture, Christ. But Christ is defined as “the power and the wisdom of God.” In the first chapter of the first letter of Paul to the Corinthians, “Christ is the power and the wisdom of God” (verse 24). Don’t look for a man. A man is only the instrument through which this power and this wisdom is exercised, but Christ himself is the power and the wisdom of God. You and I are the instruments through which this power and this wisdom is exercised.



So Paul makes the statement, “From now on we’ll regard no one from the human point of view; even though we once regarded Christ from the human point of view, we regard him so no longer.” You who are taking notes, that’s his 2nd letter to the Corinthians, the 5th chapter, the 16 th verse. “From now on we regard no one from the human point of view; even though we once regarded Christ from the human point of view, we regard him thus no longer.” And then he, the author of that statement, defines Christ for us, “Christ is the power and the wisdom of God” (1 Corinthians 1:24).



Now we are told, “By him all things were made and without him was not anything made that was made,” but nothing (John 1:3). And so we invite you now to test Christ in you. Again from the letters of Paul, the 13th chapter, 5th verse—in fact, read it through to the 7th verse—but I’ll quote you the 5th: “Examine yourselves, to see whether you are holding to the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in thee?—unless of course you fail to meet the test. I hope you will discover that we have not failed” (2 Corinthians 13:5). And then he gives us a warning, for now he’s speaking only of power, power and wisdom personified in the form of one called Christ Jesus. And now he warns us, “I hope and I pray to God that you do not use it in the wrong way” (verse 7). Even if you think—he’s implying now that I have not used it to the full of my knowledge—I’d rather that you hear and feel that I have made a mistake or I have failed than that you use it evilly, implying, stating quite openly, that you can misuse power.



Everyone in the world is using this only power, but they don’t know it. And so, he’s trying to bring us to the knowledge of this power and the wise use of it. It’s called, as we first quoted it, the pearl of great price. So great is this pearl, so valuable, that it takes everything that you own to buy it. Now you don’t go and liquidate your stocks and bonds; you don’t sell your homes; you don’t sell anything in the world of Caesar. But it takes everything that you now believe in other than it to pay for it. You believe in authority? You’ve got to sell it. You believe in numerology, in teacup leaves, in astrology and all these things? No matter what you believe in as a power to control you, you’ve got to sell it. It takes all these beliefs and you’ve got to sell them. No one will buy them from you, but you give them up as valueless. Therefore, there’s no price attached, no value whatsoever.



But you can’t hold on to one thing you now believe in as a power that controls your life and still hope to buy the pearl of great price. Everything you now believe in, whether it be even the drugs that you take; even the things of diets—if you’re a vegetarian and you think that’s the way to God; if you’re a meat eater and you think that’s the way to God; if you’re a nonsmoker, nondrinker, and that’s the way to God; or if you are a smoker and a drinker and that’s the way to God. There is no way to God but Christ: “I am the way.” There is no other way, way to what? To everything in this world, but especially to the Father. “No one comes unto the Father but by me.” And here he defines it: he is the only way in the world to everything in this world that you and I seek. And it takes everything that we own as to beliefs that we think are powers to guide our life to pay for that pearl of great price. If you think for one moment you can hold on to one little thing in the event this doesn’t work, you can’t buy the pearl. So when I buy the pearl, I go all out and live by it. And there is no other being in this world, just this pearl, and I live by it. This pearl is your own wonderful human Imagination. That’s Christ.



Now I see her in the audience tonight. Last Friday night, this sweet lady told me this story. She went into the baker to buy the usual things that we buy when we go to a bakery, and the lady who waited on her didn’t look well. She, without asking the reasons for her present appearance, in her own mind’s eye, when she got home, talked to her as though she stood before her physically. She didn’t sit down, she didn’t relax, didn’t go into a trance, just brought her before her mind’s eye and heard her say that she felt so well, and she complimented her on the way she looked. She looked so well. This was a communion between two souls, how she looked so well. And she believed in the reality of her imaginal act. One week later, she goes back into the same bakery, and here is this lady, same lady but radiant. So radiant it prompted a response from this one, and she said, “But you look so well! What has happened?” Well, she said, “This past week I inherited some money, and I paid all of my bills. I paid everything that I owed in this world, and so I have no debts and I have money.” Now, this lady is totally unaware of the gift she received from the lady who is present here tonight, totally unaware of it.



Now listen to these words and try to put any other interpretation upon them in the world, and then tell me if you can. This is from the 25 th chapter of the Book of Matthew: “In as much as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it unto me.” You don’t need the consent of any being in this world to hear good news for them. You don’t have to say, “Do you want me to hear it?” Do you want praise? If you ask them in advance, “Should I hear good news for you?” you are only asking in the event that it works, they’ll praise you or in some way give you something. You don’t ask anyone for their permission to hear good news. For, “In as much as you have heard it, as you have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it unto me. And when you did not do it, you did not do it unto me” (verse 45).



And so every moment of time, there’s the opportunity to do it unto Christ Jesus, Christ Jesus being your own wonderful human Imagination. To see man in need and not act in your own wonderful Imagination, like she did, is to keep the wounds open and to bear more and more stripes upon the body of Christ Jesus, for the only Christ Jesus is in you as your only wonderful human Imagination. “Christ in you is the hope of glory. Come test yourself and see.” What a wonderful invitation, “Test yourself”! How would I test myself? Well, this is how you test yourself. I tell you that if you imagine, as this lady did, that someone stands before you in bodily form, although they cannot be seen with your mortal eye, but actually you imagine they are standing before you and you carried on a conversation with them from the premise of your fulfilled desire for them, and then you feel them as you would feel them were they now solidly present, and you believe in the reality of that imaginal act, it’s done!



And how it happens you need not be concerned. It has its own manner of externalizing itself within their world. All you need do is do it. As told us in the 1 st chapter of the Book of James, “Receive with meekness the implanted word”—and the word is called Christ Jesus, the power and the wisdom of God—“But be ye doers of the word, and not merely hearers, deceiving yourselves” (verse 22). So when he tells me to be the doer of the word, the world thinks it means to go out and make some physical effort. No, James is not telling me substitute works for faith. Works are the evidence as to whether the faith that I profess is alive or dead. Is it alive? If it’s alive, I will act upon it; if it’s not alive, well then, I won’t act upon it. I haven’t yet bought the pearl of great price.



When I buy the pearl of great price, there is no other pearl like it. I sell all in this world to buy it. I sell all beliefs in powers other than my own wonderful human Imagination. Everyone, because he has Imagination and everyone can imagine and everyone can believe in the reality of his imaginal act, is free. It sets a man free, for we are told, “If you believe my word and abide in my word, then you know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:31). Well, how does he define the truth? He said, “I am the truth.” He said, “If you know my word, you know the truth” and “I am the truth.” So if you abide in this, then you’ll be set free. You mean that if I simply imagine that I am the man that I would like to be, that’s all that I need do? Just try it. Imagine that you are already the man that you would like to be, the woman you’d like to be, your friends are and total strangers are as you would like them to be. Just imagine it. Try it. Test yourself and see. As you test yourself and it happens, well then, can you turn back to the belief in any power outside of Christ Jesus? It’s finding who he is, and I tell you Christ Jesus is your own wonderful human Imagination.



Christ in you must resurrect. And so you start to exercise him, believing in him. Believe in the law of Christ Jesus and be saved. So I begin to believe in him, put all my trust in him. It doesn’t matter where I start in life. Behind the eight-ball? Makes no difference. I start believing in him and only in Christ Jesus. Then I take off from there, giving my entire life to him, just as though there were no others, just Christ Jesus, and I have found him: he’s my own wonderful human Imagination. When I believe in him to that extent, things happen.



Now she tells me, the same lady—that’s why I named this tonight “The Pearl of Great Price”—that she had a dream. And here is all mud, nothing but mud, whirling mud. As it whirled and whirled and whirled before her mind’s eye in her dream she noticed a small, perfectly beautiful, perfect pearl. She picked it up and held this perfect pearl—wasn’t big but it was a perfect pearl—in her hand, and then she woke. Now, this pearl she found in the series of experiences that she conducted. For a boy came east, came from the East to the West, with instructions that if he couldn’t find a job in the immediate present, he had to return to the East. And so she simply, on a Friday night, saw him, not physically but in her mind’s eye, as though he stood before her physically and congratulated him on the job, just as though it were a true physical contact. On Monday, the boy got the job and therefore did not have to return to the East Coast.



Now, here is a young lady—I call her a young lady, as she can’t be more than her early twenties. If I looked at her through my eyes, all things being relative, she has three little babies, but I wouldn’t think she’s more than her early twenties. I’d be surprised if she’s past beyond the middle twenties, looking at her. Born in Italy, of a Catholic family, Catholic faith, brought to this meeting of ours by her mother-in-law, and adopted this concept of Christ Jesus. Her family despairs because they think unless you have their concept of Christ Jesus, there is no entrance into the kingdom of heaven as they understand it. But I tell her she is well into it. She’s exercising the only Christ Jesus in the world.



He calls upon us to test him every moment of time. But you can’t buy him unless you pay the price, and the price—it takes everything that you have to buy him. Listen to the words, “The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, who, finding one pearl of great value, went and sold everything that he had and bought it.” Everything, not a few things. The average person would say, “Well, after all, I know that’s all well and good, but Sanka does keep me in a state of sleep when normal coffee keeps me awake. And I know that an extra martini does so and so to me, and I take none. Or maybe, I could take vodka because it’s good for my breath and not the martini. And a thousand things in the world people have concerning what they should do. Every belief in a power outside of Christ Jesus you give up, and you give it up and hold onto him and only to him. Then you’ve bought the pearl. Then you exercise it, the greatest value in the world, and that’s Christ Jesus. So here, she has tonight— I think she has—the pearl of great price.



I hope you, tonight, will accept it. You know, not everyone who finds Christ Jesus sought him; they’re brought to him by one who found him. In the gospel, Philip found him, and then he brought his friend Nathaniel. Nathaniel wasn’t seeking him. Nathaniel was waiting for things to happen, for he knew the scripture backward. For when Nathaniel heard that the Messiah had appeared, he said, “What? Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” (John 1:46). And Jesus said of him, “An Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile” (verse 47). He knew his scripture. Peter wasn’t seeking him; his brother Andrew found him. Andrew went and called his brother Peter and said, “We have found him of whom Moses and the law spoke and all the prophets spoke.” So they were not looking for him, but they found him because someone found him and was so interested in what they found they wanted to share him with those that they loved. For if he is all that we claim that he is, we can’t keep him to ourselves; we have to share him.



And so maybe this night a total stranger may be here who is really not overly eager to change their concept of Christ Jesus. They aren’t seeking another concept of him at all. And maybe you will be interested enough to test what I’m talking about and see if this is not Christ Jesus, for listen to it, “By him all things are made and without him there was not anything made that was made” (John 1:3). Well now, here, a lady brought into being something that she had imagined without devising the means by which it would happen. She simply imagined it. Didn’t she make it? She certainly made it, without the consent of the one for whom she made it. Well, if she made it and all things are made by him, she didn’t say to herself, “Well, how can I make it? I only imagined it.” Therefore, he must be Imagination, and this being in action must be imagining. And there it is. So she found him. She tried it again and it worked. And someone tried it a third time, a twelfth time, a hundredth time, and it works.



But if I say this to someone in the world and they won’t even try it, well, you know in science to demand a proof before you are willing to make the experiment is nonsense. It’s only through the experiment and its working out in performance that proof can be received by us. So to demand proof before I make the experiment is stupid. So I say to the world, if there is evidence for a thing, then what the world thinks about it or even wishes for it is nothing to the point. Makes no difference whatsoever what the world thinks about this if I can prove it in performance.



So I say to you, take a friend who is now unemployed and bring him before your mind’s eye, as the lady did, and see him now gainfully employed. He need not be physically present—in fact, he’s not physically present—but you treat him as though he were and put your mental hand upon him and give him the solidity that would be there were it true. Then carry on a mental conversation with him from the premise that it is true, and let him tell you that he’s gainfully employed and that he loves what he is doing; there are such opportunities, such growth in what he is doing. And do nothing outside of that, for listen to the words of Paul concerning Christ, “Christ is the power and the wisdom of God.” It’s not only power, blind power; it’s wisdom, the wisdom of God. If it’s the wisdom of God, it knows how to navigate the whole vast world and move it to bring this one into a gainfully employed state. All you need to do is believe in Christ Jesus, and that is the pearl of great price. No power in the world can stop it. All it needs is acceptance on the part of us.



So here, “When there is a strong man, and he’s fully armed, and he guards his own palace, his goods are in peace; but when one stronger than he assails him and overcomes him, he takes from him the armor in which he believed, and then disposes of the spoil, divides the spoil.” Now that wonderful statement, “He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather with me scatters.” It’s so irrelevant to that scene that preceded it, and it throws all the light in the world upon that statement. Some power in the world comes into man’s mind; it’s Christ Jesus. You don’t need a social standing, a financial background, intellectual background, any of these backgrounds to feel secure in the world; you’ve found him. And this is the one who can overcome all the powers of the world, and if you are not with him, then you are against him. You wouldn’t think that.



In this world today, we have countries that are called neutralist countries, benevolent neutralist. Not in scripture—you’re either with me or against me, and either you’re with me or you’re my enemy. Can you imagine that? I’m either for him or his enemy. Can’t be neutral. I either believe in it, or I don’t believe in it. And of the nine hundred million Christians in the world, how many really believe in the true Christ? They believe in lighting a candle; they believe in genuflection and all the other things in the world, and I wouldn’t criticize any of them. Leave them, until they find the true Christ. \*\*When they find the true Christ, then it doesn’t really matter whether you eat meat or don’t eat meat, whether you drink or don’t drink, whether you smoke or don’t smoke, and whether you do any of these things. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the true Christ, for you do not give power to anything outside of Christ, and Christ is your own wonderful human Imagination.\*\* That’s Christ. So when you go before anyone, don’t even take thought as to what you’re going to say. Just imagine the end, and having pronounced his judgment based upon the end you have predetermined, do that.



Live this way in the world, trusting 100 percent in the pearl of great price. May I tell you, it will not fail you, but you can’t modify it. You can’t hold back one little reserve thing. I’m speaking from experience. Not knowing that it was my own Imagination that predicted accurately, through the medium of the cards and the medium of the stars, I held back a little reserve note in my mind’s eye when I found Christ. I would still have in my mind’s eye my old horoscope and I could quickly arrange its progression and I would know the day and justify failure. For the rule of my second house in conflict with the rule of my sixth, can’t get the job. There’s no money to it. So it’s all there; it’s all in my mind’s eye. I had to completely give it up and so tear up my horoscope in my mind’s eye it doesn’t exist. I had to completely destroy it as a power that guided me.



But I held it because I successfully foretold events for unnumbered people in New York City. I had almost the entire Metropolitan crowd. The entire Metropolitan Opera, they came to me. I so believed in what I did that I predicted with conviction. It worked. And they were so sold on it. Then I had to have an experience one day to show me it was only my own intense belief in these little symbols that made them work. I came into my friend’s home, and I taught her how to read charts and how to set them up. Her name was Carpenter, Norma Carpenter, and I taught her. Then, having retired from a teaching profession in Scranton, Pennsylvania, she had a small pension from the railroad where her husband worked, plus a small pension from her former job, so she eked out a living. But she could augment it in a nice way by telling and reading charts, and I taught her how to do it.



When I came to her place one day—she lived in a hotel—Norma was in tears. I said, “What’s wrong, Norma?” Well, she said, “A man called me up—he was recommended by a friend of mine—and he was very eager to see me right away. He had this fantastic deal on. So over the phone, before he arrived, he gave me his birthday, his hour, everything about it, and so I erected the chart. When he came, I told him, ‘I’m so convinced of this good fortune falling his way today that I can close the book on it.’ He said to me, ‘Mrs. Carpenter, if you’re telling me the truth, I will give you a hundred dollars.’ She said so confidently, “Well, give it to me now because it has to work today.” And she gave me all the reasons, which I knew—I taught them to her—how it had to work today because of this transitive moon over these certain aspects of the chart. He said, “No, if it works, you will get it today, but I’ll not give it to you now.”



I said, “What’s wrong with that?” Well, she said, “I made up this chart from a bound volume of Ephemerides. I was sitting at the open window—it’s hot—and so I turned away, I was diverted. And when I went back, I didn’t realize the wind had blown over the pages, and I erected the chart of a man who was born ten years before this man. This man wasn’t even born. I progressed my chart from this horoscope, made up ten years before the birth of this man.” I said, “Norma, did you believe it when you spoke to him?” She said, “Certainly I did!” I said, “Forget it! Just completely forget it. It’s done!” I was in her room, her suite of rooms, that night, around eight, when a Western Union boy came upstairs and delivered a check, a Western Union check for one hundred dollars. And the chart was drawn on a man who wasn’t born. He was born ten years after this chart of a man. But Norma cannot sell that because she feels “they all believed in me.” She cannot buy the pearl of great price because she feels her only security is to get her little, small check from the railroad in Pennsylvania and a small check from the schoolhouse in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and eke it out with this. So she cannot give up and buy the pearl.



You’ve got to give up every belief in this world in a power outside of Christ to buy Christ. There is nothing but Jesus Christ. So you either believe in him or you don’t believe in him. And any reservation for a rainy day—it’ll rain. So you hold back the belief in stars? Well, I’m confessing, having done it so successfully over the years, that I still carried in my mental furniture my chart. And so you see you could always justify failure. As Blake said, “Self-justification is the voice of hell.” I didn’t know it… in hell everyone is justifying himself. No matter what he does; if it’s a failure, he justifies it. He gives you all the reasons in the world. But hell is not a place outside of earth; it’s right here. So we are in the hell justifying failure. We say, I couldn’t do it because look at my Venus. And then as soon as Venus gets beyond the point where it interferes with me, But I still have Mercury. And so there I go. And when in spite of Venus and Mercury something happens, Oh, why didn’t I see this? Well, there it was all along.



A man goes back, and reflects and then again justifies. No. He went and sold all that he had and bought it. All that he had, not a few things. You can’t just buy it with a few of the things that you will dispose of. Yet you can use it, use it wisely and successfully, but you don’t really possess him, that pearl, unless you buy him. And you can only buy him when you’ve sold everything that you have. Well, then buy him. And so that it’s all out or nothing, so he who is not with me is against me. I know it’s a difficult thing, but is it worthwhile having when you consider by having Christ Jesus you are rising into a world of an entirely new order, where everything is subject to your imaginative power? You’re not here at all. You’re moving from the world of death into the world of life when you find him and make him one with you.



So you take it. And let me tonight in a quick summary—it will take me no more than one minute to do it, two minutes at the most—you take this pattern, it’s going to happen to you. Crucifixion is over for all of us. You aren’t going to be crucified. “I have been crucified with Christ; it is not I who lives, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.” That is Galatians, 2 nd chapter, 20 th verse. The 6 th of Romans, “If we have been united with Christ in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.” Listen to the tenses, “If we have been united with Christ in a death like his”—that’s past; then a change of tense—“we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his”—that’s to be. Now we are told that those are misleading the people by teaching that the resurrection is over and past—the resurrection is not. It’s to be. It’s taking place one after the other. So believe me, the crucifixion came first. That’s over.



The second stage in the unfolding drama is resurrection. The second stage when man awakes in a grave to find that he was all along dead or he wouldn’t awake in a grave. You don’t put anyone in a tomb unless he’s dead. So you awake in the tomb of your skull to find that it wasn’t what you thought it was; it was a tomb. And then at that very moment, that you discover, in the act of resurrecting, it now is converted from a tomb into a womb. And then comes the birth. So it’s crucifixion and then resurrection, birth from above—these are the three stages.



Then comes a fourth stage. The fourth stage is when the title of titles is conferred upon the one who is born from above. For conferred upon the risen Christ in the experience of man is the divine title, Father. No one can utter the word Father but the Son. So the Son, God’s only begotten Son, calls you Father, and then the title is conferred upon you and you are Father; one with God because he is God’s Son and he calls you Father and you know it (Psalm 2:7; Psalm 89:26).



Then comes the next stage, the final stage, when the temple and its wonderful curtain that separated man from God, is torn from top to bottom. So that now you have direct access to the being that you were and are, the being that is God. No intermediary between yourself and God. Go straight to the being that you really are, which being is God.



So these are the five perfect stages. And all the others told about him will happen in their own wonderful way, regardless of the order in which they happen. But this series, as I just gave it to you, this is the sequence. We’re all already crucified and all will be eventually individually resurrected. Then after the resurrection will come a spiritual birth, where he is born into an entirely different sphere. And then on him is conferred, in that sphere, the divine title of Father. And it takes God’s only Son to confer the title, for the Son comes and calls you Adonay, my Lord, my Father, in fulfillment of scripture, in fulfillment of the 89 th Psalm.



And then comes the final one when the curtain of the temple is torn from top to bottom and everything is split, all the rocks are split, and all the earth quakes. Then you rise, as you’re told you must rise, in this form that cannot be described. It’s called in the scripture, the Elohim, a celestial being, and the closest they can come to describing the Elohim is a fiery serpent. That’s exactly what you are and feel and see when you rise. Human, yes, but for all the identity of personality, a radical discontinuity of form. Then you rise and the whole world quakes. It’s all within you. The whole drama takes place in the individual. You do not rise from the body; you rise in the body. You do not awaken from the body; you awaken in the body. And the whole thing takes place within the individual.



But tonight, you believe me. And if you didn’t know this was the pearl of great price, and I brought it to you this night, I hope you’ll buy it. But like all the great things of scripture, “Come buy wine, buy milk, without money, without price.” The only price you pay for it—not dollars and cents—you give up your belief in powers outside of Christ Jesus, and Christ Jesus is your own wonderful human Imagination.



Now let us go into the Silence.



Now are there any questions, please?



Q: (inaudible)



A: Did I say that? No, my dear. No, no, no, Shin is made like you would a big W, and there are three prongs. It’s like Neptune’s staff. You know that three prongs of Neptune? You make it that way. The symbol of a Shin is a tooth that consumes, that devours, and it’s also called a flame, a fire; a fire consumes. Well, a Shin is in the name of Jesus. The first three letters of Jesus are the first three in the name of Jehovah, which is Yod He Vau; then you put a Shin, and then you put an Ion. Because, Jehovah, everything is, nothing passes away, but to be a Savior one would have to be able to change. If you could not be changed from what you are, you could not be saved. So the Savior, when Jehovah comes as Savior, a Shin is in his name. That he could transform the lady; she took the Shin and used it in her power when she saw a depressed lady. Could have been that her feet were hurting; she didn’t know what was wrong. Could be standing on her feet all day long. But didn’t ask her what was wrong; she just saw a lady in need of help, and in her mind’s eye, she just saw her radiant and saw her happy. One week later, she could confess in that interval she got some money, a gift out of the nowhere; she inherited it and paid off all bills. If she didn’t have the Shin in her name, then that woman forever would be as she is. But a Savior must have the Shin. So, it’s really a big W.



Q: (inaudible)



A: Well, no, that would not be significant in that sense. No, no, they’re thinking of the trinity, but this is all churchianity. When you see that of the Christ, this is all churchianity, for it’s not in the Bible. But our churches through the ages have developed the most fantastic traditions, which they keep alive. They will die to protect their position, but that’s not scripture. But a Shin is in the name of Jesus, as it is in the name of Jeshua, which is Joshua, which is the same thing as Jesus. Because the last one, Ion, in the name is an eye. It’s the sixteenth letter of the alphabet, which has the value of eye and the numerical value of a seventy. So he sends seventy into the world to really do this work. Not seventy people; that’s eye: to see it seventy times seven. To see it so clearly that you see it and not a power in this world could move you from it. I saw it, I am still seeing it, I will continue to see it until that which I have seen—and I am seeing and will continue to see—is externalized. No wavering. I believe in the reality of the imaginal act, and the day will come that you will see it as something objective to your mortal eye. It will be so vivid in your mind’s eye that you will objectify it.



But the Shin is a flame. It’s a tooth that consumes. And could I not consume in my own mind’s eye unlovely things I see in another, I couldn’t help them. But my ability to completely forget all that I saw them to be and put in its place what I want them to be allows me to save them, to be a savior. And Jesus is Savior. And Jesus Christ is the one who actually has lifted up within himself the power and the wisdom of God, which is Christ. And the day is coming that everyone will move into this world completely subject to our imaginative power. All of us will recognize each other, although the bodies will be trans… in fact, you can’t describe the body, you can’t… completely above the organization of sex. There’s no need for sex as we understand sex, for we create without bodies of this nature. Yet we have a body. As Paul said, “But the body you sow… or, what you sow is not the body which will be, but God gives us a body as he has chosen.” And so the body will be as different from this as the butterfly is from the caterpillar, something attuned to an entirely different realm and yet luminous. I’ve seen it. I became one with it.



Someone said to me, “Neville, how can you dare say that infinite power, infinite wisdom, can be conceived as personal?” Yet in Romans 8 are we not told, “The whole creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God.” God is this power, this infinite creative power, and yet he has sons. And are we not personal? If he’s waiting eagerly for a revealing of his sons, then is he not a person? But I don’t have to rationalize it; I’ve seen him, and God is a person. And the infinite power, how could you personify it and call it a person? I have seen it, and it is man. Infinite power is man. Infinite wisdom is man. I’ve seen them. Stood in the presence of infinite love, and infinite love isn’t some intangible little thing; it’s man, and it’s infinite love. Stood in the presence of infinite power, almightiness, and he talked to me, ordered me, commanded me, and sent me on my way. It was man.



So they will say to me, they’ve asked me, “How are you speaking of God? We speak of the exalted God. How can he be this exalted God?” They couldn’t see him as personal. Well, I tell you that he is. And then one said to me, “Well, tell me, was your Christ once a man?” What can you say to that when you have heard me this night? But to say was? He is the heavenly man. I saw the power: It’s man. And Christ is the power and wisdom of God, and I saw infinite power and infinite wisdom as man. So Christ is the heavenly man. As we are told in the 15 th of 1 st Corinthians, “Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, so shall we bear the image of the man of heaven” (verse 49).

## Key Features Analysis

The powered floor monitor market is filled with a variety of options, each boasting unique functionalities. Understanding the specifications is key to finding the perfect fit for your needs.

**Power Output**

The power output of a powered floor monitor is a critical factor determining its loudness and ability to fill a stage. Measured in watts (W), a higher power rating generally indicates a louder and more capable monitor. Models like the XYZ ProMonitor 15 boast a peak power output of 2000W,making them suitable for larger stages and louder bands. Lower wattage monitors, such as the QRS StageMate 12 with 1000W, are more appropriate for smaller venues or solo performers. Power output is also closely related to the size of the woofer and the efficiency of the amplifier.

**Speaker Configuration**

The speaker configuration refers to the size and type of drivers used in the floor monitor. A typical configuration includes a woofer for low frequencies and a tweeter for high frequencies.The size of the woofer,usually measured in inches,affects the monitor's bass response. A 15-inch woofer, like in the XYZ ProMonitor 15, will deliver a deeper and more powerful bass than a 12-inch woofer. The tweeter type, such as a compression driver or a dome tweeter, influences the clarity and dispersion of high frequencies. Some monitors also include a mid-range driver for improved vocal clarity.

**Frequency Response**

Frequency response is a measure of the range of frequencies that a speaker can reproduce accurately.it is typically expressed in Hertz (Hz) and indicates the lowest and highest frequencies the monitor can handle. A wider frequency response generally means the monitor can reproduce a broader spectrum of sound, resulting in a more accurate and detailed representation of the audio signal.For example,a monitor with a frequency response of 50Hz - 20kHz can reproduce sounds from the lowest bass notes to the highest vocal frequencies.

**Input and Output Options**

The input and output options determine the monitor's connectivity and flexibility in different setups. Most powered floor monitors feature XLR and 1/4-inch inputs for connecting to mixing consoles and instruments. Some models also offer RCA inputs for connecting to consumer audio devices. Output options, such as XLR thru outputs, allow you to daisy-chain multiple monitors together or send the signal to other audio equipment.Additional features like Bluetooth connectivity and built-in mixers can further enhance the functionality and versatility of the monitor.

**enclosure Design and Material**

The enclosure design and material influence the monitor's durability, sound quality, and portability. Floor monitors are typically designed with a slanted cabinet angle to direct the sound upwards towards the performer. The cabinet material can be made of wood, plastic, or a combination of both. Wooden enclosures generally offer better acoustic properties and a more natural sound, while plastic enclosures are lighter and more durable. Some monitors also feature protective grilles to protect the speakers from damage.

**Weight and Portability**

Weight and portability are important considerations, especially for musicians who travel frequently. Powered floor monitors can range in weight from around 20 pounds to over 50 pounds. Lighter monitors are easier to transport and set up, while heavier models may offer more robust construction and higher power output. Features like integrated handles and wheels can also improve portability. Consider the weight and dimensions of the monitor in relation to your transportation capabilities and stage setup requirements.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality powered floor monitor provides notable advantages to performers. These range from improved on-stage interaction to boosted confidence during live shows.

**Enhanced On-Stage Monitoring**

A powered floor monitor provides clear and accurate on-stage monitoring, allowing performers to hear themselves and the rest of the band precisely. This is crucial for maintaining accurate pitch, timing, and overall performance quality. With a dedicated monitor, singers can hear their vocals clearly above the other instruments, ensuring they stay in tune and project their voices effectively. Guitarists can monitor their guitar tone and adjust their playing accordingly. Drummers can maintain a solid rhythm and keep the band in sync.**Improved Performance Quality**

Accurate on-stage monitoring directly translates to improved performance quality.When performers can hear themselves clearly, they are more confident and relaxed, allowing them to focus on their performance. They can make real-time adjustments to their playing or singing, resulting in a tighter and more polished sound. This also fosters better communication between band members, leading to a more cohesive and dynamic performance.

**Reduced Vocal Strain and Fatigue**

Without proper monitoring, singers frequently enough strain their voices to hear themselves above the other instruments, leading to vocal fatigue and potential damage. A powered floor monitor provides a clear and amplified vocal signal, reducing the need to push their voices and allowing them to sing more comfortably and efficiently. This is particularly beneficial for long performances or tours.

**Increased Confidence and Stage presence**

Knowing that you sound good on stage boosts confidence and enhances stage presence. When performers can hear themselves clearly and accurately, they are more likely to engage with the audience and deliver a memorable performance. They can focus on their artistry and connect with the music without worrying about whether they are in tune or in sync with the band.

**Versatile Application**

powered floor monitors are suitable for a wide range of applications, from small clubs and coffee houses to large concert halls and outdoor festivals.They can be used by individual performers, bands, public speakers, and DJs.Their versatility makes them a valuable addition to any live sound setup.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions regarding powered floor monitors.

**What is the ideal power output for a powered floor monitor?**

The ideal power output depends on the size of the venue and the volume of the other instruments. For small clubs and coffee houses, a monitor with 500-1000 watts might potentially be sufficient. For larger stages and louder bands, a monitor with 1000-2000 watts or more is recommended. Consider the overall sound pressure level (SPL) needed for your specific application.

**Should I choose a 12-inch or 15-inch woofer for my floor monitor?**

A 15-inch woofer generally offers a deeper and more powerful bass response than a 12-inch woofer. if you play bass-heavy music or need a monitor with strong low-end performance, a 15-inch woofer is a good choice. However, a 12-inch woofer may be sufficient for most other applications and may offer a more balanced sound. Consider the type of music you play and the overall sound you are trying to achieve.

**How do I prevent feedback with a powered floor monitor?**

Feedback occurs when the sound from the monitor is picked up by the microphone and amplified again, creating a loud squealing noise. To prevent feedback, position the monitor so that it is not directly in front of the microphone. use a microphone with a cardioid or hypercardioid polar pattern, which is less sensitive to sound from the sides and rear. Reduce the gain on the microphone and monitor. Use a graphic EQ to cut frequencies that are prone to feedback.

**Can I use a powered floor monitor as a regular PA speaker?**

While powered floor monitors are primarily designed for on-stage monitoring, they can also be used as regular PA speakers in some situations. However, they are typically optimized for close-range listening and may not have the same dispersion characteristics as dedicated PA speakers. If you need a versatile speaker that can be used for both monitoring and front-of-house applications, consider a model with a switchable monitor/PA mode.

In our fast-paced world, where we are often swept away by a tide of responsibilities, deadlines, and daily routines, the pursuit of happiness sometimes takes a backseat to the more pressing demands of life. Whether it's juggling work commitments, managing family obligations, or maintaining social connections, our schedules can quickly become cluttered, leaving little room for the things that genuinely make our hearts sing. This week, let's take a moment to reflect on the importance of intentionally carving out space for happiness in our lives. After all, if we don't make it a priority, it often gets lost in the chaos of our to-do lists.

#### The Importance of Prioritizing Happiness

Happiness is not merely an emotional state; it is a vital aspect of our overall well-being. Numerous studies suggest that maintaining a positive outlook can enhance our physical health, improve our relationships, and even elevate our productivity in both personal and professional settings. Happiness serves as a catalyst for creativity, resilience, and fulfillment. Yet, despite its profound significance, it’s astonishingly easy for happiness to be overshadowed by life’s demands.

When we view our days through a purely practical lens, defining our worth by our productivity or our ability to tick off items from a to-do list, we run the risk of neglecting our emotional needs. However, cultivating happiness shouldn’t be seen as an indulgence; it is a necessity. Just as we schedule meetings and set deadlines, we must also schedule joy!

#### Making Room for Happiness This Week

1. **Set Intentions**: Take a few moments each morning this week to set positive intentions. Instead of allowing the day to dictate your mood, consciously decide what you want to feel. This could be joy, gratitude, or contentment. Write it down and carry it with you throughout the day as a reminder of what you are focusing on.

2. **Block Time for Joy**: Just as you would schedule meetings or errands, carve out specific times in your schedule dedicated to activities that bring you happiness. This could be as simple as a walk in nature, reading a book, having coffee with a friend, or indulging in a creative hobby. Guard this time fiercely—it’s your space for happy!

3. **Practice Gratitude**: Cultivating gratitude can significantly enhance your sense of happiness. Each night, jot down three things you were grateful for that day, no matter how small. This practice shifts your focus away from the stress and chaos of daily life toward the positives, enhancing your overall sense of well-being.

4. **Connect With Others**: Human connections are a cornerstone of happiness. Reach out to friends, family, or colleagues, even if only for a brief chat or a quick message. Sharing little moments of joy can create a ripple effect that enriches both your life and the lives of those around you.

5. **Be Present**: Mindfulness is key to experiencing happiness. Take a few moments during the day to step back and breathe. Whether you’re savoring a meal, enjoying a conversation, or simply taking in your environment, being present can deepen your appreciation for life’s simple pleasures.

6. **Embrace Forgiveness**: Holding onto negative feelings or grudges can weigh heavily on our hearts. Practice forgiveness—not just towards others but also towards yourself. Letting go of resentment can free up emotional space for happiness.

7. **Limit Negativity**: Be mindful of your media consumption and the people you surround yourself with. Negativity can be contagious, and limiting exposure to pessimistic influences can make room for more uplifting experiences and interactions.

#### Conclusion: A Commitment to Joy

As you embark on this week, remember that happiness is not an afterthought but a priority that warrants our attention and care. By intentionally making space for happy, we acknowledge its vital role in our lives and our well-being. The world may be busy, but that doesn’t mean our hearts can’t be filled with joy. Dedicating even just a small portion of your week to what makes you happy can create a profound impact, not only on your day-to-day life but also on your overall outlook. Embrace happiness as a fundamental part of your existence, and watch how it transforms your life for the better. Let this week be a reminder that in the grand scheme of life, our personal happiness is worth every bit of the space we create for it.

1l41eqq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l41eqq,Some impressions from my trip to the North Cape in April/May,"I started my trip in mid-April in Oslo and finished by taking the night train from Rovaniemi to Helsinki, followed by the ferry to Germany and the train back to Switzerland. For most nights I was able to camp; in the cities, I usually got a cheap hotel.

**My Route:**

**Oslo - Trondheim:**  
It took me some time to get used to cycling with that much weight. Although in the end, I was glad I brought most of the clothes since some nights were pretty cold (-10°C). This part had some decent climbs but was pretty empty. Also I didn't realize that all shops would be closed due to the easter weekend so I mostly ate my own food and some junk food from the occasional gas station.

**Sandnessjøen - Finnsnes:**  
I decided to skip some kilometers to be on the safe side (which in the end turned out not to have been necessary) and took the Hurtigruten to Sandnessjøen. From there, the scenery really picked up. The Lofoten were stunning, but I'm glad I went off-season. The roads were almost empty. I had to change my route a bit since some ferries weren’t running yet. In Finnsnes, I took the Hurtigruten to Tromsø because I needed a new spoke for my poor back wheel.

**Tromsø - North Cape:**  
I had some very bad weather the first few days, but luckily it cleared up later. There were some tunnels that were technically closed to bicycles, but the route I wanted to take was buried under a meter-thick blanket of snow. So in the end, I had to cycle through some pretty long tunnels with no shoulder. Luckily, the traffic volume was quite low. The plateau after Alta was probably the hardest part of the whole trip, with very strong crosswinds that forced me to push my bike uphill for a while. The dreaded North Cape Tunnel wasn’t that bad; probably because I’d already cycled through much worse tunnels earlier in the trip. The North Cape itself was nice enough, but the way there was much more interesting.

**Kirkenes - Rovaniemi:**  
After taking the Hurtigruten one last time to get some rest and avoid the strong wind and tunnels, I started the last part of my trip in Kirkenes. The change in scenery compared to Norway was pretty drastic; endless roads through forest with almost no shops (or any other people, for that matter). With nothing else to do and almost no hills, I was able to make good progress, which allowed me to take a small detour to Sweden for one day before finishing my tour back in Rovaniemi.

**Some random observations:**

* Barmitts are awesome. I rarely had to wear gloves underneath them.
* Rain gear makes for a pretty good insulation layer in the winter.
* Norwegian drivers are the most courteous I’ve encountered so far. I didn’t get honked at once, and they always moved to the other lane when overtaking.
* Norway is indeed very expensive, even though I mostly bought food from supermarkets.
* Finnish supermarkets were great. Free toilets, cheap coffee, a place to charge my devices and refill my bottles.
* Deutsche Bahn lived up to it's reputation

But rent and standard of living can be expensive (a lot of people will say I’m looking in the wrong places, but we’re looking all over Chicago proper and it feels like the space is either a pit made for college kids or it’s 6k a month).

We are considering moving somewhere where we don’t have to compromise on what we want for housing (nice home ~1200 feet or slightly larger, small yard, 3 bedroom - open to condos and townhomes). Would love a place that can be walkable to a coffee shop or some restaurants - being walkable is our favorite part of Chicago. 

Love having all four seasons, but open to other options, just ideally not a sweltering place, so our doggos can go for a run outside with me on a nice day. But oh my I love a nice rainy day or snow day, but could be so down with a place that’s 75 year round. 

I feel like trying to find a 3 bedroom in so many places can be insane (Boston, Chicago, parts of PNW for example) for renting or buying. Like 5+ grand a month seems bonkers but maybe I’m just looking in the wrong places?

Ideally would like to avoid the south, like Texas and Florida due to political and education misalignment.

I got it from the floor of a produce junction, kept it in this same bright / usually bright corner away from direct light. I kept it in a self watering pot that dried out easily and let it dry between waterings because it was a cute pot. Sometimes I might stick it in the window. But it even grew happily with the air conditioner in the same room. 

This winter it struggled. I tried spraying the leaves a little. I tried using plant food. Watering more. Drying out more. A window. A new pot. When I put it in its clay pot with new soil recently I noticed like no roots? Like a puberty beard of 5-7 straggler roots that were super short. I am now spritzing with vinegar to keep the soil more acidic? I know it doesn’t like to sit wet, so I try to dry it out between waterings but also water well. 

Any way you slice it, some leaves die looking dry/some look washed out and maybe overwatered? It’s summery again but it’s looking like it is not going to make it. The leaves are still dying and it’s half its size now from when it started shooting up last year.

It was the second week of school. My shoes had holes in them. I was holding a free lunch tray in the cafeteria line, and some kid behind me whispered loud enough for everyone to hear:

>

Laughter. Eyes. Pity. I remember the heat rushing to my face. I remember not eating that day. Not because I wasn’t hungry, but because shame is an appetite killer.

For years, that word followed me like a curse. Pauper was scribbled on my locker. Shouted across parking lots. Whistled into bus windows. It wasn’t just a word; it was a reminder that I was less. That my life didn’t come with comfort, or clean clothes, or any kind of cushion.

>

We lived off charity. I knew the inside of every church pantry and the smell of every secondhand coat. My mother did her best. But we were always a few dollars from disaster.

And now? I’m 47. I live in Hawaii. I have five beautiful kids, a wife who still looks at me like I’m made of gold, and a home filled with everything I once thought I’d never deserve.

But it took me decades to make peace with the boy who was called pauper. To look at him not with shame, but with awe. Because he endured. He survived the mocking, the hunger, the lonely winters, the ache of wishing he had more.

He didn’t die in that cafeteria. He grew. And he built a life no one saw coming.

A few months ago, I found Own A Word. I saw that you could own a word forever. And for the first time, I didn’t flinch when I thought of that word.  
Pauper.

It felt… different.  
It felt like something I wanted to take back. Not as a weapon. Not as revenge. But as a monument to everything I overcame.

So I bought it. Pauper. In my name.  
Because that word no longer belongs to the kids who threw it like stones. It belongs to the man who turned it into fuel.

I sit here now, on my porch, coffee in hand, sun on my face. I watch my daughter dance across the grass. I listen to my wife laugh in the kitchen. And I think of that boy with the empty lunch tray.

*I want to tell him something.*  
*You were never a pauper. You were a king in waiting. And now, you own the word. Forever.*

Holy heck this is the most fun I've had with a game since, dare I say it, Nioh 2!

I checked my old save file for Nioh 2. After the reveal of Nioh 3, I am planning to go back and do a full playthrough again because I never actually got to the depths and because  I need something to keep me occupied until Nioh 3 releases and I had like 400 hours on one of my saves. That's when all the fond memories of playing the hell out of it during the pandemic came rushing back. 

Long story short the plan was to just play the new demo for a couple of hours, get a good night's sleep and then play more tomorrow but it was too good and now the sun is shining, the birds and chirping and IDK what to do. 

At this point, I'm thinking it would make the most sense to just put on a pot of coffee, make some pancakes and keep freaking playing until I literally can't keep my eyes open. 

I honestly am just so hyped, this could easily be Team Ninja's best game ever. 

I will say I was a little thrown off by the style switching at first but after a while, I started to dig the new system and am glad they made some changes. I am glad it's not mechanically the same as Nioh 2 or Nioh 1. Instead, Nioh 3 is shaping up to be the greatest hits of all their games wrapped into one massive package. Also, I am digging Nioh combat in an open-world setting. Finally, the vision I always wanted for the game has been implemented! No more immersion breaking home screens between missions.

As a huge SekiroSoulsBorne fan, I was pretty disappointed by Elden Ring overall because of the repetitive and extremely simple nature of Darksouls combat. I felt like it was a huge step backward for Fromsoft after the ingenious masterwork that Sekiro turned out to be. That being said I loved the world and exploration so much I stuck with it to the end, although I could never bring myself to complete a second playthrough as once you discover everything the actual gameplay ends up being a huge slog. 

Nioh 3 alleviates that issue for me. Team Ninja seems to be making the game all of us fans of this genre have been dreaming of for years.

I've had my LP3 for about a month now and I've been absolutely loving it! I've been using it in ""hybrid"" mode, where I access the Android layer for tools that aren't currently supported by Light. (You can learn more in r/ModifiedLightPhones)

Many of us in the ""modding-and-hacking"" Discord channel have been discussing the development of apps styled like LightOS. Since I'm on my summer break, I thought I'd have a go at learning Android app development. For my first project, I developed Passes to store barcodes, such as supermarket loyalty cards and train tickets. 

That was my first time ever developing for Android and using Expo/React Native. Code for Passes can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/vandamd/passes). Please excuse the messy code, I've learnt a lot since then!

This leads me onto my latest project, a weather app for the Light Phone III:

[Screenshots of Weather on the Light Phone III](https://preview.redd.it/spvcq6r0q35f1.png?width=3918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4698286b7e3c313894cc29b510963aeedc40817)

For weather data, I use [Open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/), a lovely open-source weather API. 

I've tried my best to follow the design of LightOS by referencing screenshots from the device to create components. I was also greatly inspired by this concept produced by u/\_hainezo, see [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LightPhone/comments/1d79nn5/concept_unofficial_the_weather_tool_by_me_thats/). 

The app is open-source, feel free to have a look at the Github repo [here](https://github.com/vandamd/weather) and make contributions. The .apk file can be found on the Github Releases page [here](https://github.com/vandamd/weather/releases/latest). Feedback is welcomed and encouraged!

If you find the app useful, please consider supporting me with a [coffee](https://coff.ee/vandam) :)

1l411j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1l411j6/15_years_deep/,15 years deep,"I don't know what I'm looking for here. I'm fairly new to Reddit and this is my very first post.  I have read through other posts here in this community and I guess that's what has given me the courage to write my own.  I am a 33F and have been with my partner since I was 18.  We have one child together and she is about to be 11 years old.  In the beginning before our daughter was concieved, our realtionship was rocky.  I was freshly 18 years old and he was 22.  As soon as we met, he never let me out of his sight.  I enjoyed him at first as we both enjoyed some of the same activites, food, music etc. When I say he never let me out of his sight, I'm serious.  He even had difficulty letting me go to work and a few months in, I quit my (amazing, great paying) job to make him happy. Things were rocky because there was a constant push-pull between the two of us.  Every normal thing I  wanted/needed to do was a problem with him and at first I was always eager to fight back and this caused the push/pull. 

Very quickly, he made it clear that all of my friends were a waste of my time. He convinced me that they were all using me and taking advantage of my kindness and that they did not care about me as a person.  He somehow managed to convince me that my BEST friend since the age of 5 was turning into a toxic person in my life and I didn't need her anymore.  He would talk badly about my mother(who was/still is my very best & only friend left), he would tell me that she's crazy and doesn't treat me like a daughter, the list goss on.  This is infact 100% untrue as my mother has been my rock and the only person getting me through these last 15 years with him and I know that me being in this relationship has just absolutely destroyed her inside and out.  I've been isolated from all the friends I once had since the beginning and have had no opportunity to make any new ones. I turned 21 during this relationship and still to this day, I have never stepped foot in a bar.  I'm not a drinker anyway but like I was robbed the experience of sitting in a bar and ordering a drink on my 21st bday and still have yet to ever. Just to please him. I don't know wtf is wrong with me. He has taken simple life experiences that most don't think twice about away from me. 

I am not allowed to have a facebook, instagram, tiktok, snap, nothing. I'm used to it by now as he had me delete it all soon after we met but at times it does feel like I am living under a freaking rock.  He doesn't want me to go anywhere alone and this causes me to have to drag my daughter everywhere with me after school to get things done.  If by some chance I do end up not being able to avoid going some place without her, he accuses me the entire time of being with my ""secret boyfriend"".  Please know that this is a totally made up person in his head and I have never stepped out on him once.  There is NOTHING that I can say to him to make him understand there is no secret person.  I will say things like, when would I meet someone? And how would I meet him? When would I talk to him? This is a totally unrealistic dillusion he has and I have to fight him every day that it's not happening. It has gotten to the point that I don't even want to go anywhere alone because I do not want to have this back and forth exchange fighting with him over a made up person anymore.  When we go places togther, he makes me feel like I can't look at anyone else, he criticizes me if I adjust my hair- saying I'm fluffing my hair for whoever is looking.  He accuses me of always paying extra close attention to certain makes and models of cars and says that I'm clearly looking to see if my ""secret boyfriend"" is driving by. I literally don't even bother looking out the window anymore if we are in the same car. There is not one thing that I can do right.  

I am just trying to paint somewhat of a clear picture in hopes someone can say something to help me help myself and daughter out of this mess because I truly just can't live like this anymore.  There are so many more tidbits to share but it's all so overwhelming, I can't even get it all out. I'm critisized if I suddenly like a new song that I typically wouldn't like- he accuses me of changing and being shady- all over music choices. 

 Over the course of my daughters life, he has encouraged me to be a stay at home mom and for the first 2.5 of her life I was.  I got lucky and started watching someone else's child in my home and this was a little source of money for me.  He would keep track of how much I was paid and when and what I was spending money on.  He would tell me what I need to buy for our daughter every time I was paid and I listened to him because it just made my life easier.  This job ended for me when Covid began and this was around the same time my child was starting kindergarten.  She went to school for a few months before the Covid lockdown and during that time I managed to find a new (less than ideal) job for myself at a local nursing home.  My partner was OK with this as I was working with older people and he felt no threat.  Once the lockdown was official, my daughter could no longer attend school in person and I was right back to being stuck at home, making no money of my own and slipping right back into this way of life he wanted for us.  I managed to stay strong and survive most of her elementary school days just staying home and became the textbook stay home mother. All the child raising, cooking, cleaning, attending school functions, shopping, appointments were on me. I should note that they've always been on me even during the times I had a job of my own. He supports our daughter financially and that's it.  He has never attended a school function, sporting event, appointment for her, nothing. He could not tell you the name of our daughter's teacher if his life depended on it. He has never helped me with any of it and that's fine because I truly do not want his help with any of it anyway.  

2 years ago, I applied for a work from home artistan job for a local artist and I got the job.  I worked at home for 2 weeks but she loved my work so much (!!) that she asked me to come work in person with her at her shop. He was irate. He said I shouldn't do it as it would put all the household chores behind and take my time away from our daughter. Mind you, the in person hours of the job were flexible for me and during school hours only. This job paid me very well.  I finally felt like I had real hope of saving some of my own money and getting out.  I was never honest with my partner about what I was making because this time, I was saving most of it so that I could stand on my own two feet with my daughter without him.  Every week, he would delegate to me what I needed to buy for him, the house and our daughter with the little money he thought I was making.  The light at the end of this tunnel was getting brighter and brighter and I swear I could see the other side until 2 months ago.  We had an enormous argument over summertime childcare so that I could keep this job.  He demanded I quit because he wouldn't pay for any summer camps for her.  I ended up paying for half the summers worth of camp but this was difficult as I was desparatrly trying to hang on to the savings he wasn't aware I had. I went to great lengths to hide this. No mail from my bank is sent to my home- it is all electronic and I kept it all in a savings account not attached to my debit card obviously so the secret stayed safe and still has but that savings has dwindled because well, life. Since I wasn't willing to shell out all of the money it would cost to cover care for the whole summer, I gave up and I quit my fucking job. Like an absolute idiot. He won again.  I have been living the same old stay at home mom life for the last 2 months and I have hit a breaking point. I know that this is all so wrong. I am scared of how I will manage without his financial help for our daughter.  He tells me if we separate he won't help financially and I can't see myself seeking child support because I do not want to even share my daughter with this man.  He has never taken care of her. He doesn't have a parental bone in his body and if I had to let her go with him for weekends, nights, whatever, I would be devistated and I think she would be too. They love each other but I am her go to. We are best friends and I shield her from all of this the best I can but she can see what he is doing to me as she gets older.

 We are average middle class but we live in a small town with a mix of midd & upper class income families. My daughter fits in quite well and thanks to his financial support, she never goes without.  I am scared to disrupt the apple cart and the possibility of her going without because I won't be able to maintain this lifestyle for her and this fear is crippling to me. 

My current state of mind and completely being fed up with all of this is relatively new and here is what really changed everything.  9 days ago, I had to get all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed.  I have had a less than ideal recovery and this man has not spoken to me all 9 days.  I told him on day 2 how much I was struggling and needed help getting our daughter to and from places and help get things ready for all of her end of the year school activities. He refused.  I can truly say I have never suffered this much.  The pain, the healing, I've had some bumps in recovery and have been back to the surgeon 3 times during emergency hours for help and this man won't talk to me.  Although, he did comment on how awful I look with the swelling and bruising. I didn't do anything except get my wisdom teeth removed!!!!! I have never been down like this and the silent treatment and lack of care has pushed me over the edge. My mother has been my partner through all of this. She was the one missing work to help me. She was the one reassuring me all night and day that I will be okay.  She had a bit of a back and forth match with him over his behavior and he told her to fuck herself and walked out.  I have just hit a point that I don't feel I can come back from.  I do everything for this man. His laundry, coordinate his appointments, remind him what days his bills are due, I wake him up at 5:30AM every day for work, I make his coffee, I meal prep all of his work food, he comes home to a warm home cooked meal every night. I really do not know what else I can do to make him happy and treat me decent.  It feels that there isn't anything I can do.  I have starved pretty much the entirety of this dental procedure recovery and yesterday, my mother brought me 2 slices of pizza to try and eat with my front teeth. I was able to eat it and felt alive again. He came home SO angry like how dare I have 2 slices of pizza and he has none.  His dinner was plated and waiting for him but I cooked it because I didn't plan on the pizza from my mother. He made me feel so badly for eating that pizza and not saving a slice for him.  I have lost 16 pounds since 5/27 and I needed to eat the pizza.  I just give up.  This all feels bigger than me. If you have made it this far reading this post, I genuinely appreciate it.  I know it's spotty and I have left so, so much out because I can hardly get my thoughts in order to get it all out.

1l411em,https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/1l411em/potential_unexpected_benefit_to_living_the_word/,Potential unexpected benefit to living the Word of Wisdom and drug resistance depression treatment.,"Quick preamble...My wife has struggled with depression for a long time. Early on she could manage fine but after the birth of our last child her symptoms had really skyrocketed. Crippling negative self talk, suicidal ideation, unable to feel joy for life, etc.  very much impacting her daily life. 

Medicines that used to work are no longer working, and her therapist was concerned about continuing to up the dosage. 

So they suggested a newish treatment option called TMS ( Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) which has been shown to reduce depression in patients when medication is no longer working. 

In layman's terms the basic idea is by using strong magnetic stimulation they can help reform neural pathways in the areas known to regulate mood. The process is noninvasive, but does require daily treatments for like 8 weeks. So it's a commitment. 

Now here is where the tender mercy and unexpected blessings of living the WoW comes into play. 

TMS has a success rate of 50% in national studies, but at this particular clinic they have a 80% success rate that patients see improvements. It's not a cure all but improvement is better then nothing. 

When meeting with the psychiatrist he was taken back when he was asking my wife about her stimulant consumption. ( we live in Southern California so a relatively smaller LDS population) 
He got really excited to know that my wife has never consumed alcohol, does not use pot, and has never consumed coffee any more then trying it back in her ""rebellious years"" 

See the use of stimulants are some of major the factors that brought down the nation average, as well as cause patients to be delayed experiencing any benefits until several weeks into treatments. 

The Dr. fully expects that my wife will be way on the higher end of the benefits spectrum and the effects should hopefully last for years. 


Can you imagine the hope that kind of news can bring someone suffering from such crippling depression. It has brought she such a spiritual confirmation that god loves us and watches out for us. In a time when for her feeling the sprit has been very hard at times. She is so excited to begin treatment which starts today!

I am grateful to the Lord for this unexpected benefit to living what often times is seen as a arbitrary restriction. 

Again we get this isn't a cure all. But hey if it keeps my wife alive and with our family instead of the ideation she has been experiencing than it will be well worth it! ",33,1749134794.0,latterdaysaints,10,0.95,False

1l40ztm,https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/1l40ztm/excerpts_from_the_book_men_explain_things_to_me/,"Excerpts from the book ""Men Explain Things to Me""","So, there's the essay Men Explain Things to Me by R. Solnit that caused the term mansplaining to be coined, and then there's her the book with the same title which contains several of her essays on gender, feminism, human history, and social justice. 

Before each chapter is an interesting artwork related to the topic of made by Ana Teresa Fernandez. 

I recommend the book and want to share some excerpts I found especially interesting and important. 

# Men Explain Things to Me 2008

After all, Women Strike for Peace was founded by women who were tired of making the coffee and “doing the typing and not having any voice or decision-making role in the antinuclear movement of the 1950s. Most women fight wars on two fronts, one for whatever the putative topic is and one simply for the right to speak, to have ideas, to be acknowledged to be in possession of facts and truths, to have value, to be a human being. Things have gotten better, but this war won’t end in my lifetime. I’m still fighting it, for myself certainly, but also for all those younger women who have something to say, in the hope that they will get to say it. (p. 10-11)

# The Longest War 2013

Never mind workplace violence, let’s go home. So many men murder their partners and former partners that we have well over a thousand homicides of that kind a year—meaning that every three years the death toll tops 9/11’s casualties, though no one declares a war on this particular kind of terror. (Another way to put it: the more than 11,766 corpses from domestic-violence homicides between 9/11 and 2012 exceed the number of deaths of victims on that day and all American soldiers killed in the “war on terror.”) If we talked about crimes like these and why they are so common, we’d have to talk about what kinds of profound change this society, or this nation, or nearly every nation needs. If we talked about it, we’d be talking about masculinity, or male roles, or maybe patriarchy, and we don’t talk much about that.

Instead, we hear that American men commit murder-suicides—at the rate of about twelve a week—because the economy is bad, though they also do it when the economy is good; or that those men in India murdered the bus rider because the poor resent the rich, while other rapes in India are explained by how the rich exploit the poor; and then there are those ever-popular explanations: mental problems and intoxicants—and for jocks, head injuries. The latest spin is that lead exposure was responsible for a lot of our violence, except that both genders are exposed and one commits most of the violence. The pandemic of violence always gets explained as anything but gender, anything but what would seem to be the broadest explanatory pattern of all. (p. 23-25)

This essay cites a lot of statistics on violence.  


# Grandmother Spider 2014 - VI

In Argentina during the “dirty war” from 1976 to 1983, the military junta was said to “disappear” people. They disappeared dissidents, activists, left-wingers, Jews, both men and women. Those to be disappeared were, if at all possible, taken secretly, so that even the people who loved them might not know their fate. Fifteen thousand to thirty thousand Argentines were thus eradicated. People stopped talking to their neighbors and their friends, silenced by the fear that anything, anyone, might betray them. Their existence grew ever thinner as they tried to protect themselves against nonexistence. The word disappear, a verb, became a noun as so many thousands were transformed into the disappeared, los desaparecidos, but the people who loved them kept them alive. The first voices against this disappearance, the first who overcame their fear, spoke up, and became visible, were those of mothers. They were called Las Madres de la Plaza de Mayo. Their name came from the fact that they were the mothers of the disappeared and that they began appearing in a place that represented the very heart of the country—in front of the Casa Rosa, the presidential mansion, at the Plaza de Mayo in the capital, Buenos Aires – and having appeared, they refused to go away. Forbidden to sit, they walked. Though they would be attacked, arrested, interrogated, forced out of this most public of public places, they returned again and again to testify openly to their grief, their fury, and to mount their demand that their children and grandchildren be returned. They wore white kerchiefs embroidered with the names of their children and the date of their disappearances. Motherhood was an emotional and biological tie that the generals then in charge of the country could not portray as merely left wing or as criminal. It was a cover for a new kind of politics, as it had been for the US group Women Strike for Peace, founded in the shadow of the Cold War in 1961, when dissent was still portrayed as sinister, as communist. Motherhood and respectability became the armor, the costume, in which these women assaulted in one case the generals and in the other, a nuclear weapons program and war itself. The role was a screen behind which they had a limited kind of freedom of movement in a system in which no one was truly free. (p. 75-76) 



# Woolf's Darkness: embracing the inexplicable 2009 - Liberations

Woolf liberates the text, the imagination, the fictional character, and then demands that liberty for ourselves, most particularly for women. This gets to the crux of the Woolf that has been most exemplary for me: she is always celebrating a liberation that is not official, institutional, rational, but a matter of going beyond the familiar, the safe, the known into the broader world. Her demands for liberation for women were not merely so that they could do some of the institutional things men did (and women now do, too), but to have full freedom to roam, geographically and imaginatively.

She recognizes that this requires various practical forms of freedom and power—recognizes it in A Room of One’s Own, too often remembered as an argument for rooms and incomes, though it demands also universities and a whole world via the wonderful, miserable tale of Judith Shakespeare, the playwright’s doomed sister: “She could get no training in her craft. Could she even get her dinner in a tavern or roam the streets at midnight?” Dinner in taverns, streets at midnight, the freedom of the city are crucial elements of freedom, not to define an identity but to lose it. Perhaps the protagonist of her novel Orlando, who lives for centuries, slipping from one gender to another, embodies her ideal of absolute freedom to roam, in consciousness, identity, romance, and place. (p. 101-102)



# Pandora's Box and the Volunteer Police Force 2014 - Thinking out of the box

We have so much further to go, but looking back at how far we’ve come can be encouraging. Domestic violence was mostly invisible and unpunished until a heroic effort by feminists to out it and crack down on it a few decades ago. Though it now generates a significant percentage of the calls to police, enforcement has been crummy in most places—but the ideas that a husband has the right to beat his wife and that it’s a private matter are not returning anytime soon. The genies are not going back into their bottles. And this is, really, how revolution works. Revolutions are first of all of ideas. The great anarchist thinker David Graeber recently wrote,

What is a revolution? We used to think we knew. Revolutions were seizures of power by popular forces aiming to transform the very nature of the political, social, and economic system in the country in which the revolution took place, usually according to some visionary dream of a just society. Nowadays, we live in an age when, if rebel armies do come sweeping into a city, or mass uprisings overthrow a dictator, it’s unlikely to have any such implications; when profound social transformation does occur—as with, say, the rise of feminism—it’s likely to take an entirely different form. It’s not that revolutionary dreams aren’t out there. But contemporary revolutionaries rarely think they can bring them into being by some modern-day equivalent of storming the Bastille. At moments like this, it generally pays to go back to the history one already knows and ask: Were revolutions ever really what we thought them to be?

Graeber argues that they were not—that they were not primarily seizures of power in a single regime, but ruptures in which new ideas and institutions were born, and the impact spread. As he puts it, “the Russian Revolution of 1917 was a world revolution ultimately responsible for the New Deal and European welfare states as much as for Soviet communism.” Which means that the usual assumption that Russian revolution only led to disaster can be upended. He continues, “The last in the series was the world revolution of 1968—which, much like 1848, broke out almost everywhere, from China to Mexico, seized power nowhere, but nonetheless changed everything. This was a revolution against state bureaucracies, and for the inseparability of personal and political liberation, whose most lasting legacy will likely be the birth of modern feminism. (p. 114-115)

The Volunteer Police Force (subchapter)

A volunteer police force tries to keep women in their place or put them back in it. The online world is full of mostly anonymous rape and death threats for women who stick out—who, for instance, participate in online gaming or speak up on controversial issues, or even for the woman who recently campaigned to put women’s images on British banknotes (an unusual case, in that many of those who threatened her were actually tracked down and brought to justice). As the writer Caitlin Moran tweeted: “For those who say, ‘why complain– just block?’—on a big troll day, it can be 50 violent/rape messages an hour.

Maybe there is a full-fledged war now, not of the sexes—the division is not that simple, with conservative women and progressive men on different sides—but of gender roles. It’s evidence that feminism and women continue achieving advances that threaten and infuriate some people. Those rape and death threats are the blunt response; the decorous version is all those articles Faludi and N+1 cite telling women who we are and what we may aspire to—and what we may not. 

And the casual sexism is always there to rein us in, too: a Wall Street Journal editorial blaming fatherless children on mothers throws out the term “female careerism.” Salon writer Amanda Marcotte notes, “Incidentally, if you Google ‘female careerism,’ you get a bunch of links, but if you Google ‘male careerism,’ Google asks if you really meant ‘male careers’ or even ‘mahle careers.’ ‘Careerism’—the pathological need to have paid employment—is an affliction that only affects women, apparently.

1l40zoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1l40zoa/preworkouts_exposed_what_the_labels_dont_tell_you/,Pre-Workouts EXPOSED: What the Labels Don’t Tell You (Caffeine ≠ Gains),"What do you get when you mix caffeine, beta-alanine, creatine, and a mystery “pump matrix” in one scoop? Either a god tier workout or a full body freak out. Depends on the day. If you’ve ever dry scooped a pre and then questioned your life choices 15 minutes later, you’re not alone. Understanding pre workout ingredients and their side effects is crucial before choosing any pre workout supplements. Let’s break down the good, the bad, and the genuinely unhinged side of pre workouts.

The first time I tried pre workout was about a year ago an experiment because all my gym bros were on it and swore by the stuff.

**Fact**: it did give me a mental boost and a serious jolt of energy.

**Fun fact:** it also made me feel like I was being electrocuted from the inside. The tingling was so intense I jumped into the shower mid workout, hoping water would somehow fix my beta-alanine meltdown (*spoiler: it didn’t*). My heart was racing like it wanted out, I was sweating bullets, and sprinting around the hall like a golden retriever on Red Bull. Full zoomies mode. I’ll admit I might have a dash of undiagnosed ADHD, which probably didn’t help.

#TLDR 

Pre workout supplements can help improve energy, focus, endurance and power output. The effects depend heavily on the ingredients and their doses.

Key ingredients that actually work:
* Caffeine (150 to 300 mg): Increases alertness and reduces perceived effort. Too much can cause anxiety, jitters or trouble sleeping.

* Beta Alanine (3.2 to 6.4 g): Helps delay fatigue by buffering lactic acid. Common side effect is skin tingling.

* Creatine Monohydrate (3 to 5 g): Supports strength, recovery and high intensity effort. Usually well tolerated.

* Citrulline Malate (6 to 8 g): Improves blood flow and muscle pumps. Can cause mild stomach issues in high doses.

* L Tyrosine, Theanine, Taurine: Support focus, calmness, hydration and endurance.

* Other stimulants like Yohimbine, Synephrine and Theacrine can increase energy but often come with more side effects like elevated heart rate, anxiety or digestive discomfort.

Some pre workouts are well dosed and research backed. Others use proprietary blends to hide weak formulas or risky doses. Always check the label, know what each compound does and start small if you’re new or stimulant sensitive.


# Pre Workout Ingredients: Complete Breakdown

So what exactly turns a scoop of pre workout into the gym version of rocket fuel? What makes it pre workout and not just glorified flavored caffeine? Unlike whatever cocktail of toxicity and narcissism turned your girlfriend into your ex, there’s a specific brew behind the buzz. Let’s break down the not so secret ingredients that give pre workouts their magic what’s actually in that scoop, what each compound does, how much you *should* be taking, and why some blends feel like dark wizardry in disguise. Time to dissect the potion.

**Caffeine**: Boosts alertness, focus, endurance, and lowers perceived exertion. Optimal dose is **3–6 mg/kg body weight (roughly 150–300 mg)**. Overuse can lead to **jitters, anxiety, insomnia, elevated heart rate, and dependency**.

* **Beta-Alanine**: Buffers lactic acid, which delays muscle fatigue. The ideal dose is **3.2–6.4 grams per day**. Can cause **tingling (paraesthesia), flushing, or mild skin irritation**.
* **Creatine Monohydrate**: Helps regenerate ATP, enhancing strength and power output. The effective dose is **3–5 grams per day**. Rare side effects include **water retention, bloating, and mild gastrointestinal discomfort**. [More on Creatine Monohydrate →](https://turbulencegains.com/creatine-monohydrate/)
* **L-Citrulline Malate**: Increases nitric oxide for better pumps, blood flow, and endurance. The optimal dose is **6–8 grams** in a **1:2 citrulline to malate ratio**. Overdosing may cause **GI upset and flatulence**.
* **L-Arginine**: An older pump ingredient that’s less bioavailable than citrulline. Needs **6–10 grams** to be effective. May result in **poor absorption and gastrointestinal discomfort**.
* **L-Tyrosine**: Enhances cognitive performance, especially under stress. The ideal dosage is **500–2,000 mg**. High doses can lead to **headaches and nausea**.
* **Taurine**: Aids hydration, reduces cramps, and supports endurance. The recommended dose is **1–2 grams**. Rare side effects include **hypotension or sedation in sensitive individuals**.
* **Theanine**: Balances out caffeine’s harshness by promoting calm without drowsiness. Take **100–200 mg**, ideally in a **1:1 ratio with caffeine**. Occasionally causes **mild drowsiness at high doses**.
* **Theacrine**: A caffeine-like stimulant that lasts longer and builds less tolerance. Dose ranges from **100–300 mg**. Side effects are similar to caffeine but usually milder — **anxiety and irritability**.
* **Yohimbine**: A stimulant and fat-loss aid that enhances adrenaline and blood flow. Effective at **0.2 mg/kg (up to \~15 mg/day)**. Side effects include **high blood pressure, anxiety, panic attacks**, and it’s **banned in several countries**.
* **Synephrine (Bitter Orange)**: Used for fat loss and energy. Dosed at **10–20 mg**. It can cause **heart palpitations and dizziness**, and is **banned in some countries**.
* **Glycerol (HydroMax or Mono)**: Promotes hyperhydration, leading to better pumps and endurance. Doses: **1–3 grams (HydroMax)** or **10–20 grams (Glycerol Monostearate)**. Side effects include **bloating and diarrhea**, especially if not taken with enough water.
* **B-Vitamins**: Support energy metabolism and neurotransmitter function. Dosage varies depending on type (e.g., B6, B12, niacin). Overuse may cause **flushing (niacin), nausea (B6,)** but generally **safe in moderation**.
* **Nitrates (Beetroot extract)**: Increase nitric oxide for improved endurance and blood flow. Best taken at **400–800 mg of nitrates (\~6–8 mmol)**. Can cause **beet-colored urine and GI upset**.
* **Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium)**: Help replenish salts lost through sweat and prevent cramping. Ideal doses: **200–400 mg sodium**, **100–200 mg potassium**. Excessive intake may cause **hypernatremia**, though rare.

# The Good: What Research Says Works

Alright, let’s kick things off with the good because not all pre workouts supplements are just colorful sugar bombs that make you jitter like you’ve had three espressos and zero chill. When the stars align and the science backs it up, these bad boys can turn you into a gym superhero more energy, sharper focus, and strength gains that make you feel like you might just bench press a small car (or at least a hefty suitcase). So buckle up, because here’s the legit science on why pre workouts can be your workout’s best friend.

# 1. Pre Workout Supplements Boost Sprint Endurance and Energy System Efficiency

Figueiredo, C., Lira, F.S., Rossi, F.E. *et al.* Multi-ingredient pre workout supplementation changes energy system contribution and improves performance during high-intensity intermittent exercise in physically active individuals: a double-blind and placebo controlled study. *J Int Soc Sports Nutr* 17, 30 (2020).

[**Read Study**](https://rdcu.be/en02o)

**What they did:**

* **Participants**: 12 recreationally active males
* **Design**: Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled crossover
* **Protocol**: Repeated 15 second maximal treadmill sprints interspersed with 15 second rest until exhaustion
* **Supplement**: MIPS containing caffeine (300 mg), creatine (3.5 g), beta alanine (2 g), citrulline malate (6 g), arginine, tyrosine, taurine, and B vitamins
* **Placebo**: Flavor matched maltodextrin beverage

**Key findings:**

* Time to exhaustion increased by 18% (mean 20 min vs. 17.0 min placebo)
* The number of sprints completed increased by 14% (mean 41 vs 36)
* ATP CP and oxidative energy system contributions were significantly higher (+28% and +24%) in the MIPS condition
* Glycolytic system contribution increased, but not significantly

**Bottom line:**

If your workouts feel like your gas tank empties in five minutes flat, this kind of pre can squeeze out extra laps before the crash. It taps into your body's fast and clean fuel systems. Not magic, but definitely more juice in the engine.

# 2. Pre Workout Increases Focus and Energy Without Strength Gains

Kedia, A.W., Hofheins, J.E., Habowski, S.M., Ferrando, A.A., Gothard, M.D., Lopez, H.L. (2014). Effects of a Pre workout Supplement on Lean Mass, Muscular Performance, Subjective Workout Experience and Biomarkers of Safety. International Journal of Medical Sciences, 11(2), 116-126.

[**Read study**](https://www.medsci.org/v11p0116.htm)

**What they did:**

* **Participants**: 43 resistance trained men and women
* **Design**: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week training study
* **Supplement**: Pre workout containing creatine monohydrate (3 g), betaine (2.5 g), caffeine (180 mg), and dendrobium extract
* **Placebo**: Calorie free flavored drink with similar amount of caffine

**Key findings:**

* Significant increase in subjective energy and focus reported by participants
* Small but statistically significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\~3–5 mm Hg)
* No significant improvements in muscle strength or lean body mass compared to placebo

**Bottom line:**

Felt like a vibe boost, not a power boost. You'll be wired and ready, but don’t expect your PRs to magically skyrocket just from this. Great for feeling like a gym superhero. Just maybe not lifting like one.

# 3. Cardiovascular Effects of Pre workout

Bella YF, Cupido SRS, Inacio PAQ, Sobral MLP, Vieira RP. Pre Workout Supplements and Their Effects on Cardiovascular Health: An Integrative Review. *J Cardiovasc Dev Dis*. 2025;12(4):112. Published 2025 Mar 24.

[**Read study**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40278171/)

**What they did:**

* **Scope**: Integrative review of 24 studies evaluating cardiovascular responses to MIPS
* **Participants**: Healthy adults and athletes
* **Supplements**: Various MIPS formulations, often with high caffeine doses (>200 mg)

**Key findings:**

* Mixed effects: some studies found reductions in blood pressure and LDL cholesterol
* Others found increases in resting heart rate and blood pressure, especially at high caffeine doses
* Individual responses varied widely depending on caffeine sensitivity and supplement composition

**Bottom line:**

Caffeine hits everyone different. If your pre makes your heart drum louder than your gym playlist, it’s not “working better”- it’s just overdosed for you. Know your limit. Respect your heart.

# The Bad: Pre workout side Effects & Overhyped Promises

But of course, with great power comes great... *crash potential.* Now that we’ve hyped up the good, let’s slide into the pre workout side effects that doesn’t get its own flashy marketing video. Because for every tub that gives you laser focus and Hulk strength, there’s one that leaves you itchy, dizzy, bloated, or wondering if your heart’s trying to break up with you mid set.

Some ingredients? Under dosed. Others? So over dosed they could probably power a small lawnmower.

# 1. Boosted Energy & Focus, but Side Effects Are Common

Jagim, A. R., Camic, C. L., & Harty, P. S. (2019). Common Habits, Adverse Events, and Opinions Regarding Pre Workout Supplement Use Among Regular Consumers. Nutrients, 11(4), 855.

[**Read Study**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6520716/)

**What they did:**

* Distributed an online survey via social media to adult males and females who reported regular use of multi ingredient pre workout supplements (MIPS). 1,045 responded, with **872 completing** the survey (males: 636;females: 233)

**Key findings:**

**Long term use was common:**

* 72.2% of users had been taking MIPS for over 1 year (630 out of 872 participants)
* MIPS were used frequently throughout the week
* The majority took them 4 or 5 days per week, with 24.1% using them 4 times and 24.3% using them 5 times weekly

The most common reasons for using MIPS (Multi Ingredient Pre Workout Supplements) included:

* Increased energy and mental focus by 89% of participants (776 users)
* Improved muscular endurance reported by 37.3% (325 users)
* Enhanced muscle pumps or better blood flow mentioned by 37.0% (322 users)

**Dosing patterns varied:**

* While most users took a single serving per workout
* 14% took two or more servings at once
* 18% used MIPS more than once per day

Adverse side effects were reported by over half (54%) of users, with common complaints including:

* Skin reactions (e.g. tingling or flushing)
* Heart related symptoms (e.g. palpitations or irregular heartbeat)
* Nausea or digestive discomfort
* Women were more likely to experience side effects, despite typically taking smaller doses than men

**Bottom Line**

Pre workouts are like a boost of energy and focus to get you going in the gym. But watch out lots of people, especially women, get side effects like jitters or upset stomachs. Don’t go overboard by taking extra scoops or stacking with other caffeine stuff. Play it safe and listen to your body.

# 2. Cardiovascular Safety Risks with Synephrine

de Jonge MLL, Kieviet LC, Sierts M, Egberink LB, van der Heyden MAG. Review of Case Reports on Adverse Events Related to Pre workout Supplements Containing Synephrine. *Cardiovasc Toxicol*. 2023;23(1):1-9.

[**Read Study**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36639595/)

**What they did:**

* Systematically reviewed case reports up to August 2021 from PubMed and Google Scholar, identifying 30 case reports involving 35 patients who experienced medical complaints after using p-synephrine containing supplements.

**Key findings:**

* **Symptoms:** The most frequent presentations included chest pain, palpitations, syncope, and dizziness.
* **Diagnoses:** Commonly ischemic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, and cerebrovascular events; 5 patients remained disabled or on long term medication at last follow up.
* **Confounders:** Many supplements combined synephrine with caffeine, making it difficult to isolate synephrine’s exact role.

**Bottom line:**

Synephrine sounds fancy, but it can mess with your heart pretty badly. If you have any heart problems or are sensitive to stimulants, don’t gamble with this ingredient; it’s like playing Russian roulette with your chest. Stick to safer fuels unless you want to risk more than just a shaky workout.

# So… Should You Use a Pre Workout?

Imagine mixing 300 mg of caffeine, tingles, beetroot powder, and vague promises of vascularity into a shaker and hoping it’ll fix your motivation crisis. That’s pre workout. Powerful? Sometimes. Necessary? Rarely. Safe? Depends on whether your scoop looks like a science experiment or a gamble. Let’s figure out when it’s actually worth it.

# You might benefit from a pre workout if:

* You’re dragging yourself into the gym sleep deprived, underfed, or emotionally bruised from your last squat attempt that folded you like a lawn chair.
* Your workouts are high volume or high intensity, and you actually need the help mentally, physically, or just to get through your absurdly long superset playlist.
* You’ve already dialed in the basics: sleep, hydration, nutrition, consistency. Pre is just the cherry on top, not the foundation.
* You know what you’re taking, why you’re taking it, and how much is in a scoop. No blind chugging mystery blends with names like “Thermonuclear Gutsplosion.”
* You’re not hypersensitive to caffeine, niacin, beta alanine, or, well, reality.

# You should probably avoid pre workouts if:

* You’ve had panic attacks, jittery episodes, or moments where your heart did the Macarena mid deadlift.
* You’re already drinking two to three cups of coffee a day and your adrenals are toast.
* You stack it with fat burners or energy drinks and wonder why your sleep feels like a deleted scene from Fight Club.
* You’re a beginner. Your gains will come from food, form, and consistency. Not from stimming your soul out of your body.
* You don’t know what’s in your pre because the label says “proprietary blend” and you just trusted the lightning bolts on the tub.

# My take?

Pre-workouts are tools. Not essentials. Not villains. Just tools.

Used right, they can help you push through a tough session with better focus, energy, and drive. Used wrong, they can fry your nervous system, kill your sleep, and leave you twitching in a cold shower wondering why your ears feel like static radio.

If you’re going to use them:

* Start with half a scoop and see how your body responds.
* Track more than just energy. Look at your appetite, mood, sleep, and recovery.
* Cycle off every few weeks. Your receptors need a break, and you don't want to rely on a chemical jumpstart just to do three sets of incline press.

Most importantly, don’t make pre workouts your emotional support supplement. If your session collapses without them, you’ve got bigger issues than caffeine tolerance.

# Smarter Alternatives

Not vibing with the idea of snorting 300 mg of caffeine and praying to the supplement gods you don’t ascend mid leg day? Good. You’ve got options smart, safer, and surprisingly effective alternatives that won’t make your skin crawl or your soul leave your body.

**1. Good Old Caffeine**

Sometimes the simplest fix is the best. 100–200 mg of plain caffeine in pre workout from coffee or caffeine pills hits the sweet spot for most people. No weird blends. No mystery dust. Just the same compound minus the dramatic marketing. Pair with a banana, and you’re good to go.

Bonus: Caffeine alone has been shown in multiple studies to enhance strength and power. It’s not inferior it’s just not branded as ""Rage Demon Vortex X9000.""

**2. Carbs Before You Barb**

One of the most overlooked pre workout hacks: eat some actual food. A small carb rich snack like fruit, oats, or rice cakescan fuel your workout better than any overpriced scoop of jittery powder. Glycogen is king when it comes to crushing reps.

**3. Hydration + Electrolytes**

You think you’re tired, but really you’re just dry. Dehydration kills performance. A pinch of sea salt in your water or an electrolyte tab pre gym can help sustain energy and pump without frying your nervous system.

**4. Breathwork & Mental Cues**

Sometimes all you need is the right headspace. Quick box breathing or a personal hype ritual can do more than a stim bomb. Remember Ronnie didn’t need 400 mg of caffeine. He needed a camera and the words “YEAHH BUDDY.”

**5. Build Your Own Pre Workout**

Don’t like the shady “proprietary blend” game? Make your own:

* **Caffeine**: 150–200 mg
* **Creatine monohydrate**: 3–5 g
* **Beta-alanine**: 2–3 g (if you’re into tingles)
* **Citrulline malate**: 6–8 g
* **Pink salt + water**: For pump and hydration

No surprises. No label lies. Just what works.

# Conclusion: Choose Wisely, Lift Wisely

Pre workouts can be the gym rat’s best wingman or a chaotic ex who shows up uninvited with heart palpitations and a tingling vendetta. Sure, the right formula can dial you in, slap some focus into your skull, and push you through brutal sets but the wrong one might have you pacing the locker room like you just chugged jet fuel.

""The science isn't dismissive pre workout supplements have legit benefits. More power, better endurance, maybe even an edge in muscle gain. But there are also pre workout side effects: underdosed pre workout ingredients, shady proprietary blends, and enough caffeine to start a small rave.

If your caffeine tolerance is sky high, your diet’s in check, and you’ve double checked the label like a paranoid chemist you’ll probably be fine. If not? You’re better off with a strong black coffee, a banana, and a playlist that makes you feel like a menace.

P.S. So yeah, I went down the pre workout rabbit hole. Not proud, not ashamed. Just very alert and slightly twitchy.

This is a repost which is a stripped down version. No PubMed links or overly clinical jargon. Just straight talk. If you’re into the full breakdown with references, side effects, and ingredient nerdery, I dumped it all here:

1l40zfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/cronometer/comments/1l40zfs/1_year_cronoversary_my_reflections/,1 Year Cronoversary: My Reflections,"Last week was my Cronoversary - 365th day of my streak. What a year it’s been

I downloaded Cronometer after an extremely caloric Memorial Day weekend 2024, tons of eating, no activity. This was fairly normal for me at the time. That said, when I looked at photos from the weekend I hated how I looked in nearly all of them. Maybe it wasn’t the angle of the photo or the camera, perhaps it was me.

I set my weight loss goal in the app (2lbs a week), got a Food Scale, and started. 

Over the past year I am down 37lbs, have defined abs, have (re)fallen in love with running, work out daily, and above all else am filled with positivity - this was not the case a year ago. Cronometer has been the foundation of this - this app has absolutely changed my life.

Below are reflections from the past year - both related to Cronometer, and a weight loss journey in general.

#1 - Journal! My absolute favorite feature of Cronometer is the “Snapshots” feature. Take a body photo the day you start Cronometer, and add it to snapshots with a blurb about how you’re feeling and where you want to go. Continue to update the snapshots frequently. After “locked-in” weeks, after travel, after a day when you stayed committed but it was absolutely so tough. You’ll look back on the snapshots fondly, or for inspiration, or even for a laugh

#2. Focus & changing focus. At the beginning of Cronometer, for at least my first 25lbs of weight loss, I solely cared about the energy summary - making sure I stayed within my “budget” to keep with the weight loss goal. This to say I almost never swiped over to view Macros or Micros. Looking back at the first four months of my Cronometer diary it’s almost funny to see my macro split, versus where it is today. Some days I would only get 50g of protein, now I try for over 180g of protein a day. All this to say, priorities change and what’s most important in the beginning, if your goal is weight loss, is a calorie deficit  

#3- Honesty. You want to grab another handful of chocolate chips and not log it, you can do that - though why would you do that? In the end you’re only cheating yourself

#4 Pre-log the day and stick to it. In my rough “dog days” of a calorie deficit, I found waking up and logging exactly how I wanted the day of eating to go helped give me added control, and made me want to stick with my plan. Some grams may change throughout the day, though I would work hard to not add anything to the day.

#5. Knowledge. 28grams is the serving size for nearly all snacks - I now have a much better eye/feel for 28grams, though it is still imperfect (which is why I use a food scale) . Prior to Cronometer I was likely consuming 70-90grams of chips and thinking my consumption was in line with the nutrition label. Same with butter, olive-oil, nuts, sauces, cheese - I thought these were things that you had to have, and were negligible in calorie consumption - now I know the truth

#6. Don’t drink your calories. My Starbucks  order went from something delicious (300cals), to iced americanos (15cal) Let the something delicious be a rare treat, versus a daily thing

#7. Eating at home of course makes tracking calories infinitely easier. That said over the past year I was traveling for 12+ weeks.  When traveling I tried to stick to fast casual national chains, like Chipotle and Sweetgreen, where the nutrition is all published online and already within Cronometer. This was not always feasible, especially during two weeks in Argentina. Continue to log while traveling, and do the best you can! Overestimate the sizes, add in olive oil, and workout even harder. It’s also fun to use Cronometer to go back to the days you were traveling and think back to all the delicious food you had

#8. Complete your day! That check box in the upper left corner. When you “conclude your eating journey” for the day - complete the day - for me it mentally moves my brain away from eating.

#9. Vegetables. Cucumber, Baby Carrots, Celery. If you’re feeling snacky - eat these! 

#10. “I’m Me.” Throughout my weight-loss journey I felt a lot of pushback from others. When declining to drink, saying no to a dessert, or being seen weighing my food, those around me (friends, family, colleagues) would be quick to ask why, and pass judgement. For a while I immediately went on the defensive, though I had a mindset shift. Now if I’m questioned on “why are you still weighing your food” or “you know you are allowed to put cream in your coffee” I respond with “Totally! I’m Me.” There is a Lil Wayne song, very explicit, called I’m Me where he raps “I’m Me, I’m Me, I’m Me, Baby I’m Me, So Who You, You’re not Me, You’re not Me.”  I really resonate with the sentiment here, be you - I’m Me. I’m going to continue to Cronometer, weigh my food, choose grilled chicken over pizza, workout, be positive, and live my life. I’m Me!!

“Success is rented, not owned, and rent is due every day.” 

Thanks for a great year, Cronometer!!!

But when I see that a roaster says they have won a Golden Bean award (see image below) - would you see that as a positive thing, that this roaster (heretofore unknown to you) is perhaps an above-average option?  In other words, if you were trying to decide between two equally unknown roasters with equally appealing-sounding coffees, and one had several of these and the other did not, would you see this as a meaningfully distinguishing characteristic?  Or no?

1l40xgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1l40xgu/choosing_to_believe_faith_faithlessness/,"Choosing to believe, faith & faithlessness","The best case for Mormonism I have ever encountered (and the but-for cause that kept me in the LDS Church for 20 years longer than I would have stayed otherwise) is a lecture that Terryl Givens gave at BYU called “[Lightning Out of Heaven](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/terryl-l-givens/joseph-smith-forging-community/).” It’s very good, and you should read it if you haven’t.

The climax of his lecture is a commentary on the nature of faith and the moral consequence of choosing whether to believe in something. He argues that the seeker of truth will encounter “appealing arguments for God as a childish projection, for modern prophets as scheming or deluded imposters, and for modern scriptures as so much fabulous fiction. But there is also compelling evidence that a glorious divinity presides over the cosmos, that God calls and anoints prophets, and that His word and will are made manifest through a sacred canon that is never definitively closed.”

And then he brings the juice:

>Why, then, is there more merit—given this perfect balance—in believing in the Christ (and His gospel and prophets) than believing in a false deity or in nothing at all? Perhaps because there is nothing in the universe—or in any possible universe—more perfectly good, absolutely beautiful, and worthy of adoration and emulation than this Christ. A gesture of belief in that direction, a will manifesting itself as a desire to acknowledge His virtues as the paramount qualities of a divided universe, is a response to the best in us, the best and noblest of which the human soul is capable. For we do indeed create gods after our own image—or potential image. And that is an activity endowed with incalculable moral significance.

And I think that’s right as far as it goes. At some level, there are compelling arguments for competing claims and ideologies: for both greed and generosity; for tribalism and cosmopolitanism; for exclusion and inclusion—and what we choose to believe in, how we choose to orient our morality, does say a lot about us. You might even say it’s the whole moral ballgame.

But that argument collapses when you apply it not just to ideologies but to falsifiable claims, particularly when there is no “perfect balance” to the arguments for and against the claims. Then you begin to impose a false equivalence as a way of justifying a belief in what you assume your faith compels. 

- - -

Yesterday I was rereading one of my favorite books, *That All Shall Be Saved*, which is an extended argument for Christian Universalism and an argument against what the author calls “Infernalism,” the belief that some people will be damned to unending torment. One defense of hell is that even though it may seem unjust to us mortals that anyone would suffer infinitely for finite sins, God is not a moral agent who chooses among various options—he is outside of morality, and, therefore, we are incapable of judging for ourselves whether the existence of hell is an act of infinite love or cruelty. We must accept, as a matter of faith, that it is good because God is goodness itself.

The author responds,

>To believe solely because one thinks faith demands it, in despite of all the counsels of reason, is actually a form of disbelief, of faithlessness. Submission to a morally unintelligible narrative of God’s dealings with his creatures would be a kind of epistemic nihilism… Submission of that kind could not be sincere, because it would make “true faith” and “bad faith”—devotion to truth and betrayal of truth—one and the same thing.

I find that argument so compelling and so self-evidently true that I can feel the heat of it burning through the brambles of all sorts of fundamentalism. It is not *faithful* to weave together bad-faith apologetics, to ignore the weight of reason and instead cobble together rationales why a fundamentally unreasonable claim might not possibly be entirely untrue. It’s an act of corrosive faithlessness to justify human iniquity by claiming it was all a command of God. 

I’d go so far as to say that this is at least part what Isaiah warns against when he condemns people who “call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!” It’s an act of taking the name of God in vain.

When I finally decided to exit the LDS Church, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and freedom—not in the contemplation that I could now drink coffee and eat out on Sundays, but in the realization that I no longer had to justify to myself and others doctrines that I did not believe. I had no idea how heavy that burden was until I cast it off. And I’d argue that doing so was a *faithful* act—at least more faithful than all the years I’d mumbled about how Brigham Young was “a man of his time” to myself and others.

**Why This Pick?**

With Robbie Ray (2.43 ERA) on the mound, the Giants come into this encounter with a huge advantage. Ray is an impressive 7-1 in his starts against Padres pitcher Dylan Cease (4.66 ERA) this afternoon who’s logged a mere 1-4. While San Diego has won 2 of the 3 games in this series so far, I think San Francisco bags a win with Ray on the mound today. I’m on the Giants to cash at home.

This morning I went to two different fast food drive thru spots to grab a coffee at one and a breakfast sandwich at the other. Both of the pretty young ladies working were smiling at me with prolonged eye contact and being extra nice.

Then I thought, maybe I genuinely got “the huzz” smiling and blushing at me with the luscious flow! I was wearing a nice watch and shirt too. Like the archetype of TikTok “old money” look or Christian Bale’s Bruce Wayne, and I can play it off now since flowy hair is a key aspect of it.

Some examples are, this woman would say racist stuff like .."" I was raised in a country that teaches you POC are dirty so I could never date someone outside my race now"" (she is asian), another time she asked me why black people call each other the N-word but said the entire word out loud at the office. I told her not to say that word regardless of context, to just say ""N-word"" and she said it again. I was horrified. She often drank on the job on summer Fridays which was not looked down upon because it was a small company but I do not drink and she would often try to get me to drink. Once she took us out for a work dinner and the waiter came to take our orders and she got a bottle of wine for the table but I told the waiter I don't drink you can take my glass to which.. she ignored me and told the waiter to pour me a little its fine. I was dumbfounded and grabbed the glass and place it in front of her and said , "" I don't drink"".

1l40rlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1l40rlo/the_life_we_live/,The life we live,"My first time writing I would like honest feedback on tje characters dialogue and story still

[It was early fall on campus, and a slight chill drifted through the courtyard. Leaves rustled at the feet of clustered students, their jackets pulled tight, their laughter light and fleeting like the wind. Among the crowd stood Alex, hands shoved in his hoodie pocket, nerves fluttering in his stomach. He scratched the back of his neck, his voice uncertain but sincere as he stepped a little closer to the girl standing nearby.

“Hey, um… Jean,” he began, his voice catching slightly. “How are you doing? Haven’t seen you since summer. Now it’s fall… and I guess I’m falling again.”

For a moment, there was silence. The small group quieted. Jean blinked, then let out a soft chuckle, her expression unreadable.

“Umm… yeah, Alex,” she said with a polite smile. “That was… a good joke.”

Before the moment could stretch too awkwardly, Paul’s voice cut in like a blade—loud, overly confident, his grin wide as he threw an arm around his girlfriend, Stacey.

“Oh boy, here we go again,” Paul called out. “The ol’ puppy eyes are back. Everyone, brace yourselves—Romeo’s here!”

Stacey laughed softly at first, brushing his arm. But then she gave him a light smack and muttered, “Stop it. Be nice.”

Paul shrugged, still smug. “I am nice. I just don’t care. I didn’t say anything wrong.”

“You know exactly what you did,” Stacey replied, folding her arms.

Alex stood quietly, his eyes lingering on them. It was always like this—Paul would poke fun, Stacey would giggle and scold him, but she never really pulled away. Alex couldn’t help but wonder: if she didn’t like how Paul acted, why did she still lean into him like that?

Jean turned to him again, gently changing the subject. “Anyway… it was a great summer. How was yours?”

Alex forced a grin. “Oh, it was wild. Fought monsters, investigated the paranormal, stopped Desmond from unleashing alien tech—saved the world.”

In his mind, it played out like a comic book. In reality, he’d spent the summer working behind the counter at a 7-Eleven.

Jean smiled kindly. “Well… at least you had fun.”

“I’ve gotta run,” she added. “Class is calling. Bye, guys.”

She walked off with that same graceful ease, and Alex waved. Then he turned toward Paul, frustration creeping into his voice.

“Come on, man. You’re my best friend. Why do you always gotta call me out in front of everyone?”

Paul laughed, already heading off. “Best friend? Please. You did this to yourself. Anyway, I’m not getting caught in your girl drama. I’m out.”

He walked away, leaving Alex standing alone in the courtyard. A sigh escaped Alex’s lips. He crouched down, picking up a small stone from the cracked pavement and rolled it between his fingers. The sky above was gray, thick with clouds.

“Fall sucks. College sucks,” he muttered to himself. “But hey… class is about to start.”

He tossed the stone aside and rushed off, late again.



It was a rainy Friday night at CJ’s Diner, one of the most popular spots for any college dorm crowd. Paul and Stacey were obviously together. Stacey was quiet and reserved, while Paul stayed quiet but observant, wearing a classic black and brown combo.
Stacey looked effortlessly graceful, wearing a typical white shirt and blue jeans.
They were the long-term couple — going strong for six years, high school sweethearts.
The school crowd was there, and so was Jean — tall, with long brown hair that curled softly over her shoulders. She smiled with grace and care. Everyone was having a swingin’ time.
Alex walked in.
“Sooo… Paul, thanks for the invite.”
Paul, exaggerating: “Who invites this guy again? Alright, I’ma head out.”
Stacey laughed, brushing his arm. “You’re funny. But stop — be nice.” Then she turned to Alex with a monotone voice, but a warmth behind it. “Hi, Alex.”
Then came Jeremy — long-haired, rugged.
“Paul, you’re such a jerk,” he said. “Leave him alone. Come on, Alex. Sit down.”
Alex tried, “Come on, Paul… you intend me, right?”
Paul replied, “Loser? No. But whatever, I’ma be nice today, I guess.”
As they all ordered food, Alex had a slice of pie with coffee. Jeremy had wings, listening to the soft jazz playing across the room. Paul and Stacey shared pancakes drizzled with syrup, while Paul munched on a ham and cheese sandwich. Alex looked around, enjoying the space and warmth in the air.
Boom.
Alex froze.
He saw her — Jean — walking in through the diner door, laughing with her friends. And just like that, something shifted inside him. His breath caught. It wasn’t just attraction; it was like gravity. A pull. As if the whole room dimmed and she was the only thing glowing.
Time slowed for a second.
Her hair flowed over her shoulders like soft waves, her smile easy and kind. She looked like she didn’t have to try to be beautiful — she just was.
“Guys… she’s here. She’s here,” Paul muttered, finishing his food.
But Alex wasn’t listening to Paul anymore. He was still staring at Jean.
Paul snorted. “Bruh, I feel bad for that girl. She gotta deal with you. Poor girl gonna suffer.”
Alex, timid — like a scared kid reaching for a flashlight: “Shut up, Paul. I’m just asking for an honest opinion.”
Paul shot back, “Yeah, and I’m giving you one, freak.”
Jeremy barked, “Wanker! You’re so rude to him. What did he do to you?”
Paul shrugged, “He was born. And annoying.”
He smirked, “Watch — he gonna go over there like a little boy, say hi, and be weird.”
Stacey, drawn into the conversation: “Why are you always like this, babe? What’s going on with you two?”
Paul shrugged, “Nothing. He started it.”
Alex sighed, “Ugh. Never mind. Sorry I asked.”
“Well guys,” he said, “I made money this week. I’ll pay for the appetizers and stuff.”
Paul lifted his coffee, warm and calm. “Thanks, buddy.”
Stacey smiled. “Yeah, thanks, Alex. Really sweet of you.”
Jeremy grinned, “You got money now, huh? Lol — thanks, man.”
Alex left quietly, picking up the crumpled twenty dollars he’d made doing a quick oil change.

“Ahhh bit you see but if I’m dead I will rise again like a phoenix 🐦‍🔥 “ “whoooooo yess sir “

I just thought of that you know glad you like it tho bit I’m ok I gotta go bye as walks way embarrassed rubs back my bad ladies I forgot to say but to the rest of you byeee and leaves again as he sits with the his friend group 

A weeks later. Alex is back with his friend group at the cafeteria. Usually it was the 3 of them Paul Stacey and Alex 

Alex: “Guys, I thought of a cool magic trick. I think Jean might like it. Wanna see?”
Paul sits with Stacey, her arms wrapped around his like a tree.
Paul: “No, man. I don’t want to see your dumb, easy magic trick.”
Stacey: smacking Paul lightly “Why do you have to be a jerk? Just let him.”
Then turning to Alex with a smile,
Stacey: “Yes, Alex, show us your magic trick.”
Alex stands and waves his hands with exaggerated flair.
Alex (with jazz hands): “Prepare to be amazed!”
Stacey picks a card, remembers it, and puts it back. Alex shuffles.
Alex: “Is this your card?”
Stacey: “Nope.”
Alex (mock shocked): “Oh no—wait!”
He fans out the cards face down, snaps his fingers, and flips one over — it’s the Queen of Hearts.
Stacey: surprised, laughing with sass “Okayyy! I don’t know how you did that, but that was cool. Good job, Alex.”
Paul: “I saw how you did it, pal. You and your voodoo.”
Alex (defensive): “It’s not voodoo, man.”
Paul: “Mmhmm. Witchcraft.”
Alex: sighing “Whatever.”
Alex: “I know you don’t know how I did it. So okay, Paul — show me then.”
Paul (sharply): “Nah, I don’t got time for that right now. Too busy with my girl, Stacey.”
Alex (grinning): “See? Told you.”
He walks across the cafeteria and spots Jean, wearing a brown sunflower dress, sitting with her friend Beth.
Alex: “Hey Jean, you look amazing. I got a magic trick I wanna show you. Wanna see?”
Jean pauses, then smiles — a soft, curious smile.
Jean: “Okay… show me.”
She leans in slightly, lifting her chin and paying attention.
Alex does the same trick.
Jean (smiling, laughing): “Wowww, magic boii! You’re really good — thanks for showing me.”
Beth: “That was cool, right?”
Alex (chuckling): “Yeah, no problem. Glad you liked it. Anyway… I gotta go. Bye, ladies.”
He walks off, smiling to himself.
Beth: “Sooo, what do you think of him?”
Jean (caught off guard): “I think… you’re trying to pry.”
She adds quickly, “He’s a nice guy. A good friend.”
There’s honesty in her voice, but also hesitation.
Beth (teasing): “Oh, is that all?”
Beth (again): “Watch — you two are gonna be something. Just wait.”
Jean: “Ugh, stooopppp. Not even.”
Silence falls. Jean glances across the room at Alex, a small smile tugging at the corner of her lips.
For a moment, the thought of her and Alex blooms in her mind… but she quickly goes back to eating.
Homeroom 1C — home to Janice, Beth, Paul, Jeremy, Stacey, and Alex — is hosting a Thanksgiving potluck. The teachers are letting students bring food to share.
Alex sits at his desk, daydreaming.
Alex (thinking):
A normal day at school… maybe I can actually talk to Jean today. Show her some magic. Just get to know her. That would be nice…
Ahhh, I’m excited. Maybe I’ll wear that brown suit. Hmmm… maybe she’ll notice how great I look in it. What should I bring?
Peruvian chicken. Yep. That’s it.

[Scene: Later that day, in the car — Alex is driving, Paul’s riding shotgun.]
Paul: “Hey, do me a favor. While you’re picking up your food for the potluck, I ordered some oranges — Clooney style — from Golden Place. Can you grab it for me? I gotta go find parking.”
Alex (jumping up): “Yes! Of course, buddy. No problem.”
Alex picks up both his Peruvian chicken and Paul’s order and places them in the back seat.
Paul (casual): “That was quick, huh?”
Alex (grinning): “It was the miracle of online ordering.”
Alex: “Yo, Paul — imagine being a DoorDash driver. You’re starving, and there’s food in the back. You just take a bite outta someone’s sandwich.”
Paul (laughs): “And when the customer complains, the driver’s like, ‘Naww bro, it came with bite marks.’”
Alex (laughing): “Exactly! I’d 100% eat someone’s fries if I was hungry.”
Paul: “Me too — especially if it’s Taco Bell. That stuff’s all mine.”
They both crack up, riffing off the ridiculous scenario.
Paul grabs his food and hops out with Alex.
Paul (giving him a once-over): “By the way, I like the brown. You look nice, buddy.”
Alex (smiling, with a playful tone): “Thanks, man. You look pretty sharp too.”

Two hours into the potluck. Laughter fills the classroom as students eat and talk.]
Paul and Stacey sit at a table, eating the chili they made for the class. They talk proudly about their dish while Jeremy sits across from them.
Jeremy (cool and mysterious): “I think it’s good. I can definitely feel the flavor. Not too much salt — perfect.”
Stacey (smiling): “He makes great chili. I’m glad you like it.”
She brushes Paul’s arm affectionately.
Paul (grinning): “Yeah, I like it. One of my best batches. Last time, I didn’t let it simmer long enough — but this time, I got it right.”
He blows a playful chef’s kiss to Stacey.
Just then, Alice walks over — close friends with Stacey.
Alice: “Mind if I pop in?”
Stacey (smiling): “Sure, of course, girl. You can.”
She gestures for Alice to sit next to her and begins introducing her to everyone.
Alex (recognizing her): “Hey — nice to see you again! I remember you… I’m Alex. Wait — duh, you know that.”
He smacks his forehead jokingly.
“Oh, by the way — I’m Paul’s cousin.”
Alice (surprised): “Wait — you’re Paul’s cousin? For real? I never knew that!”
Stacey (laughing): “What are you talking about? Alex is just making that up.”
Alex (grinning): “Yeah, guilty as charged.”
He leans his hands toward Alice like he’s pretending to be handcuffed.
Alice (playing along): “I’m not gonna arrest you today… but good one, Alex.”
Alex: “No — thank you for going along with me.”
Alice: “Yeah, well… you’re a great storyteller.”
They both smile. The group continues eating, chatting, and enjoying the warm atmosphere.
Alex stands, picks up his plate, washes his hands, and does a few magic tricks for other students — warming up before approaching Jean.
Alex (to himself):
“Okay, let me practice first… don’t mess this up.”
Meanwhile, across the room, Beth nudges Jean.
Beth: “Hmm. Why do you keep looking at Alex?”
Jean (deflecting, a bit flustered): “Nothing. I’m just looking around. It’s nothing.”

My boyfriend and I started seeing each other about 6 months ago and have officially become a couple 3-4 months ago. I’m the beginning he would plan dates and want to see me all the time. 

For the last few months however I see him very inconsistently. I’ve brought it to up him that I think we don’t see each other enough and he said he agreed but nothing really changed. He’s gone back to school for a second career so he is sometimes busy which I  completely understand and support him in.

But there are weeks when I see him 3 hrs a week. He sees his friends multiples times a week if not almost everyday cause they live close (I only live 10 minutes away though). Even when I do hang out with him it’s like he itching to get back to his plans. If he spend the night he wakes up and does even drink coffee and wants to head home…. If he’s going to grab dinner, he’s going out with his friends not me. We haven’t even been on a date night for 2 months. He promises me brunch or dinner but then just says he’s not hungry and we don’t go anywhere or do anything. 

How do I talk to him about this without coming off as a clingy person? He doesn’t call me clingy or anything but I feel like that when I ask him to hangout all the time and his response is often that he’s busy studying and then has plans with friends but he’ll see me in 5 days or so :/

We’ve been seeing each other for like 6 months and can count like 5-6 night we’ve spent together. 

He consistently tells me all these nice things and FaceTimes me ALMOST everyday but his actions keep falling short of his words. 

Edit: I’m going to answer some reoccurring questions here:

1. People are asking if his efforts in the bedroom are the same - yes when he’s with me he’s all with me. Sec is great but he’s definitely not just with me for sex it’s evident. We don’t have sex every time we hang out or even spend the night and he always makes sure to take care of me. 

2. People think he’s not invested - this one is a doozy to me cause when we are together he seems invested. He talks about the future as a surety and he takes out my garbage for me before leaving, if I cook he cleans up without being asked and generally is very service oriented. Which I love about him. 

I think part of the problem he doesn’t have his car currently cause another family was in need and has had care since I met him. He always has to uber to meet me and that’s too much work for him.  

And I think part of it is that his other long term relationship was a long distance one. So once a week was more than enough for them and it was yrs ago ",4,1749134064.0,dating_advice,28,0.75,False

He fans out the cards face down, snaps his fingers, and flips one over — it’s the Queen of Hearts.
Stacey: surprised, laughing with sass “Okayyy! I don’t know how you did that, but that was cool. Good job, Alex.”
Paul: “I saw how you did it, pal. You and your voodoo.”
Alex (defensive): “It’s not voodoo, man.”
Paul: “Mmhmm. Witchcraft.”
Alex: sighing “Whatever.”
Alex: “I know you don’t know how I did it. So okay, Paul — show me then.”
Paul (sharply): “Nah, I don’t got time for that right now. Too busy with my girl, Stacey.”
Alex (grinning): “See? Told you.”
He walks across the cafeteria and spots Jean, wearing a brown sunflower dress, sitting with her friend Beth.
Alex: “Hey Jean, you look amazing. I got a magic trick I wanna show you. Wanna see?”
Jean pauses, then smiles — a soft, curious smile.
Jean: “Okay… show me.”
She leans in slightly, lifting her chin and paying attention.
Alex does the same trick.
Jean (smiling, laughing): “Wowww, magic boii! You’re really good — thanks for showing me.”
Beth: “That was cool, right?”
Alex (chuckling): “Yeah, no problem. Glad you liked it. Anyway… I gotta go. Bye, ladies.”
He walks off, smiling to himself.
Beth: “Sooo, what do you think of him?”
Jean (caught off guard): “I think… you’re trying to pry.”
She adds quickly, “He’s a nice guy. A good friend.”
There’s honesty in her voice, but also hesitation.
Beth (teasing): “Oh, is that all?”
Beth (again): “Watch — you two are gonna be something. Just wait.”
Jean: “Ugh, stooopppp. Not even.”
Silence falls. Jean glances across the room at Alex, a small smile tugging at the corner of her lips.
For a moment, the thought of her and Alex blooms in her mind… but she quickly goes back to eating.
Homeroom 1C — home to Janice, Beth, Paul, Jeremy, Stacey, and Alex — is hosting a Thanksgiving potluck. The teachers are letting students bring food to share.
Alex sits at his desk, daydreaming.
Alex (thinking):
A normal day at school… maybe I can actually talk to Jean today. Show her some magic. Just get to know her. That would be nice…
Ahhh, I’m excited. Maybe I’ll wear that brown suit. Hmmm… maybe she’ll notice how great I look in it. What should I bring?
Peruvian chicken. Yep. That’s it.

[Scene: Later that day, in the car — Alex is driving, Paul’s riding shotgun.]
Paul: “Hey, do me a favor. While you’re picking up your food for the potluck, I ordered some oranges — Clooney style — from Golden Place. Can you grab it for me? I gotta go find parking.”
Alex (jumping up): “Yes! Of course, buddy. No problem.”
Alex picks up both his Peruvian chicken and Paul’s order and places them in the back seat.
Paul (casual): “That was quick, huh?”
Alex (grinning): “It was the miracle of online ordering.”
Alex: “Yo, Paul — imagine being a DoorDash driver. You’re starving, and there’s food in the back. You just take a bite outta someone’s sandwich.”
Paul (laughs): “And when the customer complains, the driver’s like, ‘Naww bro, it came with bite marks.’”
Alex (laughing): “Exactly! I’d 100% eat someone’s fries if I was hungry.”
Paul: “Me too — especially if it’s Taco Bell. That stuff’s all mine.”
They both crack up, riffing off the ridiculous scenario.
Paul grabs his food and hops out with Alex.
Paul (giving him a once-over): “By the way, I like the brown. You look nice, buddy.”
Alex (smiling, with a playful tone): “Thanks, man. You look pretty sharp too.”

Two hours into the potluck. Laughter fills the classroom as students eat and talk.]
Paul and Stacey sit at a table, eating the chili they made for the class. They talk proudly about their dish while Jeremy sits across from them.
Jeremy (cool and mysterious): “I think it’s good. I can definitely feel the flavor. Not too much salt — perfect.”
Stacey (smiling): “He makes great chili. I’m glad you like it.”
She brushes Paul’s arm affectionately.
Paul (grinning): “Yeah, I like it. One of my best batches. Last time, I didn’t let it simmer long enough — but this time, I got it right.”
He blows a playful chef’s kiss to Stacey.
Just then, Alice walks over — close friends with Stacey.
Alice: “Mind if I pop in?”
Stacey (smiling): “Sure, of course, girl. You can.”
She gestures for Alice to sit next to her and begins introducing her to everyone.
Alex (recognizing her): “Hey — nice to see you again! I remember you… I’m Alex. Wait — duh, you know that.”
He smacks his forehead jokingly.
“Oh, by the way — I’m Paul’s cousin.”
Alice (surprised): “Wait — you’re Paul’s cousin? For real? I never knew that!”
Stacey (laughing): “What are you talking about? Alex is just making that up.”
Alex (grinning): “Yeah, guilty as charged.”
He leans his hands toward Alice like he’s pretending to be handcuffed.
Alice (playing along): “I’m not gonna arrest you today… but good one, Alex.”
Alex: “No — thank you for going along with me.”
Alice: “Yeah, well… you’re a great storyteller.”
They both smile. The group continues eating, chatting, and enjoying the warm atmosphere.
Alex stands, picks up his plate, washes his hands, and does a few magic tricks for other students — warming up before approaching Jean.
Alex (to himself):
“Okay, let me practice first… don’t mess this up.”
Meanwhile, across the room, Beth nudges Jean.
Beth: “Hmm. Why do you keep looking at Alex?”
Jean (deflecting, a bit flustered): “Nothing. I’m just looking around. It’s nothing.”

*\*If you're located in Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington DC!*

**Hey! I wanted to invite you to Claim, the app that pays you to eat and shop in your city. It's even better with friends like you to go with! I had a feeling you might like $10 Cash-back at Starbucks so your Claim is waiting for you when you sign up. Use code 6NQNS5 or the link above :)**

If you want some extra info based on my experience:

In addition to the first $10 you get, there is a ""drop"" every Thursday at 10am CST where you can select a new cash back offer from a few different rotating coffee shops, restaurants, fitness studios, etc. So I have received the initial $10 to Starbucks, then $20 cash back from Tiffs Treats twice = $50 total.

How it works:

1. You link your card to the Claim app and your Venmo
2. Once you have made your purchase using the linked card at Starbucks, you'll select ""I've Redeemed my Claim"" in the app, and they will automatically verify a purchase was made and send you a Venmo! Their app says it can take 5 days to be reimbursed via Venmo, but I've always received it in the same day.

1l40nmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1l40nmr/china_paymentmobile_experience_as_a_canadian/,China payment/mobile experience as a Canadian,"I keep seeing questions come up and I just left China after traveling for 5 weeks all around the country and I thought I’d share my experience with the payment/mobile system as it was my biggest anxiety before going. So I hope this might help someone. 

Cash
- bring some. I have not found a place that didn’t take it. 
- I did encounter places (subways and buses) that did not take my Wechat/Alipay or was unsuccessful scanning it. So have some cash on you and try to keep smaller bills if possible.
- Having cash is the best insurance you can have to keep your trip smooth. 
- If you’re shopping, paying with cash for items over 200rmb with cash can save you from the 3% fee. 

WeChat/Alipay. 
- setup both. And make sure you complete the verification where you upload your picture and copy of passport. It may look like you’ve setup your credit cards already, but if you haven’t done the verification, it will not work when you are there. Do this at home before going cause it may take a few days to process. 
- I’ve had some places where one app didn’t worked but the other did for some unknown reason so make sure you have both handy. 
- if you don’t read Chinese, get familiar with the translation feature on both apps. They are a godsend. And the WeChat one is a bit clunky so you have to get used to it. 
- these apps are not only used for payments but also how you order food from restaurants. 
- for iPhone, you can setup shortcuts and add buttons to your Home Screen and control center to quickly scan or bring up your QR code for quick payment. This is for Alipay only. 

eSIM 
- I used Mobimatters as it was the cheapest one and it worked great. The eSIM is located in HK so all Google services were available. TikTok was not. 

SIM card
- China Mobile gives away free physical SIM cards. I stumbled upon this in Shenzen. I was going to buy a card but they told me foreigners are given 4 10GB cards to use. I pressed him on why and who pays for this but he didn’t really give me a response. But it works and I had a Chinese phone number for my trip. Just go into a bigger China Mobile store in a touristy area. Not one of those small shops. Look for younger staff as the older ones weren’t so helpful with me. 
- it does open up some things you wouldn’t be able to do without a number. Like I couldn’t order a Luckin Coffee without a phone number to register. And also using Dianping app, I was able to get some good deals on food and services but only with a phone number. So I recommend getting it. 
- I didn’t use the data on it too much since it is behind the China firewall. But I found that some things worked smoother on the China SIM card data. Like I was able to setup a transit card in a city with it on Alipay when my eSIM wasn’t working.  I was able to switch back and forth with my eSIM data relatively easily as well.  

VPN
- I used Surfshark and it worked most of the time. But it’s far from perfect. 
- I mainly used it while on WiFi. You have to reconnect to different locations all the time as some are faster than others at various times. My most successful locations were HK, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. 

Apps
- these are what I think are minimum must have apps while you’re there. 
- Alipay was my most used app. 
- WeChat 
- Trip.com
- Amap
- Dianping
- DiDi (you have this in Alipay anyway)
- Google Translate. 
- Surfshark VPN

Anyways I’m sure there is a lot of repeat info here from other posts. But I was always happy to read new ones going into my trip knowing others weren’t struggling there. It’s a beautiful place that is so different than Canada and the west in general when it comes to technology. You’ll get used to it but prepare to be frustrated in the beginning. Good luck and have a great time there. I sure did!

# How it works is you provide:

* A **JSON scene profile** (expression, setting, lighting, etc.)

And then ChatGPT outputs:

* A **vertical 9:16 split image**
* “Before” scene on top = struggle, doubt
* “After” scene below = subtle shift toward growth

All set in real Filipino life: tricycle garages, cafe corners, apartment desks, etc.

Recap: I've been burnt out since end April from work. I work as a grave digger and gardener at a cemetery . Boss not only keeps calling me, but wants me to come in weekly for coffee so I don't 'lose touch with collegues'. This is stonewalling my recovery process. Even the company doctor says I need to distance myself from work.

I went into work again because boss kept nagging that I come in for coffee. With a long sigh I agreed. I thought if I expressed how I needed to distance myself from work he would respect that so I'd finally be able to focus on recovery. This isn't what happened. We had an appointment at 9am. I requested specifically NOT to talk during break hours because I was in no mood to talk to colleagues and play 'Dr.Phil' with their questions. He made me wait 20min. I was already hearing footsteps heading towards the cafeteria so I knew it was almost break time. Luckily he pulled me in right before my colleagues saw me. He told me he has read the initial report from the company doctor. In the report it states 'He can do minimal tasks'. My boss told me that he expects me to come back into work next week Monday for 2 hours a day , and build my stamina from there. I knew this would happen . So I emailed the company doctor ahead of time to clarify what she meant by this in the report. She stated it means that I'm able to do my daily routine AT HOME (i.e. cooking, cleaning, etc) and NOT work related tasks. I showed my boss this email. I could tell he was visiably annoyed and sent me on my way as he angrily lit a cigarette. Here in my country the advice of the company doctor has priority. 

I thought I'd finally have the peace and quiet I need to recover now. But nope. Long behold after about a week and a half later my boss calls me up again. He says that my appointment with the company doctor has been moved FORWARD from the 19th June to the 11th. He stated that he did that because he feels 'i could use the help quickly' and that I should see this as something positive as he 'is concerned for me and wants to help'. I was completely speechless. If a company doctor is sick or can't make it FINE, change the date, but THIS? No way. Something fishy is going on. I know we are understaffed. I also know our department has the highest percentage of sick people out of everyone. That's why I strongly believe my boss is trying to speed up the process so I can get my butt back to work faster. Especially because summer vacation is around the corner and could use the extra hands. He simply doesn't care about my wishes and the fact of the matter is, my body decides when it wants to get better, NOT HIM . Speeding up the process won't get me back to work quicker. It's only irritating me more and stonewalling my recovery process further. I feel he doesn't respect me at all. To add insult to injury , my boss also had a burnout last year. He was able to take 6 months off. No one was breathing down his neck, he was allowed to take his sweet time. I ask for the same respect and consideration but nope, because I'm under him, I don't deserve it apparently. I'm just really upset !

Just as quickly began the first-world problems of supporting equipment.  Please bear with the background journey before I get to my point.

Started with a Breville boiler, which only had a small number of preset temps and using filtered water from my refrigerator dispenser.  Worked 'well enough' as I was starting out.

Went down the rabbit hole of coffee youtubers expounding how critical water is.  My Breville kicked the bucket, so switched to the Fellow Corvo.  Found the to-the-degree control did make a subtle but noticeable difference. So 'worked better'.

Realized I had super hard water in my area that the fridge or brita filters hardly put a dent in.  Went all in and got a (on sale) ZeroWater pitcher and Third Wave Water packets to make 'fully optimized coffee water'. Again, noticeable difference and worth it if going for subtlety of specialty / local roast coffee. If spending $20 on a bag of coffee, an extra 8 cents per cup for good water made sense.

... but now leads back to the first problem of the best way to boil water. I like  the precision control of water temperature but neither the Aeropress, nor my coffee habit, drives a need to be making a liter of water at a time.  I usually brew 240 ml (aka 240 grams, just over a cup) at a time, which is basically a full AP.  It will be hours before I make a second cup, if at all.

**Herein lies the rub / I get to my point**:  the Corvo and indeed all precision kettles I've considered so far have minimum fill requirements of 300 ml, and may need 400ml or even more in order for their precision temp control to function. Add in from my understanding it is not great to reboil water.  Before, heating up too much water was no issue - water was 'cheap' so I just emptied and refilled the kettle.  However, once you are using up ZeroWater filters and adding in Third Wave minerals... now water isn't as cheap and dumping out extra becomes wasteful.

So in this new convenient era of single cup brewers like the aeropress, why hasn't the precision kettle industry made any single cup (say 10 oz / 300g) max capacity, < 150 g min usable capacity, precision temperature control options?  Take up less counter space. 'Waste' less water.  A whole industry sprang up making aeropress accessories (e.g. Prismo), but not here for some reason.",0,1749133404.0,AeroPress,12,0.33,False

Worst of all - Cocoa Mint - Don't try it. Tooth paste flavour. You can't taste the coffee. Everything is just a no no about this. 

Second Worst -  Caramel - It's too artificial of a flavour. They just didn't know what they were doing. It's like you don't even know what you are drinking at this point. It doesn't taste like coffee at all. 

Third Worst - Vanilla - I don't think it tastes like Vanilla. I don't know. It tastes pretty weird, not coffee, not Vanilla. Lol. 

Second Best - it was called Blue berry I guess- It has a very unique . And it tastes very unique. I think was called blueberry muffin or something. I can't exactly remmber. But yeah, this is not exactly coffee flavoured. More like a sugary drink for morning/evening. 

The best imo - The Hazelnut - It stands out imo amongst all these because it has that distinct Hazelnut flavour. If you like Nutella, chances are you will like Nutella. 

There is a Pink one called Strawberry Cheesecake - and yes, you guessed it right it is very sweet / artificially  flavoured. You might not want it. 

Note - I have my coffee with sugar and milk, that's how I have it. Country bean and otherwise, but some of the coffee by this brand just scream artificial flavour and fragrance too. I guess if you have a sensitive nose you might have a headache. 

Considering, the Hazelnut one, I had tried some other brand, as well as Tata's and Bru's Hazelnut. They were not worth it at all. 

Closing remark - I'd consider Berry and Hazelnut (if you get BOGO) Or just Hazelnut. Again, this doesn't taste like coffee, even if you drink Nescafe or Bru this won't be comparable. 

They have a hot chocolate which is pretty good for the quantity and quality. I'd say that was my favourite product by them.

1l40f4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVpnEng/comments/1l40f4e/best_vpns_for_snapchat/,Best VPNs for Snapchat,"ready to check your Snapchat streaks, only to discover that your school's WiFi has blocked the app. Frustrating, right? Or maybe you're traveling abroad and suddenly can't access Snapchat in certain countries. Whether you're dealing with restrictive networks or privacy concerns, a **VPN for Snapchat** might just be your new best friend.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the **best VPNs for Snapchat** in 2025, helping you stay connected with friends while keeping your digital life secure and private.

# Why You Need a VPN for Snapchat

Before diving into our top picks, let's talk about why you might need a VPN for Snapchat in the first place. Trust me, the reasons are more compelling than you might think.

# Privacy and Security Benefits

Snapchat knows a lot about you – probably more than you realize. From your location data to your browsing habits, the app collects various information that could potentially be misused. When you use Snapchat on public WiFi networks (like at coffee shops or airports), you're essentially broadcasting your activity to anyone who knows how to look.

A quality VPN encrypts your internet connection, making it virtually impossible for hackers, advertisers, or even your internet service provider to spy on your Snapchat activity. Think of it as a protective tunnel around your data – nobody can see what you're doing inside.

# Bypassing Restrictions at School and Work

Here's where things get real for most users. Schools and workplaces frequently block social media platforms like Snapchat to minimize distractions and preserve bandwidth. While their intentions might be understandable, sometimes you just need to check in with friends or maintain those important Snapstreaks.

A VPN helps you bypass these restrictions by routing your traffic through external servers, making it appear as though you're browsing from a different location entirely. The network firewall can't identify that you're using Snapchat, so it lets the traffic through.

# Accessing Snapchat in Restricted Countries

Some countries take digital restrictions seriously. **Snapchat is currently blocked in China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Cuba.** If you're traveling to these regions or living there temporarily, a VPN is often your only option for staying connected with friends back home.

Additionally, some countries have intermittent blocks on social media during times of political unrest or sensitive events, making a reliable VPN essential for consistent access.

# Top 5 Best VPNs for Snapchat in 2025

After extensive testing and research, here are our top recommendations for the **best VPNs for Snapchat**. Each offers unique advantages depending on your specific needs and budget.

# How to Use a VPN with Snapchat

Setting up a VPN for Snapchat is surprisingly straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide that works for any of our recommended services:

**Step 1:** Choose and subscribe to a VPN service Select one of our recommended VPNs and sign up for an account. Most offer significant discounts for longer-term commitments.

**Step 2:** Download the VPN app Install the VPN app on your device (phone, tablet, or computer). All our recommended services offer dedicated apps for iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac.

**Step 3:** Connect to a server Open the VPN app and connect to a server in a location where Snapchat is accessible. If you're trying to bypass school restrictions, choose a server in your country for the best speeds.

**Step 4:** Launch Snapchat Once connected, open Snapchat as usual. The app should work normally, but now your connection is encrypted and your location is masked.

**Pro tip:** If you're still having issues, try connecting to a different server location or contact your VPN's customer support for assistance.

# Free vs Paid VPNs for Snapchat

While the temptation to use a free VPN is understandable, especially for students on tight budgets, there are important considerations to keep in mind.

**Free VPN Limitations:**

* **Speed restrictions:** Often limited to 1-2 Mbps, making video sharing painfully slow
* **Data caps:** Many limit you to 500MB-10GB per month
* **Server limitations:** Fewer server options mean higher chance of blocks
* **Privacy concerns:** Some free VPNs sell user data to advertisers
* **Reliability issues:** Frequent disconnections and downtime

**Best Free Options:** If you must use a free VPN, consider **PrivadoVPN's free tier** (10GB monthly) or **Windscribe** (10GB monthly). However, these limitations make them impractical for regular Snapchat use.

**Why Paid VPNs Are Worth It:**

* Unlimited data and bandwidth
* Faster, more reliable connections
* Better customer support
* Stronger privacy protections
* Money-back guarantees let you try risk-free

Most paid VPNs cost less than a monthly coffee habit but provide significantly better performance and security.

# Common Issues and Troubleshooting

Even with the best VPNs, you might occasionally encounter issues. Here's how to solve the most common problems:

**Snapchat Still Blocked:**

* Try connecting to a different server location
* Switch VPN protocols (try OpenVPN if using WireGuard)
* Clear Snapchat's cache and restart the app
* Ensure your VPN's kill switch isn't interfering

**Slow Loading Times:**

* Connect to a server closer to your physical location
* Try a different server in the same country
* Check if your VPN offers optimized servers for streaming
* Temporarily disable unnecessary VPN features

**App Crashing or Connection Issues:**

* Update both your VPN app and Snapchat to the latest versions
* Restart your device
* Try disabling other VPN apps if you have multiple installed
* Contact your VPN's customer support

**Location Services Not Working:** Remember that VPNs change your IP address but don't affect GPS location services. If you want to change your location on Snapchat's Snap Map, you'll need to disable location services entirely, though this will limit some app features.

# Legal and Safety Considerations

Using a VPN with Snapchat is legal in most countries, but there are some important points to consider:

**Terms of Service:** While Snapchat doesn't explicitly prohibit VPN usage, always ensure you're complying with their terms of service. Avoid using VPNs for activities that violate Snapchat's community guidelines.

**School and Work Policies:** Check your institution's IT policies before using a VPN on their networks. While VPN use is generally legal, some organizations have specific rules against circumventing network restrictions.

**Country-Specific Laws:** In countries where Snapchat is blocked, VPN usage might also be restricted or illegal. Research local laws before attempting to bypass government-imposed blocks.

**Privacy Best Practices:**

* Always choose VPNs with verified no-logs policies
* Use strong, unique passwords for your VPN account
* Enable two-factor authentication when available
* Regularly update your VPN app for security patches

# Which VPN Should You Choose?

Choosing the right VPN depends on your specific needs and circumstances:

**For Students:** **NordVPN** offers the best balance of affordability, performance, and reliability for bypassing school restrictions.

**For Speed Enthusiasts:** **ExpressVPN** delivers consistently fast connections perfect for sharing high-quality content.

**For Budget-Conscious Users:** **Surfshark** provides premium features at an affordable price with unlimited device connections.

**For Beginners:** **CyberGhost's** user-friendly interface and longest money-back guarantee make it ideal for VPN newcomers.

**For Privacy Advocates:** **Private Internet Access** offers the strongest privacy features and largest server network.

The good news? All of our recommended VPNs offer money-back guarantees, so you can test them risk-free to see which works best for your specific situation.

# Final Thoughts

Whether you're trying to maintain your Snapstreaks at school, access the app while traveling, or simply want to protect your privacy while sharing moments with friends, a reliable VPN is an invaluable tool. The key is choosing a service that balances performance, security, and affordability based on your specific needs.

Remember that the digital landscape is constantly evolving, and what works today might need adjustment tomorrow. That's why it's worth investing in a reputable VPN service with responsive customer support and regular updates.

Don't let network restrictions or privacy concerns keep you from staying connected with the people who matter most. With the right VPN, you can snap, share, and stay secure no matter where you are in the world.

1l40e87,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mundane-Arm-900/comments/1l40e87/am_i_so_wrong_living_with_others/,Am I so wrong? Living with others,"I was living with an elderly couple while I was job hunting. They were incredibly kind — they didn’t charge me rent and even made dinner for me. I was (and still am) deeply grateful for their generosity, and I did my best to show appreciation by helping around the house — doing chores, running errands, and trying to support them however I could.

But there’s something that’s still bothering me, and I want to share it because I need to understand if I’m being ungrateful or if my feelings are valid.

On the very first day I arrived, the older woman showed me the room, but she seemed very angry and serious. She firmly told me that it was *her* house and that I needed to strictly follow *her* rules. She repeated this several times, almost like she was scolding me before I even did anything wrong. I was shocked. Of course, I understood that I needed to respect her space — I would never assume otherwise — but the way she said it, with such a stern expression and repeated warnings, made me feel extremely pressured and uncomfortable right from the start.

Thankfully, her husband was very kind and calm. He made me feel safer in the house, and I appreciated his presence a lot. I continued doing my best to return their kindness — cleaning, helping, and buying things they needed.

Then, one day, I accidentally damaged something. I was trying to help by closing the curtain, but the drill came loose. I got very anxious and completely forgot to tell them about it right away. Later that day, they noticed and asked me, and I immediately admitted what happened, apologized sincerely, and promised to be more careful. They told me it was okay and just to be cautious in the future. I felt incredibly relieved and thankful that they didn’t get upset.

But the next day, everything changed. The woman scolded me harshly. She claimed I never apologized (even though I had) and accused me of only admitting it because I was caught. I reassured her that I was truly sorry and that I never meant to cause harm. But then, during breakfast, I made another mistake — I forgot to switch the water filter setting back from “ice” to “filtered water,” and when she tried to get water, it came out with ice. She immediately shouted at me. She said she had already told me to change the setting back after using it, and I sincerely apologized again.

But in my heart, I was feeling so sad and anxious. I hadn’t meant to damage the curtain — I was just trying to help, and it was an accident. I forgot to change the water setting because I was under a lot of stress from how tense things had become with her. But even though I felt misunderstood, I still apologized.

Her husband came downstairs and asked what had happened, and she told him about the water setting. He calmly said it wasn’t a big deal. But instead of calming down, she got even angrier — shouting again, saying I was ruining their property, even saying things that made me feel like she hated me or wanted to harm me. I was genuinely terrified.and I realized she is not a forgiving person. No matter how small the mistake, she seemed to hold onto it tightly. Even when she offered me something — like food or help — and I politely declined, she would remind me to say ""thank you,"" as if gratitude wasn’t something I already deeply felt, but something I constantly needed to prove to her.

Whenever I made even small mistakes — like bringing coffee into the bedroom, not coming home before the dinner time she set, or talking to her husband more than to her — she would come after me, scolding me again and again until she seemed satisfied, as if my discomfort was necessary for her to feel in control. I felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells, waiting for the next thing she’d use against me. It didn’t matter how well I behaved or how much I tried to help — nothing seemed to be enough.

But honestly I don't know. I feel so upset. Would you say I am being ungrateful ? ",1,1749133195.0,u_Mundane-Arm-900,0,1.0,False
1l40e6u,https://i.redd.it/8hk5o4h0b45f1.jpeg,The Curious Case Of Country Bean Coffee (Rant/Review/Vent),"So I have tried these coffees over a few months. And here's my final verdict. I got them on a BOGO. But still it was expensive, for an instant coffee. 

Worst of all - Cocoa Mint - Don't try it. Tooth paste flavour. You can't taste the coffee. Everything is just a no no about this. 

Second Worst -  Caramel - It's too artificial of a flavour. They just didn't know what they were doing. It's like you don't even know what you are drinking at this point. It doesn't taste like coffee at all. 

Third Worst - Vanilla - I don't think it tastes like Vanilla. I don't know. It tastes pretty weird, not coffee, not Vanilla. Lol. 

Second Best - it was called Blue berry I guess- It has a very unique . And it tastes very unique. I think was called blueberry muffin or something. I can't exactly remmber. But yeah, this is not exactly coffee flavoured. More like a sugary drink for morning/evening. 

The best imo - The Hazelnut - It stands out imo amongst all these because it has that distinct Hazelnut flavour. If you like Nutella, chances are you will like Nutella. 

There is a Pink one called Strawberry Cheesecake - and yes, you guessed it right it is very sweet / artificially  flavoured. You might not want it. 

Note - I have my coffee with sugar and milk, that's how I have it. Country bean and otherwise, but some of the coffee by this brand just scream artificial flavour and fragrance too. I guess if you have a sensitive nose you might have a headache. 

Considering, the Hazelnut one, I had tried some other brand, as well as Tata's and Bru's Hazelnut. They were not worth it at all. 

Closing remark - I'd consider Berry and Hazelnut (if you get BOGO) Or just Hazelnut. Again, this doesn't taste like coffee, even if you drink Nescafe or Bru this won't be comparable. 

They have a hot chocolate which is pretty good for the quantity and quality. I'd say that was my favourite product by them.

I was diagnosed w hashimotos about 2.5 years ago and it’s been a rollercoaster. Of course at first I saw endocrinologists and my family doctor who would just say “take levothyroxine, your numbers look fine you’re fine” and i felt hopeless. About a year after my diagnosis I decided to see a functional/holistic medicine doctor, and it seriously changed my life. He had me on all kinds of natural supplements and detoxes to clear the inflammation from my body, and heal my gut, and I saw a big change. He had me cut out gluten, dairy, soy, pretty much all inflammatory foods. Apparently my labs were very very bad (and that’s not just looking at thyroid levels, that’s blood cell counts, all vitamins, cortisol, inflammation markers, etc). His program that I was in has come to an end, thus has the extensive supplements. I do feel better, however one thing that has not ever changed is my brain fog. My energy levels obviously fluctuate, but I’ll have a really good couple weeks, and then a really really bad whole month. It’s something even he can’t seem to explain or help me with. I feel like I’m inside a bubble, and the best way I explain to people is that I feel like I’m not here, like I’m dreaming and none of this is real, but like CONSTANTLY. it never goes away. Not once in 2 years. Don’t even get me started on my short term memory. 
I’m almost desperate for something to help, if I was able to find things to help all my symptoms there’s gotta be something to help this. I’m generally stress free, I sleep pretty well, I exercise a few times a week, I still don’t eat dairy or gluten and avoid soy. I also don’t drink alcohol or caffeine, I just feel like there’s something I’m missing and not even my holy grail holistic doctor can help anymore. All of my labs are damn near perfect, in the eyes of my normal doc and my holistic doc. 
Here are the supplements/meds I currently take; 
-obviously Levothyroxine 25mcg 
-selenium 200mcg with 117 mg calcium
-vitamin B complex 
-omega 3s about 700mg 
-magnesium glycinate 100mg at lunch
-and something called acetyl-ch from my holistic doctor, it has pantothenic acid, acetyl l-carnitine, 
And alpha GPC, Its sole purpose is to help neurons in the brain fire properly and healthily, thus reducing brain fog, (it doesn’t). 

And of course no gluten, dairy, alcohol or caffeine in quite some time. Simply because they’re inflammatory. Some things waiver (I’ll have a little soda or milk chocolate every one in awhile, but no coffee and I’m not going in on cheese or milk lol) 

I know we aren’t doctors, and all of our bodies handle hashimotos in different ways. I guess I’m looking for advice? If you also struggled with horrible brain fog but have found something that helps im all ears. Maybe I need to change my supplements? Im also taking less than the doctors recommended because i tend to be scared it’ll make me feel bad. 

My once piece of advice for anyone new or still really having a hard time, see a functional medicine doctor. Not only did it really help but I’ve learned so much about my body, how everything works and why we do what we do. Not typically covered by insurance bc it’s “experimental” but worth every penny in my eyes.
