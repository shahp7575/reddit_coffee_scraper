TL;DR I'm a graveyard worker, and a coworker im attracted to is going back to days, and im considering pursuing something but not interested in dating 

--

i (22/nb) work doing a graveyard stocking shift at a grocery store, hired in the summer of 2024. the graveyard crew roster is fairly small (about 5 other people consistently, and then sometimes a few rotate in for periods of time). most of the other crew are significantly older than me (30-50) and all men (except for one recent hire). about three months ago one of the day shift guys, D (mid 30s/M) came over to nights, and had done them for years previously (been with company about 20yrs)

I get along with the whole crew pretty well, senses of humor line up and we all jome around and have good banter. it was the same with D when he came on shift, and when I was first hired before I got moved to graveyards he was always nice in passing (worked different departments). it felt like whenever he'd pass me during the day working, he'd make a point of telling I was doing a good job. didn't think much on it, because my second week I ended up being alone/in charge of the dairy department and got overwhelmed one day (had 3 orders come in that I needed to unload/warehouse, stock and receive the invoice for while also keeping the rest of the department stocked. it was my 5th shift.) and had a panic attack, and there had been a few people who seemed to make sure to tell I was doing a good job for a bit after that. I assumed word had gotten around and they were all trying to reassure me. 

after D came on graveyard (10pm - 630am shift), it quickly became a habit that when we clocked in at midnight, he'd go to the break room to make a coffee and then would bring me out a drink as well. we also have good banter on shift, but ive noticed we tend to joke around a bit more than I do with the other guys (he's friends with the main crew from when he used to do graveyard before), and still makes a point of telling me I did a good job on shift.

i do, admittedly, find him attractive (I know, don't shit where you eat), but kind of wrote it off. however over the past month/month and a half, it feels like things have gotten a bit more flirty banter wise between us. I've given him a few rides home after work since he walks (~30m walk, ~5m drive) when the weather is bad. it's an offer I've extended to another coworker who walks as well, but they have only turned me down on it to date. D has just returned to dayshifts now though, since his sleep schedule wasn't adjusting well to graveyards. 

anyway, all that exposition to basically lead to this: 
• how bad of an idea is it really to think about involvement with him? i wouldn't want to date, and unfortunately small town + being mostly introverted + not being a drinker doesn't lead to a lot of opportunities for me to meet people to get 'friendly' with. we'll no longer be having any shifts together (he's going to produce in the day, im still in grocery overnight), but still working within the same company and he's friends with the coworkers I do still work with
• how would I test the waters to make sure my brain isn't just making things up, and that he may actually be flirting with me? that it isn't just him being friendly/nice? (he made a point of complimenting me almost every shift, whether work performance or more personally. would specifically make and bring me a drink when we worked together, never did this or offered to for anyone else on shift. would start conversations with me if we ended up stocking in the same aisle (happens with coworkers, but not a consistent-everytime thing like with him). if he was in a different department during the night, would come over and talk with me for a bit at least once. would let me know when he + other coworker were going on coffee and say that I should join them (not especially standard for us as a crew). I haven't really been approached since highschool, and highschool boys were also... very direct. 
• if I think that he may also be interested in hooking up, how would I get the ball rolling on that/initiate it/make it clear that I would be interested/am attracted? I'm worried that if he IS, he's probably waiting on me to do something first so I wouldn't feel any pressure to say yes (man. older. senior employee but not higher position, just with the company for years). 

I would prefer replies that aren't just 'dont do it'/'dont shit where you eat'/ect. ",0,1742147492.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

WOFF WOFF



STUNK



CLANG



What? Where? I wake up from a series of loud noises, in a room I don’t really recognize…My brain struggles to start functioning…



*ok first where am I?* 



Right, my first day of Uni was yesterday, and I am in my new house, in the bed I crashed into last night.



*Next, What the fuck is all this noise?*



I rise slowly out of bed, and I cautiously walk downstairs still in my nightgown and there I find Agape surrounded by shreds of plates and cups. On the other side of the room I find my setter Argo, that stops sniffing what looks like a fainted Venlil, to run toward me demanding pets.



“*Good boy*, what have you done? still trying to herd Venlil? you arrived while I was sleeping haven’t you?”, he brushes against my legs happily while I stroke his chin. “Now let’s fix this little mess you made, shall we?”, I head toward Agape and help raise it up, I interrupt its confused explanations and apologies and say: 

“don’t worry it's actually kinda funny…now help the fainted Ven and collect what it went to deliver. Then bring me a coffee upstairs in a couple of minutes, ok?”. And to Argo with a sweet voice: “Now let’s go upstairs fluffball ok?”. 



In my room I quickly prepare myself for the day. I put on a black dress with a leather belt in the middle and black leather shoes to match and I collect my hair with a clasp decorated with a blue Krakatol plume leaving only a curl out. Done that I open the door to the balcony and sit on a chair familiarising myself with my surroundings. I am in a small two floor house with a tiny garden and below me there is a road with on the other side a tiny river slowly flowing. I close my eyes momentarily to enjoy the sun on my face and Argo’s warmth on my feet. After that I gulp down the coffee that Agape had silently brought while I was distracted and head for the stairs. I open the door, warn Agape that I am living and to let the dog back in, and head down toward the cafè where Ingrid and I decided to meet.

I walk fast down the road, it’s weird but I can’t shake the feeling that I am being watched.



*Get a grip Vic! All your life you craved a bit of solitude and then you get creeped out by a walk? You know that you are probably always on light surveillance for security reasons.*



I shake my head and straighten my shoulders and yet the feeling it’s still there.



After a couple of minutes I reach the cafè where Ingrid it’s already waiting along the Jaslip from Mr Varths’s class and an Arxur I don’t recognize. Since they have already been served I signal to a waitress to bring me a cappuccino and a croissant.



“Hi, am Victoria a classmate of Ursula and you as well I think?” I say looking at the Jaslip. 

“I am Alkimos, and you are correct we are in that same class, but more in general I am here to study ecological engineering. and you? what do you study?”

“Political science and administration”, 

“aiming for a seat in the senate aren’t you? I am Aspis by the way” says the Arxur in a cheeky way,

“One day maybe ain’t that easy after all” I say slightly sheepishly.

“With that family pedigree? nah”

“I guess my attempt to be stealthy failed miserably, didn’t it?”

They all nod and Ursula adds “You are kind of a public figure after all”. 

“Well, since you all know who am I. What can you guys tell me about you?”

“Well \[begins Ursula\], I am here to study aerospace engineering and with time I hope to specialize in autonomous drones, a field that it’s still relatively green. Also, my parents are Norwegian and Swedish but I grew up in Iceland. My parents received a farm there when they left the service”

“Wow, do you speak Icelandic?”

“Learned a bit in school, but to be honest most don’t nowadays. It had a few speakers already before The Fall and now with all the new people moving in..”

“Same with Maltese, there are so few speakers left that my mother and I may count as a percentage…” I turn toward the Jaslip and ask. “And you? aiming to restore Esquo environment?”

“In the long run, yes. But, in the short term I would also like to help fix yours. It took quite a beating in this century. Between climate change and the extermination fleet…”

“It helped that they kinda compensated each other in a way” says Ursula pensive, and then adds: “You're looking for citizenship through service aren’t you? that’s why you are in officer training”

“Well, I don’t have less reasons to hate the federation than any of you. If anything mine are fresher. Besides I want to petition for family reunion, things are getting difficult in refugee camps on other Consortium planets” he says slightly offended.

“We are all sorry for your losses” I say in a sad tone and we all nod and then, in an attempt to change argument I disable my implant and I say in Arxur: “And you fat hatchling what are you doing here?”

“I am here to study archeology, I got fascinated with the mosaics and documents from the Kedros civilization that you clever monkeys have dug up from our southern desert” he answer in the same jest.

“Well you egg munchers have had it good since meeting us, don’t you?” sending a cheeky look at its almost empty plate of scrambled eggs. It’s about to answer me when he sees Ursula's shocked look and it clicks: “Wait…I don’t ear the translator, are you speaking Arxur?!”

“Yeah. I grew up surrounded by Arxur, including one that I consider my quasi older brother, it’s in fact one of my native languages along with maltese and portuguese” and the looking at two: “Aren’t you supposed to learn english or arxur in school anyways?”

“Yeah but it’s passive learning in case the translators don’t work and a bit of literature…how do you do with the sounds we can’t reproduce?” says Ursula.

“I approximate them”

“It sounds like an odd accent or a lisp” growls Aspis with admiration. 

At that point Alkimos interjects: “I hate to break this nice moment but I need to go or I am going to be late to class”, Aspis looks at his pad and raises as well. I look at Ursula and say: “I still have about a half hour, fancy a walk?”

“Why not? I have an interview in an hour so as long we go in right direction…heck it could help with my anxiety a bit”

“I am sure you’ll do great. Where are you going to work?”

“The federnet research agency I hope”.

While we raise and prepare to walk away, I have again that sensation of being watched and it sends a shiver down my spine.

While I am hiding in a bush, I look again to the predator cub, the reason for which I lost my Lalin, my everything. At that moment I wish to have an exterminator flamethrower so I can cleanse the universe from that filth. But right now I can’t so I try to distract myself thinking  about the meeting tomorrow night and my lingering sensation that it might be a trap.

I’m currently researching my first espresso machine and want to invest in something that will last for many years. My wife and I drink 1–2 coffees per day, switching between Americanos, cappuccinos, and espressos. We’re planning to use this machine until it breaks, so it’s a long-term purchase. Additionally, we’d like to be able to make coffee for guests when needed.

One of my main concerns is workflow when making multiple drinks. Specifically, how long does it take to make **four cappuccinos** with each of these machines? I’d love insights on:

1. **Total time from a cold start** (including warm-up time).

2. **Total time when the machine is already heated up** (just the time to pull the shots and steam the milk).

The reason I’m asking is that I’d like to enjoy a cappuccino with friends **without the first cup going cold** before the last one is ready. For larger groups, I have a Moccamaster for filter coffee, but for smaller gatherings, I’d like to ensure a smooth cappuccino-making process.

The machines I’m considering:

• **Profitec Go**

• **Rancilio Silvia Pro X**

• **Profitec Move**

If anyone has experience with these machines and can share timing estimates (or general workflow advice), I’d really appreciate it!

Any ideas?,"My Sage recently developed issue with inconsistent pull. When sometimes it stops the pull just after 2s, other times it stops after 5s and sometimes it completes the usual time it takes to pull full double shot extraction.  
  
And I am not sure how to fix this. The machine is still able to generate pressure but is inconsistent (one time it does, other times it doesn't due to lack of time in pull, it seems very random (and it works perfectly fine in cleaning mode, where the pressure holds consistently) - almost as if there was a sensor measuring the time it's dispensing water/pressure telling the machine when to cut off the pull - and that part has gone faulty and started throwing random results? I added video below.)  
  
**Usage**: at home for almost 10 years now (approx. 3 coffees a day)  
**Model**: the Barista Express (non-digital)  
**Cleaning**: When required I use cleaning tablets regularly. I have also done descaling yesterday, which didn't help at all  
  
I would really appreciate anyone who had similar issue / or would know which part is the problem / some video covering this issue / or part that would need to be ordered and exchanged. That would be amazingly helpful

I don't struggle as much with executive dysfunction, I mainly need help with focusing/concentrating on my, very intense, studies. 

I got diagnosed relatively recently, the first medication i tried was Ritalin LA 30mg and it didn't do anything for me. Then my neurologist put me on Dexamphetamines. First day I took a dose of 10mg after having a protein rich breakfast, and at first it seemed to have helped. I felt a slight boost in concentration when I was studying and was less distracted by my phone, had energy despite sleeping like crap the previous night, and when I drank coffee that evening i even had a hard time going to sleep and needed to take melatonin. So i thought i found the right meds for me and my doctor prescribed me enough for several months until I come back to my hometown (I'm an international student).

 Unfortunately that was the only day i felt the dexamphetamines actually help and I'm starting to wonder if it was the placebo affect instead, because every other time I've taken the medication, even under the right conditions (protein breakfast, no hormonal fluctuations, no citrus), I felt nothing. 
I still need to be careful with caffeine when taking them but otherwise I've felt no boost in concentration, even though I've been taking 20mg so double the dose (my neurologist trusts me to play with the dosage according me needs). 

How can I know when meds are really working for me? Also to students here, what do you guys take? I go back home in April and I want to discuss trying out new meds with my neurologist.

I want to thank everyone for their suggestions to have the baristas write on the coffee cups my wife received. I have finally ended the prank and it went off extremely well. I have shared some of the pics of the cups that were made and delivered. I showed her the original Reddit post and she was appalled at how many people in here were calling for a divorce for such a “silly and non malicious prank.” When I read her the comment from someone who claimed I was “psychologically torturing” her she laughed out loud, literally. She made instagram story posts about this whole situation as it unfolded, warranting a lot of responses from her friends. What I didn’t expect was that Starbucks themselves would make a policy encouraging employees to add personal messages on cups. This came out directly in the middle of my prank, so it allowed me a little more freedom. She did state that she’s “in it for the long game” and she will “get you back when you least suspect it.” So I know something is coming I just don’t know when…. But that’s okay by me.

1jcqvb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horreur/comments/1jcqvb7/cursed_past/,Cursed past,"Lucas: The Man Who Regretted Nothing

It had all started like a perfect story.

Lucas met Sarah in college. She was beautiful, kind, and understood his ambitions. He wanted to succeed, build a career, make a name for himself. She supported him, encouraged him, believed in him even more than he did himself.

They got married after a few years of dating, and soon, a baby completed their family. A little boy, Ethan. Sarah radiated happiness as she held him in her arms. Lucas, on the other hand, felt proud. He had everything a man could dream of: a loving family and a promising future.

But deep down, something was suffocating him.

The sleepless nights, the responsibilities, the baby’s constant cries… The routine. Sarah, once so attentive, was tired, preoccupied. He felt less desired, less important. As if his role as a man now came after his role as a father.

And that was when she appeared in his life.

A coworker. Smiling, seductive, spontaneous. Nothing serious, just lingering glances, conversations that lasted a little too long. Then one night, he hadn’t resisted.



The First Betrayal

It was exhilarating.

The forbidden. The adrenaline. The feeling of becoming a man again, not just a husband or a father.

That night, when he came home, he felt no guilt. Sarah was asleep, exhausted. Ethan cried in the next room. Lucas simply lay down beside his wife as if nothing had happened.

And the next day, life went on as usual.

He had cheated on his wife, and nothing had changed.

So why stop there?


The Habit of Lying

Over time, he did it again.

A new woman. Then another. Coworkers, strangers met in bars, meaningless affairs. He felt powerful. Untouchable.

Every night, he came home, kissed Sarah, spent a little time with Ethan to keep up appearances. He played the role of the perfect husband. And no one suspected a thing.

He felt neither remorse nor fear. On the contrary, he was more confident than ever.

Sarah continued to be the devoted wife who believed in him. She never asked questions. She trusted him.

And Lucas took advantage of it.



The Discovery and the Departure

Until the day everything fell apart.

He didn’t know how she had discovered the truth. A message he forgot to delete? A suspicious bill? A foreign perfume on his shirt? It didn’t matter.

That night, when he came home, he found Sarah sitting in the living room, Ethan asleep in her arms.

She wasn’t crying. She wasn’t yelling.

She simply looked at him and said:

""I’m leaving.""

Lucas stood still, as if the words didn’t make sense.

She got up, packed a few things, and left with their son without another word.

And the strangest thing was that, at that moment, he still felt nothing.

No pain. No regret.

Just a void, which he quickly filled.



A New Life, Without Regrets

Days passed, then weeks, then years.

Sarah and Ethan became ghosts of his past. He focused on his work, climbed the ranks, found a new girlfriend. A woman without children, without complications, with whom he could simply enjoy life.

He never looked back.

Never tried to see his son.

Why would he? He had never had regrets.

Until that day.



The Woman in the Café

It was an afternoon like any other. He walked into a café, ordered an espresso, lost in thought.

Then his gaze fell on a woman, sitting alone at a table.

She had a baby with her. A little boy, no older than Ethan had been back then.

She looked tired. Her dark circles were deep, her features drawn. She drank her coffee in silence, her gaze empty.

And something inside him cracked.

Without knowing why, a wave of memories crashed down on him.

Sarah. Ethan.

His son, growing up without him.

His wife, who had perhaps worn that same exhausted expression after she left.

A strange sensation settled in him. A heaviness he had never felt before.

And that’s when he saw her.



The Encounter with Horror

In the street, just across from the café, a woman stood motionless.

She didn’t move.

She was staring at him.

Her face seemed… normal. Too normal. As if it had been crafted to imitate humanity, without ever truly succeeding.

The sky was a sickly gray, the wind howled, icy.

A shiver ran down his spine.

He blinked.

She was gone.

And that night, he couldn’t sleep.

The memories he had always buried resurfaced—brutal, unbearable.

Then came the nightmares.

And every night, she was there.

Always closer. Always more oppressive.

Until the day he realized it wasn’t just a dream…
The Beginning of the Visions

The first signs were subtle.

A blurry silhouette seen in a reflection. An unexplained cold draft. A barely perceptible whisper behind him.

Then the nightmares arrived.

At night, he dreamed of Ethan. His son called out to him with a distorted, distant voice. But when he turned around…

He saw a baby with no eyes.

A smooth face, no eye sockets, an expression frozen in silent accusation.

He always woke up in a panic, breathless, unable to understand why the vision horrified him so much.

But that was only the beginning.

The Mistake at the Bar

One evening, while drinking with friends at a bar, his growing anxiety reached a breaking point.

He barely spoke, nervous, constantly scanning the room. Then, his gaze locked onto a woman outside.

She was there.

Standing beneath the pale glow of a streetlamp. Motionless. Staring at him.

His heart pounded violently in his chest.

Without thinking, he shot up, knocking over his drink, and stormed outside.

— ""What do you want from me?!"" he screamed, shoving the woman.

She fell hard to the ground, her eyes wide with fear.

But it wasn’t the creature.

It was just a stranger trying to cross the street.

His friends rushed over, horrified.

— ""Lucas, what the fuck is wrong with you?!""

He staggered back, his hands shaking.

— ""I… I thought…""

He backed away again—then ran.

Once home, he locked himself in his room and broke down in tears.

He was losing his mind.

The Near-Death Accident

Days later, he wandered the streets, exhausted, his gaze vacant.

The wind blew, freezing. The air felt heavier, as if the world weighed on his shoulders.

He stumbled along the sidewalk, his eyelids heavy, his vision blurred.

Then, he stepped forward.

A horn blared.

He looked up just in time.

A truck was speeding toward him.

His body reacted before his mind. He threw himself backward, crashing onto the pavement.

The monstrous vehicle roared past, missing him by inches.

Lucas remained there, on his knees, shaking, barely realizing he had just escaped death.

Then he looked up.

On the opposite sidewalk, she was there.

Her long, cadaverous body stood out against the darkness.

And this time, she was smiling.



Lucas: The Creature’s Judgment

Lucas had never believed in karma.

All his life, he had done whatever he wanted without facing any consequences. He had cheated, lied, destroyed his marriage, abandoned his son… and yet, everything had always gone well for him.

Until she appeared.



The Beginning of the Fall

The nights had become a nightmare.

At first, it was just a feeling of unease, a sense of being watched. Then the nightmares came. She was always there, motionless, closer each time.

The lack of sleep was eating away at him.

At work, he had become distracted, unable to focus. His colleagues noticed he wasn’t the same anymore. His boss, worried about seeing him deteriorate, granted him two weeks off so he could rest.

But rest was impossible.

His girlfriend, at first understanding, tried to help.

— Why don’t you sleep anymore? she asked.
— She’s there… She’s watching me… he murmured, dazed.

His eyes were hollow, haunted. Dark circles marked his face, his hands trembled.

Then came the night when everything changed.



The Attack of Paranoia

He finally fell asleep, but his sleep was worse than being awake.

In his nightmare, he was alone in an empty room, and she was there.

Her final form. Immense. Inhumanly thin. Her long, sinister body moved slowly, but he knew she could reach him in an instant.

She didn’t speak.

She only cried.

But her cries were not human. A twisted, eerie sound, a blend of agony and madness.

He woke up with a jolt, gasping for air.

And that’s when he saw her.

In the darkness of the bedroom, a silhouette stood beside him.

His heart pounded violently in his chest. She was there.

Without thinking, he leaped out of bed and grabbed a knife from the kitchen.

The silhouette moved. He screamed, raised the blade—

—And his girlfriend let out a terrified cry.

He froze.

It wasn’t the creature.

It was her. His girlfriend.

She ran, never speaking to him again.



Alone with His Fate

Desperate, he sought a solution.

Sleeping pills.

Nothing.

He still couldn’t sleep.

Now he was alone. And she was coming.

That night, she didn’t wait for him to fall asleep.

And when she finally appeared—towering over him, her grotesque smile frozen in place—he understood.

He was being punished.

She vanished.

Lucas, trembling, broken, searched for Sarah and Ethan.

After two days, he found out.

Sarah was dead.

Murdered by burglars as she returned from a miserable job—one that barely let her feed their son.

Ethan was now an orphan.

A cold breath brushed against his neck.

He turned.

She was there.

He screamed:

— I’m sorry!

But it was too late.

A snap.

A crack.

Silence.

Lucas collapsed. Neck broken. Life ended.

His punishment complete.

Teaching is my passion, and I’m excited to keep growing in this rewarding field.

Physically, I’m 5’4” with deep brown almond-shaped eyes, average weight, medium-length dark brown hair, two pierced ears, and three tattoos.

I love life’s simple pleasures—sipping a cranberry vodka or gin and tonic while taking in the city lights, sharing a good laugh over coffee and cake, or getting lost in a bookstore for hours. I gravitate toward quiet moments over loud parties, deep conversations over small talk. Libraries, bookstores, and cozy coffee shops? Always a yes. And nothing beats the magic of a skyline at night or a late-night drive with the right company.

So, why am I here instead of on a dating app? Because modern dating feels like an endless loop—swipe, match, chat, meet, and realize there’s no spark. Rinse and repeat. I’m looking for something organic, real, and meaningful.

I want old-fashioned romance—the kind where real dates matter, where exploring the world together is more exciting than just “hanging out.” I love creating meaningful memories in real-life settings. **Also, if you’re the type to send good morning/good night texts and keep the energy consistent—congratulations, you’re already ahead of 90% of the dating pool.**

When I’m not working, you’ll find me writing, drawing, listening to synthwave, or watching nostalgic 80s/90s films. I’m a die-hard fan of the original *Gossip Girl* (2007—no reboot, please!) and would love a partner who’s down to binge it with me. Some of my favorite films include *Dogfight, Cruel Intentions, Stand By Me, Career Opportunities, Secret Admirer,* and *The Bling Ring.* My playlists are filled with dreamy tracks like *Sunset* by The Midnight, *Summer Eyes* by Coastal, and *Miracle Love* by Lazer Club.

While I treasure my independence, I’m ready to share my life with someone who feels like my best friend. I want a connection built on laughter, trust, and genuine care. I picture us as that couple with inside jokes, shared adventures, and unwavering support for each other. Romantic moments are my favorite—those quiet seconds when you lock eyes, smile, and just know.

**Also, let’s be real—I want a million guys flocking to me like pigeons to a dropped sandwich, but I’ll settle for the right one who actually puts in effort.**

# What I’m Looking For:

* **Age Range:** 28-37
* **Height:** Preferably 5’10” or taller
* **Build:** Slim/fit/lean
* **Lifestyle:** Drug-free (no molly, edibles, coke, etc.), moderate drinking is fine
* **Location:** Connecticut or within 25-35 miles (U.S./Canada preferred)
* **Relationship Goals:** Long-term, monogamous, with marriage potential—bonus points if you’re open to a family someday!

# A Few Must-Haves:

* You’re emotionally available, stable, and **single**
* You communicate openly and value consistency (the little things matter!)
* You’re excited about real dates and meaningful experiences
* You’re present in your current life, not caught up in the past

If you’re kind, stable, and looking for a relationship filled with joy, passion, and mutual respect, I’d love to hear from you! Send me a message, and if we vibe, I’m happy to exchange photos. Let’s see where this journey takes us. 💕",0,1742146492.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

For days on end, John and Evan looked outside their prison cell window and waited and waited for a day with thunderstorms. Eventually, a thunderstorm came at 1:30 AM with lightning crashing down from the heavens onto Earth.

“I’ve got the 20-foot lightning rod made of antennas.” Evan said.

“I’ve got the jar of battery acid and the bicycle chains that are attached to car hood hooks as grappling hooks.” John said.

Evan looked down the hallway to see if there were any guards around, and there were no guards in their area.

“Coast is clear!” Evan loudly whispered to John.

Evan and John tiptoed towards the electrical closet room and Evan stuck the lightning rod made of antennas up through a small crack in the ceiling into the sky where rain came pouring down. John then wired that lightning rod into the central electrical control panel.

“Now we just have to wait for it to be struck by lightning so that the prison’s power goes out and we can hop over the electric fence.” Evan said.

Two hours later, John and Evan saw a lightning bolt come through the small crack in the ceiling traveling down the lightning rod made of antennas and into the central electrical control panel, shorting it out. All of the lights in the prison went dark, and they realized that they successfully shorted out the power in the prison.

“Hurry, power-walk this way towards the prison yard. Don’t run or you’ll draw attention to yourself and the guards will notice you. If someone notices us and tries to catch us, then switch from power-walking to running.” John instructed Evan.

John and Evan powerwalked about 500 feet from the electrical closet to the backdoor past a few security guards who were all asleep, which makes sense considering that it was 3:30 in the morning.

John and Evan walked through the empty prison yard lit by the moon to the first wall.

“We’ll both take turns using my grappling hook first to get past this first wall with the electric fence, and we’ll take turns using your grappling hook to get past the second with the barbed wire.” Evan directed John. 

“Really, why can’t each of us just use one grappling hook for both walls?” John asked.

“Because these grappling hooks are single-use because once you’ve used them to ascend and descend the walls, you would have to re-ascend the walls so you could retrieve the grappling hooks, and then jump off the wall to unhook it and retrieve it. This would be both time-consuming and dangerous because if you jump off of the walls incorrectly, you could break a bone.” Evan explained.

“Well shit, I guess you’re right,” John replied
Evan held onto the end of the bicycle chain that was not attached to the car hood hooks, and threw the bicycle chain into the air, causing the end attached to the car hood hooks to latch onto the top of the electric fence that was shorted out due to the power outage. Evan went first, climbing up the bicycle chain with all of his might. He almost slipped, but he made it up to the top.

“Now it’s your turn to climb up. Once we're both at the top, I will start climbing down, as neither of us can climb down until both of us have climbed up.” Evan explained

“And why is that?” John asked

“Because someone has to re-adjust the grappling hook for us to start lowering ourselves on the other side of this wall in a safe manner, and if I have already lowered myself by the time you start climbing up, then no one will be at the top to re-adjust the grappling hook.” Evan replied.

“Fair point.” John replied.

John, who was much stronger than Evan, used his strength to propel himself up the bicycle chain. The chain almost broke under John’s weight, but John made it to the top successfully. Once John and Evan both were at the top of the wall, Evan re-adjusted the grappling hook position so that it pointed down the other side of the wall, allowing Evan and John to descend the wall on the other side. Evan climbed down first, then John. 

“One wall down, one wall to go,” John said

“With this 2nd wall with the barbed wires, we will treat it exactly like the first but because of the barbed wires, I will pour this battery acid on it, which will make that part of the barbed wire deteriorate which will allow us to go through the barbed wire and escape,” Evan explained
John grabbed his bicycle chain on the end that was not attached to the car hood hook and threw the other end into the air, as it latched onto the top of the 2nd wall with the barbed wire. Evan then grabbed the jar filled with battery acid and shoved it into his back pocket and climbed up the bicycle chain to the top of the wall with the barbed wire. Evan got out the jar and poured the battery acid onto the barbed wire, which caused it to melt, creating a clear passageway for John and Evan. John then climbed up the chain with Evan. Evan then re-adjusted the chain for it to go down the other side of the wall and slowly descended it to the other side, finally making his way to the outside of the prison into freedom. John followed Evan down the chain and was now also on the outside of the prison. As the sun started to rise, Evan and John heard sirens activating in the prison, meaning that they knew they had fixed the damaged power system and that they knew that Evan and John had escaped.

“First things first, we will be too recognizable in our orange uniforms. There’s a dumpster filled with all kinds of clothes with only tiny holes in them in the garbage behind the clothing store over there. Let’s get some new clothes so we don’t get caught.” John said. 
Evan and John both went into the dumpster and got themselves new clothes with a few holes in them and threw out their old prison uniforms so that they would not get caught.

“Look over there!” John said “There's a boxcar with a homeless person riding in it. Maybe we can ride in it to get away from this prison so that we don’t get caught.” John said.

“Good idea,” Evan replied.

Evan and John ran towards the boxcar train with a homeless man on it and hopped on. As soon as they hopped on, the homeless man said 

“Looks like this is my stop.”And hopped off. 

The boxcar train whisked Evan and John hundreds of miles away.

**Chapter 8: The Breakup**

The boxcar train that was carrying John and Evan was now hundreds of miles away west of the prison in an abandoned wilderness.

“Ok, so now that we have escaped prison, what will we do next?” Evan asked.

“We’ll probably flee to Mexico where the tax laws are very loosely enforced and we can get away with not paying taxes and not going to prison.” John replied.

“But I don’t want to go to Mexico, I want to go to Canada where there is an enormous welfare state and I can easily get away with welfare fraud and not go to prison,” Evan complained. 

“Well, I’m sure as hell not going to Canada where I’d be forced to spend all of my hard-earned tax dollars on lazy bums like you!” John yelled.

“Did you just call me a lazy bum?!” Evan snapped back as he grabbed John’s shoulder.

“That’s exactly what you are, a lazy bum!” John snapped as he threw Evan to the floor inside the boxcar train. “You’ve never worked a day in your life and all you ever do is leech off of hard-working taxpayers like me to pay for your luxurious lifestyle while I get none of the luxuries you can get. That’s exactly why I stopped paying taxes 20 years ago!”

“Fine, I’m going to Canada by myself.” Evan declared.

“I’m going to Mexico by myself.” John declared.

The boxcar train then stopped at Millennium Park Station in Chicago with networks of trains and train tracks going every which way. John and Evan both parted ways, as John snuck onto the back of a train going south to Mexico, while Evan snuck onto the back of a train going north to Canada. 

**Chapter 9: Monotony**

Once Evan rode that train from Chicago to Toronto he got a job as a safety inspector at a nuclear power plant and bought a cheap apartment downtown. The next few weeks were a steady routine for Evan: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed:

and so on. 

Evan loved having a steady routine for once, as this was something he had never had before as a criminal who was always running from the law. In Canada, he got a steady job and never resorted to welfare fraud. One day Evan was watching the news when he heard a disturbing report.

“This just in, a man named John was kidnapped and brutally beaten by the infamous gang MS-13” John’s full name and face were shown across the TV screen and a video was shown of John being tortured.

“Good riddance!” Evan said to himself “That’s what he gets for not listening to me and going to Mexico instead. I hope your tax evasion scheme worked out well.”

A few more weeks went by when Evan was subject to the same old monotonous routine: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed.  

And so on and so on.
Evan started to hate the monotony of the routine he once loved. He realized just how boring life had become without someone to argue with like John. Evan then became so lonely without John or anyone else in his life that he found himself pacing around the floor at his lunch break talking to himself, and his coworkers started to get weirded out. 

“Sure, I might be bored and lonely, but am I going to risk life and limb just to save someone I love to hate?” Evan said to himself while he was pacing around the lunchroom floor.

“Evan, what the hell are you doing? You’ve been pacing around talking to yourself in public all lunch break? You seem lonely and you need a friend!” Rick, one of Evan’s coworkers, yelled at Evan while they were in the coffee break room at the nuclear power plant. 

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!” 

Rick's words rang in Evan’s ears over and over again.

“A friend eh?” Evan said to himself. “I think I know just where one is in Tijuana, Mexico who just so happens to need my help.”

Evan sprinted out the door toward the parking lot

“What are you doing this time!?” Rick asked

“Risking my life to save someone I hate for reasons I don’t quite understand. Gotta go!” 

Evan yelled back at Rick as he sprinted out the door. He ran over to the nearby train station where he booked a ticket to Tijuana.

“Time to fight a drug cartel and kick ass!” Evan whispered to himself as he boarded the train to Tijuana.

**Chapter 10 Evan frees John**

The train got off in Tijuana in a train station in a sketchy ally with city maps for both English and Spanish telling tourists where various attractions and shops are, and one of them was a gun shop, which would allow Evan to get his hand on a weapon so he could take down MS-13 and save John. 
“Why is a gun shop one of the primary tourist destinations listed on the map?” Evan thought to himself out loud

“Mexico has very loose gun laws unlike Canada and the US, so people from across the border in San Diego cross the border all the time just to get guns.” a tourist responded to Evan.

“Oh, you speak English?” Evan asked.

“Yeah, virtually everyone in Tijuana speaks both English and Spanish,” the tourist responded.

Evan then found a currency exchange station where he exchanged his Canadian dollars for Mexican pesos. Evan then walked a few blocks to the nearby gun shop where he purchased a gun and some ammo to take down MS-13 to save his friend. As soon as he started to wonder how he could find MS-13, he saw a guy with a large MS-13 tattoo and asked him if he could join MS-13 as a new member.

“That’s a talk between you and the leader. I will take you to him, but to join MS-13, you first must prove your loyalty to him.” The guy with the MS-13 tattoo explained. 

Evan followed him through a maze of complex allies, each one sketchier than the last, into an enormous run-down warehouse-looking building with a 10-foot pyramid structure in the center, and at the top of the pyramid was a golden chair with a fat man sitting in it.

“Why have you come to bother me?!” the fat man snapped.

“We have a new potential recruit to MS-13.” the guy with the MS-13 tattoo replied.

“Hmmmmm, that’s odd, we haven’t had a recruit in several years. Well, I guess we could always use more members.” the fat man said to himself “Your loyalty test to this organization will be that you are required to assassinate Tijuana city council member Luis Francheco and have his corpse brought to me. He is the primary member of the Tijuana city council who is trying to push corruption out of the Tijuana city government and we rely on that corruption so that we can continue to bribe the government officials so that they don’t arrest us. Do you understand?”

“Yes sir,” Evan replied. “Do you by chance happen to know where you guys keep your prisoners?” 

“That is confidential information that I can not tell you until you have brought Luis Francheso’s corpse to me.” The fat man replied.

“Understood.” Evan replied.

Evan walked out of the MS-13 layer and walked a few blocks until he saw an ally where he could buy some roofies. Evan then ran his next errand to a local grocery store where he purchased a big bottle of wine and a pen and a thank you card where he wrote “Thank you Mr. Franchesco for being the best city council member, we have a gift for you in the form of a bottle of wine.” Once Evan was out of the store, he opened the bottle of wine and opened the package of roofies and dumped the roofies into the wine bottle. Last but not least, Evan got on a bus and went to the outskirts of town where he saw a farm. He snuck onto that farm and slaughtered one of the pigs and emptied the blood from the pig’s carcass into the same jar he used to carry the battery acid during their escape from prison. Evan then rode the bus to city hall and went into Mr. Franchesco’s office and put the thank you card and the bottle of wine on his desk. Evan then heard Mr. Franchesco’s footsteps down the hallway approaching his room at the end of the hallway, so Evan hid in the closet in Mr. Franchesco’s office and peeped through the ventilation desk to see Mr. Francesco sit down in his office chair.

“Oh Boy!” Mr. Franchesco said to himself “Someone’s left a big bottle of wine and a thank you card for me. I normally don’t drink at work, but it’s 4 pm, so I guess we can make an exception here. Plus it’s been a long stressful day for me. “Juan, my assistant, can you take a sip of this wine for me please so that I don’t get poisoned?.. Oh, I forgot, he’s out sick today.”

Evan quietly breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing that Mr. Franchesco’s taster assistant was out sick today, and Mr. Francesco took a sip of the wine and instantly passed out. Evan then looked in the hallways to see that no one was coming, and he saw that no one was there, so Evan dragged Mr. Franchesco’s unconscious body out the door. Once he was out the door, Evan dumped the vile of pig blood all over Mr. Franchesco’s dead body to make it look like he killed him. Evan then used all of his strength to drag Mr. Franchesco’s body to the MS-13 lay and present it below the fat man who led MS-13. 

“Excellent work.” the fat man said to Evan. “You are officially now our newest member.”

“So where exactly does MS-13 keep their prisoners?”

“We keep them at 4-303 Bolivar Rd. When you get out of the warehouse, you make a right out of the driveway onto our street and go down it 6 blocks and then you make a left onto Bolivar Road. You will then go down 3 and a half more blocks and you will come across 4-303 bolivar road on your left. I am granting you this MS-13 badge. Just show the guards this badge and they will let you in. May I ask why do you want to go into our gang prison?” The fat man replied.

“Because there’s this guy in there named John who I am going to shoot with my pistol because he’s behind on his mortgage to me. I lent him a car, and he has now been behind on his monthly payments for 6 months in a row, so I’m going to show him why you don’t mess with me” Evan responded.
“Well, we hate John too. We only captured him in the hope that we could hold him ransom for the US government, and because they have refused to buy him from us, he’s essentially a useless prisoner who you are free to kill.” The fat man replied. 

John walked 6 blocks, turned left at Bolivar Road, walked 3 and a half blocks more, and found 4-303 Bolivar Road and opened the door to get in. Once he opened that door, there was a short hallway with a door at the end with two more guards who both had guns both pointed at Evan and announced.

“Halt! Please show us your ID and your purpose for the entry” 

“I have been sent here to kill prisoner John,” Evan announced. “The boss ordered for him to be killed because we were unable to sell him for ransom back to the US government. Here is my ID.” Evan showed him the badge

“Your entry is granted!” the guards stepped out of the way and withdrew their guns. “Here is the key to Evan’s cell.”

 Evan then walked through the maze of cells filled with prisoners who were beaten, bloodied, and battered, until he came across the one he was here for. He approached John’s cell and unlocked it.

“Evan?” John asked, with blood pouring out of wounds on his torso and arms

“Yes, it’s me, Evan,” Evan replied. “I’m here to set you free.”

Evan and John then both ran out of the prison, with Evan using his gun to shoot both of the prison guards in the knee and freeing John from the torture of the MS-13 prison. 

“I can't believe you risked your life to save me?!” John said as he hugged Evan and cried

“Shhhh!” Evan whispered loudly “We have to be quiet and remain out of sight. MS-13 could send out reinforcements anytime.

As John and Evan ran through the city of Tijuana towards the train station, they passed by this electronic store with an enormous glass window with multiple TVs in the store showing through the glass onto the streets where people could watch the TVs. One of those TVs in the electronics store showing on the street had the news on, and it showed that the President of the United States’s 13-year-old daughter had been kidnapped by a gang called the Tijuana Cartel and that the president was offering a reward of a million dollars to whoever could rescue the president’s daughter.

“Are you thinking what I am thinking?” John asked Evan
“That we could get a million dollars from saving the President’s daughter from the Tijuana Cartel?” Evan replied.

“Better yet, we could get a presidential pardon for our crimes if we save the president’s daughter from the Tijuana Cartel and get our criminal records expunged.” John replied

“Good idea.” Evan replied.

“Freeze” John and Evan both heard as five gunmen and a leader approached John and Evan at the electronics store with the TVs that showed out into the streets and were about to shoot them then and there. 

“Do you have any last words before MS-13 kills you?” The leader of the gunman asked.
 Evan pulled out his gun to try to shoot them in self-defense, but it was no use as Evan was out of ammo and at the mercy of the five MS-13 gunmen.

“Thanks for saving my life by rescuing me from the MS-13 prison. John said to Evan “Even if it only extended my life for five more minutes.”

“Be prepared to die!” the leader of the gunman said as the five gunmen all cocked their guns and aimed at Evan and John, as they flinched, knowing that this would be the end. The five gunmen all had their fingers on the triggers about to shoot and end Evan and John’s life when suddenly the five gunmen and their leader all fell and had bullet-holes in their torsos with blood oozing out on the sidewalk at the Electronic store with the TVs pointing out to the streets. 

“Whoever you are, thank you for saving our lives.” Evan and John said.

“Call me Enedina, the leader of the Tijuana Cartel.” A woman stepped out of a shadowy ally with smoke coming out of her AR-15. “MS-13 has been one of our biggest rivals in the gang war, and your escape has certainly made headlines in the news of the criminal underworld, and for publicly slapping the face of our biggest rival, we want to make you the newest member of the Tijuana Cartel.

“Hold on, I need to have one moment alone with my associate,” Evan said

“Take your time,” Enedina said

“John, is this the same Tijuana Cartel that has kidnapped the President’s daughter?” Evan whispered to John.

“It sure is.” John replied, whispering to Evan. 

“Ok, so we will join and then free the president’s daughter.” Evan replied whispering to John.
“We will join the Tijuana Cartel with you.” Evan and John said to Enedina.

“It’s always good to have two new members,” Enedina replied.

**Chapter 11: a presidential pardon**

John and Evan were welcomed into the layer of the Tijuana Cartel, and they asked Enedina if they could have some more bandages for John’s wounds and ammo for Evan’s gun and Enedina happily provided those to them. 

“Enedina, would you know where we keep the Tijuana Cartel gang prisoners?” John asked

“We keep them at 3-506 Zaragoza Road. You have to first get a right out of the driveway and then go down the street for 4 blocks and make a left onto Zaragoza Road. You go down the road for about half a block and you will see 3-506 Zaragoza on your right. May I ask why you want to go down to where the prisoners are kept?” Enedina replied.

“We were looking to kill the President of the United State’s daughter. We have fed her for days, yet the president still shows no sign of paying her ransom or doing anything, so we have no other choice but to kill her as she means nothing to us now.” Evan replied.

“Yeah, you have a fair point. I see no reason why the president’s daughter needs to live. We’ve broadcasted her face all over the news for days and everyone knows that she has been kidnapped and if the president wanted to save her or pay her ransom, he would have easily done that by now. I permit you to go kill the president’s daughter in her jail cell. Here’s a Tijuana Cartel badge. Present this badge to the guards outside and they should let you into the President’s daughter’s cell. 

John and Evan took a right out of the driveway and walked 4 blocks, turned left, walked another half block, and came across 3-506 Zaragoza Road. They opened the door and then walked into a very short 5-foot-long hallway with another door at the end with two guards with guns both pointed at them.

“Halt!” The guards shouted “Show us your authorization and purpose for the entry.”

“We are with the Tijuana Cartel and we have been sent here to kill the President’s daughter, as we have held her for ransom for days, and yet the president has done nothing to save her or pay her ransom, so we have decided that the best use of resources is to simply kill her so we don’t waste our resources feeding her.” John stated.

“Here is our Tijuana Cartel badge handed to us by Enedina.” Evan stated.
 
“You are free to enter our prison, here’s the key to the president’s daughter’s cell.” The guards stated.

John and Evan walked through the Tijuana Cartel Prison with prisoners in every shade of orange, each one looking scarier than the last until they came across the sweet-looking face of the president’s 13-year-old daughter. John unlocked the key while Evan entered the cell and leaned into the president’s daughter’s ear and whispered that they were there to save her life.

“Yippie!” the President’s daughter shouted.

“Shhhhh!” Evan whispered loudly.

 Evan and the President’s daughter exited the cell and joined up with John who was outside of the cell. John, Evan, and the President’s daughter all walked swiftly but calmly towards the entrance they came in, as Evan got out his gun and shot the guards in the knees before they could suspect anything, meaning that John and Evan had now just freed the President’s daughter. The trio then started running away from the prison northward towards the US border.

“Next stop, to San Diego across the border,” Evan said panting while running. “I brought a makeshift grappling hook made of bicycle chains and a car hood that we can use to hop the Tortilla wall that separates Tijuana and San Diego.”

“Ugh, do we have to use one of those? Last time I used one of those I almost fell off of the prison . . . I mean a city wall.” John coughed and awkwardly corrected himself as he noticed the president’s 13-year-old daughter look at him as he slipped up and said he escaped from prison.

“Wait, you two are outlaws?” The president’s daughter asked John and Evan.

“*sigh* yes,” John and Evan said in unison as the trio all continued to pant in unison as they were running towards the border while talking.

“Awesome!” the president’s daughter squealed. “I've always wanted to meet an outlaw, but my dad won’t let me walk outside without secret service supervision and engage in any fun activities that kids my age do like spray painting and skateboarding.”

The trio continued to run and they were less than a block away from the Tortilla wall at the US-Mexico border when 6 men with guns all blocked the street in front of them and pointed their guns at the trio and said

“Freeze, we have orders to terminate you by the Tijuana Cartel!”

Evan once again reached for his pistol and tried to fire it, but it was jammed and unable to fire. John, Evan, and The President’s daughter all cowered there helplessly in fear and saw their entire life flash before their eyes, and time stood still, knowing that the gun of the Tijuana Cartel was about to end their very lives within the flash of a second.

“On my command fire,” Their leader shouted. 

The 6 gunmen all cocked their guns and aimed at the trio, when all of a sudden, two attack helicopters with American flags came out of the air and shot all 6 gunmen, and all 6 fell with bullet holes in their torsos and blood oozing out on the sidewalk less than a block away from the Tortilla wall. After the two attack helicopters shot down the 6 gunmen, Airforce One descended onto the ground in front of the trio. The president opened the door to the plane and the stairs descended to the sidewalk where John, Evan, and the president’s daughter were all standing.

“Hop on in honey!” The president announced “Who are your two new friends”

“They just saved me from prison in the Tijuana Cartel by pretending to join the organization and then double-crossing them to save me.” The president’s daughter explained. “Can they come too?”

The president stood there for a long moment, seeing that these guys were sketchy and looked like convicts themselves, the president would normally let these types of guys into his plane, but considering that they had just saved his daughter, he reluctantly agreed to let them in. The trio climbed into Air Force One, and Airforce One took off towards Washington DC.

“Before I say anything else, I just want to say that I am incredibly sorry that I didn’t come and save you earlier and that you were captured for over a week.” The president went on. “You see when I first got to Tijuana to have a meeting with the President of Mexico, I received anonymous death threats, so I was ordered by my secret service to abandon my meeting in Mexico and to flee to an undisclosed location in Nevada that had no cell signal, broadband, or internet for my safety so I had no way of knowing that you were captured. Before I left Tijuana for the undisclosed place in Nevada, I decided that for your safety, it would be best for you to stay behind in Tijuana with my presidential aide named Edwin, as I knew that keeping you with me in New Mexico would put you in more danger as I am the one they are after not you. If I had known that Edwin was such a heavy sleeper and wouldn’t detect kidnappers breaking into the house in the middle of the night, I would have never assigned him to protect you and I would have assigned someone else to protect you instead. I only found out that you had been captured once the secret service traveled to my undisclosed place in Nevada by car and informed me that you had been captured.” The president explained.

“It doesn’t matter now.” The president’s daughter said “What matters is that you and I are safe and together” as they both hugged and embraced, as a tear fell on both of their cheeks
. 
“And you two” the president motioned towards Evan and John “What made you two risk your life to save my daughter.”
Evan told his story about how he is a far-left activist who was arrested for welfare fraud, befriended his assigned cellmate who was a far-right activist who was arrested for tax evasion, and how they worked together to Escape prison. Then Evan went on to describe how they both planned to flee the country and for Canada, but then John and Evan got into a fight when they got out of prison and John went to Mexico while Evan went to Canada, and Evan found out that John had been captured while watching the news, so Evan went down to Mexico to save his friend. While they were in Mexico, they both saw the news about how the President of the United States’s daughter had been kidnapped, and they both agreed to break her out to receive a presidential pardon for their crimes. 

“A welfare queen and a tax evader working together?! That’s odd.” The president responded. “If only I could get along with members on the opposite side of the aisle in Congress as you do.” The president chuckled.

“Would you grant us a pardon?” John asked, “We have been through hell and back just to get to here, and we saved your daughter from death and we promise that we won’t do it again after having been on the run from the law for several months which taught us our lesson.”

“Normally, I would say no, but because of your heroism in risking your life to save my daughter from death, I will agree to grant you a full presidential pardon for your crimes, but be warned however, this pardon does not protect you from future crimes that you commit, so you can’t abuse the welfare system anymore and you can’t evade taxes anymore.” The president said.

“We promise we’ll be good from now on!” John and Evan said.

“This might be a weird request for you guys, but how would you two like to work at an entry-level job in the FBI for me? Our FBI has currently been ineffective at catching criminals, and I think the reason why they are is that none of them are ex-criminals, meaning they know nothing about how a criminal thinks or behaves, so we were wondering if you would like to take on a job in the FBI hunting these guys down?”

“That sounds good!” John squealed.

“Having a steady job for once in my life would mean that I would no longer have to resort to a life of crime” Evan cheered. 

“Thank you, Mr. President!” John and Evan said.

“You’re welcome.” The president replied.

Air Force One had just touched down in Washington DC, and John, Evan, and the President’s daughter all decided that they would get motorcycles, matching switchblades, and matching tattoos that read “Kill all betrayers” (although the President’s daughter’s was a temporary tattoo, as she wasn’t old enough to get a real one.) The president then approached John, Evan, and the President’s daughter with their matching motorcycles, tattoos, and switchblades, looking at his daughter with disgust for her new punk lifestyle.

“Honey, would you like to come with your dad on a cool diplomatic trip in Wilmington Delaware? There would be lots of tall chairs for you to sit in.” The president bribed his daughter.

“No thanks. I’m tired of going on trips that involve people in itchy clothing bitching at each other. I’d rather hang out with my cool new friends John and Evan!” The president’s daughter replied as she mounted on her motorcycle, as John and Evan each mounted onto their own.

“Well, you three have fun while I’m gone!” The president shouted as the three of them raced away on their motorcycles. 

“Secret service, follow them at a distance!” The president whispered to his secret service agents who proceeded to get in their motorcycles and follow them at a distance.

Hello good people,

I hope you’re all well. I’m here kindly asking if anyone around Arusha is soon flying back to the USA (Indiana) or Italy, or even knows someone who is. I run a small, local coffee roasting business here, and I’ve been trying so hard to share our premium, traditionally roasted Kilimanjaro coffee with a few friends abroad who really want to taste authentic Tanzanian beans.

But honestly, the process of shipping even small amounts like 400 grams from Tanzania has become such a nightmare. The postal costs are insanely high, and on top of that, there are so many bureaucratic restrictions and expensive export licenses just to send a simple gift. It’s really disheartening how our own government gatekeeps local farmers and small roasters from exporting what should be a proud, shared piece of Tanzanian culture. You’d think we’re trying to smuggle gold the way they make things complicated.

And yet, this is something that helps promote our country, supports small businesses, and shares the beauty of Tanzanian coffee with the world. But somehow, we’re locked out unless we can afford fees meant for massive exporters.

So here I am humbly asking, if you or someone you know is traveling soon from Arusha to the USA or Italy, and wouldn’t mind helping me out by carrying 400g of coffee in your luggage and posting it once you arrive I would be extremely grateful. I’ll handle the costs of local postage from there, of course. And as a small thank you, I’d love to gift you your own 400g bag of our best roast to enjoy as well.

If this speaks to you or you can help, please DM me. You’d really be helping na Asante sana.",5,1742146058.0,Kenya,0,1.0,False

Me - Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice

Charles - if youre serious we'll address this in person. these things can wait until face to face interaction because im not sure what the tone is. I'm not a fan of texting to begin with. but I meant no harm in what I said and I'll be glad to clarify in person

Me- Put your ego to the side and acknowledge what you said was arrogant

Charles - im not addressing this here. we'll talk in person.

Me- Either call me or say sorry via text and we can move forward

Charles - no. call me if you want.

me- What’s the big deal, are you in a meeting and can’t talk ?

Charles - I told u I don't like texting. either you call me or I see u in person. make the decision .

me - I have a better suggestion, if I decide to meet you in person will you promise to apologize ?. In addition, I’d like for you to explain why you think I’m not capable of formulating my own opinions and thoughts. Two things for you to reflect on. If you promise to apologize in person, I’ll come. Let me know. No insults, no threats will be exchanged.

Charles - I'm not promising anything. we'll talk like reasonable men.

me - What does that mean bro, it’s a simple question . Anyways, I can tell you are offended by the way you hung up on me. You changed from ""either call me or talk to me in person"" to ""talk to me in person"". Not so reasonable in my books I’ll be on campus after I finish my laundry and the clothes dry. Offended because I said ""ego guy"".

Charles : I’ll see u then

me - Saying sorry doesn’t make you less of a man, just want to put that out there. I’m letting you know now, if you don’t apologize within 2 minutes of meeting I’m walking away.

Charles - so don't come. I told u I don't respond well to threats. stop texting me I told you to meet there. we're reasonable men, im not worried about face to face interaction

me - That’s the issue, this isn’t a threat Charles it’s an expectation. Learn the difference

Charles - ok see u there.

me - Can I answer this truthfully? I don’t think you’ve been reasonable since I’ve addressed this head on. But, if you feel you have, please enlighten me . just out of curiosity, what does face to face change for you.

Charles - I told you stop texting me. I don't want to text.

me - Lastly, when you apologize within two minutes of meeting, you’re going to equally say sorry for claiming I was bullying you For someone who I’ve told my entire life to (especially in fine detail of how I was bullied) I’d assume you wouldn’t jump to that conclusion

Charles - see u there.

me - im not coming

Charles - I respect that im ready to meet when u are but I will have no one dictate what im going to say, how, and when, I have no problem apologizing but after discussing things in person. no weapons formed against me, including threats, shall prosper. see u soon.

me - I hear u and I respect your stance as well. I agree that it's important to have a real conversation in person. let's meet and talk things through. I just want to make sure we both have a constructive and respectful convo when the time comes. Just to clarify, I wasn't threatening nobody.

Charles - excellent, I admire this. let me know when.

me - to be frank, but you are being very unreasonable when someone addresses your arrogant comments.

Charles - there you go again, ill see u soon.

me - I don't appreciate this man, especially from you who is, more often than not, very understanding. this 180 flip doesn't make sense to me. at least tell me the time and place rather than repeatedly saying see u soon.

Charles - today anytime past 4.

me - cool.

\-as we're approaching 4.

Charles - lets make it after 5.

me - why what happened

Charles - ill be late if u come around that time.

me - why? dude, what changed. when we chat today, im not looking for arguments Charles. I hope ive made that clear im also not looking for passive aggressive behaviour like u did on the phone. if we even are going to chat today, I don't even know if youre going to show up.

Charles - ill see u after 5

me - not if you plan on arguing. I need a clear answer. Last time, u got extremely emotional during our convo and I don't want that to happen again.

(I call him and he doesn't pick up)

Charles - can I call u later ?

me - up to you. what time. be precise. Forget it, this is too much hassle for you to see how arrogant your comment was and it’s not guaranteed that you won’t be combattive. see u another day.

Charles - Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.

me - im coming. let me get dressed and ready my clothes is still drying

Charles - ok

me - would u like to have a meal together brother ?

Charles - thank you but im afraid I just ate. im down for coffee or tea while u eat.

me - if its gonna be our last time, lets eat don't be like that

Charles - im actually full no joke.

me - even some fries ? or an appetizer

Charles - a drink is the most I can. imagine was expecting to be at the library so I ate beforehand.

\-(we met and I already told u how the interaction went in person then I sent him this)

me - I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop. I’m not interested in ever being friends after this.

You know I've been stressed about my presentation, and today's the big day finally. I feel you slip into the shower behind me. I think it's to save time. I feel your hand slid around my waist from behind, and wrap around me. Do you finish me with your hand to release the tension, or does it lead to more?

I feel your hand slip under my Pjs, and whisper ""Let's have some fun while they're asleep."" One thing leads to another and we make love on the couch.

I’m trying to study for the CPA and I cannot get myself to focus or if I watch videos, I will retain nothing even though I’ll be actively note taking. 

Any suggestions on supplements that help with this? 

I’ve seen stuff about lion’s mane on here, but am getting confused about brands and things as I’ve been reading some conflicting stuff. I’ve also seen people sayin the effectiveness goes down the longer you take it?

Also- any thoughts on Ryse coffee?considering it because it seems like a simple way to incorporate lions mane into everyday.

Perhaps someone here has experienced similar results?


So 2 weeks into carnivore I got some labs done. My cholesterol was kind of bad, but I figured it would improve further down the line. I did a whole bunch of tests, but apart form cholesterol, lipase stood out which is also worrying me.

The results were:

    Total 279,00 mg/dl
    HDL 40,70 mg/dl
    LDL 191,56 mg/dl
    Triglicerydes 241,00 mg/dl
    Lipase: 87,2 U/l (where the norm is 13-60)

8 weeks into the diet, I've repeated those, so these are 6 weeks later:

    Total 259,00 mg/dl
    HDL 34,7 mg/dl
    LDL 164,38mg/dl
    Triglicerydes 315,00 mg/dl
    Lipase: 98,7 U/l

I wasn't feeling particularly good on carnivore, but not worse than on any other diet before. My arm/back pains have resolved. My carnivore diet was 99% ground beef, tea, coffee + milk. I've lost about 8kg in those 8 weeks, still overweight at 105kg (231lb) and 182cm height (5,9ft). I'm kind of freaking out now. These last results were 2 weeks ago and since then I've switched to low carb. Will test in a month again. 

Anyone has any ideas why these results might be so bad? I was expecting HDL to go up and triglicerydes to go down at the very least.",1,1742145135.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

1jcqawl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Machines/comments/1jcqawl/reddit_opinion_on_moccamaster_coffee_maker/,Reddit Opinion on Moccamaster coffee maker,"Based on the discussions in the Reddit threads, the primary reasons and justifications given by users for purchasing a Moccamaster coffee maker include:

• Excellent Coffee Quality and Consistency: Many users report that the Moccamaster brews exceptionally good and consistent drip coffee. Some even feel it's a significant upgrade from cheaper machines, resulting in smoother coffee with noticeable differences in taste. It is sometimes described as an automatic pour-over, suggesting a higher quality brew than standard drip machines.

• Durability and Longevity: A significant reason for purchase is the Moccamaster's reputation for being a durable and long-lasting product. Many users report owning their machines for over a decade without major issues.

• Repairability and Availability of Replacement Parts: A crucial justification for the high cost is the availability of replacement parts for all units, even those no longer in production. Users appreciate the ability to repair the machine themselves (DIY) if needed after the warranty period. This fixability is seen as a major advantage over cheaper machines that would need complete replacement.

• Warranty and Customer Service: The standard warranty is 5 years, and a 60th-anniversary edition offers a lifetime warranty. Even out of warranty, the company offers repairs for a fee. Many users have positive experiences with Moccamaster's customer service, citing instances where they received free replacement parts or had their machines repaired effectively, even after many years of use. However, one user reported a mixed experience with warranty service between European and North American teams, and another was not fully satisfied with a repair.

• Simple and Well-Engineered Design: The Moccamaster is praised for its simple yet carefully engineered design that focuses on brewing good coffee without unnecessary features. Some users prefer this simplicity over machines with more features that might be prone to failure or overcomplicate the brewing process.

• Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness: While the initial cost is high, some users argue that the Moccamaster can be more economical in the long run compared to frequently replacing cheaper coffee makers. One user estimated that based on their previous spending on coffee makers, the Moccamaster paid for itself over time due to its longevity. Replacing Nespresso pods at $40 a month also makes the Moccamaster seem potentially cost-effective in the long run for those seeking an alternative.

• Aesthetics: The visual design of the Moccamaster is also a factor for some buyers, who find it looks great on their countertops.

• Fast Brewing Time: Several users mention the speed at which the Moccamaster brews coffee, making a delay start feature less necessary for them.

It is important to note that some users find the Moccamaster overpriced compared to other options that might produce similar coffee, and alternatives like pour-over setups, French presses, or other SCA-certified brewers are suggested as potentially more cost-effective or offering comparable quality. Some users also mentioned minor design flaws or issues like the water tank lid or potential for the carafe to misalign. Additionally, a few users reported dissatisfaction with the coffee produced or the plastic components used in the machine. However, the overwhelming sentiment in the discussion leans towards the Moccamaster being a worthwhile investment for those who value quality, durability, and repairability in a drip coffee maker.",1,1742145084.0,Coffee_Machines,0,1.0,False

I’ve had an unusual connection with someone (let’s call her Emma) that has left me questioning whether there’s a deeper spiritual meaning behind it. I’m a woman too fyi and never thought I might be bi, probably I’m not. 

Our Initial Interaction
- We met about 15 months ago, and from the very first moment I saw her in a crowded room, I felt an immediate, intense attraction—but not necessarily romantic.

- Later, we locked eyes in a restroom, and I felt an overwhelming sense of familiarity, like I had known her forever. She remembers this moment too.

-That same evening, I presented a project, and she asked for my number and invited me for coffee.


How Our Connection Evolved
- After meeting her, more and more synchronicities and signs started appearing in my life. It felt like I was somehow connected to the universe in a way I hadn’t experienced before.

- I met random people who played short but significant roles in my life, almost as if they were meant to guide me toward something.

- At the same time, I kept seeing her name everywhere—on social media, in movies, music, books, and even in random online comments.

- I couldn’t stop thinking about her, and at some point, I even felt like she was just another version of me.

- At one point, I thought I had a crush on her and confessed it, but when she told me she wasn’t interested, I actually felt relief.

- Even though we didn’t have a close friendship, I kept feeling like our connection was significant.

- We drifted apart, and at some point, she even unfollowed me on social media.


Strange Synchronicities & Dreams
- After we stopped talking, the synchronicities continued, and her name kept appearing in unexpected places.

- I had a dream where I saw her struggling in a divided room, with one side feeling cold and filled with anxiety. It felt like I was observing her without being physically present.

- Another dream, right after my mother passed away, involved someone falsely accusing me of something, and I somehow knew Emma was behind it in the dream.

- Actually, I had her in many of my dreams, I just don’t  remember them all. 


Recent Unexplainable Occurrences
- Even though my feelings for her have faded, I still think about her from time to time, and every time I do, her name starts appearing again in random places.

- Just recently, while traveling in another country, I accidentally FaceTimed her. I wasn’t even using my FaceTime app—I was just holding my phone while waiting for Uber to load. My friend pointed out that I was calling her, and I have no idea how it happened.


Current Confusion
- I don’t know if she thinks about me at all or experiences anything similar.

- Spiritually, I feel like this connection is unfinished, like there’s something I’m meant to understand or resolve.

- I don’t necessarily want her in my life anymore, yet this constant reappearance of her name and these strange incidents make me wonder if there’s a deeper meaning.


Has anyone else experienced something similar? What could this mean from a spiritual perspective?

Didnt have great response and im in need of honest feedback about it and how to improve it.
Is the story so bad? Recap too vague? What about hashtag usage? Too short/ long of a thread?
Thanks so much in advance!
Heres the thread:

Say hello to Frankenstein, our town’s biggest and sweetest resident! This giant pup may have a monster of a name, but he’s got a soft spot for honey. Every evening after work, he sprawls across his trusty sofa, happily slurping up his favorite treat. 
(Hashtags: FrankensteinFido, HoneyLover)

When the workday ends, Frankenstein lumbers home to his favorite sofa—a creaky old thing that barely holds his bulk. With a jar of honey in paw, he scoops out a dollop, savoring every sticky lick like it’s pure gold. This big guy’s all about the simple pleasures!  
(Hashtag: StickyPaws)
  
Frankenstein’s world is turning upside down! The town’s honey supply is running low, and his precious stash is nearly gone. For a massive dog who relies on honey to unwind, this shortage feels like a personal attack. Something’s got to change!  
(Hashtags: HoneyHorror, BigDogBlues)
 
Not one to sit idly by, Frankenstein sets off for the police station, his enormous frame casting shadows as he goes. Passersby gawk at the sight of this “monster” on a mission, but he’s got one goal: save the honey supply!  
(Hashtag: HoneyQuest)
  
Officer Daniels nearly drops his coffee when Frankenstein barges into the station. “Honey trouble, huh?” he says with a grin, eyeing the dog’s hopeful face. Won over by those pleading eyes, he vows to help. Can Frankenstein save the day? To be continued!

I had let a couple months go between visits this time, but went in today. Upon seeing me, she had a happy look and a big smile on her face. 

I approached the counter and she said “Look who came back after all this time!  You look good, your hair is longer.” I told her yes, I was letting it grow. She then leaned in and point blank asked if I had a girlfriend. I said no and asked if she had a boyfriend. She said no and I asked why not. “I don’t want one, I’m enjoying my freedom.” She said. At this point, a line was forming behind me so I ordered my coffee and moved to the register to pay.  

When my coffee was ready, I took it to a table and scrolled my phone for a while. I had no interaction with her during this time because the place was getting busier.

When I finished my coffee, I went up to take my mug to the dirty bin and to say bye to her. She asked if I was going to be back later this week or next weekend. I told her I would try.

It clearly sounds like she’s interested, but why the remark about enjoying her freedom?

My name is Joakim Lloyd Raboff and I'm a legally blind visual artist and writer born and raised in Los Angeles but who has been living in Sweden and a few other places ever since leaving L.A. in the late 1970s. After the pandemic, I decided to cut back on my workload in order to write more and create a series of POD books with a wide range of themes. Though I've self-published a slew of other books over the years (offset printed books as opposed to digital book printing), I thoroughly enjoy publishing POD books. No blockbuster sales as of yet, but decent pocket change for sure.   
  
Here are a few examples of my POD books:

* **""L.A.: A Photographic Journey to the Urban Groove of Los Angeles""** This book captures the diverse landscapes and cultures of Los Angeles with an intimate look into the city's uniqueness. ​
* **""Silhouette Surfers""** A curated collection from my fine art project, this book delves into the world of surfing, presenting it through a unique visual narrative. ​
* **""The Aging Man's Survival Guide""** This is a guide that provides insights into male aging, addressing often under-discussed topics to help us men live our best lives after 60. ​
* **""New York City""** A decades-long project that culminated in a coffee table book about New York City, capturing the essence and vibrancy of the metropolis.

I have a backyard that is 3/4 acre with a camper trailer and a large farm gate access to the street, two blocks from the area she moves about  sleeping in different locations.  Her situation is very similar to the movie Ray, and the role Jamie Fox played.  No drug use I've ever had reason to suspect but tchronic tobacco use - she's told me it's the only thing that makes her cough and throat better.   If I push anything on her she's going to leave so I really just want to leave her be.   In her mind her entire life she's been chased by an evil being that kidnapped her as a baby, who has burned her alive, stabbed her,... He finds her when her name is set out loud and or when she touches metal or batteries.  It's her reality And I'm only offering her a place safe/warm from the horrible cold, wind, and rain.  The hard part is she's an intelligent, thoughtful, and delightful person when she's lucid and feels safe.  I'm sharing all this because I don't want anyone to think I don't really care about her because I'm not going to push her to go to the doctor.   I'm a younger woman and she's been on the street for a very long time.   Okay sorry for all of that here's my question... Because I could hear her outside last night, the weather is very cold and horribly windy..   I could hear her cough was very bad, I've heard it before, and having worked with military veterans going back all the way to world war II My guess is she is later stages COPD.   I want to offer her some relief and an over-the-counter and or natural form but I'm not sure even where to begin.  She has told me that smoking tobacco is the only thing that helps her with the cough and her sore throat.  I read that people with COPD should drink a lot of water but she probably doesn't because there are no public bathrooms anymore  and businesses only let paying customers use their bathrooms.  She does drink coffee so she might accept tea with honey..
Or those straws with honey in them maybe?  When I offered her something to eat or anything she needed before retiring to the main house she asked for four aspirin.  All I had were VA issued acetaminophen and naproxen both of which she politely declined.. she also said she cannot take ibuprofen after long-term use.  Are there any other over-the-counter medicines and or home remedies tried and true by people with COPD?  
Thank you so much for reading all this and for any suggestions you may have.  To be honest I'm  shocked she even came in my car and that she didn't leave last night which she actually might have but I just don't know yet.  *She only came in my car because she said that the times in the past she'd try to find my house it wasn't there, the street was different,  because everything was a different dimension.

We won’t even talk about 2 days later my horse injuring her eye which ended up being almost 5 months of constant care and 14k bill 😅 I drank myself stupid for about 2 weeks and ever since then have never made it past 3 days regardless of my efforts. Did I mention my one year of sobriety would have been July 5th of last year? Sigh. 

This past Thursday I drank an entire 6 pack and then drunkenly ordered more from a delivery service. I felt horrible Friday, and the lowest mentally ever yesterday. I cancelled a date with an ex of mine to purchase an expensive coffee and read for the evening. Usually I would have just succumbed to sadness and gotten a 6 pack but I didn’t want it. Today I woke up feeling amazing regardless of the rain and an antsy 10 month old Gordon setter pup. 

I found myself enjoying the morning, and took advantage of a break in rain to run some errands. I usually hate people and found myself interacting with them and just being overall…happy? The sun came out on the way home, which would usually be a signal to grab beer on a Sunday. Instead I’m making a fancy brunch for myself while I read and hope the weather stays nice so I can run my pup later. 

Has anyone else struggled in a short cycle and then just weirdly just not had any cravings? Even my thoughts are different. I’m sitting here in my head making plans for re-integrating lifting in the mornings which I haven’t done in 10 months and deciding on evenings to ride my horse again. 

I’m almost terrified to feel happy or hopeful because of how sudden these feelings happened. 

If you made it through this rambling novel of basically nothing, thank you 💜 hoping I can post here at a week of sobriety in a few days!

As someone who isn't a foreigner and doesn't have any metabolic diseases like diabetes, I am expected to participate! And it turns out that faking it may be worse than actually doing it >:(

All I want to do to be able to function at work (at which I'm ALREADY not doing well) is have a belly full of food. I need to be SATIATED. I need a beach ball of gut protruding from my otherwise gorgeous lean muscular frame for me to rub as I align fucking icons on a stupid ppt deck. I need to be surrounded by both the remains of eaten food as well as a number of yet to be eaten food options. I need FUEL!!!

And while it's excellent that I get to work remotely twice a week (in addition to being at home for the two day weekend), it just makes it that much harder to commit to the bit Because on the weekends and remote working days, all I can think of is that I'm not supposed to \_succumb to temptation\_ because I know I'm a creature of habit. And it takes consistently fasting for it to become easy. But I haven't been able to do it, so it hasn't gotten any easier! Aaarrghh.

Last year was easier because I didn't even try to do it; I would just eat before and after work. But this year I decided to actually fast, the way I used to when I believed in it - my last time participating was 10 or 11 years ago, when I was 22 or 23.

Turns out belief was a huge ingredient! Also just generally being a pampered kid who didn't \*need\* to do anything, and basically being in the habit of doing it all the time, not just during the special month.

I GUESS I learned from writing this out that I just need to start eating in the mornings again. I guess.

I mean, I haven't and will not can not stop drinking coffee in the mornings, which makes me drink water & pee a lot, which feels insanely revealing at work. Ain't nobody using the bathroom there but me. And the pretending! I'm usually one of those honesty freaks so this is difficult for me.

But it is time.

To embrace.

The dark side.

Just eat and use the bathroom unapologetically. It's fine.

Right after I thank my favorite coworker for the awesome ""ayah a day"" book she got for each of us.

(To commenters who say they might not notice: yeah, they might not. but also they might. I work in a very small office with less than 10 people. The bathroom is very hearable unfortunately. And it's a dead giveaway to someone like me, who's given it some thought because I'm a heretic. Plot twist: what if we're all secretly exbelievers who are lying about it! hahaha lmao I can tell we're not because they're really fasting! I can see it on them. Just like they can see the energy on me.

So what if they do notice? ... I don't know. I mean. Well. Huh.)

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, spring training—the time of year when baseball fans dust off their caps, players pretend to care about exhibition games, and we all try to remember the names of those promising rookies who will inevitably be traded for a bag of peanuts by midseason.

In this Grapefruit League showdown, the New York Mets will face off against the Houston Astros. It's a matchup that promises all the excitement of a lukewarm cup of coffee, but hey, it's baseball, and we love it anyway.

The Mets, with their high expectations and a roster that even Darryl Strawberry is excited about, are looking to fine-tune their lineup. They've got Clay Holmes, their Opening Day starter, ready to go, but not today against the Astros. Instead, they'll likely trot out a mix of prospects and veterans who are just trying to avoid injury before the real games begin.

On the other side, the Astros are the underdogs here, with odds hovering around 1.93 to 2.18 across various sportsbooks. Given that underdogs win about 41% of the time in baseball, there's a decent chance the Astros could pull off a surprise victory. After all, spring training is the land of unpredictability, where the rules are made up and the points don't matter.

For those looking to make a wager, the best bet might be to take the Astros at 2.18 with Bovada. It's a juicy price for a game where anything can happen, and let's face it, the Mets are known for their ability to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

So, grab your sunscreen, settle in with a hot dog, and enjoy the game. Just remember, it's spring training—where the stakes are low, but the potential for hilarity is high.",1,1742143556.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

I'm not a fan of backpacks as they're took bulky when I lie it flat in my lap and it's hard if I try to go shopping and is too bulky.

Any suggestions? I do like tote bags like the BAGGU because of how flexible it is and it zips closed and has an extra pocket for my wallet.",3,1742143472.0,handbags,6,1.0,False
1jcpo4f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jcpo4f,Family room layout help please,"Hi everyone!  I could use some help please :).  Just gutted the kitchen and family room.  Kitchen is done, but now I need to sort out rest of the space.  Attached photos show the space I’m focused and the finishes in the new kitchen.  All of the old furniture went to the dump so, I need to buy new stuff.  I have some questions please and would love to get suggestions and colors, etc.  Thanks!

1.  What color mantle and tiles should I use for the fireplace? Walls are Benjamin Moore Grey Cashmere. Cabinets are a coffee stain, tile is 3 x 12 Jade Glossy Renzo, countertops are Emerstone Borghini Gold and floors are VersaCore Grande 10 in Harvest.

2.  TV has to go on wall opposite the windows, or in a corner.  Is one preferable to another?

3.  My instinct is to not close off the space with a sofa facing the fireplace, so it will have to go in front of the windows.  Would a console table behind it be a good idea?

4.  I’d like to have comfy seating for at least 4 adults, perhaps with some additional seating that can be moved around?

I took a stab at a layout but I’m not sure how much space is needed between pieces, or what sizes, colors or finishes would be best.  I like the idea of keeping the flow fairly open but it’s not a ton of space.  I do have an antique mantle clock that I’d like to use, as well as a few marble tops tables and chests elsewhere in the house, but I think that they might be too heavy for in here.

So that’s my info.  I appreciate you taking time to look at this!  Thanks!

**Chapter 7: The Escape**

For days on end, John and Evan looked outside their prison cell window and waited and waited for a day with thunderstorms. Eventually, a thunderstorm came at 1:30 AM with lightning crashing down from the heavens onto Earth.

“I’ve got the 20-foot lightning rod made of antennas.” Evan said.

“I’ve got the jar of battery acid and the bicycle chains that are attached to car hood hooks as grappling hooks.” John said.

Evan looked down the hallway to see if there were any guards around, and there were no guards in their area.

“Coast is clear!” Evan loudly whispered to John.

Evan and John tiptoed towards the electrical closet room and Evan stuck the lightning rod made of antennas up through a small crack in the ceiling into the sky where rain came pouring down. John then wired that lightning rod into the central electrical control panel.

“Now we just have to wait for it to be struck by lightning so that the prison’s power goes out and we can hop over the electric fence.” Evan said.

Two hours later, John and Evan saw a lightning bolt come through the small crack in the ceiling traveling down the lightning rod made of antennas and into the central electrical control panel, shorting it out. All of the lights in the prison went dark, and they realized that they successfully shorted out the power in the prison.

“Hurry, power-walk this way towards the prison yard. Don’t run or you’ll draw attention to yourself and the guards will notice you. If someone notices us and tries to catch us, then switch from power-walking to running.” John instructed Evan.

John and Evan powerwalked about 500 feet from the electrical closet to the backdoor past a few security guards who were all asleep, which makes sense considering that it was 3:30 in the morning.

John and Evan walked through the empty prison yard lit by the moon to the first wall.

“We’ll both take turns using my grappling hook first to get past this first wall with the electric fence, and we’ll take turns using your grappling hook to get past the second with the barbed wire.” Evan directed John. 

“Really, why can’t each of us just use one grappling hook for both walls?” John asked.

“Because these grappling hooks are single-use because once you’ve used them to ascend and descend the walls, you would have to re-ascend the walls so you could retrieve the grappling hooks, and then jump off the wall to unhook it and retrieve it. This would be both time-consuming and dangerous because if you jump off of the walls incorrectly, you could break a bone.” Evan explained.

“Well shit, I guess you’re right,” John replied
Evan held onto the end of the bicycle chain that was not attached to the car hood hooks, and threw the bicycle chain into the air, causing the end attached to the car hood hooks to latch onto the top of the electric fence that was shorted out due to the power outage. Evan went first, climbing up the bicycle chain with all of his might. He almost slipped, but he made it up to the top.

“Now it’s your turn to climb up. Once we're both at the top, I will start climbing down, as neither of us can climb down until both of us have climbed up.” Evan explained

“And why is that?” John asked

“Because someone has to re-adjust the grappling hook for us to start lowering ourselves on the other side of this wall in a safe manner, and if I have already lowered myself by the time you start climbing up, then no one will be at the top to re-adjust the grappling hook.” Evan replied.

“Fair point.” John replied.

John, who was much stronger than Evan, used his strength to propel himself up the bicycle chain. The chain almost broke under John’s weight, but John made it to the top successfully. Once John and Evan both were at the top of the wall, Evan re-adjusted the grappling hook position so that it pointed down the other side of the wall, allowing Evan and John to descend the wall on the other side. Evan climbed down first, then John. 

“One wall down, one wall to go,” John said

“With this 2nd wall with the barbed wires, we will treat it exactly like the first but because of the barbed wires, I will pour this battery acid on it, which will make that part of the barbed wire deteriorate which will allow us to go through the barbed wire and escape,” Evan explained
John grabbed his bicycle chain on the end that was not attached to the car hood hook and threw the other end into the air, as it latched onto the top of the 2nd wall with the barbed wire. Evan then grabbed the jar filled with battery acid and shoved it into his back pocket and climbed up the bicycle chain to the top of the wall with the barbed wire. Evan got out the jar and poured the battery acid onto the barbed wire, which caused it to melt, creating a clear passageway for John and Evan. John then climbed up the chain with Evan. Evan then re-adjusted the chain for it to go down the other side of the wall and slowly descended it to the other side, finally making his way to the outside of the prison into freedom. John followed Evan down the chain and was now also on the outside of the prison. As the sun started to rise, Evan and John heard sirens activating in the prison, meaning that they knew they had fixed the damaged power system and that they knew that Evan and John had escaped.

“First things first, we will be too recognizable in our orange uniforms. There’s a dumpster filled with all kinds of clothes with only tiny holes in them in the garbage behind the clothing store over there. Let’s get some new clothes so we don’t get caught.” John said. 
Evan and John both went into the dumpster and got themselves new clothes with a few holes in them and threw out their old prison uniforms so that they would not get caught.

“Look over there!” John said “There's a boxcar with a homeless person riding in it. Maybe we can ride in it to get away from this prison so that we don’t get caught.” John said.

“Good idea,” Evan replied.

Evan and John ran towards the boxcar train with a homeless man on it and hopped on. As soon as they hopped on, the homeless man said 

“Looks like this is my stop.”And hopped off. 

The boxcar train whisked Evan and John hundreds of miles away.

**Chapter 8: The Breakup**

The boxcar train that was carrying John and Evan was now hundreds of miles away west of the prison in an abandoned wilderness.

“Ok, so now that we have escaped prison, what will we do next?” Evan asked.

“We’ll probably flee to Mexico where the tax laws are very loosely enforced and we can get away with not paying taxes and not going to prison.” John replied.

“But I don’t want to go to Mexico, I want to go to Canada where there is an enormous welfare state and I can easily get away with welfare fraud and not go to prison,” Evan complained. 

“Well, I’m sure as hell not going to Canada where I’d be forced to spend all of my hard-earned tax dollars on lazy bums like you!” John yelled.

“Did you just call me a lazy bum?!” Evan snapped back as he grabbed John’s shoulder.

“That’s exactly what you are, a lazy bum!” John snapped as he threw Evan to the floor inside the boxcar train. “You’ve never worked a day in your life and all you ever do is leech off of hard-working taxpayers like me to pay for your luxurious lifestyle while I get none of the luxuries you can get. That’s exactly why I stopped paying taxes 20 years ago!”

“Fine, I’m going to Canada by myself.” Evan declared.

“I’m going to Mexico by myself.” John declared.

The boxcar train then stopped at Millennium Park Station in Chicago with networks of trains and train tracks going every which way. John and Evan both parted ways, as John snuck onto the back of a train going south to Mexico, while Evan snuck onto the back of a train going north to Canada. 

**Chapter 9: Monotony**

Once Evan rode that train from Chicago to Toronto he got a job as a safety inspector at a nuclear power plant and bought a cheap apartment downtown. The next few weeks were a steady routine for Evan: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed:

and so on. 

Evan loved having a steady routine for once, as this was something he had never had before as a criminal who was always running from the law. In Canada, he got a steady job and never resorted to welfare fraud. One day Evan was watching the news when he heard a disturbing report.

“This just in, a man named John was kidnapped and brutally beaten by the infamous gang MS-13” John’s full name and face were shown across the TV screen and a video was shown of John being tortured.

“Good riddance!” Evan said to himself “That’s what he gets for not listening to me and going to Mexico instead. I hope your tax evasion scheme worked out well.”

A few more weeks went by when Evan was subject to the same old monotonous routine: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed: 

Go work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed.  

And so on and so on.
Evan started to hate the monotony of the routine he once loved. He realized just how boring life had become without someone to argue with like John. Evan then became so lonely without John or anyone else in his life that he found himself pacing around the floor at his lunch break talking to himself, and his coworkers started to get weirded out. 

“Sure, I might be bored and lonely, but am I going to risk life and limb just to save someone I love to hate?” Evan said to himself while he was pacing around the lunchroom floor.

“Evan, what the hell are you doing? You’ve been pacing around talking to yourself in public all lunch break? You seem lonely and you need a friend!” Rick, one of Evan’s coworkers, yelled at Evan while they were in the coffee break room at the nuclear power plant. 

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!” 

Rick's words rang in Evan’s ears over and over again.

“A friend eh?” Evan said to himself. “I think I know just where one is in Tijuana, Mexico who just so happens to need my help.”

Evan sprinted out the door toward the parking lot

“What are you doing this time!?” Rick asked

“Risking my life to save someone I hate for reasons I don’t quite understand. Gotta go!” 

Evan yelled back at Rick as he sprinted out the door. He ran over to the nearby train station where he booked a ticket to Tijuana.

“Time to fight a drug cartel and kick ass!” Evan whispered to himself as he boarded the train to Tijuana.

**Chapter 10 Evan frees John**

The train got off in Tijuana in a train station in a sketchy ally with city maps for both English and Spanish telling tourists where various attractions and shops are, and one of them was a gun shop, which would allow Evan to get his hand on a weapon so he could take down MS-13 and save John. 
“Why is a gun shop one of the primary tourist destinations listed on the map?” Evan thought to himself out loud

“Mexico has very loose gun laws unlike Canada and the US, so people from across the border in San Diego cross the border all the time just to get guns.” a tourist responded to Evan.

“Oh, you speak English?” Evan asked.

“Yeah, virtually everyone in Tijuana speaks both English and Spanish,” the tourist responded.

Evan then found a currency exchange station where he exchanged his Canadian dollars for Mexican pesos. Evan then walked a few blocks to the nearby gun shop where he purchased a gun and some ammo to take down MS-13 to save his friend. As soon as he started to wonder how he could find MS-13, he saw a guy with a large MS-13 tattoo and asked him if he could join MS-13 as a new member.

“That’s a talk between you and the leader. I will take you to him, but to join MS-13, you first must prove your loyalty to him.” The guy with the MS-13 tattoo explained. 

Evan followed him through a maze of complex allies, each one sketchier than the last, into an enormous run-down warehouse-looking building with a 10-foot pyramid structure in the center, and at the top of the pyramid was a golden chair with a fat man sitting in it.

“Why have you come to bother me?!” the fat man snapped.

“We have a new potential recruit to MS-13.” the guy with the MS-13 tattoo replied.

“Hmmmmm, that’s odd, we haven’t had a recruit in several years. Well, I guess we could always use more members.” the fat man said to himself “Your loyalty test to this organization will be that you are required to assassinate Tijuana city council member Luis Francheco and have his corpse brought to me. He is the primary member of the Tijuana city council who is trying to push corruption out of the Tijuana city government and we rely on that corruption so that we can continue to bribe the government officials so that they don’t arrest us. Do you understand?”

“Yes sir,” Evan replied. “Do you by chance happen to know where you guys keep your prisoners?” 

“That is confidential information that I can not tell you until you have brought Luis Francheso’s corpse to me.” The fat man replied.

“Understood.” Evan replied.

Evan walked out of the MS-13 layer and walked a few blocks until he saw an ally where he could buy some roofies. Evan then ran his next errand to a local grocery store where he purchased a big bottle of wine and a pen and a thank you card where he wrote “Thank you Mr. Franchesco for being the best city council member, we have a gift for you in the form of a bottle of wine.” Once Evan was out of the store, he opened the bottle of wine and opened the package of roofies and dumped the roofies into the wine bottle. Last but not least, Evan got on a bus and went to the outskirts of town where he saw a farm. He snuck onto that farm and slaughtered one of the pigs and emptied the blood from the pig’s carcass into the same jar he used to carry the battery acid during their escape from prison. Evan then rode the bus to city hall and went into Mr. Franchesco’s office and put the thank you card and the bottle of wine on his desk. Evan then heard Mr. Franchesco’s footsteps down the hallway approaching his room at the end of the hallway, so Evan hid in the closet in Mr. Franchesco’s office and peeped through the ventilation desk to see Mr. Francesco sit down in his office chair.

“Oh Boy!” Mr. Franchesco said to himself “Someone’s left a big bottle of wine and a thank you card for me. I normally don’t drink at work, but it’s 4 pm, so I guess we can make an exception here. Plus it’s been a long stressful day for me. “Juan, my assistant, can you take a sip of this wine for me please so that I don’t get poisoned?.. Oh, I forgot, he’s out sick today.”

Evan quietly breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing that Mr. Franchesco’s taster assistant was out sick today, and Mr. Francesco took a sip of the wine and instantly passed out. Evan then looked in the hallways to see that no one was coming, and he saw that no one was there, so Evan dragged Mr. Franchesco’s unconscious body out the door. Once he was out the door, Evan dumped the vile of pig blood all over Mr. Franchesco’s dead body to make it look like he killed him. Evan then used all of his strength to drag Mr. Franchesco’s body to the MS-13 lay and present it below the fat man who led MS-13. 

“Excellent work.” the fat man said to Evan. “You are officially now our newest member.”

“So where exactly does MS-13 keep their prisoners?”

“We keep them at 4-303 Bolivar Rd. When you get out of the warehouse, you make a right out of the driveway onto our street and go down it 6 blocks and then you make a left onto Bolivar Road. You will then go down 3 and a half more blocks and you will come across 4-303 bolivar road on your left. I am granting you this MS-13 badge. Just show the guards this badge and they will let you in. May I ask why do you want to go into our gang prison?” The fat man replied.

“Because there’s this guy in there named John who I am going to shoot with my pistol because he’s behind on his mortgage to me. I lent him a car, and he has now been behind on his monthly payments for 6 months in a row, so I’m going to show him why you don’t mess with me” Evan responded.
“Well, we hate John too. We only captured him in the hope that we could hold him ransom for the US government, and because they have refused to buy him from us, he’s essentially a useless prisoner who you are free to kill.” The fat man replied. 

John walked 6 blocks, turned left at Bolivar Road, walked 3 and a half blocks more, and found 4-303 Bolivar Road and opened the door to get in. Once he opened that door, there was a short hallway with a door at the end with two more guards who both had guns both pointed at Evan and announced.

“Halt! Please show us your ID and your purpose for the entry” 

“I have been sent here to kill prisoner John,” Evan announced. “The boss ordered for him to be killed because we were unable to sell him for ransom back to the US government. Here is my ID.” Evan showed him the badge

“Your entry is granted!” the guards stepped out of the way and withdrew their guns. “Here is the key to Evan’s cell.”

 Evan then walked through the maze of cells filled with prisoners who were beaten, bloodied, and battered, until he came across the one he was here for. He approached John’s cell and unlocked it.

“Evan?” John asked, with blood pouring out of wounds on his torso and arms

“Yes, it’s me, Evan,” Evan replied. “I’m here to set you free.”

Evan and John then both ran out of the prison, with Evan using his gun to shoot both of the prison guards in the knee and freeing John from the torture of the MS-13 prison. 

“I can't believe you risked your life to save me?!” John said as he hugged Evan and cried

“Shhhh!” Evan whispered loudly “We have to be quiet and remain out of sight. MS-13 could send out reinforcements anytime.

As John and Evan ran through the city of Tijuana towards the train station, they passed by this electronic store with an enormous glass window with multiple TVs in the store showing through the glass onto the streets where people could watch the TVs. One of those TVs in the electronics store showing on the street had the news on, and it showed that the President of the United States’s 13-year-old daughter had been kidnapped by a gang called the Tijuana Cartel and that the president was offering a reward of a million dollars to whoever could rescue the president’s daughter.

“Are you thinking what I am thinking?” John asked Evan
“That we could get a million dollars from saving the President’s daughter from the Tijuana Cartel?” Evan replied.

“Better yet, we could get a presidential pardon for our crimes if we save the president’s daughter from the Tijuana Cartel and get our criminal records expunged.” John replied

“Good idea.” Evan replied.

“Freeze” John and Evan both heard as five gunmen and a leader approached John and Evan at the electronics store with the TVs that showed out into the streets and were about to shoot them then and there. 

“Do you have any last words before MS-13 kills you?” The leader of the gunman asked.
 Evan pulled out his gun to try to shoot them in self-defense, but it was no use as Evan was out of ammo and at the mercy of the five MS-13 gunmen.

“Thanks for saving my life by rescuing me from the MS-13 prison. John said to Evan “Even if it only extended my life for five more minutes.”

“Be prepared to die!” the leader of the gunman said as the five gunmen all cocked their guns and aimed at Evan and John, as they flinched, knowing that this would be the end. The five gunmen all had their fingers on the triggers about to shoot and end Evan and John’s life when suddenly the five gunmen and their leader all fell and had bullet-holes in their torsos with blood oozing out on the sidewalk at the Electronic store with the TVs pointing out to the streets. 

“Whoever you are, thank you for saving our lives.” Evan and John said.

“Call me Enedina, the leader of the Tijuana Cartel.” A woman stepped out of a shadowy ally with smoke coming out of her AR-15. “MS-13 has been one of our biggest rivals in the gang war, and your escape has certainly made headlines in the news of the criminal underworld, and for publicly slapping the face of our biggest rival, we want to make you the newest member of the Tijuana Cartel.

“Hold on, I need to have one moment alone with my associate,” Evan said

“Take your time,” Enedina said

“John, is this the same Tijuana Cartel that has kidnapped the President’s daughter?” Evan whispered to John.

“It sure is.” John replied, whispering to Evan. 

“Ok, so we will join and then free the president’s daughter.” Evan replied whispering to John.
“We will join the Tijuana Cartel with you.” Evan and John said to Enedina.

“It’s always good to have two new members,” Enedina replied.

**Chapter 11: a presidential pardon**

John and Evan were welcomed into the layer of the Tijuana Cartel, and they asked Enedina if they could have some more bandages for John’s wounds and ammo for Evan’s gun and Enedina happily provided those to them. 

“Enedina, would you know where we keep the Tijuana Cartel gang prisoners?” John asked

“We keep them at 3-506 Zaragoza Road. You have to first get a right out of the driveway and then go down the street for 4 blocks and make a left onto Zaragoza Road. You go down the road for about half a block and you will see 3-506 Zaragoza on your right. May I ask why you want to go down to where the prisoners are kept?” Enedina replied.

“We were looking to kill the President of the United State’s daughter. We have fed her for days, yet the president still shows no sign of paying her ransom or doing anything, so we have no other choice but to kill her as she means nothing to us now.” Evan replied.

“Yeah, you have a fair point. I see no reason why the president’s daughter needs to live. We’ve broadcasted her face all over the news for days and everyone knows that she has been kidnapped and if the president wanted to save her or pay her ransom, he would have easily done that by now. I permit you to go kill the president’s daughter in her jail cell. Here’s a Tijuana Cartel badge. Present this badge to the guards outside and they should let you into the President’s daughter’s cell. 

John and Evan took a right out of the driveway and walked 4 blocks, turned left, walked another half block, and came across 3-506 Zaragoza Road. They opened the door and then walked into a very short 5-foot-long hallway with another door at the end with two guards with guns both pointed at them.

“Halt!” The guards shouted “Show us your authorization and purpose for the entry.”

“We are with the Tijuana Cartel and we have been sent here to kill the President’s daughter, as we have held her for ransom for days, and yet the president has done nothing to save her or pay her ransom, so we have decided that the best use of resources is to simply kill her so we don’t waste our resources feeding her.” John stated.

“Here is our Tijuana Cartel badge handed to us by Enedina.” Evan stated.
 
“You are free to enter our prison, here’s the key to the president’s daughter’s cell.” The guards stated.

John and Evan walked through the Tijuana Cartel Prison with prisoners in every shade of orange, each one looking scarier than the last until they came across the sweet-looking face of the president’s 13-year-old daughter. John unlocked the key while Evan entered the cell and leaned into the president’s daughter’s ear and whispered that they were there to save her life.

“Yippie!” the President’s daughter shouted.

“Shhhhh!” Evan whispered loudly.

 Evan and the President’s daughter exited the cell and joined up with John who was outside of the cell. John, Evan, and the President’s daughter all walked swiftly but calmly towards the entrance they came in, as Evan got out his gun and shot the guards in the knees before they could suspect anything, meaning that John and Evan had now just freed the President’s daughter. The trio then started running away from the prison northward towards the US border.

“Next stop, to San Diego across the border,” Evan said panting while running. “I brought a makeshift grappling hook made of bicycle chains and a car hood that we can use to hop the Tortilla wall that separates Tijuana and San Diego.”

“Ugh, do we have to use one of those? Last time I used one of those I almost fell off of the prison . . . I mean a city wall.” John coughed and awkwardly corrected himself as he noticed the president’s 13-year-old daughter look at him as he slipped up and said he escaped from prison.

“Wait, you two are outlaws?” The president’s daughter asked John and Evan.

“*sigh* yes,” John and Evan said in unison as the trio all continued to pant in unison as they were running towards the border while talking.

“Awesome!” the president’s daughter squealed. “I've always wanted to meet an outlaw, but my dad won’t let me walk outside without secret service supervision and engage in any fun activities that kids my age do like spray painting and skateboarding.”

The trio continued to run and they were less than a block away from the Tortilla wall at the US-Mexico border when 6 men with guns all blocked the street in front of them and pointed their guns at the trio and said

“Freeze, we have orders to terminate you by the Tijuana Cartel!”

Evan once again reached for his pistol and tried to fire it, but it was jammed and unable to fire. John, Evan, and The President’s daughter all cowered there helplessly in fear and saw their entire life flash before their eyes, and time stood still, knowing that the gun of the Tijuana Cartel was about to end their very lives within the flash of a second.

“On my command fire,” Their leader shouted. 

The 6 gunmen all cocked their guns and aimed at the trio, when all of a sudden, two attack helicopters with American flags came out of the air and shot all 6 gunmen, and all 6 fell with bullet holes in their torsos and blood oozing out on the sidewalk less than a block away from the Tortilla wall. After the two attack helicopters shot down the 6 gunmen, Airforce One descended onto the ground in front of the trio. The president opened the door to the plane and the stairs descended to the sidewalk where John, Evan, and the president’s daughter were all standing.

“Hop on in honey!” The president announced “Who are your two new friends”

“They just saved me from prison in the Tijuana Cartel by pretending to join the organization and then double-crossing them to save me.” The president’s daughter explained. “Can they come too?”

The president stood there for a long moment, seeing that these guys were sketchy and looked like convicts themselves, the president would normally let these types of guys into his plane, but considering that they had just saved his daughter, he reluctantly agreed to let them in. The trio climbed into Air Force One, and Airforce One took off towards Washington DC.

“Before I say anything else, I just want to say that I am incredibly sorry that I didn’t come and save you earlier and that you were captured for over a week.” The president went on. “You see when I first got to Tijuana to have a meeting with the President of Mexico, I received anonymous death threats, so I was ordered by my secret service to abandon my meeting in Mexico and to flee to an undisclosed location in Nevada that had no cell signal, broadband, or internet for my safety so I had no way of knowing that you were captured. Before I left Tijuana for the undisclosed place in Nevada, I decided that for your safety, it would be best for you to stay behind in Tijuana with my presidential aide named Edwin, as I knew that keeping you with me in New Mexico would put you in more danger as I am the one they are after not you. If I had known that Edwin was such a heavy sleeper and wouldn’t detect kidnappers breaking into the house in the middle of the night, I would have never assigned him to protect you and I would have assigned someone else to protect you instead. I only found out that you had been captured once the secret service traveled to my undisclosed place in Nevada by car and informed me that you had been captured.” The president explained.

“It doesn’t matter now.” The president’s daughter said “What matters is that you and I are safe and together” as they both hugged and embraced, as a tear fell on both of their cheeks
. 
“And you two” the president motioned towards Evan and John “What made you two risk your life to save my daughter.”
Evan told his story about how he is a far-left activist who was arrested for welfare fraud, befriended his assigned cellmate who was a far-right activist who was arrested for tax evasion, and how they worked together to Escape prison. Then Evan went on to describe how they both planned to flee the country and for Canada, but then John and Evan got into a fight when they got out of prison and John went to Mexico while Evan went to Canada, and Evan found out that John had been captured while watching the news, so Evan went down to Mexico to save his friend. While they were in Mexico, they both saw the news about how the President of the United States’s daughter had been kidnapped, and they both agreed to break her out to receive a presidential pardon for their crimes. 

“A welfare queen and a tax evader working together?! That’s odd.” The president responded. “If only I could get along with members on the opposite side of the aisle in Congress as you do.” The president chuckled.

“Would you grant us a pardon?” John asked, “We have been through hell and back just to get to here, and we saved your daughter from death and we promise that we won’t do it again after having been on the run from the law for several months which taught us our lesson.”

“Normally, I would say no, but because of your heroism in risking your life to save my daughter from death, I will agree to grant you a full presidential pardon for your crimes, but be warned however, this pardon does not protect you from future crimes that you commit, so you can’t abuse the welfare system anymore and you can’t evade taxes anymore.” The president said.

“We promise we’ll be good from now on!” John and Evan said.

“This might be a weird request for you guys, but how would you two like to work at an entry-level job in the FBI for me? Our FBI has currently been ineffective at catching criminals, and I think the reason why they are is that none of them are ex-criminals, meaning they know nothing about how a criminal thinks or behaves, so we were wondering if you would like to take on a job in the FBI hunting these guys down?”

“That sounds good!” John squealed.

“Having a steady job for once in my life would mean that I would no longer have to resort to a life of crime” Evan cheered. 

“Thank you, Mr. President!” John and Evan said.

“You’re welcome.” The president replied.

Air Force One had just touched down in Washington DC, and John, Evan, and the President’s daughter all decided that they would get motorcycles, matching switchblades, and matching tattoos that read “Kill all betrayers” (although the President’s daughter’s was a temporary tattoo, as she wasn’t old enough to get a real one.) The president then approached John, Evan, and the President’s daughter with their matching motorcycles, tattoos, and switchblades, looking at his daughter with disgust for her new punk lifestyle.

“Honey, would you like to come with your dad on a cool diplomatic trip in Wilmington Delaware? There would be lots of tall chairs for you to sit in.” The president bribed his daughter.

“No thanks. I’m tired of going on trips that involve people in itchy clothing bitching at each other. I’d rather hang out with my cool new friends John and Evan!” The president’s daughter replied as she mounted on her motorcycle, as John and Evan each mounted onto their own.

“Well, you three have fun while I’m gone!” The president shouted as the three of them raced away on their motorcycles. 

“Secret service, follow them at a distance!” The president whispered to his secret service agents who proceeded to get in their motorcycles and follow them at a distance.

This vision of a sink came to me when I was doing my usual routine of emptying out my coffee grounds from my french press, and doing the regular motion of having to swish water around the sink with the press itself. It was here where I realized my vision of a sink whose design would intuitively allow for this to happen, rather than have me work against its inherent design.

He’s not super duper active generally, but he’s really bummed that he won’t be able to do his 1-2 times a week disc golfing with his buddies or roughhouse and take walks with the dog. He’s never broken a bone or been incapacitated before, so for the first time to be in his mid 40s is throwing him for a loop and he’s stubborn anyway, so the next 2 months are going to be hard and I worry about additional mental strain when he’s already probably got some midlife crisis issues going that he refuses to admit. 

He knows he’s going to be frustrated at work because he never stops moving there (maintenance). He can’t drive, and he likes going out taking drives with the dog and getting coffee. He’s bummed because he can’t even drive home to get lunch every day, and there’s not really a convenient fridge at work to keep stuff, especially because he doesn’t eat bread/carbs much. Just moving from the couch/bed to the kitchen/bathroom is difficult, and he’s so stubborn that he won’t really let me help him (so of course I feel helpless myself as a wife). He’s got crutches and one of those single knee crutch things so he can use his hands (he’s in a boot), but it takes a while to get it strapped on comfortably, and he can’t sit or lay with it on, so taking it on and off is a PITA. 

I’ve also never broken anything as an adult, so I don’t know how to best support him right now, especially because I’m also having some hard times physically and emotionally because perimenopause is hitting me hard right now, and I’m also going through some work stress/transition (also having to take a t-break from my medical cannabis that I use for anxiety and sleep due to needing to apply for new jobs in the next 30-45 days).

Listen, they're cool, they look trendy, but there are so many things wrong with this machine. No, I don't mean mechanically, it's been working great for two years, but let me take you down the road of my daily frustrations. 

  
For the price it costs, you'd think this machine would be a little smarter. It has no water level window, so you never really know how much water is in it. But then surely it has an internal water level detector, right? **WRONG.** The machine will happily start brewing a cup with 20mL of water then stop midway and tell you that it's out of water. So you add water, and it should pick up from where it left off, right? **WRONG AGAIN!** You gotta start over. Beans wasted, cup overflowing, and time wasted. 



So ya, would not recommend. For the price, I expect a little more brains. And, SMEG, if you don't want to incorporate brains, put a freaking water level window so that I know before I hit GO.

I used to kind of enjoy working as an associate, it’s not what i want to do with my life, but it was a decent job and I felt that I had a good manager. Been working for tkmaxx (cause i’m in the UK) since june 2024 and he offered me a better contract with more hours in August and said I was good at my job gave me lots of positive feedback etc. Unfortunately at the beginning of this year my nice manager left and everything has all gone really weird at work, my remaining managers have been what feels like bullying me and holding a disciplinary
over my head, although i’m really hesitant to call it bullying. I’m just not sure what to do, though i can’t leave until i get another job because ofcourse I need money :,)

about a month and a half ago I made a post on this same anonymous account saying that I got pulled into the office and told off at work for not displaying enough “pace and urgency” when I was struggling with heavy periods and could not stand upright from the pain. I had explained this while in tears to my manager but they didn’t seem to care lol.

About a week after that, I got called into the office and shouted at by another store manager because my shift had finished (in fact it was 10 minutes past my shift finishing) and I had plans with my boyfriend so couldn’t stay on the registers to help get the queue down. I’m aware that we were working on a skeleton crew, but that’s not MY fault, I’ve stayed late plenty of times and clocked in early when they asked, but this one time I did put my foot down and told them I had plans so I couldn’t do overtime. My manager proceeded to berate and shout at me that if my plans weren’t something “really important like a medical appointment” then i should’ve stayed late and “been a team player” and “having plans with your boyfriend isn’t a good enough excuse”. Ever since then I do feel like i’ve had a target on my back which is ridiculous. 

I’ve just been constantly watched like a hawk by store managers and criticised nonstop this past month or so. They completely ignore or blank me when I say hello, how are you etc, and only talk to me to criticise me. I got told off for being too quiet and not making an effort to ask questions and communicate with my supervisors? Then when i DO ask questions to double check i’m doing the right thing I get told “you should know this by now”. I honestly can’t do anything right and it’s making me feel physically sick to go into work. My colleagues are fine, but management clearly has a problem with me, and I could report it but to some extent I feel that HR is there to protect the company and so reporting it will put an even bigger target on my back :(

I had my yearly review last week and got threatened with a disciplinary for not displaying pace and urgency 2x at work (one of those instances was the time where I was feeling really ill due to do endometriosis, the second time I wasn’t able to complete a task my supervisor set due to being on registers for like 90% of my shift…..) and for refusing to stay late ONCE, which i have already written about.

I just hate them so much for this, I’m stressed beyond belief about going into work. I feel that i haven’t done anything that’s worthy of a disciplinary and I’m constantly treated like dirt by childish managers who only talk to me to make passive aggressive comments or tell me how slow i am. Meanwhile they spend the whole day in the office with the heating on high playing on their phones and drinking coffee. What an absolute joke. I want to quit more than anything but I do need money and i’m not sure if it’s worth reporting in the meantime. Just not sure what to do. I feel like I’m going to end up snapping and saying something I regret, because I can’t take much more of this ",7,1742142656.0,TjMaxx,2,1.0,False

>Romantic relationships significantly impact personal well-being, yet many relationships fail. Compatibility—how well two people “fit” together—is key for relationship success. Research indicates that similarity in attitudes and personality increases compatibility, leading to smoother, more positive interactions.

>Assessing compatibility requires individuals to have a clear understanding of their own personal attributes to effectively judge self-other “fit.” Researchers Dita Kubin and colleagues investigated whether individuals with lower self-concept clarity (SCC), a measure of how clearly and confidently people understand themselves, are less effective at using similarity information when evaluating potential romantic partners.

>Across all four studies, the results consistently showed that people with lower self-concept clarity evaluated less similar potential partners more positively than those with higher SCC. This suggests that individuals with an unclear sense of self were less discriminating when evaluating potential romantic partners, particularly when the profile showed moderate or low similarity.

*Know Thyself* is important while dating, taking time to grow and learn not only enhances your life, it improves your ability to vet men. Since men lack empathy and have an inflated sense of self, this explains men wanting *anyone*, not *someone*. They are carpal tunneling their way out of the dating market, arriving safely at their loneliness pandemic. These men, lacking in social skills, are offering up their number (or demanding yours), trying to fill their calendar with walk and coffee dates (no gold diggers), and are sure it is women that are superficial with too high of standards (although it is men only messaging the most attractive matches). 

By vetting ruthlessly (you should follow The Burned Haystack Dating Method) you are saving yourself time. That man who cannot string two sentences together (or ask a question, show interest in you...) and has a serial killer selfies is not going to show up for a coveted (/s) walk date and be the man of your dreams, you are going to waste your own time and burn out quickly. You don't have to give him a chance for any reason. No need to redirect if he gets sexual, no need to Nancy Drew his traumatic past, take him as he is, without those rose colored glasses. The good you see in him is you, the great conversations are you and the fun dates are you. 

If you could imagine that your time and energy are worth hundreds of dollar an hour (always round up) you will stop wasting your breath on men who will never shows up in a healthy manner. This takes time, it took me crashing and burning many times to be here, wiser and more appreciative of all that I offer.

Before getting to the recent events, let me give some context. We entered 2024 together, celebrating New Year's at my place with friends. That night, despite feeling a moment of closeness, I refrained from taking things further because I was interested in someone else at the time. Even though we were drunk, I made sure she was comfortable and let her sleep in my bed while I slept on the couch.

For the next month, I felt like she was hoping for a real relationship, but I kept my distance since my mind was elsewhere. I avoided being alone with her and declined any plans she suggested. Eventually, at a friend's birthday party, we got drunk and ended up getting close again. However, her best friend took her away.

The next day, I asked her to grab coffee because I wanted to end things properly, feeling that this undefined relationship was hurting both of us. She said she wasn’t available that day and that we could do it another time—but she never reached out again. Neither did I. We didn’t talk for 10 months.

Then, one night in December 2024, she messaged me, saying she regretted how things ended and wanted me back in her life. We met up that week, but I felt nothing. I couldn’t see myself loving her again, and I was still angry at how she had treated me. When I dropped her off, she told me our relationship would go in whatever direction I wanted.

For the next two weeks, we barely talked. Then, I invited her to an event hosted by a university club my friend was leading. My plan was to spend one last night together and end things for good. However, I was so bored at the event that I distanced myself from everyone, took my laptop from my car, and started studying at the bar. At one point, I told her we could leave whenever she wanted, but I told her we needed to head out early because I wanted to talk to her.

About 30 minutes later, we left, and when we got to her place, I told her I didn’t want to stay friends anymore. She agreed, saying she understood. I expected her to get out of the car, but she didn’t. Instead, I opened up about my feelings for her over the past 3.5 years. In the middle of my speech, she started crying and said she had something to say as well. When I finished, she admitted she had feelings for me too, on and off, over the years. After we talked, we both laughed and sat in silence. Then, she said she still wanted to try. Because of everything we had been through, I told her I’d think about it.

We started talking again, and for a month, we flirted. But I was about to leave the country in February for an exchange program. I wanted to know if she was sure about doing long distance and if she really loved me. A week before my departure, I told her we needed to talk. She assured me she was sure and that she would wait for me. I told her I wanted to be in a relationship, and we had an amazing last week together.

The first three weeks after I moved went fine, though our conversations became less frequent. Then, suddenly, she started making excuses—saying she was busy with school or friends. She took three hours to reply to messages. That Sunday, I asked if something was wrong. She said she wasn’t feeling well and that we should talk the next day.

On Monday, she told me she wasn’t satisfied with our communication and broke up with me. I was so shocked I felt like I had left my body. Still, I tried to reason with her, saying this was our first issue, that we had never even fought before, and that we could work through it. She insisted she didn’t want to change me. I told her she wasn’t changing me, but she wouldn’t listen. Finally, I said if she had already made up her mind, there was nothing left to say, and I hung up.

I thought I would cry, but instead, I was furious. She claimed to love me but disrespected both me and our relationship. It’s been a week, and I keep thinking about her. Some days, I feel fine; other days, I want to get back together. What do you think happened?

Additionally, I will be going to my home country next week for a week. Do you have any suggestions about what I should do?",1,1742142052.0,relationship_advice,2,0.67,False

I’ll definitely ask when I go in to the shop. I was just curious if there is a general tendency in how coffee shops serve espresso from other folks’ experience (since I’m very new to this - I didn’t even start drinking coffee until I was well into adulthood but fell in love with lattes).

1jcp3lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/greatwolflodge/comments/1jcp3lt/we_had_so_much_fun_some_tips_for_those_looking/,We had so much fun! Some tips for those looking.,"We went to the Fitchburg location on Friday, March 14, 2025. We got there right around 10 AM and went straight for the front desk where we checked in and got our bracelets. 

1. Make sure you look for any text from them before you arrive as you may get a deal to upgrade your room. We were able to upgrade to a kids cabin from a regular room for only $65. This was great because we also had a wolf den room and we were able to be close together with others in our group. These are on the other side of the resort so something to keep in mind if you’re booking these types of rooms and a room with two queen beds only.

2. Get the room with the bunkbeds if you can our kids (6 & 3) were obsessed with their bunk room. Just make sure everyone is extra careful because we all bumped our heads a lot lol.

3. We had the controversial question of whether or not we should get a cabana. I’m grateful somebody else within. Our group suggested it and we split the cost by 3. When you walk in to the main part of the waterpark, it is very overstimulating. Having the cabana made it so that we could go into our little oasis and have a little bit of distance from the crowds. The cabana came with a mini fridge with four water bottles,  a safe, two chairs with a table, a sectional like couch and a coffee table. Right outside the cabana there were two lounge chairs. We also had a server who was dedicated to the cabanas. This made it so we could just easily text them to order our food and they brought it to us when it was ready. It was awesome not to have to wait in line for food. You could also order drink drinks from the bar if you wanted. I saw most people say the cabana was not worth it, even the one person most resistant due to the cost was super grateful that we chose to rent one. Something to keep in mind is to do it in advance as all of the cabanas were booked for the day. We did not rent the cabana on day two because we are going to just go for a short time in the morning.

3. The food. We went to the buffet for dinner right when they opened at 5 PM. Our server mentioned that they had just recently switched over to an Italian buffet. Honestly, it was pretty good. It was a buffet so it’s not the most gourmet food in the world, but we really enjoyed it. Kids three and under are free which was great because my youngest wasn’t hungry after eating snack snacks all day.

4. We did build a bear because I anticipated my daughter, seeing the shop and knowing exactly what it was. My biggest regret was that I did not buy a pup pass because we did end up doing a lot of the activities included in the pass and paying full price. The employees at the build a bear were incredible and our kids loved every second of it. 

5. Storytime in the lobby was a hit and my girls loved it. The employees do such a great job of making it interactive and enjoyable. Their energy was wonderful.

6. The bubble party. This is when my wallet really started to hurt. You would think a bubble party how fun and you’d probably assume the bubbles were provided by Great Wolf Lodge, that was not the case. They wheeled out a cart with all of these bubble wands for sale ranging from $30-$35. My kids saw it and instantly I knew I was going to have to make another purchase. I anticipated things like this and did purchase it for them and they had a blast. I would have preferred not to spend $70 on bubble wands lol.

7. Something I didn’t know in advance as you can go into the gift shop and get your wolf ear headbands. Don’t forget to do this. I only knew it was possible because somebody walked in when I was waiting to pay and ask for their ears, so I inquired how it works.

8. The arcade was a great time for both kids and adults. Most of the games cost quite a bit of money, but it was worth it for the fun we had. 

9. The adults ended up getting ice cream by the arcade around 9 PM. It was okay, the prices really weren’t that bad but they were out of most ingredients at that point in the day.

10. For breakfast, we got coffee and donuts from the Dunkin’ Donuts self serve areas. Again, pricing wasn’t too bad.

11. When you stay the night there you get to arrive at the waterpark at 9 AM before the general public at 10 AM. We had no problem finding chairs for our group. It was very nice getting time there before it got very busy. The guys in our group packed up the rooms and the car while we took the kids to the waterpark. We were ready to go by 11 AM because it got extremely busy since it was a Saturday morning.

Overall, we had an incredible time. I was expecting to spend a lot more money than I actually did so it wasn’t bad at all. The memories my children made were completely worth it and we can’t wait to go back. We are thinking about trying the location at Foxwoods once it opens later this year.  I was excited to make this post as I didn’t exactly know what to expect when we were going, and I hope this helps others before their trip!",2,1742141955.0,greatwolflodge,0,0.75,False

Third date was wild - he got drunk and invited me to a darkroom where I ended up being grabbed without my consent (but that's on me, I didn't really read the room and understand how the darkroom etiquette works loll) and being openly proposed group sex by multiple people that knew I had never done anything yet (I had already met these people in the same club during my first date, and apparently word got out). 

This made me uncomfortable and I was so freaked out I ran home. But I realise it's totally my fault. I'm a very boring person and honestly I just want someone to snuggle up with under a blankie and chat. The thought of it makes me feel safe and comfortable and warm and that's what I want to feel in life after a decade plus of instability and depression to the point of having constant s_icidal thoughts. I also know that part of it is my internalised homophobia talking - I spent my life thinking any gay sex act was ""wrong"" and seeing people openly, proudly and freely living their sexuality just triggers an instinctive panicky and slightly judgemental response; you know the prissy old lady who clutches her pearls at the sight of two gay men kissing in drag? Yeah that's kind of what I am. Ultimately deep down I am terrified that OMG if I relax and accept myself I will become one of *those* one day. And I am GENUINELY trying to get over myself and grow and accept myself and others, but I still feel that I'm just too boring to really be able to find someone. I feel I will always run into the ""wild party with open sex"" wall which I cannot seem to truly vibe with.",5,1742141898.0,AskGaybrosOver30,9,0.86,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(28+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/ogCNVId)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! If you could live as any type of animal for one day, what would you choose?

I became a teacher and realized how many parents either don’t do a damn thing, or act like you’re a monster if you show that you’re not happy with them for even one second. Or hell, if you POLITELY point out a rule.

It wasn’t until I was an adult I realized the patterns my mom ingrained in me. Emotionally abusive narcissist who thinks I’m the cause of her misery. I don’t want other people having that happen to them, but it IS miserable for me when I see parents swooping in when they’re inconvenienced for 1 second. My mom was willing to spend a whole day reminding me what a rotten person I am.

A few little kids just came into a coffee shop very noisily and I tensed up immediately. Not because I thought they were misbehaving. They just trigger me now.

Surprisingly, I can manage when teaching as long as the parents aren’t pulling the “my precious baby does nothing wrong” crap.

Anyway. I’m highly anxious today and just looking for support.",24,1742141744.0,childfree,8,0.97,False
