[Also known as \\""Firewood Under the Snow\\"" Cake.  The version in this pic is without the sour cream topping.](https://preview.redd.it/mgsdhwuoo1td1.png?width=1777&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa844366499eea59140e17ea9a2b51eb46f7bf82)

Compared to other desserts we’ve written about, today’s recipe has a quite monumental structure - but it actually takes its inspiration from the most humble of architecture: I’m talking about **“Spruce House” Cake**[.](https://imgur.com/a/1QbHWPK)  Alternatively, this dish is often called the ""Monastery Hut"" cake, or even better - “Firewood Under the Snow” which I personally think is the most fitting title.

By any name, this dish resembles the roof of a traditional house (we wrote about them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vilc2o/447_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_120th_day_of/:)) and is very popular in Ukraine and in Moldova.  ""Spruce House"" is the name of a very popular old Ukrainian song that we will translate for you next week :)

The cake is rolled into tubes, filled with sour cherries, and stacked in a triangle - then coated with a sour cream frosting (fully substituting with whipped cream is a totally normal and acceptable thing).

[Mmmmm.](https://preview.redd.it/b59rtemto1td1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d7ac15bd461e3962291e51a6589b43458446eeb)

As you know from our series, Ukrainians love their cherries (see these dishes: [Drunken Cherry Cake](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/xzc54d/710_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_228th_day_of/) | [Vishnyak](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/xv4tgk/702_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_223rd_day_of/)) and their sour cream.  So let’s put those together, brick by brick!  Well... beam by beam.

As this is very likely a modern dish that was (probably?) created in the late 19th or 20th Century, we don’t have too much to write about in terms of its history.  So let’s proceed straight away with how to kick off this delicious construction project.

# How to Make Spruce House Cake

[Line em up!](https://preview.redd.it/skrt73fom1td1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9a4a50ac3b75b2ffd0306c02da7ee18e5fd47b8)

**Ingredients**

* Butter: 200 g, chilled so it can be grated
* Sour cream: 200 g
* Salt: 1/4 tsp
* Cake Flour: 350-400 g
* Heavy cream: 500 g (add more to taste)
* Powdered sugar: 250-300 g
* Sour cherries: 2 cans, or equivalent fresh

**Recipe**

1. To make the dough, take the butter out of the fridge. Grate the butter on a coarse grater. Mix the grated butter with flour. Add salt and 200 g of sour cream to the mix. Do not over mix. The mixture should not be fully smooth, so it can form layers during baking. Make a ball.
2. Divide the dough into 5 pieces, sprinkle them with flour, and place them in the fridge to cool. After cooling, roll each piece into a rectangle. The rectangle should be 25x30 cm in size (approx. 9x11 inches).
3. Cut the rolled-out rectangle into 3 strips. Place prepared cherries (gently press the water out) on each strip and roll them up to form tubes. To better seal the edges of the dough, brush them with water. Place the tubes on a baking sheet and bake them in the oven at 200°C (405F) until golden.
4. Once baked, remove the tubes from the oven and let them cool. After they have cooled, trim the edges to make them even.
5. To prepare the cream, take heavy cream and powdered sugar. Add vanilla sugar, mix gently, and whip with a mixer. When the cream is ready - you can assemble the cake.
6. Spread 2-3 tablespoons of cream on the plate where the cake will be placed. Arrange 5 tubes of baked dough with cherries in a row and cover them with cream. For each additional layer, place one fewer tube.
7. Put the cake in a cool place to set for at least 8 hours. After it has set, cover the cake with the remaining cream. You can decorate the cake with melted chocolate or chocolate shavings.

1. The last beer
2. One of the cats who would like more playtime
3. The embarrassing mess
4. The addiction
5. The reading
6. The weather

First off: I live in Montreal, and winter is around the corner. If you know this part of the world, you know what that means: ice storms, freezing rain, snow dumps, and occasional arctic wind coming down the river that hurts your lungs when you breathe too hard and gives you hypothermia even if you have a really dope parka. I will overcome. I'll fucking run in place under an awning where the concrete is bare, if I have to. I'll walk outside for as long as I can stand it if there's a cold snap.

Second: my apartment is my greatest shame, and it's only because I'm anonymous here that I show it. Part of the challenge is unfucking it. Depression be damned.

Third: I love my kitties. They will get more playtime with me.

Fourth: I don't drink huge amounts of liquor, but I do drink a tall can of beer more days than not. Giving up alcohol might be the hardest part.

Fifth: I already have a pretty healthy diet, so all I can really do, besides no alcohol, is cut out energy drinks. Only black coffee, tea, and yerba mate from now on.

Besides the weather trying to ruin my life, exercise and reading should be a breeze. I'm already a physically active bookworm.

Ingredients (Approximately)

- 4lbs of yellow cooking onions (tip: next time just buy large ones loose, instwad of the bulk bag, otherwise you spend two hours peeling and slicing)
- About 1/3rd cup raisins and 
1/4 cup dried cranberries, plumped up in a mix of hot water, white wine, and a dash of sweet vermouth 
- 2/3rd cup crabapple pieces
- fall spice: fresh ground nutmeg, a dash of ginger powder, a few cardamom seeds, cloves, allspice berries, 1 cinnamon stick broken up, a bit of rainbow pepper - all ground up in a coffee grinder
- about 2tbsp butter and 2tbsp olive oil

I melted the oils in a roasting pan on stove, added the spices to infuse the butter, added the onions and cooked them down a bit before adding the crabapples, and then the raisin-cranberry mixture (including the liquid to deflate the pan). The rest was just cooking everything down and getting the water boiled off. When the sugars started sticking to pan, I called it done. Tastes amazing, but doesn't look the greatest. Good on pork chops, or just on its own. ",1,1728182394.0,OnionLovers,0,1.0,False

I worked 10 hours and closed today, and I'm EXHAUSTED

All of my coworkers were apologizing to me that my second day was so busy (wedding across the street, plus a festival in the same area!!! Lots of people!!!) 
But I was totally unfazed TBH, if today was a busy day, normal days will be a breeze!!


Asking questions isnt scary at all, everyone is happy to help each other out, everyone was so encouraging (like cheering me on when i get stuff right) and coworker drama and animosity seems NON EXISTANT so far, which is SO awesome. Seems like every other job I've had, I had to deal with so much of that BS. 

I already feel 10x more confident in my skills. After 1 day I already feel like I have a much stronger grasp on the menu, POS, learned how to make lots of drinks, AND,
I had fun!!! I think I love this job!!! My anxieties yesterday seem kinda silly now. But I do want to thank everyone here for the advice and reassurances :-)

All of my coworkers I've met so far are amazing. The owners are a lovely couple (they came in to work today since it was so busy, one of them closed with me) and they are awesome people as well.

Oh yeah and we get free food and drinks, wheneverrrr :D (as long as we don't go too crazy ya know)
Veryyyy yummy, I'm excited to try out all the pastries and teas!!! (I'm not a big coffee person, and I don't want to give myself a caffeine addiction lol)

1fx6n8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1fx6n8j/thin_air/,Thin Air,"Summary: A long time airport bartender hears an unusual story from a young terrified traveler.

Thin Air

I worked as a bartender for an Irish-style pub in O'hare airport for, well, longer than I care admit here. Anyway, it was the closest bar to the United terminal and thus many a weary travelers' first stop off the plane and the last stop to the plane. I've met all kinds here – the anxious first time fliers, the seasoned once a month business tripper, the self-proclaimed explorer, the rich college kid, you name it, all land and take off from Micky's Pub – forgive the pun.

The thing I loved the most about the people were their stories. I've heard them all from the mundane, to the traveling nightmare, the strange coincidences. I remember a gent named James Mayfield flew into the stool closest to the tap one night and went on to spin me a yarn about his flight had made excellent time because of a tail wind and because of the early arrival he incidentally discovered his long distance girlfriend, who he had just flown out to see, was cheating on him. Of course then there was Ms. Lauren Naylor, her taxi's flat tire made her miss flight 93 on 9/11 and then, years later, a connecting flight delay caused her to miss boarding that cruise ship which disappeared a few years ago. All great stories but the man who sat at the stool close to the tap just a little over day and half ago takes the cake. 	His ID said his name was Greg Reeves. He was a young 21 year old kid, thin, he had this absolutely lost petrified look on his face as he shambled his way through the faux wooden doors into the low Irish Session background music. I immediately took him for the fear of flying/first time flier type and suggested he slug down a shot of jameson with a beer to take the edge off. My words seemed to fly right past him as he stared through the taps with his mouth half a gape and his eyes batting slow stunned blinks.

After a minute or so I crossed my arms impatiently peering down at him as he slowly mounted the stool. I began to wonder if he needed help or more importantly, needed to leave because he was already intoxicated on flight booze or maybe some kind of valium. After a few more shaky seconds he finally seemed to acknowledge my existence and then choked on his dry tongue to order a  double ginger and jamo. He started to flash a wad of cash so my worries took a back seat as I made his order.   	“Rough first flight? Where you from?”

“Near Cinci.” He stammered, “first time flying since.” He seemed to trail off while I mentally patted myself on the back for guessing his deal.

I turned around with his cold amber drink in hand and set it in front of him. That's when I noticed he was sweating more than that glass, “since what?” I asked while looking around the bar, noting that aside from a quiet couple couple at a 2 top, we were the only ones here and probably because it was still early in the morning on a Tuesday. He took a long pull off the straw and then his eyes suddenly seemed to pop back to life. “Since...” He coughed up part of the drink, “Do you really want to hear this story?”

I smiled and chuckled, “Sure why not kid, just don't make it all day, I don't got all day. Nah, that ain't true but make it kinda short Flight 1,” I trailed off, realizing the kid wouldn't know the significance of the flight number, “New York plane is due soon and I got more a few regulars gonna pop in here for an irish coffee or five, alright?”

“I grew up in Warren, Ohio.” He looked at me like I knew what he was talking about before. “It's that town with all the weird...”

“Warren?” I interrupted him because I did know the significance, “That place with all that weird weather back about ten years or so.”

Greg's eyes grew wider and locked in on mine, “Yeah. That Warren, Ohio.”

“You guys had all those freaky storms right? The one with the mites carried on the dust?”

Greg breathed in his drink then exhaled, “Oh my god. The dust sucked smothered the county but the mites came a day or two after it cleared. They got everywhere. Any place you could plausibly find dust they were there. Everyone I knew had bites or rashes over half their body. It felt like they were eating you between layers of your skin and they way some people looked when they had their rash breakouts, no doctor could tell em differently.”

Seemed like the kid had some of that childhood trauma pent up in him, I ain't no doctor but I recognize my role as a caregiver of sorts. Maybe I should have gone back to school to be shrink or something. My eyes pointed to his empty drink and he fired back an affirmative nod.

“We also had this once in a life time fall thunderstorm with the most constant lightning you've ever seen. Apparently, a huge flock of canadian geese were confused in the storm and the lightning, well, literally cooked those geese. They fell all around town. Everywhere you looked there were burned and mangled goose carcasses smashed on roofs and through windshields. Coyotes had a field day. One of the geese fell and smashed right through my skylight, landing at the foot my bed. Can you imagine being a kid and having a partially burned goose with its neck slit by glass bleeding out on your bed back lit by lightning strobes?”

I paused for a moment before replying as he seemed genuinely mortified re-living this moment in his head space. Two customers came in and sat in the far hook of the bar. “Nah,” I said, politely, forcing a smile to the new comers, “tell you what, next one is on the house, when I get back, I got a question for ya.”

Living in Chicago you get plenty of strange weather. I guess hearing about and talking about it is a hobby of mine. Maybe because it was easier than living with it. Call me intrigued by the kid's first hand accounts of some of the strangest weather I've ever heard of. One of those incidents stood out in my head, probably stands out in yours too if you followed any weather news or seen any strange weather documentaries. I guess it's got a lot of nicknames depending on who you listen to – The Squid, El Torro, The Bull, The Ace of Spades, The Reaper, Dead Man Walking – the massive F-5 tornado which seemed to spawn smaller tornadoes horizontally like an octopus spreads its tentacles or like massive horns and front legs from a charging bull from its mile-wide base as it seemed to circle the town of Warren. One of the docs I've seen said the phenomena was exclusive to this particular tornado.

I poured the new comers a couple of Guinness drafts then made my way back Mr. Reeves who sat there gnawing at his finger nails. I made him the promised third drink and asked him what it was like to see that tornado first hand.

“Yeah.” he said distantly, “It was pretty intense.”

I was left unfulfilled by his description. “Well, luckily it dissipated before it hit the town, right? No one died?”

Greg rubbed his five o'clock shadow, “My dad was in a plane that day. He was basically a crop duster pilot. I've haven't flown since he was still around.”

What can I say? I  struck a nerve but I was hooked by the kid at this point and had little else to do. “He used to take you up?” I danced around the fact I thought he was trying to say his dad may have died in flight because of the tornado. I just wanted to know more of his story.

“Yeah, the thing was back then he used to take pictures from the air of people's crops and than spray. You know, help the farmers find the wet spots and other trouble spots in their crops and field. You can do that with a drone now but back then, um yeah. That was my dad's thing and we'd fly all the time. I never thought I'd get this way.” His voice seemed to trail off then come back strong, “clouds!” he exclaimed. “My dad always said to never fly through clouds especially the little low puffy ones. Never said why.”

“Turbulence and visibility is my guess, especially in a little plane. Not as big of a problem for a jumbo jet I guess. Ah, what do I know, I work at an airport but I don't know jack about flying.”   	“Any pilot will tell you not to fly through the puffy clouds but anyway, my dad knowing I loved flying and everything about the sky gave me this model rocket with a little camera in it. You know, it's got a little firework rocket motor and pops the parachute out at the end and it took pictures all the way down on a little roll of film. Anyway, I remember the first day I got and we lit it up twice and on the third flight my dad had to go inside for something, I don't recall what. Anyway, I did something. I something I thought was impossible. I stacked few of the rocket engines together and then aimed it at a low puffy cloud. I was curious to see if I could reach it, if I could see what's inside.”

He made rocket noises and zipped his finger up from the bar towards the ceiling.

“I killed a cloud. I killed that cloud.”

I should have cut him off right there. I should have asked him to go but I was so damn locked in on his kid and his face and how sober he sounded as he went on. He described the cloud popping in the sky like someone puncturing a water balloon with all the water dropping out and bits of the latex skittering off. He told me it made an expression, a face that boiled away after the rocket popped it.

“That was the day it all started.” Greg declared. “I was soaked, never found the rocket again, and I was sad and that night we had the reddest sunset I had ever seen. I started seeing faces on the clouds – I thought it was just my imagination and of course, I didn't tell anyone, who's going to care if an eleven year old kid talks about stuff he see in clouds, anyway. At first they were sad faces like the greek tragedy masks everywhere I looked in the sky. Then the faces turned menacing almost demonic, always hanging just within sight, whether it was riding in the car, or out the window at school all day everyday. I refused to go flying with my dad again and I put a poster over my skylight so I couldn't see them. Then it got worse. A swarm of large dust devils ruined my little league game which could have brought us to State. They, the clouds, the weather, followed me everywhere, even on my twelfth birthday we took a trip to Disney World and it rained every day so much they closed most of the parks and we were stuck inside almost the whole time. Then the real dangerous weather started, the stuff you've heard about.”

I felt like I needed a drink and closure, “So your dad and your flight today and all of this?”

“A day before El Torro, he was hired to take photos over a corn field damaged by a huge hail storm the previous week. My dad showed me the photos when he confronted me. The hail damage carved into the crops spelled out in vague but still clear words “Greg. Greg. Greg”, my name. Dad warned me about never flying through clouds. He seemed to know already otherwise why confront me. I told him about the rocket and cloud. Then, the day of El Torro, he took off from the little airport during the storm and then the tornado and storm seemed to miraculously disappear. Authorities found my dad's plane completely intact landed in an empty field with no sign of him. They searched for two weeks from the ground, the air, and divers in a small lake and never found his body.”

“Then storms stopped?”

“Yeah, the storms and clouds stopped. I mourned dad with my mom and sister. We went on with our lives and moved away. I finished middle and high school, went to college, found a job, turned it requires travel and that brings me to here and now. I thought it was going to be okay to fly again.”

“What do you mean?”

“We hit cruising altitude and I was just beginning to relax. I pulled up my shade. It was nice clear dawn weather. But there he was. There was dad standing on a cloud shelf just close enough to see his wispy icy blue face. It was like he was part cloud and part ice. He was entombed but still alive, his eyes met mine, buried alive in the sky. He turned and his mouth opened like he was screaming at me, for me, for anyone. I gasped and shut the shade and kept it shut for the remainder of the flight.”

The kid went on a bit longer as I started to become less entranced and less enthralled with his story and increasingly considering calling some sort of mental health authority for the kid. Needless to say I silently cut him off but he didn't ask for another away. He went on to say that the image of his father imprisoned in the sky has shaken him and he was worried that the clouds would now remember him as the real killer and would come after him again. I blinked a few times and said nothing as he seemed to stare at me for any help I could offer in his time of crisis.

I walked away trying to figure out what I was going to do for the kid as I served a couple of new patrons. While I was talking to them, the kid just hurried for the door. Good riddance I thought after I checked to see he left cash. After I finished making a few rounds of irish coffee for the NY rush I came back to his stool and noticed the generous tip he left him along side a bar napkin on which he wrote: “It's happening again” with an arrow pointed behind me.

The kid parked himself in front of the TV with the Weather Channel on. They were going on about some kind of breaking news Particularly Dangerous Situation five out of five derecho from the west severe weather event forecasted to strike Chicago later in the day.

The weather channel, what do they know? Nothing because nothing like it happened in the evening, overnight or morning. I put all of it out of my head until the cops showed up a little after noon today. 	There were two detectives one was a federal air marshal and the other an airport cop or maybe he was some big wig with TSA. The marshal was by the book and serious but the other guy, the TSA guy or whatever was a bit more...errr...off. He wondered around the stool Greg sat in while the marshal grilled me.

They were asking for security footage of the morning and then finally about Greg. Did he say what he was doing here, where he was going, where he was from, did he say anything weird blah blah blah. I happily gave them the footage and the non-crazy cliffnotes of the story I wrote here. All of their questions seemed to be leading that he suffered some kind of mental break and then either had been found dead or they were concerned he was or had been a flight risk. Apparently the kid never showed up to his work conference and had instead after leaving my bar caught the first plane headed west before the storms were due to develop.

The marshal finished up with me after a few notes and seemed to head for the door. I asked them what happened to Greg. The marshal said he couldn't comment on an on-going investigation. The TSA agent seemed like he wanted to spill the beans but was gagged by his superior.

An hour later the same TSA guy came back and told me in no uncertain words that 253 people boarded the flight to Denver and 252 got off. There was no sign of an midair decompression event. They checked the cargo holds, they checked the whole plane, the septic tanks, they were checking the flight path post landing gear deployment – nothing, nada, zip. As the saying goes, and the whole reason I'm putting this out there, Greg Reeves seemed to have disappeared into thin air.

”well”, says the guy who wants to rip his head off, “I’m stupid and have no idea how to read social cues, and I often have a tendency to overthink literally everything I do.”

so yeah, this girl and I often look at each other whenever we are near each her, I have not been able to hang out with her alone, only in group settings of about 5-6 people. Anyway sometimes i look at her, and sometimes she looks at me, when we make eye contact we smile and look away.   
she has also waved to me in public, it was one of those wiggle finger “flirty“ waves, and I don’t know how to interpret that… she also laughs at my jokes, given I’ve been told I’m funny, but like most of my jokes are stupid and she still laughs at them, or at least smiles.

there seems to be genuine interest on both sides, but as previously stated I'm terrible at this kind of stuff.   
  
so I resort to the internet! The only place filled with the upmost and absolute truth, but seriously any advice? Im Thinking right now I’ll wait and keep interactions small but be sure to show interest before asking her to lunch or coffee or something casual later down the line.

It varies sometimes, but it smells legit rotten. My boyfriend describes it as mothballs lol. Of course worse in the morning when I wake up, which according to him stinks up our whole bedroom… but I noticed it smells worse after sugary drinks especially my morning coffee. I can taste a bitterness in the back of my throat sometimes. It’s embarrassing, I’m embarrassed  around him and other people, and it sucks. I thought it was a cavity or a filling issue since the smell comes from the area near my top right tooth filling but I’m beginning to think after my 3rd dentist visit, which they instead referred me to a periodontist even though I have zero cavities nor any sign of gum disease, that it has to be my tonsils. 

Now the thing is I don’t feel anything. My boyfriend tried to help me look and prod around back there with a q-tip but I’m terrified of touching my tonsils, when we tried it literally made me feel light headed. He said he wasn’t sure he really saw anything and neither did I after looking. I don’t feel anything funny either. So while I wait to get into my ENT doctor, any tips? Anyone have this issue? I do have a water flosser. I have a tongue scraper. I could use both of those more. But even after a nice brushing and flossing and mouthwash the smell comes back instantly.

I've been drinking caffeine in forms of tea and coffee for the last 3 years with some periods off from it. Last 1.5 years I was drinking 1-2 cups of coffee daily. I knew the time has come to quit it when I started to severely suffer from mental and physical health issues. However I didn't know how life-changing this decision would be for me. 

Let's talk about the withdrawals. 

1st week was absolute nightmare. I could barely get through my routines. I experienced severe fatigue, muscle weakness, anhedonia. 

2nd week headaches kicked in, as well as issues with short term memory and my ability to focus. I also started to experience derealization to the point I would hallucinate. It was bizzare. 

3rd week I finally started to feel better, though most days I was depressed. Still felt muscle weakness. My gym performance dropped about 30-40% without the caffeine. 

4th week I only sometimes experienced fatigue, though it was not a problem anymore. Depression I felt these weeks also started to vanish. 

And now about the benefits. 

Amazing sleep quality. This one is my favorite benefit. I just can not believe the childhood kind of quality sleep and beautiful vivid dreams I get. I sleep for 9 hours straight and feel so damn refreshed each morning. It's a blessing. Now I feel like I didn't ever get a proper night of sleep while I was drinking coffee. It's crazy

I feel happy. This came very unexpected. I actually started to smile randomly. Just because I'm alive and it feels good to be alive. It feels funny to say this, but I just feel good and positive, instead of always ruminating in thoughts of terror and the constant feeling like my life is going to shit. 

I got healthier physically. I have IBS and mild gastritis and dropping coffee took me miles further in my healing. There is some research that points to how coffee negatively affects the digestive system and creates obstacles in GI healing. The good sleep I began to have probably also helped majorly with this. 

I don't experience stress anymore. I have a responsible job that can be stressful and usually has a big load of different daily tasks. After quiting coffee I just feel calm no matter what I'm faced with. Almost alarmingly calm. Even if everything around me is burning, I just don't feel stress or anxiety anymore. I just do what is needed and don't think about it too much. 

At this point my gym performance is at about 80% of what it used to be. I feel mentally clear and generally good and energetic. I'm also a lot more social and feel excited about my life. 

So the question is - will I continue to stay off it? Well at this point I would feel stupid if I would trade all the described benefits just to feel a petty caffeine high. The tradeoff is not even closely worth it. 

However, I do believe in the therapeutic benefits that drugs can have if used properly. I could see myself doing caffeine once in 2-3 months, just to see if it can have any therapeutic effects for me. Caffeine is a stimulant. Stimulants open up a persons energetical resource. This can be used to be reminded of the potential you have, potential that can be used. However if you abuse any stimulant, even coffee which is considered not as potent as something like cocaine or amphetamines, you WILL pay the price. Learn how to generate energy naturally and you will become a happy and fulfilled individual.

1fx685g,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1fx685g/who_are_some_artists_of_another_generation_that/,Who are some artists of another generation that you feel your own generation of music nerds hasnt given due credit to? (If that's confusing I explain what I mean in body),"Cant figure out a concise way to explain what I mean in 300 characters. Here's what I mean:

With the giant music nerd communities seemingly 40% of the entire internet is dedicated to and the convenience of music streaming we arent limited to much any extent in our tastes and every music discussion I end up in both out in the world and online seems to point to every ""music nerd\*"" having an incredibly diverse taste (even to what sometimes feels to me in a competitive, performative way) that you could call diverse no matter how you cut it up. We all listen to both men and women (I'm bad here actually), artists of different races/nationalities/cultures and even languages, artists from a dozen different genres, artists from every decade since music's been being recorded and sold to the general public, etc. etc. etc. 

( \* When I say ""music nerd"" I mean anyone who loves music enough that they participate in passionate discussion of music and go out of their way to do so, doesnt necessarily have to be a musician or have dedicated their life to music in some way. Audiophile? Is that the word? A cinephile for music. 

Nope. Audiophile is about recording quality and tech. and such. According to Google the word is musicophile, for which the earliest known use is in a letter James Joyce wrote in 1931. Common Ireland dub. Common Joyce dub. Anyway.)

But despite the radical influx of new ways to find and listen to music other than from your friends and the radio or MTV I definitely feel strongly that there are generational influences that go very deep. They probably transcend a lot of the social barriers that I imagine used to be very stark like race or locality. 

I'm on the older end of Gen Z but I dont even necessarily mean ""generations"" so broadly. (Yes, the titles Boomer, X, Millenial, Z are subjective and not scientific facts. But they are useful pretty often, I think.) I was born in 1998 and in my experience everyone I meet younger than me even by a year loves J. Cole, everyone I meet my age or older either likes him very casually or doesnt listen to him. (Nobody hates him from what I can tell. Likable dude.) My younger brothers who arent that much younger than me show me rap music that is just purely nonsensical to me. I used to be with it. But then they changed what it was. Now what I'm with isnt it and what's it seems weird and scary to me. It'll happen to them.

American Idiot by Green Day came out when I was 6 or so and nobody I meet my age hates Green Day or post-Dookie Green Day the way people 10-15 years or so older than me all do. They *all* do (those pretentious pricks). Nobody younger than me hates Green Day.

(Disclaimer at an opportune moment: obviously I am generalizing here with every use of ""everybody"" and ""nobody"" I use in any context. Obviously I dont mean any of it literally. This is all based of course on the tiny, tiny fraction of music discussion that happens online and out in the word I happen to be witness or party to. But anecdotal evidence isnt the sin high school and undergrad rhetoric lessons make it out to be.)

Another good one is Kanye. Everyone my age and younger (maybe by only a few years) loves Yeezus and Pablo whereas people I meet older than me are much more mixed in their opinions on any post-MBDTF Kanye. They used to be with Kanye. But then Kanye changed what Kanye was. When Yeezus came out the Kanye they were with wasnt Kanye, and the Kanye that was Kanye seemed weird and scary to them. Or whatever. 

I always write too much. Anyway. Generational gaps, large and small, definitely seem to me to be determining factors in some percentage of a person's taste in music. Probably art period. But with the internet, and especially with the particularly sociophilosophical bent the internet has had the last ten years, there's equally abundant encouragement and access to music that without the internet would probably not have gotten to many of us. And we're all thrown in together. Obviously it's mostly Millenials, Gen Z, and whatever they're gonna call the post 2010 kids (Jesus a kid born in 2010, which was like 7 years ago max, turns 14 this year) but if you look at r/BobDylan you see plenty of comments from even older Boomers who have widened their taste in music since being exposed to the internet. 

On the one hand, the more important and much fuller hand, it's obviously a fuckin awesome thing. I get so much joy from music that I'd never have heard if not for a reddit comment or a friend who heard a song that Spotify just gave them based on the algorithm from an artist neither of us had ever heard of. 

Thanks to the internet I didnt get flushed down the Green Day-to-FOB and Panic! pipeline and instead found The Clash at 14 or so years old. 

Thanks to a reddit comment that quoted Steve Earle saying *“Townes Van Zandt’s the best songwriter in the world, and I’ll stand on Bob Dylan’s coffee table in my cowboy boots and say that,”* I discovered one of my now favorite artists of all time and wear cowboy boots every day. (Townes still aint quite Bob though. Close. But not Bob.) 

The internet has at the ready for me from dawn to dusk the lyrics and chords for damn near any song I might ever want to play on my guitar. 

The internet has created really a very magnanimous and evenhanded culture around popular music that everyone seems to get to participate in no matter what artist sparked the musicophile in their head. Rolling Stone, for all it's pandering, was basically forced by social pressure to widen its scope when it updated its top 500 albums/songs lists and gave a lot more credit where it was do to women and black artists, even when it was painful how little genuine passion and how much Don Draper It's Toasted bullshit went into choosing the order in which they listed. You see a lot less ""Eminem the GOAT"" horseshit in hip-hop discussion now than you saw 10 years ago. (Maybe that says more about Em than it does about us.) You also see a lot less hate for The Beatles than you used to from edgy dickheads who love to have a take. Look at the album cover for Pet Sounds again. Is it anything short of a fucking miracle that its beloved by streetwear tiktok baggy Billie Eilish pants e-girl brooklynites? (No hate in that description, if it fits you my DMs are open and I love Pet Sounds.)

But on the other hand, one I probably pay too much attention to, there's the frustration when an artist is seemingly missed by an entire generation of music nerds that ought not to be for hopefully no reason but chance alone. But its easy to find dumbass reasons too. 

Well maybe not dumbass reasons. To my fellow Zoomers: I get it. U2 forcing that lame album onto all our phones was annoying, corny, and invasive. But that is **no** reason to ignore the band that invented half the sounds on your Shoegaze playlist. U2 has a staggering discography. I've always liked U2 (they're another common Ireland dub) but it was only a couple years ago I dug into their discography and realized just how many great albums they put out in their prime. In terms of consecutive great albums they put numbers that put them, I think, undebatably in the A tier of post 1950 contemporary pop artists. Like the A tier directly under the Beatles, Dylan, Franklin, etc S tier. And if you include enough artists the A tier will start to get too crowded for U2. Even people who dont like The Beatles have stopped pretending they dont deserve the flowers they're thrown. But people my age and young dont even realize who this U2 they hate for an early technoculture faux pas are! My ex hated U2 but one time I was playing The Joshua Tree while she was off her ass on some edibles and when a guy walked up to Bono with a face red as the rose of a thorn bush, like all the colors of a royal flush, started peelin off those dollar bills and slappin em down, one hundred, two hundred, she couldnt help but turn to me, glasseyes halfclosed, and whisper in defeat ""This album is fucking insane."" 

But did she ever listen to U2 again? No! U2, *U-Achtung-motherfucking-Baby-2*, is relegated to the same brand of reputation as a Creed, a Nickelback? Insanity. Sure, they're not treated as badly. But the reactions are of the same kind. In Miller terms, Creed is Bad Band High Life, the Champagne of Bad Music. U2'd be Bad Band Lite, A Fine Hatable Band. It is insanity every which way *including* loose. 

I didnt actually even come to talk about U2. Is my nose bleeding? (I'm not on coke I'm just kidding. It's adderall.) 

The artist I wanted to give as my example is Bruce Springsteen. If my dad werent a huge Bruce fan I would at least not have discovered him as early as I did and chances are high I would never have. But my dad doesnt like Bob Dylan and I still came across him. Why a person who likes Bob wouldnt listen to Bruce is beyond me. It was the way Bob scratched my Bruce itch that got me hooked on Bob until it became the Bob itch that Bruce scratches. And when it comes to composition, crafting a rock n roll song? Forget about it. Bob doesnt have a Kitty's Back nor a Jungleland. Bruce doesnt have a Times They Are a-Changin either, sure. But his lyrical chops get closer to The Times than even Dylan most musical work gets near a Kitty's Back. 

Here's where it gets painful, even moreso than U2 who at least did it to themselves (but I guess that's just why it hurts?). I think, and I hope I'm wrong and it's as simple as an accident of posts that could have spread the gospel of Springsteen not gaining traction, but I think I know why Bruce didnt connect with Gen Z at the moment everyone realized wait! Americana is cool and part of being a well rounded culture junkie! Quick to the Bob-Townes-Parton-mobile!

I think what did it is the Born in the USA hook and album cover achieving for hip young Brooklyn twitter kids the same thing it did for Ronald Reagan. Just like Reagan they missed the political message behind the feigned patriotic bombast. You could say it's partially Bruce's fault because he doesnt like to make it easy to make out his lyrics. I'm still not quite sure whether the picture Bruce has of his brother and the woman he loved at Khe Sanh is in his hometown or hers. And because he went from the Born in the USA lyrics and the No Nukes Concert to faking a southern accent for his dang ol podcast with President Dronestrike. 

But if Steve Earle will stand on Bob Dylan's coffeetable in his cowboy boots and go to bat for Townes I'll do the same in my Timbs and Yankee hat for Bruce.

Off the top of my head I can also think of:

The modern white hip hop heads to which I owe my allegiance sleep on Lil Wayne and this year I discovered that it's not just MBDTF vs. TPAB but MBDTF vs. TPAB vs. Tha Carter II. And I think Tha Carter II might take it. 

Millenials seem to be much more open to the idea that The Killers are more than just a one hit wonder. Lately in particular I've been playing some Killers songs and I never realized what a beast their guitarist is. Also, if you havent been told, and you probably have it, The Killers have the best drummer of the post-Y2K rock era. And Sam's Town is just as great as whatever indie album with a dumbass name like I Really Need To Crack My Neck But It Wont Crack So Now I'm Just Sitting Here On The 6 Train With a Stiff Neck by the buttsniffers no caps you say is our generations Velvet Underground & Nico.

1fx683e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tunex2014/comments/1fx683e/how_to_create_a_productive_workspace_anywhere/,How to Create a Productive Workspace Anywhere,"https://preview.redd.it/5w9z9kkdo1td1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a5241651614c6f3e3f65a33163aa803c39a0aa0

In today’s mobile world, the idea of work being limited to a traditional office is quickly becoming outdated. Whether you’re a digital nomad exploring the globe or a freelancer working remotely from home, creating a productive workspace anywhere is essential to staying focused and efficient. But it’s not just about setting up a desk; it’s about cultivating an environment that supports your work habits, creativity, and overall well-being.

In this guide, we’ll explore the strategies and tools you need to design a productive workspace—whether you’re in a cozy coffee shop, a bustling coworking space, or a temporary home office.

# 1. The Importance of a Dedicated Workspace

One of the first things to recognize when trying to be productive in any environment is the importance of having a dedicated workspace. Having a consistent space for work, even when traveling or working remotely, sends a signal to your brain that it’s time to focus. This doesn’t necessarily mean you need a traditional office setup—your workspace could be a specific table in a coffee shop, a nook in your living space, or even a park bench with a strong Wi-Fi connection.

# Key Benefits:

* **Increased Focus**: A designated area helps your mind switch into “work mode” more easily.
* **Better Work-Life Balance**: When you define a space for work, it becomes easier to separate personal life from professional tasks.
* **Improved Efficiency**: Having a space equipped with everything you need reduces distractions and promotes consistency in your workflow.

If you’re a digital nomad or frequent traveler, try to create a temporary but consistent setup wherever you are staying—this could be at your Airbnb or a coworking space.

*Pro Tip: Invest in a* [*portable laptop*](https://amzn.to/4gWu1wf) *stand and* [*wireless keyboard*](https://amzn.to/3ZTwyRV) *to recreate an ergonomic workspace wherever you go.*

# 2. Choosing the Right Environment for Productivity

Not all workspaces are created equal. The environment you choose has a direct impact on your ability to focus, stay motivated, and complete tasks efficiently. When choosing your workspace, take into consideration factors like noise levels, lighting, and overall atmosphere.

# Things to Consider:

* **Noise Levels**: Are you someone who thrives in a bustling environment, or do you need absolute silence to focus? Choose a space that aligns with your personal preferences.
* **Lighting**: Natural light is ideal for productivity and boosts mood. If you can’t access natural light, try to position yourself near good artificial lighting.
* **Comfort**: Make sure your chair and desk setup (or equivalent) support good posture. Uncomfortable environments can lead to distractions and decreased productivity.
* **Internet Speed**: For remote workers, a stable and fast Wi-Fi connection is non-negotiable. Always check the Wi-Fi strength before committing to a spot.

# Ideal Workspaces:

* **Coworking Spaces**: Great for networking and having access to professional amenities like meeting rooms.
* **Coffee Shops**: Perfect for short bursts of productivity, especially if you thrive in dynamic environments.
* **Home Offices**: Provide ultimate control over your environment but require discipline to separate work from personal life.

Consider using apps like *Workfrom* or *Nomad List* to find the best places to work remotely in your location.

# 3. Setting Up Ergonomically Wherever You Are

Whether you’re working from a hotel room or a local cafe, ergonomic setup should be a priority. Poor ergonomics can lead to discomfort, neck and back pain, and even long-term health issues. Thankfully, with a few portable tools, you can set up an ergonomic workspace no matter where you are.

# Essential Tools for Ergonomic Comfort:

* **Portable Laptop Stand**: Elevates your laptop to eye level, reducing strain on your neck.
* **Wireless Keyboard and Mouse**: Avoids awkward typing positions and encourages proper arm posture.
* **Noise-canceling headphones**: helps you stay focused in noisy environments; a must for digital nomads.
* **Compact Desk Chair Support**: If you’re going to be seated for long hours, invest in a portable lumbar support cushion or consider working while standing when possible.

These small adjustments can go a long way in creating a comfortable and efficient workspace anywhere.

# 4. The Power of Personalization

One of the perks of creating a workspace anywhere is the ability to personalize it according to your style and needs. This might seem trivial, but personal touches can help you feel more connected and motivated. When you’re working in unfamiliar environments, a few familiar items can bring a sense of comfort and boost productivity.

# Tips to Personalize Your Workspace:

* **Add Visual Cues**: Personal photos, motivational quotes, or your favorite mug can give you a sense of belonging, no matter where you are.
* **Incorporate Greenery**: Adding a plant or two can boost creativity and reduce stress, especially if you’re working from a more sterile environment like a hotel room or office.
* **Keep It Minimal**: Too much clutter can be distracting. Keep your essentials close but avoid overwhelming your space with unnecessary items.

# Travel-Friendly Personalization Ideas:

* **A Foldable Whiteboard**: Great for jotting down ideas and keeping track of tasks.
* **Digital Inspiration Boards**: Use online tools like Pinterest or Trello to create vision boards that inspire you, no matter where you are.

# 5. Time Management Techniques to Maximize Focus

Having a productive workspace is only half the battle—effective time management is crucial for getting work done, especially when distractions are everywhere. Whether you’re traveling or working from home, adopting certain time management techniques can help you stay on track.

# Popular Time Management Techniques:

* **The Pomodoro Technique**: Work for 25-minute intervals followed by a 5-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer 15–30 minute break. This method helps maintain focus and avoid burnout.
* **Time Blocking**: Allocate specific blocks of time for tasks and stick to the schedule.
* **Task Prioritization**: Start your day by identifying the top three most important tasks. Focus on completing these before moving on to less urgent tasks.

# Time Management Tools:

* **Toggl**: A simple time-tracking tool to monitor your productivity.
* **RescueTime**: Helps you analyze how you spend your time online and provides insights for improvement.
* **Trello**: A project management tool perfect for keeping track of tasks and deadlines.

By managing your time effectively, you’ll create a workflow that maximizes your productivity and leaves room for exploration.

# 6. Staying Connected While Working Remotely

When you work outside of a traditional office, staying connected with clients, colleagues, or your team can be challenging. Communication is key to maintaining productivity and ensuring work gets done seamlessly, no matter where you are.

# Best Tools for Remote Communication:

* **Slack**: Ideal for instant messaging and team collaboration.
* **Zoom**: Great for video meetings and conference calls.
* **Google Drive**: Easily share documents and collaborate in real-time.

Regular check-ins and clear communication can help avoid misunderstandings and keep everyone on the same page.

# 7. Combating Distractions While Working on the Go

One of the biggest challenges of working from anywhere is managing distractions. Whether it’s the hustle and bustle of a café or the allure of a nearby beach, staying focused on work can be tough. However, with the right strategies in place, you can minimize distractions and maximize productivity.

# Tips to Minimize Distractions:

* **Use Productivity Apps**: Tools like *Focus@Will* or [*Brain.fm*](http://brain.fm/) provide focus-enhancing background music designed to help you stay on task.
* **Set Boundaries**: If you’re working in a shared space, kindly let others know when you’re in “focus mode” to avoid interruptions.
* **Stay Organized**: Keep your workspace clean and free from unnecessary clutter that can distract your mind.

# 8. Balancing Work and Exploration

One of the biggest perks of being a digital nomad or remote worker is the freedom to explore new destinations while working. But striking the right balance between work and play can be tricky.

# How to Find Balance:

* **Set clear boundaries**: define specific work hours and stick to them. Outside of these hours, fully engage in exploring your surroundings.
* **Batch Work**: Dedicate certain days or times for deep work, and leave other blocks of time open for adventure and exploration.
* **Take Full Breaks**: When it’s time to disconnect from work, do it completely. Immerse yourself in your surroundings and recharge your energy.

*Pro Tip: Consider joining group tours like* [*this*](https://heylink.me/tunextravels/) *that offer flexibility around your work schedule, so you can explore without the stress of planning!*

# Conclusion

Creating a productive workspace anywhere may seem daunting at first, but with the right mindset and tools, it’s entirely achievable. Whether you’re working from a bustling café or a serene park, the key is to build an environment that fosters focus, creativity, and well-being.

By prioritizing ergonomics, personalizing your space, managing your time wisely, and choosing the right environment, you can thrive in any setting. So go ahead, find that perfect corner in the world, and turn it into your own productivity powerhouse!",1,1728180576.0,u_tunex2014,0,1.0,False

Anyways, with that being said, it’s starting to look like I need to take any job I can get next to keep afloat. To be clear, that’s a full-time job or a contract job, not something part-time like working at a coffee shop, retail, etc. (nothing wrong with that, but I’d prefer to work in my field).

earlier this morning, he called me to do something and to no surprise i couldn’t hear him calling my name and he told me i need to crack open my door and leave one ear open. i tried explaining to him that i can’t leave one ear open because i wouldn’t be able to hear properly. i used to only use one ear in fear of getting yelled at because whenever i didn’t hear him, he would storm into my room with anger and just turn off my console and yank my headset off while pointing his finger in my face shouting at me. i would get my console taken for a whole day because of that and i lived in fear of it for so long. 

a couple hours later in that same day he came storming into my room because i couldn’t hear him calling my name and told me to turn off console. he started telling me that i should be keeping one ear open and listening out but i tried telling him that i was in competitive match but he didn’t care. i tried listing other ways he could’ve called me instead of shouting and me not being able to hear him. i said he could text me or call my phone or even send my little brother to come get me. he seemed offended that i would even say something like that and said he wasn’t going to do that. later he apologized for screaming and was telling me that i need to keep my headset on one ear and paying attention and instead of just talking to him about it further, i just gave up. i see my other friends and their parents will either call them or go up and get them. it just feels so unfair. and i’m not sure what to do",1,1728179775.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

This is kinda just a cry for help at this point i feel like I'm going down a very very slippery slope of loneliness

A little backstory, I'm still living at home, the housing market is crazy especially for a single person, I work from home too for my father's company so I talk to about 2 people a day in work both being my parents so I don't talk to alot of people just on a daily basis

I've currently 4 friends, one is online, one never shows up to events and the other two I'll meet with occasionally but it's hard to meet up with them

I am doing things I like, I'm big into pokemon go, plants, taking pictures, lego, going out for coffee. So I will do these things daily, I do stuff that I enjoy pretty often but it's just not giving me that serotonin anymore if that makes sense

So that's my rough situation but this is the part that's really screwing with my head that's making me feel so lonely

This year alone I've been on 6 first dates, none of them lead to a second date, I felt like two of the dates went amazing but I ended up getting ghosted from each of the 6 date anyways. I've paid for 6 months of tinder platinum and it now have recently paid for HingeX  

Like I've never been on a second date, never had someone (not family) tell me that they love me and want to be around me, never had someone to just be around and not feel judged, to just feel wanted by someone else.

I'm mid 20s and these are meant to be the best years of your life and all that but they're the most lonely I've ever felt, like is it going to get worse? Is this the best years of my life just endlessly trying to meet people and feel wanted?

I'm naturally a happy kinda upbeat type of person and like once a month I just crash with loneliness.

I get pretty anxious in public so you won't see me out at a bar (because I also don't drink) but you will see me outdoors on walks pretty often, I love the outdoors but it is kinda scary going out into the woods by yourself and it's also lonely not having anyone to talk to either

I've never gone to therapist before either, they are expensive and I'm on minimum wage so money doesn't come by that easy. I never talk to people about my mental health I don't like bothering people with it I just bottle it all up, that bottle is getting so full now though

My week just consists of Mon-Fri work, have dinner with family. Weekend go for a walk come home and try texting people to try go on a date and going to bed feeling lonely

It's nearly 3am for me so I'm posting this and going to bed, I've a feeling tomorrow's gonna be a tougher day then tonight so I might end up deleting this, but I'm not doing good mentally",1,1728179694.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

Since not much was available here in Germany for a long time, I got vyvanse and I'm not happy with it because when it stops working I become aggressive and very restless. And I can't stand restlessness very badly, that's a no go for me and I'll stop after a week because this restlessness has been going on for 7 hours tonight and I can't see how I'll be able to sleep. 
Especially since I don't notice anything positive after taking it, my head is still loud and I'm more jittery than without it because I feel like I've drunk too much coffee.

I knew beforehand that the short effective time would be my main problem because I simply know my body well.

 I know it's stupid, everyone is different and all, but I now have a little respect for trying something new because I'm afraid that everything will trigger this restlessness.

So, a 19-year-old, previously released on bail, plotted a mass shooting, bombing, train derailment, and poisoning of the water supply.  
So, we banned Nazi symbols, but are allowing practitioners of the religion of peace to display Islamic terrorist symbols while celebrating a terrorist attack.
So, conflicts from the Middle East are unfolding on our streets.  
So, youth crime has reached an all-time high.
So, the government is importing military-aged men from third world countries en masse. 

But perhaps these changes are a sign of progress. As Australia becomes more diverse, we're embracing cultures and experiences that make us stronger as a society. Yes, there are challenges, but the fact that we are no longer divided by racism is a testament to our growth. Our openness to people from the lowest walks of life and from the most radical third world nations, enriches our communities.

1fx5nh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1fx5nh8/unnoticed_overstimulated_and_feeling_a_break/,"Unnoticed, overstimulated and feeling a break ","Okay, before jumping into this. This is just a vent moment on a soap box. I apologize now for any and all grammar and punctuation mistakes now, I have dyslexia with reading comprehension issues(also typing this out on my phone). I will re-read this before I post to make sure it's not that bad I hope at least. I was gonna post it on a throwaway account but that's,  because I don't want my venting to reach my family and then have them giving me the pitty looks and ""it's okay dear"" crap. Yet for some reason I have to have karma points and I barely do of corse but it is what it is. So hopefully I the family won't see it. The vent will mainly be about the fact I feel lost in my life or at least mentally. Yes, from my last doctor appointment I do have PPD from my first pregnancy and supposed to be taking anti-depression stuff. I say supposed to be taking them but I have a habit of forgetting to take meds my whole life. Don't get me wrong it helped in the beginning but also showed me the cracks in my life and made me sometimes more sadder. So I said fuck it, now my doctor does think I am still taking them but I haven't been taking them for  almost 9months now. (Probably due to child trauma when I was put in Ritalin for my dyslexia in elementary, messed me up big time physical and abit mental.)

Now on to I guess my vent now, I 35f feel completely lost or alone or I don't know anymore. Somedays I feel like ""okay it's what ever day it is, let's see if I don't cry today for no reason"" or at lest feels like no reason at all. I make it through the day with my 20month kiddo as a SAHM living with my inlaws and mid90's great grandma. While my husband 35yr works his blue collar hvac. We make things work with having to live together while saving up to purchase a house for our selves and honestly I wish it was coming sooner so then I can possibly have my own area and not feel like everyone is on top of everyone. Plus just to feel like a I have a ""place"" to go when I wanna scream from frustration or throw myself into pillows to cry and a big blanket to hide myself away. A place that don't have to feel like I'm getting a look of judgement, because even tho my mother in law was also a SAHM herself, she is from a different generation. Though same generation as my parents, just different religions so there is a different there. Inlaws LDS and I was raised Christian/Catholic. I do respect their faith and high respect to them, because they have built an amazing life and was able to give their kids so many memories of their travels and time in the military. Husband was just a military kid didn't serve but always showed respect to all military members thanks to his fathers parenting. My husband is more of a jackLDS if some of you know what that means cool makes thing easier to understand how me and my husband work together. 

So needless to say a good comparison between my family and his, is my family are a mix pot of coffee at the end of a weekend long of rodeo and it's the final perf and I'm in small stock waiting for the last roppen caf come throw the gate to lock up, but instead the caf's horn knocks out your tooth while running up in front of ya. So you swear like a sailor and drink on beer while holding another can to your face to bring down the swelling, and this has actually happened one year working rodeo. So needless to say there is a difference in personalities in the house.

 Now since after my pregnancy I've noticed I've withdrawn from friends and as well make attempts to seem like a social person would do. Now it's not for the lack of trying, like I've tried and either it's something that came up for them or massage left unread till end of night and noticed it's been read but no reply so that's a fun feeling in the gut. Then there are the times my husband's friend will invite us out with others and to my brain possibly make new friends finally sense moving to the town I'm out back in 2011 it's been hard to make actually good friends I've had a few that I thought were the real ones but as high school like still seems to feel like, they fade and left without word. so I would have to say my husband is my only friend here but you know as a female how long that works for us. There's something different about being able to vent to another female, or have a garden sesh without judgment. to vent about inlaws, how my kid drives me crazy at times(you know that seen in the movie from monster-inlaw with Wanda Sykes saying""your the reason your mother is insane!"" i feel that sentence there with my kid at times, the only difference is that mom could pay for a therapist lol) but I'm starting to side track there sorry.. 

So anyways get invited to the gathering and let's just say when I was younger it was so much easier to make friends because as kids it can go either way of yay! you made a friend with someone that is as hyper and active as yourself or they move on to the next time that they have more in common with. and that's fine but when getting older and was labeled as the hyper loud one it's harder to make them.  Ist because I'm hyper though, it's because being told repeatedly over and over and over and fucking over again that ""your just hyper you need to slow down"" and quiet yourself, that it has made me so self conscience that I now either shit the hell up and barely say anything, because in my brain I'm thinking I sound like a fucking idiot. Or when I do join in a conversation I mess up my words and get laughed at. I hold it together but inside I'm crying bc I don't know how to act. it's like I'm over stimulated with my emotions. That's why sometimes a hit off the pen shuts up those thoughts of self defecation but doesn't make them go away. I've been told I should talk to a therapist.. and to that fuck wish I could be the only therapy I would probably be able to do is manual labor like, because as some of you guys reading I jump all over the place and still having a hard time staying on one spot, so having something distracting helps at least I think. Yet I know I could find someone... yet the past experience of finding or trying to get in to see some one was futile and frustrated to the point I would just be cussing up an storm, because why that fuck should I try nothing happens or I don't get a call back, so that deters me from even seeing one even more. As I type this out I'm realizing that's how it feels when I try to make friends. Example: you meet a new person, both parts express they would like to hang out. and when the one party trying to reach out to see about that hang out time and left in the dusk. fucking sucks, sorry for the long rant there, I think I need to take a break tonight and cry a little in my closet in peace before my husband comes home.

So far the changes I have made are:

\*Going to the gym- obviously not going to be possible for everyone, but movement makes a huge difference. Other than when I was cutting calories too low and getting cravings, I have noticed a huge spike in energy and lower cravings for foods. Somehow I now have more mindfulness of how foods affect me/how they make me feel the next day.  
\*Tracking/monitoring calories- At first I tracked everything I ate, but eventually got a feel for what I do (I am relatively routine oriented and eat the same things consistently), and now I just monitor when I do something outside of the norm.

\*Cutting back the sugary drinks- this one was TOUGH at first, because I love a good latte or chai from the local cafe or my fancy coffee gadgets, but cutting those back helped me save almost 2500 calories a week (roughly 300-350 calories per drink). I've gotten to where I don't want them anymore for whatever reason. Over the past 14-16 weeks it has calorically been equivalent to 11 pounds. I do still get the loaded teas that are sugar free if I need it/meeting friends, but those are very few and far between

\*Changing my mindset about eating- I used to eat until I felt full, but I changed my mindset to eat until I'm not hungry anymore. That alone reduced my eating by around 30-40% per meal and I no longer feel uncomfortable or like I need to rest after a meal.

\*Not eating carb heavy items right before bed- this one is probably a little controversial, but I do continue to eat pretty much every food that doesn't make me feel like crap. I had one high quality chocolate truffle today. It was amazing and I could stop at just one (I used to not be able to when I went total deprivation diet). But, if I ate one 30 minutes before bed or some other high carb item, I wake up feeling like I haven't eaten in days. I guess it makes sense since hunger hormones can be influenced by blood sugar, but I don't know a ton about that.



These may not work for everyone, but they seem much more simple/attainable than a lot of the diet plans/diets/workout routines you see all over social media and may be worth a shot for someone who is struggling. It was a slow start, but now these steps are so much easier and the results are seemingly ""snowballing"".",6,1728178598.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,1.0,False

There I was, smoking my cigarette. My day was going fine; I was giving one of my clients some space. It’s always hard saying goodbye for the first or second time. You see, I’m in a line of work that most people wouldn’t consider ethical. Allow me to explain: in this world, a good number of people have some ability or superpower, if you will. Mine happens to be necromancy.

 Now, I know what you’re thinking—necromancy is an evil power, and all necromancers are evil. I would agree that most of my kind are like that. I’ve met a few who enjoy raising undead armies and battling with the heroes. But me? I use my powers to save lives and help people. For a small fee, I raise the dead of criminals, either to have them live out their sentence in jail or to get information on them.

I also help people by raising their loved ones. Sometimes, people need closure or just want to see their loved ones one last time. It’s a way for them to make peace with their loss. I do have one rule, though: I never raise someone permanently. I feel like it goes against the natural order of things. Even though most of the world goes against the natural order, I believe life and death should remain final, despite my ability to defy it

“This is always the hardest part.” I took a deep breath and sighed deeply.

I looked over at Mr. Smith and Ms. Smith. They looked happy. Mr. Smith had set up blankets for them to sit on. They had been talking for an hour now, laughing, crying—they did it all. And now it was time to end this, or it would never end. I approached Mr. Smith, passing many other graves and souls who reached out to me, but I did not answer.

Mrs. Smith noticed me first and nodded. I grabbed Mr. Smith’s shoulder and said in a calm voice, “It’s time to say goodbye, Mr. Smith.”

“Can I have just a little more time? Please! I will pay you for more time,” he said, his voice shaking.

Before I could say anything, Mrs. Smith grabbed his face and kissed him.

She pulled away and said, “Honey, you have to let go.” Her voice was saddened, but she accepted the end.

“But Aurora… my love, I can’t.”

“Yes, you can, Arthur. And when it’s your time, I’ll be waiting for you, my darling.”

“Okay, my love,” he said sadly, then turned to me. “Can I hold her while she goes?”

“Of course, Mr. Smith. Now, Mrs. Smith, close your eyes.”

“Will it hurt?” she asked.

I smiled and said, “Of course not. You will go peacefully, like a blowing breeze.”

She took a deep breath. “Okay, I’m ready.” She pulled close to Mr. Smith.

I prepared to send her back to the afterlife. It’s really simple—all I needed to do was touch her head and she would be off. I reached for Mrs. Smith’s head, then suddenly a flash of light, and they were gone.

“Damn it, heroes!” I scanned my surroundings, looking for Mrs. Smith and Mr. Smith, but I didn’t see them anywhere. Another flash of light, and I was flying into a gravestone. I heard a crack, and a sharp pain shot up my right rib. I yelled in pain.

I looked over at my attacker. She stood about ten feet away, a spear raised and ready. She wore a red cloak and a tight red super-suit. A full mask covered her face, and her bright golden hair was done up in the back.

“Your evil deeds are done, necromancer! I will not let you torment those innocent people anymore,” she shouted.

“This is bad. I hate it when they always get the wrong idea,” I said, coughing.

I pushed myself up. “I was only trying to help him feel better,” I said, gritting my teeth against the pain.

She stammered for a second before coming up with our own conclusion.“Do you think I would fall for your cowardly tricks, villain? You must take me for a fool. I saw what you were about to do to those people. You were going to turn them into your undead and then this entire place, but I will stop you,” she shouted back with authority.

“This is why I dislike heroes—always looking for a fight when there is none. Always so arrogant and never trying to reason. But I can’t blame them for doing their job.

“You dare call me arrogant? You don’t know who I am,” she said, her voice dripping with pride.

“Frankly, I don’t care who you are at the moment,” I managed to say while standing up. I reached for my knife on my left side and pulled it out, readying myself.

“I am the great Hero Artoria, and you will surrender yourself to me!”

Shit! Out of all the heroes, it had to be Artoria, the Hero of Light, also known as the Goddess of Speed. If I had to pick the worst opponent, this was the one. But I can’t back down now.

“If I have to fight, then I’ll fight. Just know you asked for this fight, not me.”

The moment I said those words, another flash of light occurred, and I found myself pinned to a tree, my knife flying in the opposite direction. Artoria was holding me by the neck, her eyes boring into mine as I struggled to breathe.

“I have you now, villain,” she boasted.

“Stop!” I heard someone shout from my right. It was Mrs. Smith, running back with Mr. Smith trailing behind.

Artoria turned away from me for a split second, which was just enough time for me to implement my plan. Even though I hated doing this, I had no choice right now. I began concentrating on the area around me, specifically the souls and their bodies. I willed them to come to me.

“Stay back, civilians! This man is dangerous!” Artoria shouted.

Just as she said that I struck Artoria’s arm joint, pulling her closer before kicking her to the ground. As she hit the ground, pools of skeletal arms burst forth, grabbing and restraining her. I fell to my knees, coughing, while Artoria cursed at me.

I quickly reached for my gun on my right side, pulled it out, and shot Artoria three times. She yelled in pain but soon realized these weren’t bullets.

“What have you done to me?”

“I don’t make a habit of killing heroes; these were tranquilizers, but they still hurt,” I replied.

“When I get out of these, I will stop you!” she screamed.

I finally spoke up. “What I’ve been trying to tell you is that I am not your enemy. I’ve only been helping my clients. But now, you’re not going to stop me from doing anything, and you’re going to sleep for a while.”

“He is right, Miss Artoria. He only brought me back to see my husband one more time,” Mrs. Smith said.

“That’s right. We’re sorry for the confusion,” Mr. Smith chimed in.

Artoria looked at them, locking eyes with Mrs. Smith, and nodded before her head fell back and she went to sleep.

I turned my attention back towards Mrs. Smith and Mr. Smith with deep gratitude for helping me in the situation.

“I am deeply sorry, Mrs. Smith and Mr. Smith. These things don’t normally happen, especially when I’m in front of clients,” I said while kneeling and bowing my head. “For the trouble, I will not charge you for my services.” 

“It’s okay, sir. Honestly, this is still one of the best days of my life because I get to see my wife again,” he smiled and looked towards Mrs. Smith. “I know now it’s time to say goodbye. I am ready.”

“Okay, let us begin. Mrs. Smith, come forward. Mr. Smith, hold your wife. Close your eyes, think of something happy, and say your final words.”

“Arthur, I love you. And I’ll see you later, my love,” she said sweetly.

I smiled, stepped forward, and placed my hand on her forehead. A light shimmered from the place I touched, and Mrs. Smith slowly turned into shimmering golden light, fading into the sky.

“Thank you,” said Mr. Smith. “I’ll be heading out now. Thank you again for letting me see my wife.”

I watched him as he returned to his car and sighed. It had been a long day, but there was still one more issue to handle. I turned back towards Artoria. A flash of light, and she was standing in front of me.

“I knew those tranquilizers wouldn’t hold you down. I’ve heard people tried that before, but you recover quickly,” I said while holstering my gun.

“I’m sorry for attacking you without reason. I’ve had bad experiences with necromancers, and I didn’t want to make that same mistake again.”

“I understand that most necromancers aren’t like me, but I wish you heroes would talk more often instead of jumping straight into a fight. It would save me a lot of time, you know.”

“Why do you say ‘you heroes’? You act like you’re not a hero yourself,” she asked, confused.

“I don’t consider my job heroic. After all, I get paid for doing this. It’s not like I’m doing it out of the goodness of my heart.”

“I don’t believe that’s true. The way you smiled after releasing that woman’s soul and helping her husband—you had pure intentions in your heart,” she said warmly.

Maybe she was right, or maybe I was just foolish to think my way.

“Do you want to get coffee?”

“What?” I stammered, caught a bit off guard.

“Do you want to get coffee?” she asked again.

“Why?” I replied, confused and flustered.

“To repay you and to get to know you better. As a hero, I should know other heroes better. Besides, you seem like a nice soul,” she said with confidence, but I knew she was blushing under that mask.

Seems since COVID times (maybe its been around longer but everything before then is fuzzy!) been an explosion at cafes, bars etc of table bookings monopolising establishments). From a customer point of view it sucks turning up to a near empty cafe or bar (especially if its your local that you have invested a lot of business into) and being told you cant get served as about to be full or you can but you have a window and then have to leave or move as tables booked. Its personally modified my behaviour in that i have started not turning up to certain places that were once locals. As an example our local brewery, a group of us used to turn up every Sunday avo after weekend tasks and have a few beers, grab some food. The place has made a massive push post covid to get people to book tables in advance (fb ads push this). We got annoyed turning up to what was our local of 8years , and being told when often visibly empty that place was full, or we could have a table for 20 or 30m then needed to move. As such our Sunday sessions have moved and the business has lost about 5k a year in patronage per person. I would have thought that a person in your premise spending money is better than an indication that a person may or may not turn up. Keen for thoughts? Does this annoy other customers? Has it influenced your behaviour? Business owners do bookings improve your business? Or could you gain better operational efficiency without them?
(Before its stated - yes we could book too. But i don't want to have to book every week i go to a local for beer or coffee. Im keen to be spontaneous and turn up and grab a free table. Yes if its full then ill go elsewhere, but to have to go elsewhere when clearly empty is frustrating. Tags on tables aren't making purchases...we would be)  ",0,1728178336.0,melbourne,5,0.5,False

This is also a long post so be prepared to read :)
I (18F) am a freshmen in college and recently moved in about a month and a half ago. I decided to choose a random roommate because I was afraid I would end up hating my friend’s habits and that would affect our already existing friendship. I met my roommate on move in day. Her name, for the sake of privacy, is Addison (18F). Addison was very energetic and excited to meet me she hugged me on sight. I liked her immediately because of how happy she was. We worked together to make our room look very aesthetically pleasing and then went shopping together for food and anything else we needed. We laughed and joked around in the next week (it was dedicated to getting to know the campus and people before classes became) and watched movies together all the time. I really liked Addison and thought this is was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. Little did I know what was to come.
      I started to find myself ticked off by certain habits she had developed. For instance, when we went shopping together, she would often call her mother, to ask her opinions on things and talk about what she bought. I would be fine with this except she did it so often I would just walk silently beside her because I respected her phone calls. Addison told me her mom was her best friend and she told her mom everything, I was just under the impression that when you go out and do something with someone you try not to be on the phone with someone else. I understand for certain things, but not all the time. She did it while in the car with me, and especially in the dorm while I was there.
     Another thing about me is that I am very extroverted and introverted. This means that I enjoy hanging out and talking to people, but I also need some time for myself. Sometimes I will go to a coffee shop in town and read and drink a latte. Addison however whenever I got back in the dorm, would get upset at me for doing something without her. This also happened when I did things with my other friends on campus. Whenever I didn’t tell her where I was or who I was with she would get angry. She was very passive aggressive and would bring up instances with other girls in our dorm and their roommates and how they invited each-other to events. At first I just thought that maybe she didn’t have that many other close friends and was trying to solidify our relationship. So I started to invite her to things, such as movie night with a group of girls I hung out with. They were inviting some of their own roommates so I thought it was appropriate. Unfortunately, Addison never showed up to any of these events. Ironically, sometimes when she would go out with some of her friends she would almost never ask if I wanted to come and if she did, she always seemed like she would rather not have me there. Because I really don’t want to hang out with someone that doesn’t want me there, I refused her most of the time. 
      One night she decided to tell me about her trauma in her past (I won’t disclose anything personal because I respect her privacy). She told everything and I mean everything. At this point we had only known each other for a week and a half, so I thought that she really trusted me and really valued me as a friend. That was, until I realized she really wanted me to reciprocate by telling her about my past. Another thing about me, I really don’t like sharing about everything in my past, I developed “trust issues” through a series of circumstances, so most of the time I will never give someone the whole story, just bits and pieces. So that’s what I did, don’t get me wrong, I did reveal some pretty deep stuff, but like I said, I had only known her a week and a half, so I wasn’t really comfortable with telling her much. Sherealized this and got a bit upset
     One night I was out late because I was going through something. I talked with my sister about it for a long time, she and I are very close, and I realized I was going to be out very late. I texted Addison and told her this (It was about 12 am) and told her to go to bed without me. I got back to the dorms about 2 am, and I was exhausted. As I walked down the hallway there was Addison sitting outside of our dorm. She looked very distraught. She got up and very haughtily told me how she locked herself out of the room. Now she never told me this through text or else I would have come back immediately, instead she looked upset but said that it wasn’t my fault and swung open the door as I swiped my card. She then got up into bed and started ranting. She told me that whatever I was going through I needed to tell someone (subtly implying telling her) and that I shouldn’t be out so late. She said she was so worried about me. I kind of just stood there as she ranted to me, I had kind of gone through an emotionally rollercoaster and was very tired. At this point I was very conflicted. I was upset that she acted like my mom about my actions and really wanted to push me to tell her things. At the same time I couldn’t tell if she was just trying to be nice and actually cared about me.
     Me and Addison were also part of a friend group including two of our other dorm mates in the room next to us. Lily (19F) and Olivia (19F) (their real names disclosed for obvious reasons) were both good friends with me and Addison. I loved both of them very much and I would often hang with them one on one. However, anytime we hung out as a group, Addison seemed to want to exclude me and got upset when one of them would really get into a conversation with me. She seemed upset when all of us decided to hang out together, especially because Addison was close with Lily. Whenever I talked to Lily one on one she would get annoyed.
     About the second week at college, she started to act strange. She stopped being energetic around me but still was that way around other people, especially Lily. She was annoyed any time I was in the dorm when she came back. I would sometimes ask her about her day, her classes, and what she had going on. She would always give very bland answers. I just thought that maybe she was tired and didn’t want to talk when she got back to the dorm. Later on she told me however that she thought I was acting like her mother and she didn’t appreciate it. I guess I decided she needed space and backed away. I had different friends in my other classes and really started hanging with them more. One time when I went to the restroom, I overheard her talking badly about me to Lily. I was very hurt by this, but I understand that getting used to living with someone is difficult.
    The next day I went to a local boutique and bought Addison some nice cute earrings. One of my love languages is gift giving so I thought this would help her feel better about me and potentially open up about what I was doing wrong. She was happy when she saw the gift but she quickly dismissed it and left the dorm to go out with her friends. Now these were $30 earrings so I was a little hurt.
      When we first agreed to live together, Addison and I decided to always ask before we let other people into our dorm. It was a mutual decision because we respected each other's privacy. Addison unfortunately has the habit of bringing people into the dorm without texting me first. I would be totally ok with this if we were on good terms but now that there was some sort of disconnect, I was very annoyed. For instance, one night she invited her friend to play roblox with her and asked me if it was ok after having the other girl already in the room. I said it was ok because I thought that they would mind their own business but instead Addison sat down in my comfy chair and played with this girl for about two hours while talking to each other across the room. I just wish she would’ve told me beforehand.
     Now this brings me to food. At first in the first week me and Addison had bought food for our dorm to last us a while. We ended up watching many movies together late at night and shared food. I bought popcorn for myself and two boxes of mac and cheese along with some trail mix. She bought much more than me. I am completely comfortable sharing food, but some things I had I was hoping to save for myself later. Granted I didn’t make this completely clear to her, but for two consecutive nights late at night she asked if she could have my mac and cheese and I said yes because we shared a lot of things. It was late at night however and I wasn’t very interested in eating, so when she offered for me to have some, I said “no i’m fine”. After eating all of my food (she ate most of it herself to note), then we decided to address our issues (namely how we both would need to buy our own food from now on).
    One night she texts me very plainly asking if we are going to discuss why I'm mad at her. (at this point I had vaguely mentioned her habit of calling her family and we discussed how she had certain chores she expected of me but didn’t tell me what they were (sink cleaning with dish soap for instance))
Addison: Hey, so I don't know why we can't just get along or what, but it really bothers me... idk what to do at this point bc it's weird just coming home to what feels like a stranger. I don't know what to do anymore,(my name). Idk if it's me. It probably is, but I honestly don't even know at this point, and it's upsetting.
Me: look, idk what happened, but it felt like you were mad a me for something the last few days so i decided to give you space. you seem to not want to talk to me anytime i try tho so idk what to do. just tell me what i did wrong really bc whatever it is ill do better. i don't want to be a stranger to you but it feels like you don't want me around.
Addison: (my name) seriously you have to get it out of your head that I'm mad, I feel like you aren't being your true self with me and it seems as if you don't want to talk with me. I get we don't have classes together, and that's okay, but you seriously need to just trust me that I'm not upset. I just think we are very different people, and I believe we have things in common. We just need to both be happy to see one another. Also, I do feel weird calling my family in front of you bc you don't like that, so that is something I should just put out there, and if at any moment you need me to talk outside of the room I can
Me: no, i really don't mind you calling your parents, but i always hear more about you from your conversations with them than from you in person. i want to get a long with you and for both of us to hang out outside of class. if you feel like i'm not being myself it's bc i feel like i cant rn, like there's some barrier, and if that's the case and you really just need space i get it, if it's chores then lets talk about a system. i've been avoiding being in the room altogether bc ive been scared to see you bc ig it feels like you're distant. i wish i could believe you that ur not upset, but i just don't know.
Addison: Well, you avoiding the room was hurtful. You act like I'm such a monster, and you don't want to be around me. You just said you have a barrier up. Trust me, I noticed, so I can't just be myself with someone who doesn't even try to put their barriers down in the first place. Literally just ask me if I'm upset. Most times, I'm busy, (my name), like you are making assumptions about me, and you don't even know me. I don't understand why you see me that way, I don't understand why you precive me that way, but I can't force you to change your mind I'm trying, we hung out all weekend and I thought it was good, then you stopped talking to me and telling me where you are and basically just stopped caring.
Me: Look, maybe we should talk about this together later today, how about over dinner? i'm not trying to act like you're a monster at all, in fact i really like you as a friend and a roommate, and i didn't put up a barrier, i just think that both of us are dealing with an unspoken problem, potentially with eachother, that we aren't voicing and thus both of us appear to be pushing eachother away. i'm sorry if im making assumptions like i don't know you, im sorry if you think i don't care bc those aren't at all the reasons. im trying to figure out what our problems are and work them out, but really we just need to talk face to face about it.
Addison: If you were trying, you wouldn't be making assumptions. I don't feel comfortable having dinner with you, we can talk about this in the room when we are both free, but as of rn I'm just very perplexed by everything you have said, and I need some time to be around people who actually want to be around me. I'm sorry, but I don't want to have dinner today.
We did end up having that conversation later in the week and it went fairly poorly. Most of it consisted of her ranting to me and me not being able to speak at all. She started crying and told me that the fact that I wasn’t crying meant that I didn’t care. She justified calling her parents so much I just gave up on the subject because obviously she really was attached to her parents and didn’t understand how being on a private phone with someone else in the room was rude. (mind you I call my parents, but I do it when she isn’t around and we aren’t hanging out together) She verbally made it clear that she was upset that I thought there was a disconnect and that I wasn’t trying to fix it. She told me that I was treating her like a “monster”. I really do like Addison, and my problem here is I can’t tell if I’m overreacting and she’s doing nothing wrong or if I’m crazy and I’m the problem. She basically never really let me talk, then immediately got into logistics. She told me we were going to buy our food (conveniently after finishing all of mine). She said she wasn’t to going to the same church as me and justified it by saying she really wanted to continue to explore different options (last week she told me she had found a perfect home there). She made it very clear that she wanted to separate from me completely. I sat and listened.
   In the weeks to follow I tried to do better with her requests. I cleaned more and never touched her things. I avoided the room because I really didn’t want to be in the same place as her. I went to my RA and told her about the situation and she suggested I make a roommate contract with Addison. I still didn’t know what to do because many of her habits she didn’t change and she still didn’t talk to me very much and acted annoyed with my presence on social situations. I basically decided to stop hanging out with her entirely and quite literally took separating to heart.
      I’ve lived with her for about a month and a half now. I’ve dealt with all of this but I really don’t want to anymore. I really don’t want to be upset at her. I just stopped really being around her or in the room in general. Maybe I am doing exactly what she meant when she said I was “putting up a barrier”. Maybe she actually just cares about me and the fact that I'm avoiding her now is hurting the situation more than helping. But really, I just don’t want to be around her anymore. ATIA for becoming distant with her because I feel like she is hypocritical and passive aggressive with me?

I've been diagnosed with Inattentive type ADHD, and I was prescribed Adderall for it pretty recently, about a month ago. However, for years I've drank coffee on and off to self-medicate before I even knew I had ADHD, and it really helps, always has, so I wanted to try stimulant medication.

Basically, Adderall still doesn't help me nearly as much as caffeine does. I've tried 5mg daily, 10 mg, 20 mg of Adderall but all it gives me is a short burst of energy, and heart palpitations for the rest of the duration. Caffeine makes me feel so much calmer, more focused, and more motivated.

So my question is, why is that? Is there another med other than Adderall that has a similar effect to caffeine? Should I take caffeine pills? Has anyone had a similar experience to mine? Any advice is valuable to me.

TLDR: Coffee affects me more than Adderall so why is this, and what should I do? ",29,1728177929.0,ADHD,40,1.0,False

Unexpectedly saw him again that same week, and he sat almost next to me (1 seat between us), but I don’t know if that was intentional or if it’s just coincidence. I accidentally dropped my keys in the inbetween seat and as I quickly grabbed them and said sorry he turned and smiled.

Since then, I've been able to sleep normally for the most part, my doctor repeated the blood work and my TSH rose to 4.5. I was also sick with a infection during the blood draw.

Since being on the medication, I've continued to have extreme coldness in my hands and feet. Even laying under the heated blanket doesn't bring my body to a comfortable temperature.

But just in case you ever feel like life is too slow (sarcasm!) between Halloween and American Thanksgiving, I was just looking at my calendar and was reminded World Kindness Day falls right between them! It’s Monday, November 13.

If you’re an organized person, maybe you have some free time and can organize some sort of volunteer event or an activity for that day. 

We’re cheating a little bit around here; we already have a couple of things going on the weekend before so I’m counting them! A few neighbors have gotten together to organize a community kitchen and it’s grand opening is Saturday the 11th, and my building organizes a free outdoor movie theater (a giant white sheet and a projector and speakers, and some chairs & blankets!) every two months, Saturday is PG-13 movie and Sunday is a G-rated, and we scheduled them for November 11th & 12th. 

Are you going to do anything for WKD? What are you thinking about?

When I was looking for info about WKD, I found this poster, and I thought some of you might be interested in some ideas for how to incorporate #s 1-7:

1. Send a text to a loved one. Ex: Every day on my way to work, I scroll through my texts and find one person I haven’t texted in at least a month and just send a “Hi! I’ve been thinking about you, hope you’re well!” Nobody has to know it’s part of my routine, & especially for some of my older family members, it makes their whole week.

2. Let people merge in traffic. Ex: Um, I live in an urban area and honestly it’s better if I don’t drive; kindness isn’t necessarily patience…I leave my car home and walk or ride my bike when I have time and the weather is good (kind to my body & the planet), I take taxis and Ubers & tip well, & when I ride the city bus & metro I try to find discreet ways to be anonymously kind, leave a pass with fare on a seat, stay standing so not just the elderly but *anyone* can have a seat (& I can skip arm day at the gym), etc

3. Intentional moments of kindness throughout the day: Ex: A weird thing I do *every day* is that I visit the cemetery. My husband passed in 2023 and it’s not out of the way bc I intentionally chose a cemetery for him in the middle of the city and I changed my gym membership to one right next to it. 

Every single day, I buy flowers from the vendors outside the entrance, and I leave some at long forgotten graves on the way to see my husband, drop some cat food for the cemetery cats, & leave flowers for my husband. If it’s a day I don’t something I have to rush off to, I’ll take grave-friendly cleaning products and clean an old abandoned grave and/or the graves near my husband. The cemetery workers and the families love it; I thought it was anonymous but cemetery workers must have seen it and told people, bc sometimes I’ll get thank you notes on my husband’s tombstone, and *that* makes me happy for days and days until I get another. 

4. Break out of your comfort zone: Ex: This is dorky but I took an old backpack of one of kids, this bright glittery turquoise thing with hearts all over it, & I christened it the Joy Backpack. I fill it with all kinds of stuff people I come across throughout the day might need. Change for people without homes, snacks and water too. Cheap ponchos and hand warmers. Hand sanitizer, sunscreen, toiletry kits for people without homes, toilet paper & sanitary products, chargers, coloring books-crayons-cheap toys for screaming kids at restaurants…all kinds of stuff. 

Another thing I like to do? I’m every day either a very early riser or very very night owl, and one of the things I love to do is while it’s still quiet outside, once or twice a week before the sun is up and people are out, I like to take a solo drive and leave flowers at some of the makeshift memorials around town where people have put crosses and other items out for family members or friends who have died. I don’t know ‘em but their offerings get a little wilted and gray after awhile so I love the idea of their loved ones driving by and seeing that someone is remembering their family member. 

5. Compliments: Ex: well this is my favorite part. I’ll compliment everyone. I love your hair and your shoes, your dress, your sweater, your laugh, that stupid joke I’m pretending is hilarious. It makes me happy to compliment people and say good morning and good evening to *everyone*.

6. Reach out to family: Some of my kids are grown now, and I have grandkids who are starting to get old enough to have their own cell phones. I text my kids & grandkids *every day*, and my dad & stepmom, my siblings too. Other family members go on rotation but I definitely reach out to these guys every day. If I’m being honest it’s a broadcast message I send out to all of them at the same time. What? They don’t have to know! 

7. Treat someone to coffee: I think the whole “buy someone a coffee” thing every day is boring. And I love coffee! But where I live people pop in and out to visit all day so I keep coffee and soup warm all day and my kids and I love to bake so we always have breads and baked goods ready to go too. And if there is an unhoused person outside of a coffee shop or store I go into I’ll always grab something to go for them & pass it on. (Where I live there are a lot of unhoused people.)

If you have been following my previous posts, you know the last succubus encounter, or celestial entity as some prefer to refer to it happened on January 2nd, 2024.  That doesn't mean I've not had other encounters since then - I have.  I can't report every encounter. I wouldn’t have a life.  Therefore, I had to come up with rules as to what I share vs. what I forever must keep to myself.   To help me through this journey - this decision-making process - I’ve decided to share online (with you) encounters I have a decent memory of.  These encounters are extremely hard to remember - very difficult for me to grasp - for the simple fact once I wake up p00f whatever just happened to me while sleeping is gone.  All that is left are just bits and fragments.   I never knew the human brain could ache until I started experiencing this stuff.  I'm talking about the ethereal, celestial visits.  Why ethereal?  Why celestial?  What else could they be?  Before I go into detail about the encounter I experienced on October 4th, 2024, I need to explain a few things.  I want to provide the reader with some important facts.  Give you an update on where I am with my life. 

I'm in a relationship now. I have a girlfriend. My first major relationship since Tina (See The Bothell Hell House). These succubus visits began a few months after I moved out of the Bothell house and never really subsided. Not until November, or December 2023.  That’s when my relationship began.  The few people I confided in about these visits, which are extremely sexual, amongst other things were looking for ways to make it stop. Some still are.  *Isn't the torment me and Tina experienced for four years in the Bothell Hell House enough?*  I believe so. Evidently not these entities.    But like I mentioned earlier these visits began to subside to the point of not happening at all around the time frame my now girlfriend and I got together and by together, I mean the time frame we began having sex - in my bed.  Succubus 'will not approach a bed that's duly occupied by a mate or partner.  That’s a huge no, no in their world.'  And so, for the majority of 2024, I've not been visited in my place of residence.  The key word is my place of residence.  I have had succubus-esque visits elsewhere e.g., the Jan 2nd incident.   I have had succubus-esque visits while traveling to see family and friends.  I think we can agree a Hotel room is nowhere near as sacred as one’s bedroom.  A bedroom where a relationship was officially consummated has high significance in the spirit world.   More so when that significant partner lives with you say three weeks. Or visits you quite often.  So why now?  If the visits have subsided (and they did) why now?  Why are they picking up again?  Well, my girlfriend doesn't live here. She lives in South America.  We formed a relationship while she was here for work-related stuff during the summer, fall, and winter of 2023.  And even when she went back home the succubus visits didn't immediately return to my bedroom.  My girlfriends left in March 2024 the succubus didn’t begin reappearing in my home till late July - August.   Which makes me believe the energy we created together while she was here has subsided (but our love has not).  We're still together.  But I'm talking about energy.   Someone reading this can explain this better than me but I'm going to try my best to articulate my theory or belief as to what's happening.    Whatever energy (invisible barrier) my girlfriend and I created and put together while she was here due to time apart has subsided.  Either that or the succubus has found a loophole in the succubus etiquette handbook.  Based on my conversations with them (they do 90% of the talking telepathically) I believe them returning to my bedroom at night is because my and my girlfriend's energy barrier has subsided.   At the core of this theory of mine is the telepathic conversation the succubus had with me when I moved to my second place of residence after the Bothell house.

To the best of my knowledge, I have to emphasize that because I may have had other visits to my bedroom after my girlfriend went back to South America and I just don’t remember.  For the simple fact the encounters I do remember are extremely hard to piece together.  Extremely hard to recollect after the fact.  Unless an in-depth conversation (telepathically) takes place or an encounter that involves my other human senses like touch, smell, and hearing, it's extremely difficult to remember an encounter tooth and nail.  I learned today and this bugged me for quite some time why can't I ever see the end?  I can see them arriving. I see them mounting me, making small talk, some laugh and giggle, some just get straight to the point, some provide brute honesty, answers that cut like a knife. I see and remember all of those things.  I can see and remember being mounted. I feel and remember them putting my manhood inside them.  What I can't remember.  Regardless of how much stimuli or human senses are being utilized is the end.   The last thing I see, and feel is them riding and the camera fading into black.  Pitch blackness overtakes.  What happens after that is what you see in the movies. I open my eyes slowly; I'm lying on my back and what I see is the ceiling.  It’s the most peaceful wake-up ever.    Remember when Frodo woke up at the very end of Lord of the Rings (Part One and Part Three) the level of peace on his face? The moment his eyes opened.  Everything is so calm. So quiet. I mean quiet as if I'm the only person on Earth.  I kid you not the first thought in my head is what just happened?  When it comes to ethereal visits both otherworldly and Zen in my opinion are two sides of the same coin.  The succubus after they've had their way with me leave me in the most peaceful state imaginable. Some might not like that. I don't like it.  But it's true.  Long gone are the days when I wake up feeling like I drank a gallon of high-caffeinated coffee. Is the sense of euphoria still present? Yes, euphoria is still present. Euphoria on steroids.  But something new has emerged.  Based on this encounter I confirmed two things.  Communication via telepathy might be on purpose.  It seems to prevent me from remembering conversations in detail.   Google search says that telepathy 'is the idea that information can be transmitted from one person's mind to another without the use of physical interaction or known sensory channels. It's a form of extrasensory perception.  The idea is that information can be transmitted from one person's mind to another without using physical interaction I believe hinders my ability to remember everything that happens to me.   Throw on top of that me falling asleep minutes after the fun begins and you can (I hope) understand why recounting everything I've experienced is so extremely difficult.  It's worth saying the succubus is not there to provide me with a good time.  They are not there to give me sex imaginable.  There they're in my opinion to satisfy their nympho desires and propagate their species.  It’s also fair to say the succubus and all entities for that matter good and bad are not visiting me to prove to the world that they exist.   These encounters are extremely intimate. Extremely personal and if you listen and read carefully provides a lot of information. 

I've not been able to quantify the length of these encounters. I assume time moves differently in the ethereal world vs the physical world we live in.   I've had two surgeries in my life.  One was to re-attach a patella tendon.  From the time I was given anesthesia to the time I woke up in the recovery room was four hours.  For me?  It felt like twenty-odd seconds.  One second, I'm counting backward, the next second I'm waking up in a recovery room feeling groggy.  That’s my experience with surgeries.   These ethereal encounters feel similar. I wanted to tell you things before telling my story.  Now let me tell you what happened.

**October 4th, 2024** - I'm no sleep expert but if I had to guess I would say the Oct 4th, 6:00 AM event took place between NREM Stage N1 and REM Stage R phases of sleep.  5 AM is the usual time I wake up on weekdays but this particular morning the rain was coming down pretty good outside.  Nothing soothes me more than the sound of the Pacific Northwest rain in both fall and wintertime. It’s for that reason alone I decided to stay in bed longer - steal a few extra winks of sleep if you will.  So, I'm lying in bed, in pitch blackness waiting for the sleep to consume me once more and it does.  NOTE: things are always happening around me before going to sleep.  Sheet tugs, mattress indentations, the feeling of being watched, bed nudging, the feeling of someone - something circling the perimeter of the bed, and the occasional bed squeaking sounds.   These activities I describe in detail in my second book have never subsided. Some nights or mornings are better than others, but they've never gone away.  I told my girlfriend a few weeks before today’s event that the activity I just described (sheet tugging, gnawing on my feet, the pokes and prodding, and mattress indentations) had increased tremendously.  As I'm going in and out of sleep I feel these things.  I feel a presence. Eight years ago, when all of this began my first instinct would be to get up.  Get up and start my day.  Not anymore.   I'm tired. It’s raining beautifully outside, and I need my sleep. An extra two hours of sleep would be golden.  I feel my eyes getting heavy and that’s when I instinctively turn towards laying partially on my left side.  I'm in a position where I'm lying half on my back and half on my left side. As soon as I turn to get into that position that’s when it happens.   I hear and feel an enormous amount of movement coming from the right side of the bed.  At the side of the bed, I just turned my back towards.  Something climbs over me.  That’s right, someone is climbing over me.  I know this encounter very well.  I've experienced it multiple times.  No matter how many times I experience it. It never gets old.   What does it feel like? Imagine a child climbing over his mom and dad just so he or she could get to the middle of the bed.  That’s what it feels like.  All the sensations you feel because of your child climbing over you to get to the middle of the bed I'm feeling right now.   The mattress lowers because of the extra weight entering the bed.  The bed vibrates, shakes, and makes its normal squeaking sounds until finally it stops and whatever it was that climbed over is now comfortably resting in the middle of the bed.  We're facing each other.  Two things I remember as I'm being climbed on.  An arm running and draping seductively across my upper body as the rest of the body goes across.   The next thing I remember as this body mass comes to rest in the middle of the bed are the words 'Hi baby, …(pause)………..Keith.'  It wasn’t the words or hearing my name uttered that startled me.  I experienced those countless times already.  No, it was the level of excitement.  I was able to deduce instantly from that level of excitement and energy this entity had been waiting to see me - was excited I was in the position for which she or it could reveal itself.   What do I mean exactly?  When these encounters originally began, they seemed to happen when I slept on my back.  Which I hardly do.  I took comfort in knowing to limit these encounters all I must do is avoid sleeping on my back.  Easier said than done - but I can manage it.  Over time that became less and less of a preventative method.  Every succubus encounter I've had for a year or so involves me either sleeping half on my back and half on my side and my back entirely.   How do I know these entities can only get what they want from me by me being on my back or being halfway on my side and back?  They've told me.

In the past, I've heard the most beautiful angelic voice utter the words 'turn over' while I'm sleeping.  Sometimes I oblige.  Sometimes I don't.  Half the time I don't even know I'm obliging.  These commands come in the middle of a dream -probably in Stage R of REM sleep.  But I digress This succubus that just climbed over me, flopped in the middle of my bed looking dead at me begins talking to me.  By talking I mean it or she is communicating to me telepathically.  And this is where it gets interesting - this is where I get upset.  With myself.  I'm pretty sure I could hear and understand everything she was saying in real-time. I just can't remember it now. Now I remember bits and pieces.  And that’s probably by design.  What I do remember is her appearance (see below) and the conversation we're having.  It's a short and tort conversation.  I can't remember the conversation exactly but based on what she does next I'm going to assume it has to do with her appearance.  I was put off by her appearance to the point where I believed she asked me 'Would I like her better if she changed?' I must have thought yes because within a few seconds of asking me 'Would I like her better if she changed?'  She did just that.  She changed.  This hideous petite-looking thing in the middle of me levitates midair off the bed. Comes to a complete stop midair between my bed and ceiling.  What was once a humanoid figure is now a floating black mass.  A floating black mass that’s going through multiple physical changes.  Finally, the black mass is gone.  It disappears.  What's in my bed now is a beautiful woman.  This beautiful woman a cross between actresses Penelope Cruz and Kerry Washington in appearance is now riding me cowgirl and reverse cowgirl.  I remember her thrusts vividly, her back-and-forth motions while riding me while facing away.  As if to make sure I was enjoying what she was doing she more than once turned her face partially back towards me with the most satisfactory yes which I took as both 'thank you.'  Suddenly, the room begins fading black.  All I remember is her riding me as I fall to sleep.  A sleep I'm sure she initiated.  P00F!  I wake up like I always do. I begin taking stock of my surroundings.  Is it still raining outside?  Yes.  Do I still have all my faculties?  Do I still have all my limbs?  Am I still alive?  I am.   There I am lying on my back.  The environment is serene.  I feel like I'm the only human being on Earth.  Euphoria and peace are subsiding.  That Zen I talked about earlier is slowly dissipating. I then realized what just happened. I was visited.  Ok, what now?  Nothing ladies and gentlemen.  Time to get up and start my day.  Time to go to work.  Time to go to my 9:30 AM dermatologist’s appointment.",0,1728176642.0,ParanormalEncounters,1,0.4,False

In the past, I've heard the most beautiful angelic voice utter the words 'turn over' while I'm sleeping.  Sometimes I oblige.  Sometimes I don't.  Half the time I don't even know I'm obliging.  These commands come in the middle of a dream -probably in Stage R of REM sleep.  But I digress This succubus that just climbed over me, flopped in the middle of my bed looking dead at me begins talking to me.  By talking I mean it or she is communicating to me telepathically.  And this is where it gets interesting - this is where I get upset.  With myself.  I'm pretty sure I could hear and understand everything she was saying in real-time. I just can't remember it now. Now I remember bits and pieces.  And that’s probably by design.  What I do remember is her appearance (see below) and the conversation we're having.  It's a short and tort conversation.  I can't remember the conversation exactly but based on what she does next I'm going to assume it has to do with her appearance.  I was put off by her appearance to the point where I believed she asked me 'Would I like her better if she changed?' I must have thought yes because within a few seconds of asking me 'Would I like her better if she changed?'  She did just that.  She changed.  This hideous petite-looking thing in the middle of me levitates midair off the bed. Comes to a complete stop midair between my bed and ceiling.  What was once a humanoid figure is now a floating black mass.  A floating black mass that’s going through multiple physical changes.  Finally, the black mass is gone.  It disappears.  What's in my bed now is a beautiful woman.  This beautiful woman a cross between actresses Penelope Cruz and Kerry Washington in appearance is now riding me cowgirl and reverse cowgirl.  I remember her thrusts vividly, her back-and-forth motions while riding me while facing away.  As if to make sure I was enjoying what she was doing she more than once turned her face partially back towards me with the most satisfactory yes which I took as both 'thank you.'  Suddenly, the room begins fading black.  All I remember is her riding me as I fall to sleep.  A sleep I'm sure she initiated.  P00F!  I wake up like I always do. I begin taking stock of my surroundings.  Is it still raining outside?  Yes.  Do I still have all my faculties?  Do I still have all my limbs?  Am I still alive?  I am.   There I am lying on my back.  The environment is serene.  I feel like I'm the only human being on Earth.  Euphoria and peace are subsiding.  That Zen I talked about earlier is slowly dissipating. I then realized what just happened. I was visited.  Ok, what now?  Nothing ladies and gentlemen.  Time to get up and start my day.  Time to go to work.  Time to go to my 9:30 AM dermatologist’s appointment.",2,1728176458.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False

1fx4zay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Morocco/comments/1fx4zay/why_dont_we_tell_the_donkey_that_its_a_donkey/,Why don’t we tell the donkey that it’s a donkey?,"Watching a scene in a foreign TV show, an old man is sitting, drinking coffee, and watching TV. He’s not doing anything important when someone knocks on his door, he gets up lazily and opens it, it was one of his friends. He asked him with surprise: Sami! Is everything okay? His friend replied: Yes, everything’s fine. Sorry, I came without notice. Can I come in? The old man replied with an apology and said: Actually, you can’t come in. I had an exhausting day and I need some peace. You should have called before coming. Maybe you can visit me at the end of the week. The friend replied with understanding, apologized again and left…

I remember this scene on Sunday morning at eight. The alarm woke me at seven, then I remembered that it’s Sunday, I can sleep until noon, I happily went back to sleep. I woke up again to a light knocking on our door. It’s eight in the morning, everyone is asleep, everyone is tired after a week of studying or working. I think I’m the only one who heard the knocking. Whoever this person is, their importance isn’t greater than my sleeping until noon. I won’t open the door. The more they waited, the louder the knocking got, and more persistent, to the point where I thought it might be the house owner coming angrily because we were late with the rent, only to remember that the house is ours.
Someone gave up their sleep to see who’s knocking on the door like that at eight in the morning, at this time, and with this kind of knocking, they must be needing something important. 
They opened the door, and a voice mixed with laughter said: I woke you up?
Clearly, she wasn’t serious with her question after all that knocking. She’s a member of our family, coming from some village.

Here, I remembered the scene from the movie and I thought, could I go and refuse to let her in as the old man did with his friend, Could I say: You can’t visit us without notice, especially not at eight in the morning on a Sunday? I can’t do or say any of that because our customs prevent us from doing it, our education prevents us from speaking the truth and pushes us to hide our anger behind a fake smile, just to avoid appearing impolite despite their disrespect for personal space and comfort. And I still wonder, as Dostoevsky did: Why are we so excessive in our politeness? Why don’t we simply tell the donkey that it’s a donkey?

I am now in the group of those dealing with this for years, but fortunately again not dealing with the most severe of symptoms. This is kinda of a misery loves company type post - every single day is a day of moments that just layer upon themselves. I wake up and have morning coffee, walk the dog, hop in the car and drop my dog off at daycare, get home and start to work, go pick up food at lunch, work day ends and I get the dog, then do the nighttime routine. Every single one of those events is singular in time and moments in my memory, it isnt a 'day' because of DPDR, they are just events happening to me that I have to remind myself of while fighting off an anxiety attack at any moment. It's Saturday and I can remember my entire day, but in my mind it wasnt a 'day' but moments. Every single big thing in my life that has happened the last 3 years is remembered this way in my mind. 

Also - I want to thank this group so much for how much you've helped me. By no means want to generalize and mansplain, but as a guy dealing with this it's been an absolute struggle feeling like I am on my own and cant speak to anyone. ",2,1728176317.0,dpdr,4,1.0,False
