Lady- I’ll take a grande iced brown sugar shaken espresso, very light ice. 
Me- ok do you want extra milk in that or do you want room in the cup
Lady- what? Just light ice 
Me- yea, with less ice there is going to be a gap, do you want more milk in that or the room on top. 
Lady- I guess more milk 
(Lady gets to the window) 
Lady- I didn’t understand your question 
Me- sometimes people want light ice, but still want the strong espresso taste, so they would have room on top.
Lady- oh I want more of a coffee taste, not milk. But I want more drink. Last time I got it, it was mostly ice.
Me- so to achieve more of a coffee taste, and have more drink without having to add more milk, you will need to order additional shots of espresso. As the drink is just shots of espresso, syrup and cinnamon shaken together and then topped off with milk. You could also order the drink extra shaken as it will melt the ice more and you will have more “drink”. 
Lady- looks at me confused and drives away.

Whether placed on a side table, office desk, or nightstand, a perfect table clock brings together **functionality** and **aesthetic appeal**, creating a harmonious atmosphere in any room. If you’re looking to elevate your space, here are some compelling reasons why a table clock should be your next décor investment.

# 1. Practical and Stylish Timekeeping

First and foremost, a table clock serves a **functional purpose**—keeping you on time. Unlike digital clocks, which often lack character, a traditional table clock provides a sense of **charm** and **nostalgia** while serving its primary role. Whether you need to manage your daily schedule or simply appreciate the art of **analog timekeeping**, a well-designed table clock brings a timeless appeal to your home.

Moreover, a table clock can fit perfectly into smaller spaces, sitting neatly on desks, shelves, or tables without taking up too much room. Its compact size makes it an ideal piece for any setting, offering a practical solution to your time-telling needs.

# 2. Adds Character and Sophistication to Any Room

One of the standout features of a table clock is its **ability to enhance a room’s overall décor**. It is a statement piece that can add character and sophistication to any corner of your home. Whether you prefer an elegant vintage design with intricate detailing or a sleek, minimalist model, table clocks come in a wide variety of styles.

A well-chosen clock can bring cohesion to your room, blending seamlessly with the other elements of your décor. Placing a table clock in your living room or study gives it a polished, well-rounded look, instantly boosting the space’s style quotient. Whether your interior design is **modern**, **classic**, or **eclectic**, the perfect table clock will complement and elevate the aesthetic of the room.

# 3. A Conversation Starter

A beautifully designed table clock often becomes a **conversation starter**. Its unique design, craftsmanship, and functionality can easily spark discussions among your guests, making it an engaging focal point. Whether you go for an **art-deco design**, **vintage brass finish**, or a **modern geometric shape**, table clocks offer plenty of visual appeal that piques curiosity.

A distinctive table clock can also serve as a reflection of your personal taste and style, allowing your guests to glimpse your preferences in home décor. So, not only is it a functional item, but it also offers a peek into your personality.

# 4. Versatility for Different Settings

One of the biggest advantages of table clocks is their **versatility**. They fit well in a variety of settings, from the office to the bedroom, and even as part of a coffee table display.

* **Office or study:** A stylish clock on your desk adds a sense of order while keeping you mindful of time during your workday.
* **Living room:** A table clock enhances the beauty of your coffee table or side tables, complementing your other decorative accents.
* **Bedroom:** A smaller, elegant clock can serve as a charming nightstand accessory while providing a functional way to keep track of time as you start and end your day.

# 5. Emotional and Sentimental Value

Table clocks often become much more than just timepieces. They can hold **sentimental value**, representing special moments or milestones in your life. Whether it’s an anniversary gift, a family heirloom, or a collectible piece, a table clock can carry meaning beyond its functionality.

Some table clocks even come with personalized engravings or designs that make them perfect for celebrating life’s most important occasions. Over time, these clocks become cherished memories, adding emotional value to your home décor.

# Final Thoughts

The perfect table clock is a delightful combination of **function** and **aesthetic appeal**. It’s not just a time-teller but also a statement piece that enhances the beauty of your home, reflects your personal style, and serves as a source of conversation. From **traditional analog designs** to **modern, sleek models**, a table clock is a versatile addition to any room, making it an investment that brings both practical and emotional value.

So, if you’re looking to refresh your space with a new piece that marries style and function, consider the timeless appeal of a table clock.",1,1738872345.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

Pulled some decent shots since, but today I also swapped the shower screen for the IMS GA200NT Nano and noticed something weird with the water flow (see attached video). Looks like part of the water is channeling from the top of the shower plate holder, which didn’t seem right.

https://reddit.com/link/1ijbs9h/video/vjkpe9t0rkhe1/player

After some investigating, I think this holder might not be the right fit for my machine—it seems like it should have an edge all around to ensure a proper seal, like the original one did. Right now, there’s likely a gap all around. Lesson learned! Just because something says ""Suitable for Gaggia Classic"" doesn’t mean it works for every model.

Seems like this one would’ve been the better choice:

I know that Sedna Woo had an ADHD spell, but that didn't work for me.

I should mention that I'm already medicated for ADHD but I still end up having to drink an insane amount of coffee and energy drinks.

I tried everything mundane for productivity and self care!

I tried drinking more water, exercise, meditation, EFT tapping, game-like productivity apps, etc...

I am thinking of including the following:

\* Black tourmaline and hematite (good for concentration)

\* Blue candle for calm and focus

\* Maybe some symbol of sigil for the word ""FOCUS""

\* Focus frequency music

However, I am probably going to even forget that I did this soon enough because of my ADHD.

I am wondering if it makes more sense to put some focused energy into a container of some sort so that it always helps me focus....maybe my water bottle? So when I sip water from it, I remember to focus and to practice self care that helps me focus?

I have my water bottle right beside me always when I am at home or work or wherever, so maybe that makes sense, and then I'll just use the blue candle and the other stuff to raise energy and focus it?

Hi folks,

Our first apartment (yay!) is nearing completion, and now comes the task of arranging, and decorating the place. 

We are pondering what to do on our dining - living room, which is the first picture. Most of the light will come from the twin window, facing S-ES. At the bottom of the floor plan (pic2) will be an open kitchen. 

We already created a tentative plan, but given our inexperience on decoration and room configuration, we would love some pointers, pieces of advice, and suggestions.

Some points we would like to address :

\- what type / shape for the table and coffee table ? Do you want different shapes or should everything be round or square-ish ? We were also thinking a bar height table, for some contrast with the salon area.

\- are there must have elements for such a room? Rugs, plants, lamps, etc.

\- what sofa and armchair color would be advisable ?

\- any tip or idea regarding the suggested arrangement ?

Thanks in advance !

Rough draft. I think this will be a first chapter of a longer story.","“I couldn’t stop fear from holding me back. I couldn’t control it like most learned too. So I stopped feeling fear altogether.”  The man in the blue suit said. “I got in my own way for sooo long.” He paused for a moment “But now the only thing slowing me down is you…” he stared in silence for a moment. face blank, as if all the words he said meant nothing to him. Except for that last one. Some emotions swirled there, lingering in the air for a moment. 
Finally Jeffrey broke the silence. “Then do something about it”
The crazy man in the tattered blue suit broke into a full sprint directly towards Jeffery. Stone cold poker face, the strangest display of rage Jeffery had ever seen. Jeffery reached to his hip for his weapon, a revolving pistol.
The man dove for Jeffery at the same time. A knife had appeared in his grip. “Got you!” the man yelled, finally showing some emotion. A menacing smile stretched across his face. The knife plunged into Jeffrey’s chest. An explosion of pain. “You know this never was personal, I’m not angry with you Jeff.”  The words barley making it to Jeffrey’s consciousness as the man spoke. “you really aught ta learn to quit while your ahead, don’t get in the way of another mans plans ya know?”
Jeffery heard nothing, only one thought now consumed him. 
Left pocket.
He reached for his left pocket, the man still twisting the knife back and forth in his right lung. Not yet. Jeffery thought. Not.. over. Yet. 
Click.
He was back. Back before all of this started, pain gone. Relief flooded Jeffery. That had been too close. Luckily he was able to jump to another body quickly. He was back but not everything the same. He got up from the couch in the one bedroom apartment. He walked to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. Still Jeffrey I guess. Though he couldn’t quite ignore the outfit he was wearing, a black leather jacket and a black t-shirt with a red skull on its left chest. his hair dyed black and cut short, and ripped up baggy jeans covered his legs. Such an unnatural look for him. Am I goth this time? He shuffled to the bedroom to find himself a better outfit.
As Jeffery got dressed he thought about what happened to the souls -or whatever they were- of the Jeffrey’s bodies he’d taken. He didn’t feel sorry for them. Having your life stripped away without ever feeling or knowing, that sounded like bliss to Jeffrey right about now. He wished he was them. But he knew better than wishes. He had burned through enough of those. He lied down on the bed in the cluttered apartment room. It was time for rest. Not that he needed it physically, this new Jeffrey he occupied was fully rested. Maybe even had a cup of coffee. Not to mention he was much more muscular than the previous Jeffrey. Physically, he was ready for war. But mentally and spiritually, he was drained. And he no longer had the device that directed his soul to the reality nearest to his mission-to the best Jeffrey. If he died now, who knows where his soul thingy would go? Or if it would disperse into a million pieces and return to the ether. Only coming out again in fragments, in a million new souls that had nothing to do with Jeffrey. It was a horrible thought. But he knew if it happened, he would eventually will all the pieces back together like a magnet, over billions or trillions of years. Becoming himself again. Just like the aliens had told him. He was doomed to an eternal battle now. But the war must go on. Without the conflicting energies there would be nothing. Everything being equal also meant nothing existing. A worse thought. It probably took eternities for the strange explosion to happen. The one that  created everything. The war must go on. Who knows if an explosion like that would ever happen again. He must maintain the balance. But first, he needed sleep. 
Jeffrey awoke to a clattering of dishes in the kitchen, just down the short hallway. He was aware this new body of his had to have a weapon somewhere. Most Jeffrey’s did. Most of them. He reached under his pillow. Nothing. He looked under the bed, Nada. He was looking in the far left drawer of his new vessels dresser when he found it. A colt python revolver. He wasn’t sure how old this time. It seemed so old compared to the last time he’d held it. Or this was his first time holding it? All this back and forth between realities was starting to make his brain hurt.
Reluctantly, he made his way to the bedroom door. Another clatter- more gentle this time- sounded from the kitchen just at the end of the hall. The bedroom door lay cracked but not enough to see anything but more hallway. He slowly and silently pushed the door open with his weapon. And made it into the hallway. 
“Jeff is that you?” the words stunned him. It was a woman. Nothing menacing about her tone, only concern lie there. “I thought you were supposed to be working the afternoon shift at the plant? Did they call it off?” her voice soft and gentle as she spoke. 
Jeffery knew she was not a threat, and quickly put his weapon into his waistband. “oh uh, yeah. Sorry I just woke up from a nap. Still a little groggy.” 
“well I’m glad. I’m making dinner, care to join me?”

I’m the father of my 7-year-old son/daughter—a brilliant but mischievous kid. Recently, I was called to the principal’s office because my child decided to rip up another student’s book. After a stern discussion with the principal, I was directed to visit the class teacher’s room for further guidance.

I knocked on her door, and a soft, sweet voice answered, “Yes, please, come in.” I stepped inside with my child, taking a seat at her desk. The moment I saw her, my attention shifted. She was wearing a traditional saree, draped elegantly, and her natural charm was impossible to ignore. Her warm smile and graceful demeanor made it difficult to focus on the reason I was there.

As she began discussing my child’s results and behavior, I found myself less interested in the report card and more captivated by her. It was as if the world slowed down. Then, almost unexpectedly, she looked at me and asked, “Would you like to meet for coffee?”

Her words caught me off guard, but I quickly replied, “Yes, please,” without hesitation.

What could she possibly want to discuss over coffee? Was it about my child—or something more? I couldn’t wait to find out.

1ijbh2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1ijbh2v/landed_first_internship_with_1_application/,Landed First Internship with 1 Application,"This is less of a flex and more of a hopeful post. Just for some background, I'm a 23 year old sophomore and I started my college career in 2020 majoring in marketing and decided to drop out in 2022 because I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. I worked a lot of odd jobs at grocery stores, car dealerships, and even a period of time where I did remote sales for a large advertising company. Absolutely hated that job lol. Ended up quitting and transferring my credits to a CC and finished my associates. At first I wanted to go into investment banking but soon realized how dreadful the job is despite the amazing pay. Decided I wanted to go into tech so I enrolled back into my university as a CS major, which is not a top school at all. At this point I didn't realize how cooked the job market was but honestly I didn't really care that much. My first semester back I connected with an old professor of mine from my 2020 business 101 class. She currently works at Ally Financial as a recruiter so I told her I would apply for the internship this summer. She always saw a lot of potential in me so she pushed me along the recruiting process and put in a good word with the tech recruiter at the company. It was pretty late in the internship cycle so it was this or bust for me tbh. 

Long story short, I was extremely honest and transparent with my journey and the team loved my story. I got the internship at Ally in a week span. Excited and blessed to have this opportunity. 

Moral of the story is if someone like me can get a CS internship then I'm sure you can too. I have zero experience in CS and I've just started learning how to code like 4 months ago. I think the biggest thing a lot of CS majors lack is people skills. I noticed this last semester in some of my intro classes. I've always been somewhat outgoing but I honestly think the 6 months of working sales and calling hundreds of businesses a day taught me how to speak confident, clearly, and articulately. The only thing that comes close to developing this level of proficiency in speaking to others would be Toastmasters. If there is a chapter on campus or in your area I would highly recommend joining a club. 

Another thing I would recommend is building genuine connections. This might sound cringe but reading ""How to Make Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie was surprisingly helpful to me. I wouldn't have landed this internship if it wasn't for my old professor viewing me in a positive manner. The interview process was essentially streamlined just based off of her putting a good word in for me and constantly checking up with the recruiters and hiring managers about my status. When there's someone that genuinely cares about your future inside the company you want to apply to, your chances of getting through the initial screening process dramatically increases. And once you get to the interview, there's a chance someone is just as or slightly qualified than you that is competing for the same internship. But because of your reputation with the person you know within the company, they will most likely extend you the offer instead of the other person. So talk to your professors and build genuine relationships with them. Ask questions in class, present yourself as a leader, and attend office hours. Go to office hours even if you don't need help with anything lol. This also applies to any alumni or employees at whatever company you want to apply to. Reach out through LinkedIn and set up informational interviews and coffee chats with them. Offer to buy them lunch. 

The last thing is personal projects. Like I previously stated, I just started learning how to code in August so I had no experience in computer science prior to this year. I knew that if I wanted to land any kind of internship for the summer I would have to rack up some projects to supplement my learning. First semester was basic programming so I did some extra studying on the side to work on some projects for my resume. I worked on a standard weather app in python, helped my mom with a website in HTML/CSS, and built a Figma prototype of a travel application for a class. I also did a hackathon for LPL Financial a couple of weeks ago where we built a AI-Powered Compliance Bot using AWS. Not much but it was something that I could talk about. 

I honestly feel lucky to even have this opportunity but I'm hoping somebody can be more hopeful in their internship search from this post.

Hi🫶🏼 I’m a 21yo psychology major. I love to read, and tend to get lost in my inner-world A LOT. I’m quite shy and reserved, but I can be very good at socializing. I thrive in one-on-one conversations and tend to withdraw in big groups (but I still listen). I’ve been told that I’m very easy to talk to, and that I have a ‘calm aura’. People usually describe me as bright, kind and warm. 

I rarely leave the house, and my alone time means everything to me. If I do go out, it’s usually to go on campus, the library, the bookstore, Pilates, go for a walk, the museum, a coffee shop, the mall, a restaurant, or the movies. I’m definitely a cat person, and I have an unhealthy obsession with butterflies (which is why I love the first picture so much). 

I grew up as an only child, which might’ve contributed to how stuck in my own head I tend to be lol. I’ve always been very comfortable with being on my own. In high school I wasn’t popular, but I got along with everyone. Teachers loved me and I always got good grades. I would always help others and give them the answers to the homework (though some people definitely took advantage of that bc I can’t say no). 

I’m definitely a people pleaser who tends to put other people’s needs above my own. I avoid upsetting others even if it is at the expense of my own comfort. I have adhd and really bad anxiety. But I’m very good at hiding when I’m struggling. I usually don’t ask for help and just suffer in silence. I would say that I am a lot better at writing about my feelings than talking about them. To cope I find ways to escape reality. I’m the biggest day dreamer ever haha. People assume that I’m always happy and have an easy life, but I struggle a lot (I just don’t let it show). 

I’m definitely artistic. I love trying to find the beauty in everything. I love to paint and draw. I’ve always been interested in art history, but I’m also a big math nerd (or just a nerd in general haha). Math is one of my favourite subjects, but I also love topics like philosophy, literature, psychology, etc. I also love photography, but I hate getting my pictures taken. 

Hopefully this is enough information to make an educated guess! Excited to see what you guys come up with hehe🙃

Apologies in advance for this massive wall of text — I'm including as much detail as I can remember in the hopes that it's helpful to someone else. I'm pretty high-anxiety in general, and it was so nice to be able to read through everyone else's details / get a mental picture for what the surgery and recovery process might be like before I did it myself.

For context: I'm 40 years old, have been married for 10 years, and have no children. This was my first-ever surgery.

**Consultation**

I had an appointment late last year with a nurse practitioner in my OBGYN's office for some pretty terrible period cramps, and she suggested a pelvic ultrasound as a first step. During the ultrasound they discovered an ovarian cyst; my NP said they often recommended surgery to remove it. I had been thinking about sterilization for a while, but this was a good nudge to ask about it — I asked if they could take out my Fallopian tubes at the same time.

She was 100% on board (no questions, no pushback, no second-guessing) and referred me to one of the surgeons in the practice; I set up an appointment for a couple of weeks later (just after the new year).

At that appointment, they did another ultrasound to check on the cyst, and then I met with the doctor, who confirmed she wanted to do surgery to remove it. She explained that the type of cyst they thought it was, based on the ultrasound, may indicate endometriosis, which could explain my cramps. Endometriosis can only be officially diagnosed through surgery, so that's another point in favor of surgery.

My doctor was also completely supportive when I asked about a bisalp. She did mention an IUD at one point, but only in the context of ""this is one treatment for endometriosis, and it's easier from an insurance perspective to have it inserted as birth control pre-surgery instead of trying to get it approved as endo treatment after you've been sterilized,"" and not as an alternative to surgery. When I said I wasn't interested in an IUD she immediately jumped into an overview of what the procedure would look like and how long recovery would be, and mentioned that if she finds endometriosis during the surgery, that opens up a couple of other medication-based treatments for me. She didn't at any point ask about my spouse or question my decision not to have children.

I got a call a couple of days later to schedule my surgery; the wait time between the consult and the surgery ended up being about four weeks.

**Pre-op: weeks before**

I had never had any kind of surgery / been under general anesthesia before, so I was pretty nervous. I was already doing Dry January, so I decided to stick with that because I had heard that avoiding alcohol can make surgery/recovery a bit easier. I've also been experimenting with veganism / trying to eat more protein and fiber, which felt like a nice coincidence. I focused on those things, and on drinking a *lot* more water than normal (I'm chronically dehydrated/usually drink just coffee; I tried to get at least \~40 oz a day, which for me is a lot 😂).

I also made some phone calls:

* to the hospital billing office (as recommended by my doctor), to get an estimate. They estimated a little over $2500 for each surgery, and didn't know anything about the ACA but said their estimates are intended to be maximums / worst-case scenarios
* to my insurance, to get an estimate. The insurance agent quoted me \~$900 for each surgery at first, and then said the bisalp would be covered after I asked about the ACA. I asked for a call reference number. She also said she'd email me a summary; I never got this.
* to the hospital anesthesia billing office, for an estimate. I left a message but never heard back from them.

The anesthesiologist's office called me a week before the surgery to double check what meds I was taking (just oral birth control; they said to keep taking this on schedule) and remind me that I wasn't allowed to eat anything or drink anything non-clear after midnight the day before my surgery, and that I could only have clear fluids up until 2 hours before my arrival time.

I also got a text the Friday night before my Monday surgery with the same information, confirming my arrival and surgery times.

Based on reading through the posts here, I also put together a Google doc with some details, including:

* my scheduled arrival and surgery times
* the ""technical terms"" + layperson's terms for both surgeries (laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy (removal of both Fallopian tubes), plus ovarian cystectomy (the removal of an ovarian cyst on my left side))
* all of the questions I wanted to make sure I had answered before I left the hospital:
   * medication schedule (including for over-the-counter meds)
      * I was prescribed oxy every 6 hours (did not take), 800 mg of ibuprofen every 8 (took, but sometimes skipped a dose/took it more than 8 hours later), Zoltan every 6 as needed (took for \~3 days), and docusate (stool softener) 2x/day as needed (took 4-5 times total).
      * I was also told to take 1000mg of Tylenol every 6 hours as needed (I took this, but sometimes skipped doses/took them later)
   * incision care instructions
      * leave bandaids on for 24 hours, then shower & remove. can replace to avoid clothing irritation. suggested that I remove bandaids entirely after 48-72 hours
   * how long until I can lift weights / go running
      * 2 weeks (exercise walking okay after a week)
   * where should I expect to feel pain/soreness, and for how long?
      * gas pain; maybe some cramping
   * will I have a catheter?
      * no, but they will drain my bladder at the beginning of surgery (see below)
   * how much vaginal bleeding should I expect?
      * light spotting for a few days
   * what symptoms / levels of pain mean I should call the doctor?
      * my aftercare sheet had a very long list of symptoms that indicated I should call
   * when can I shower? take a bath?
      * shower after 24 hours; bath after 2 weeks
   * also: no tampons/penetrative sex/insertion of anything into the vagina for 6 weeks
* a quick summary of my health info (no known allergies; my birth control pills; the date of my last period; no previous surgeries/anesthesia)
* pictures of my insurance cards
* a summary of my call to my health insurance company confirming bisalp is 100% covered under the ACA, plus the call reference number
* the relevant procedure/diagnosis codes for both surgeries

I shared the Google doc with my husband, who's my emergency contact & surgery buddy, in case anyone had questions for him while I was in the OR or in case I was too loopy / out of it after the surgery.

I also bought the following supplies:

* Metamucil fiber gummies with added vitamins C, D, and B12 (so much better/easier to take than the powder)
* Stool softener (docusate) — my doctor ended up prescribing this, so I now I have a lot
* Extra strength Tylenol
* Miralax — I didn't end up taking this
* Cough drops
* GasX — I didn't end up using these; my doctor said it ""may or may not help"" and my gas pain was minimal
* Pads & pantiliners
* Ginger ale
* Nuun (an electrolyte tablet that dissolves in water)
* popsicles and sorbet — I'm 4 days out and still haven't had either of these

**Pre-op: night before**

I showered thoroughly (my doctor didn't recommend any special soap), put freshly washed sheets on my bed, put all my over-the-counter meds / cough drops in a basket, and downloaded the Calm app so I could listen to Cillian Murphy tell me a bedtime story about Ireland. I was feeling pretty anxious over the entire weekend, but some of that anxiety went away the night before — I think because it felt imminent, and I knew I had prepped the best that I could.

I had seen other people mention taking laxatives or drinking special pre-surgery drinks; my doctor did not mention these, so I didn't do anything different with my food/drinks/meds beforehand.

**Pre-op: day of**

I was scheduled to arrive at the hospital at 7:30 AM, for a 9:00 surgery start time. I woke up at 6:30, showered, and got dressed in some soft, seamless underwear, loose joggers with a super high soft wrap-style waist band ([these ones, if you're curious](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=580643042&vid=1#pdp-page-content)), a sports bra that unhooks like a regular bra, a long sleeved Merino hiking shirt (for warmth), and a pullover fleece. I wore thick wool ankle socks and running shoes.

I packed a pad, a pantiliner, a water bottle for after surgery, and a pillow for the car.

We got to the hospital and checked in. I didn't have to pay anything up front. I spent maybe 5 minutes in the waiting room before they called my name. My husband came into the pre-op room with me. The nurse weighed me and asked me to confirm the procedures I was having, and a few more questions about my medications/allergies and the last time I ate/drank anything. I had to pee in a cup (I was *so thirsty* and was afraid nothing would come out since I'd already peed that morning, but I managed to make it work) for a pregnancy test.

I told the nurse that I was feeling a bit nervous, and she said the doctor can prescribe anti-anxiety meds, but they wait to give them to me until after I've spoken with both the surgeon and the anesthesiologist — I wasn't panicky, just a little anxious, so that was okay (and made sense to me).

I was told to remove everything except my socks and change into a gown. I put my clothes/shoes into a special plastic bag the hospital provided (they labeled this with my name and made sure it was in the recovery room for me) and got on the hospital bed. The nurse brought a blanket, and then a second one when I was still cold. She inserted the IV (pretty painless!) and drew some blood through it for final testing before hooking me up to fluids. I also was given some pills to take with a small cup of water: Tylenol for general pain, gabapentin for nerve pain, potentially something for nausea, and potentially something for anti-inflammation, but I can't remember exactly what. It was five pills total, and I know two of them were Tylenol.

My anesthesiologist came in to talk about the process. She asked me to confirm the procedures I was having, explained that she'd have a (nurse? other doctor? I didn't quite catch the person's role) helping her, and stressed that the only thing I would feel in the operating room was a blood pressure cuff squeezing my arm, and then I'd be asleep before anything else happened. She explained that they'd put a tube in my throat to help me breathe, but that I wouldn't be awake for that part.

She asked if I ever got carsick or seasick. I said yes, and she ordered a anti-nausea patch to put behind my ear. I asked about anti-anxiety meds, and she said they can definitely give me some before I go to the OR if I want, after I finish talking to my doctor. She mentioned that they have no effect on the healing/recovery process (not something I had thought to be concerned about, but a good note), and it was totally up to me. She'd said send some in with the nurse so I could have them then if I wanted them.

My doctor came in next, re-confirmed the procedures, and double checked that I was certain about not wanting kids (in a very friendly/routine way, not at all judgmental). I asked my list of questions (having it prepped ahead of time was really helpful because I couldn't remember what was on it). When I asked about a catheter specifically, she said they would drain my bladder (she described this as an ""in and out"" procedure) at the beginning, and then not use a catheter during the rest of the surgery. She said I might experience some minor irritation from this (I did not).

A little later the nurse came back in and mentioned that she had some more things to inject into my IV, including something for anxiety. At this point it was about 15 minutes before my scheduled surgery time, and I was surprisingly feeling pretty calm — I think because things were actually happening, so all of the worrying I had done about ""what will this brand new experience be like and will I do it wrong and will the care team be mad at me????"" was calming down. I declined the anti-anxiety meds, so she skipped that one and gave me the others (I can't remember what these were — possibly more anti-nausea / pain / anti-inflammatory things?). She also put the anti-nausea patch behind/below my ear, put some inflatable compression cuffs on my lower legs, attached some sticky monitors to me (two to my chest, and one to my mid-back/side on the left), and gave me a hairnet/cap to put over my hair.

A little later (maybe around 9:10 AM or so), a new nurse came in and introduced herself as the person who would be taking me to the OR. She asked me if I had any cuts or bruises, which she said is so if they see anything during surgery they know that it's pre-existing rather than due to something that happened in the OR. She had me take off my glasses and put them in their case in the bag with my clothes, and then wheeled me back. My husband went back to the waiting room at this point.

**Operating room**

On the way to the OR, we stopped by the blanket warmer to get one more blanket because I was still pretty chilly. When I got to the operating room, the nurse who wheeled me in introduced everyone in there to me. There were five nurses (my doctor wasn't there yet, and neither was my anesthesiologist). I couldn't see them very well because I wasn't wearing my glasses, but they all waved and said hi.

The anesthesiologist's assistant was standing near the head of the operating table when I came in. One of the nurses was standing next to the table, I *think* doing something with various surgical instruments but I couldn't see well enough to tell. The other two were further away / toward the back of the room, near what might have been a sink.

The nurse who brought me in asked me one more time to say my name and birthday and the procedures I was having out loud, so everyone in the room could hear. She raised the bed I was on to be level with the operating table, and the nurse near the table pointed out a divot ""for my butt"". I scooted from the bed to the table and got positioned, laying down flat with my legs straight and together (no stirrups / awkward ""scoootch your butt a little further down""; they did all the positioning they needed for the surgery while I was asleep, which was nice). The two nurses helped me untie my gown and make sure I wasn't laying on it. I got to keep all three blankets on top of me during this process; I didn't feel exposed or cold at this point.

The anesthesiologist's assistant attached some wires to the monitors I had stuck on me, and the leg cuffs/blood pressure cuffs started inflating/deflating. He put an oxygen mask on me and asked me to take 5 deep breaths, and then said he'd start the meds flowing through the IV. The nurse who helped wheel me in was standing next to me and had her hand on my shoulder; she said I was doing great, which I remember thinking was really kind/comforting of her.

I think I got to maybe breath 2.5, and then I was waking up in post-op. I never felt loopy / drunk / high at all during this process; I went from 100% lucid to completely asleep almost immediately.

**Post-op recovery room**

I woke up from a dream I can't really remember (I think about work things? nothing trippy; very garden-variety content for me) and the first thing I felt was that I wasn't ready to wake up yet / really wanted to go back to sleep. I was propped up on a hospital bed in a half-sitting position, in my gown, with several layers of blankets on me and the compression cuffs still on my legs. I was in a ward with at least a few other post-surgery patients (we were separated by big curtains, but I could hear what was going on with other people).

The nurse asked me how I felt. I had pretty bad cramps (though: not as bad as during my last period. Those were maybe a 7-8 on the 1-10 pain scale: they made me sweat and want to throw up and almost cry. These were maybe a 5-6: painful enough that I wanted meds, but not excruciating). I also told her I felt kind of sick to my stomach.

I asked for water, and she gave me a cup with ice water along with an emesis bag in case I needed to throw up and told me to drink it slowly.

She told me she was going to get my husband from the waiting room, and also to get some meds.

My husband came in, and the nurse came back with Tylenol and oxy. She said I could have either or both. I asked what she recommended, and she said both, so I took them. I remember asking how long they would take to kick in, and she said 30 minutes. She also injected some anti-nausea meds into my IV and said that would take about 10 minutes.

I asked if I could pull my knees up / put my feet flat on the bed, and she said I could do whatever felt comfortable. She also offered snacks; I took applesauce and ginger ale (and later a couple of saltines), and some more water. At some point during this she took off the leg compression cuffs (possibly before I moved my legs; I can't remember).

I asked if everything went well, and she said something vague and pleasant like ""yep! you're all done!"". I asked my husband if he'd heard anything, and he said that he thought I'd been in surgery for about an hour and that it had gone well — it was maybe 11:30 (?) at this point; I think my surgery got started around 9:15.

I started to feel a little less sleepy/nauseated, and my cramps started feeling a little better. My doctor came in and said things went well; they did find a ton of endometrial tissue (it feels really good to have this officially diagnosed!) but it didn't prevent the bisalp surgery or the cyst removal, which is great.

One of my Fallopian tubes was filled with fluid (hydrosalpinx), so she said they gave me some IV antibiotics at some point before I woke up to be safe, but otherwise it didn't cause any complications. Everything else went smoothly. She went over the meds she had prescribed me and said they were already ready at the pharmacy. She also gave the aftercare instructions to my husband and asked if we had any other questions, which I didn't. She did say she took pictures, but I haven't seen them — I'm assuming we'll go over them at my post-op appointment later this month.

After she left, my husband ran out to pick up my prescriptions while I stayed in bed and worked on drinking water and ginger ale and waking up a bit more. I also texted my family/friends (my husband had already messaged them, but I was starting to feel a little bored/lonely while he was gone) to let them know I was in recovery & all had gone well. This was about 1:00 PM.

The nurse came in while my husband was out and asked if I was ready to try getting dressed/peeing. I said yes, and she offered to help me, but I felt okay enough to try it on my own. She also offered me disposable mesh undies and a new pad (I woke up with one between my legs).

I managed to change on my own, but I did get really jittery/shaky and had to stop and take a few deep breaths along the way. My husband came back right as I finished putting on my shoes. I got overwhelmed by the jitters/shakiness and started to cry a little bit in a big, heaving sob, gasping for air kind of way. It was *really* brief—like maybe three sobs?—and I didn't actually feel emotionally overwhelmed or in pain (mostly just...embarrassed?). The nurse came back in during it and asked if I was ready to pee, and I told her that I thought I was fine but I was just crying randomly, and also that I had a used pad in my hand that I didn't know what to do with (there didn't seem to be a trash can in my room). She said it was probably the anesthesia and was no big deal; it happens all the time. She also very gently put on gloves and took the pad from me and said she'd throw it away (this felt like the biggest sign that I was coming down off of meds — I was maybe a little overly concerned/stumped by this used pad). It took me maybe 15 seconds to calm myself down.

She helped me to the bathroom (across the hallway) and told me to pull the red cord next to the toilet when I was done. I peed normally, with no pain, and was washing my hands when she knocked on the door (apparently she literally meant to pull the cord before I stood up — oops). I told her I was washing my hands; she came in and helped walk me back to my cubicle, where I sat down on a chair.

Another nurse brought a wheelchair over, and my husband went to pull the car around to the entrance. After I sat down in the wheelchair, the first recovery nurse removed my IV (she said she was going to and I was mentally bracing for a weird sensation, but she was wrapping gauze/a bandage around my hand before I even realized it was done). They wheeled me out and helped me get in the car with a regular bed pillow over my stomach / under the seatbelt. This was around 1:45 PM.

**Recovery - Day 0 (Monday)**

Pain levels: 5-6 at the hospital; maxed out at 3 at home / Nausea levels: 7-8

I slept on the couch most of Monday afternoon/evening after getting home. I tried to stay hydrated (water, ginger ale mixed with cranberry juice, seltzer) and was able to get up and pee a few times without too much difficulty — no real pain, was able to stand up/sit down without trouble as long as I was careful. I was a little dizzy/shaky each time I got up, and I had a few more of those very brief panicked crying jags.

This might sound kind of ""woo"" but my theory was that even though emotionally I was fine / happy to have done it, and felt no regrets, and wasn't in any real physical pain, something in my body was still freaking out after having been through surgery, and those feelings just needed to vent somehow. This also could be purely from the anesthesia wearing off? Who knows. It happened maybe 3-4 times, each one lasting less than a minute. By the last couple I was like ""oh here we go again; bodies are so weird"" and just rode it out.

I wasn't very hungry, and I had a lot of nausea (but I didn't throw up; Zofran & deep, slow breathing were helpful). My throat wasn't sore, and it didn't hurt at all to pee. I did have some bright red spotting.

That day I took prescription ibuprofen, extra strength Tylenol, stool softener (prescribed but I think the same as the OTC stuff), anti-nausea meds (prescribed), and fiber gummies. I was also prescribed oxy, but decided not to take it because I wasn't really feeling cramps/pain by the time I was ready for my first post-hospital dose.

Eating was kind of weird, both because food didn't really sound good and because I've been attempting to be vegan over the past month. My anesthesiologist said I should eat whatever I want and not worry about it, including nothing if I wasn't hungry, which was kind of nice — I had been worried about trying to follow a high-protein, high-fiber diet and completely messing up my digestive system if I didn't, so it was good to hear that ""anything you want"" was a doctor-approved post surgery meal.

This might be just me being spoiled but I found it nice to have a couple of different beverages handy — a water bottle with plain water at room temp, a seltzer or ginger ale or water + electrolytes in a cup with ice and a straw, and a hot tea in an insulated mug. Different sips of different things felt like they helped me manage my nausea a bit better than only having one option.

One of the things I was most worried about was sleeping. I'm usually a side or stomach sleeper, and so many people here have said they could only sleep flat on their backs. I managed to lay on my right side (the one with no incisions) with a pillow propped between my knees and sleep that way both on the couch for naps and in bed. I did wake up at 4:30 AM with mild cramps, and took some more ibuprofen (it had been just over 8 hours since the last dose, so this was pretty much on schedule).

**Recovery - Day 1 (Tuesday)**

Pain levels: 1-2 / Nausea levels: 6-7

Tuesday was more of the same — nausea I managed with Zofran, no pain that wasn't manageable with ibuprofen + Tylenol. I had some extremely mild gas pain that feels like a twinge in my shoulder. My anesthesiologist said to try to lay down on the side that's hurting, which will cause the gas bubbles to move around and hopefully take pressure off of the nerve that's causing pain. This...maybe helped? But honestly it wasn't nearly as bad as I had feared; a stubbed toe or bumped elbow feels worse to me.

I did have a headache, which could be surgery-related or could be because I hadn't had any coffee since Sunday morning at this point (I usually drink \~3 cups a day). I had some iced coffee, which felt like it helped a bit.

A couple more crying bits in the morning. I was also starting to feel lonely / frustrated — I spent the day in bed, and in hindsight I would have preferred to come downstairs and hang out in the living room with our pets. I was feeling off (nauseated / headachey, but not in pain) enough that I couldn't focus on reading or knitting or watching TV for too long, so I spent a lot of the day playing TV in the background and trying to nap. I did make it downstairs / microwave a bowl of soup / make it back upstairs by myself around midday, which felt like a real victory.

I also had my first shower and first bowel movement on Tuesday afternoon (has anyone ever been more excited to poop than the folks in this group?). Both were pretty unremarkable. Peeing still felt fine, and I was still spotting a bit.

I took off the bandaids over my incisions as per instructions from my doctor, and then replaced the two bandaids on my left side to help protect them from rubbing on my clothes. My belly button incision is so deep that I can't really see it (the bandaid that I thought was on top of it was just...next to it?), so I didn't bother adding a new bandaid there. I felt a little squeamish/dizzy while I was doing this, but it didn't hurt, and the incisions seem fine? Very neat pink lines on my left side; nothing gory.

I started to notice my incisions a little more on Tuesday (they didn't really feel like anything on Monday) — it's not terrible; it's like a cat scratch or a longer paper cut in that it stings a bit/pulls a little. I haven't looked *super* closely, but I don't see any visible stitches, so I think they're closed using surgical glue.

Tuesday night was a little unusual: I got up five times in the middle of the night to pee, and I woke up another time with some pretty bad coughing (I think from the intubation). Every time I peed was ""normal"" in that nothing hurt / I actually peed (unlike when you have a UTI and you don't actually need to pee, you just feel like you do).

**Recovery — Day 2 (Wednesday)**

Pain levels: 1 / Nausea levels: 4

Wednesday I was pretty sleepy in the morning because I barely slept the night before, but otherwise I felt mostly okay. I did have to pee every 30-60 minutes all morning (the spotting seems to be getting better). I ended up calling my doctor about this mid-morning — mostly because at that point I was worried I'd never sleep well again — and they said not to worry unless it hurt, smelled bad, or had anything in it (blood, albumin); it's probably because I've been drinking so much water & because I had IV fluids. This sort of evened out over the day; I only woke up once on Wednesday night to pee.

I took a Zofran in the morning for nausea but didn't need any the rest of the day; I also took Tylenol & ibuprofen in the morning and then forgot about taking my afternoon doses because I wasn't in any pain. This was also the first day I felt *hungry*. Until this point I had mostly been eating crackers, oatmeal with roasted apples, carrots & hummus, and tomato soup. Wednesday morning I had a smoothie because I was still feeling a little nauseated, but by Wednesday afternoon I was craving salty things/more substantial food.

No crying today! 🎉 I had a pre-scheduled therapy appointment that I ended up cancelling because I was so sleepy (my therapist had mentioned this before and said it was totally fine for me to cancel last minute); I'm planning to ask her about this particular side effect when I meet with her next time because I'm kind of curious about it.

I did take one more ibuprofen in the evening — not because I was in pain, but because I wasn't sure if I was supposed to keep taking these for anti-inflammatory purposes (update: the nurse at my doctor's office said I can stop these whenever I feel like I don't need them).

My throat felt kind of gross all day (I've heard that the coughing/side effects from intubation can hit a little later in the recovery process), and I've been coughing here and there — especially at night while laying down—but it hasn't really hurt my abdomen. I did stifle a sneeze at one point in the early morning because I was worried that would be too much excitement for my internal organs (it came out as a weird honking noise and my husband woke up and laughed at me).

**Recovery — Day 3 (Thursday)**

Pain levels: 0-1 / Nausea levels: 0

Today is Thursday, and I woke up with a very mildly itchy rash on my forearm, which is a fun new development. I called my doctor and avoided taking all of my meds (luckily I don't feel like I need any of them) until I heard back. A nurse called me to check in, and she said because the rash is on my arm (not the one that had the IV) and not on my torso/back, it's not particularly concerning. She said I don't need to keep taking meds if I don't feel like I need them, but I *can* still take them if I want them. She's going to double check with my doctor and call back if anything changes, and asked me to call them if the rash gets bigger or spreads.

After I talked to her, I decided to keep taking the docusate (she said people usually take this for about a week) and the fiber gummies (I've had one BM but better safe than sorry, I think), and avoid the ibuprofen/Tylenol/Zofran for now — I'm not in pain or nauseated, so I don't feel like I need them.

The incisions still feel vaguely annoying (like surface-level cuts or scratches, they sting a bit but it's not overwhelming or bad), and occasionally I feel a light twinge in my lower abdomen when moving around. The shakiness/dizziness seems to be gone, as does the nausea and headache. I don't have any cramping, and I'm able to lay down on both sides, walk up and down stairs without feeling unstable, and sit however I want. I'm still being a *little* careful getting out of bed (using my arms and legs to help get up, as opposed to just my core; standing up slowly to make sure I'm not dizzy), but I mostly feel fine. Other people have mentioned that their abs feel sore, like after a workout, but I haven't experienced that much — I feel like I can stretch slowly in different directions without anything feeling like it's pulling/tugging.

Peeing is still painless (and back on a more regular schedule), and the spotting is mostly gone. No cramps, and no crying today, either.

I haven't done (or felt up to) any exercise yet aside from walking around my house, but I feel like today I could probably do a short walk on the treadmill without too much trouble. I'm going to give that another day or two just to be safe, but my energy levels are back and I'm more able to focus (exhibit A: this gigantic post).

I'm planning to take off my anti-nausea patch today (the anesthesiologist said it works for about 3 days). I have a WFH job and probably could be back at my desk today, but I think I would be exhausted by the end of the day. I'm glad I took the whole week off so I can feel fully rested before I have to start using my brain for anything difficult again.

**Things I would have changed about my prep:**

* I would have worn warmer socks: I spent a lot of the pre-op time at the hospital pretty cold, and I got to keep my own socks on during surgery, so I wish I'd worn some that came up higher than my ankles.
* I would have asked my doctor/nurse beforehand what meds they usually prescribe and what OTC meds they recommend, so I could avoid buying things I didn't need.

**Things that surprised me:**

* The dry mouth; oh my *god* the dry mouth. I woke up so thirsty on Monday before my surgery and don't feel like I've fully gotten back to normal. This is one of the side effects of the anti-nausea patch so I'm hoping it goes away today after I take the patch off, but it's been really annoying. On the plus side, it means I'm drinking a lot, so maybe it's helping?
* How fast the anesthesia kicked in: I thought there would be a spiel about counting back from 100 or thinking about some place nice, but it truly was ""here take a couple of deep breaths for me"" and then I was waking up in the recovery room.
* How my anxiety spiked the weekend before the surgery, but got better the closer I got to the OR.
* When they offer you ""warm blankets"" in the hospital, they are actually heated up, which is really nice.
* How many people were in the OR. It was really nice of the person who wheeled me in to introduce me to all of them, and of the anesthesiologist to tell me her assistant's name beforehand so when he was behind me attaching things to my sensors I wasn't surprised that it wasn't her.
* The weird panicked crying bits. I was a bit worried that I'd come out of anesthesia a total mess, but mostly I was sleepy, and this kicked in a bit later. It seems well within the realm of normal, and the nurses didn't seem at all phased by it. It was helpful to remind myself that it's common, and that I was okay, and to do a physical/mental check-in with myself to be like ""hey, you're not in pain, you're not scared, you're not sad, this is chemical.""
* How low my pain levels have been. I know this isn't universal, and I don't mean to diminish or discount the experience of anyone who's had it worse. I was *really* nervous about being in so much pain I couldn't sleep, but overall this has been better than my average period.
* The peeing. So much peeing. Just...be prepared, I guess?
* The rash on my arm. The internet was (predictably) full of ""OH NO AN ALLERGIC REACTION GO TO THE HOSPITAL"" advice, but it's staying the same size, and I don't have any other symptoms, so I feel like calling my doctor about it (who also didn't seem concerned) was the right move there.

I have my post-op appointment in a couple of weeks to go over the pathology reports / next steps for treating the endometriosis. Until then, I'm expecting that I'll keep feeling better each day, and I plan to keep calling my doctor if any other weird symptoms pop up (even though I feel awkward/like a ""problem patient"" each time before I make the call, they've been very nice and reassuring and helpful).

I have not yet seen a bill or explanation of benefits, so that's the last piece that I'm a little nervous about, but I feel pretty well prepared for that based on the previous threads here.

If you've gotten to the end of this massive post: thanks for reading! I hope it was helpful.

And please, God, if you know who I am don’t read this I’ll die of shame. I posted this on another subreddit as well, I never post on here so sorry if that's frowned upon or something. 



I (20m) have never been in an actual relationship. I have, however, found myself in many a life-altering situationship that have all affected me in different horrendous ways that I just refer to them as exes and break ups.



I’m gay, and living in both my hometown and college town there’s a low population of potential partners, and even then it’s not exactly the type of people I’m interested in. So I was very excited late November to match with a gorgeous dude on Tinder. And I mean GORGEOUS. Like, exactly my type to a T. Could not be better if you tried, I cannot stress this enough.



It got even better when we started talking. We hit it off instantly, becoming close quickly and talking non stop daily. He was perfect. Once again, he was everything I’ve ever wanted in someone. Even the flaws and things he admitted he had to work on I still liked. And, for the first time in my entire romantic life, I felt like someone liked me as much as I liked them. He was incredibly kind and communicative, always reassuring just when I needed it, excited to meet me and go on dates, I mean, the dude even once said he was enchanted by me. I thought for sure this was the one.



We had planned a date late December after Christmas, a few days after his dad, who he told me was abusive in the past (part of why he had been diagnosed with PTSD, which he had also confided in me), came and went from a surprise visit for the holidays. It was a rough few days for him, but he got through it just fine.



I had to drive about an hour and a half to get to his city for the date, which I had said I was fine with. He let me know when I was about 30 minutes out that he was likely going to be a few minutes late. Once again, no rush, no worries! After all, we were both so excited to finally meet that I was fine waiting however long he needed, as long as it happened. I made my way to the parking lot outside the coffee shop he recommended (the date was his idea after all), and he sent a text saying he was getting a call from his dad, a family emergency, but that he was rushing to get through it and get ready to meet me.



Now I had been waiting in my car for about an hour. The cafe closed early on the day we had chosen, so I let him know I was moving to the backup place we had decided on. He didn’t respond until an hour later when I called him, only to have him reply that he was still on the phone, he felt like shit for making me wait, he was grateful I was being patient, and that he’d “drive up in a little bit” to pay for my parking.



Here’s where I may have made a mistake. I assumed “drive up in a little bit” meant, y’know, drive up to where I was waiting once this was sorted out. Looking back now, it’s also possible he meant drive northbound to where I live in a “little bit”, i.e. a few days.



Over the next few hours I occasionally sent him texts asking if everything is alright and how it’s going, to which he’d respond in about 30 minutes time that he was still on the phone. After six hours of waiting in my car (it was now dark and, being Michigan in the winter, very cold) I sent a text saying that I was heading home, followed by an audio message explaining that I was really hurt, not by him, as I know he had no control over anything, but by the unfortunate situation, and that when he’s feeling better I’d like to have a conversation about it.



He left me on delivered for a few days, and then read. On New Year’s Eve, I sent him a text, he responded apologizing saying life’s been crazy, and we started talking again. Everything was fine.



After a few days and a while of talking, I pressed him for some kind of apology for our failed date. Admittedly, I was letting all my friends who were on my side and now distrusting of him get to me a little bit, making me maybe come on a little strong. I once again assured him that I wasn’t upset at him, but I still was upset and wanted a form of reassurance, if not just to quiet the voice in my head that was making me have doubts.



That same night, I saw that he had posted a new playlist on Spotify, titled “comforting”, with a bio that said “A mix of music for Jason” (fake name). Of course, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. There’s technically nothing too worrying about that.



Until he sent me the cover he had edited for that playlist later that night. I asked what the playlist was for, since we both bond over music, and he said it was because he was “feeling sappy” and that “New Year’s called for it”. Directly after, I noticed he had privated the playlist on Spotify. Now I was more worried.



A few days of talking normally go by, and one night I ask him if he’d like to stream a movie together the next day. Just texting while we watched a movie at the same time, if that makes sense. He said he’d let me know because he was out of town for a portion of the next day. I woke up, checked Instagram (where we did most of our talking), only to find that he had unfollowed me and removed me as a follower. I sent a basic message just saying that it was “not cool” before later, when crying about it to my friend, I sent another text asking if he’d at least tell me what I did wrong so I know for the future.



He didn’t reply to that until that night, where he said that I “could’ve at least asked if it was something personal, which it was” before he said “bye” and blocked me. I sent a text to his number, saying that it’s quite unfair of him to expect me to do detective work trying to figure out why he shut me out. The next morning I sent a long text about respecting whatever decision he made, before asking person to person if he was okay, because I care about him and know that he was going through a lot lately. Truthfully, I still feel like this was all self sabotage brought on by his PTSD and whatever emergency he had with his abusive father.



Of course, he never replied. I didn’t reach out to him again until mid-January, where I attempted to send another text asking how he was before seeing my number was blocked. Then, like any crazy person does, I sent him a text on TikTok that, I’ll admit, was not the work of a healed person. I kinda just wanted to burn the last bridge I had and get out the anger I had in my system.



I said, “Hey, I’m never gonna contact you again after this, but I just wanna lyk that I sincerely hope you never do that lovebomb and then rugpull with no explanation or conversation to anyone else ever again! Shit feels horrible, learn to use your words!”



Expectedly, he blocked me on TikTok before the day was over. It made me feel better for a few days, but now I’m feeling worse than ever. I miss him horribly, and now I can feel my brain rewriting the history of what happened. But am I wrong for thinking that now I might have been the one in the wrong from the beginning?



Whatever the truth is, it doesn’t matter. I feel like I’ve missed my one shot with my soulmate, as dumb as that sounds since we never even met. And don’t worry about him being a catfish or something, we had facetimed so that’s not a possibility. I just feel so empty and hopeless for anything in the future, and I feel as if I’ll never get over him. Him leaving has saddled me with a lot of self doubt, insecurity, and other ugly emotions that I hate feeling. Stuff I thought I was over with by now!



TLDR because Jesus Christ holy yap; My ex talking stage was insanely perfect both physically and personality-wise and at least one of us fumbled the bag. How do I cope with feeling like I lost my chance at love? And a fun bonus question, am I the villain in my own story?

I've read a lot of thread, I've seen a lot a youtube videos but I couldn't get rid of my sour espressos.

I'm using a gaggia classic pro (with 9 bar OPV) with a DF54. I'm also using a MiiCoffee Tamper and a coffee distributor with a bottomless porta filter. I don't have any channeling and the temp is good (using the temp surfing method). I tried with medium and dark coffee, it's the same.

I've also did a salami shot (with 3 \* 10 seconds). The first one was too sour (impossible to drink) but the second and last shot were good (no sourness).

But when I check my porta filter it looks weird on the edges, it looks like it's pressed on the edges).

I've tried different weights (17g to 20g) and also different grind size (pulling 36g in 20, 25 or 30sec). I've also tried to pull 50g or 60g but the sourness is still present.

Do you have any advice ?

Anna had always been proud of her smile. Growing up, her parents made sure she visited the dentist regularly, and she followed a solid routine of brushing and flossing. However, as she got older, life became busier, and her focus on her oral health began to slip. Between working long hours as a marketing executive, managing a hectic social life, and raising two young children, Anna found herself prioritizing everything but her smile. As a result, she started noticing problems with her teeth and gums—sensitive spots, occasional bleeding gums, and a lack of freshness that even mouthwash couldn’t seem to fix.

Anna felt self-conscious about her smile, especially in professional settings. She was no longer the confident, radiant person she once was, and she began hiding her teeth more often, especially when smiling. Her dentist visits became more frequent, with every checkup revealing issues that seemed to get worse over time. The expensive treatments and dental cleanings were no longer enough to keep her oral health in top shape. She needed something more—something she could integrate into her daily life to prevent further decline.  
  
One evening, while scrolling through her social media feed, Anna came across an ad for **ProDentim**, a new oral health supplement. The product claimed to improve dental health from the inside out by supporting healthy gums, freshening breath, and promoting stronger teeth. The ad emphasized that the supplement was made with natural ingredients, including probiotics and other plant-based compounds that supported oral health. The testimonials from users who had experienced improvements in their teeth and gum health immediately caught Anna’s attention. Could this be the answer she had been looking for?  
  
After reading through more information about the supplement and how it worked, Anna was intrigued but also skeptical. She had tried various oral health products over the years, but nothing seemed to make a lasting difference. However, the idea of a natural supplement working in tandem with her regular oral hygiene routine seemed promising. She decided to give it a try.  
  
**Week 1: A Fresh Start**  
  
Anna started taking **ProDentim** every morning as instructed, dissolving one of the chewable tablets in her mouth. The taste was pleasant, with a mild mint flavor that left her mouth feeling fresh. The instructions said to take it regularly for the best results, so Anna committed to sticking with it, hopeful that this could be the key to restoring her oral health.  
  
In the first few days, Anna didn’t notice anything dramatic, but there was a subtle difference. Her mouth felt cleaner for a longer period of time, and she was waking up with less of the dry, uncomfortable feeling that had become a regular part of her mornings. Her breath seemed fresher, too, even after meals. She was still vigilant about brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash, but the combination of these efforts with **ProDentim** seemed to be making her feel a little more confident about her oral health.  
  
By the end of the first week, Anna began to notice something else: her gums were no longer as sensitive as they had been. In the past, her gums would often bleed slightly when brushing or flossing, but the discomfort had diminished. It wasn’t a complete change, but the improvement was encouraging. She felt hopeful that this was just the beginning.  
  
**Week 3: Noticeable Improvement**  
  
By the third week, Anna’s initial optimism had blossomed into real results. Her gums, which had been a source of constant irritation, were visibly healthier. There was no bleeding when she brushed, and the redness that had plagued her gums for months had faded. Her teeth felt smoother, and the lingering plaque buildup that had always been hard to get rid of was significantly reduced.  
  
More than that, her confidence was slowly returning. Anna had always been the type of person to smile easily, but she’d felt increasingly self-conscious about showing her teeth. Now, with healthier gums and fresher breath, she found herself smiling more freely, even in professional settings. She felt like she was regaining control over her oral health and could take pride in her smile again.  
  
Anna also noticed that the occasional morning sensitivity in her teeth, especially to hot or cold foods and beverages, had significantly diminished. The sharp discomfort that she used to experience after drinking a hot cup of coffee or eating something cold was no longer there. While it wasn’t entirely gone, the relief she felt was enough for her to be more optimistic about continuing the supplement.  
  
**Week 5: A Healthier, Brighter Smile**  
  
By week five, Anna’s results were becoming undeniable. Her teeth had visibly brightened, and her smile looked more vibrant than it had in months. The effects of **ProDentim** had not only been about reducing sensitivity and promoting healthier gums, but her teeth also felt stronger and more resistant to damage. Her dentist, who she visited for a routine cleaning during this time, was surprised by the improvement in her oral health.  
  
“Your gums are much healthier than they were last time,” the dentist remarked. “I’m impressed! Whatever you’re doing, keep it up.”  
  
Anna smiled, feeling a sense of pride she hadn’t felt in a long time. It wasn’t just the physical improvement in her teeth that made her happy—it was the emotional boost she got from feeling like she had regained control over her health. She hadn’t realized how much her oral health had affected her confidence and mental well-being until she began to feel better about it again.  
  
The occasional morning dryness in her mouth had vanished entirely, and her breath remained fresh throughout the day, even after meals. The natural ingredients in **ProDentim**, such as probiotics, which promoted a healthy balance of bacteria in her mouth, were clearly making a difference. Anna also realized she wasn’t just seeing improvements in her oral health—she was also feeling better overall. The simple addition of this supplement to her routine had become part of a larger effort to take better care of herself.  
  
**Week 8: Full Transformation**  
  
By the eighth week, Anna had fully embraced her new oral health routine. Her gums were in the best condition they had been in years, and her teeth looked whiter, healthier, and stronger. She no longer dreaded visiting the dentist, knowing that her oral health was improving.  
  
What was even more remarkable was how much her self-esteem had transformed. She was smiling more freely in both personal and professional situations. Her teeth felt cleaner and smoother after every brushing, and she no longer felt the need to hide behind closed lips or avoid talking too much for fear of bad breath.  
  
Anna realized that **ProDentim** had not just been a quick fix, but a sustainable part of her journey to better health. The supplement had become an integral part of her routine, alongside regular brushing, flossing, and dental checkups. She felt empowered, knowing she was taking proactive steps to care for her teeth and gums in a way that was both natural and effective.  
  
Her friends and family began to notice the difference as well. “You look great, Anna! What’s your secret?” they’d ask, noticing the new radiance in her smile.  
  
“Just taking care of myself—and a little help from **ProDentim**,” she’d reply with a smile that now felt more genuine than ever before.  
  
**A New Chapter in Oral Health**  
  
Anna’s journey with **ProDentim** had transformed her smile—and her confidence—beyond what she could have expected. What began as a simple supplement for improving oral health had turned into a life-changing part of her self-care routine. Her teeth and gums were stronger and healthier, her breath was fresher, and her smile was brighter than it had been in years.  
  
Anna’s story was one of reclaiming control over her health, and with **ProDentim**, she had taken the first step in a journey to a healthier, more vibrant future.

More than that, her confidence was slowly returning. Anna had always been the type of person to smile easily, but she’d felt increasingly self-conscious about showing her teeth. Now, with healthier gums and fresher breath, she found herself smiling more freely, even in professional settings. She felt like she was regaining control over her oral health and could take pride in her smile again.  
  
Anna also noticed that the occasional morning sensitivity in her teeth, especially to hot or cold foods and beverages, had significantly diminished. The sharp discomfort that she used to experience after drinking a hot cup of coffee or eating something cold was no longer there. While it wasn’t entirely gone, the relief she felt was enough for her to be more optimistic about continuing the supplement.  
  
**Week 5: A Healthier, Brighter Smile**  
  
By week five, Anna’s results were becoming undeniable. Her teeth had visibly brightened, and her smile looked more vibrant than it had in months. The effects of **ProDentim** had not only been about reducing sensitivity and promoting healthier gums, but her teeth also felt stronger and more resistant to damage. Her dentist, who she visited for a routine cleaning during this time, was surprised by the improvement in her oral health.  
  
“Your gums are much healthier than they were last time,” the dentist remarked. “I’m impressed! Whatever you’re doing, keep it up.”  
  
Anna smiled, feeling a sense of pride she hadn’t felt in a long time. It wasn’t just the physical improvement in her teeth that made her happy—it was the emotional boost she got from feeling like she had regained control over her health. She hadn’t realized how much her oral health had affected her confidence and mental well-being until she began to feel better about it again.  
  
The occasional morning dryness in her mouth had vanished entirely, and her breath remained fresh throughout the day, even after meals. The natural ingredients in **ProDentim**, such as probiotics, which promoted a healthy balance of bacteria in her mouth, were clearly making a difference. Anna also realized she wasn’t just seeing improvements in her oral health—she was also feeling better overall. The simple addition of this supplement to her routine had become part of a larger effort to take better care of herself.  
  
**Week 8: Full Transformation**  
  
By the eighth week, Anna had fully embraced her new oral health routine. Her gums were in the best condition they had been in years, and her teeth looked whiter, healthier, and stronger. She no longer dreaded visiting the dentist, knowing that her oral health was improving.  
  
What was even more remarkable was how much her self-esteem had transformed. She was smiling more freely in both personal and professional situations. Her teeth felt cleaner and smoother after every brushing, and she no longer felt the need to hide behind closed lips or avoid talking too much for fear of bad breath.  
  
Anna realized that **ProDentim** had not just been a quick fix, but a sustainable part of her journey to better health. The supplement had become an integral part of her routine, alongside regular brushing, flossing, and dental checkups. She felt empowered, knowing she was taking proactive steps to care for her teeth and gums in a way that was both natural and effective.  
  
Her friends and family began to notice the difference as well. “You look great, Anna! What’s your secret?” they’d ask, noticing the new radiance in her smile.  
  
“Just taking care of myself—and a little help from **ProDentim**,” she’d reply with a smile that now felt more genuine than ever before.  
  
**A New Chapter in Oral Health**  
  
Anna’s journey with **ProDentim** had transformed her smile—and her confidence—beyond what she could have expected. What began as a simple supplement for improving oral health had turned into a life-changing part of her self-care routine. Her teeth and gums were stronger and healthier, her breath was fresher, and her smile was brighter than it had been in years.  
  
Anna’s story was one of reclaiming control over her health, and with **ProDentim**, she had taken the first step in a journey to a healthier, more vibrant future.  
  
This fictionalized story highlights the potential benefits of **ProDentim** in improving oral health, from gum health to fresher breath and a brighter smile. It underscores how the supplement can work alongside good hygiene practices to create lasting positive change in both appearance and confidence.",1,1738870145.0,KibbexKpop,3,1.0,False

So this month I am avoiding the supermarket as best I can and supporting my local stores which I don't do as often as I'd like! I live in a shopping district in a small cheese making town in the Netherlands and everything is in walking distance.
 
I got coffee from the nut roaster (€12.50) and cheese from our amazing cheesemonger (€10.95). There are also wonderful bakeries for bread and pastries, a butcher, a fishmonger, a windmill to buy flour, an Italian deli, a Polish supermarket and a fruit and veg shop which is always well stocked. There is also a market in the square on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

The biggest surprise was a shop my friend recommended when I asked her where to get milk. It's self automated so I downloaded an app to open the door and pay for what I took on the honor system. I got the milk (local from the dairy in town), some mandarins cos they looked good (they were!) and some stuff for pizza, not local but organic and from Italy (€9.33). 

It is working out to be pricier but I find I'm buying way fewer impulse purchases and it all tastes so much better I also get to walk more which is a pain in the butt but also a good thing. And I get to support local.

It's day 6 and I honestly think I will never need to use big super ever again except maybe for cleaning supplies and cat litter.

They proactively refunded the 1 bag AND included a second bag for free that they thought would match my taste profile. 

Beyond that, they gave me their recipe for pour over and it really helped produce a fantastic cup of coffee. 

I started with the Kinini Village Cooperative - Natural, Bourbon. 

I used the slightly modified coffee chronicler recipe on the switch with cafec abaca. 

It was a great cup, got a good amount of lime with the white tea finish.

Then I tried Genres recommendation which is a slight modification of Tetsu’s new special hybrid. 

Such a different profile. So much sweetness, the lime sparkles, the green apple bites and the tea finish is perfect. 

Both recipes did me well but the modified new Tetsu is just such an exciting cup right now.

He was in a coffee shop and he exited in my apartment. He looked shocked because he didn't knew the place and then once again when he saw me. I told him something on the line of ""Welcome to my head, it's not like you ever left"" and we had a brief conversation but I don't remember what exactly we talked about. It felt genuine. I told him I can't stay long because I have to wake up early. All the time he looked so confused to be in my dream. 

The thing is, for the last (almost) two years I have regular dreams with him and occasionally his gf. We broke up on good terms. He wanted to follow God, but he just stumbled over another girl, who also happened to be a friend of mine. We were together for almost 4 years and it was the healthiest relationship I ever had. We had a great connection. This is the first dream I felt **he** was actually there, almost like our consciousnesses were trying to communicate.

Am I traumatized? Am I still not over it? I wouldn't want to get back together and these dreams only disturb my peace.

We haven't spoke for the last 18 months or so since it hurt me to see him with my friend, but they are a great fit nonetheless.

I'm just trying to find a sense in this mess of dreams I keep having. What should I do? Should I text him? I wouldn't wanna disturb his peace, but his memory is disturbing my existence, even tho I'm grateful for every day we spent together.

Now I want you to ask yourself, should this business exist? I.E. Do I, as a consumer, need or want this thing to continue to exist? If yes, then the jobs that are required to keep those businesses running should provide a living wage."" ---- ""Ah well those sorts of jobs are just for teenagers, not actual adults!"" Never mind the fact that the same baby boomers who pedal that nonsense were making [$10.45/hr (adjusted for inflation)](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm) in 1970.

The federal minimum wage went up year by year throughout the 1900’s and only now, when big corporations are lawfully wedded with Senators and Representatives, is it convenient to lock the minimum wage to an unsustainable, unlivable $7.25. Before tax, that brings you a *gross* income of $1160/mo in the state of Indiana where average rent is $1099/mo.

In 1970, the average home in the Indianapolis area cost $123,570 (adjusted for inflation). Today, [the average house in Indiana](https://www.zillow.com/home-values/22/in/) is a whopping $238,168. Throw in some [simple math](https://imgur.com/a/j8RYtyR).. If $123,570 was acceptable in 1970 with a minimum wage of $10.45 – then what is the acceptable minimum wage of 2025 and a housing cost of $238,169? Assuming the boomers had it right and had it good in 1970, the minimum wage should be $20.14.

How on Earth did we get this off track? It’s obvious: in 1995, the [Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995](https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/ldaorigins.pdf) left loopholes that let corporations sway our Senators and Reps with big donations to their reelection campaigns. The people who make the decisions are in bed with the corporations who want to pay their own employees as little as possible. The federal minimum wage has been locked at $7.25 since 2009 – approaching 20 years ago. This brings up all sorts of questions about the ethics behind lobbying

If the business should exist, the jobs should pay a living wage. It’s non-negotiable. Nobody cares how many jobs those businesses generate if the jobs don't pay enough to survive.",13,1738869884.0,Indiana,3,0.88,False

I’ve got the hard copy Extra Krusty Edition game for Nintendo Switch. Has anyone had trouble unlocking Pizza Pie Hole?? I’ve completed the coffee level, max pearls and fully upgraded. 

I’ve been banging my head against the wall trying to figure it out. Any help is appreciated.

1ijatu6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ijatu6/met_her_for_coffee_at_dd/,Met her for coffee at DD,"As the title says, we met for coffee Tuesday one week post breakup after she called it off with me due to “being in a bad head space, and trying to figure out how to function daily”.  We had coffee in the car (more private that way) and I cried, I cried hard and told her that I’m madly in love with her, she just kept saying it’s nothing about “us” personally, it’s just her own feelings right now. I’ve never been this vulnerable with a woman in my entire life, she took my hat off, grabbed my face and kissed me on the forehead, and told me she loved me, it was the most peace and calmness I had felt.

She called me that night and we had a great light hearted talk, telling funny stories and just making each other laugh. She has now been very distant since Tuesday, with 3 text messages exchanged, I told her to take her time and process her feelings and I’d give her space. It’s just all so confusing to me right now. 

As she pulled away from DD, she lipped through her window “I love you” and blew me a kiss. I’m 31 and she’s 27, we each have one child from previous relationships, and we are hung up on A) having 1 or 2 more and B) how she can be a stay at home mom, I told her in this economy with rising inflation it’s just very very difficult, and she is dead set on it. I promised her I would try and work hard to give her the closest life she dreamt of, and that I would love her everyday, and find new ways to love her everyday. I hope she’s taking the time to process all of this.

I'm in the process of redoing my home office. I previously had my desk set up so my back was to the wall, but I moved it as the room felt too small for that setup. For context, I want the room to have an inspiring and calming vibe. I'm thinking about putting up some simple framed art. 

I usually have my office chair at the desk, but moved it to vacuum. I also have a 5x7 low-pile rug, an armchair, a small side table, and a floor lamp I can add to the space. What are your thoughts on adding these elements? What would you change to make the space feel homey, calm and inspiring? 



[Where would you place the floor lamp?](https://preview.redd.it/sb3diehnjkhe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f1e2f5fff445755f77788192961cdc530e4dd5c)

Without fail every UE/DD driver will come up to me, past all the other patiently waiting customers, to shove their phone in my face, and wait with a vacant stare as I squint at the screen and try to figure out what order they’re looking for. 

God forbid their order isn’t already packed, because apparently I’m responsible for you getting your food to the customer on time (I’m not). 

Then you get the dumb stare while you desperately pack the order at the cost of everything else so that they’ll stop coming up to you every 5 seconds asking where it is.

It is not my responsibility or job to decipher, find and build your order the second you walk in. You are a customer like everyone else. You will receive the order when it’s ready. Please act like it. ",0,1738869420.0,UberEATS,43,0.39,False
