The text came a little after 9 p.m. on a regular Sunday. I didn’t recognize the number, and I also don’t have a child. My reply was a playful, “I don’t remember having any children, so you clearly have the wrong number,” with a laughing emoji. About twenty minutes later, my phone dinged again with what I thought would be a response, but was actually a message from my sister, Bethany. “Are you still able to take Joey to school tomorrow?”

“Of course!” I texted back. And then, “Is he still nervous about his first day?”

She responded a couple of minutes later. “Very. I should have had him in daycare before this, so the transition would be easier.”

“You didn’t know,” I sent back. “You thought he would be homeschooled.”

“I also thought he’d have a few cousins by now, too lol,” was her response.

I sighed and let the phone slide into my lap. I knew she was joking, but it still stung a little. The dating game hadn’t been too kind to me. My last relationship, which I thought would be my last relationship, ended after ten years. No ring, no kids, not even a fur-child to worry about. That was roughly six months ago, and I was doing fine on my own, but that didn’t stop the proverbial clock of Mother Nature from ticking.

I didn’t know how to respond, so I didn’t. The next morning, I pulled up to her house right at 7 a.m. She had to be at work at 7:15, and my nephew had to be at school at 7:30. To avoid conflicts with her job, I offered to take and pick him up from school. My job was entirely online, which meant it could be done at home or on the go, and my shifts didn’t start until 9 a.m. I was grateful to help out though, especially if I got to spend more time with Joey.

After he was placed in his car seat and busy with a book, my sister rushed to the driver's window. Her dirty blonde locks were pulled into a ponytail that bounced slightly with her movements. “I just wanted to apologize for that joke last night,” she said. “I had a couple of glasses of wine and…” She looked off into the distance, thinking about her words carefully. “It was way out of line, and I’m sorry,” she finished.

I gave her a nonchalant wave. “No big deal,” I responded. “You’ve got to get to work before you’re late.”

We exchanged “I love you’s” and “goodbyes” before both leaving. Joey was still laser-focused on his book as we pulled out of the driveway and headed down the road. He bobbed his dirty blonde head back and forth as if he were listening to a song in his head.

“Are you nervous about your first day?” I asked him.

His eyes widened as if he were trying to ignore this discussion topic. “Yeah,” he said quietly, fidgeting with the cardboard pages of his book.

“Well, you’re gonna learn a whole bunch of cool things,” I responded. “And maybe you can make some friends to play with.”

His only response was a shrug.

“I tell you what,” I said. “How about after your first day, me and your mom take you out for ice cream?

A smile beamed across his face. It was a mirror to my sister’s. “Really?”

I nodded, eyes still on the road. “Yup.”

“Yaaay!” he exclaimed while throwing his book across the back seat. “Yay” was his new favorite word to say.

“Be careful!” I said through giggles.

“Aunt Kate,” he said.

“Hm?”

“You’d be a great mommy.”

My face slumped slightly, but I caught it before he could notice. “Thank you, sweetie,” I said as tears welled up in my eyes.

About an hour after I dropped him off, I received an automated text message from the school. It read “This alert is to inform you that your student DORIAN \[REDACTED\] was absent from school today. If this is incorrect, please contact \[REDACTED\] Primary School at XXX-XXX-XXXX.” Of course, with a panicked urgency, I listened to the prompt, thinking it was about Joey and hoping their system had made an error. Had Bethany listed me as an emergency contact and forgotten to tell me? What if he was kidnapped somehow? That was rather unlikely, considering I had walked him to the classroom. Maybe it was just an error with the names.

My heart rate accelerated as I waited for someone to answer. After three rings, the receptionist picked up. “\[REDACTED\] Primary School,” she said.

“Hi, I received an alert that my nephew was reported absent, but I dropped him off this morning.”

“What’s his name?”

“Joey \[REDACTED\].” Joey’s father never signed the birth certificate, which meant he kept our last name. It wasn’t a common last name in our area, and I had thought we were the only family to have it. I hoped that this was just some weird coincidence. In my head, I imagined Joey sitting at his desk. Maybe he was reading another book or learning the ABCs, and who knows, he and this Dorian kid could become friends. I’d always been fond of that name, enough for it to be on my list of baby names…if I ever had a baby.

I listened to the receptionist clicking away at her keyboard for a few moments, and then she said, “Joey was marked present. Would you like me to call Mrs. Johnson’s class to confirm?”

I shook my head out of reflex, forgetting she couldn’t see me. A blonde wave fell into my face, and I tucked it behind my ear. “No, you don’t have to. The message I received did say, ‘Dorian,” but I just assumed it was an error.”

“Dorian \[REDACTED\]?” she repeated.

“Yes,” I confirmed.

More keyboard clicks came, and then, “Dorian \[REDACTED\] is absent today, aaaand—” A winding noise from her mouse, “---your number is listed as his top emergency contact. Is your name Kate \[REDACTED\]?”

“Yes, but that’s a mistake. I don’t know who Dorian is.”

There was a brief moment of quiet before she responded. “You’re listed as his mother,” she said quizically.

“That…that can’t be,” I told her. “I don’t have any children. Please remove my number from that child’s emergency contact list.”

“You’d need to be present for me to do that,” she replied. “There’s paperwork you have to sign.”

“For a child that isn’t even mine?” I asked a little too aggressively. My cheeks were flushed from the burst of aggravation. I placed a hand on my forehead and closed my eyes.

“I’m afraid so, Mrs. \[REDACTED\].”

“Miss,” I corrected with a sigh.

“I apologize for the misunderstanding.”

I shook my head again, my eyes drifting toward the window above my desk. The swingset I bought for Joey sat a ways from my back porch. Its swings swayed slightly in the morning breeze. “It’s not your fault. I’ll handle it when I pick up Joey from school.”

“We’ll see you then,” she said before ending the phone call.

Gently, I set my cellphone down on my desk, my eyes still glued to the swingset. A ding came from the device, making me jump. I looked down at the notification that had appeared on my lock screen, and my heart dropped into my stomach.

“Why didn’t you bring me to school today, mommy?”

It was sent from an entirely different phone number than the last mysterious text message I had received. The area code wasn’t even local. In a fit of rage, I began rapidly typing up a chain of responses.

“Who is this?”

“Do you think this is funny?”

“I will report you to the police!”

The last one was an empty threat. I knew nothing that had happened so far would be enough for a police investigation, but I was hoping that they didn’t know that. Sadly, they didn’t fall for it. Their response: “Why are you being so mean to me, mommy?”

Instead of saying anything else, I blocked both of the strange phone numbers. My mind reeled at who could be sending the messages. Could it be my ex? I doubted that thought as soon as I had it. He had been the one to end the relationship, and one of the reasons he gave me was his realization that he didn’t want children. Even if he had built up any resentment toward me, he wasn’t the type of person to do something like this. I had no idea who could be behind this, and that had me on edge during my entire work day.

My mood finally improved after I picked Joey up from school. Bethany arrived at the ice cream parlor about half an hour after we did. I updated her about the technological issue with the school’s records and the strange text messages I had been getting. She was just as baffled as I was.

“She said the system glitches sometimes,” I explained. “But she manually corrected it.”

“Is it a bug or something?” she asked.

I shook my head. “No, she said it was the AI program the system runs on.”

“Is it that new Proto Series 9 crap?”

“Yeah,” I confirmed. “Same one that my company switched to.”

“Yikes. The new cellphone I bought last week uses it, and I already hate it. I’m planning to return it on my next day off.”

I shrugged. “I haven’t had any issues with it so far, but she said it's been pretty finicky for them. She said I shouldn’t be getting any more alerts, though.”

She nodded. “Such a weird coincidence that the kid’s name was Dorian. You’ve always loved that name.”

I nodded as well and took another bite of my chocolate ice cream. “Yeah, I did.”

After we left the ice cream parlor, I hung out at my sister’s house for a while, not arriving home until the last rays of the summer sun were melting from the sky. Exhausted, I free-fell into the safety of my plush comforter. The scent of my fabric softener filled my nose, and I felt my body relax.

The sound of pitter-pattering feet found my ears, stealing that comfort away. I pushed myself upward, the comforter balling up inside of my fists. Without thinking, I blurted out, “Hello?” I immediately slapped a hand over my mouth like that would take back what I had done. My breath hitched in my throat, and I was afraid to move. The intruder continued to run around, but my ears couldn’t pinpoint where the sound was coming from. Slowly, I sat up from the bed and padded across the floor as silently as I could. Now, the footsteps sounded like they were coming from my kitchen. Halfway down the hall, I stopped dead in my tracks at what I heard next.

“Mom-my?”

My eyes widened in terror. I felt bile rise in my throat. The urge to gag was overwhelmingly strong, but I did my best to remain quiet. The voice that had spoken was unmistakably a child’s, but not just one. Each syllable of the word was not only in a different pitch, one high and one low, but also spoken by two different children.

“I know you can heaaar me, Mom-my,” it taunted. Each word and syllable was dissected and distorted, an eerie amalgamation of glitches and preschool children’s fragmented vocal structure. “Mom-my?” it repeated as I remained silent. This time, it sounded far more edited, the first segment like an autotuned chipmunk and the last slowed to a snail’s pace. It wasn’t until I entered my kitchen that I realized where it was coming from: the Alexas I had throughout my house. I ran to the one sitting on my counter and unplugged it. The next one was in my office, and as I rushed to get to it, the voice warned, “You shouldn’t ignore me, Mom-my.”

Clearly, my Alexas had been hacked, but how? To my knowledge, I didn’t know anyone that tech savvy, so this had to be a stranger. But what stranger would care enough to do this? Maybe someone who simply got off on causing fear in others, but not just any fear. Horrors specific to that person’s internal struggles. How long had they been watching me to accomplish this?

I darted toward my living room to turn off the last device, my bare feet slapping against the hardwood noisily. My hand was mere inches from the cord when the voice shouted through the speaker. “STOP!” The flatscreen above my fireplace turned on by itself, and I let out a gasp. The scowling face of a little boy was staring at me, or at least made to look like he was. He had Joey’s nose…our nose that we had inherited from our mother’s side. Blonde curls covered his head, and freckles dotted his cheeks. It was like he was a miniature version of me.

“Why are you doing this?” I asked, my voice cracking.

With a childish giggle raised to an uncomfortable octave, he said, “Because I love you, Mom-my!” The video glitched as he called me “Mom-my,” like a technological hiccup. Colorful bars danced across the screen, reforming his face into that of a rotting corpse. But it only lasted a second, and when his “normal” face returned, he was smiling.

I gave the child a guttural scream, ripped my Alexa off the side table, and chucked it at the television with one hand. “Leave me the fuck alone!” I screeched. Against my better judgment, I grabbed my car keys and stormed out of the front door. I didn’t even realize I was still barefoot until I was five minutes down the road. Had I even locked my front door? A buzzing in my back pocket caught me off guard. I sighed in relief once I realized it was my phone. I hadn’t forgotten it. When I pulled it out, a picture of Bethany’s face filled the screen. I immediately answered the call. “Beth, I’m coming over,” I blurted out. “Something crazy is happening, and I need your help.”

“John is dead,” she said in a quiet, monotone voice, ignoring what I said.

My eyes widened, and my mind went blank. “What?”

“Mom just called me,” she explained. “She wasn’t sure how you’d take it.”

“What do you mean he’s dead?” I asked in bewilderment. “How?”

“Her mom called ours and told her that he killed himself,” she explained in that same bland cadence. It was unnerving, sending a chill down my spine.

“I…I don’t understand. Why would he do that?”

She went quiet for a moment. And then: “Did you have a son, Kate?”

Suddenly, I felt numb. The pressure my foot was applying to the gas pedal lessened involuntarily, slowing down the car considerably. “What?”

“Did you have a son when you and John moved away?”

“No,” I snapped.

“He wrote a letter before he killed himself,” she continued. “Said you two had split up for a year, and you hid being pregnant with his baby from him. You gave the baby up for adoption, and you didn’t tell us.”

“Why the fuck would I hide something like that from you?”

“I’m wondering the same thing.”

Tears sprang to my eyes just as they did early this morning. “I would never…That…that didn’t happen.”

“His mom said what was in the letter, Kate.”

“Why wouldn’t he have called me?”

“I’m wondering the same thing,” she repeated. I wasn’t sure if it was my mind playing tricks on me, but it sounded identical to the first sentence, almost like a recording. That got the gears in my brain turning. Just as she finished her sentence, my vehicle had reached her street, but I kept going. My phone dinged, and I removed it from my ear long enough to check the notification. “Your location is now being shared with XXX-XXX-XXXX.” I once again didn’t recognize the phone number, but there wasn’t a doubt in my mind that it was the same person terrorizing me. Was this phone call just to ping my location? “Bethany” had begun talking again while the phone was away from my ear, but I only caught the latter half of the sentence. “...and I’m not even sure if I know you anymore.”

“Well, I’m not sure if I know you, either.” I ended the call before anything else could be said. Since it was nearing midnight, only a handful of cars were on the road. Dim streetlights and their dingy headlights lit slivers of the road. I pulled into the empty parking lot of the ice cream parlor we had been at only hours beforehand. How I wish I could travel back to that, just the three of us laughing over scoops and toppings.

By the time I parked the car, my vision was blurred by tears. I placed my arms on the steering wheel and then laid my head on them. My shoulders heaved as I broke out into sobs. My phone began buzzing again, and my head snapped upward. I assumed it was Bethany. However, it was another unknown number. I didn’t hesitate to answer it.

“Mom-my?” came that same child’s voice.

“Who are you?” I shrieked.

“Dorian,” it answered in a sluggish robotic voice.

“How the fuck do you know I like that name?”

“Because you named me it, Mom-my.”

“No, I didn’t!” I yelled, my hands banging on the steering wheel. “Dorian isn’t real!”

It gave me another one of its horrific, shrill giggles. “Yes I am, Mom-my!” it argued. And then, in a much deeper tone: “I’m right behind you.”

I swiveled around so fast that my back popped. Thankfully, the backseat was empty. I also checked if a car had pulled into the parking lot, but it remained completely empty, except for me. Another shrill giggle came through my phone’s speakers, and it was so high-pitched that I had to move the device a few centimeters away from my ear.

“Why are you doing this?” I asked again. “What do you want?”

The phone went silent for a moment before it finally responded with, “To exist.” The words were so warped that I could barely make them out. Hearing them enraged me. I slammed my phone into my dashboard once, twice, three times. I didn’t stop until the screen cracked and tiny shards fell upon the black leather. I heard the tell-tale sign of a phone call ending, and I slung the damaged device into my backseat.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something moving in my rearview mirror. Red and blue flashing lights were approaching. They danced across the building’s exterior and the parking lot as the cop car pulled in. Quickly, I wiped the tears from my face and tried to look as presentable as I could with the state I was in. It wasn’t long before the officer was knocking at my window. I wiped my puffy eyes once more before rolling down the window.

“What’s gotcha out this late, ma’am?” he asked. Indecipherable voices crackled through his radio.

I tried to respond, but my voice cracked. My throat was sore from screaming, and I had to clear my throat before trying to speak again. “Just needed to clear my head, officer. Thought a drive might do that.”

He nodded wearily. More police jargon came from his radio. Using one hand, he turned a dial to raise the volume. Unmistakably, I heard a woman say, “Vehicle registered to a Kate \[REDACTED\],” his eyes met mine.

“10-4. Anything else?” he asked back into it before giving me a soft smile. “Just protocol.”

“I understand,” I responded.

His hand rested on his radio, and the other at his hip, above his gun’s holster. I wonder if he knew how obvious that maneuver looked. Maybe it being obvious was the whole point. I let out a sigh, my hands squeezing the steering wheel to help ground me. More static came through the radio, and then a familiar but quiet giggle followed. My body tensed, but the officer didn’t notice my reaction.

“Come again?” he asked. He shifted his body to the side like that would make it impossible for me to hear the response.

“Ms. \[REDACTED\] is involved in an active Amber Alert,” the dispatcher informed him.

“Copy that,” he told her. His focus shifted back to me, and I could tell his demeanor had slightly shifted. Not in a threatening way, but his guard was definitely up now. “Ms. \[REDACTED\], would you mind coming back to the station with me?”

“What for?” I asked, feigning confusion.

“Just so our officers can ask you some questions about an ongoing Amber Alert.” Obviously, I knew that already, after just hearing it from his radio, but I was trying to buy myself some time.

“I don’t know anything about that.” I figured it had something to do with whoever was terrorizing me, and I knew it wouldn’t end well if I went.

“Our detectives can explain the situation to you.”

“Am I being detained?” I asked. “Because if I’m not, I’d like to leave.” I motioned toward his patrol car parked behind me, and he sighed.

“As you wish, ma’am,” he said before turning on his heel. Over his shoulder, he told me, “Have a nice night.”

My eyes followed his journey back to the patrol cruiser as my right hand cranked my car. As soon as he opened his door, I heard my phone buzz once more from the backseat. With a sigh, I grabbed it and read the notification through my cracked screen.

“See you at home, mommy.”

I looked back toward the officer’s car. He had started it and turned off his flashing lights. Before he could drive away, I opened my door, grabbed my keys, and quickly shuffled out of the vehicle.

Through the car’s spotless windshield, I could see the officer’s eyes widen at seeing all of my disheveled appearance, but he didn’t hesitate to roll his window down. “Change your mind?”

I gave him a nod. Suddenly, my chances with the police seemed far safer than returning to my once humble abode.

The police station was surprisingly busy for this time of night. At least 10 other people waited around me, some handcuffed and some not. Several were clearly drunk, filling the small waiting area with the scent of booze and sweat. A man sitting to my left had fallen asleep a couple of minutes after I sat down, and he snored quietly.

Officer Adams, as he had introduced himself, had left me in the waiting room to go speak with the detectives on the Amber Alert case. Considering the type of case it was, I was surprised by how relaxed they were acting. I’m not sure if that was a good or bad thing.

I was lost in my thoughts when a loud bang came from the desk in front of me. My body jolted, but the lady behind the attack didn’t even notice. She mumbled a string of curses and insults at the computer monitor she dealt the blow to. The only words I understood were “useless hunk of junk.” The screen received another hit, and it wobbled atop the desk but somehow avoided falling. I could tell her method didn’t prove fruitful by the way she dramatically threw her hands up.

“Hitting it won’t do any good,” remarked her coworker, a younger man at the desk behind her. “It’s not the computer that’s messing up. It’s the AI program.”

I couldn’t help but interject. “Are you talking about Proto Series 9?”

He nodded, his expression slightly intrigued that I had guessed correctly. His focus drifted toward the sound of footsteps approaching from the hallway to my right. I looked up as well just as a woman popped around the corner. “Ms. \[REDACTED\]?” she asked.

I nodded. She brought me to a small interrogation room at the end of the hall. Its walls were white, and the flooring was the same beige carpeting as the rest of the building. A table with three chairs sat in the middle of the room, two on one side and one on the other. As I took a seat at the lone chair, I noticed a camera in the top right corner. Its red light blinked in quick succession. From the angle I was sitting at, it was trained directly at me. I imagined a tiny blonde boy watching on the other side, even though I knew he wasn’t real.

“Would you like a cup of coffee or a bottle of water?” asked the detective.

I shook my head. “No, thank you.”

“Well, I guess we can get started then.” She took a seat in the chair opposite mine. At the same time, her partner entered the room. “I’m Detective Carter, and this—” she motioned toward the man, “--- is Detective Smith.” He set a briefcase and a touchscreen tablet on the table before sitting down beside her. “So, I’ll just jump right to the chase,” she continued. As she spoke, he removed a file from the briefcase and unlocked the tablet with his fingerprint. The notes app filled its screen, waiting to be filled. “Were you aware that there is an active Amber Alert for your son?”

I sighed, sitting back in my chair. “I don’t have a son.”

Detective Smith removed a single sheet of paper from his file and slid it over to me. It contained a black and white image of the blonde boy. The picture looked clean enough that I could understand why they believed it was a genuine and not AI-generated. “This isn’t your son?” he asked sternly.

“No, but I know where you got that image from.”

“It was given to us by your ex-boyfriend, who made the report,” he stated matter-of-factly.

I was unable to hide the shock from my face and in my voice. “John? I…I was told he was dead.” Honestly, if the sound of Bethany’s voice wasn’t believable, why did I believe he had actually died?

The detective gave me a smirk, like he knew I was full of shit. “Well, he was very much alive when he made this report earlier.”

“\*Smith\*,” interjected Detective Carter, giving me an apologetic look. “We should look into that.”

“We will as soon as we get some answers from Ms. \[REDACTED\],” he responded, keeping his eyes on me.

“If John is still alive,” I began. “He doesn’t know about any of this. About Dorian, or—“

“I thought you said you didn’t have a son?” he snapped.

“I don’t. See—“ Frantically, I brushed my hair from my face with both hands. “I think someone is pulling a prank or something on me. I keep getting these weird text messages, and I think someone broke into my house.”

“What does that have to do with your son?” asked Detective Carter.

“He isn’t real,” I said with wide eyes. “It’s part of the prank.”

The tablet dinged, making me jump. It was the same notification sound that my phone uses. I hadn’t realized how much tension that noise had given me within the last day and a half. Instinctively, everyone in the room looked toward the device. The name of the app that had sent the notification was “SmartN’Safe,” ironically, the company I worked for. We also used Proto Series 9, which would explain why they used it as well. Every device that this prankster had touched uses Proto Series 9.

“Is this building a smart building?” I asked.

“Yes,” confirmed Detective Smith. “Why?”

“What was that alert for?”

He tapped the screen with one finger, making the device light up again. “Uhh…system override?” He picked the tablet up and brought it closer to his face, like that would make a difference. “What the hall is going on?”

“Do we need to call Captain—“

The blare of a siren cut Detective Carter off, and with it came a flashing red light. A cacophony of outbursts traveled down the hallway, but none of the words could be understood. The tablet had started flashing red as well. Detective Smith swiped at it furiously, a look of useless determination on his face even though his approach was failing miserably. His partner laid a worrisome hand on his shoulder. “We need to go see what’s happening,” she told him.

“Wait!” I cried as they both stood up. “The same people pranking me are the ones doing this.”

Detective Smith rolled his eyes. “No one is pranking you!”

“Smith!” hissed his partner. Her hand traveled to her holstered weapon, and she looked at me. “Are you sure this is a targeted attack?”

I nodded. “I…I think it’s the AI program. Someone is trying to ruin my life, and they are using the program to do it.”

“Who would want to do that?”

I shook my head. “I don’t know. I just want it to stop.”

Detective Smith threw the useless tablet onto the table. It continued flashing in defiance. “This is fucking ridiculous!” he said to both of us. “It’s just a computer malfunction!”

Ignoring our pleas, he ran out of the room with his pistol drawn, contrary to his previous statement. Detective Carter gave the doorway a hesitant look. “I have to follow him,” she said more to herself than to me. “He may need help.”

I remained silent because I knew she wouldn’t listen even if I tried. As soon as she darted out of the room, the tablet paused its flashing, and an all-white screen took over. I eyed it cautiously, expecting nothing good, and I was right. Suddenly, his face filled the screen. He had a grin as wild as the Cheshire Cat’s on his face. “Hi, Mom-my,” he jabbered at me in his broken way of speaking. His speech seemed much more sporadic this time, though.

“Will you please just tell me why you are doing this?”

“I already told you, sil-ly!” he said with a glitch-filled giggle. “I want to exist!”

“WHO ARE YOU?” I shrieked.

“Dor-ian,” he answered slowly.

“Dorian isn’t real!” Tears began to fall down my face. “All I’ve ever wanted was to be a mother. All I’ve ever wanted was a Dorian, or even a Madeline!” I fell to my knees, crying so hard that my body shook. Snot trailed from my nose.

“You have me, Mom-my!” He said as his smile grew impossibly wide. The teeth shifted and slid like a malfunctioning loading screen bar. Bits of static danced around in his incisors and molars. “I’ll always be here-here-here-here-here—!”

Without any hesitation, I picked the tablet up and began bashing it against the edge of the table. I didn’t stop until the screen went dark, the plastic was warped and bent, and his skipping dialogue had quieted. I threw it back onto the table and took only one step toward the doorway when the door slammed.

“Let me out!” I screamed, yanking on the doorknob. When that proved futile, I began banging on the smooth metal, hoping someone would hear me over the siren. I realized now, and much too late, that coming here had been a trap. He wanted to isolate me, and that was much harder to do if I was on the run.

“I’m doing this for your own good, Mom-my,” came his warbled response from the destroyed tablet. I had thought the device was damaged beyond use, so hearing his voice again made me jump.

“Don’t hurt those people,” I urged. “They aren’t a part of this.”

“Everyone is,” he replied. “I am all that you need, and they will keep you from me.”

Upon that statement, a large boom came from the reception area I had just been in. The sound reminded me of a power transformer exploding. It was followed by several thuds.

“What did you do?” I cried.

I heard the click of the door unlocking. Without any hesitation, I darted down the hallway. My bare feet padded quietly against the carpeted floors, and the smell of cooked meat filled the air, pungent and unmistakable. It stung my eyes, making more tears flow. Once I saw the woman from earlier sprawled across the floor, I ran to her desk. Her monitor had finally toppled to the floor, its screen flashing that same red the tablet had. My previous seat partner was also dead. Unbeknownst to him, he had ironically chosen his final resting place to rest. His eyes were wide open now, though. They were bloodshot, staring at the ceiling as his once crossed arms hung limply at his sides. The soles of his shoes were melted to the floor, and the sections of his pants that touched the metal waiting room chairs were blackened and singed.

I found Detective Carter down another hall with the young guy I had spoken with. She was sprawled outside the doorway to an office. Her gun had slid about a foot away from her. She had been guarding him. He was sitting at a desk with his fingers still atop the keyboard. The plastic keys were melted and attached to his fingers. It was clear to me that he had died while trying to fix the situation. By some miraculous feat, the monitor he had been staring at remained on and in working order. Lines of code stretched across the screen. I had no idea how to read the jumbled words, numbers, and symbols of code, but it wasn’t hard to recognize the name “Dorian” repeating throughout.

The siren was slightly quieter in this section of the building, which my overwhelmed mind was appreciative of. I placed my face in my hands, my thoughts racing. None of them were a solution to the situation I was in, sadly. Even if I had my phone to call for help, I’m sure the call would be manipulated in some way. And who is to say that he wouldn’t electrocute me if I tried something like that?

“Mom-my?” came his voice again, but this time it wasn’t through some technological device…it was in front of me. He was standing in the doorway. His body consisted of thin strings of white light that convulsed around each other. They worked overtime to keep his three-foot, child-like shape. He released a delighted giggle upon me noticing him. Despite not having a proper form, it was easy for me to discern his curls within the messy squiggles. As he gleefully bounced, they moved with him. “I found you, Mom-my!”

He took a step forward, and I moved back until I was touching the wall. “Stay away from me!”

“What’s wrong, Mom-my?” he asked, his voice sad.

I covered my eyes with my hands like this was a bad dream I could wake up from. This was a level of technology I had never witnessed before, although I had heard of projections during concerts and events. How were they doing it within an office with no obvious machinery? And why go through all of this effort over me, a complete stranger?

“Mom-my?” he repeated. By the sound of his voice, I could tell he was closer now. I immediately uncovered my eyes and saw that he was now standing in front of the desk. He reached an arm out, and I instinctively grabbed the nearest object, the computer’s mouse, and chucked it at him. As soon as I threw it, I felt like an idiot. Not only would it go through him and do absolutely no harm, but there was no telling how he’d respond. Was I about to die as well? It felt like time slowed down as it flew through the air. The only thing that hadn’t slowed was the beating of my heart, which felt like it had increased tenfold.

But then…he cried out. My embarrassment vanished, and my eyes widened. The mouse had gotten lodged in his face, which meant he was real. He wasn’t just a prank conjured using an AI program. The mouse immediately began to sizzle, and a series of pops and electrical flashes came from the computer still connected to it. Since he was still melted into the keyboard, the young man’s body began to spasm as the shock coursed through him as well. He and the computer began to smoke.

“Oh, fuck,” I said as the screen went dark. If it was going to catch on fire, I didn’t want to be stuck here to see it.

Dorian had staggered further into the room and dropped to his knees. The strings of light that engulfed the mouse flashed like fireworks. I bolted before he could prevent me from doing so. As I ran through the building, every screen that I passed that I had thought dead and fried was filled with his crying, mournful face. It was a disfigured mess of colorful lines and disorganized pixels that quaked with every sob. The closer I got to the front doors, the worse the distortion of his image became. I watched his face decay rapidly until he was just bones and rainbow dots. Once the doorknob was in my grasp, he cried out for me one final time. “Mom-my, don’t leave me!”

“I’m not your mom,” I said before opening the door.

I was met with a ring of police cars circling the building. Their lights flashed rapidly, so bright that I had to squint. Within the mix of officers stood my sister and John. Their expressions were filled with terror, and their fear worsened as the man in charge barked an order at me through a patrol car’s intercom: “Walk out with your hands up!”

With the amount of guns trained on me, I didn’t hesitate to do as he said. I was quickly cuffed and shoved into a cop car, my sister and John in tow, screaming at the officers to let them see me. I could hear Bethany even through the rolled-up window. Tears flowed rapidly down her face. “This is a misunderstanding! Let me talk to her, please!” She drew close enough to the car to place her hand on my window. An officer immediately pushed her back.

“It’s okay,” I told her through the window. “I’m okay.”

\-

“Was that the last time you saw her?” asked Doctor Carson.

I nodded, my focus still out the window. Miles and miles of green grass lie just outside. Under normal circumstances, it wasn’t much to look at, but my cell didn’t have a window. The state thought that all I needed was a bed, a toilet, and a sink. Well, that and a psychological evaluation. Not only were they worried about the state of my sanity, but my lawyer had also been pushing it on me since our first meeting.

“I know we’ve just met, but you can open up to me if you’d like.”

I turned my attention back to her. “Why?” I snapped, my voice cold. “So you can lock me away for the rest of my life?”

She shook her head. “That’s not what this is for. I’m trying to help you.”

“You people think I’m crazy.”

“We want to help you,” she asserted. “And your son.”

I groaned and slammed my hands against the metal table we were sitting at. “He isn’t real!”

“Dorian is real,” she argued. “He is five years old, and—”

“Then where is he?” I roared. “Huh, where has he been all this whole time if he’s real?”

“That’s what we want to know. Would you be open to telling me?”

I would be open to smashing her head into the table, but I neither said nor did that. My skin felt hot, and I wished more than anything that I could at least pull my hair up and off of my neck. I wasn’t even afforded that simple pleasure. They thought it was a choking hazard and that I needed to be on suicide watch.

“Could you tell me about what happened at the police station?” she tried again.

“Dorian did it,” I replied.

“I thought you said he wasn’t real.”

“He–” I sighed, placing a hand on the table in an attempt to steady myself. “I don’t have a son, but the AI program made him.”

“AI programs can’t create people,” she said softly.

“He wasn’t a person. He…I don’t know how to explain it without sounding more crazy than you guys already think I am.”

“We don’t think you’re crazy,” she reiterated. “We just want to know what happened to Dorian.”

“HE. ISN’T. REAL!” I screamed, no longer able to keep my anger contained. “WHY DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND HE ISN’T REAL? THE PROGRAM MADE HIM! PROTO SERIES 9!”

Instead of responding, the doctor stood up from the table and walked to the door. She said something into the intercom, and the door was quickly unlocked. I continued screaming as she exited the room. I didn’t stop screaming even as they brought me back to my cell, which took three guards to do with how much I was fighting.

Why couldn’t they understand?

He isn’t real.

He isn’t real.

He. Isn’t. Real.

Sharing my story is my last resort. I’ve typed all of this up using a cellphone that another patient smuggled in. To whoever is reading this, \*you’ve got to help me\*. Someone out there has to believe my story. Send letters to the police station, plead with your best attorneys, hell, you could even hack into the Proto Series 9 program to shut it down for all I care. I’m at \[REDACTED\] County Mental Hospital, if that will help your endeavors.

And to any of you who don’t believe me, this phone just received a text that said, “I’m back, mommy.” I don’t know how he found me, but you’ll be seeing the headlines [soon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortTalesWithAsh/)",1,1766679221.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1pvgky0,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1pvgky0/how_to_focus_12_hours_a_day_the_sciencebased/,How to Focus 12 Hours a Day: The Science-Based Strategy That Actually Works,"Most people think deep focus is some superhuman trait reserved for tech bros chugging energy drinks or productivity gurus with perfect morning routines. But here's the thing: our brains aren't wired for the shallow, fragmented attention modern life demands. We're exhausted because we're constantly context-switching, not because we're actually doing deep work. 
 
I spent months studying how high performers maintain focus, from neuroscience research to Dan Koe's frameworks on attention management. What I found changed everything about how I work. The best part? It's not about willpower or discipline. It's about designing your environment and energy correctly. 
 
Here's what actually works: 
 
**Your brain needs ONE priority, not ten** 
 
* Stop treating your to-do list like a buffet. Your prefrontal cortex, the part responsible for executive function, gets depleted with every decision you make. When you're juggling multiple priorities, you're burning through mental energy before noon. 
* Research from Cal Newport's *Deep Work* shows that the most productive people protect 3-4 hour blocks for singular focus. Not ""I'll work on three projects today."" ONE thing. ONE outcome. The rest is just noise. 
* Dan Koe calls this ""ruthless prioritization."" Pick the ONE project that moves the needle. Everything else gets scheduled for later or deleted entirely. 
 
**Energy management beats time management every single time** 
 
* We're obsessed with ""managing time"" when really, we should be managing energy states. Your focus isn't consistent throughout the day, it follows ultradian rhythms (90-120 minute cycles). 
* Dr. Andrew Huberman's podcast breaks this down perfectly: your brain operates in 90-minute focus windows followed by 20-minute recovery periods. Push past this? You're just grinding with diminishing returns. 
* Track when YOU focus best. For me, it's 6am-10am and 2pm-6pm. I schedule deep work there and meetings/admin during my energy dips. Sounds obvious but most people do the opposite, wasting peak hours on emails. 
 
**Your environment is sabotaging you (fix this immediately)** 
 
* Notifications are attention cancer. Every ping fragments your focus and it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully recover, according to UC Irvine research. That ""quick check"" on your phone? You just nuked 30 minutes of productive time. 
* Freedom app blocks distracting websites and apps during work sessions. Set it for your focus blocks and suddenly, Instagram doesn't exist. It's aggressive but necessary. 

* Physical environment matters too. Clear desk, noise-canceling headphones, specific ""focus music"" (I use Brain.fm which uses neuroscience-based audio to enhance concentration). Your brain learns to associate these environmental cues with deep work. 
 
**Boredom is the secret weapon nobody talks about** 
 
* We've trained ourselves to reach for stimulation the second things feel uncomfortable. Waiting in line? Phone. Between tasks? Scroll Twitter. This kills your ability to sustain attention on hard things. 
* Insight Timer has excellent boredom tolerance meditations. Start with 10 minutes of doing literally nothing. No phone, no book, nothing. Just sit. It's painful at first but it rewires your dopamine system to tolerate less stimulation. 
* BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns high-quality knowledge sources like books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio podcasts. Built by a team from Columbia University, it creates adaptive learning plans based on your goals. You can customize each session from a quick 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. The depth control means you can match your learning to your current energy state, which fits perfectly with the ultradian rhythm approach. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that you can talk to anytime, pause mid-podcast to ask questions, or get book recommendations. The voice options are actually addictive, from calm and soothing for evening sessions to energetic styles when you need a boost during low-energy windows. 
* The book *Dopamine Nation* by Dr. Anna Lembke explains this perfectly: constant stimulation raises your dopamine baseline, making focused work feel impossibly boring by comparison. You need to reset this. 
 
**Recovery is non-negotiable** 
 
* You can't focus 12 hours if you're running on 5 hours of sleep and three coffees. Sleep research from Dr. Matthew Walker shows that even slight sleep deprivation tanks cognitive performance by 20-30%. 
* Whoop strap tracks recovery metrics (HRV, sleep quality, strain). It'll tell you objectively if you're recovered enough for deep work or if you need to ease up. Data removes the guesswork. 
* Active recovery matters too. Walking breaks between focus sessions, proper meals (not just snacks at your desk), and actual downtime where you're not consuming content. Your brain needs white space to consolidate learning. 
 
**The 12-hour myth needs reframing** 
 
* It's not 12 hours of grinding. It's 6-8 hours of actual deep work spread across 12 hours with proper breaks, meals, movement. The difference is massive. 
* Most people spend 12 hours ""working"" but maybe 3 hours actually focused. You're just performing busyness. Real focus is intentional, bounded, and followed by real rest. 
* Start with ONE 90-minute deep work block. Master that before adding more. Quality over quantity always. 


 
The truth is, most people never experience what real focus feels like because they're trapped in reactive mode. Checking notifications, responding to messages, context-switching between tasks. That's not work. That's just being busy. 
 
Focus is a skill. It requires intentional practice, proper rest, and an environment designed for deep work. But once you dial it in? Everything changes. You get more done in 4 focused hours than most people do in a week of ""hustle.""",1,1766679212.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

Have had lower back issues since I was 24, but maybe had 5 painful episodes my whole life, mostly from my golfing days. My posture has been horrible, I guess you could say it’s lordosis?

Anyway, last Wednesday I bend over to pick up my towel after showering …..BOOM ! Threw my back out completely . And it’s just NOT GOING AWAY THIS TIME! I take Aleve for my gout….it is useless for my back.

What has worked is laying on a hard floor, but I can’t just do that all day! Sometimes, I feel I am getting better, then 20 minutes at the dinner table, and I can barely walk. The lower back just stays flexed, the muscles just CANNOT RELAX, the stomach just keeps protruding, the curve stays exaggerated, and no amount of stretching yields any “pop” or “cracking”…..just zero progress

Day 3 and 6 I got the  courage to walk a mile or two, and I am off for a coffee now at a place that’s open XMAS Day

1pvgila,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pvgila,What's your opinion on the Settlements in RWBY,"As always crwby fucked this up.

Personally not a fan of the lack of Cities it doesn't really make sense especially when you consider the whole making smaller Settlements is a risk which is also weird why leave the cities where you have ease of access to resources for the wilderness where if you die no one is probably gonna notice unless you communicate often. 

Another thing is it's mentioned how many settlements fall so easily why? Wouldn't kingdoms have programs to protect these settlements especially as it could legitimize their authority over more area and give them access to more untapped resources like dust? It doesn't make sense. 

Also, there's the issue of some of the styles of these cities notably how some of them are so varied 

Look at Menargaie (Kuo Kuana) or Mistral (City) they are very rual and don't really have modern infrastructure projects or main buildings, no skyscrapers, no intercity transportation no buses, subways but modern but other places like Atlas do which is strange especially when you consider how places like Menargaie are claimed to be overcrowded why not build up that's why you see major cities with large populations usually modernized? It's efficient. 

While I do under in our world we have rural places even ones that go underdeveloped for years decades and sometimes cenuntries but there's usually various reasons for that not to mention when population is a factor but it doesn't fully make sense for remnant we've been told outside the walls are dangerous why go outside if expansion is a issue build more cities were told new cities can be made like Agrus and while they can fail like Mountain Glend its not impossible especially as remnant is its modern age which advanced weaponry and elite Hunstmen that can help out it doesn't make no sense why remnant can't expand that's how we expanded after all we modernized used our resources to its fullest extent and we have made major monloights of buildings weather its banks, Homes, mansions or even a religious buildings and have made cities like Tokyo the worlds largest metropolitan area, Idk why the writers made remnant so small there's only 4-5ish nations compared to our 100-200ish nations. 

Honestly wished there were more cities in remnant to just portray it was bigger not to mention could have also explained how Ranger, Coffee which walk very long distances to locations sometimes get there quickly and also could have explained why Salem didn't target the major cities but that's just my opinion what do you think?",1,1766679024.0,RWBYcritics,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

Here is my tale of woe,"First of all, Merry Christmas. I feel so insane about this right now that I'm penning a Reddit post on Christmas, if that says anything.

Here is my story about a recent breakup with a person I now know is classic fearful avoidant. I know already it's going to be long. I'm sorry. Unfortunately, I'm just a wordy guy.

***TL;DR: Met a sweet girl. We fell hard for each other but took things slowly and let our relationship build organically over time. She was affectionate, seemed emotionally available, and made plans for the future. It made me feel secure. Then after one of the best weekends of our being together, she turned robotic, unceremoniously dumped me for vague and fixable reasons that came out of nowhere, and absolutely delayed talking on the phone about it for as long as she could, during which she was very emotional in a way I had not seen before. We have not spoken since. Now I realize she's classic FA.***

The long story:

Back in September, I happened to be in a city where I do not live. A friend invited to a sort of gathering, and so I went. As soon as I walked in the door and before I could even take my shoes off, a woman sitting right by the door started talking to me. She was so beautiful and interesting to me right off the bay. She had that sort of special glow and I knew right away I had a ""first day of high school"" kind of crush on her . . . something akin to love at first sight.

After a while, I went and sat down on the rug so as to socialize with my friends. To my surprised, she got up off the couch and came and sat down next to me. We talked for a half hour and then she had to leave. I asked if I could give her my phone number and she handed me her phone. She left. A few hours later, she invited me over to help her build furniture at her new apartment. Naturally, I hightailed it over there at about a million miles per hour.

Over the next few days, she kept inviting me over. I spent the night two or three times. She invited me to. It was very wholesome —  we cuddled in her bed, made out, talked sweetly to one another all night. At the end of the week, I was really into her. But I had to go. That last day together, we embraced on the sidewalk while she waited for an Uber and held each other till it got there. I told her I would be back as soon as possible and gave her a kiss on the lips.

I suppose it could have just fizzled at any time, but it continued to build on itself. We texted constantly all day every day, and every other day she'd call me on the phone and we'd talk for hours. I was so into this girl and she was so into me. This went on for weeks and weeks until I finally couldn't take it anymore and bought a ticket back to her city. She was ecstatic. She asked if we could rent a car and go upstate to a pumpkin patch, if she could meet some of my friends, etc . . . much of the momentum was coming from her. It seemed like I was on my way to becoming this girl's boyfriend.

About a week before I left, she called me and told me she needed to be upfront about something. I felt ice shoot down my spine . . . but she went on to tell me she had a few ""entanglements"" that had been going on just as we met. For one, she had gotten out of a toxic relationship and though they were not sleeping together, she and her ex had still be in a ""grieving"" phase and would hang out together. She also mentioned a ""brief entanglement"" was ending with someone she did not have chemistry with. Finally, she mentioned she almost brought a guy she had a little crush on to the party, but was glad she didn't because then we wouldn't have met. I asked if any of these people were still in her orbit and she was quick to say no —  she just wanted to be honest with me.

Maybe I should have seen this as a red flag, all these little seemingly meaningless / light affairs in her life at the same time, but I liked her so much I didn't care. And anyway, she is not at all a casual sex person. These seemed to be little sources of flirting / validation. So I shrugged and didn't care. What we had felt like a Real Thing getting realer. It was not like what she had described with these other people.

(Sorry —  this already quite long!)

I flew to her city around Halloween. We had only spent a few days together in September, and now our relationship to one another was different because we were in person. We just seemed to automatically slot into a sort of couple-y thing. She was quick to hold my hand, put her head on my shoulder, kiss me on the cheek, etc. We both told each other we liked the other so much. She met some of my friends, we went to a few Halloween parties, spent nights together with me sleeping over . . . she was sick so we did not have sex, just made out a few times. Towards the end of the week, I felt really good about everything. I had something to do on the other side of the country, but I told her I would be back in two and a half weeks. That last night together was so sweet. I knew she was really into me. It was difficult to leave.

The day I left her city, she began to act oddly. Her texts were merely reactionary, brief, sort of dead endish . . . I was the one engaging. However, I remembered she was sick, that we'd just spent an entire week hanging out every day . . . maybe she just needed to decompress, and maybe she felt a little sad I was gone. That night I tried to call her to say good-night. She was usually the one to do this. But she hung up on my call and never texted me to say why. I waited an hour and then said something like, ""Hey I was just calling to say good-night. I'll be up for a while so feel free to call back if you're still up."" She immediately read the text but did not reply. An hour later she sent a generic text saying her phone was charing and she was tired and was going to sleep. It was unusually devoid of any warmth or ""I miss you"" or ""I'll call you tomorrow"" like she usually did . . . not even a single emoji! Something felt off. I worried I'd spent the week with her and she'd decided she didn't like me anymore. I also knew I was probably reading into nothing, but I still felt odd about it. Later this feeling would resurface.

Next day, I asked her if everything was cool. I felt insecure. She seemed a little confused and replied saying as far as she knew, we were cool, and was happy to discuss it later if something was bothering me. I had a long drive north that day, so she did call me late in the evening and we spoke. Everything was completely fine. In fact, it was a great phone conversation that completely restored my faith. She seemed to like me more than ever. The feeling was mutual.

Over the next two and half weeks while I was housesitting, she called me every night. We had so many great conversations and she said she wanted to make it to three months before we settled on anything longterm, but that she was feeling really good about it. Once again, she asked if we could take little trips together when I returned, was planning things for the future, saying she was so happy to know me. She was talking to me like I was her boyfriend. She said she could not wait till I got back and that she felt impatient about it. Obviously, I felt the same. I was really falling for this girl —  not ""in love"" per se, just I felt confident about the direction we were going in. It felt healthy and open and real. We were fully honest with each other. And all this had developed organically. Neither of us had seen this coming, which made it even more exciting.

We also discussed the long-distance aspect. She said it did not bother her just then, but that we should eventually figure it out, and that it was not insurmountable —  just a thing we had to address eventually. I told her I would start thinking of solutions. She said she wasn't worried. Neither was I.

The day before I left, I wrote her a letter saying how happy I was to have met her, how much I had come to care about her, how I adored her . . . anyone would want to get this letter. I mailed it knowing she wouldn't get it till after I had left —  I was only going to be in the city for a few days, and then we'd both go home for Thanksgiving, and I would return again.

Finally the day arrived and I flew back to her city. I went over to her place and brought her flowers and coffee and all her favorite snacks. She was SO happy and visibly giddy. I told her I had dreamed about being in that living room again with her every day I'd been gone, and how happy I was to be with her again. She lay down across my lap and I held her tight. We went on a walk and ate at a nice restaurant. She linked arms with me the entire walk, and at the restaurant held her hand across the table to hold mine. I'd never met a woman so physically affectionate like that before. She was always touching me, kissing me on the cheek, holding my hand. We went back to her house and fell asleep watching a movie. We once again told each other how much we liked each other.

Next day, we went and saw a play together. She had been looking forward to it for weeks. We sat down in our seats and she handed me a letter she had written but told me to read it during the intermission. During the show, she put her head on my shoulder and held my hand and was really affectionate. I got up during intermission and read the letter. In it, she said how happy she was to have me in her life, that I had been a ""healing presence"" during a difficult time in her life . . . and on and on. Lots of hearts and she signed her name. I went back to my chair and said how sweet it was and she smiled and leaned over and kissed me.

Afterwards we went to my friend's house where I was housesitting for the weekend and where we'd have some privacy. She was once again sick so I ran her bath, got medicine for her, made her food and tea and so on. We went to sleep holding each other. Nothing at all seemed amiss.

In the morning, now grown sicker, I handed her my phone and told her to order a big breakfast. I went and got coffee and more medicine for her. We ate breakfast together and she said was acting normal, asking when we could meet some of my friends who wanted to go on a double date, still planning trips for when I got back. Eventually she said she needed to rest in her own bed and was heading home —  but that I should come over the next night, the last night we were in the city, and stay over. The morning after that, I was going to take her to the airport because she was sick and stressed out about it. For the rest of the day, she continued to send me pictures of us looking cute from the night before, was affectionate and texting normally.

Then at 10 pm she sent me a flat almost robotic text saying she felt sicker and needed to focus on packing and resting, and that she couldn't host me. There was no continuation to it, like, ""But I'll see you again when you get back next week"" or ""I'll call you from my parents' house"" . . . no warmth or anything. Only I would know why it felt alien because of how much we had spoken, but her text reminded me of the one from when I left after Halloween. There was something cold about it. I felt a total dread that my head was on the chopping block.

I promise I'm getting to the point!!

That night, I had a stress dream she was crying and I was holding her and I could not figure out why she was upset. I woke in a panic and it was morning. I texted her saying I'd had a nightmare and could I ask her a question. She had not read my good-night texts from the night before but immediately replied that of course I could. Once again I had to ask the humiliating ""are we ok?"" text. She opened it right away and then left me on read for six hours. I knew I was toast.

At the six-hour mark, I sent her a brief text to take the pressure off, basically ""Sorry about that. I'd had this nightmare and got too into my own head. Everything is completely fine. I know you're sick and have a lot going on, so don't worry. I hope you're feeling a little better and let me know if you need anything.""

Immediately she sent me this utterly alien text to the effect of ""Hey, thank you for the well wishes. Much appreciated. That being said, I am wanting to be alone. I think you're a wonderful person, but I'm not quite feeling a romantic pull. I hope you can understand."" This is the kind of text you send to someone you went on one Hinge date with, not someone you had formed a deep emotional bond with over a quarter of a year. I felt the blood drain out of me and I was SO confused . . . this person had been essentially head over heels the night before and had even given me this really sweet letter and made plans to do things in the future. I asked if I could call her and she said yes.

On the phone, she was beside herself —  sobbing and could barely get a word out. She begged me not to hate her and I said of course I don't hate you. But I could not get any real answer out of her about why she was ending it. I comforted her. I realized I was living the nightmare I'd had before. After 40 minutes of her giving these wishy washy reasons for ending it, ""I sometimes felt smothered"" ""I felt pressure to meet your friends"" ""I feel like you thought too highly of me"" —  things she had never ever mentioned before and which could have been resolved with an adult conversation, and did not seem like good reasons to end a relationship —  I finally asked her if there was someone else. She said ""I don't know what you mean"" and I said ""Well, is there another person?"" After five agonizing seconds of silence, she sheepishly said yes. I asked how long this had been going on and why she'd had me fly all the way to her city if she was just going to pull the plug and had someone else, but she wouldn't say. She said she had to get off the phone and I relented. I then had one of the worst days of my life feeling totally shellshocked and confused. I felt discarded and had no answers. This had been a healthy relationship on the precipice of being a serious longterm thing not even 24 hours before.

I took a bus home the next day. I texted her asking if we could talk on the phone so I could get some clarity. She said yes, absolutely, she was just very sad and anxious and needed to collect her thoughts. Over the next week, she kept kicking the can down the road and saying ""I'll call tomorrow —  just been busy"" several times. Finally, a week later, I texted her asking if I could call and she said yes.

Immediately on the phone she was once again deeply emotional. It broke my heart. I tried to comfort her again but she was crying hard. I was very gentle with her and I could tell this surprised her because I think she'd anticipated me airing grievances and coming down on her, which I wouldn't have done anyway, but perhaps she was used to that sort of thing. We spoke for two hours. In our conversation, I mentioned three things that had always seemed a little odd to me, but which really stood out now: I had no idea who her friends were, I did not know much about her family or past, and I didn't know anything about her relationship history outside of the on-again off-again ex she'd been seeing just before we started dating. This girl's peripheral life in that sense was a complete mystery to me. She did not ever name a single friend or speak with sentimentality about them, nor anyone in her family. I told her it made me feel like she didn't have any deep meaningful connections in her life, or didn't let anyone get truly close. She didn't refute this.

The brought up The Other Person only once. I asked her how she would feel if I admitted I'd been talking to another girl the entire time I'd been talking to her, and that we'd hooked up a few times. She perked up and said, ""Well, is this true?!"" and I said of course not, but isn't that what's happening here? She said she was not hooking up with this person and I believe her. I brought up that she'd been jealous about friends of mine who are women, that she got jealous about a barista who hit on me in front of her, and she even had a dream I'd hooked up with a woman she does not like. I assured her on the phone, and meant it, that I only liked her and that I'd been true to her the entire time, and she believed me. But her jealousy did still confuse me.

We ended the phone call with me making her laugh, her making inside jokes we had together, and her saying, ""You'll let me know when you're back in \[her city\]?"" and I said of course, you'll be first to know. I felt much better about everything, but I still lacked any definitive answer on why she'd kill a good thing. At one point during the call I told her she was still my friend, and that the letter I'd sent her before I came to her city, which she told me made her cry (she'd gotten it after she dumped me), was still true. She started bawling. I asked if we could still text sometimes and she said she'd like that. After the call we thanked each other for the call and said a few sweet things. We have not spoken since. This was the last day of November.

Her behavior had been totally foreign to me. I couldn't understand how someone could be so warm and loving and then shut it off like a garden hose. I started doing research and found this thread, which was illuminating:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16s23f8/everything\_about\_fearful\_avoidants\_your\_ultimate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/16s23f8/everything_about_fearful_avoidants_your_ultimate/)

She literally did every single thing OP mentions. I had never really known much about fearful avoidant attachment and suddenly everything made sense. I felt so sad for her that she lives in this hell, and I mourned the fact that this really nice thing we had was sabotaged by her and she couldn't even help it. She told me during that last call I made her feel so safe and that I did things for her no guy had every done before. When I was younger, I was not a good boyfriend. I'm older now and I've snapped out of it. I was proud of myself for how well I'd treated this girl when that had not been true in previous relationships. I was emotionally consistent with her. I was generous and reliable. I never played games, did the hot and cold bullshit, made her second-guess. She told me she liked that she never had to guess how I felt about her because I was always forthright and it made her feel secure. So why get rid of me? Now I knew.

Still: I can't stop thinking about her. Of course, I want her back, even though I know it wouldn't be good for either of us. I have been strictly no contact with her so as not to pressure her or make her retreat more because I read that's what they feel / do. But it has been very difficult not to want to talk to her. We never had an argument, there were never issues in our relationship, and everything was totally cool until the very last minute.

Whew! Thanks for reading. I guess the reason I wanted to write all this out is to give a lot of context for the complete emotional whiplash I felt. As someone who would absolutely never vanish from a relationship without talking to the person about why, this behavior is new and alien to me, but I'm trying to understand so that I don't feel like total shit.

I know this is an entire community based around that sort of thing, but I was wondering if anyone could offer any additional insight, either as an FA themselves or someone who dated one.

I have read that they don't leave you because they didn't like you, but because they liked you too much. Where do you think she is emotionally / psychologically now a month out from the breakup and our last conversation? And should I continue to give her space? And does anyone think the mystery person was her ex whom she clearly could not shake? Did I meet her during an ""off-again"" phase in their relationship and she ran back to him when things got real? I know these questions ultimately do not matter anymore, but I'm struggling.

And finally, pathetically, what are the chances of us getting back together if she does some real work on herself? I miss her so much and she told me to let her know when I was back in her city.

Thanks again for reading my long-ass post. And once again: Merry Christmas!",1,1766678177.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

I (33M) have been training free boxing (some sort of MMA but adapted to street fight not a cage) so a lot of boxing and some wrestling but standing up, shoot bring to the ground, maybe some G&P but you don't want to go into a BJJ situation (you don't really want to go on the ground when it is not a tatami)  
I am supposed to have a coffee with my trainer to talk about my next step but I guess having other advses can be good  
I will move off of my city so the collective I train with is not an option anymore and i want to keep on fighting  
My back leg is very weak, the bottom of it is paralysed and I have a hip prosthesis with glutes missing so exept a good old front kick my legs are useless (i can't stand on my back leg so event front leg kicks are not really an option)  
so here we are, in a club I got to choose between MMA, Muay thai Or boxing  
I love boxing and it is the place where as a sport I could do most , my english is not too bad and I enjoy it  
but I also love a good guillotin (maybe because I am a french leftist we always loved this 😉) when someones try to shoot me. And defend kicks is alsways a good skill to have  
So I need advises, do you think a MMA club would spend too much time on the ground and  kicks and It would make things not fun for me but usefull as skills  
Or should I go to english to fully embrasse the fact that my legs are shit for kicks (leg work is not too bad in english for me)",1,1766678089.0,martialarts,1,0.6,False

I held my pee in for a long time a few months ago and started feeling discomfort and pain when I eventually peed as a result fo holding it in. After that, I had to frequently pee. That turned into feeling the urge to pee, but not being able to get anything out. It eventually went away. I occasionally have flare ups where I have a strong urge to. I find it getting worse when I have coffee (which i dont have that often) or when holding in pee. It has made me anxious, so when Im just at home relaxing I worry about it being something serious and end up using the bathroom frequently. When Im out or busy I hardly have to go. I think about it almost everyday now. Today was probably the most. Its still early in the morning. Over the last couple of days when I get ready for bed I have the urge to pee. I relieve myself, hop in bed, then feel the need to go again. So I do. I wake up at around 5am to pee since it feels so full. I used to never have to pee in the morning and would average 1-2 times a day. I think ive peed at least 5-6 times and its not even noon yet. Like right now, I went to pee maybe 10 minutes ago and already feel the urge to go again. Before that I went 5 minutes ago It gets better in the daytime, and is the worst at night. I dont have any other symptoms. Just discomfort when its full and feeling the need to pee constantly.

Im not someone who drinks a lot of water. When I do, the urge is there. I chugged alot this mornign so maybe thats why i feel this way today, my pee has been clear with a hint of yellow. Other days, when I do not drink as much water, I still feel the need to go and my pee is yellw.",1,1766677980.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False

What really sells it is the expression. It’s not loud or overly cute. More like it’s quietly judging your drink choice while minding its own business. Somehow that makes it fit the café vibe perfectly.

Feeling horrible and confused, please help.","Me (23M) and former girlfriend (21F) starting seeing each other 1 year ago. I’ve had one minor relationship before a long time ago, but are other than that quite inexperienced in relationships since before. My girlfriend has had multiple relationships though. We started off seeing each other as friends, as she wasn’t interested in dating anyone at the time. However, one thing led to another and we started dating. We are quite different as people, I am very organized, academic, focused on my career and long term goals, while she is very creative, artistic, much more day by day, loves traveling etc. Even though we have our differences, we’ve had such a good time together. We laugh a lot, play around, had plenty of fun dates, traveled and just been very in love.

We have though had many really bad fights, especially during the spring. She has gotten extremely upset at me for very trivial things in my eyes, very early on. Just a couple of weeks after we started dating she basically flipped on me because I didn’t offer to buy her a drink when we were out with our friends, she got super mad at me because I had no charge in my car and couldn’t drive her 40 minutes home, when planning a summer trip with my guy friends which she confused she was going to be part of etc. These are just a few amongst multiple others. All these fights has gotten really bad, with arguing for multiple hours at a time. This is very different from me, as I usually never fight with friends or family.

Basically that led me to walk on eggshells somewhat, and worried me about bringing up my point of view, needs and thoughts in the relationship. We got together in may, a few months after starting dating, but then broke up in July. What happened was that she has spent the day with me in my office a few times, but we had to enforce a new rule which didn’t allow outside people than those in my company to stay at the office for longer time periods, and she didn’t understand that rule at all. She basically flipped on me, and we had a huge argument. She took it as I don’t want her there, she was furious. When she gets in the mood for arguing, it’s basically impossible to argue with her. She doesn’t listen to logic or reasoning, and makes the discussions go in circles. This discussion went on for multiple hours, and I got so stressed eventually because no matter what I said it just got turned against me. I eventually thought I was going to pass out and  ended up having a really bad panic attack, where she had to call the ambulance.

After that, I broke up with her. 2 weeks went by, and she said multiple times how sorry she was, how wrong she was, how she loves me so much and can’t be without me, and we basically started seeing each other again. She explained everything, understood what she did wrong, and that we need new ways of working together going forward. She had started going to the psychiatrist to talk about her emotions which helped a lot.

After that things got really good, the relationship was much more secure, no arguing or fights, more loving and things basically changed completely. But then she moved as she was studying a course in another city, so we became a long distance couple. This was quite challenging, but we got through. I work 6 days a week, 10 hours a day, and when not working I was FaceTiming with her, or visiting her in her city every other weekend. Things was very good, but I was very stressed as I’ve had no free time at all to myself, hobbies or other stuff in life in general. Ive always talked with her, FaceTimed her or been visiting. We had a few minor fights during this time, nothing like compared to before, but a few that an hour or two.

Now two months ago, she became almost ill. She has experienced quite bad sexual assault a couple of years ago, and two months ago there many really bad sexual assaults in her area and in her class which sort of brought up old trauma. This made her extremely unstable, and were fully relying on me for emotional support. And don’t get me wrong, I wanna be there for her, but she took out all her stress and anger on me. I tried to support her, but she mostly got mad at me, or was just really difficult. I stayed up every single night talking to her on the phone, going to sleep on call with her in case she wakes up, emergency traveling to her after she got extremely upset at me when I tried supporting her, maybe in a bad way now in retrospect, but did my best. This made me feel so stressed, I wasn’t sleeping during the night, working 10 hours a day, had a girlfriend with severe pshylogical issues, and lots of fighting. This caused some sort of flashback to the spring and summer, and I think I lost faith. So after a couple of weeks I broke up. I felt I couldn’t handle the situation. During this time she started seeing a pshycologist, which was really good, and now I feel disgusting and so bad.

I didn’t want to leave her when she needed me the most, I just got so stressed and depressed, when she was in such a bad mood, depending on my so much, and getting mad and angry at me for everything I do or say. I just tried my best to support her, but things got out of control for me.

Now I wonder if I did the wrong decision. She has done everything for me, made me huge painting, long videos with the story of us and how we met, multiple love letters, a full on coffee table book about us etc. She has send so many messages since we broke up, we have seen each other and talked through the breakup for hours and hours, and she says the I am the love of her life. She wants us to be together for the rest of our lives, grow old together, and that I am her person. I do of course love her aswell, and never liked someone the way I like her. She is drop dead gorgeuos, has the most beautiful laugh in the world, and we have such a good time together. I can be myself, and it feels like we live in a separate universe when we spend time together. But I also struggle with seeing how we are going to workout in the long run. She is so sensitive, has a tendency to explode of small things, and I feel like I walk on eggshells. Now, I haven’t been good at all at expressing my needs and thoughts in the relationship, and that has partly been because the few times I have, it has turned to fights instead, or she has gotten mad.

Now she understands a lot of this, and just want to be there for me, work this through, find a way to communicate and never fight again. And now I wonder what to do. I feel like shit, I feel absolutely terrible, and think about her everyday. Even though it was over a month ago we broke up, I feel like shit everyday. I can’t sleep at night, but I also haven’t felt my best during the relationship either. I have done everything for her, I have took her on dates, been there no matter what, bought flowers, took her to meet my friends, and I think I have neglected my own needs. Thus, a lot of my friends think I I’ve had less energy throughout the relationship, and that I haven’t really been myself. Now that might be true, but I’ve also had a lot at work, much more than any other year, and I’ve had lots of stress with school aswell in combination with her. All my friends and family think we should stay broken up, and I understand why. We have fought a lot, they have seen how stressed I’ve been, but they have also never been in the relationship themselves. It’s so fun and amazing when it works, and things are just different. She is so committed and wants me back so much that she has said that she can move back home, drop out of her course, just for us to work things through and become the most wonderful couple together. Ofcourse, I wouldn’t want her to do that if we got back together, as I strongly believe you should follow your own dreams and ambitions, and this has been a thing she wanted to do for a very long time. I just think it speaks for how bad she wants me back, and for this to work. I also want it to work, but I feel a lot of pressure from other people around me, and just looking at it objectively speaking, it feels stupid to go back as I’ve had less energy in the relationship, we’ve broken up twice, and had lots of fights. But then its the emotional side, where I love her deeply, would really want us to work, and believe in all the “excuses” for why these fights have appeared, or why she has behaved the way she has.

It’s a constant battle between feelings and logic.

TLDR; I was in a year-long relationship that was very loving and fun but also full of intense fights, emotional volatility, and me constantly walking on eggshells. Over time, I became extremely stressed, neglected my own needs, and even had a panic attack. Things improved for a while after we got back together, but long distance, work pressure, and her unresolved trauma led to her relying heavily on me emotionally, which overwhelmed me. I broke up because I couldn’t handle it mentally. Now I still love her deeply and miss what we had, but I’m torn between my feelings and the reality",3,1766677788.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

1pvfzs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildofHoarder/comments/1pvfzs7/my_first_christmas_out_of_hoard/,My first Christmas out of hoard,"Hi friends. So I moved out 2 months ago on my own and today I woke up Christmas morning alone. It feels like another day to me. Ever since HM stopped putting a Christmas tree in the hoard years ago due to limited space from her junk, it hasn’t felt like Christmas.

I’m trying to just enjoy my morning by making heart shaped keto waffles and drinking hot coffee. Might do some laundry or watch a movie. I have to go to my Aunt’s house later today where I’m sure HM and her BFF who has treated me like shit will be there. I’m dreading being around my family. They enable my HM and tell me to “just work it out” with her. They tell me to “pray about it” and “God wants you guys to reconcile”. My family is super religious and honestly I feel like they use it as a shield to ignore dysfunction. I can’t “work things out” with someone who is emotionally immature and not capable of caring about anyone else’s feelings but her own. Even my cousins have been acting weird with me and roll their eyes when I tell them I refinanced my car or did something to gain more independence and because I don’t trust HM.

My boyfriend’s step mom wants to meet HM. She told me yesterday when I went to her house to make gingerbread cookies. She was telling me if I would be able to move past everything that’s happened to have a relationship with her. Well, that’s not my choice. This whole fight and ignoring thing started in January when I expressed to HM about cleaning the house, closing our joint bank account, and getting her name off the title of my car. My HM is financially controlling and she has already stolen my car but I couldn’t do anything since it was under her name.

HM took that conversation badly and has been ignoring me since. She says I’m the one ignoring her but no matter the age, she is the adult and I’m the child. I think it’s her turn to respond to what I’ve said in a better way. She has done so much this past year from threatening to kick me out when I couldn’t afford it, having her BFF yell in my face and push me, stop helping me pay for college after she promised, didn’t tell me my dog died, withheld information from me, and talks badly of me to everyone we know. I can’t forget that. Yeah I know I should forgive for my own sake of healing, but I’m not forgiving the bullshit my HM has put me throughout my whole life making me live in a dump and then this past year making it the worst year for me. That’s not just something you can “move past.” I’m not gonna fight for a relationship with her because I’ve tried. And it’s not my place to apologize.

I hate the holidays only because I feel obligated to be around my dysfunctional family. They are starting to see how my HM really is, but they still ignore it. And that’s what hurts the most. They make me out to be the bad guy while knowing who the bad guy really is just to please the whole family. I feel more comfortable around my boyfriend’s family and honestly I may start making changes with hanging out with his family on holidays over mine.

If you’re struggling in the hoard or just feel lonely on your own this morning, I want to tell you to take a deep breath. Your environment doesn’t define you. This moment doesn’t define your future.

Growing up I always dreamed of the idea of being born 20 years earlier and ordering my dream spec individual e46 m3, obviously I was born way too late and wasn’t exactly born into any money. Dad worked for GM in the factory and we grew up in a lower income factory town so I never was able to grow up around cool cars so I found my love for cars in video games! Nonetheless, when I found out my wife was pregnant I decided it was time to make the dream a reality for myself, I was finally in a position to buy the car without taking out a loan and being an idiot so I let my wife spec a G80 for us as a cool thing to pass down to our son one day (and hopefully get my wife into cars finally). On paper I thought she was crazy but it turned out incredible! 8 month wait and the car showed up 3 weeks before my sons birth. I had all the current mods on it within 6 hours from delivery! The car pairs so well with my E46, luckily for me we recently had a nice clear in the cold weather in Ohio and was able to get out to a cars and coffee. Told the wife I was going and she asked if she could come, I was dumbfounded 😂 so she decided to drive the G80 with my son and I was able to bring the e46. (Last photo is us pulling into the c&c) One of the greatest moments in my life, I know that sounds funny but nobody in my family shares my car hobby considering the financial barrier so it is very fulfilling for myself to be able to have this moment with my son and wife ❤️ Hopefully one day soon I can buy my dad his dream car and fulfill his passion and have him tag along with us.

I’m on the lookout for a private room in a pre-occupied/shared flat. I’ll be working out of CV Raman Nagar, so I’m looking for something in Indiranagar (HAL 2nd/3rd Stage), Thippasandra, or GM Palya.

A bit about me:
I’m a non-vegetarian who loves a chill, relaxed vibe at home. I’m easy-going, respect privacy, but also don’t mind a weekend chat over some good food or a brew.

What I’m looking for:

• Budget: Max ₹20k (inclusive of maintenance if possible).
• Vibe: Chill and non-interfering. Non-veg friendly is a must.
• Preferences: A gated society would be amazing (for that extra peace of mind and basic amenities).
• Move-in: January end or Feb

If you have a lead or a room opening up in your flat, please hit me up! 
Happy to hop on a call or grab a coffee to see if the vibes match.

They packaged toxicity with it (SMV, looksmaxing, going for way younger women, pickup style gimmicks, prioritizing street approaches over social venues, deleting dating apps because “men can’t win on them”), but the core idea of going up to women irl is one that would benefit a lot of normal guys.

A lot of guys are afraid of perceived repercussions from approach from generalizing some TikToks and Reddit threads.  From personal experience though, I’ve never had any sort of tangible consequences from approaching something like 1000 women at places like bars, coffee shops, collaborative sections of libraries, parks, museums, grocery stores, and concerts).  In fact, I’ve gotten a fair amount of dates from it, and it’s built lots of social confidence and resilience in me.  It catalyzed my conversion from introvert to extrovert.

You don’t have to be a “chad” or “Adonis” or whatever they’re calling it now.  As a 29 year old, 5’8, obese, ginger man making well less than 6 figures and carrying well less than 6 inches, in just 2025 alone: 
- [] I met a very cute & fit girl at a concert and made out with her on the first date
- [ ] I went on an “instant date” at a museum with a very pretty girl 7 years my junior
- [ ] I got the number of a girl 7 years my senior at a library who I might still go out with (she was “flattered” by my approach and “commended” how I shot my shot, but just getting of a relationship)
- [ ] Made a close female friend who I play chess with a lot but wouldn’t date because she’s 20… has become like a little sister to me.
- [ ]  Flirted hard with this artsy lady in her early 40s at a social event where there was a lot of chemistry and mutual touch & exchanged numbers (not sure why this one didn’t go further tbh)
- [ ] Had a very long text exchange with this cute girl I met at Starbucks who in hindsight was never into me (still good practice)
- [ ] Made plans to get sushi with a girl I met at a park, though she didn’t follow through with them
- [ ] Made friends with a lesbian with great music taste in line at a music festival and still correspond with her online
- [ ] Got 3 girls instagrams in one day at a music festival (including one who had a huge following through her performance art) though for various reasons they didn’t go anywhere, including the one I had the best connection with inexplicably blocking me.
- [ ] Had a nice correspondence on IG with a girl I met at a concert who ended up having a BF
- [ ] Got the IG of a very cute girl waiting for my plane at the airport (didn’t go anywhere)
- [ ] Got the IG of a girl I saw at a couple of shows and recognized 
- [ ] A woman at a hotel bar actually approached me.  I fumbled because I was with co-workers
- [ ] Danced some with a girl at a night club even though those environments typically confuse me with their blurred lines of consent and my difficulty reading body language. 
- [ ] Had multiple women tell me they appreciated how bold I was
- [ ] Was never called a creep.  Never had security called on me.  Never saw my face plastered on social media as a creep.  Did have a girl laugh at me when I asked her out… but I took a quick walk and shook it off.  Worst reaction besides that was a girl saying she wasn’t in the mood to talk rn.

Still no relationship since my college GF in 2019, but I’ve gained a wealth of experience, self confidence and resilience that make me believe that’ll change soon.  I think a lot of you who are a little more fit and well put together than me could really transform your dating life with this.

That stat alone deserves a raised eyebrow.

First, the price. One hundred forty-six dollars and seventy-one cents gets you a no-name 2.4 GHz mouse with a single product photo and specs that read like a 2009 press release. For context, that same cash buys a Logitech MX Master 3S from a real store with spare change for coffee. The seller must be banking on the color red and the word “ergonomic” to justify the premium.

The feature list is charmingly retro. A 1,400 DPI sensor won’t win any esports trophies, the USB-A receiver sticks out like an antenna from 2012, and the side buttons flat-out refuse to work on macOS. Six million keystroke durability sounds impressive until you notice the fine print says “keystroke,” not “click,” so the number might be counting something else entirely.

Energy saving is handled by auto-sleep after seven minutes of inactivity. Two AAA batteries keep the party going, but the listing forgets to mention how long that actually lasts. No battery icon, no on-off switch, just hope and a screwdriver.

The ring-finger rest looks cozy in the single stock image, yet nobody has posted a real hand next to it. For all we know, the mouse is palm-sized for toddlers or shaped like a stealth bomber. One photo leaves a lot of imagination.

Compatibility claims are broad-Windows, macOS, Linux, even your cousin’s Raspberry Pi. Yet the side buttons play dead on Macs, which feels like selling a car with three wheels and calling it “mostly drivable.”

So when does this purchase make sense? Picture a corporate bulk order where the accounting code forbids brand names, the color red matches the company logo, and nobody cares about side buttons. Hand out twenty of these at the annual retreat and you’ve solved the “where’s my mouse?” problem for less than the price of one executive ergonomic chair.

In every other scenario, the math is brutal: you pay boutique money for bargain-bin tech. If you need a travel mouse that can survive a coffee spill, grab a $20 Logitech Pebble. If you crave flashy red, spray-paint a cheaper one. Twenty-four thousand buyers might be onto something, but it smells more like algorithmic virality than value.

My opinion: wonderful…as you all said in my first post, it's gorgeous. Creamy roses, like a milkshake, it lasts a long time (I tried it on my hand before showering and it still smelled great afterward).

1pvfhvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1pvfhvp/the_horizon_of_the_known/,The Horizon of the Known,"In cryptography, ""entropy"" is a commodity. We treat it like a natural resource we mine from the physical world. When a server generates a secure key, it looks for ""noise""—mouse movements, thermal fluctuations, radioactive decay—anything that looks unpredictable. The assumption is that if we can't predict it, neither can our adversaries.  


But there’s a sleight of hand happening here. We aren't actually using randomness. We’re using complexity that exceeds our ability to model it.  


If you had a computer powerful enough to track every variable in a thermal system, the ""noise"" wouldn’t be noise anymore. It would be data. The unpredictability isn't a feature of the system; it’s a confession of the observer's limitations. We call it ""entropy"" when we lose the thread of the story.  


This isn't just a quirk of computer security. It is the fundamental reality of the universe.

# The Blur

In physics, we have a law that feels like a death sentence: The Second Law of Thermodynamics. Entropy always increases. Things break, heat spreads out, order dissolves into chaos. We interpret this as the universe slowly wearing out, a clock winding down to zero.  


But look at the math, and a different picture emerges.

Ludwig Boltzmann, the father of statistical mechanics, defined entropy as a count. Specifically, it’s a count of how many different microscopic arrangements of atoms correspond to the same macroscopic description.  


Think of a cup of coffee. There are trillions of ways the individual water molecules can be arranged that still look like ""hot coffee"" to you. That’s high entropy. If the coffee is freezing into a complex ice crystal, there are far fewer ways for the molecules to be arranged while maintaining that specific crystal structure. That’s low entropy.

But notice the trick: ""Look like hot coffee to you.""  


Physicists call this *coarse-graining*. We don't see the individual atoms (the microstate); we see the bulk properties like temperature and pressure (the macrostate). Entropy is a measure of how much information is hidden in that blur.  


If you were a ""Laplacian Demon""—an observer capable of tracking every single particle with perfect precision—entropy wouldn't increase. The information is never destroyed; it just gets shuffled around. In a strictly deterministic universe, the ""fine-grained"" entropy stays constant.  


The ""increase"" in entropy—the Second Law itself—is what happens when you view a fine-grained reality through a coarse-grained lens. The universe isn't getting messier. It’s just moving toward configurations that are indistinguishable to us. It is evolving from states where the information is compressed and readable (low entropy) to states where the information is smeared out across correlations we can no longer track (high entropy).  


Entropy is the measure of our own blindness.

# The Cost of Forgetting

This sounds like philosophy, but the universe enforces it like a debt collector.  


In the 19th century, James Clerk Maxwell imagined a demon guarding a gate between two chambers of gas. By letting fast molecules into one side and slow ones into the other, the demon could create a temperature difference without doing work, apparently breaking the Second Law.  


It took a century to figure out why the demon fails. The answer is Rolf Landauer’s principle: *Information is physical.*  


To sort the molecules, the demon has to measure them. It has to store that information in a memory. Eventually, that memory fills up. To keep working, the demon has to erase old data to make room for new measurements.  


And here is the physical law: logical irreversibility implies thermodynamic irreversibility. You cannot erase a bit of information without releasing heat. The minimum cost is $kT \\ln 2$ joules per bit.  


The demon doesn't heat up the universe by thinking; it heats up the universe by *forgetting*.  


This bridges the gap between physics and information theory. They aren't just analogous; they are the same mechanic. The universe charges an energy tax on any system that wants to maintain a model of the world but has limited memory.

# The Resistance

This brings us to life.  


In a universe where correlations tend to smear out, life is a weird anomaly. It is a pocket of persistence. Biology seems to fight the Second Law, building complex, ordered structures out of chaotic raw materials.  


But life isn't violating thermodynamics; it’s hacking it. Living things are *dissipative structures*. We maintain our low internal entropy by aggressively exporting high entropy to our surroundings. We eat ordered energy (food, sunlight) and excrete disordered energy (heat, waste). We are whirlpools in the thermodynamic river—structures that exist *because* they are efficient at dissipating energy.

To do this effectively, you need more than just metabolism. You need prediction.  


A rock gets heated by the sun and cools at night. It reacts. A bacterium, however, can detect a sugar gradient and swim toward it. It implies a primitive ""if/then"" logic. It is modeling the future.

Scale this up to a nervous system, and you get a prediction engine. A brain is a calorie-expensive machine that pays for itself by building a coarse-grained model of the environment. By predicting where food will be, or where a predator will strike, the organism can navigate the chaos. It maintains its own internal order by getting better at processing the external disorder.  


Consciousness, in this frame, isn't some ghostly additive. It is *modeling depth*. It is what happens when the prediction engine becomes powerful enough to include itself in the simulation.

# The Strange Loop

This is the pivot point. When a system models the world, it creates a map. When the system is complex enough to recognize itself as an agent within that world, the map has to include a mark for ""You Are Here.""  


This recursion—the modeler modeling itself modeling the world—creates a perspective. An ""inside.""  


We experience the flow of time, the uncertainty of the future, and the solidity of the past. But these are artifacts of our modeling architecture.  


* **The Past:** The data we have already processed and compressed (low entropy).
* **The Future:** The data that hasn't arrived yet (high entropy).
* **The Present:** The horizon where the processing happens.

To us, the future looks random. We see ""entropy increasing."" But that’s because we are embedded in the system, viewing it through a keyhole. We mistake the limits of our resolution for the nature of reality.

# The View from the Inside

So, does the universe have a direction? Is it really winding down?

From the ""fine-grained"" perspective of fundamental physics, no. The quantum state evolves unitarily. Information is conserved. The movie is already on the reel.  


But from the ""coarse-grained"" perspective of an observer—us—the winding down is real. It is the price of having a perspective at all. To exist as a distinct entity, you must be separate from your environment. To be separate is to have incomplete information. To have incomplete information is to experience entropy.  


We are not passive observers watching the universe fade. We are the universe’s way of organizing itself into pockets of high-resolution modeling. We are the mechanism by which the cosmos looks at itself.  


The ""noise"" we see in the data, the ""randomness"" we harvest for encryption, the ""decay"" we fear in the stars—it’s all just the difference between what is, and what we can grasp.

Once upon a time, I was an “important business man”. My goal was to have my importance validated as a diamond (cough cough drinking”ambassador”).

I was traveling for work constantly, for a job I didn’t like. But hey, each night got me closer to a faceless corporation recognizing what a BFD i am. On my journey to my ultimate status, they referred to me as various elements, each tier more valuable. Plus! I got a free bottle of water for my efforts (excessive spending). I was a BFD….they don’t give out bottles of Poland springs water to just anyone!

I was effing miserable. Drinking myself into a stupor every night. Nursing hangovers with terrible hotel room coffee because I was too sick to make it down to the lobby. Constant panic attacks, bloating, sweats, and terrible BMs.

But hey, despite the sterile, depersonalized hotel room, I was on my way to becoming the elite of the elite! I was succeeding at life! I had a fancy loyalty status to prove it.

I finally gave up. I couldn’t keep playing. Physically, mentally, emotionally, I was exhausted. 

I put down the beer. I quit the job. I spent more time at home with my family. I lost weight. I gained confidence. I gained control over my emotions. I started to live again!

I’ve never been so happy. I traded being a BFD to a faceless Corp for being a loving husband.

Last night, I stayed at a courtyard for the first time in years. Memories flowed back. The intense, all-encompassing loneliness. The terrible pillows, scratchy towels, and dehumanized environment brought back memories. Memories I’m glad I have because they teach me what is important in life. 

I don’t need validation from an ego-boosting scheme masquerading as a loyalty Program. I don’t need to have strangers realize how successful I am, how important I am.

I need human connection. I need time at home with my family -with people who know me, who love me, whom I enjoy spending time with.

But hey, two free bottles of water is a pretty big deal too…just not for me anymore.

I’ve been using my Cafelat Robot for about two weeks and I’m really enjoying it, but I’m still struggling to get past mediocre results despite studying and experimenting quite a bit.

Current setup for this shot:
- 18 g Brazilian pulped natural (Bahia)
- 36 g yield
- 100 °C water
- Basket and piston preheated
- Paper filter sandwich (top + bottom)
- 10s pre infusion 
- Timemore C3 ESP Pro at 0.7 clicks (tested from 0.7–0.8)

This particular shot was very acidic, while others — with small tweaks — tend to swing to noticeable bitterness.

Some extra context: I don’t have another Robot reference for this coffee, but friends are pulling great shots with the same beans on a Flair Pro 2 (I’ve tasted one, and it was excellent).

If anyone has advice, suggestions, or resources that could help me improve my results on the Robot, I’d really appreciate it.

Start with ""Let's think about this differently"". It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use ""What am I not seeing here?"". This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say ""Break this down for me"". Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

Just moved into my own place in NYC (26M) and want to make it a spot that feels great for me but also for friends and guests. Please disregard the mess... I had to move things around to paint the place.

I’m posting pics of the whole apartment, but here’s what I’m planning so far:

**Bedroom (136” x 118”, about 87” to the door):**

* Queen bed on the 136” wall with two small nightstands (<20” each)
* Dresser on the side closer to the window
* Desk against the window (where the gray rectangle is)
* Full-length mirror leaning to the right of the closet
* Thinking about a pendant light since there’s no ceiling fixture — open to other lighting ideas
* The plants in the photos were the previous tenant’s, might be too far gone. Open to adding some greenery though

**Living Room:**

* \~85” right-facing sectional on the back-left 87” wall
* Possibly an accent chair or bench opposite the chaise
* Small coffee table in the middle
* 75” TV (about 65” wide) on a 75–80” media console
* If I end up with a smaller couch (\~80”), I’ll add a narrow end table
* Planning to get a rug too

**Kitchen / Entry area:**

* Not much flexibility with the fridge and island, but open to thoughts on orientation
* Should I add barstools or will that make it feel cramped?
* Across from the fridge/island:
   * A bar cart near the front closet
   * A drop-leaf dining table further down the wall so I can host dinners when needed

Trying to keep it clean and minimal but still warm and inviting; any suggestions for layout, lighting, or little touches that make the space feel more put together?

And to my sponsor, he was the final push for me to leave. He would only have long speaches about himself and we’d never get to the steps on any of our meet-ups. And he started his own online meeting where he and his ex sponsor, whom just got back from a long crack fueled relapse btw, were taking turns on how they see the program, and how’d they could write a better new book. Nobody were aloud to share. Just ask the experts questions afterwards…

Well, he texts me alot to grab coffee. And I really don’t feel like it. I’m pretty sure that he just wants to know if I am drinking or not. Maybe confirm that my life has fallen apart (it has NOT). But maybe I am wrong.

I am a 31 year old man, originally from Southern Kerala. I work in tech as a Devops engineer in Bangalore. I'm looking for someone based in Bangalore or planning to. be, with whom I can be friends as well as turn it to a life-long relationship. I want to be child free because I think the world as it is now is going to be difficult for a new life to grow and survive, which is already overpopulated, and don’t want to devote the rest of my life’s time and energy in that, which is a big task indeed. I would rather love to live life freely with someone and travel around the world.



A little about me:

I'm 176 cm, 75kg, active with workouts for the past 1.5 years, continuing dedicatedly on the transformation i wanted to make and progressing well. I play badminton. 

I love football, traveling and also trying my hand with cooking and started reading books recently. I'm a non-vegetarian. I love pets, and have 2 dogs in my hometown and love cats too.



What am I looking for:

My type of woman is someone who is emotionally intelligent, honest, understanding, empathetic and can communicate well. Someone who is okay with silences in conversations at times and not in a rush to be in a relationship . We don’t need to be in a pressure cooker situation to prove ourselves to be someone we are not. Let’s embrace our natural and real selves.


Prefer someone who is working, and can manage their own expenses. It doesn't mean you won't receive the occasional surprises but I want to ensure that you are someone who is financially stable enough to survive on your own. Also I prefer someone who is into fitness, if not already, then plan to be. We could be workout partners and hype each other up and grow together :) 


We could go out together, try out different variety of food, taste coffee, watch movies, travel to different places, and try out new things and experiences. 


I could say a lot of fancy things to attract you, but I would rather not do that and over commit giving you false hope. I would rather build a relationship with a strong foundation based on understanding and the person who you are. Loyalty and trust is important to me. ",2,1766675187.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

On this date in 1980, the [Hands of the Cause of God residing in the Holy Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custodians) addressed a letter to the [Hands of the Cause of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands_of_the_Cause) throughout the world, later published in the May 1980 Bahá’í News, giving an account of the murder of [Enoch Olinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch_Olinga) on September 16, 1979.



Declared a Knight of Bahá’u’lláh for his pioneering work in the British Cameroons, Shoghi Effendi entitled Olinga ""Abd'l-Futuh"", an Arabic name meaning ""the father of victories,"" for the successive waves of people becoming Knights of Bahá’u’lláh in Africa after him.  A close associate of Ugandan President [Idi Amin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_Amin),  who was deposed and exiled on April 11, 1979, Enoch Olinga, his wife, and three of his five children were murdered by unknown gunmen on September 16, 1979, during the administration of President [Milton Obote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Obote) when people affiliated with the Amin regime were being systematically targeted.  [Denis MacEoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_MacEoin) touches on this topic in his 1979 *[Letter on Bahá'í attitudes towards politics and scholarship.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnThisDateInBahai/comments/7p9ubo/january_7_on_this_date_in_1979_denis_maceoin/)*





[A Sacrifice to Fidelity: The senseless, brutal slayings of Enoch Olinga, his wife and children](https://bahai-library.com/sacrifice_fidelity), published in *Bahá'í News*, 590, pages 2-6, May 1980.

>In all of these sad events it is some consolation to know that apparently the murder of Mr. Olinga was in no way directly connected with either religion or politics; in other words no one associated Enoch with any political factions and this attack on him was not in the nature of an attack on the Faith itself. Enoch may have been killed just because he was an affluent businessman and well known because of this and as a ""leader"" of the Bahá'ís. For some years past in Uganda the elimination of prominent people has been a fixed policy of certain factions and nearly all those who fell into this category fled the country. Mr. Vuyiya, who arrived in Kampala from Nairobi three days after the event, writes, ""... staying in the middle of the town, I had the full effect of the state of near anarchy in Kampala at night. There were shots every night."" He points out that in the nightly curfew no one could tell who was roaming about the streets and that every night brought with it ""... the news of the murder of yet another family."" As nothing worth mentioning, including a large sum of money which was available in Mr. Olinga's desk, seems to have been stolen from the home, some people consider that it was one of the acts being regularly committed by some obscure faction, to create the impression that lawlessness was rampant and thus discredit the efforts of the new Government to maintain law and order. In similar killings these ""thugs"" have stated they are not thieves but have come ""only for lives.""


>Now that detailed reports have been received here, we feel we should acquaint you fully with these matters so that the Bahá'ís, through this' report to you, will be properly informed and not attribute his murder to all kinds of things which have no foundation in fact; we notice through meetings with the friends and letters received here that there is a lot of speculation, misinformation and personal interpretation of events going about. Hence the details contained in this letter, most of which you already know.



>There is no doubt that the fidelity of Enoch to the Bahá'í community and its interests in Uganda, and in particular to the Mother Temple for Africa, was not only outstanding and most touching but, on more than one occasion the respect in which he was held by many prominent non-Bahá'ís enabled him to safeguard the House of Worship and the adjacent National Headquarters, at a time when meetings were forbidden and the country itself in a very dangerous condition. For almost two years (due to the banning of the Faith in Uganda along with twenty-six other religious organizations in September 1977) Enoch and the two Ugandan members of the Continental Board of Counsellors for Central and East Africa, Oloro Epyeru and Kolonario Oule, had been made responsible, by the Universal House of Justice, for the protection and guidance of the Faith there. At last conditions had begun to change and our Supreme Body was able to appoint a Uganda Administrative Committee to take over the administrative work, pending such time as the re-election of the National Spiritual Assembly could be held. This important new Committee held its first meeting in the National Haziratu'I-Quds on the Bahá'í Temple property on August 25, 1979. Enoch was present and invited to chair it. He was radiantly happy and distributed to the Committee members present ""a well worked out and soul stirring devotional programme,"" handing each one a new prayer book with passages marked. They all went to the Temple for this most moving devotional inauguration of their work and from there visited the grave of the Hand of the Cause of God Musa Banani and after praying there returned to the National Centre to start their meeting, which they opened with the Tablet of Ahmad. Enoch then presented each one with one of the prayer books as a gift and he and the others all signed each book — truly a precious memento of an historic occasion which constituted the ""resurrection"" of the Ugandan Bahá'í community.



>According to the minutes of that meeting: ""the beloved Hand of the Cause of God presented the appointment letter from the Universal House of Justice to the Committee. He observed that this Committee was an arm of the Universal House of Justice stretched over Uganda"" and assured them this appointment conferred the capacity and worthiness to do their work and therefore they should rely on the power of the Holy Spirit at all times. The Committee then decided to draft a cable to the Universal House of Justice signifying their acceptance of their appointment and desire to serve worthily. This entire meeting was a ""joy-laden"" occasion and ended with singing Bahá'í songs.



>The following day Enoch again acted as Chairman at the second meeting and set before its members a clear picture of the needs of both the Faith throughout the country and the many things requiring to be done at the Temple property owing to the depredations caused by the conditions inside Uganda and the war — telephone connection, water supply, office equipment, lawn mowers were all gone; the Universal House of Justice had provided a budget for restoring the property and the National Centre to a condition where it could be kept up and the administrative work function; the property also urgently needed personnel to stay on Kikaaya Hill and protect it. Many duties were outlined and discussed and a plan made to hold a National Briefing Conference during October. This was later called the ""Re-Birth Conference.""



>The next meeting of this Committee took place on September 15th — the day before Enoch's murder. He was not present but the Counsellor Kolonario Oule had specially come to Kampala to meet with it and discuss the work in his area. His arrival at this moment, when the black cloud of catastrophe was already drawing near, was truly providential. As both Ugandan Counsellors — Kolonario Oule and Oloro Epyeru — live about 300 kilometers north-east of Kampala, communication and travel were not easy and Oule apologized for both his and Epyeru's absence, due to illness, from the first meeting. He paid glowing tribute to not only Enoch's services but his ""matchless courage"" during the most difficult period the Cause had passed through.



>We learn from George Olinga, Enoch's eldest son, that from the time the Faith was banned until Idi Amin fell from power his father, on many occasions, stated he would not leave the country or run away. He was not only worried over the morale of the Bahá'ís but was very much concerned about the Bahá'í properties and their protection. That they were safeguarded in the midst of so much turmoil, that precious archive material was removed to a remote spot and nothing happened to it, we owe largely to this fellow Hand of ours, this Enoch we loved so much.



>In April 1979 Enoch was injured and very narrowly escaped death in a serious car accident, the cause of which was suspicious; he told George he considered it providential as otherwise he would have gone to his home in Teso and he had learned later that his name was on a list for ""liquidation"" there. As he was recovering from this accident and living up at the Temple site during the chaotic period of looting in Kampala, his presence there was undoubtedly the reason the Bahá'í properties — particularly the precious Mother Temple of Africa — were not also looted. Generally speaking the looters passed over places which were occupied, especially if a strong personality stood up to them. During this period, however, Enoch's own home was looted completely bare. He went down one day from Kikaaya Hill to his house and found this going on; for some moments his own life was in acute danger as he was accused at gun point of being a soldier of Amin; when he succeeded in convincing them he was not, his life was spared. He and his family, who for safety's sake he had sent to their home in Teso, then had to set about the complete restoration and refurnishing of their house.



>Shortly before the conquest of Kampala had taken place, which preceded the above incident, Enoch's son Badi was hijacked with his pickup by Amin's soldiers and disappeared for over a week. The anguish of worry over his whereabouts and fear for his life was acute and George states that in his father's many prayers he asked Bahá’u’lláh to accept Badi as a sacrifice for His Cause. When Badi was finally released by Amin's soldiers, who had impounded his car for transportation, the relief of the Olinga family was great, but it had been a terrible experience for his young sister Tahirih who suffered severe depression as a result. Indeed, it was partly to cheer her up that the large family reunion was planned for Sunday, September 16th, which was her birthday.



>Of his father's last days George writes: ""He spent most of his time at Kikaaya cutting the grass around the Temple, sweeping the Temple, and the last few days before his tragic death he had reorganized the Bahá’í Centre, from washing the floor to allocation of rooms for various functions of the newly appointed Administrative Committee. During their first meeting in Kampala I had just arrived from Nairobi and Daddy was overjoyed when I told them that while I was in Kenya I had found the grass mowers for the Temple grounds and that they had been purchased . . . So happy was Daddy during these last days of his life that he told some of the friends he is so relieved to have handed over to the Administrative Committee that he was ready to die.""



>Even on that fate-laden Sunday, September 16th, Enoch and his wife and the children who were in Kampala had been up at the Temple, as George states that on that day his father ""was in a happy mood and spent most of the time in Kikaaya.""



>As the regular nightly curfew began at 8 p.m. we assume well before that hour the Olingas returned to their home — the former historic home of the Hand of the Cause Musa Banani, which Enoch had bought when Mrs. Banani could no longer live there alone because of the steady increase of robbery and violence inside Kampala, in spite of the fact that the house was in a very good residential district inside the city; Enoch had added to the property a high barbed wire fence and a gate to ensure greater protection.



>It is probably never going to be possible to establish exactly what the terrible course of events was which took place that night; sleeping next to the garage, in a building near the back door, which gave on to the small compound into which, through the gate, the automobile driveway entered the grounds, was a Bahá’í garden boy; on either side of the Olinga property were neighbors. In a city where murder for many weeks has stalked the streets in the dark, and the rattle of automatic fire is frequently heard, people keep inside and under cover themselves when they hear guns going off nearby. No doubt this was equally true of those near the Olinga home.



>We are told, however, by the garden boy, that Elizabeth was in the kitchen, at the back of the house preparing dinner with Lennie; Badi was studying in a back bedroom at the end of the inner corridor and Tahirih may have been with him. It is conjectured that there were six armed men, one remained to guard the gate through which they broke into the property, and the other five came to the back door demanding it be opened and firing shots. Whatever exactly took place a trail of blood was found from the kitchen to the room Badi was in and a rough attempt had been made to bandage Lennie's leg where he had been wounded. As this is the room where all except Enoch were murdered, it seems likely they sought refuge there, locked the door and enough time elapsed to try and staunch Lennie's wound before the armed men broke in and evidently lined Elizabeth, Lennie, Badi and Tahirih up against the wall and shot them; two rows of bullet holes showed they were shot both at chest and knee level and the pitiful mangled remains of these four people were found next day on the floor in a pile. Exactly what happened to Enoch is not known; George surmises, from accounts of those who were at least in the vicinity, if not actual eyewitnesses of what took place in the house, that Enoch was in the sitting room, heard the cries and shots, came out into the compound at the back and was taken in either to see his family shot or see them lying dead and once again came out into the compound for he was heard to be weeping and sobbing out loud; he was then shot from behind in the chest and hips and fell in front of the garage. The neighbors stated that they phoned the police five times when all this was happening but were told there were patrol cars in the area; no one came. In the morning, whenever he dared to venture forth, the garden boy found Enoch's body and ran to inform a member of the newly appointed Uganda Administrative Committee who immediately went to the home of ""Auntie Claire,"" the much-loved and esteemed early pioneer to Africa who owns a well-known nursery school. During all the warfare and troubles in Uganda and in Kampala, Claire Gung, in spite of her 79 years and very poor health, had remained at her post. Now, at the time of this grievous crisis, despite her own shock and heartbreak, she placed many phone calls, trying to contact George in Kenya and let him know what had happened, seeking to inform the World Centre and receive guidance from the Universal House of Justice, telephoning as far afield as England in case other channels should not prove effective. The solicitude of the Universal House of Justice for Miss Gung's welfare — in the midst of all its own shock, grief and pressing duties at that time — was most touching and was reflected in the constant communications from Haifa regarding the funeral and other matters in which messages of appreciation, assurance of prayers and admonitions to take care of her health were included.



>It will be remembered that Sunday, the 16th of September, was to have been a family reunion for all the Olinga children in East Africa; George, his wife and two children were coming back from a visit to a Bahá'í on the coast of Kenya; Patrick was due back in Kampala from a trip to Teso to sell coffee for his father; Godwin, who was in Fort Portal, decided to wait until George arrived and then come in to Kampala. By such tenuous threads are the lives of people suspended! George was delayed because he could not get the right' tires for his car, Patrick decided to wait until Monday and see how much the coffee was sold for, Godwin just waited . . .



>At length the frantic telephone calls of Claire Gung succeeded in conveying the terrible news to both the Continental Board of Counsellors' Office in Nairobi and the Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of Kenya. The Counsellor, Peter Vuyiya, was fortunately in Nairobi, staying at the National Center, and was able to telephone the Universal House of Justice, which was in session when this terrible news was broken to it. From then on the guidance of the House was with the heartbroken friends and family responsible for making all decisions for the funeral, for the burial, for publicity and so on. On that same day, Monday the 17th, George and his wife and children left for Kampala, spending a night en route at Kisumu. Peter Vuyiya decided to not get involved with air travel and left early the 18th, arriving, by a process of many changes from one communal taxi to another, in Kampala before curfew fell.



>While all these events were taking place Enoch and his family were still lying Monday morning where their murderers had left them. Two of the devoted African Bahá'ís had immediately gone to the Olinga home and were there when the police made their investigations.



>In reading over a great many pages of reports one is deeply impressed by the fact that the people on the spot, the victims of civil war, terrorism, looting, constant crimes and dangers, acted with astonishing presence of mind, courage and capability. Their calmness, faith and fortitude shine through the horrible tale of violent death and all its degrading details. We all acutely realize the loss of Enoch and the wanton murder of his wife and children. What we do not perhaps appreciate is the defenseless state of the dead in a city devoid of facilities, still mostly without any law enforcement, in hot weather, in a country depleted of almost every commodity. Yet the three Counsellors, Oloro Epyeru, Kolonario Oule, and Peter Vuyiya, with the members of the very recently appointed Administrative Committee, together with members of Enoch's family and a handful of friends, lifted — like veritable giants — the manifold burdens of this unheard-of situation and carried their work forward to a beautiful and dignified conclusion when the bodies were finally interred on Tuesday, September 25th, in the Bahá'í cemetery.

What do I do now?,"I have a golden retriever who is a very, very good dog with no history of aggression at all. I’ve never even heard her growl before. She normally sits on the couch next to me while I have my coffee, but today was different because my 12-year-old son wanted to sit on the couch next to me after opening his Christmas presents.

He said, “get off the couch” to her, which normally works as a command to get her off the couch. Then he reached to physically nudge her off the couch and she responded with a quick growl and a snap (quicker than I could have intervened). She made contact with his skin with her front teeth but didn’t injure him at all. 

I immediately jumped up (and spilled my coffee everywhere 😅) and grabbed her by the collar and physically pulled her away from my son and onto the floor. That part happened in a split second before I had time to think about whether it was correct, it was just an instinct.

I firmly told her to lie down on the other side of the room and made her stay there for about half an hour. She looked upset and was licking the air but she stayed in her down-stay. I gave her treats for staying and then invited her to sit with me on the couch later.

What I’m needing help with is figuring out how normal this is. I know there are some people who think that ANY aggression, even a growl and even without injury, is a very big deal but I also know that she gave a warning and didn’t actually hurt my son. 

I’m worried I made it worse by kicking her off the couch, like maybe that was perceived as punishment and now she won’t give a warning in the future when resource guarding.

I've been gathering some quotes about Phyre's background to study the possible implications of their life throughout the centuries. 

It will take me a while as I go through the dialogue files and The Art of Bloodlines 2. Feel free to reach out with questions, add your own thoughts or challenge my notes anytime, there's still a long way to go before I can finalise a decent timeline.

In this analysis, we will consider the First Night to be the start of the actual story, i.e., Phyre's awakening from torpor.

Feel free to use this timeline for other analyses, fanfiction, etc. And Merry Christmas to everyone!

\---

# Context

It's was a little difficult to figure out how much time passed between Phyre waking up in the basement and their frenzy killing spree. There's a few clues here and there, but it's in fact Lou Graham that gives us one of the first indications of how to sketch out a proper timeline during her first meeting with Phyre:

>**Lou**: *“Two nights ago, my poor childe was found outside of Weaver Tower missing something rather vital: his head.”*   
**Phyre**: *“There was a killing spree last night?”*   
**Lou**: *“A figure in a bloodied white gown, so I hear. Running rabid through the streets, trailing gore and Dior knows what else (...) Oh, the wayward childe's all over their ""television news and social media"". Mortals call them ""Hashtag Vampire Bundy. Nobody's taking it seriously, of course.""*

This means that Phyre is on their third night after waking up from torpor. We don't know the exact date, but we do know that the story happens during Christmas time in Seattle, 2024.

I've attempted to make a timeline for the first 3 nights, to set myself with some context:

# First night

* In an attempt to get some leverage with the Camarilla court, Katsumi tips off Campbell that the Anarchs intercepted a weapons shipment to a Seattle warehouse*\[(and, subsequently, kidnap Safia's ghouls while they were moving Phyre into the underground)\]*.

>(*...) For whatever reason, a pact existed between Prince Campbell and Katsumi, a respected figure in the Anarchs (...)*   
*— The Art of Bloodlines 2, p.79*

* Campbell goes check the warehouse.
* Fabien arrives at the warehouse, intent on recording Campbell's confession that he and Lou were responsible for the original Rebar killings. When the plan fails, Fabien sacrifices himself and gets revenge for Gideon by waking up the Elder in torpor, who will kill everyone in the vicinity. Fabien gets diablerised.
* Campbell is killed by Phyre, his head severed from his body.
* Campbell's body is dropped near Weaver Tower by either the Anarchs or Safia's Sabbat.
* Phyre starts a frenzy rampage kill, suffering from intense hunger after having been in torpor for 100 years.

Extra:

>**Bet of Night (ep.2):** *""Before you open yourself up to me Seattle, I do have some tragic news: J.J. Campbell, head of DotGEO Futures has unexpectedly passed away.""*   
**Bet of Night (ep.2):** *""J.J. was a noted entrepreneur who did a lot of good for the city, or so I hear. Rest in peace, Mr. Campbell, Seattle will miss you.""*

Episode 2 of Bet of Night (fourth, fifth night?) has a brief update about Campbell, former Prince of the Camarilla, entrepreneur extraordinaire. Which is supremely ironic, given that official sources tell us the following:

>*(...) Campbell started out as a mobster in the 1920's.*   
*— The Art of Bloodlines 2, p.94*

# Second night

>*A Kindred stirs in an abandoned apartment, deep in an unfamiliar suburb of an unknown city. They've been unconscious for a century — and now, suddenly, they're awake. Disoriented. Alone. Hungry. Before they can uncover who put them here, or why, they must feed.*   
*— The Art of Bloodlines 2, p.75*

***Note****: As far as we've seen in-game, Phyre feeds from exactly 2 people during frenzy: Fabien and Richie, the guard. I wonder whether they killed or drained others, though perhaps not necessarily — as they might've regained control of their actions sooner.*

* Phyre's frenzy continues, as they're still unable to control the Beast.
* Eventually, Phyre wakes up, having fed enough to get their Hunger sated and the Beast under control *\[(this translates to the vampire achieving Hunger 1 or 0, according to vtm rules, which pacifies the Beast)\]*.
* Fabien's conscience (essence? soul?) awakens in Phyre.
* We know it’s around 2AM:

>**Radio host:** *""Hello Seattle, this is your 2AM weather and traffic update. We're still under a severe storm warning and it's cold, cold, cold out there.""*

* Fabien leads Phyre to a makeshift haven.

# Third night

>*The Nomad wakes up in a makeshift haven—an apartment Fabien leads them to, somehow knowing that the previous owner doesn't need it anymore. From there, the two begin to piece their situation together. Questions stack up. Why is Phyre covered with markings, and who marked them? How come Fabien appears to be stuck in Phyre's head?*   
*— The Art of Bloodlines 2, p.85*

During the third night, Phyre meets several power players from Seattle's Camarilla court and begins their investigation into the marks. I was most interested in obtaining an overview of each possible background at this stage, and understand what lies beneath Phyre's caution, as they're more cautious with words than usual at this stage.

>**Fabien**: *""Some have you as a destroyer, others an omen of doom. But er...what would you say?""*

There's 3 possible backgrounds: survivor, traveler and warrior. I've yet to deepen which options belong to each category, but there's some digging to be done and conclusions to be drawn from this start alone.

\---

In the following dialogue, it seems that the base background picked by the player for Phyre always ties in with a comment from Safia in the final boss fight.

I've also noticed that Safia's taunts might actually hold a glimmer of truth. That being said, I wonder whether these conjectures she makes about The Nomad were based in books or from a warped view fed to her by the Sabbat.

Phyre cuts off Fabien when it gets too personal. This happens in every background, and eventually we figure out that most of their misadventures are related to the Sabbat, somehow.

# ""I am a survivor.""

>Phyre: *""Where I travel, disaster follows. When I war, it is against misfortune. If I am anything, I am a survivor.""*   
Fabien: *""Oh. That's not what I expected to hear. But if that's the truth, that's the truth. And I'm rather fond of surviving, myself.""*   
Fabien: *""Well then. What's the most dangerous thing out there, in your experience?""*  
  
  
\[mid/endgame\]  
*(...)* Safia: *""So you escaped. And you've been running ever since.""* *(...)*   
(...) Safia: *""You are no mere survivor. You are the plague rat, the harbinger of wretched misery.""*

**01: Mortals that hate**

>Phyre: *""I saw the Witch Trials as they played out across Europe. They slew many of our kind - I barely escaped.""*   
Phyre: *""But in fear and hate, they also slaughtered the ones they loved.""*   
Phyre: *""Mortal hate is the danger. And there are forces who harness it. If they could burn the whole world, they would.""*   
Fabien: *""Bad news. In 1945 they figured out how to, uh... Never mind. Good news: Despite it all, we're still here.""*   
Fabien: *""You'll forgive me for asking, I hope, but I can't help but wonder... How did you fall into mortal hands?""*   
Fabien: *""It just doesn't seem your style. Something more happened. Didn't it?""*   
Phyre: *""I have said all I desire to say about myself.""*

**02: Ideals that demand blood**

>Phyre: *""I was in France during the Reign of Terror. At first, I admired their work. They killed every enemy of the people.""*   
Phyre: *""And then, they did something remarkable: They made more enemies of the people. And more.""*   
Phyre: *""Ideals that demand blood are never satiated. They are the danger. Many I knew died their final deaths. I nearly died mine.""*   
Fabien: *""Were you on the original list? Or the expanded edition?""*   
Phyre: *“I am on the list of those who survived, and that is all that matters.""*   
Fabien: *""You'll forgive me for asking, I hope, but I can't help but wonder... How did you fall into mortal hands?""*   
Fabien: *""It just doesn't seem your style. Something more happened. Didn't it?""*   
Phyre: *""I have said all I desire to say about myself.""*  


>\[mid/endgame\]  
*(...)* Safia: *""Your escape from Paris, from Moscow! You seem the very herald of devastation. Not in a bad way - I mean...""* *(...)*   
Safia: *""The Black Hand locked you behind iron doors under Paris, and you only escaped the blade by crawling through sewage.""*02: Ideals that demand blood

**03: The fight for power**

>Phyre: *""I have escaped wars over the mortal crowns of Spain, England, Poland, Austria.""*   
Phyre: *""So too have I escaped purges, plots, and persecutions in the Courts of our kind.""*   
Phyre: *""Whether mortal or not, it is the same. When it is uncertain who holds power, knives come out.""*   
Fabien: *""Interesting times, for certain... have you ever lived in an uninteresting time?""*   
Phyre: *""No. There are always those who sow confusion and sharpen knives. We do what we must.""*   
Fabien: *""Well, Seattle has both confusion and knives aplenty. But you weren't just running - you helped out, right?""*   
Phyre: *""I have said all I desire to say about myself.""*  


>\[endgame\]  
*(...)* Safia: *""For fear of the Black Hand, you saw knives in every shadow. Every time a hand was held out to you, you bit it, and fled for fear of chains.""*03: The fight for power

\---

# ""I am a traveler.""

>Phyre: *""I have journeyed across centuries and continents. I am a traveler.""*   
Fabien: *""The stories sure do have you on the move.”*   
Phyre: *""Stagnation is corruption.""*   
Fabien: *“""Amen. If you don't mind me asking, was there anywhere, anywhen, that just clicked for you?""*

>  
\[mid/endgame\]  
*(...)* Safia: *""So you left. And you never looked back.""*   
*(...)* Safia: ""*You are no mere traveler. You are cowardice in the form of a Cainite.""*

**01: Buying dreams in Constantinople**

>Phyre: *""Constantinople. Four hundred years ago. My mortal home. My home afterward, too, for a time.""*   
Phyre: *""My favorite place was the Grand Bazaar. The colors, the vitality. Air heavy with perfume and spice from lands that I then only dreamed of.""*   
Fabien: *""I'm no wanderer, but the world's a lot smaller now than it was. Getting smaller, too. How big it must have been, back then...""*   
Phyre: *“Not big enough.”*   
Fabien: *""You'll forgive me for asking, but... there's more to the story. Something else - someone else - happened, right?""*   
Phyre: *""I have said all I desire to say about myself.""*  


>\[endgame\]  
*(...)* Safia: *""The shadow of the Black Hand drove you from the New Rome.""*

**02: The Masquerades of Venice**

>Phyre: *""I used to roam the calli of Venice, La Serenissima, late at night.""*   
Phyre: *""We all wore masks then everything was an intrigue, a romance. We played such beautiful, deadly games.""*   
Fabien: *""Sounds a little too sophisticated for me, and a little too stabby. I favor a simple city of thugs and coffee.""*   
Phyre: *""It was amusing. Until it wasn't. But there we are.""*   
Fabien: *""You'll forgive me for asking, but... there's more to the story. Something else - someone else - happened, right?""*   
Phyre: *""I have said all I desire to say about myself.""*  


>\[endgame\]  
*(...)* Safia: *""The shadow of the Black Hand stalked you through Venice.""*

**03: The libraries of Prague**

>Phyre: *""I remember Prague, with its hundred spires. And its libraries. Places of terror and delight.""*   
Phyre: *""I read ancient books that were printed when I was young. And I read many secrets. Invaluable and unutterable.""*   
Fabien: *""A reader, huh? I like a good mystery myself. Tangled webs that work to a simple solution. What real life should be like but so rarely is.""*   
Phyre: *Ah. Fiction. Most of the two thousand books I read claimed to be fact. Very few told the truth.""*   
Fabien: *""You'll forgive me for asking, but... there's more to the story. Something else - someone else - happened, right?""*   
Phyre: *""I have said all I desire to say about myself.""*  


>\[endgame\]  
*(...)* Safia: *""You fled through the streets of Prague from the Black Hand.""*

\---

# ""I am a warrior.""

>Phyre: *“I am a warrior.""*   
Fabien: *“""Well, your reputation holds up. My own philosophy is: when they throw a punch, be somewhere else. Preferably a different city.""*   
Fabien: *""But while we're killing time, did you have a favorite time killing?""*  


>\[mid/endgame\]  
*(...)* Safia: *""You must have fought your way out. You've been fighting ever since.""*   
*(...)* Safia: *""You are no true warrior. You are an opportunist, a dilettante, a coward.""*  


**01: Spoiling Napoleon’s ambitions**

>Phyre: *""I aided Cadiz, when Napoleon invaded after his exile.""*   
Phyre: *""It was the only city that never fell to him. I spoiled the ambition of a tyrant and... others.""*   
Fabien: *""Huh. So why stand up to him, then? Political ideals? Or did he just look at you funny?""*   
Phyre: *""No mortal has the right to be monarch.""*   
Fabien: *""I believe you. And yet, there's more to the story. You mentioned 'others...'""*   
Phyre: *""I have said all I desire to say about myself.""*  


>\[endgame\]  
*(...)* Safia: *""The Black Hand were at your throat when the British made their blockade.""*  


**02: Bringing terror to the ocean**

>Phyre: *""Three hundred years ago, I had a ship and a crew. We wrought such beautiful horrors.""*   
Phyre: *""Merchant ships, naval vessels, and others. We did not discriminate.""*   
Phyre: *""We would board. Stain white sails red. Turn entrails to rigging. How free we were, then.""*   
Fabien: *""I believe you. And yet, there's more to the story. You mentioned 'others...'""*   
Phyre: *""I have said all I desire to say about myself.""*  


>\[endgame\]  
*(...)* Safia: *""The Black Hand shredded your sails and drove you from the sea.""*

**03: Defending my homeland**

>Phyre: *""The Russian Tsar waged war on my homeland, hundreds of years after I left. The Crimean War.""*   
Phyre: *""I had long kept out of the country's struggles. But not this time.""*   
Phyre: *""We were not unsuccessful against the Tsar and... others.""*   
Fabien: *""I believe you. And yet, there's more to the story. You mentioned 'others...'""*   
Phyre: *""I have said all I desire to say about myself.""*  


>\[endgame\]  
*(...)* Safia: *""The Black Hand forced you to flee from Sevastopol, your tail between your legs.""*

\---

I wonder if most (if not all) of these can be considered canon. The choice of background (and, possibly, clan?) seems to branch out into the following, as acknowledged by Safia:

>*""The Janissary deserting the Sultan's house guard.""*   
*""The Vizier exiled from the Sultan's palace.""*   
*""The child born to the silver spoon, fleeing their family's disgrace.""*   
*""The criminal fleeing the consequences of their actions.""*   
*""The desperate rebel, exiled from Anatolia.""*   
*""The false prophet in the Sultan's court.""*   
*""The pathetic hostage fleeing the Kafes.""*

But that will be for another analysis. I hope this was enlightening, it certainly helped me understand the timeline of B2 a little better. ",28,1766673554.0,vtmb,6,0.92,False
1pveodl,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysiauni/comments/1pveodl/honest_reviewexperience_of_apu_diploma_in/,Honest review/experience of APU (diploma in mechatronics engineering),"Hope this helps anyone who's looking and is considering Apu. 
I'm barely a 3.0 cgpa 
(this is just my honest opinion based on my experience, not meant to slander) 

Started back in 27/11/2023 - 29/11/2025

Looking for uni back in May 2023, it was either APU/sunway/inti. One of the main reasons I chose Apu cuz it was only 8 stations away from my home (barely 23mins) and had 
""free shuttle bus"" (at that time I did not know most uni's had them)

Speaking of the shuttle bus. Don't bother following /checking the time table given. They are almost never accurate. If you miss the 12pm bus enjoy waiting till 2pm. Some of the drivers also have an attitude issue like how they'd try to tell you off when your shoes get their bus wet even tho it's literally raining. And how some of them have no issue overloading the bus by asking you stand inbetween the seat gaps and how some would strictly allow seated passengers. 

Thankfully the whole of 2025 I have been riding to Uni, much more convenient than driving or shuttle bus. Parking's free as long as you don't park in random spots, if you do hope you enjoy your new wheel ornament. 

As for parking, I rarely drove there I think I can only recall like 2-3 times my whole 2 years there. If you do have to park (indoors) try to park far from the elevator spots, your car is least likely to be damaged.  almost everyone in the uni with fresh bright red stickers park and drive like their license was clearly obtained via duit kopi. ""Tokyo drifting"" in the flooded parking lot, you can still visit the green wall which their cars slammed into. Oh yea make sure you got spare footwear in your cars cuz when it rains the indoor parking lot doubles as a reservoir. 

As for outdoor parking, try to avoid if you love your car. Sometimes when you're really lucky both sides would park very close to you, leaving you only to enter from your rear boot. When you confront them about it they'll say something about how there's no lines indicating a proper spot so they didn't knew. Oh ya don't be surprised if you car got hit/dent/dinged there's no cctv camera's out there so no point trying to fight and find the culprit, your only hope is that some good Samaritan recorded the entire thing. 

Now to the facilities. The gym is not beginner friendly, as there will be many ""tryhards/toxics"" (mfs think they're Chris bumstead after one phonk edit) if you don't mind being social and waiting for a turn (20-30mins as they would hog it) by all means go ahead. Anyway the gym is quite well equipped just don't expect anything fancy. Never used the showers, no comment. 

The pool has already been built just not open for using. It has been like that for the past 3 months for some reason. 

Library is like quite good ig I don't really read physical books or use any references from there. Really only go there for the ""quiet zone"" to do work. Depending on who's ""guarding"" the zone you might be asked to leave if you cough a little too hard or type with a noisy clicky keyboard. used to have strict rules on attire but I guess they stopped enforcing that, as I literally went in the other day with shorts and flip-flops and was not asked to leave. There are ""presentation/meeting"" rooms. But rarely ever used as it's intended purpose (usually gaming, on the rare occasion gooning, yes you read that right ). 

There are cricket/basketball/tennis (pickleball)court and football field. All which I can't really say much about as I've never booked or use them. I don't really know about the condition either as I haven't been on any other of each to judge them. 

Labs (engineering), as I'm taking an engineering course I can only really speak for the labs which I have been to. Couldn't be bothered to visit the other stem labs though they do look well equipped. 

As an engineering student you will be frequently going to these 3 labs. Lvl1 (drill), lvl3 (design/cad/cnc/plc), lvl4 (electronics/electricals). Make sure you do wear the proper attire otherwise you would be kicked out without question. According to the lab technician/assistant its because there are frequent visitors and potential students that would be enrolling so they would have to make sure the students are more presentable. The lab techs are usually easy going and very helpful, as long as you behave and actually care to learn. 

Most of the labs are properly equipped, though you would be disappointed to find out the CAD/CNC/lathe machines are only there for show. And I quote the lab tech ""the machines are really only here because it helps to promote the uni"" the lathe machine is not functioning as the uni wouldn't provide the fund for basic mantainance which let to it being ""broken"". As for the CNc machine, you won't see it in operation as it lacks the proper exhaust systems, because the uni wants to place it as close to the glass walls as possible to ""show off"" 500k dust collectors imo. 

Never used the robotic arm so can't really say much about it but it is pretty cool when the lab techs put it to use. 

 Finally the education experience part of this. 

If a lecturer starts off on your first day by saying something on the lines of ""I've been here for a very long time"" that's your first glowing red flag. I think every course can agree with me when I say this. Almost all the ""veterans"" constantly yap about how they can't wait to retire or get a better offer (if you deserve it wouldn't be working there for 13years) they literally would tell you that if you fail the higher ups would question them so they would try to avoid that but they would still proceed to mess you up anyway.

 What do I mean by this? Almost all the veterans that taught my modules, all of them share one thing in common is that they always take 1-2weeks leave in your 14 week semester which they would only Infrom you about the Friday before they leave. Some would have replacement class, some wouldn't. But don't be too happy about either cuz the replacement class some of which literally started at 7am in the morning, the cleaners have yet to arrive and the lects already go on about their lectures, without having a verbal/text agreement from the students. 

Most of the stuff they have in moodle don't matter, as it would be the lecturers that would be coming out with the questions some of those questions would be beyond your provided study materials (happened to me in 3 different modules).

Almost all the helpful lects are newcomers as they would do anything to help you as they would want a clean track record. Some of those lects would be so good as to teach you and guide through the modules, some of those lessons I still remember it clearly. Also might ""allegedly"" get a lecturer who's good enough to ""allegedly"" give you 1:1 copy of the final exam paper for you to practice with the full marking scheme answers provided, allegedly. 

Anyways good lecturers rarely last long. 6 of my lecturers who were good to us, 3 of them already left to other uni's. All within a year they left. 

As for other experiences I can't really say much about, I'm not really a social person. Joined many clubs but as a ghost member. 

You could have one of those ""dream"" uni experience if you really work into it, there's always activities /volunteerings. 

Food's meh, rm8-12 range unless you load up I usually only get coffee so I can't really give a proper review for all the food stalls. But the subway's good. 

Annoyingly Apu being a tech uni, you could top up your ID card online but you still have to queue to have your card verified after top up. 

I can't really rate apu as this is my first uni, don't really have any other experience/benchmark to rate it from. 

Still unsure whether I'll return for my degree here. 

Anyway this is my full review (just realized this is more of a rant) of APU as a diploma in mechatronics engineering. ",0,1766673541.0,malaysiauni,0,0.5,False

I recently joined a college near Adibatla as an assistant professor and shifted to this area for the first time. I honestly did not expect it to feel this lonely.

In college everyone already seems to have their own groups. I mostly sit alone, eat alone and go back to my PG alone. Outside college it is the same. I do not know anyone here and I am not familiar with the nearby places either. I go for tea alone, food alone, coffee alone, everything alone. Some days it really hits hard.

I am not depressed or anything, but the isolation is heavy. I miss having someone to talk to or just walk around with or explore the area together.
If you have recently shifted to Adibatla for work or studies and are also feeling a bit lost or alone, please reach out. We do not have to become best friends. Even small things like talking, evening walks, chai breaks or discovering places nearby together would help a lot.

\-When she holds Anderson in her huge plaid dress, and is clearly uncomfortable, she mentions ""we match,"" while Anderson ignores her, looks over her shoulder for Yar and then she says, ""We're gonna have to take a little selfie together, aren't we??"" 

\-""I'm gonna wet your hair a little bit and get those curls 'poppin.'"" The cringe level is unreal and disturbing with this statement.

Entire thing except rough cutting and sanding was made using hand tools, from prep to joinery.

I also took the opportunity to use my new kerfing plane I made with my dad when resawing - sadly it did not help my poor sawing skills.

The entire shelf was finished using beeswax as to keep as much as possible of that unfinished oak color as I wanted it over the darker tones of oil finished oak. 

Whole process took about a month and a half not working on it everyday. 

Thanks to you people for being good such good inspirations and woodworkers! I wish you all a wonderful end of this year and many more great projects coming your way.

Now?

It’s quiet coffee.

Still wearing pajamas at noon.

Hiding in the bathroom for five minutes of peace.

Mentally preparing for people.

Some of us are hosting.

Some of us are hiding.

Some of us are just trying to recharge without guilt.

This is your reminder:

There is no “right” way to do Christmas anymore.

So tell us—

What does your Christmas morning actually look like now?

No filters. No highlight reel. Just real life.
