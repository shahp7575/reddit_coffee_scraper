Eu normalmente pefriro algo mais frutado e floral, então robusta é o completo oposto do que gosto.



Cheiro: sempre me lembra o tradicional que fazem no trabalho... é o cheiro do robusta e não tem muito o que fazer.

Cor: quase piche. mesmo fazendo bem diluido (1:15, 1:20), ainda é bem escuro.



Mas no gosto me surpreendeu. É forte, encorpado, bem achocolatado.

Tava usando uma temperatura bem baixa, então ficou docinho. Mesmo errando, bem quente fica um pouco amargo, mas deixando um pouco de lado pra esfriar um pouco, dai mostra outra cara o café.

  
Fiz espresso com ele e que espresso... só aumentou as caracteristicas.



Mesmo não sendo o tipo que gosto, é um café que tomaria de boa e provavelmente vou ir atrás dele de novo outra hora.

Robusta tem mais cafeína, então cuidado... todas as vezes que tomei uma dose dupla acabei demorando pra pegar no sono depois kkkkkkk

  
Por fim, quero deixar como sugestão pra recomendar a quem estiver começando nos cafés especiais. É bem ""perfil brasileiro"", tem o cheiro e cor do café que já estão acostumados mas com um sabor bem intenso e complexo.",1,1756902012.0,cafebrasil,0,1.0,False

You Are Here → Stage 1: The Detonation Zone (aka The ""What the Actual F*ck?"" Phase)

This is the immediate aftermath. The bomb has gone off, and you're stumbling around with your ears ringing, trying to figure out if that's your leg or a table leg over there.

 * What it Feels Like: You're the main character in a poorly written disaster movie. You're either completely numb, operating on pure adrenaline and a diet of caffeine and spite, or you're weeping uncontrollably because you saw a dog that looked happy. There is no in-between.

 * Your Only Job Right Now: Survive. That's it. Breathe. Drink water. Try to eat a goddamn vegetable. Do not make any major life decisions that aren't about immediate safety. Your brain is a scrambled egg; it is not fit for executive functions.

 * Kickass Tip: Your mantra is ""Just for today."" Can you get through just today without lighting your life on fire? Yes. Yes, you can. Also, do not get bangs. I repeat, step away from the scissors. Bangs are not a solution; they are a cry for help that you'll have to grow out for two years.

Stage 2: The Shit-Show Safari (The Anger & Blame Phase)

The numbness is wearing off, and now you're just pissed. At your ex. At their lawyer. At your lawyer. At that one friend who said, ""Everything happens for a reason."" You want to key their car with that platitude.

 * What it Feels Like: You are a human Molotov cocktail looking for a place to land. Every song on the radio is a personal attack. You spend your nights composing brilliant, scathing emails that you are (hopefully) smart enough not to send.

 * Your Job: Find a healthy outlet for the rage before you end up in a viral YouTube freakout video. This is the time to lift heavy things, take up kickboxing, sprint until you can't feel your legs, or scream into a pillow. Anger is pure fuel. Use it to power your workouts, not your text messages.

 * Kickass Tip: Create a ""Fuck-It Bucket."" This is the opposite of a bucket list. It’s a list of all the petty, wonderful things you can do now that you're single. Eat garlic bread in bed. Watch 8 straight hours of that dumb show they hated. Leave the toilet seat in whatever goddamn position you want. It's childish, it's petty, and it's glorious.

Stage 3: The Ghost Mall (The Bargaining & Deep Sadness Phase)

The fire of your rage has died down, and now it's just cold. This is the stage of ""what ifs"" and ""if onlys."" The loneliness is a physical presence. It sits on your chest while you try to sleep.

 * What it Feels Like: You're wandering through a shopping mall at 3 AM. All the stores are closed, the lights are dim, and the only soundtrack is the sad, echoing part of a Celine Dion song. You're haunted by the ghosts of good memories, which are often more painful than the bad ones.

 * Your Job: Feel it. This is the part everyone tries to skip. Don't. You can't outrun this wave, so you might as well learn to surf it. Cry. Be miserable. This is you metabolizing the pain. If you numb it with booze, casual sex, or obsessive work, it will just be waiting for you later, bigger and uglier.

 * Kickass Tip: Implement the 5-Minute Rule. If you get the overwhelming urge to check their social media, look at old photos, or otherwise poke the wound, set a timer for 5 minutes. You can wallow for exactly 300 seconds. When the timer goes off, you must get up and do one productive thing: put a dish away, do a push-up, reply to one email. It’s harm reduction for the heartbroken.

Stage 4: The Fog Begins to Lift (The ""Oh, Right, I'm a Person"" Phase)

One day, you'll wake up and realize you slept through the whole night. Or you'll laugh at a joke and it won't feel forced. Or you'll go an entire hour without thinking about them. These moments are fragile glimmers of life.

 * What it Feels Like: You're waking up from a long, nasty flu. You're still weak, but you're starting to notice the sun is shining and you might actually be hungry for something other than emotional garbage.

 * Your Job: Start rebuilding. Who are you without them? Reconnect with friends you lost in the couple-bubble. Re-engage with a hobby you dropped. Figure out what you actually like. This is the awkward, clumsy process of re-learning how to be a ""me"" instead of a ""we.""

 * Kickass Tip: Date yourself. Seriously. Take yourself out to a nice dinner. Go to a movie alone. Buy yourself the good coffee. You need to prove to your own damn self that you are kickass company before you even think about inviting someone else to the party.

Stage 5: The Kintsugi Phase (Radical Acceptance & Rebuilding)

Kintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with lacquer mixed with powdered gold. The philosophy is that the piece is more beautiful for having been broken. This is you.

 * What it Feels Like: It's not about ""being healed"" or ""over it."" It's about integration. The divorce is part of your story. The scars are there, but they're not ugly wounds anymore; they're gold seams that prove you survived something that was meant to shatter you. You don't hate your ex anymore; you might feel nothing, or a distant, quiet sadness for what was lost.

 * Your Job: Live. Take the lessons from your Moral Inventory and apply them. Build a life that is so rich and fulfilling that your past trauma becomes a footnote, not the headline.

 * Kickass Tip: Stop telling the ""sad divorce story."" You know the one. The script you recite at parties. It's time for a rewrite. Start telling the ""badass survival and rebirth story."" The narrative of your life is yours to control. Give yourself a better script, because you're the hero of this story, not the victim.

The Fine Print: You will bounce between these stages like a goddamn pinball. You might go from Kintsugi all the way back to the Shit-Show Safari in the space of an afternoon because you smelled their shampoo on a stranger. It's okay. It's not a failure; it's the process.

This is your becoming. It's messy, brutal, and profoundly beautiful. Now, go be the badass you were forged to be.

1n7d8x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheImprovementRoom/comments/1n7d8x3/20_lessons_men_learn_too_late_in_life_i_wish/,20 Lessons Men Learn too Late in Life (I wish someone told me this at 20),"I keep having these ""where the hell was this advice when I needed it"" moments.

Stuff that would have saved me years of confusion, embarrassment, and straight-up bad decisions. Things that seem obvious now but felt impossible to figure out when I was younger.

Here's what I wish someone had pulled me aside and told me before I learned it the hard way.

1. Your 20s are for figuring it out, not having it figured out. Stop panicking because you don't have a 10-year plan. Most successful people changed directions multiple times.
2. Lifting weights isn't about looking good, it's about feeling good. The confidence boost from being physically strong affects everything else in your life.
3. Learn to cook 5 solid meals. You'll save money, eat better, and people will think you're more attractive. Win-win-win.
4. Your parents were just winging it too. They didn't have all the answers. They were figuring it out as they went, just like you are now.
5. Comparison is the thief of joy .That guy's highlight reel isn't your behind-the-scenes reality. Focus on your own race.
6. Invest early, even if it's just $50 a month. Compound interest is magic, but only if you start early. Your 65-year-old self will thank you.
7. Learn to say no without explaining yourself. ""I can't make it"" is a complete sentence. Stop over-explaining and giving people ammunition to argue.
8. Your mental health is as important as your physical health. Therapy isn't for broken people. It's for people who want to get better at being human.
9. Quality over quantity applies to everything. Friends, clothes, experiences, relationships. Better to have a few great things than many mediocre ones.
10. Learn basic home maintenance. Unclogging a drain, changing a tire, using basic tools. YouTube is your friend, incompetence is expensive.
11. Your job is not your identity. What you do for money doesn't define who you are. Don't let work consume your entire sense of self.
12. Sleep is not for the weak. 8 hours of sleep will do more for your productivity than 3 cups of coffee and pure willpower
13. Learn to listen more than you talk. People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. Ask questions, listen to answers.
14. Grooming and style matter more than you think. You don't need to be handsome, you just need to look like you give a damn about yourself.
15. Have uncomfortable conversations early. That awkward talk you're avoiding will only get more awkward with time. Rip the band-aid off.
16. Your gut instinct is usually right. If something feels off, it probably is. Trust that inner voice, even when you can't explain why.
17. Learn to apologize properly. ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" isn't an apology. Take responsibility, acknowledge impact, do better.
18. Build genuine relationships before you need them. Network by helping others, not by asking for favors. Be useful, not needy.
19. Your comfort zone is a beautiful place, but nothing grows there. The things that scare you are usually the things you need to do most.
20. Time goes faster than you think. That ""someday"" you keep talking about needs a date on the calendar. Someday is not a day of the week.

Which lesson hits you the hardest? Which one do you wish you'd learned sooner?

In the past when we used to be on the same continent as our parents, I was keen to travel to new places and tried to avoid to go to his family or my family every summer.   
Ever since we got married, he has been so persistent that he wants to spend around 2 to 3 weeks of the summer in his family house that he has been coming since he was a child.    
This is a nightmare for me, because it takes a day and a half to get to his family house, have to deal with his controlling mother 24/7 bear with the mess and the unhygienic way of living.  For example, if I try to cook something, his mother will literally stand to me all the time and comment etc, if I try to do the laundry it is the same. If I go to shower I need to shower as quick as possible because the shower doesnt work properly. Every move is monitored - heck, even when I try to make a coffee in the morning she is standing next to me and monitors what I am up to.

My husband does not get it that I dont want to spend every summer here. I said to him that we should either buy a house by the sea (since he loves the sea so much) since we have the money to do so, but he doesnt want. The only way would be to buy a house next to his family house so he can still comes at the same place every summer.   
Jusr fyi, I do not visit my family every summer, so I do not drag him in my family home to spend evey summer with my family. He says it’s not his problem that I do not go to my family home where my parents live every summer.  

I told him to start coming alone since I enrolled back to University and my studying was more important. He kind of indirectly forced me to come and here am I - impossible to focus on studying or writing. I asked him for us to leave earlier na she is against it. 

I just dont know what to do any more of moving forward.

1n7d56l,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1n7d56l/marinas_journey_to_freedom_how_one_woman_found/,"Marina’s Journey to Freedom: How One Woman Found Independence, Respect, and Inner Strength Amid Family Tensions"," Marina felt a rare sense of calm for the first time in a week. Sitting in her home office, she leaned back slightly in her chair, sorting through documents while simultaneously checking her bank balance. The number on the screen was slowly approaching the goal she had set for herself. In just a month, she would be able to buy the white SUV she had been eyeing at the dealership. She closed her eyes for a moment, imagining herself behind the wheel of her new car—the sense of independence, freedom from endless requests from her husband, and not having to adjust to his schedule. No more borrowing his car, waiting twenty minutes at bus stops, or hauling heavy folders on her shoulders. For the first time in years, Marina allowed herself to dream of a life that could be a little simpler and more comfortable.



As the evening sun dipped toward the horizon, Marina sat down beside her husband on the sofa to share the news. Oliver, not looking up from his phone, nodded distractedly.



— “Good. Just make sure it’s practical, not some toy,” he muttered without raising his head.



Marina raised an eyebrow.

— “I’ve already decided. A white SUV, economical, spacious. Perfect for my client visits.”



At that moment, the familiar clink of a cup on a saucer and a low grumble came from the kitchen. Charlotte, her mother-in-law, appeared, drying her hands on a towel and deliberately pausing in the doorway. She had an uncanny talent for showing up at exactly the moment when the young couple discussed something important.



— “Why do you need a second car?” she asked, her tone as if she were administering an exam. “One car per family is plenty. Oliver goes to work, comes home in the evening. And you—what, drive everywhere every day?”



Marina felt her shoulders tense instinctively. She knew that any word could trigger a new attack.



— “Charlotte,” she began calmly, trying not to give in to emotion, “my work involves constant travel. Three times a week I visit clients, sometimes in other towns. Public transport makes this very inconvenient.”



— “Oh, come on,” her mother-in-law waved dismissively. “We managed just fine before. Your father-in-law and I drove one car all our lives. And nothing happened. Now everyone must have a car.”



Marina noticed Oliver retreating into silence, unwilling to defend her. It irritated her further. She clenched her hands into fists.



— “With all due respect,” she said firmly, “these are my earnings, and I decide how to spend them. I need the car for work.”



Charlotte narrowed her eyes, as if trying to peer into Marina’s hidden motives.



— “Your money?” she snapped sharply. “Who bought your apartment? Who paid for your wedding? Or do you think family means everyone for themselves?”



Finally, Oliver spoke, softly:

— “Mother, don’t interfere in our affairs. Marina earns her own money and makes her own decisions.”



Charlotte glared at her son, feeling betrayed. Her eyes glistened slightly, but she did not argue further.



— “Fine. I’ll leave, then. Just remember—this won’t bring you any good,” she said, retreating with a faint rustle, leaving an almost tangible tension in the air.



For the next two weeks, the household was filled with strained silence. Charlotte spoke to Marina only when necessary, while spending long hours with Oliver in conversations where Marina felt invisible, yet under constant scrutiny. She sensed her mother-in-law’s gaze cutting across her like knives, realizing that any mistake could be weaponized.



When preparations began for Charlotte’s sixtieth birthday, the tension escalated.



— “Oliver, I’m turning sixty!” she declared loudly at breakfast. “This is a serious milestone. I want to celebrate it properly.”



— “Of course, Mum. What do you have in mind?” Oliver replied, swallowing a bite of bread and trying to stay out of conflict.



— “A restaurant,” she said. “A nice one downtown. I’ll invite all my friends, former colleagues, Aunt Helen from the suburbs, and Vladimir with his family. About twenty people in total.”



Marina choked slightly on her coffee. She understood this would be an expensive affair, but Oliver stayed silent.



— “Twenty people? Charlotte, that’s a lot of money,” she ventured cautiously.



— “And what, are you begrudging me money?” her mother-in-law squinted. “Or do you think I don’t deserve a proper celebration?”



— “No, of course you deserve it,” Marina replied, trying to remain calm.



— “No ‘of course.’ I only turn sixty once in a lifetime. I want everyone to remember this day,” Charlotte said firmly, shutting the door on any objections.



Oliver once again withdrew into himself, staring at the butter and bread with an expression that seemed to say he wasn’t there.



The next weeks were a frenzy. Charlotte called friends and relatives, finalized the menu, ordered flowers, inspected the restaurant, and planned the music. She glowed with anticipation, as if the success of her entire life depended on the evening. Marina watched from the sidelines, occasionally attempting to gently inquire about costs, but Oliver responded evasively:



— “Mum has it all under control. Don’t worry; we’ll manage somehow.”



Marina understood that any doubt she expressed would be seen as an attack, so she kept her emotions in check, continuing to save for her car.



The day of the birthday arrived. The restaurant was indeed beautiful, with panoramic windows, fresh flowers on the tables, soft lighting, and impeccable service. Guests arrived one after another, filling the hall with laughter, chatter, and a gentle bustle.



Marina had to admit: Charlotte knew how to make an impression. She flitted between tables, receiving congratulations, telling jokes, laughing openly. Guests admired her charisma and ability to host a perfect celebration.



— “Charlotte, you have such a lovely daughter-in-law!” Aunt Helen chirped, nodding toward Marina. “And she’s hardworking too, I’ve heard. A solid position in a reputable firm.”



— “Yes, hardworking,” Charlotte replied dryly. “Working. Planning to buy herself a car, while not a penny goes to her elderly in-laws. But a car for herself—no problem.”



Marina felt her cheeks burn but turned to the window, hiding her emotions. The guests exchanged glances, sensing the subtle insult. It was a deliberate attempt to belittle her, to show she was “selfish and spoiled.”



The evening continued with courses served one after another, toasts made, songs sung, and laughter shared. Charlotte remained the center of attention, occasionally casting a pointed look at Marina—a mixture of malice and expectation—but Marina ignored it, focusing inward.



When the waiter brought the bill, the tension reached its peak. He politely placed the folder with the check in front of the birthday woman. Charlotte glanced at it briefly, then unexpectedly handed it to Marina.



— “Why are you staring? Pay the bill—it will be my gift,” she said loudly, clearly for all to hear.



The room froze. Guests fell silent; conversation became awkward. Marina stared at the check, stunned. The sum was enormous, even for her accustomed spending. Oliver went pale, opening his mouth, but no words came out.



Charlotte, confident in her triumph, looked at her daughter-in-law with unmistakable glee. She had planned to humiliate Marina publicly, achieving two goals at once: shame her and block the car purchase.



Marina took a deep breath and felt the calm she had cultivated for a month return. She slowly pushed the folder aside and, looking Charlotte in the eyes, said:



— “You know what, Charlotte? I left home lightly today. No credit cards, no phone. I have more important expenses than throwing money at people you gossip about afterward.”



Her mother-in-law turned crimson with anger.



— “What are you saying?!” she hissed.



Marina continued, unwavering:



— “The money I earn is for improving my life. If someone wants to throw a party at their own expense, that’s their choice, but I will not pay for someone else’s whims, especially if they aim to humiliate me.”



Oliver tried to intervene, but Marina raised her hand:



— “No, Oliver. Today, this is my stance. And I am proud to assert it calmly, without shouting or scandals.”



Guests watched with genuine interest. Some exchanged quiet glances; others widened their eyes in surprise. Even the waiter, accustomed to eccentric clients, raised his eyebrows.



Charlotte froze. Her plan had failed. She had wanted to humiliate Marina publicly, but instead faced calm composure and firm resolve. She felt the collapse of her strategy pressing on her.



Marina felt lightness and inner triumph. She knew there would be further conversations and manipulations, but for the first time, she realized that no attempt at public humiliation could shake her confidence. She smiled, lifting her gaze to the guests and quietly added:



— “A celebration can be wonderful without forcing anyone to pay for personal ambitions.”



Guests applauded softly, some nodding in respect, while distant relatives clearly recognized it as a lesson in dignity and courage. Oliver, though embarrassed, nodded subtly. For the first time in a long while, he saw his wife as truly strong.



Charlotte was left speechless, her face revealing a mixture of anger and dismay. She attempted to continue the celebration with a smile, but her triumphant mood had vanished.



Marina, sitting at the table and observing the world around her, felt that the first step toward her independence had been taken. Soon, her SUV would be parked in the garage, and with it, the sense of freedom and control over her own life.






Over the following months, Marina bought the SUV. Sitting behind the wheel for the first time, she felt the freedom fill her every breath and movement. Each trip through the city became a small celebration: no more waiting for Oliver, no need to borrow a car, no restrictions on routes. Every kilometer symbolized autonomy—a quiet victory over past limitations imposed by her mother-in-law.



Charlotte, observing this, felt a mix of irritation and helplessness. She realized her usual methods no longer worked. Any attempt at control now met a wall of calm determination and self-assurance.



Marina understood that real independence wasn’t just about money or material objects but the ability to assert boundaries calmly and confidently, unshaken by others’ opinions or ambitions.



Slowly, the household’s atmosphere stabilized. Charlotte learned to respect Marina’s boundaries. Oliver grew to see his wife as a partner, not a mediator in family conflicts. Marina thrived in her career, traveling freely to meet clients and manage projects, experiencing the joy of life on her own terms.



One evening, as the family gathered for dinner, Charlotte unexpectedly said:



— “Marina, I… I want to thank you. For showing that one can stand their ground calmly and confidently. I’ve probably been too harsh before.”



Marina smiled gently:

— “Thank you, Charlotte. We’re all learning to live together. I’m glad you understand.”



Oliver quietly smiled:

— “See, Mum? Life can be calm without drama.”



Charlotte nodded, a subtle but meaningful acknowledgment: Marina was no longer just “the daughter-in-law” but a full-fledged family member whose opinions mattered.



From then on, life returned to normal, but on new terms. Marina no longer felt pressure or humiliation. Charlotte gradually adapted, and Oliver became an equal partner. Each learned that respect and independence were more valuable than control and manipulation.

  

Every trip in her SUV reminded Marina of that restaurant day—the day she said “no” firmly and calmly, emerging victorious. Her internal world had transformed: she no longer feared judgment or manipulation. Calmness and confidence became her foundation for new achievements.



Even as new challenges arose, Marina met them with a smile and inner strength, knowing her life belonged solely to her. True victory, she realized, was not in money, gifts, or public statements, but in the ability to remain herself, defend her boundaries, and maintain dignity and freedom.

In the following weeks, the household settled into a quieter rhythm. Charlotte, though still proud and occasionally sharp-tongued, had begun to navigate around Marina’s boundaries rather than trying to push them. She no longer made passive-aggressive remarks or staged small tests; when she needed assistance, she began asking politely, sometimes even seeking Marina’s advice. Marina noticed these subtle shifts and responded with warmth, understanding that respect was being built slowly, step by step.



Oliver, too, grew more attentive and engaged. He started involving himself in family decisions rather than letting his mother dominate the conversation. He discovered that a partnership built on mutual respect and trust made their life easier—and their home calmer. He watched Marina flourish with pride, finally seeing her not just as his wife but as a strong, independent woman capable of handling challenges on her own.



Marina’s work thrived. Each business trip became a symbol of her independence. Driving her SUV through unfamiliar streets of nearby cities, meeting clients without having to coordinate schedules with Oliver or anyone else, she felt a sense of ownership over her time and energy that she had never experienced before. Each kilometer behind the wheel reminded her of that restaurant evening—the moment when she had stood her ground and gained her dignity without shouting, without tears, and without compromise.



Even Charlotte, observing Marina’s calm confidence and seeing how much Oliver respected his wife, began to reassess her approach. She realized that commanding and controlling others was no longer effective. Respect, she noticed, had a far stronger impact than fear or intimidation. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, she began to soften. She asked Marina for advice on household matters, consulted her about gifts for distant relatives, and even complimented her on her professional achievements. Marina, in turn, treated these overtures with courteous attention, understanding that this was a fragile but important reconciliation.



One quiet Sunday evening, the three of them sat in the living room, sipping tea. Charlotte finally spoke with a sincere tone:



— “Marina, I must admit… you’ve taught me something. Standing firm doesn’t have to be confrontational. I’ve been too strict and too eager to control.”



Marina smiled gently.

— “Thank you, Charlotte. It’s a learning process for all of us. We’re finding a way to live together without stepping on each other’s boundaries.”



Oliver raised his cup with a small smile:

— “See? A little respect goes a long way.”



For the first time, the household felt genuinely balanced. Marina no longer felt like a subordinate in her own home. Charlotte, though strong-willed, had begun to see her daughter-in-law as an equal, someone whose decisions mattered. And Oliver, bridging the gap between them, finally understood the importance of mutual respect and independence.



Marina continued to drive her SUV, attend client meetings across town, and manage her projects with a newfound sense of freedom. Each trip, each completed task, each decision made without interference reinforced her sense of self. She felt empowered, knowing that she could navigate any situation—personal or professional—with poise and calm authority.



Life didn’t become free of challenges, of course. Charlotte still had her moods, unexpected comments occasionally arose, and new situations tested Marina’s patience. But now, Marina faced them with confidence, grounded in her knowledge that she could assert her boundaries and defend her independence without losing composure.



One evening, as Marina parked her SUV in the driveway after a long day of client visits, she paused to look at the soft glow of the city lights. Oliver came up beside her, handing her a cup of coffee, and whispered:



— “I’m glad we’ve reached this point. You’ve changed everything for us—for me, for all of us.”



Marina took a sip, smiling at the reflection of the lights in the windshield.

— “I feel the same, Oliver. And the best part is… our life now belongs to us. No one else sets the rules.”



Together, they watched the city hum quietly below them, feeling a rare serenity. Marina knew that life would continue to challenge her, that there would always be moments when she needed to assert herself. But she also knew, deep in her heart, that she had discovered a vital truth: independence was not merely financial or practical—it was an inner strength, a calm certainty, and the courage to be herself fully.



And as she closed the car door and walked into her home, Marina felt a deep satisfaction. Her SUV was more than a vehicle—it was a symbol of freedom, of personal power, and of the confidence to navigate life on her own terms. The restaurant confrontation, the months of tension, the subtle daily battles—they had all shaped her. She was no longer merely reactive; she was proactive, steady, and unafraid.



From that evening on, every drive became a reminder of her victory, a quiet celebration of self-respect and inner strength. The lessons she had learned, born out of conflict and challenge, now guided her daily life. She understood that the true measure of power was calm confidence, and the most significant triumphs were the ones that could not be measured in money, influence, or recognition—but in the quiet freedom to live according to one’s own principles.



And so, Marina drove on—through the streets of the city, through new projects, and through life itself—with a steady hand, an independent heart, and an unshakable sense that her life, finally, truly belonged to her.

In the weeks that followed, life at home settled into a new rhythm. Charlotte still had her moments of pride and occasional sharp remarks, but she no longer tried to dominate Marina. She began to approach her daughter-in-law with respect, occasionally seeking her advice or insight. Marina responded kindly but firmly, understanding that respect had to be mutual and consistent.



Oliver noticed the transformation too. He started taking a more active role in the household and in family decisions, learning to balance his mother’s expectations with his wife’s autonomy. He realized that supporting Marina’s independence did not diminish his bond with his mother—it strengthened their family. Slowly, a sense of harmony returned to their home.



Marina herself flourished. Each day behind the wheel of her SUV, each successful client meeting, reinforced her sense of freedom. She was no longer constrained by schedules dictated by others or by silent expectations. She could plan her days, make her own decisions, and pursue her career without interference. Her independence was now visible, tangible, and deeply satisfying.



One evening, as she returned from a particularly successful business trip, Oliver greeted her at the door with a smile.



— “You’ve changed everything for us,” he said softly. “I’m proud of how you’ve handled everything.”



Marina smiled, feeling the warmth of accomplishment.

— “It wasn’t just me,” she replied. “We’re learning together. Respect, independence, trust—these are what make a family strong.”



Charlotte, watching quietly from the living room, felt a mix of irritation and reluctant admiration. She realized that her old methods of control no longer worked, and perhaps never would. Slowly, she began to accept that Marina was no longer the timid, dependent daughter-in-law she once tried to manipulate. Marina was strong, assertive, and capable—an equal in every sense.



Over time, the dynamics in the household transformed completely. Charlotte became less controlling, more considerate, and occasionally even sought Marina’s opinion genuinely. Oliver became a more attentive husband, partner, and mediator. And Marina, with each passing day, felt more confident in her ability to navigate challenges—both professional and personal—with grace and authority.



One quiet evening, the three of them sat together over tea. Charlotte, tentatively smiling, spoke first:



— “Marina… I want to thank you. You’ve shown me that strength doesn’t always come from authority or control. Sometimes it comes from calm confidence.”



Marina returned the smile warmly:

— “Thank you, Charlotte. We all grow from each other. And I’m glad we’re finding our balance.”



Oliver raised his cup with a small grin:

— “See? Calm and respect—works every time.”



From that moment on, life in the household moved forward on healthier terms. Marina continued to pursue her career, traveling freely, managing projects efficiently, and enjoying the independence her SUV provided. Every drive reminded her of the pivotal restaurant evening—the night she first said “no” with unwavering calm, earning respect without anger, drama, or tears.



She knew there would be challenges ahead. Charlotte could still test her patience, new situations would arise, and tensions might flare occasionally. But Marina now had the inner strength to face them without fear. She had discovered a vital truth: true independence comes from self-respect, calm confidence, and the courage to live life according to one’s principles…………..

I decided to write about Maggie's characters (but our beloved idiots are in there as well because I love writing their bickering too much 😁).

**Tags:** Fluff, Sweet, POV Maggie, Post-Canon, Established Relationship

**Summary:** Whickber Street is back to normal. Everyone is happy, the world is bright and beautiful, Mr Fell is back, Mr Crowley is at the very least content and Maggie doesn't have to go on pining any more either. Business as usual - including the lack of sales in Maggie's shop *The Small Back Room*. Until Maggie notices a strange and significant increase in orders from her webshop...

**Excerpt:**

“What about it?” Maggie asked, putting a pot on the drying rack after cleaning it. They were almost done now. Whenever they spent evenings in each other’s homes they would cook, eat and clean up together afterwards. It was just everyday life, but Maggie loved this ritual of theirs and, even if there would be days in the future where one or the other was too drained, she would always cherish these nights and try to make them happen whenever possible. It always made her feel like home.

“You know the one that’s been acting up?” Nina asked but didn’t pause to get confirmation. “It’s not now. Acting up, that is. It’s working perfectly, all the time. As if someone had come by and said: ‘This bloody temperamental machine, working only when it sodding well wants - it’s not on! It’s got to behave!’” she said, pointing and glowering at the pot as if it were the espresso machine in question. Maggie almost felt sorry for it. “I’m not complaining,” Nina repeated, “it’s just so… odd.”

“As long as you’re not complaining,” Maggie murmured which earned her a playful swat with the towel. “That’s damp with dishwater!” Maggie complained, but she was laughing as she twisted out of the way as well as she could before the towel could swat her again.

“So are your hands,” Nina said and planted a quick kiss on her cheek.

For a moment they continued their task in silence while Maggie thought about how to put the events of her day into words. “Something odd happened in my shop today as well,” she began, her eyes fixed on the movements of her hands as she put the clean pan on the drying rack. Sometimes it was easier to find words that way; she wasn’t really seeing what she was doing, her attention focussed inward.

“Yeah?” Nina prompted expectedly, “Found another strange jukebox that changes all records to a specific song?”

“Oh, goodness, no!” Maggie laughed. She still didn’t know entirely what that had been about, but it must have had something to do with Jim and all those colleagues of Mr Fell and Mr Crowley that had shown up - and she really didn’t want to get mixed up with anything like that again. “I had a bunch of orders through my online shop today.”

Nina put the dried pan away and grabbed the cutlery on the drying rack next. “Isn’t that a good thing, though?”

“Oh, it was certainly good. Just– well, odd. The number of them,” Maggie said a bit hesitantly.

Do You Hide Your Smile Too?,"For years, she searched for a **dentist in Pune**, scrolling through endless **dentist near me** results, hoping to find someone who could help her. Coffee stains, years of neglect, and the embarrassment of discolored teeth made her avoid every camera, every group photo, even the mirror at times. Living between Kothrud and her workplace in PCMC, she always found a reason to postpone treatment, convincing herself that nothing would really change.

The struggle wasn’t just cosmetic—it was emotional. She stopped laughing openly in conversations. At work, she covered her mouth during presentations. At family functions, she quietly stepped out of the frame when pictures were taken. The hurt of seeing her younger cousins post carefree, smiling photos online cut deeper than she admitted. Failed attempts with over-the-counter strips and painful home remedies only made her feel more hopeless.

Then, one day, she decided to try one last option and walked into [Burute Dental](https://g.co/kgs/nAcnFkV), meeting **Dr. Burute**. That single whitening session wasn’t just about brighter teeth—it was about lifting years of shame off her shoulders. For the first time in years, she looked at her reflection and saw a smile she didn’t want to hide.

The win was small but life-changing: she laughed out loud at dinner with her friends in PCMC, unafraid of the camera flashes around her. The joy wasn’t just in her teeth—it was in finally feeling free.

I’ve been putting together some fun, low-prep activities for my kids that work well during homeschool downtime (or when I need 20 minutes to reset with a coffee 😅). They’ve been a big hit for us, especially on rainy days or when we want something hands-on and screen-free.

Some examples we’ve tried:

* Quick printable scavenger hunts around the house
* Simple logic puzzles and word games
* Creative challenges like “build the tallest tower with X items”
* Group activities that siblings can do together

Since it’s been working so well here, I bundled a bunch of these into a little printable pack. If anyone wants to check it out, I’m happy to share a free sample or two — just DM me.

When I met him, he was already distancing himself from God and church. I made it clear I'm atheist from the get go and he didn't mind. I believe he liked that about me because he was ready himself to convert to atheism. 

His family is very, very religious, and mine are all atheists.

Also, he is an foreigner, who brought his whole family over to the country couple of years ago. He's been here for 8 years, they came about 4-5 years ago. It's still happening as his cousin came to this country literally week ago. 

I was afraid to meet his family for that reason and we were both afraid if our families could ever meet and blend. 

But then i met his parents and siblings and they were super nice to me. They avoid talking about faith with me and I respect that. In the same time my fiance met my parents and siblings and they got along very nice as well. Then our families met and they also were all very nice to each other. 

So fast forward 2 years and where are we now? 

I don't like his extended family. His parents and siblings are nice, but every aunt and cousin i have ever met, refuses to talk to me and around me in language of the country we are in, which they know. So on Christmas, birthdays etc. I just sit there when they talk and I don't understand anything. I wanted to learn the language but my fiance said it's a slang with 3 languages mixed in and it's almost impossible for me to learn. 

Furthermore, although his parents are nice, they are very hard to be around. His father is narcissistic and has a huge problem with alcohol. He treats his wife poorly and is very loud. His mother is no better, as she's very prude and shy, and she is so uninteresting to talk to that every conversation is just so so exhausting. I tried to make friends with her but she only can talk about very shallow things as she has never learned to talk about what she really thinks. I like them, they are nice, I really do, but I can't stand them long-term. Sometimes we organize meetings and trips with them and it's ok, but I always feel super exhausted afterwards. They are also very dependent on my fiance. He owns his small company and he hired his father and brother. He is responsible for everything, their banking, their vacations, their investments, their legal stuff etc. They call with every little thing, and now he also wants to take a loan in his name so they could buy a house. 

It's not like it's just me; he feels about them exactly how I do and maybe even worse!

When it comes to my parents though they almost adopted him as of now. My mom adores his humor and witty jokes, and he adores her for being such and independent strong women who helped me in many ways. My father is his best friend. Thay are in constant communication, they have many same interests, he calls him dad already. 

My fiancé is constantly choosing my parents over his, meetings with them are chill and relaxing, while meetings with his parents are always exhausting.  He is the one who initiates them more often than I do. 

Also, he realized now how much damage his parents did to him when he grew up - alcoholic father and mother who used to tell him she's about to kill herself. Also they used faith to manipulate him. They also physically tortured him and he moved away at 16. 

We are still cordial with them and we do family stuff, but they are constantly comparing themselves to my parents and how we are not visiting enough (he sees them almost everyday at work / visits once a week, and we together visit them 1-2 times a month). 

Yesterday we went to sauna with our friends and his brother, and when we were leaving we saw that there is a place to play badminton. We decided we have to go next week and I loudly wondered if there is possibility of renting rackets. Then my fiance said it's not a problem as our parents can lend them to us (meaning my parents). His brother made an really weird face, and later he texted me that I manipulate my fiancé and pull him away from his family.  He said I'm the reason he's spending less and less time with them. 

I started to wonder - could this be true? There were moments when we were close to their house and my fiance asked if we can visit for coffee and I was like 'i mean if you really want... but I rather not'. I started to wonder if maybe i really am the driving force for him to distance himself. I am glad he likes my parents that much and that we are spending more time with them then his family. I made efforts for a long time, and it never got better with his family. Maybe AITAH in it all??",2,1756901210.0,AITAH,0,0.75,False
1n7cyyi,https://i.redd.it/66i78huywxmf1.png,Cosmetic Dentistry in Pune: Popular Treatments and Costs,"Cosmetic dentistry has become one of the most sought-after dental specialties in recent years.

* Natural tooth shapes
* Closing gaps or repairing chips
* Restoring confidence in one’s smile

I’m a corporate professional with a calm, well-mannered, gentlemanly approach to relationships. Recently relocated to Pune after a couple of years in the US, where I learned a lot from polycules and couples about what makes multi-partner dynamics healthy and sustainable. I value depth, clarity, kindness, and steady communication.

What I’m seeking

A polyandry or FLR-leaning dynamic with a clear hierarchy: the alpha as the primary partner with the lady, and me as the supportive beta.

I’m also open to other configurations — V, triad, kitchen-table poly, or egalitarian poly — if our values align.

The focus for me is emotional connection, mutual respect, and long-term compatibility, not casual encounters.


How I show up

Beta mindset: low-ego, compersion-forward, happy to be secondary and to uphold the primaries’ bond.

Boundaries and honesty: enthusiastic consent, regular check-ins, transparent expectations, and respect for privacy.

Logistics and stability: reliable with time, good at planning, and happy to contribute to shared logistics and costs where appropriate.

Conflict-light: I communicate clearly, de-escalate gently, and protect the relationship’s center from drama.

Community-minded: comfortable with metamours, group norms, and keeping everyone informed without over-sharing.


A bit about me

Open-minded, emotionally intelligent, and dependable. Outdoorsy, film lover, traveler, and a thoughtful listener. I prefer slow, organic pacing, meeting for coffee first, and aligning on values, boundaries, and hopes before labels. Discretion and health-conscious habits are a given.

If this resonates

DM with your city, current structure, what you’re exploring, and any non-negotiables. I’m happy to start with a simple conversation and see whether our dynamics, pace, and expectations align.

1n7cynt,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1n7cynt/gaggia_magenta_prestige_vs_melitta_barista_t/,Gaggia Magenta Prestige vs. Melitta Barista T F83/0-002 vs. Siemens EQ.6 Plus,"Good morning  
I'm considering buying an automatic espresso machine for +/- 2700 PLN=740 USD (so that family members can use it - the portafilter machine is probably too much learning and  effort for them).  
After searching through stores and reviews, for now my choice revolves around the following: Gaggia Magenta Prestige RI8700 (found on my own), Melitta Barista T F83/0-002 (recommended by seller), Siemens EQ6 plus TE655319RW (apparently it has very little failure), the Nivona brand was also recommended to me.  
Regarding:  
1) Gaggie Magenta Prestige on the Internet (especially in Poland) does not have too many opinions and reviews and according to what I found out from seller it is a solid choice, but you have to keep in mind that the Gaggia brand is not as popular on the Polish market as some others, which translates into lower availability of service and spare parts in the event of a breakdown.  
2) Melitta Barista T F83/0-002 as well as the brand itself was recommended to me by seller and I almost made my decision, but after seeing a video on YT, I was a bit repulsed by the clumsy selection of drinks apart from the basic ones (I also read that milk coffees are not hot enough).  
3) Siemens EQ.6 Plus TE655319RW - typing in google the least faulty coffee machines, it popped up in the ranking first, also in some reviews I found info about its low failure rate and easy operation. However, according to seller, it is a supermarket/mainstream type coffee machine that is not as durable as non-mainstream ones.  
When it comes to the coffee machine, I probably care first about the quality of the machine, so that it is as little failure as possible and, if possible, for years, and in the event of a breakdown, service and spare parts are available.  
  
If possible, please refer to each of the above-mentioned machines, and if you have any other suggestions - I am open to them (I may also consider raising the price ceiling).

Divorce is a warzone, and you've been in the trenches. The shrapnel is flying, and it's easy to spend all your time pointing your finger at the enemy encampment where your ex is holed up. But that's a loser's game. Winning this war isn't about proving them wrong; it's about figuring out how the hell you ended up on this battlefield in the first place so you never have to come back.

This isn't a legal document. It's not about ammunition for your lawyer. It's not for your friends, your mom, or your ex. This is for you. It's an autopsy of a dead relationship, and you were one of the two coroners on duty the whole time. The truth will set you free, but first, it’s going to piss you off. That's how you know you're doing it right.

Grab a pen. Get brutally, gut-wrenchingly honest. No one is watching. No one is judging. Just you and the unvarnished truth.

The Unvarnished Truth: A No-Bullshit Marriage Inventory

INSTRUCTIONS: Find a quiet space. Turn off your phone. Pour a coffee or something stronger. Answer these questions with the kind of honesty that makes your stomach turn. Don't write what you think the answer should be. Write what it is.

Part I: The Blueprint – Who Were You Then?

This is about the ingredients you brought to the table before you even said ""I do.""

 * The Baggage Check: What unresolved shit from your childhood, your family, or previous relationships did you drag into this marriage? Be specific. (e.g., Fear of abandonment? A need to be a rescuer? A belief that conflict is catastrophic? A dysfunctional relationship with money?)

 * The Unspoken Contract: What did you really expect from this marriage that you never actually said out loud? Did you expect your partner to heal you? To make you happy? To fill a void inside you? To be a better parent than yours were?

 * Red Flag Blindness: Looking back with 20/20 vision, what were the red flags you saw in your partner (and in yourself) while dating or engaged that you deliberately ignored? Why did you ignore them? What were you afraid of?

 * The Core Self: Were you a whole, functioning, self-reliant adult when you got married, or were you looking for your ""other half"" to complete you? In what ways were you fundamentally incomplete?
Part II: The Partnership – The Mechanics of ""Us""
This is the nuts and bolts. The daily grind. Marriage is a system; let's look at how your system operated.

 * Communication Breakdown: When you communicated, were you trying to be understood or were you trying to be right? Did you use silence as a weapon? Did you scream to be heard? Did you say what they wanted to hear to avoid a fight (appeasement)?

 * Conflict & Combat: Did you fight fair, or did you fight to win? Did you bring up the past? Use personal attacks (character assassination)? Did you ever truly resolve anything, or just call a ceasefire until the next battle?

 * The Bank & The Boardroom: How did you really treat money? Was it a tool for teamwork, or a source of power and control? Were you honest about your spending? Did you resent your partner's financial habits or contributions? Did you operate as a team or as two competing CEOs?

 * Teammates or Cellmates? Did you have each other's backs, unequivocally, in public and in private? Or did you complain about them to your friends/family? When they were struggling, did you see it as a problem to solve together, or as an annoying burden you had to carry?

 * The Chore War: Forget 50/50. Look at the mental load. Who carried the weight of remembering, planning, and worrying? Did you weaponize incompetence (""I don't know how to do the laundry right"") to get out of your responsibilities? Did you allow resentment over this to build into a silent poison?

Part III: The Connection – The Heart of the Matter
This is about intimacy in all its forms. The stuff that separates a marriage from a business arrangement.

 * Emotional Nudity: How often were you truly, vulnerably, nakedly honest with your partner about your fears, your dreams, your insecurities? And when they tried to be vulnerable with you, how did you react? Did you welcome it, or did it make you uncomfortable and cause you to shut down?

 * Sex & Intimacy: Was sex a connection, a chore, a weapon, or a negotiation? Did you initiate? Did you reject them in a way that preserved their dignity, or in a way that shamed them? Did you communicate your needs, or did you expect them to be a mind-reader? When did the physical touch that wasn't sexual stop (e.g., holding hands, casual hugs)? Who stopped it?

 * The Betrayal Inventory: Betrayal isn't just about cheating. In what ways did you betray your partner's trust? (e.g., A financial secret? An emotional affair? Talking shit about them? Prioritizing your parents/friends over them consistently? Breaking a core promise?)

 * Respect & Contempt: When did the respect die? Pinpoint the moment you started seeing them with contempt—as pathetic, stupid, or beneath you. What did they do to trigger it? More importantly, what unresolved issue in you allowed that contempt to take root and grow?

Part IV: The Collapse – Your Role in the Demolition
This is the endgame. Let's get to the ugly truth of your contribution to the end.

 * The Point of No Return: When did you really check out of the marriage? Not when you moved out, but when you gave up in your heart. What was the final straw that made you flip the switch from ""us"" to ""me""?

 * My Active Sabotage: What specific things did you do that directly harmed the marriage? (e.g., ""I had an affair."" ""I belittled him in front of his friends."" ""I hid a credit card."" ""I refused to go to therapy."") List them. No excuses.

 * My Passive Sabotage: What did you fail to do that suffocated the marriage? (e.g., ""I failed to show appreciation."" ""I failed to stand up for her against my mother."" ""I failed to listen."" ""I failed to choose joy and connection."")

 * The Ultimate Question: If your ex were to write their own brutally honest inventory, what would they say your biggest, most destructive character defect was in the marriage? Be honest. You know the answer.

Now What? The Gold in the Rubble.

You're probably feeling raw. Good. That's the point. The goal of this isn't self-flagellation. It's self-awareness.

 * Identify Your Pattern: Read through your answers. What's the theme? Do you see a pattern of conflict avoidance? A need for control? A fear of intimacy? A tendency to play the victim or the martyr? This pattern is your ""stuff."" It's the one thing you have the power to change.

 * Own Your 50%: A relationship is 100%. You can't control their half, but you can own every damn molecule of yours. Your mission now is to take full, radical responsibility for your part in the breakdown. No more ""I only did X because they did Y."" Just own your X.

 * Write Your New Blueprint: Based on this inventory, what is one core commitment you need to make to yourself for any future relationship (including the one you have with yourself)? For example: ""I will never again use silence as a weapon."" or ""I will learn to state my needs clearly without anger."" or ""I will be a whole person before I join with another.""

This work is the hardest you'll ever do. It's the work that stops the cycle of pain. It's how you ensure that the immense suffering of this divorce becomes a catalyst for your rebirth, not a blueprint for your next failure.

This is your fire. Walk through it. I'll see you on the other side.

I choose how I want my day to look like.

How productive will I be?

Which tasks should I prioritise?

What is the next step?

But one thing remains constant.

It's choosing you every day.

Since I met you, I always choose to spend time with you.

With you, I smile, I laugh, I cry.

With you, I am accepted.

With you, I am myself.

Sometimes I think that you might feel differently about me.

Sometimes I think that the distance might wear you off.

Sometimes I think that I'm putting unneccessary pressuren on you. 

Sometimes, I'm afraid.

Am I good enough despite the distance?

Is my hug something you also crave?

My head is in constant fear, but my heart knows its safe.

Sorry for overthinking.

Sorry for feeling things.

But again, right now, this is an opportunity to choose. 

Do I let anxiety take over or do I trust you when you say...

I'm doing so much already.

I'm more than enough. 

I'm not a burden.

And I believe you. I trust you. You are the best choice. 

You don't just say these things, you make me feel them.

You inspire me to be strong. 

You push me to be better.

You quiet my thoughts and calm my soul. 

My heart is full — it overflows. And I want to give more to you.

No matter how much coffee I drink, panic subsides when you're around. ;)

You left me no choice but to choose you. It's crazy for me not to. 

You're not perfect, so am I. 

But our imperfections bring us closer. 

Thank you for being you.

Thank you for being the easiest choice I make every day.

I [redacted] you, always.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1n7ctrd,https://i.redd.it/o6hk5aozpxmf1.jpeg,BBQ dinner desert safari Dubai - Yatracart,"Dubai is a city that combines luxury, tradition, and adventure, offering travelers unforgettable experiences. Among the most captivating activities is the [BBQ Dinner Desert Safari Dubai](https://yatracart.com/tours/bbq-dinner-desert-safari-dubai), a journey that allows visitors to witness the enchanting Arabian desert, thrilling adventure sports, and an authentic Bedouin lifestyle. At Yatracart, we present an immersive desert safari that blends excitement, cultural immersion, and fine dining under the stars.

Why Choose a BBQ Dinner Desert Safari Dubai?

The desert safari is more than just a tour; it is an extraordinary encounter with Dubai’s natural landscapes and traditions. Away from the city’s skyscrapers and luxurious malls, the desert reveals a serene, golden expanse of sand dunes that stretch endlessly. The BBQ Dinner Desert Safari allows guests to indulge in:

* Thrilling dune bashing in 4x4 vehicles
* Camel rides across the soft sands
* Captivating live performances such as Tanoura dance and belly dancing
* An open-air BBQ buffet dinner with a variety of Arabian and international dishes

This experience is designed to create cherished memories, whether you are a solo traveler, a couple seeking romance, or a family on vacation.

Adventurous Start: Dune Bashing and Sand Sports

The safari begins in the late afternoon when our professional drivers pick you up from your hotel in a comfortable, air-conditioned 4x4 vehicle. As the sun begins to set, the thrill of dune bashing begins. With expert precision, drivers navigate steep slopes and rolling dunes, giving you a heart-pumping adventure.

For adrenaline seekers, the safari also includes sandboarding and quad biking, activities that let you glide or race across the sand for a truly unique desert adventure. Every moment is an opportunity to experience the desert’s raw beauty in its most exciting form.

Capturing the Sunset Over the Desert

One of the most mesmerizing parts of the journey is the desert sunset. The sky transforms into hues of orange, red, and purple as the golden dunes reflect the last rays of daylight. This magical moment is perfect for photography enthusiasts and couples who want to capture a romantic memory. The silence of the desert, combined with the breathtaking view, makes the sunset an unforgettable highlight.

A Glimpse of Bedouin Heritage

The desert safari is not only about adventure but also about immersing yourself in Emirati culture. At the traditional Bedouin-inspired campsite, you are welcomed with Arabic coffee, fresh dates, and local hospitality. The camp is beautifully decorated with carpets, lanterns, and traditional seating arrangements, giving you the chance to relax and enjoy the authentic atmosphere.

Guests can also engage in cultural activities such as:

* Henna painting for women
* Sheesha (hookah) smoking in a lounge setting
* Falconry displays showcasing the UAE’s national bird
* Traditional attire photography, allowing you to dress like a Bedouin or Sheikha for memorable pictures

The Highlight: BBQ Dinner Under the Stars

As night falls, the desert camp comes alive with the aroma of freshly prepared dishes. The lavish BBQ buffet dinner is a true culinary delight, featuring a wide range of choices:

* Grilled meats including lamb kebabs, chicken tikka, and beef skewers
* Vegetarian options like grilled vegetables, salads, and Middle Eastern mezze
* Authentic Arabic flavors such as hummus, tabbouleh, and falafel
* International dishes to cater to every palate
* Delicious desserts like baklava, umm ali, and fresh fruits

Dining under the starlit desert sky with traditional music playing in the background is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The combination of fine food and serene surroundings makes it an unforgettable evening.

Live Entertainment Shows

The BBQ Dinner Desert Safari Dubai also offers captivating performances that showcase the region’s cultural richness. As you enjoy your dinner, artists perform:

* Belly dancing with mesmerizing movements
* Tanoura dance, a traditional Egyptian folk dance with colorful spinning skirts
* Fire shows, a thrilling display of skill and artistry

These performances add a festive spirit to the evening, creating an atmosphere full of joy and wonder.

Stargazing in the Desert

Once the performances are over and the camp settles into calmness, guests can step away from the lights to witness the clear desert sky filled with stars. Far from the city’s light pollution, the desert becomes a natural observatory, making stargazing a magical end to the evening.

I might be the type of person that is craving a connection with somebody, just a little something to ignor the fact that I’m lonely.

Is hard to not fall for somebody, when you’re thinking that everything that he’s offering you is right. 
And I’ve asked him about everything. He want to go out with me just to chat, nothing more. Maybe he’s lonely too. I have problems, he has problems and maybe speaking about them is going to heal us a little bit. 
But I’m going to back off from now. Because I know he’s speaking with another woman that he likes. I’m not going to write him anymore, I’m not going to feel him about my problems and I’m not going to ask him if he want to go out with me again. After seeing all of your comments, I said to him “If you want to meet me after working hours again, you can’t write me a message.

Burning down the house of my four fake lovers,"I am Elena Barron, the sole heiress to a global empire. My father raised four orphans to be my protectors and potential husbands, but my heart belonged to only one: Damien Paul.
But he didn't love me. He loved Luna, an intern he had me sponsor. He promised her that marrying me was just a business deal to secure my inheritance.
To make me more dependent, he orchestrated an accident where a massive chandelier nearly crushed me. My protector was too busy comforting Luna to even notice I was in danger.
The other three men I called brothers sided with them, calling me a vicious, jealous bi**h.
After that brush with death, the love I had for them was gone. I finally gave up.
So at the gala where they planned to humiliate me one last time, broadcasting a secret video of me pining for Damien, I didn't cry.
I smiled.
Because they don't know I have my own surveillance footage, and I'm about to expose every last one of their sordid secrets.

Chapter 1
My name is Elena Barron, and I am the sole heiress to the global dining empire known as the Barron Group. For as long as I can remember, my world has revolved around four young men my father took in. They were talented orphans, prodigies my father groomed to be his right and left hands. One of them was meant to be my husband and his successor.

For years, my heart only beat for one of them: Damien Paul.

He was the most brilliant, the most talented, and the most distant. I spent my youth chasing after him, a shadow clinging to his light. I learned his favorite dishes and made them for him, but he always said he wasn't hungry. I waited for him after his meetings, but he always walked past me with a curt nod. I told myself his coldness was just his nature, a wall he built because of a dark past.

I believed that if I just tried hard enough, I could break through it.

Last night, that belief shattered.

I was bringing an urgent file to Damien, taking the VIP elevator to the top floor of the Barron Group headquarters. The hallway was silent, bathed in the cool glow of the city lights filtering through the floor-to-ceiling windows. That's when I saw them, hidden in the shadows by the executive lounge. Damien had Luna McClain, an intern I was sponsoring, pressed against the wall. He was ki**ing her like his life depended on it, a fiery passion I had only ever dreamed of receiving.

Luna. The girl from a poor background whom Damien had begged me to help, to fund through college with the family's foundation. The girl everyone saw as sweet and fragile. The girl I had treated like my own sister.

Then I heard her wh**per, her voice laced with a fake tremor of fear. ""Damien, what if Miss Barron finds out?""

His answer was a blade that severed my years of devotion. ""She'll never know.""

This morning, I walked into my father' s study and made a decision that would change the course of my life.

""Dad, I've decided who I'm going to marry.""

My father, Mr. Barron, looked up from his papers, a warm smile on his face. ""Have you finally won over Damien? I knew you could do it, sweetheart.""

I shook my head, my voice firm. ""No. I'm accepting Hunter Beach's proposal.""

My father's smile vanished. He put down his pen and looked at me, his brow furrowed with confusion. ""Hunter? The tech mogul from Silicon Valley? Elena, he's not one of my boys. What is this about?""

""He loves me, Dad. Truly.""

""My boys are brilliant. They've been raised alongside you. Javier is a master strategist, Kennith has a fiery passion that could move mountains. Any one of them would be a worthy partner.""

I felt a bitter taste in my mouth. ""Worthy? Dad, you have no idea.""

My mind flashed back to a week ago. After the initial shock of that k**s, I'd fled the corporate tower, ending up in a high-end bar I'd never been to before, trying to drown my sorrow in a cocktail I couldn't even taste. That's when I heard their voices from the adjacent booth. It was Javier Solis, Kennith Boyle, and Leo Vance.

Javier, the cunning one, was speaking in a low voice. ""We need a new strategy. Elena's getting more insistent about Damien. She's not a child anymore.""

Kennith, always hot-tempered, scoffed. ""So what? We just keep playing along. Help Damien keep her happy until he gets what he wants. It's not our problem.""

""It's not that simple,"" Javier replied, his voice calm and sharp. ""We have to make sure our little angel, Luna, doesn't get wronged in all this. Our loyalty is to her.""

A cold dread had filled me as I listened, hidden behind the plush leather of the booth.

They laughed. They laughed at my ""st**id, blind"" devotion to Damien. They talked about how they were all working together, helping him manage me, all to protect their precious Luna.

They even pitied Hunter Beach, the outsider. ""At least he actually loves her,"" Kennith had said with a dismissive shrug. ""Too bad for him he's not part of the family. He's destined to lose.""

Their ultimate goal, the reason for all the deception, was Luna. I remembered the day Damien brought her to me. She was a university student he'd met at a charity lecture, a girl with ""the purest eyes he'd ever seen."" He'd convinced me to use the family foundation to sponsor her entire education. Then, at his suggestion, I'd broken protocol and hired her as an intern in a core department at the Barron Group, paying her double the standard rate.

From the very beginning, his one-in-a-million love story was meant for someone else. I was just the generous ATM, the convenient backdrop for their romance. They were enjoying everything my family provided while secretly mocking and plotting against me.

The memory of Damien's words in that hallway returned, sharp and final. After the k**s, he'd held Luna's face in his hands.

""Marrying her is just about honoring the deal with her father, to get the inheritance,"" he'd promised her. ""You're the one who matters, Luna. You always have been.""

Chapter 2
I spent the entire night in that bar, the cold sting of al**hol doing nothing to numb the fire of betrayal. Damien's words echoed in my head. Honoring the deal. He saw me as a transaction, a bill to be paid.

I would not be his charity case.

With my name and my fortune, I could have any man I wanted. I didn't need to beg for scraps of affection from someone who despised me.

I stood before my father again, my resolve hardened. ""I'm serious, Dad. I'm marrying Hunter. I trust him. He's the only one who has ever been honest with me.""

""But the boys...""

""The 'boys' are loyal to you because you hold their futures in your hands,"" I said, my voice sharp. ""Their deference to me is just an act."" I hid the flicker of pain in my eyes. The years I'd wasted, the love I'd poured out--it all felt like a joke.

I straightened my shoulders. ""I have some requests.""

""Anything, sweetheart.""

""Freeze their corporate accounts and personal credit lines. All four of them. And fire the intern, Luna McClain, for failing to meet hiring standards. Terminate all foundation support for her, effective immediately.""

My father looked shocked but nodded slowly. ""If that's what you want, it's done. I trust your judgment.""

A weight lifted from my ch**t. I walked out of the study, my head held high.

I met Luna on the grand marble staircase in the middle of the corporate headquarters. Dressed in a delicate white dress, she was the very picture of innocence. She rushed over, trying to link her arm with mine.

""Elena! I was just coming to find you! I heard there's a charity gala tonight. Will you take me? Please?""

I looked at her, at the sweet smile she wore, and felt sick to my stomach. This was the face of the girl who had stolen my love and laughed at my pain.

I pulled my arm from her grasp with a look of disgust.

Her eyes widened in surprise. Then, in a move of pure theatrical genius, she let out a small cry and tumbled dramatically down the last few steps of the staircase.

""Luna!"" A frantic shout came from the bottom of the stairs. It was Damien. Kennith and Leo were right behind him.

I looked down and saw them all, standing there, looking up at me.

Kennith Boyle pointed a finger at me, his face red with rage. ""Elena, you vicious bi**h! How could you push her? Your jealousy has made you insane!""

Luna, meanwhile, was already on her feet, rushing to my defense with tears in her eyes. ""No, no, it wasn't Elena! I just slipped. She would never hurt me."" Her words only made me look guiltier.

Her eyes were red-rimmed, her lip trembling. She was the perfect victim.

The men all glared at me with pure disgust.

Damien didn't say a word. He just gave me one cold, dismissive look before scooping Luna into his arms and carrying her away as if she were made of glass.

I was left standing there, alone on the staircase, the target of a dozen pointing fingers and hushed whispers.

Later that evening, at the company's grand anniversary gala, I was a vision in a custom gown, the picture of composure. But she was there, of course. Luna, who should have been fired, was standing by Damien's side as his personal ""assistant.""

She drifted over to me, her voice soft and sweet. ""Elena, I'm so sorry about this morning. And please, don't worry about me and Damien. I know my place. I would never get in the way of your happiness.""

Damien hovered by her side, his eyes never leaving her, as if she were the most precious thing in the world. He adjusted the shawl around her shoulders when she shivered, personally fetched her a glass of champagne. When she complained that her high heels were pinching, he knelt right there on the polished floor, in front of hundreds of guests, to gently examine her ankle.

He knelt for her.

I froze.

My mind flashed back to my thirteenth birthday. The centerpiece of the party was a grand piano, and I had wanted to hear Damien play. He was already a prodigy, his music as brilliant and intense as he was.

My father had taught him that a man should only kneel for his wife.

But that day, my father had looked at a reluctant sixteen-year-old Damien and said, ""Play for her. She is your future, Damien. She is everything.""

Damien had played, his face a mask of silent humiliation. A performance for his future bride, a transaction for his future empire.

Chapter 3
My father's words were meant to be a proclamation, a sealing of Damien's fate and a promise of my own. He was telling him that I was to be his world, the woman he must honor above all others.

I remember the feeling as I sat beside him on the piano bench, my heart hammering in my ch**t. It was the first time I realized I was in love with him.

I was too young, too infatuated, to see the shame burning in his eyes.

I never asked him to play for me in public again. I respected his pride too much.

Now, I watched as he knelt willingly, gladly, for another woman. For Luna. He looked up at her with a tenderness that made my own eyes sting.

The sight was a physical pain, sharp and unbearable. I forced myself to look away.

Just then, Hunter appeared at my side, extending a hand. ""May I have this dance?"" he asked, his eyes ignoring everyone else in the room.

I took his hand and let him lead me to the dance floor. I let myself get lost in the music, in the spin and turn of the waltz, trying to outrun the suffocating reality of my life.

As the final notes of the song faded, a sickening gr**n of stressed metal echoed through the hall. I looked up. The massive crystal chandelier directly above my seat was shuddering, its main support cable snapping like a thread.

It plunged towards me.

The crowd screamed. Time seemed to slow. I saw Damien, his eyes wide, finally reacting, but he was too far away. He had been so focused on comforting Luna, who was feeling ""overwhelmed"" by the party, that he hadn't been paying attention.

It was Hunter who moved like lightning. He tackled me, shoving me clear just as the chandelier crashed to the floor where I had been standing, exploding in a shower of crystal and steel.

Shards of crystal had sliced through my calf. Through a haze of pain, I looked for Damien. He was running towards me now, his face a mask of panic. He was supposed to be my guardian, the one my father trusted to keep me safe.

He had failed. He was too busy doting on her.

The next thing I knew, I was in a hospital bed with a dozen stitches in my leg.

Damien, seemingly wracked with guilt, volunteered to be my caretaker. He was a perfect nurse, attentive and gentle. He brought me my meals, read to me, and made sure I was never in any pain.

For a few days, a foolish part of me allowed a sliver of hope to grow. Maybe he did care. Maybe this accident had made him realize something.

But then I would see the way his eyes lit up whenever Luna visited with a thermos of soup, the secret smiles they shared when they thought I wasn't looking. The hope would wither and die.

One night, unable to sl**p, I hobbled down the quiet, sterile hallway of the private hospital wing. As I passed the fire escape, I heard voices. It was Javier and Damien.

""You went too far this time, Damien,"" Javier's voice was a low hiss. ""She could have been ki**ed. That chandelier weighs a ton.""

My bl**d ran cold. I pressed myself against the wall, my heart pounding in my ears.

Damien's reply was chillingly calm. ""I knew the cable was frayed. I had facilities flag it for repair weeks ago. The plan was for it to slip, to cause a panic. I was supposed to rush in and save her, a little scare to make her more dependent. I never calculated it would actually fall.""

He had calculated my fall. It wasn't an accident. It was a plan.

""So this is your penance?"" Javier asked. ""Playing the devoted caretaker?""

""I'll see it through,"" Damien said. ""Then this will all be over. She'll be fine, and we can move on.""

A wave of nausea washed over me. I felt a coldness spread from my ch**t through my entire body, a chill that had nothing to do with the hospital air conditioning.

He had done this to me. On purpose. To ""scare"" me. To ""manage"" me.

I bit my lip so hard I tasted bl**d, but I didn't feel the pain. The agony in my heart was so much greater, it eclipsed everything else. This wasn't just betrayal. This was monstrous.

Chapter 4
Lying in that sterile white bed, I understood completely. My life, my safety, my very existence was just a pawn in Damien's game to secure his future while placating his lover. The realization was colder and sharper than any piece of shattered crystal.

When I was discharged, Damien was there, waiting to help me into the car. I walked right past his outstretched hand without a word and got into the car with Javier, who had also come along.

Javier, the strategist. The smiling fox. The one who had just reprimanded Damien for almost killing me.

He tried to make small talk on the way back to the Barron Tower, telling jokes, trying to get me to smile.

I couldn't. My face felt like a frozen mask.

""Elena, are you okay?"" he asked, his voice gentle. ""You seem… different.""

""I'm fine,"" I said, my voice flat.

""Look, I know things have been tense,"" he said. ""Why don't we go to the new luxury plaza that just opened? Buy yourself something pretty. It always helps."" He smiled. ""My treat.""

I looked at him, at his handsome, concerned face, and felt a surge of disgust. ""With my father's money?""

He flinched, but recovered quickly. ""I have my own money, Elena. I've made some very successful investments."" He leaned in a little. ""Seriously. Let me buy you anything you want.""

A slow, cold smile spread across my face for the first time in weeks. ""Alright, Javier. You're on.""

If he wanted to play the generous fool, I would let him. I would take everything I could from these vipers.

The Hermès boutique was a quiet temple of wealth and exclusivity. I was examining a limited-edition Birkin when the doors chimed. In walked Damien and Luna.

My smile froze. I had a sick feeling in my stomach. I knew, with absolute certainty, that Luna would want that purse.

She drifted over, her eyes wide with manufactured innocence. ""Oh, that's beautiful,"" she breathed, looking at the bag in my hands. Then she caught my eye and looked down, a hesitant expression on her face. ""Oh, Elena. Do you want it? I'm so sorry, I'll look at something else."" She made a show of stepping back, looking up at Damien with sad eyes. ""I wouldn't want to take something you like.""

She played the part of the magnanimous sister so well.

Javier stepped in, ever the peacemaker. ""Elena, it's just a bag. Why don't you let her have it? I'll buy it for her, just to smooth things over.""

I turned my cold gaze on him, then on her. ""If you want something, Luna,"" I said, my voice clear and cutting, ""you should learn to earn it with your own two hands. And a word of advice: you might want to plan your expenses carefully. As of next month, the foundation will no longer be funding your… lifestyle.""

Luna's face paled. Before she could react, Damien stepped forward. With a look of pure contempt directed at me, he snatched the Birkin from my hands, placed it in Luna's, and pulled out his black card.

""I'll take this,"" he said to the sales associate, his voice a low growl. It was the most direct, public humiliation he could possibly deliver.

Chapter 5
As Damien passed the bag to Luna, I didn't scream. I didn't cry. A glacial calm settled over me, and a small, sharp smile touched my lips. I pulled out my own exclusive, unlimited black card.

""That's a lovely gesture,"" I said, my voice ringing with condescending sweetness. I turned to the stunned store manager. ""The bag that gentleman just purchased for his… companion? Bill it to my account. Also, every other color of this same model that you have in stock--wrap them all up for me.""

The boutique fell silent. Javier stared at me, his mouth slightly agape. Damien's face hardened, his power play utterly deflated by my own, more extravagant one. This was my family's empire. I was reminding him who held the real power.

I handed my card to the manager. He swiped it. A moment later, he returned, his expression deeply apologetic. ""I'm so sorry, Miss Barron. The transaction was declined.""

""That's impossible,"" I said, my voice tight. ""Try it again.""

He did. ""I'm sorry, Miss Barron. The card has been frozen.""

I stared at him in disbelief. I looked at Javier, who immediately stepped forward. ""Don't worry, Elena. I told you, it's my treat."" He handed the manager his own card.

It was also declined.

Javier looked stunned. ""What? My accounts are fine. There must be a mistake.""

A commotion started to build outside the room. People were whispering, laughing.

""Did you hear? The Barrons are broke!""

""She tried to buy out the store and can't even pay for one bag. What a joke.""

My face burned with shame. I had never felt so humiliated in my entire life.

Just then, Damien, who had watched the whole scene unfold with a cool, unreadable expression, walked slowly towards the counter.

""Allow me,"" he said, pulling a card from his wallet. He paid for Luna's bag.

The payment went through instantly.

He turned, looped the bag over Luna's arm, and then looked at me, his eyes cold as ice. ""Perhaps you should learn to manage your finances, Elena.""

I was no longer just a joke. I was the punchline.

I finally understood. This was his checkmate. He was a genius coder, a world-class hacker. He had frozen my accounts, and Javier's, from his phone. This wasn't just about a purse. This was a public execution of my dignity. He had the power to cripple me, and he had just proved it.

He looked at Javier with a low, menacing warning in his eyes, then turned back to me. ""Let's go home, Elena.""

I turned and walked away, not looking back.

For the next three days, I locked myself in my penthouse apartment at the top of the Barron Tower. Javier tried to visit, leaving everything from rare single-origin coffees to first-edition novels outside my door. I ignored them all. I remembered his voice from the bar, laughing about how they'd manipulated me. He was no better than the rest of them.

On the third day, I activated the top-tier security system and pulled up the live feed from the communal living area a few floors below. I'd installed the discreet audio-visual recorders after overhearing them at the bar, needing to know the true extent of their deception.

The Fellows were sprawled on the couches, complaining.

""Is she ever coming out?"" Kennith groaned. ""Luna wants us to take her to the Hamptons, but Damien says we can't go until the princess is 'stable' again.""

""Why is it our job to cheer her up?"" Leo whined. ""Damien's the one who torched her at Hermès. He should clean up his own mess.""

""Damien's orders,"" Javier said with a sigh. ""He wants one of us to go up there and coax her out.""

Just then, Damien himself walked into the frame, holding a small, elegantly wrapped gift box. He looked at the others, his expression dark.

""Elena is my fiancée,"" he said, his voice laced with a cold possession that made my skin crawl. ""Her affairs are none of your business. Stay out of it.""

He headed for the elevator. I quickly shut off the monitor.

Through the door's audio sensor, I heard Kennith's angry voice rise from downstairs. ""His fiancée? Who does he think he is? Mr. Barron said we all had a chance. She belongs to all of us… or to none of us.""

Javier's voice was heavy with resignation. ""It doesn't matter, Ken. In the end, she'll still choose him. She always does. We're just the supporting cast in their twisted play.""

Chapter 6
The lock on my penthouse door clicked open with an electronic whir. Damien stepped inside, using the override access my father had given him, not even bothering to pretend he hadn't just invaded my private space.

""Get out!"" I yelled, my eyes red and swollen from days of rage and grief.

He came closer, placing the gift box on my coffee table. He didn't sit. He stood over me, his voice a low, condescending purr. ""I know you're upset, Elena. But you have to understand. Luna comes from nothing, just like I did. She has a purity that the world hasn't corrupted yet. I have a responsibility to protect that.""

He was asking me to be ""magnanimous,"" to ""tolerate"" her presence in our lives. He promised that once we were married, he would give me all the respect and honor a wife deserves, but that Luna would always be a special case, someone he needed to protect.

I looked up at him, and the last embers of my love turned to ash. He wasn't asking for my permission. He was giving me his terms. He expected me to accept an open rival for his affection and applaud him for his supposed nobility. The hypocrisy was more nauseating than the betrayal itself.

Just then, his phone rang. It was Luna. He answered immediately, his voice softening. ""I'll be right there."" He hung up and stood to leave.

""Don't be difficult, Elena. Be good,"" he said, placing the gift box on my nightstand before he left without another word.

Inside the box was a necklace. A simple, elegant diamond pendant. It was beautiful, but it wasn't a declaration of love.

It was a consolation prize. A leash.

I picked up the box, walked over to the tr**h chute in the wall, and dropped it in without a second thought.

I deserve a man who would give me the world, not one who would ask me to settle for his leftovers.

The evening of the Barron Group's anniversary gala arrived. It was to be the biggest social event of the year, a celebration where my father would officially announce my engagement.

As I was finishing my makeup, my butler entered my dressing room holding a large, beautifully wrapped box.

""This just arrived for you, Miss Barron. From Mr. Beach.""

My heart skipped a beat. Hunter.

I opened the box. Nestled on a bed of black velvet was a breathtaking gown. It was a custom creation from a top international designer, the fabric a deep, midnight blue that shimmered with thousands of tiny, hand-sewn crystals, like a captured galaxy. Alongside it was a set of sapphire and diamond jewelry that mirrored the star-like pattern. A simple card was tucked inside.

""I'm sorry I couldn't get you the bag you wanted at Hermès,"" it read. ""But in my eyes, only the stars and the sea are worthy of you. --Hunter.""

A genuine smile, the first in a long time, blossomed on my face. When I put on the gown and the jewels, I didn't just feel like a princess. I felt like a queen.

As I was about to leave my room, I ran into Eve. She was also dressed for the party, but her eyes were fixed on the sapphires around my neck. Her smile faltered, a flash of raw jealousy in her eyes. She assumed they were from Damien.

""Those are... magnificent,"" she said, her voice tight. ""Did Damien give them to you?""

I brushed past her without a word.

Her face twisted into a mask of pure hatred. ""Don't get too comfortable,"" she hissed at my back. ""He's only marrying you for the Barron Group. I'm the one he truly loves.""

She stepped in front of me, blocking my path, and held up her phone. ""He'll never touch you the way he touches me.""

She pressed play. On the screen, a video began. It was her and Damien, tangled together in his office, their bodies moving in a rhythm of pure lust.

""He's never looked at you like that, has he?"" she taunted, her voice cruel. ""And it's not just him. Kennith, Leo… they all adore me. They'd do anything for me. You're just the tool they're all using to get what they want.""

Chapter 7
The filth pouring from her mouth was more than I could bear.

My hand moved on its own. The sharp crack of my palm connecting with her cheek echoed in the hallway.

""You and your men are disgusting,"" I spat, my voice trembling with rage.

A cold presence behind me made me freeze. I turned slowly and met the icy, furious gaze of Damien. He had seen it all. He didn't say a word, just looked at the red mark on Luna's cheek. And in that silent, glacial stare, I knew he would make me pay.

The entire anniversary gala passed in a blur of anxiety. I smiled, I mingled, I accepted congratulations, but my mind was in a knot of fear. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, for Damien's quiet, calculated revenge.

When my father took the stage to make the official announcement, Hunter, who was seated beside me, reached over and squeezed my hand. ""Don't be afraid,"" he mouthed, his eyes steady and reassuring. ""I'm here.""

My father began his speech, his voice booming through the grand ballroom. ""Tonight, we celebrate not just the legacy of the Barron Group, but its future. It is with immense pride that I announce the engagement of my daughter, Elena, to…""

And then the world exploded.

The giant LED screen behind the stage, which had been displaying the company's logo, flickered and changed. An image of my bedroom appeared. It was me.

I was holding one of Damien's shirts, pressing it to my face, my eyes closed in a state of pathetic, lovesick bliss. The secret recording continued, showing me in my most private moments, whispering his name.

""I love you, Damien,"" my voice echoed through the silent ballroom. ""I love you so much.""

A wave of absolute horror washed over me. I turned, my eyes desperately seeking Damien in the crowd. He stood there, his face a cold, blank mask. He had done this.

Tears streamed down my face. ""How could you?"" I mouthed, my heart shattering into a million pieces. ""How could you be so cruel?""

""Turn it off!"" my father roared, his face purple with rage. ""Somebody turn that d**n thing off!""

But the system was locked. The video kept playing.

Hunter, seeing my devastation, didn't hesitate. He charged towards the control booth at the side of the stage, and with a single, powerful punch, smashed the main console. The screen went black.

The ballroom erupted in chaos. One of my father's business partners rushed to his side. ""Charles, calm down. It's just a young girl's crush. It's clear who she's in love with. Announce the engagement to Damien now! It will smooth everything over.""

My father's face was pale. He knew I had chosen Hunter. He looked torn.

But Hunter didn't give him the chance to decide. He strode onto the stage, wrapping his strong arms around me, shielding me from the prying eyes of the crowd. He held me tight, a solid, unshakeable anchor in my swirling nightmare.

Then he turned to face the stunned guests, his voice ringing with authority and fury.

""Allow me to introduce my fiancée, Elena Barron,"" he announced, his voice booming through the hall. ""As for the coward who released that video, I give you my word: I will find you. And I will make you pay a price far greater than the entire market cap of the Barron Group.""

The crowd gasped.

Across the room, the faces of Damien Paul and the other Fellows were ashen. They stared at me, at Hunter, their expressions a mixture of shock and disbelief. This was not how their plan was supposed to end.

i have the chance to buy an acaso baby t plus used for $1,500 from a bakery owner online. she bought it a year ago, it seems they had sold another of the same machine already six months ago, but for much closer to full price. its being sold without the accessories, “as is”, hasnt been used in months. to me, this is a crazy good deal and yes i promise its not a scam, i identify she owns a cafe not far from me. its about a year old, and lets say not used much or only as a backup machine, how bad of condition could it really be? what should i look out for when i go to see it today? The way I see it, even if I need a second machine for quantity in the near future, this would be good to start with at first, and then I can have two smallish machines on my cart as opposed to a double grouphead to make transport easier.",1,1756900299.0,espresso,1,0.67,False

1n7cmjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductPerspectives/comments/1n7cmjg/explore_if_sprayway_glass_cleaner_really_delivers/,Explore if Sprayway Glass Cleaner Really Delivers a Streak-Free Shine,"Testing and reviewing cleaning products often feels like a mundane task, but my experience with the Sprayway Glass Cleaner Pack of 2 foaming spray cans paired with the microfiber cleaning cloths was surprisingly enjoyable. At first glance, the packaging is simple yet practical, and the promise of a streak-free shine caught my attention. I must say, I was a bit skeptical whether a product specifically marketed for glass would live up to its hype, so I decided to take this cleaning combo for a spin on every reflective surface in my home. From windows to mirrors, even my beloved glass coffee table, I put it to the ultimate test.

**Foaming Action is Surprisingly Fun and Effective**  
Foaming cleaners often have a satisfying visual aspect, and this product delivered in that department. With its rich foam consistency, it clings to the surface rather than immediately dripping away. This turned out to be incredibly helpful when cleaning vertical surfaces like windows and mirrors. I live in an area with hard water, so mineral deposits on glass are a constant battle. To my delight, this cleaner tackled them effectively, without leaving residue or streaks. I was so thrilled by the ease of cleaning that I even tested it on my car windows. The result—a crystal-clear finish that made driving during sunset much safer!  

[Check Sprayway Glass Cleaner price on Amazon.](https://check.sanue.com/p/b0cbqgfdvz/)

**Microfiber Towel Inclusion**  
Though I own several microfiber towels, the bonus ones included in the pack were a welcome addition. Unlike some cheaper cloths that tend to smear, these felt high quality and picked up dirt, dust, and foam exceptionally well. Pairing the towel with the foaming action made cleaning quicker and ensured no lint was left behind.

**Good Points**  
• Foaming action that adheres to surfaces  
• Streak-free results on various types of glass  
• Includes microfiber towels for added value  
• No overpowering or unpleasant smell—the scent is clean and refreshing  

**Areas of Concern**  
• Although effective on glass, it did not perform as well on greasy surfaces like stovetops  
• The cleaner makes surfaces very slick post-cleaning, so extra caution is needed when used on glass tabletops around kids  
• The product size works well for a home with regular cleaning habits but might not last long for commercial needs  

**Competing Products**  
One of the first products that come to mind when thinking of alternatives is Windex. While Windex is undoubtedly a household name with a solid reputation, I noticed it doesn't dry quite as streak-free on my mirrors as Sprayway did. There’s also Invisible Glass, a competitor that markets itself as ammonia-free, but competing products don’t always include handy bonus items like the microfiber cloths arriving with this bundle. In terms of the foaming action, Sprayway felt superior as it clung better to vertical surfaces, reducing waste and making the cleaning job faster.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the Sprayway Glass Cleaner pack comes with not just two cans of high-performing foam spray but also the convenience of high-quality microfiber towels, it feels like exceptional value for the price. You could easily be spending extra buying separate towels or opting for other cleaners that don’t give you the same streak-free shine. While I wouldn’t call it the cheapest cleaning option, the results it delivers certainly justify the slightly higher investment if sparkling glass surfaces are a priority in your household.

But the way you start your day has a profound impact on the rest of it. A morning routine is not a rigid list of tasks; it's a deliberate practice of setting a positive tone and taking control of your day before it takes control of you. You don't need to wake up at 5 a.m. or follow a complex ritual. You just need to be intentional.



# Your Foundational Principles for a Better Morning



**1. Don't Hit the Snooze Button**

The temptation to hit snooze is powerful, but it's a bad habit that harms your sleep quality. Hitting snooze starts a new sleep cycle that you won't complete, leaving you feeling groggy and more tired. Instead, place your alarm clock far from your bed, forcing you to get up. The first step to a productive day is a decisive first action.

**2. Hydrate and Fuel Your Body**

Your body wakes up dehydrated after a night of sleep. Before you reach for coffee, drink a large glass of water to rehydrate and kickstart your metabolism. Next, fuel your body with a healthy breakfast. It doesn't have to be a big meal; a piece of fruit or some yogurt will provide the energy you need to think clearly and focus on the tasks ahead.

**3. Move Your Body**

You don't need a full gym workout to reap the benefits of morning exercise. A few minutes of simple physical activity can wake up your mind and body. Try a quick five-minute stretch, a short walk around the block, or a few push-ups. This gets your blood flowing and helps you feel more awake and energized.

**4. Do Something for Your Mind**

Before you check your phone or your inbox, dedicate a few minutes to an activity that calms and centers you. This could be:

* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and goals for the day.
* **Meditation:** A simple five-minute guided meditation.
* **Reading:** Reading a few pages of a non-work book.
* Thinking: Simply sitting quietly and breathing.This habit allows you to start the day with intention instead of reaction.

**5. Plan Your Day**

Take a few moments to review your to-do list for the day. Prioritize the three most important tasks that you want to accomplish. Having a clear plan of action can reduce stress and ensure you are focused on what truly matters.

A morning routine is a personal practice that can be as long or as short as you need it to be. It's not about being perfect; it's about giving yourself the gift of a calm and prepared start. By taking control of your morning, you set yourself up for a day of success.",1,1756900108.0,u_iwaachghadir,0,1.0,False

Wanted to get some outside eyes on it. I realize it’s a lot packed into a short amount of time, but is it unrealistic? Are there any major red flags I should be aware of? I'm trying to follow decent weather patterns as best as possible. I’m worried parts of it might feel rushed, especially trying to squeeze in the W trek before winter fully sets in.

Hey!!! I’m looking for pals! Mainly a best friend or two! Please be at least 30+, and in the US! 


A bit about me:  I hate the cold 🥶 and I love the sun! I enjoy iced coffees with oat milk in the summer. I love the sea, dogs, and all animals.  I’m into astrology. Ohhh! And I highly dislike anime! 😖 also, don’t msg me asking me why- it’s just not my vibe. 

If you think we’d vibe, hmu! Looking forward to hearing from you! 🤩

1n7ciks,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoardgameDesign/comments/1n7ciks/starting_a_tabletop_game_company_blog_post/,Starting a Tabletop Game Company [Blog Post],"Greetings designers! After stepping away from what I built over 8 years, including more than 10 successful Kickstarter campaigns, I’ve had my ups and downs. But now I’m starting something new, and I’m sharing every step on my blog.

First topic is; **Starting a Tabletop Game Company**

Yes, the time has finally come to announce Feymere. After months of work, here it is: Feymere Games.

I think one of the hardest parts of this whole process was choosing the name and creating the logo. After countless variations and iterations, I am really happy with the decision.

Thanks to my background in advertising and my experience in graphic design, I managed to reach a result I am satisfied with. At least for now. I wanted to do everything right. While trying to make a living and at the same time working on our very first game, it was not easy. First the name, Feymere, then the logo (below), and finally the brand colors. You can also see the first logo below. My very talented friend Voidbrush who is an amazing artist convinced me to use the second logo

For many people, this side of building a strong brand may sound boring. And I cannot blame them. Working on the games themselves is much more fun. So let me tell you about Feymere Games’ first title and why I chose it.

During my nearly decade-long professional tabletop game journey, I met many friends. There was one name, however, that I never had the chance to talk to directly, though I had been following from a distance. Anyone interested in the board game hobby has probably seen him and his games on BGG: Nezih Savı.

Although we lived in the same city, we had never met until recently. We finally decided it was time to change that. Over coffee, our conversation slowly shifted into that familiar publisher-designer talk. Nezih mentioned a game he had developed years ago, one that had actually won an award in a two-player game design contest. It was time to give that game a try.

One day, he and his wife İpek invited me and my wife İzel to their lovely home. That evening, we played the game that you now know as Mournshade. As we played, something became very clear in my mind. There could not be a better starting game for Feymere! Why?

The components are minimal, which means I can handle the production phase more smoothly. The replayability is incredibly high, and the playtime fits perfectly with this. The spark in my mind grew over the following weeks, and Mournshade was born. The cover art is now being illustrated by Murat Çalış, a very talented illustrator and teacher I have collaborated with many times before.

I will dive deeper into the visuals and design details in future blog posts. For now, let us look a little more at the business side of things.

**Is it reasonable to start a new tabletop game publisher in 2025?**

Honestly, I do not know the answer to that question, and I do not think I need to. What I do know is that I have to make games. From a business perspective, maybe none of this makes much sense. If I invested this time and energy into another line of work, I would probably make more money. But I do not care. Creating games and giving people the chance to enjoy them is worth more than any financial reality.

The gray clouds hanging over the industry are not exactly comforting, but clouds pass, the sun comes out, and then more clouds arrive. That is just how the economy works.

I cannot yet predict where Feymere will end up, but one thing is certain. I did not start this company to buy villas with pools or business class tickets. Our mission is simple: designing striking experiences that blend art and play.

With complete openness, I will share Feymere’s journey with you here. If you have questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. This journey is only just beginning.

I am Umut, the captain of Feymere.

Cheers!

I cannot yet predict where Feymere will end up, but one thing is certain. I did not start this company to buy villas with pools or business class tickets. Our mission is simple: designing striking experiences that blend art and play.

With complete openness, I will share Feymere’s journey with you here. If you have questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. This journey is only just beginning.

I am Umut, the captain of Feymere.

Cheers!

This is my first time posting something like this, so not totally sure how to start,  but I guess the easiest way is just to say why I’m here.

I moved to the Netherlands about 6 years ago to study computer science. In my last year I met my girlfriend (we’re still together), and around the same time I started working. Fast forward 3 years since graduating… and I’ve realized I’m actually pretty lonely.

Most of my close friends from uni moved away after graduation, and honestly, I didn’t help the situation much. Back then I put most of my time into work and my relationship, which sped up the process of losing touch with people. I regret that now, but instead of beating myself up over it, I figured it’s better to finally do something about it, so here I am.

I’m looking to make new friends in or around Delft / Amsterdam (I work in Amsterdam). I’d describe myself as pretty extroverted and very chatty once I’m comfortable with people. But when I don’t know anyone in a group, I tend to shut down and get shy, which makes it harder to connect. I’m aware of it and working on it, though!

A little about me:

- I work as a software engineer (Applied Generative AI) and I’m a bit of a geek I guess 

- Super into AI, love following new advancements and building little projects with it

- Love biking and long walks around the city

- Big fan of movies/shows, coffee, and cooking

- Used to be really into building mechanical keyboards

- I enjoy board games a lot (maybe we could check out a board game night together?)

- Don’t game as much anymore, but I used to play a lot of Overwatch, Battlefield, Titanfall, and still keep up with gaming news

- I also really enjoy watching stand-up comedy (though I’ve never been to a live show yet!). Lately I’ve been into Rogier Bak, who often performs in Amsterdam — would be fun to go to one of his shows if you’re into stand-up or his style!

- I love travelling, and one of my goals is to go on a trek around the Eibsee loop in Germany


And so much more, this list is just what I could immediately think of while on the train to work. If your hobbies/interests don’t exactly align, don’t worry, I’m open to trying and exploring new stuff :)

Posting with this one to avoid doxxing myself. 
No real purpose to this post, other than to share some of my views and experience of working towards FIRE in the UK, since most of this sub recently is just random tax and pension questions! I'd love to hear what you guys do and don't do too! 

**Things I do do for FIRE**
1 Focus on earnings first. Some may disagree, but I think with the UK's typically low wages and high taxes and property costs, it is very difficult to get even to leanfire without high earnings, inheritance, or both. Past a certain point, earning more is a much better route to FIRE than spending less. 

2 Cycle or walk almost everywhere. The UK is a mostly flat place with temperate weather for most of the year. I only use car or buses when I have to. 

3 Live in a small flat with relatively few possessions. A small flat has lower maintenance, heating etc costs. Having fewer possessions makes me value the ones I have more. I briefly lived in Tokyo in the past, which put into perspective how spacious some 'small' UK flats actually are. 

4 Selected a partner with broadly similar outlook. She is not FIRE minded specifically, but is careful with money and knowledgeable on pensions and investments.

5 Shun broadcast TV and most social media like instagram. It means I'm not bombarded with adverts to buy crap, or worried about keeping up with my mate from school who just bought a range rover every time I open my phone! 

6 Make the easy substitutions. As an example, Gyms around me are generally £100 per month plus, every single month! Madness. For less than £400 I have a very effective home weights setup, and I can run in the park for free. Forever. 

7 Invest strategically. I know many here are very much 'all-world ETF and chill' . That is still 60%+ of my portfolio, but I like learning about companies and trying to invest for better returns. 

**Things I don't do for FIRE**

1 Eat badly. Life is too short to eat crap food just because it is cheap. I don't go to fancy restaurants often, but I enjoy buying and cooking large portions of good fresh meat and vegetables etc. 

2 Be stingy with friends and family. I may not ask for Christmas presents etc, but I still receive them gratefully and give them readily, and get rounds in the pub with the lads/go for 'nice coffees' with friends etc. 

3 Stoozing, matched betting etc. I just don't think the small benefits are worth the time involved. 

4 Double-jobbing/overemployment. I tried doing two jobs for a while (with main employers permission) and it just led to burnout and high marginal income taxes. 

5 Sweat the small stuff. I just don't think FIRE is won or lost in pennies. Coffees here and there, an £8 a month audible subscription, or switching laundry powders don't really shift the dial much. It's the big things that make the meaningful differences. Things like not buying new cars and latest-gen mobile phones, not buying pointless luxury watches, not having a bigger house than we need, and not getting in the habit of online shopping.

a quick google and various forums told me it's likely the Milk jug/NTC sensor, so I ordered a new one.

While fitting that, I had to pop off the hose on the 3 way valve, when I reattached it part of it broke off as the plastic was mega brittle. I finished the rest of the repairs but noticed I was still getting the same 3 lights flashing.

this made me think there may be a blockage somewhere, I noticed the elbow from the heat exchanger looked pretty grim, it also fell apart when I took it off (more nice brittle plastic).

whilst I wait for a new 3 way and elbow to arrive, can anyone recommend any other places to check for blockages or any other things to consider? The Solenoid valve also looks a bit grim but I'm not sure how easy it is to clean it

For months, every time they smiled at work in Kalyani Nagar, they felt a shadow of embarrassment. Typing *dentist near me* late at night had become a habit, but fear of hearing bad news always stopped them from booking an appointment.

At first, they blamed coffee, tea, maybe even stress. But the truth ran deeper—hidden decay, loose gums, and the quiet worry that they might lose their front tooth. Home remedies didn’t help. Whitening kits failed. Even routine checkups elsewhere left them with quick fixes, not answers. Each mirror glance carried the same weight: *What if I can’t smile freely again?*

One evening, with frustration outweighing fear, they decided to try one last option. They walked into [Jabade Dental](https://share.google/Sm9fXGrZb9zMPkyaI) and met Dr. Jabade. The consultation wasn’t rushed. For the first time, someone explained why the tooth pain lingered, why the stains weren’t just stains, and why ignoring it could mean bigger problems. They spoke about solutions, including **dental implants pune**, in a way that didn’t feel scary—but hopeful.

The treatment wasn’t instant magic. Healing took patience. But slowly, the pain eased, the fear lifted, and the mirror showed something they hadn’t seen in years—a smile that looked like theirs again.

That night, lying in bed, they caught themselves doing something simple yet extraordinary: smiling in the dark, without fear.",1,1756899523.0,GoodDoctorsinPune,0,1.0,False

I got...

* pão com queijo (I meant to say presunto as well but I got nervous and said it wrong :( But still great!)
* café com leite e açúcar

To any other foreigners reading this, I paid at the front of the store counter where the man took my order, and then I took the receipt (ficha) to the food area in the back where they gave me the food. As always, everyone was very patient with me. (I took some Portuguese classes before I came, so I've been able to get by.)

A Day in the Life – Astrodynamics Division (Moonforge Test Engineer)

Jeran Rho - Senior Test Engineer

06:13
Woke up early because gravity cycling glitched and reset the internal clock to some mystery zone. Floated directly into the ceiling. Bit my lip and got a concussion from the breakfast shelf. Moonforge mornings. The auto-brew station refused to dispense coffee because “emotional turbulence detected.” I got chamomile and spite. My Chunks options were Rustberry and something labeled Thermal Lavender. I left both in the sink like a responsible adult.

07:30
Pre-test briefing kicked off with Jasmine Savage’s holo feed flickering like it was thinking too hard. She asked if the “manifestation reports” were still happening. Everyone laughed. Then stopped laughing. Today’s lineup included two linear thruster arrays, a fold-spike engine that technically doesn’t exist yet, and one sealed Highwind crate that read DO NOT OPEN UNTIL THE MOON REMEMBERS. We decided that meant we’d deal with it after lunch.

09:10
First burn test ran hot. Pilot reported it felt like surfing a migraine. Also said her HUD blinked the word “run” during ignition. That’s not in our telemetry packet. Echo, the simulation AI, claimed it was just remembering future input and suggested we meditate on it. Echo wasn’t like this until we hooked it up to the prototype from Windfall. I’ve stopped asking questions. Just logging anomalies and drinking tea that doesn’t judge me.

10:44
Mid-shift crisis. Someone found a message etched into a coolant cylinder: “Steve knows.” Security ran playback. No one entered the lab. No laser cutters logged. No idea how it got there. That’s the third time Steve has been mentioned this week. I didn’t even believe in the cat until I saw the plush toy taped to the fire suppression override with hazard tape. The note just said “He watches now.” I’m going to start sleeping with a wrench.

11:30
ARC pilot SkipTraceur rerouted their training run directly through our primary burn corridor and left graffiti on our diagnostic panel that says “Ducked your plasma arc. Your move.” Everyone applauded. The intern printed it on a sticker. Skip never showed up on station logs. The security team pretended they weren’t impressed. Everyone’s lying.

13:00
Lunch was interrupted when the cafeteria gravity anchors partially disengaged and turned the noodle bar into a floating asteroid belt of soup. Maintenance called it a “spatial flavor experience.” A guy from Structural Fab attached a mat to the ceiling and labeled it Executive Lounge. I’d be mad if it wasn’t so comfortable.

14:25
We tested the Highwind device. Echo refused to initialize. Instead, it played a sound we’ve never heard and stated, “The Reminder is not observing today. Proceed with intent.” The engine pre-fired without input, stabilized our drift before we measured it, and powered down clean. No telemetry. No sound. It blinked a signal back toward Windfall. The pilot said it felt like déjà vu but louder. Marketing already filed a name: Thrustborne.

16:30
Dax came down from the fabrication wing to talk. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days and smelled like reactor lubricant. He said, “It’s getting faster at predicting us.” Then he taped a sticky note to the console that read, “Don’t test tomorrow.” Tomorrow is technically a maintenance window, but Echo flashed the phrase “Bring gloves Jeran ” before I shut the system down. I wasn’t wearing my ID badge. 

Final thought. Moonforge remains the only place in the system where M-class hulls are built, ARC pilots warp through your test bay without warning, and sometimes the coffee machine knows more about you than you do. I love this job. Probably.",2,1756899117.0,amsw,0,1.0,False
1n7ca51,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCSpend/comments/1n7ca51/delve_into_whether_audioengine_a2_desktop/,Delve Into Whether Audioengine A2 Desktop Speakers Are Worth It,"Testing out the Audioengine A2 left me impressed but with a few reservations worth mentioning. These desktop speakers, equipped with 24-bit high-resolution audio and Bluetooth 5.3 APTX-HD connectivity, feel like they’re aimed at people who care deeply about audio quality but also value simplicity in their setup. As someone who spends hours at my desk juggling between music, video editing, and casual gaming, I gave these speakers a real workout over the course of a few weeks.

**Sleek and Compact Design**  
The aesthetic appeal of these speakers is undeniable. Their wooden cabinet construction is not only durable but also visually appealing, with a glossy finish that feels premium. Measuring only six inches deep and wide, they fit snugly on my crowded desk between my monitor and my coffee mug—a feat not many other speakers accomplish without looking clunky. The craftsmanship is evident, particularly in the high-gloss 13-step paint process, though it does tend to attract a bit of dust, which means I’m wiping them down often.

**Impressive Sound Quality and Performance**  
When the sound started flowing out of these speakers, I instantly noticed the clarity. Audioengine claims these are custom-tuned by musicians, and it shows. Whether I was blasting my favorite playlist, listening to podcasts, or diving into the cinematic soundscapes of some intense gaming, the quality was consistently crisp and balanced. The 2.75-inch woofers paired with the 0.75-inch silk dome tweeters make an excellent duo, delivering both warmth and precision without overwhelming bass or piercing trebles. As a fan of bass-heavy tracks, however, I found the speakers needed help in the low-end department unless I hooked them up to a subwoofer via the built-in sub-out port.  

**Easy-to-Use Setup Options**  
Setting up these speakers was a breeze. I alternated between the USB-C and Bluetooth options during my testing phase and appreciated the versatility. The Bluetooth 5.3 worked without a hitch, even retaining a stable connection when I moved over 70 feet away from my desk. The wired options, including the RCA and 3.5mm AUX, were also great, although I stuck mostly to the USB-C for its simplicity and convenience. No drivers to install, no fiddling with extra setup—just plug and play as promised.  

**Check Audioengine A2 price on Amazon.**  

**Upsides**  
- Clear, high-resolution audio for a rich listening experience.  
- Several connectivity options (USB-C, Bluetooth, RCA, AUX) make it versatile for a variety of devices.  
- Compact and stylish design fits easily in small spaces.  
- Subwoofer output allows for bass expansion.  
- Easily connects to smartphones, tablets, and laptops.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Slightly underwhelming bass might not satisfy hardcore bass lovers.  
- High-gloss finish, while classy, is a dust and fingerprint magnet.  
- No waterproofing, making them unsuitable for environments where spills might occur.  

**Competitive Options**  
In a world of desktop speakers, competing brands such as Bose Companion 2 Series III and Creative Pebble Plus offer viable alternatives. Compared to the Pebble Plus, the Audioengine A2 has noticeably better craftsmanship and overall durability. While the Bose option is renowned for delivering excellent audio quality, the Audioengine set edges it out with Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity and high-resolution 24-bit audio, which Bose does not offer at this price point. On the flip side, Bose does bring deeper bass performance straight out of the box, which might make it a better choice for bass lovers unwilling to add a subwoofer.

**Value Proposition**  
Although these aren’t the cheapest speakers you’ll come across, the Audioengine A2 offers an impeccable balance between affordability and high-quality components. Considering their custom-tuning for audio precision, premium materials, and versatile connectivity options, you’re genuinely getting your money’s worth. The 3-year warranty and the dedicated customer care team add additional reassurance for those considering a long-term investment. While there are more budget-friendly options out there, few manage to combine style, substance, and ease of use as seamlessly as this set.

My review:

I got this on July after seeing endless ads on Instagram and positive reviews on insta and their site. 

Got mine delivered on July 1st week and the product was a july batch item. 

First impressions:

It came in a very premium matte rubbery finish box, bottle is also very sturdy. Magnetic cap and a very nice Pressurized atomizer. 

On first sniff, there was an insane amount of alcohol blast, it smelled like alcohol and shoe polish. That smelled stayed for 2 hours, absolutely hated it. No coffee, no chocolate, nothing. 

As it was a super fresh batch, I let it sit for 45 days. 

Current Smell:

Post maceration/maturing it smells like a perfume and not an industrial solution. 

Mind you, there's still that shoe polish smell at the opening but that is due to use of low quality synthetic boozy notes. 

There's a hint of chocolate, bitter coffee and a cakey vibe at the start along with the synthetic booze. 

Then dry down is where it smells good, like a comforting Christmas wine cake drenched in dark chocolate and coffee. 

Sillage smell is identical to a wine cake that they have during Christmas so I guess it's true to its name. 

This will also remind you of bailey's irish cream and kahlua if they had a child with kahlua being dominant. Except its low quality. 

Performance:

Projection: 1 hour soft projection

Longevity is the tricky part, its becomes a skin scent after 1 hour but stays for an entire day on clothes, too bad hardly anyone around you can smell it. 

Layering:

The standalone scent itself is a bit too synthetic for me, so I layer it with vanilla based perfumes but those tend to overpower this one but still works. 

For whom:

This one's unisex, so if you want something that reminds you of Christmas cake (From a bakery no one visits), get this. 

If you want a unique boozy cakey frag for layering get this. 

I feel like women can pull this off as many don't care too much about projection, they just wanna smell delicious, it still lasts all day if you don't sweat. 

In case you sweat a lot, avoid this as after 7 or so hours, it may get animalic on skin. 

Exclusively for cold weather only

Verdict:

6/10, I don't hate the smell but I barely reach out to use it. The low quality blend doesn't work well on its own but layering helps. Maybe it will get better with age as the maturation improvement so far was huge. 

Its still unique but the quality and performance doesn't compete with many players in this price range. 

I would say skip the full bottle and get a custom trial set from them instead (Which is also overpriced). 

They gave 2 x 2ml samples which ironically smelled better than this.

However Im finding myself increasingly grinding coarser and lowering agitation by each cup I brew.

Have you had a similar experience with this bag?

Maybe it is producing more fines than usual being a Ethiopia, washed and higher altitude?

_______

My best recipe has been this:
- grinding at 4.5 with the zp6 (zero being burr lock)
- water at 94 (it drops a degree or 2 with the melodrip)
- melodrip with every pour
- bloom 3x + 2 equal pours 
- finishing before 2:45 (ideally 2:30)
- water 3 drops of Mg, 1 Ca and 3 K (Lotus Water for 450mL)

Honest Review Inside!,"Testing the Taladad B0CRH56P5B Appliance Slider has been quite the rollercoaster of delightful functionality and minor quirks. If you've ever struggled with dragging your coffee maker or toaster from under the cabinet, then you might find this product as intriguing as I did. It's a beautifully crafted 360° rolling bamboo tray designed to ease your kitchen routine, and I couldn't resist trying it out.

**Quality Craftsmanship and Durability**

The first thing I noticed when I pulled the slider out of the box was the high-quality bamboo construction. It felt solid and well-built, yet lightweight enough to maneuver easily. This aspect stood out, especially since I've used similar products that felt flimsy and cheap. Taladad clearly prioritized durability here, and the bamboo tray's strong load-bearing capability is reassuring. After placing a bulky air fryer on top, I was relieved to see that it held up without even a hint of strain.

**Smooth and Effortless Movement**

Equipped with 360° rollers, this appliance slider moves like an absolute dream. Even with a fully loaded coffee maker sitting on it, sliding it back and forth felt almost effortless. I also noticed the rollers didn't leave any marks on my countertop—something I can’t say for similar products I’ve tried in the past. The plastic rollers seem thoughtfully designed to ensure smooth gliding while protecting surfaces from scratches.

**Multifunctionality Across Kitchen Gadgets**

I tested this slider with multiple appliances, including a toaster, a Ninja blender, and even a stand mixer. All fit comfortably within the tray's dimensions of 12.8""W x 15.8""L. It offers ample space for most kitchen gadgets, though I wish it were a tad larger to accommodate some of my bigger appliances. Nevertheless, its compatibility across various gadgets is undoubtedly one of its highlights, especially for kitchens where counter space is a precious commodity.

**Design Aesthetics and Practicality**

Its minimalistic bamboo look adds a natural and stylish element to any kitchen. Pairing function with aesthetics, the slider doesn’t feel like an eyesore when left out. The recessed handles on all sides make it easy to grip and adjust, though I will admit I missed having a locking mechanism for the rollers. On occasions when I was a bit too vigorous, it slid further than I intended, which could be avoided with a simple locking feature.

**Ease of Use**

This might be one of the easiest kitchen accessories I've ever operated. No setup, no assembly—just place your appliance on the tray and you're good to go. It’s perfect if you’re like me and want to skip any tedious installation or fiddling with tools.

**Advantages**

- High-quality bamboo construction offers excellent durability.
- Smooth 360° rollers for easy countertop movement.  
- Versatile size suitable for various appliances, from coffee makers to air fryers.  
- Sleek and stylish design complements modern kitchens.

**Areas of Concern**

- Lacks a locking mechanism for the rollers, causing occasional overshooting.  
- Slightly small for larger appliances like big stand mixers or oversized blenders.  

**Competing Products**

In comparing this product to others, such as the Nifty Coffee Maker Rolling Tray or YouCopia’s kitchen organizers, Taladad’s bamboo design feels much sturdier. The competitors often feature plastic builds, which lack the elegant look and robust feel of bamboo. However, those other trays sometimes include features like embedded braking mechanisms or deeper grooves for stability, which this slider lacks. It's a trade-off—natural aesthetic versus more gadget-like functionality—so the choice ultimately depends on personal preferences.

**Value for Money**

For what it offers, this appliance slider seems like a well-justified investment. It doesn't try to do more than what it promises but delivers brilliantly within its scope. Compared to alternative products available in this range, it balances quality and practicality exceptionally well. It's rare to find something that elevates everyday kitchen tasks so seamlessly while maintaining visual appeal.

It is not with the intention of getting back together but as a way of me saying how much she meant to me and what she did for me, honest and brutal feedback appreciated!

Hey Etty,

I don’t expect you to want to read this or ask you to respond. This is not a guilt trip either. This has taken me a good few times to think through but I wanted to do this regardless.

What I felt for you was so genuine that I thought it couldn’t be real. The way you looked at me, made me feel seen and remembered every detail. I will always remember our first date. How you spilled coffee on your coat, that we chatted for hours about anything and everything and saw from that I didn’t want to see anyone else. What I will remember forever was that you remembered every comment, every little part of the conversation and every gesture.

I will always cherish the times we had together regardless of if we ever see each other again as you genuinely taught me that I could love again. That has been something that I did believe was possible for a long time. Maybe we were meant to be in each other’s lives for moment to show something to ourselves but I believe our connection was more than that.

Your cute smile, the way we could sit and say nothing and the the way you would stare at me with those beautiful eyes and go ‘hmmm’ you would give me while looking at me made me melt. How we could be complete idiots around each other, laugh all the time or just sit there is silence around one another. I will now have to miss sat on the sofa while scratching the back of your head and seeing you at peace.

How you found it hilarious how I tripped over everything, squinted to see or just being a complete idiot. I never did this to please you, I am just a bumbling idiot and having you see me for who I truly am was so heart warming it was unbelievable.

I look back on all our dates individually and I cherish every single one of them. The laughs, the jokes and the I loved your company so let’s stick around, how 1 night turned into 2 days. I could have not asked for anything more from the 4 months we had.

I loved caring for you and that is all I ever wanted to do, I guess I just wanted reciprocating feeling, and to feel like I was heard, to feel like it wasn’t something I had to do but something you wanted to do with me. I am assuming you are still smashing Thursday pitch meetings and looking forward to your AP role in April!

I don’t believe anyone is perfect. But I do believe that people can be imperfectly perfect in people’s eyes. To me you were exactly that, everything I wanted and everything I needed. Always something to work on, but the basis of our relationship was something we both craved and lusted for, the basis of constant communication, friendship, idiocy, silliness and wanting. The need for attention from each other that we both craved, the endless nights and the stupid conversations. The way we often knew what hurt the other and fixed it before it was an issue, what we had to work on was what we didn’t see, to me that is so profound in a relationship, no one can ever know how to love someone exactly. They need teaching and coaching as to what the other needs, especially later on in life when we all have to deal with baggage.

Call me a hopeless romantic but all I wanted to was to tackle that all with you. I hope I showed you through my actions how much I cared and wanted the best for you, all I wanted was to give you peace and serenity where it wasn’t before. Provide you with a safe space to be yourself, thrive and be the best you, you can be is all I ever wanted. Let you know everything single day that you were and are amazing.

I am sorry I got angry, I am not happy about my behaviour in the slightest and I fully apologise for that because it affected the person I cared about so much and I have to own that.

You are probably going to ask why I am doing this, it is not to get you come back but a somewhat closure for me of the impact you had on my life. I am not writing this in the hopes of redemption as we have both said and done a lot. I think it is a way of giving me peace to let you know what you meant to me regardless of what you feel about me. This isn’t meant to erase or disregard anything that was said or happened.

1n7bwdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_One_Scallion_6415/comments/1n7bwdr/top_8_hotel_table_furniture_manufacturers_in_india/,Top 8 Hotel Table Furniture Manufacturers in India,"When you step into a hotel, the furniture is one of the first things you notice. Tables in particular hold a special place—they aren’t just functional, they set the tone for the entire dining or lounging experience. A well-crafted hotel table can leave a lasting impression on guests, blending comfort, design, and durability. India has a growing industry of furniture manufacturers dedicated to the hospitality sector. Some are well-established, while others quietly serve niche markets with unique styles and craftsmanship.

Here’s a look at **eight manufacturers in India making their mark in hotel table furniture**, starting with one of the best-known names and followed by smaller but equally interesting players.

# 1. Best of Exports – A Benchmark in Hospitality Furniture

Among all [hotel table](https://bestofexports.com/hotel-furniture/hotel-table/) manufacturers in India, **Best of Exports** stands tall as one of the most reliable and admired names. They’ve built a strong reputation over the years for supplying furniture that doesn’t just look good but also performs well under the heavy usage common in hotels, cafés, and restaurants.

The first thing that sets them apart is quality. Their tables are built using carefully chosen materials—solid wood, metals, and durable finishes—that can withstand constant use without losing charm. Hospitality spaces see a lot of footfall, and Best of Exports ensures their products can handle this. The durability of their furniture is a big reason why they’re trusted by hotels ranging from boutique stays to large resorts.

Another strength is their ability to balance style with practicality. Hotels today look for designs that enhance interiors while staying functional. Best of Exports caters to this by offering modern, classic, and even custom-made table designs. From sleek dining tables for restaurants to coffee tables for lobbies, they cover a wide range of needs. Their flexibility with customization also makes them a favorite among interior designers and architects who want unique furniture solutions.

Pricing is another area where they shine. They manage to deliver affordability without cutting corners. This has made them popular among small businesses like cafés and mid-range hotels that need stylish yet budget-friendly solutions. At the same time, they can scale up to deliver large projects for luxury properties, proving their versatility.

What also makes them stand out is their professionalism and timely deliveries. In the hospitality industry, delays can affect entire projects. Best of Exports has systems in place to ensure that furniture reaches clients on schedule, making them a dependable partner.

Their experience in the industry also gives them a strong edge. With years of working with hotels and restaurants, they understand the changing needs of the market. They don’t just manufacture tables; they provide guidance on what works best in different hospitality setups. This consultative approach has made them more than just a furniture supplier—they’re seen as collaborators in creating spaces that guests remember.

In short, Best of Exports has become a benchmark for hotel furniture manufacturing in India. With their combination of quality, design, affordability, and reliability, they’ve set a high standard for others in the industry.

# 2. Shree Swastik Furniture

Shree Swastik Furniture is a name that has built a strong following despite having limited online visibility. They focus on practical, sturdy, and stylish tables that suit mid-range hotels and restaurants. Their ability to produce in bulk makes them a good option for hotel chains looking for consistent quality across multiple locations. Many customers value them for their reliability and the balance they strike between cost and durability.

# 3. Sankheda Furniture

Sankheda Furniture is rooted in traditional Indian craftsmanship. Their tables are instantly recognizable for their bright, hand-painted designs that originate from Gujarat. The artistry involves painting teak wood with intricate foil and lacquer finishes, making each piece stand out as both functional and decorative. These tables are often found in boutique hotels or heritage resorts that want to showcase Indian culture through their interiors. While they may not dominate digital spaces, their furniture has timeless appeal and cultural richness.

# 4. Varsha Kitchen

Varsha Kitchen is better known for its commercial kitchen equipment, but they also manufacture tables for hotels, canteens, and cafeterias. Their focus is on function and durability. The tables they produce are designed to handle high usage in dining halls and staff areas, where practicality matters most. While their designs may be simpler compared to boutique furniture makers, they fill an important role in supplying the backbone furniture for hospitality setups.

# 5. Ampre Hospitality

# USGS draft elevates criticality of niobium, dysprosium, terbium found at Nebraska project.

With the U.S. government elevating niobium, dysprosium, and terbium to the highest urgency tier on the federal critical minerals list, NioCorp Developments Ltd.'s Elk Creek project stands as a prospective domestic source of these minerals now classified among the most critical to national security and supply.

Critical minerals underpin technologies ranging from advanced defense systems to clean energy infrastructure, yet U.S. supply of many of these materials remains reliant on foreign sources often concentrated in single nations.

To address these vulnerabilities, the federal government maintains a critical minerals list that informs investment priorities, guides permitting decisions, and supports efforts to build out secure domestic supply chains.

In a 2025 draft update issued by the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey, niobium, dysprosium, and terbium were elevated into the highest urgency tier of the federal critical minerals list, a ranking that reflects both their limited global availability and the potential economic consequences of supply disruption.

""The draft 2025 list and methodology reflect USGS advances in forecasting potential mineral supply chain disruptions, as called for in the Energy Act of 2020,"" said Sarah Ryker, acting director of the USGS.

In its analysis, the U.S. government determined that a complete loss of imported niobium would cause the second-largest decrease in gross domestic product of any of the 54 designated critical minerals.

Even on a probability-weighted basis that accounts for likelihood of disruption, niobium ranks ninth for potential GDP impact, emphasizing the vulnerability of relying entirely on foreign supply.

""The U.S. is 100% dependent on niobium imports, and principally from only one nation: Brazil,"" said NioCorp Developments CEO Mark Smith. ""NioCorp's Elk Creek Project will address this vulnerability by initiating the first-ever mining and processing of niobium in the U.S.""

Found roughly 80 miles south of Omaha in southeastern Nebraska, Elk Creek is among the only U.S. deposits containing niobium, dysprosium, and terbium, positioning the project as a consolidated source of these critical minerals.

According to an S-K 1300-compliant assessment, the project hosts more than 970,000 metric tons of niobium oxide and 632,900 metric tons of total rare earth oxides that include dysprosium and terbium.

As the project advances toward development, NioCorp has framed Elk Creek's resource in the context of growing federal concern over supply vulnerabilities.

""As a pure-play critical minerals project with all of our minerals designated as vital to the U.S., we are proud to represent what we believe is one of the most strategic polymetallic critical minerals projects in America,"" said Smith. ""Moreover, the government now says that three of our minerals are among the most critical of all critical minerals. This further demonstrates the urgency of getting the Elk Creek Project into construction and commercial operation as rapidly as possible.""

# SEPT. 3rd, 2025~Efforts to Diversify Critical Minerals Supply Chains Falter

[Efforts to Diversify Critical Minerals Supply Chains Falter | The Regulatory Review](https://www.theregreview.org/2025/09/03/flatley-efforts-to-diversify-critical-minerals-supply-chains-falter/)

https://preview.redd.it/ucam7y3e7xmf1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c461ad6b14ce147668fc5d3ea5bb373793b3914

The global demand for [critical minerals](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024/outlook-for-key-minerals), such as lithium and cobalt, continues to [rise](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024) as countries [pursue](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024/executive-summary) ambitious clean energy goals. Yet, international efforts to diversify supply chains have struggled to [reduce](https://www.csis.org/analysis/minerals-security-partnership-under-south-korean-leadership) U.S. dependence on dominant suppliers, including China. For the United States, this reliance [creates](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/international-energy-agency-critical-mineral-market-review-2023-supply-challenges/687540/) vulnerabilities in accessing the materials essential for energy security and technological innovation.

Previously, including during the Biden Administration, the United States [took](https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/critical-cooperation-how-australia-canada-and-united-states-are-working) initiatives to address this issue, such as regulating the international supply chain of critical minerals. These efforts, however, have not led to new supply chains of critical minerals for the United States.

Demand for the critical minerals needed for clean energy applications is growing. The International Energy Agency [reports](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024/executive-summary) that “if countries fully implement the national energy and climate pledges they have announced, mineral demand for clean energy technologies would more than double by 2030 and triple by 2040, reaching nearly 35 million tonnes annually.”

Critical minerals are not produced in significant amounts within the United States. Kate Magill, lead editor at [*Utility Dive*](https://www.utilitydive.com/), a utility industry, [comments](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/international-energy-agency-critical-mineral-market-review-2023-supply-challenges/687540/) that the United States may face supply chain issues because of its reliance on supplies of critical minerals from overseas.

Two years ago, Australia and the United States endorsed a non-binding [compact](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/20/australia-united-states-statement-of-intent-climate-critical-minerals-and-the-clean-energy-transformation/). In a joint statement, the two governments [described](https://www.pm.gov.au/media/australia-united-states-climate-critical-minerals-and-clean-energy-transformation-compact) the non-binding compact as a “framework” for focusing bilateral cooperation on climate initiatives and clean energy. The compact was aimed at [creating](https://www.pm.gov.au/media/australia-united-states-climate-critical-minerals-and-clean-energy-transformation-compact) a clean energy supply chain, but results remain unclear. Although a joint statement by Australia and the United States [describes](https://www.energy.gov/articles/joint-statement-between-us-and-australia-2024-ministerial-dialogue-clean-energy) projects that have begun under this compact, noting that both countries remain committed to the cooperative effort, the practical consequences of the compact to create a new “end-to-end” supply chain are not yet evident.

The United States and the European Union also began negotiations to reach a critical minerals agreement around the same time. These efforts largely [stalled](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12145) after about a year of negotiations, as the U.S. government [seeks](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12145) to address congressional concerns on an agreement. Analysts at the [Library of Congress’s Congressional Research Services](https://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/about/) have noted that Congress may wish to consider whether to avoid such an agreement because it may prevent either the United States or the European Union from making more ambitious commitments elsewhere. The United States has [not continued](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12145) with these negotiations.

Three years ago, the United States [announced](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership) a large plurilateral partnership with 23 countries to accelerate the development of sustainable clean energy supply chains and encourage “responsible” production of critical minerals. South Korea [became](https://www.csis.org/analysis/minerals-security-partnership-under-south-korean-leadership) the chair of this partnership last year and, as chair, the country is focusing on “de-risking” supply chains. Although commentators [see](https://www.csis.org/analysis/minerals-security-partnership-under-south-korean-leadership) the opportunities of the partnership, it has not yet led to significant developments in alternative critical mineral supply chains for the United States.

Policymakers seem to agree that steps need to be taken to address the shortage and lack of diversification in the supply chain. Despite U.S. [legislative](https://www.irs.gov/inflation-reduction-act-of-2022) efforts to encourage battery and automakers to source raw materials from countries other than such as China, critical minerals supply worldwide remains [controlled](https://www.csis.org/analysis/minerals-security-partnership-under-south-korean-leadership) by a select few countries.

As global efforts have faltered, the United States has shifted its focus inward, prioritizing domestic production under a recent [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/) issued by President Donald J. Trump. The executive order [states](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/) that the United States should use its vast supplies of minerals to create jobs and to reduce its reliance on “foreign nations.” The executive order does not address clean energy applications for critical minerals, but it is consistent with concerns about diversifying supply chain access to critical minerals. The order describes the domestic [production](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/) of critical minerals as a “national security” imperative. The purpose of the executive order, as [described](https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-trumps-new-critical-minerals-executive-order) by [Gracelin Baskaran](https://www.csis.org/people/gracelin-baskaran) and [Meredith Schwartz](https://www.csis.org/people/meredith-schwartz) at the [Center for Strategic & International Studies](https://www.csis.org/), is to send a “strong signal” to the private sector that President Trump is focused on domestic critical mineral production

[Sydney Hudson](https://www.dailysignal.com/author/sydney-hudson/) and [Wilson Beaver](https://www.heritage.org/staff/wilson-beaver) at [The Heritage Foundation](https://www.heritage.org/) [comment](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/securing-critical-mineral-supply-chains-defense-priority) that the United States is “almost fully reliant” on imports of critical minerals, arguing that American “protectionism” is the solution to these concerns.

Looking forward, the [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/) [reports](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024/executive-summary) that the demand for critical minerals will increase as countries around the world [seek](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024/executive-summary) to meet their climate pledges. Even if the Trump Administration opts to [withdraw](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-america-first-in-international-environmental-agreements/) from its international environmental and clean energy commitments, the demand for clean energy technologies will likely [increase](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2024) in the future, [driven](https://unu.edu/merit/article/trumps-effect-critical-minerals-could-be-crucial-future-green-energy) by markets in China and Europe, resulting in a continuing increase in demand for critical minerals. If the United States wishes to further diversify its supply chains for these minerals, it will need to continue to consider the possibility of international cooperation, as the [Center for Strategic & International Studies](https://www.csis.org/) [explains](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trade-critical-supply-chains).

**VANCOUVER, BC /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ September 3, 2025 /** Apex Critical Metals Corp. (""Apex"" or the ""Company"") (CSE:APXC)(OTCQX:APXCF)(FWB:KL9), a Canadian mineral exploration company focused on strategic metals vital to global supply chains, is pleased to provide an update on a corporate initiative to expand its holdings within the U.S.A. as part of a broader positioning within the North American critical minerals sector.

The Company, via a local agent, has acquired rights to explore and options to purchase a **2,407-acre** midwestern U.S.-based property package it considers highly prospective for rare earth elements (REE) and critical mineral mineralization based on a historic exploration data set available to the Company. >>>>***The project covers a large portion of a rare metal complex which has been known for more than 50 years but remains largely underexplored. Dahrouge Geological Consulting Ltd. (""Dahrouge"") has been retained to review the historical exploration data and provide recommendations going forward.<<<***

[NOTE: PURCHASING A U.S. yet Un-named Site. A Carbonatite Known for over 50 years & Keyed in on \\""NIOBIUM & Rare Earths\\"" is Interesting! as Diversity of supply is needed.](https://preview.redd.it/mmgg84by8xmf1.png?width=465&format=png&auto=webp&s=3996376b0fc38dc78f9638737e648cd6966618f3)

**CEO of Apex Critical Metals, Sean Charland, states:** ***""I've personally worked with Jody Dahrouge and his team for more than two decades, with several years spent evaluating rare earth element exploration opportunities. Over the past year, in addition to our collaborations in Canada (Cap Project), we've focused our efforts on a particular district in the US that we believe holds significant potential for rare earth and niobium discoveries. The recent shifting of government priorities and industrial demand forecasts aligns well with the highly prospective portfolio we are building at Apex.""***

The property package to-date totals 2,407 acres, and the Company acquired the rights to explore, as well as an option to purchase the mineral interest in respect of the properties, or an aggregate purchase price of CAD $567,472.84. The Company shall have the option to purchase the mineral interest in respect of the properties by paying the sum of US$10,000 per acre. If the option is exercised by the Company, an aggregate 2.5% net smelter return (""NSR"") royalty is payable, with Apex retaining the right to repurchase 0.25% of the NSR for US$500,000.

**Rare Earth Supply Chain Dynamics**  
This acquisition comes at a time of unprecedented investment in U.S. rare earths. On **July 10, 2025**, the U.S. Department of Defense announced a **US$400 million equity stake in MP Materials Corp.**¹, operator of the Mountain Pass mine, in a deal that also included a decade-long guaranteed pricing arrangement for permanent magnets used in defense applications. Just days later, **Apple Inc.** signed a **US$500 million multi-year supply agreement** with MP Materials, marking one of the largest corporate commitments to a U.S.-based rare earth producer in history.

The urgency is reinforced by the **U.S. Geological Survey's 2025 Mineral Commodity Summaries**, which note that the U.S. is 100% import-dependent for 12 critical minerals, including rare earths and niobium.^(2) In 2024, U.S. consumption of rare earths was approximately 8,800 metric tons REO (Rare Earth Oxides) equivalent, while domestic mine production at Mountain Pass was \~43,000 tons, almost all shipped to China for refining. For niobium, more than 90% of global supply comes from Brazil, with the U.S. having no domestic production.^(3) Apex's move into the U.S. market is aligned with government priorities to reduce reliance on foreign sources of these essential inputs.

Governments across the allied world are reshaping policy to meet these challenges. In Canada, Prime Minister Mark Carney has proposed that investments in critical minerals development be counted toward NATO defense commitments - a framework that could channel billions into mining and processing as part of national security obligations.⁴ In the United States, the Department of Defense has already backed MP Materials and Lynas Rare Earths' Texas processing facility, with analysts expecting further Defense Production Act funding to be deployed in the coming months.^(5,6) Meanwhile, China has extended its production quota system to imported rare earth concentrates, a move that could create new bottlenecks for global supply.^(7) Together, these shifts highlight both the risks of foreign dependence and the opportunity for companies like Apex to play a meaningful role in building secure supply chains across North America.

The Company also notes increased validation from peer activity. Earlier this year, Critical Metals Corp. secured a 10-year offtake agreement with Greenland's Tanbreez project, ensuring future REE feed for allied markets.^(8) Energy Fuels Inc. recently produced the first kilogram of 99.9% pure dysprosium oxide ever refined in the U.S., a milestone for heavy rare earth separation outside of Asia.^(9)

With assets spanning British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, and now the United States, Apex is establishing itself as a continental critical minerals company. The Company's portfolio is built around carbonatite systems; the same rock type hosting such world-class deposits as Araxá in Brazil, Bayan Obo in China, Niobec in Canada, and Mountain Pass in the USA. Apex will provide further updates as the Company finalizes its property acquisitions and exploration progresses.

[Given the Midwest region and the known carbonatite signature, Apex’s target is likely in one of these geologically analogous zones—though not Elk Creek \(that’s NioCorp’s exclusive base\).](https://preview.redd.it/qj3o6d9zlxmf1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9cc7e71aec8b4704a782637cb38aafb26329707)

With the U.S. government elevating niobium, dysprosium, and terbium to the highest urgency tier on the federal critical minerals list, NioCorp Developments Ltd.'s Elk Creek project stands as a prospective domestic source of these minerals now classified among the most critical to national security and supply.

Critical minerals underpin technologies ranging from advanced defense systems to clean energy infrastructure, yet U.S. supply of many of these materials remains reliant on foreign sources often concentrated in single nations.

To address these vulnerabilities, the federal government maintains a critical minerals list that informs investment priorities, guides permitting decisions, and supports efforts to build out secure domestic supply chains.

In a 2025 draft update issued by the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey, niobium, dysprosium, and terbium were elevated into the highest urgency tier of the federal critical minerals list, a ranking that reflects both their limited global availability and the potential economic consequences of supply disruption.

""The draft 2025 list and methodology reflect USGS advances in forecasting potential mineral supply chain disruptions, as called for in the Energy Act of 2020,"" said Sarah Ryker, acting director of the USGS.

In its analysis, the U.S. government determined that a complete loss of imported niobium would cause the second-largest decrease in gross domestic product of any of the 54 designated critical minerals.

Even on a probability-weighted basis that accounts for likelihood of disruption, niobium ranks ninth for potential GDP impact, emphasizing the vulnerability of relying entirely on foreign supply.

""The U.S. is 100% dependent on niobium imports, and principally from only one nation: Brazil,"" said NioCorp Developments CEO Mark Smith. ""NioCorp's Elk Creek Project will address this vulnerability by initiating the first-ever mining and processing of niobium in the U.S.""

Found roughly 80 miles south of Omaha in southeastern Nebraska, Elk Creek is among the only U.S. deposits containing niobium, dysprosium, and terbium, positioning the project as a consolidated source of these critical minerals.

According to an S-K 1300-compliant assessment, the project hosts more than 970,000 metric tons of niobium oxide and 632,900 metric tons of total rare earth oxides that include dysprosium and terbium.

As the project advances toward development, NioCorp has framed Elk Creek's resource in the context of growing federal concern over supply vulnerabilities.

""As a pure-play critical minerals project with all of our minerals designated as vital to the U.S., we are proud to represent what we believe is one of the most strategic polymetallic critical minerals projects in America,"" said Smith. ""Moreover, the government now says that three of our minerals are among the most critical of all critical minerals. This further demonstrates the urgency of getting the Elk Creek Project into construction and commercial operation as rapidly as possible.""

# What This Means Strategically

1. **Echoing NioCorp’s Playbook**
   * Both companies are doubling down on **rare-earth-bearing carbonatite systems** in U.S. strategic context. Sharing a geological consultant (Dahrouge) further suggests parallel approaches in leveraging these terrains.
2. **Apex’s Strategic Fit**
   * Right in the bullseye of the DOE’s push for domestic REE + critical mineral resource expansion. Especially timely given the $1B+ DOE initiative and DoD / EXIM buzz.
3. **Geological Rarity & Policy Alignment**
   * Carbonatites with economically viable REEs and niobium are rare in the U.S.—and midwestern complexes meeting Apex's description are notably scarce.
   * This move gives Apex a direct flank advantage as Washington’s infrastructure and defense policies accelerate domestic supply chain development.

# Bottom Line for Niocorp Watch

# ***Apex’s acquisition isn’t a threat—it underscores a broader strategic convergence. Investors and policy makers are recognizing the Midwest’s carbonatite belts as U.S. critical mineral reservoirs. That only raises the profile—and urgency—around Elk Creek's drill results, DFS upgrade, and processing plans.

# ****As these maps and plays align, NioCorp's mine-to-manufacturing vertical integration strategy stands out even more!

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

Let’s break down how their project footprint stacks up — and why **Elk Creek** is now positioned among the most *vertically integrated, multi-commodity critical mineral projects* in North America.

# 🔥 NioCorp Critical Minerals Advantage – Updated with 2025 DOI Ranking

|**Neodymium/Praseodymium**|Yes|NdFeB magnets, key for EV motors|Future by-product (vertically aligned potential)|

# 💡 NioCorp Strategic Integrations & Verticals

**1. Project PIVOT – Scandium-Aluminum Alloy Production**

* Niocorp aims to **commercialize Sc-Al alloys**, a key lightweight metal for aerospace, automotive, and defense.
* This would create a **value-added downstream vertical** beyond simply mining scandium.
* It aligns perfectly with **DoD lightweighting** and **EV chassis innovation** efforts.

**2. Magnet Materials Value Chain – Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb**

* The company has long stated its aim to include **REE separation** into the development plan.
* This ties into potential **public-private partnerships or off-take deals** tied to CHIPS, SMR, DoD or DOE critical minerals policies.

**3. TiCl₄ (Titanium Tetrachloride)**

* Unlike raw ilmenite or rutile, **TiCl₄ is a downstream precursor** for titanium metal or pigments, useful in aerospace, solar, defense.
* This level of processing opens up **EXIM or DOE financing channels** because it reduces reliance on Chinese-sourced intermediates.

# 🚨 Why This Matters Now

# ✅ Elk Creek is unique in its ability to:

* Supply **multiple top-tier critical minerals** (3 in today’s Top 10).
* Deliver **downstream, value-added products** (Sc-Al alloys, TiCl₄, REE concentrates).
* Be **shovel-ready** with permits, FS, and site control.
* Attract **DoD, DOE, and EXIM funding**, especially in the current 2025–2026 infrastructure and national security cycles.

# 🧠 Big Picture: NioCorp's National Strategic Role

|Capability|Federal Alignment|Advantage|

**IMHO**\~ *NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project is entering its most pivotal phase yet, with Phase 1 drilling complete, an updated resource estimate on deck, and a Q4 2025 Definitive Feasibility Study expected to showcase expanded output across scandium, niobium, titanium, and rare earths. The company’s recent addition of Ernest Cleave to lead business development and financing underscores its readiness to transition from development to execution, including* ***full vertical integration of scandium-aluminum alloys*** *— fueling its reputation as the “Saudi Arabia of Scandium.”*

*Backed by strong U.S. government alignment — including a $10M DoD Title III grant, ongoing EXIM Bank financing engagement, and clear inclusion in national defense and supply chain mandates — Elk Creek is positioned as one of America’s most strategically significant critical minerals projects. Policy tailwinds from DOE’s $1B critical minerals program, the CHIPS Act, and DPA/SMR hubs further reinforce the urgency to secure domestic sources of these materials, with scandium’s lightweighting potential drawing particular interest from defense and aerospace leaders.*

*With drill results expected in the near term, a live RedChip webinar set for September 11th, 2025, and potential offtake and financing agreements in play, NioCorp sits on the cusp of a major re-rating. As the only U.S. project capable of delivering* ***Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and rare earths at scale*** *— and uniquely poised to dominate scandium-aluminum alloys — Elk Creek could redefine American resource independence by 2028 and beyond, cementing NioCorp as the flagship U.S. critical minerals solution!*

# — and it’s clear: NioCorp isn’t just about magnets. It’s part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# — A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028 and beyond.

Alt text: Professional business team meets in a modern office, Bahrain company formation. in the Diplomatic Area, sidestepping queues, relying on insider tips shared over countless cups of gahwa during Seef District majlis-style meetings. Bahrain’s business landscape seemed to hum with opportunity, but one question dominated my mind – did I really need a local sponsor for my company formation?*\
If you’re exploring Bahrain company formation—whether in the glitzy towers of Bahrain Bay or the dynamic office spaces of Seef—you’re not alone in wondering about local sponsorship and foreign ownership. With new 2025 policies shaking up the region, and economic optimism sweeping through Manama’s corridors of power, understanding Bahrain’s unique regulatory climate is more important than ever.\
The Bahrain Business Environment: 2025 and Beyond\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain Financial Harbour skyscrapers at sunset., Bahrain’s GDP expanded by 3.4% in the first quarter of 2025, outpacing both the UAE and Saudi Arabia in non-oil sector growth. Forbes Business recently ranked Bahrain as the top GCC destination for SME innovation, spotlighting its strong infrastructure, startup incentives, and regulatory transparency.\
\
The Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) forecasts $4.8 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows for 2025.\
Over 70% of all new registrations in the Diplomatic Area are now fully foreign-owned, a statistic nearly unthinkable just a decade ago.\
\
Recent regulatory changes—discussed in detail on the official Bahrain.com portal—now permit 100% foreign ownership for most commercial activities (from tech startups to consultancies). This is a stark divergence from the traditional GCC model, where local sponsorship has historically been the norm.\
Local Sponsor Requirements: The Real Story in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. holding at least 51% of shares. This is still the case in many UAE and Saudi structures.\
- Bahrain, however, has steadily liberalized foreign ownership rules—so much that specific business activities can now be fully owned by non-Bahrainis.\
Check this detailed breakdown of foreigner-friendly 100% ownership activities—the list is updated yearly and now comprises over 370 categories.\
When Local Sponsorship Is Still Required\
Some sectors—typically oil & gas extraction, certain commercial agencies, and defense—may still mandate a Bahraini partner or sponsor. If your activity sits within these regulated spaces, consult the official activity checker for the latest updates, or check directly with MOICT.\
2025 Regulatory Update: The New 99% Rule\
Earlier this year (January 2025), the MOICT implemented the “99% Foreign Ownership Rule” for several previously restricted industries. This update means foreign individuals or entities can now own up to 99%, with a Bahraini holding just 1%—a major reduction in local partner requirements. But don't overlook the small print: specific conditions on board composition or registered office location may still apply. I encountered this when registering a consultancy—by choosing Bahrain Bay for my office, I accessed new incentives but had to adjust my shareholder structure at the 11th hour.\
Foreign Ownership Policies: Bahrain vs. UAE & KSA\
Having worked across Dubai, Riyadh, and Manama, here’s my direct comparison:\
\
In the UAE, mainland companies still generally require 51% Emirati ownership unless based in free zones.\
Saudi Arabia, while opening to FDI, often requires complex SAGIA licensing and local sponsorship processes.\
Bahrain leads in true mainland 100% foreign ownership for most sectors—streamlining approvals through the Sijilat portal.\
\
The upshot? For tech, consulting, and professional services, Bahrain offers real ownership freedom—with less red tape and lower minimum capital requirements.\

\
Step 2: Prepare and File Your Application\
\
Documents: Passport copies, business plan, proof of address, MOA (memorandum of association), and sector-specific approvals.\
Sijilat Portal: Use the Sijilat system for digital company registration.\
Timing: Visit MOICT in the Diplomatic Area on Sundays or Wednesdays before 10am to avoid queues. (Insider tip: during Ramadan, business hours shift—arrive before 9am and bring your own copies to dodge the print-shop rush. I learned this the hard way—once missed my slot, lost four days of processing time.)\
\
Step 3: Secure Commercial Registration (CR)\
\
Processing time: 4-7 working days if all documents are in order and activity approvals are pre-obtained.\
LMRA Approvals: For companies planning to hire expatriates, Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) clearance is needed post-CR.\
\
Follow this detailed Bahrain company formation process for current timelines and specific requirements.\
Step 4: Post-Registration Requirements\
\
Accounting & Bookkeeping: Mandatory. Use a reputable local provider—see recommendations.\
Physical Office: Required for most activities; virtual offices are not accepted for CR issuance.\
Tamkeen Support: Apply for government-backed startup incentives as soon as your CR is active.\

Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Bahrain Company Formation\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, calculator and money on table.: BHD 120–250\
- Municipality License: BHD 15–50 (depending on office size/location)\
- Office Rental (Seef District): BHD 300–600/month for 2–3 desks in shared space\
- Legal & Documentation Costs: BHD 200–400 (translation, notary, etc.)\
- Local Sponsor/Partner (if required):** Annual fee can range from BHD 500–1,200\
\
Beware of hidden costs with bank account setup and LMRA deposits for expat visas (BHD 250–500 per employee).\

Cost-Saving Tips\
\
Office Location: Opt for spaces in Diplomatic Area or Bahrain Bay—these buildings often have on-site MOICT fast track counters, saving hours in paperwork processing.\
Avoiding Delays: Prepare all digital and hard copy documents in advance; incomplete files are the #1 cause of costly setbacks.\
Application Timing: Apply mid-month—MOICT faces the fewest applications during the second and third weeks, as I verified through direct dealings with their concierges.\
\
Legal Compliance in Bahrain: Stay Safe, Stay Legal\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, contract signing in a corporate environment. must be renewed annually, with penalties for late filings.\
- Bookkeeping: All WLLs and SPCs must maintain local accounts, submit VAT filings (5% on most goods/services), and undergo audit if revenue exceeds BHD 500,000.\
- Labor Law: Expat sponsorship (via LMRA) is employer-based. Visa quotas are determined by office size and registered activity.\
Check KeylinkBH compliance services for practical support.\
And—don’t overlook the small stuff. During one renewal process, I nearly ran afoul of a new 2025 AML (Anti-Money Laundering) document requirement. Solution? Regularly check both Bahrain.com regulatory updates and subscribe to MOICT email alerts.\
Business Culture: The Unseen Side of Compliance\
Traditional customs mesh with modern protocols: expect to be offered Arabic coffee during official meetings (accept with your right hand), and plan for lighter business hours during Ramadan. Networking often takes place over informal majlis gatherings in Seef District–relationships matter as much as documentation.\

A Tangent on Bahraini Hospitality: Why It Matters in Business\
Walking into a government office in Bahrain is unlike anywhere else in the GCC. Instead of the rigid formality found in Dubai or the high-security protocols of Riyadh, Bahraini officials often greet you with a warm “Marhaba!” and a quick chat about family or football. Once, a friendly MOICT officer in the Diplomatic Area offered me tips for securing a better office address—over a shared thermos of coffee. These tiny cultural nuances—genuine hospitality, relationship-building—can unlock real opportunities, and they underscore why business is often smoother here. And yes, they can even help you avoid the dreaded sponsor requirement!\
Frequently Asked Questions: Bahrain Company Formation\
Q1: Can a foreigner own 100% of a Bahrain WLL company?\
Absolutely. Most commercial, service, and industrial activities now qualify for 100% foreign ownership—check the activity list or consult MOICT for restricted sectors.\
Q2: When is a local sponsor still mandatory in Bahrain?\
A sponsor or local partner is required only for specific sectors—mainly in oil, defense, or certain retail segments. Use this local sponsorship information resource to double-check current rules.\
Q3: What is the cost of forming a Bahrain company?\
Expect BHD 800–2,500 as a realistic all-in first year budget. See the breakdown here.\
Q4: What are the post-setup compliance requirements?\
Annual CR renewal, VAT filings (if applicable), local accounting, and labor law compliance. Full details are available from trusted advisory firms.\
Q5: Which is better for foreign owners—mainland, free zone, or branch?\
Mainland (WLL/SPC) now offers real 100% ownership for most fields; free zones provide extra tax incentives but restrict activity scope. Compare options at Bahrain business structures.\

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No kids.
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size.
- Pleasing to the eyes (your mileage may vary, but so far the reviews are good 😏)

By day, I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). By night and during my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from FullyBooked.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and walking around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I’m also a sucker for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely. 💯 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my playful and adventurous side.

What I’m looking for… A guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you: 
- Age 27-35 years old
- Are well-groomed, carry yourself confidently 
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a CENOMAR cert when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- Preferably you’re in **Cebu City / Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives)

If this sounds like you…
Send me a DM and tell me: 
- About yourself comprehensively, like the important aspects in your background, current work, and/or long-term goals AND 
- Your go-to coffee order OR
- Your dream road trip destination OR
- The last book you couldn’t put down

I promise I don’t bite… unless you’re holding the last slice of cheesecake! 😚 Type the word cheesecake in your message to show you’ve read until this point.

1n7bjsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAEUpdate/comments/1n7bjsi/experience_of_visiting_phaedra_solutions_in_dubai/,Experience of Visiting Phaedra Solutions in Dubai,"If you’ve been thinking about working with a software development company in Dubai, or visiting one for partnership or hiring reasons, you're probably asking yourself:

**“What kind of people are they? What’s the energy like? Will I fit in?”**

That’s exactly why I want to share my experience of visiting **Phaedra Solutions in Dubai**.

From the moment I stepped into Building 1, DDP in Dubai Silicon Oasis, something felt different. 

The space, the people, the way they talk and work… It all had a quiet confidence to it. Not flashy. Just focused, thoughtful, and real.

If you're curious about the environment, the team, and what a visit might look like, this breakdown is for you.

https://preview.redd.it/wvxgukkzjxmf1.jpg?width=1408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be97c49a594c9fbd53dbad9a541ea39c1795dd07

# What You Need to Know About Phaedra Solutions

The space, layout, and location already say a lot about how a company thinks and works.

If you’re planning a visit (or just want a mental picture), here’s what you should know before stepping in.

**Where It Is & How It Feels to Walk In**

Phaedra Solutions is based in [Building 1 DDP – Dubai Silicon Oasis, Industrial Area, Dubai, United Arab Emirates](https://share.google/T7uIbqFfW1zoDb2N4). It’s a well‑known tech hub, so getting there is simple, whether you’re driving or catching a ride.

There’s no confusion once you arrive. The signage is clear, the entrance is easy to spot, and the whole setup feels intentionally low‑stress for visitors. 

Visiting Phaedra Solutions felt surprisingly smooth. No intimidating gatekeeping. No front-desk chaos. Just this quiet, calm vibe that puts you at ease.

Here’s what stood out right at the entrance:

* **Easy access and navigation** through the main building.  
* **Professional but relaxed lobby** that didn’t feel overly corporate.  
* **Warm greeting** from the team. Not robotic, just real people saying hi!  
* **Comfortable waiting area** with water, coffee, and a sense of quiet readiness.

# First Impressions — Atmosphere & Layout

The space feels open and easy to settle into. Not stiff or overly polished, just… comfortable. 

There’s a mix of work happening quietly and people casually chatting, and it all blends in a way that feels natural.

You’ll notice little things right away: soft lighting, a bit of greenery, and a layout that doesn’t cram people together. It’s not loud, but not silent either. Just enough background noise to know work’s getting done.

Here’s what stood out to me:

* A **reception area** that’s simple and friendly (not trying too hard)  
* **Workstations** that are open but spaced out, so no one’s on top of each other  
* A few **quiet nooks** for one-on-one chats or calls  
* Small, thoughtful details (like wall prints or warm lighting) that make it feel less like a tech box and more like a place to enjoy being in

Overall, the vibe was calm but focused. 

People seemed into their work, but not in a stressful or intense way. It’s the kind of setup that makes you feel like you’d want to spend a full day there.

# The People You Meet

You can tell a lot about a company by the way people greet you, and this team didn’t disappoint. 

The vibe was open, unpretentious, and refreshingly human. From leadership to design, no one acted like they were too busy to say hello or answer a question.

# The Team Vibe

From the moment I walked in, I met people who were friendly, approachable, and easy to talk to. No stiff handshakes or awkward small talk. Just relaxed conversations that felt real.

I had a brief chat with **Abubakar Shams**, the CEO. He came across as grounded and curious (not the kind of leader who hides in an office) 

Then there was **Mujtaba Ahmad**, the CTO, who had this calm confidence about him. You could tell he understood the tech, but also the people building it.

At one point, someone from the UX team asked if I wanted a coffee while we talked. Small gesture, but it stuck with me. It felt like they enjoyed having visitors around, not just tolerating them.

There’s a sense that people here *like* working together. Conversations were happening across desks, people bounced ideas mid-sentence, and no one looked isolated or overwhelmed.

# How They Work Together

It’s not just a team, it feels like a crew that’s used to building things *together*. I saw designers walking through wireframes with developers, a few short syncs happening at the whiteboard, and a couple of teammates casually reviewing something on-screen in a corner.

There was no noise about processes or fancy titles. Just people getting work done and checking in with each other along the way.

You could tell they’re set up to collaborate well. Some of the tools I saw mentioned during chats included:

* **ClickUp** for quick back-and-forth  
* **Figma** for design and prototyping  
* **Zoom** and **Google Meet** for calls with global clients  
* **InVision** for sharing mockups and flows

The overall feel? Everyone seemed in sync, moving in the same direction without needing to over-explain. 

It wasn’t loud, chaotic, or overly structured. Just smart people working side by side.

# A Peek at the Phaedra Solutions Office

You can tell when an office is built just to look good, and when it’s built to help people work better. This one falls into the second category.

It’s not flashy, but it’s smart. Everything has a purpose, and it shows.

# Office Layout & Design

The layout here feels like it was designed by people who work in offices. Nothing cramped, no awkward dead zones, just space that flows naturally.

Here’s what stood out:

* **Open-plan areas** where people can chat, ask questions, or just glance at someone’s screen  
* A few **quiet corners** for solo work or taking a quick breather  
* **Meeting nooks** with comfy seating—not stiff boardroom stuff, just relaxed spaces to think or talk  
* A layout that invites movement (you don’t feel stuck in one spot all day)

It feels like the kind of place where collaboration happens by default, not just by scheduling a meeting.

# Facilities That Make a Difference

There are a few thoughtful touches that make the space more livable, not just workable.

* A small kitchen area with coffee and snacks, where teammates hang out between tasks  
* Water stations right where you’d want them (not hidden in some far-off corner)  
* Breakout spaces with soft seating that don’t feel like a waiting room  
* Fast Wi-Fi everywhere (yes, I checked)

It’s the kind of setup that respects your energy. You’re not scrambling to find a spot to focus or somewhere to pause. Everything’s just… there when you need them.

# Reputation, Work, and How They Operate

After spending some time at the office, there were a few things I found out that made the visit even more interesting.

# 1. Recognition & Reputation

I didn’t walk in thinking, “This place must have awards.” But later, I found out they’re actually pretty well recognized (both locally and globally).

* **Top-rated on Clutch, GoodFirms, and Upwork**, with an average of 4.9/5 stars  
* Recently named one of the **Top AI Companies in the UAE** by Clutch (July 2025)

None of that was plastered on the walls, but it does explain why their process feels polished and confident. It’s the kind of quiet reputation that backs up what you see on the ground.

# 2. Projects & Focus Areas

They’re not just doing generic app development here. The range of work happening behind the scenes is broader than I expected.

During conversations, I heard mentions of:

* AI-powered cloud surveillance systems  
* Internal incident-tracking tools for clients  
* E-commerce dashboards  
* Custom software for complex business ops

Their team works across AI, software development, and e-commerce, but without making it feel like a chaotic mix. Each project seems to have a clear owner and direction.

# 3. Communication & Transparency

One thing that stood out was how open the team seemed with each other (and with clients).

They’re big on updates and regular check-ins. I heard ClickUp pings here and there, and people casually sharing timelines or next steps out loud.

From what I gathered, they keep clients in the loop daily, not just at milestone reviews.

Calls, Loom videos, shared docs, it all seems like part of their default rhythm.

And honestly, that transparency shows in how the team talks, too. No hiding behind jargon or overpromising, just people explaining things clearly and directly.

# Wrapping Up

Visiting Phaedra Solutions in Dubai gave me a clear sense of who they are. Not just what they build, but how they work and treat people. 

The space felt open, the team was easy to talk to, and there was a quiet confidence in how things were run.

From the thoughtful layout to transparent communication, everything pointed to a company that values clarity, collaboration, and real connection.

Whether you're a potential client, a partner, or someone curious about joining the team, visiting Phaedra Solutions offers more than just a tour. It gives you insight into how a solid tech team operates day to day.

It’s not a loud or flashy place. It’s better. It’s real. Welcoming. Human. And built for people who care about doing meaningful work.

1n7bjdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1n7bjdr/trip_thoughts/,Trip thoughts,"Went to Vegas for Labor Day weekend. Not really my scene but it was free. It definitely wasn’t dead. Stated at the Fontainebleau. Beautiful hotel. Great service. Fun to watch the pool crowd during the day and the club crowd at night. The coffee situation sucked. No maker in the room and $7 for a cup. We did not eat at the hotel. 

The strip was really busy and during the day the strip bus was a great option to get around. Starting around dinner the bus became unusable because of traffic. 

Went for the prime rib at south point and that was a great deal. Got some pizza at evel pie. Solid but not great. Fremont was crazy and fun. Went for a late night bite at one of the station casinos and it was really good. 

Noticed the casinos off the strip were a lot busier than the casinos on the strip. 

Since Vegas isn’t my thing, we went to Grand Canyon west on Sunday. Left at 530a and we’re back in Vegas by 3. Expensive and not as good as the south rim. But if you have not been to the GC, it’s worth the trip/cost. 

Takeaway: prices for anything on the strip are insane. Off the strip there are plenty of deals to be had. Vegas is not dead. ",5,1756896699.0,vegas,3,0.78,False

I own a GCP that is sadly falling apart at this stage(boiler flaking, solenoid needs replacing) and because the parts are a pain in the ass to get here I am instead considering to finally upgrade to something nicer! Lucky enough my Sculptor 064S is working perfectly fine and does exactly what I ask it to! 

Now I live in a pretty isolated country which means two things; one, my choices are kinda limited and two machines can cost an arm and a leg. To put it into perspective, a Profitec Pro 300 costs around $2250. So anyway, regarding the use of the machine, I tend to pull two shots  a day (back to back) throughout the week and then 3 shots per day Saturday/Sunday as we usually have visitors. I personally drink my coffee black while my wife would have hers with a bit of milk. While I do like to deep dive and perfect puck prep and all that jazz, she isn't interested in any of it and would rather just be able to pull a shot without having to think about it too much.

With that out of the way, I'm looking at a machine at or under $2000 USD and so far here's are the options I am considering while being open minded to anything else you might suggest! 

Lelit Mara X $1650
Lelit Elizabeth $1700
Quick Mill Pop Up $1300
Ascaso Duo PID (not the steel) $1650

I would also like to add that while I know a lot of people love it, I am not a big fan of E61 appearance in full steel, just not my jam. I did see the Mara in person today and I'll admit that the black with wood accent was actually quite sexy hence why I added it to the list! ",2,1756896692.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No kids.
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size.
- Pleasing to the eyes (your mileage may vary, but so far the reviews are good 😏)

By day, I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). By night and during my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from FullyBooked.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and walking around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I’m also a sucker for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely. 💯 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my playful and adventurous side.

What I’m looking for… A guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you: 
- Age 27-35 years old
- Are well-groomed, carry yourself confidently 
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a CENOMAR cert when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- Preferably you’re in **Cebu City / Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives)

If this sounds like you…
Send me a DM and tell me: 
- About yourself comprehensively, like the important aspects in your background, current work, and/or long-term goals AND 
- Your go-to coffee order OR
- Your dream road trip destination OR
- The last book you couldn’t put down

I promise I don’t bite… unless you’re holding the last slice of cheesecake! 😚 Type the word cheesecake in your message to show you’ve read until this point.

Will ignore messages na walang ka effort 🙅🏻‍♀️  Pls lng, may effort naman post ko, hope you’ll reciprocate ha 😇

A friend of mine has been doing me small favors lately like giving me rides, covering a coffee here and there, or helping me with errands. I’m genuinely thankful, but now I’m starting to feel like I’m “in debt,” even though they’ve never said anything about it.

The problem is that every time I try to return the favor or even just say thanks in a bigger way, they brush it off. I don’t want them to think I’m taking advantage of their kindness, but I also don’t want to make it awkward by over-explaining.

1n7bca1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1n7bca1/ladies_do_you_match_or_even_engage_with_a/,"Ladies, do you match or even engage with a suspected traveler guy when you're looking for a long-term relationship/life partner?","So, this is a bit of Rant mixed with questions on how to avoid these unpleasant traveler guys, so I hope you can bear with me.

I basically get likes from guys who live locally to me. But I get fair amount of likes from guys who may not live in the city/even the country, basically a traveler. I also see fair amount of suspected travelers in the Discover tab (because I live in the top 5 hottest destination to travel in the world for all rankings). 

But not 100% sure because he may not be using Travel Mode or simply put the city name of where I live, and they may not live in the city.

But those that say they live in another city/country and their current location just shows your city/surrounding area, do you left swipe the guy? Or do you right swipe to like or to match even?

If you matched them, and they reveal you they're traveler, do you continue the conversation?

I ask this because up until now, I had been open minded just to engage with guys who may have been a traveler, and met a few even. But unless they split their time in two countries actually living in my city fair amount out of the year/elsewhere in another country, I just don't see the point in engaging with these men. 

Firstly, they woud not relocate to my city even if they said they wanted to or thought about it (lacking qualificatons/education level to be approved of visa for example), unless they actually have the immediate plan to relocate (like they're transferring in a month to my city via corporate transfer.)

Secondly, and this is why I am contemplating to auto left swipe these traveler men is that they come across quite rude/absolutely off-putting often. And not all but some are quite unpleasant to deal with. I mean this is no US city or some progressive liberal city or some far right country town. And not just US in particular but many seem to be American guys who are very rude. Where I am is a conservative and traditonal country rather deep in history, 360 degree different culture from America, and totally different norms and the dating scene. These guys from abroad seem to have zero manner in how it works in this country. Just because I speak English or I grew up in North America doesn't mean they can behave just like back home. Some local ladies here complained to me about this too when we were discussing about dating foreign travelers.

I mean, no guys here would behave with one line sentence in the chat (never), or suggest low effort date or put on their profile ""FAR RIGHT swipe left!"" or ""Don't talk to me if you voted for Trump!!"" or ""I don't believe in 50/50 and I lead the relationship 100%. I am a traditional man. You MUST be willing to take care of the house and kids! 100%!!"". They seem to be far right or far left, in some of the men I received likes from. I am not sure who these people think they are coming here to bring foreign politics from abroad. It's fine if they believe in whatever over in the US. But don't bring their toxic dating culture here while they are a mere visitor here. Visitors are highly believed to behave/suppose to be on their BEST behavior when they visit other countries/come here. And this is especially true in where I live currently, especially with local ladies here. Not ok to just misbehave like back home completly acting like A-hole as a foreigner. Not welcome here. 

They also act VERY entitled too. Very off-putting... I got guys from California asking me let's meet up at 11 p.m. and asked me to go to his hotel for drinks. Like what is that? I refused. Then the next early morning like 7 a.m. he texted me 10 messages saying can we meet at 8:30 a.m.. for coffee and he wants to visit me just near my place or at my home for morning coffee. Like what is this? Do they think I'm stupid?? Very disrespectful omg. I refused of course. I had meetings and was working. Then I got this guy, asking me for drinks at 10:45 p.m. if I could go to his bar he is having drinks at RIGHT NOW because the ladies he was drinking with right now were ""ugly"" and he much prefers my company calling me beautiful and how hot I was etc. (and I was already in bed watching TV). And that he was leaving tomorrow back to the US and he just wanted my company. Wow what is this? It was not even Friday. It was Thursday night I recall.. I mean, very rude...and they know I am looking for long-term/life-partner. Oh, and he had a nerve to text me on IG 3 weeks later saying he is coming here again in a week, if he won the boxing competition, would I meet him for coffee..yeah dude no thank you. I unmatched, blocked, and blocked him on IG seconds later, such a weirdo...

So I want to avoid these unpleasant unsavory a-holes from abroad, partly because I am finding engaging with travelers is a total waste of time/unpleasant in general. And I am not into LDR. I prefer my guy to be here, and date here locally. I am not into LDR. I date Americans/Canadians and European guys, who live here. They're not ignorant, they're nice to me, and they know the local dating scene and they don't request absurd things. I don't want travelers. 

How do other ladies who seek long-term/life partner in other locations where you get lots of traveler guys deal with these out of country a-holes or out of town rude ones? Do you automatically swipe left when you suspect he is a traveler?

Iv recently bought a new road bike, so my older one, I decided, will be my commuter/winter bike. I have recently started commuting with this older bike and I have learned fast that commuting ain't the same as going for a Sunday morning coffee ride.

My main concerns were getting my backpack off of my back because I sweat alot. And also the issue of trying to stay dry because it perpetually rains in my part of the world. The only issue is that my bike has NO mounts for any of this stuff. 

I bought a Topeak Tetrarack to strap to the seat stays and that solved the issue of sweaty back, but now my LBS tells me that there is no way to add mudguards because the only ones that would work would be ones that strap to the seat stays where I already have my rack. 

Also the added weight means that I'm constantly getting pinch flats on my rear tyre due to the route I take for work being mainly light gravel bridleways with the odd sharp rock scattered throughout. My bike can only accommodate max 25mm tires. 

Any advise?

PS: I know I could use a dedicated commuter bike but I have a 12 mile commute and I like to do it within 45-50 minutes. Also I much prefer drop bars over flat bars as flats seem to give me shoulder pain.",5,1756895701.0,cycling,3,0.86,False

Dear reader, I am obviously a stranger, well most likely anyways lol, that would be some coincidence😂Kendu has a very welcoming and diverse community with members from around the world, I am personally from England. We have groups for different languages: Spanish, Arabic, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, Korean, Thai, Turkish, Zulu.

Under the Kendu umbrella you can release products, receive insanely strong social media engagement and sell your product to an already established user base. For example we have energy drinks, coffee, beer, clothes, shoes, video games, spices already and so much more! You can come and join the party too with whatever your interests are. You can also plan IRL events like we have a team in Florida called KenduSTREET who attend lots of festivals and spread the Kendu brand! Or in India we have had Pickleball competitions and also a running club! Whatever it is the KENDU Community will be very appreciative, whether you have been here 1 day or since day 1 this opportunity is open to everyone. **You can explore your creative passions and desires with Kendu!**

Now I do understand if you are only here to make money because admittedly I was at the start but that has since changed. Anyways, at currently 13 million market cap Kendu is an absolute steal, the vast majority of memes are down this year and Kendu is no different, we have around a 21x to ATH, this is literally free money. If you put in $1000, chances are you're gonna make at least $20k this AltSeason whenever it hits. **This is obviously NFA,** but I am certainly investing my money.

The crypto game is a lot about community, community effort is everything and Kendu has this in bags. Check any crypto subreddit, we will dominate it, check any X post we will be there, check on Stocktwits we are a leader etc. This is no accident, if we look at the past all the strongest communities have come out on top from Shib to Doge to Pepe to whatever else you want, historically the strongest communities are the most likely to perform the best in terms of price action. This time its not gonna be any different...

Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes(it is a very sought after audit), the only other coin to manage this was Pepe. Pepe reached 10 billion market cap outside of a bull run... this just shows the potential that Kendu has. If Pepe can reach 10 billion Kendu can soar past this.

Murad and other prominent crypto people preach community, community, community.

So why not buy Kendu?

Literal life changing money is on the table and tbh it is the most educated investment you can make rn, coins over 500 million have kinda had most of their pump. Kendu still has a 25x before we reach there current market cap...

1n7b3wd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1n7b3wd/she_cancelled_our_date_a_few_hours_before_meeting/,She cancelled our date a few hours before meeting😭,"So I’ve been talking to this girl for about a month and a few weeks. We met at Comic-Con so we’ve seen each other in person but not for long. We get along really well, have similar interests, and talk every day on text. A week ago, I asked if she wanted to grab a coffee, and she happily agreed. She even said she was excited to explore the city together since neither of us knows it well.

For context, she was actually the one who first suggested I come down to meet her. We live kinda far apart (like a 2-hour coach ride for me), but I didn’t mind making the trip.

Anyway, yesterday she messaged me saying she hoped she could find a dog sitter for her dog. The second I read that, I kinda knew she was gonna cancel. Sure enough, a few hours before we were supposed to meet, she said she couldn’t find a sitter and couldn’t make it.

Here’s the part I don’t get: •	We confirmed the date a week ago, so why wait until the last minute to figure this out? •	She goes to work regularly, so does she always need a sitter for that? •	We were only going to be out for a couple of hours, and it’s not like her dog is sick or anything.

She did say we could reschedule, but I’m hesitant because I feel like she might just cancel again. I told her I’d be down if she actually wants to go, but now I’ve been left on “seen.”

The annoying part? I already booked my coach ticket. So now I’m still gonna go because the city has a Forbidden Planet store with cool Godzilla figures I wanna check out 😭. But my return ticket is at 7:30 pm, so now I have to figure out how to kill 8 hours by myself.",1,1756895182.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

This morning I got up, took care of my human needs, walked from one end of my house to the other (I mean it’s not a huge house but still), let the dogs out, made a cup of coffee and went back to the back door to let the dogs in… and then got a stand reminder. It’s become a joke on my house that I’ve been levitating again. 

I work at a standing desk and often have an hour or so during the day where I just don’t get stand credit. When I’m working on an intense project and hyper focused I get it but most of the day I’m on my feet and full of restless energy so moving and shifting around. ",2,1756895047.0,AppleWatch,1,1.0,False
