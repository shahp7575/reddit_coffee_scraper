I live in the countryside with my parents and my 2 older brothers. All the men in my family are in the army (my father joined a bit later in his life tho, that’s why he’s older than the average lieutenant). My mother also wants me to marry a military man. I’m from quite a traditional family (this is important). My father is a lieutenant, one of my brothers is a NCO and the other one is still in training (my brothers ranks aren’t really important in the story tho).

One time my father invited his captain over for coffee. They have quite a good relationship and I think you can even call them friends. Anyway as usual me and my mom served them coffee. His captain in particular didn’t seem like he had any intention of keeping his eyes off me. I got a bit uneasy but I didn’t want to disrespect him and just tried to convince myself he just liked me.

Later on I got a message on instagram (I don’t really use instagram) from his captain. Keep in mind I never gave him my socials; he found it. He kept and kept texting me, like every single time I opened insta I saw like 100+ messages from him. It seemed like he was obsessed. He even straight up told me he was in love with me and asked me to marry him.

I obviously said no and told my mother. She just got very excited and told me to say yes. She got mad at me for saying no, called me ungrateful. My mother is quite family oriented and loves the idea of me marrying someone my father knows and she also liked he was an officer.

It kept getting weirder and weirder. He send me letters. Kept finding excuses to visit my home (I live in the countryside so he would have to drive like 45 minutes to come here!). He sended me unsolicited money, like 100 or 200 at the time. What most disturbed me was him getting a tattoo of my name above his… privates. He seemed quite convinced we were married, or that we were at least destined for each other.

My brother (the NCO) is in his chain of command, and my brother said he treated him better than before. Like that he doesn’t yell at him so often and sometimes invites him to have coffee etc. He doesn’t know about him liking me.

One time when I wanted to visit base to see my father and brothers, I saw him. He literally took a picture of me. He also sends me like a lot of pictures he takes of me, like the one he took on base but also ones he found from somewhere else, maybe through my brother??

Anyway so please give me advice on what to do I really don’t know what to do. Also share your thoughts. My mom thinks he just likes me. What do you think? And please give me advice",0,1748700407.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

I’m talking real convos, laughter over voice notes, random deep dives into philosophy, and “what would you do if you won the lottery” type questions.

Here’s a bit about me:
	•	Ideal weekend? Start with a workout or a hike, grab a coffee and a croissant, beach in the afternoon, and close the day with a good BBQ and even better company.
	•	I’m a morning person, and yes, I will be that guy sending “what’s up” texts at 6am.
	•	I love all kinds of convos but especially the ones where we go off-topic and get lost in the tangents.
	•	Dream pet? Two cane corsos that look tough but melt for cuddles.
	•	I’m a fan of learning — talk to me about anything you love, even if I know nothing about it. Especially if I know nothing about it.
	•	I lean spontaneous, prefer music and voice notes over memes, and value transparency over sugar-coating.
	•	Architecture, travel, food, and minimizing inflammation through recovery are all things I could talk about for days.
	•	Texts, voice messages, pictures — whatever keeps a connection flowing, I’m here for it.

Let’s talk if you’re someone who:
Wants to build something real. Likes to laugh. Doesn’t mind a little emotional depth. And maybe has a playlist they’re proud of.

I've created a template for building blogs with [typst](https://typst.app/), based on my own blog's architecture. There was a [post](https://forum.typst.app/t/my-static-site-blog-based-on-astro-and-typst/4103) where I shared my initial approach.

Astronauts may ask what is typst. It is a markup language that can easily embed math equations, diagrams, and figures. I personally has replaced my most usage of Markdown and LaTeX with typst.

I had good time to build it! The typst content is seamlessly integrated into astro, and I can reuse rss, sitemap, and many other astro integrations. It is amazing. To enrich my blog's capabilities, I create many typst show rules that enhance semantics fluently. Most impressively, I now export content to various formats without duplicating them. I guess few people will archive their blog posts and articles in PDF format, but I did it. Sounds like the real ""write once, publish everywhere"". Many thanks to astro and typst.

When I noticed guys forking my project, I modularized the architecture into `tylant`, meaning `typst` integrated into the astro [islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/). I conceived this name without the help of LLM in 5 minutes, so please forgive me if this name sounds stupid. It would be also great if you have some nice name and tell me.

To start with `tylant`, simply start with one command:

    # npm or pnpm
    pnpm create @myriaddreamin/tylant@latest

Currently, `pnpm` commands are hardcoded in the create script (so you need to install pnpm) but I think it can be easy to support `npm` and `yarn` with some simple changes. Also feel free to open issues on GitHub if you have any problem or ideas.

1kzxk3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/RichardAllenInnocent/comments/1kzxk3x/the_attacks_on_kathy_allen_need_to_stop/,The attacks on Kathy Allen need to STOP.,"I get it that people wanted CW and MA to start work on a Post Conviction Investigation but that isnt happening. A contract was drafted, but apparently the A's had some issues with the document and it went unsigned.


I believe that one of those issues was using YouTube personalities as investigators. These people are not trained or qualified to do this work. 

RA had some terrible PI's for his 1st trial I don't want that to happen again. Already a Tweeter (Twitter person) contacted one of the 3 basketball girls and posted it on Twitter and YouTube. Real investigators don't do that.

Another YouTuber received a video (it was claimed that it was submitted by a whistle blower) and released it on YouTube. This is not appropriate.

Did we see BA or MH on Twitter or on YouTube? No.

The Allen's have made their decision and people need to accept it, but I see all of these attacks on KA and I can't stand it.

Does KA have questionable friends? Yes, I don't trust these people. I don't think that they are state actors but EM is overly emotional and gets too much wrong to be of any real help. But KA has an attorney and RA has appellate counsel I am sure that she consults these lawyers.

I cannot believe for a single second that legal counsel wanted that contract signed and KA refused. KA wants RA home more than any of us and I believe she would do anything to make that happen.

But every single person saying that KA is too close to the issue, influenced by bad people, or deciding on emotion and shouldn't be permitted to make decisions on RA's behalf are forgetting one single thing:

RA COULD SIGN THAT CONTRACT ON HIS OWN AND HE DIDNT. 

Was RA even asked? Did he say no too? It sounded to me like he expected someone to visit him about the contract and that never happened (based on RA's joke about a coffee).

1kzxez2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1kzxez2/mi_amor/,Mi amor 🐧,"I’m writing this letter to you. 

  From the moment I walked away. At that moment the first few months felt like I was overwhelmed with everyone’s expectations. I didn’t handle it one at a time. It was easy at first handling it all at once. Then I slowly began feeling comfortable with a friend of mine. More comfortable enough that I ended up loving her as she being herself. Around 6months in we ended up agreeing to live under the same room. Cos seemed more convenient for both of us knowing we took on the same profession. 

On the nearing ending months. She started taking care of me emotionally, mentally. Unknowingly in my part, which I realized later on. A part of your personality started coming out. Felt exactly like you took over her body to reach out to me and took care of me. Out of nowhere everything felt so familiar and felt like home with her. Excited to open the door whenever she knocks. Cooked her favorite go to meals. Make coffee for her. Guess what? She gets midnight cravings! Whenever she’s nearing on her cycle. She craves ice cream like you! Even brings a flask like you. My body automatically responds on refilling it. Whenever she gets sick like you? A single cough of nightmare. My body responds right away waking up to tend to her just like how I tend to you. It felt all to real like it was you. 

It didnt scare me. But got me more invested for I did walk away and felt emotionally cheating on you. My body reciprocated to make my wrongs right. But mentally aware she was still in love with her past. When she walked away. It did felt like you did too. Which I felt deeply. I failed her, most especially failed you, again. 

As now, I personally strayed away from anyone. Not that I feel depressed or any upsetting. More of bringing myself back to my best. Hoping that Id come cross the same corner with you, and get my life on track, and do everything, better, and right. I want to give you a great future, a family, a home. That I promised from the start. Til the end. Ill keep it when its time, for you to sit with me. In our little family table.

1kzxew3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaPavoniLovers/comments/1kzxew3/one_mans_path_to_europiccola_happiness/,one man's path to Europiccola happiness,"shortly after i got into coffee seriously -- almost four decades ago! -- i found myself living in an Italian neighbourhood and ... well, espresso! so espresso has been the ""real"" coffee for me ever since. roughly 6 months ago i admitted to myself that while i'd been drinking good home-brewed coffee all these years in every imaginable form that was NOT espresso it was always a little bit unsatisfying, primarily because it wasn't espresso. i decided to look around and -- long story short -- the Europiccola very much looked like the right way for me to go.

i found it very easy to get scared off by the stories about how difficult the Europiccola is, or how you need tons of gear to get it right or it'll never be as good as ""real"" espresso and all that sort of white noise that every half-serious would-be consumer faces when researching a thing. in the end i decided to take my chances and purchased a new machine and a nice set of wooden handles to go with.

all in all it's turned out to be no big deal. yes it took a couple weeks of trial and error to get it right but once that's behind you you're off to the races. before i give details i should say that i roast and grind my own beans so i know and can (more or less) control pretty much everything from green bean to cup. so, the process i've settled on with very satisfactory results is:

\- i pre-heat my machine for about 20 mins with porta-filter in place. a cold porta-filter seems to kill crema; a scorching porta-filter seems to cause over-extraction and the bitterness that goes with it.  
\- fresh medium-to-slightly-dark roasted beans, typically roast date + 2-20ish days is the optimal ""freshness"" range. with beans 20+ days old or more it becomes increasingly difficult to get good crema.  
\- i use a grind that is ever so slightly courser than too fine to allow the pressurised water to pass through the puck in a ""reasonable"" time (your call here but i don't like my grounds to get too hot and thus scorched). 12-13g of beans seems to work best for me but YMMV.  
\- grind, load, puck screen in place, lift the lever until the first sound of hissing steam and then back off just enough to stop the hissing, hold the lever at that position while you snug the porta-filter in and put your cup in place, then gently lift the lever all the way up (no need to rush this).  
\- wait for the pressurised water to start dribbling out of the porta-filter and into the cup, usually takes about 5ish seconds from the time the lever hits the fully raised position.  
\- slowly and steadily pull the lever down, roughly 7-10 seconds to complete the pull from top to bottom. if all is well it should be crema flowing into the cup almost all the way.  
\- wait a couple seconds for some pressurised water to pass through into the cup, but don't wait for the last few drops to dribble through (theory is those are going to have max extraction = max bitterness and that's probably not what you want).  
\- with any luck you've now got a very nice cup of espresso to enjoy.

needless to say this is just my process, not Europiccola doctrine. I wanted to show that as intimidating as it may sound to the uninitiated it's actually pretty simple, with wonderfully repeatable good results.

one last thing: leave yourself a bit of cash to buy a few accessories. i found a basic tamping station, tamper, dosing funnel and puck screen to be most helpful: i didn't buy fancy stuff, total came to maybe €75. and maybe buy yourself a nice espresso cup or three. :)",1,1748698961.0,LaPavoniLovers,0,0.67,False
1kzxebp,https://www.reddit.com/r/KnowBeforeBuy/comments/1kzxebp/the_complete_stepbystep_guide_to_an_organized/,The Complete Step-by-Step Guide to an Organized (Real-Life) Kitchen,"Your kitchen doesn’t need to look like a glossy magazine spread. It just needs to work for *you*. This guide helps you declutter, clean, and organize a warm, functional, and stress-free kitchen, one that works even when you’ve got a toddler underfoot and a million other things to juggle.

# Step 1: Organize What You See

Focus on visual clutter first.... countertops, fridge tops, open shelves.

|Area|What to Do|Tools/Tips|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Countertops|Remove everything. Keep only daily-use items (e.g., toaster, microwave).|Use trays/baskets for water bottles, oils, condiments.|
|Open shelves|Sort books/recipes. Use files for loose sheets.|Alphabetize or categorize cookbooks. Move extras to other rooms.|
|Fridge/Oven top|Clear and clean.|Use bowls/jars for random sachets (e.g., pizza seasoning).|
|Appliances|Remove all. Reintroduce only essentials.|Avoid clutter: Less is more visually.|

**Mini-Tip**: “Like with like” – group similar-use items together to save time.

# Step 2: Organize What You Use

Cabinets, drawers, and utensils need functionality, not perfection.

|Area|What to Do|Storage Hacks|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Drawers|Remove, clean, declutter. Toss what’s broken/unused.|Use drawer organizers, old boxes, or small bowls.|
|Cabinets|Group by category (baking, breakfast, snacks).|Store packets in bins. Stack cans.|
|Rarely used items|Store deep in cabinets or higher shelves.|Use bigger utensils to hold smaller ones (e.g., store cookie cutters in a mixing bowl).|
|Essentials|Dedicate shelves to daily-use: one for cookware, one for glassware.|Keeps access quick and storage safe.|

# Step 3: Organize What’s Left

Handle the less-visible spots like under-sink storage and wall spaces.

|Area|What to Do|Space-Saving Ideas|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Under sink|Store cleaning supplies + garbage bags.|Use stackable bins with lids.|
|Inside cabinet doors|Hang small tools.|Use adhesive hooks or magnetic strips.|
|Walls/sides of cabinets|Add hooks or open shelves.|Hang mitts, sieves, mugs.|
|Empty wall corners|Reserve for future shelves or portable racks.|No budget? Skip shelves; just declutter.|

# Step 4: Keeping It Organized + Pretty

A clean, cozy kitchen doesn’t require big money..... just small habits.

|Habit|What It Helps With|
|:-|:-|
|Clean as you go|No build-up of mess. Easier maintenance.|
|One in, one out|Prevents clutter from returning.|
|Nightly reset|Put everything back. Quick countertop wipe-down.|
|Add personality|*yours*Jars of spices, family photos, fun potholders. Makes space  .|

# Summary: Quick Kitchen Organization Checklist

|Principle|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Start small|One shelf or drawer at a time. Avoid burnout.|
|Store by category|Group items by type or usage.|
|Use hidden space|Cabinet doors, under-sink, wall corners.|
|Avoid overbuying|Stick to “One In, One Out” to avoid pile-up.|
|Make it yours|Add decor that reflects your personality.|

# Five Easy Steps to a Clean Kitchen… Always

Functional AND sparkling? Yes, please. Here's a quick framework to make it happen.

# 1. Keep Only What’s Useful or Beautiful

|Task|Example|
|:-|:-|
|Declutter ruthlessly|Toss broken tools, donate unused gadgets.|
|Do one cabinet at a time|Break up the job for less stress.|

# 2. Store Like Items Together

|Category|Storage Tip|
|:-|:-|
|Plates, bowls, glassware|Stack or group in shelves/drawers.|
|Coffee stuff|Keep mugs, filters, sugar near the coffee machine.|
|Cleaning supplies|Use a caddy or small basket under the sink.|

# 3. Clear + Bare Countertops

|Rule|Why|
|:-|:-|
|Only 2 gadgets max|Easy to clean + visually calm.|
|Use drawers + shelves|Hide the rest. Keeps surfaces usable.|
|Add 1 fun item|A pretty utensil holder or recipe stand. Optional but mood-boosting.|

# 4. Kitchen Cleaning Hacks

|Trick|Why It Works|
|:-|:-|
|Wipe spills *immediately*|Prevents tough grime and sticky mess.|
|Keep a spray handy|Quick cleanups post-cooking. (Try vinegar + baking soda!)|
|Rinse before soaking dishes|Avoids dried-on food and pests.|

# 5. Cleaning Routines

|Frequency|Tasks|
|:-|:-|
|**Daily**|\- Wipe counters and appliances - Sweep/mop floors - Wash + put away dishes - Empty + disinfect trash can - Change dishcloths|
|**Weekly**|\- Clean cabinets + walls - Wipe exhaust + lighting - Deep clean stove, oven, fridge - Organize pantry, crockery - Wash kitchen curtains|
|**Monthly**|\- Empty/clean cabinets - Audit pantry: toss expired items - Deep wash rarely used utensils - Donate/repair/replace what's not working|

Got two untoasted bagels (Mistake one). My everything was simply pretending to be, with sesame seeds and a stray poppy seed or two, no sign of any other toppings. My bacon wound up on my partner’s GF bagel. (Mistakes two and three). Coffees were both mediums (mistake four but at least in our favor). Upcharged $2 for two splashes of almond milk in each coffee (not a mistake, but c’mon ffs). 3% fee for using a CC. No line but felt generally disorganized—pick up bagels in back, come back up front for coffees which weren’t ready even after waiting a few mins for the incorrect bagels order. Bagels weren’t cut thru all the way so just a messy eating experience. The quality was ok, but this is NJ, so no shortage of great bagels without all this nonsense. Sorry, fans, this was way disappointing, so explain to me why there’s usually a line here. Is it because they’re disorganized or are you really there for the bagels etc?

1kzx5vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kzx5vm/am_i_overreacting_my_mum_gets_offended_when_i/,Am I overreacting? My mum gets offended when I bring up that my cousin (30M) SA me (21F) in my sleep,"Trigger warning. This happened around 2 years ago, I invited my cousin to my city for his birthday. I felt bad for him because he's just been stuck in the same town, living with my mum for a few years now (he's a refugee)

As the title says, he SA me whilst I was sleeping. I didn't report it, I didn't kick him out the next day and I didn't bring it up. I did nothing. My mum was staying in a hotel (to see me and explore the city) and we (my cousin and I) met with her.

A few months later, I decided to move back home to my mum. I wasn't planning to stay long, but we began really getting on for the first time since I was about 3 years old. Truly, I am so thankful and lucky for this. 

When I moved in, my cousin (who was still living there) asked to speak with me (whilst my mum was at work). I agreed. He asked me what happened that night, I explained (what I could. Remember, I was not even 100% sure it happened for months. Like I knew it in my body but my brain was still questioning it) and he started getting all angry saying stuff like “why didn't you push me off?” or “hit me to stop”. Like bro, I was asleep. Anyway, I defended myself and reminded him he was the one in the wrong. This was when he pretended to cry and I assured him that I wouldn't tell anyone, which conveniently was when the pathetic “trying to cry” face stopped. 

Anyway, I broke that promise and told my mum a few months later. Once she found it, he continued living here until he got engaged. My mum and her boyfriend even met up with him and his partner to celebrate their engagement. It hurt, and I had to pretend all was good because if I said anything she'd say “Get over it” 

These three words haunt me now. I hate them. 

Every time I have brought it up, which is very very rarely, my mum tells me to just get over it. Yesterday we got into a huge fight because I mentioned it again. She picked up her bottle of wine, rolled her eyes and went upstairs, saying “We are not talking about this” in an annoyed voice. I, admittedly after quite a lot of drinks,
started shouting and sobbing. Saying things like 

“what do you mean???? Why can't I talk about this?? Why do you just want me to get over it? I am over it I just want to talk about it sometimes. The amount of shit I help you process and all the traumatic things you have shared with me since I was a young child. But I am sorry that this is too much for you” 

She then started screaming back at me “But why didn't you report it, why!?! You could have reported it and you didn't so get over it” in a patronizing way. 

She kept coming back to me not “reporting it”.I don't understand it leaves me so speechless like what has that got to do with it??

I asked her why she didn't report it when I told her. (I wasn't implying she should have, I was just throwing the same question back at her because I do not understand why this is the topic of conversation) she laughed and said in a patronizing voice “Yes I'm sorry for not reporting that my little child was SA 5 months ago”- if it's not obvious she was mocking me 

This kept going, and I was just losing it and just sobbing. She would sincerely apologise at one point then bring it back to “Why didn't you report it, it's a bit late for you to talk about it now” and stuff like that. Which in turn just made me angry again and I'd just sob, she did offer to take me for coffee and for us to talk about all this when we are sober. 

She did also admit that going to see my cousin to celebrate his engagement was low of her and that she regrets it. 

Anyway, this morning she was angry at me because of the fight last night. I asked if we could talk about it, but no. She was just snapping at me saying “No I don't want to talk”, “no leave me alone”, “no! I'm tired and angry” etc. And just walking out of the room mid-conversation (it was driving me insane). So, I followed her and asked if we could just put it to the side and enjoy our weekend and she agreed. We've been okay since then, talking normally but I'm still so angry. 

It just feels like she makes it all about her. I can't talk about something because it makes her angry, best part? It makes her angry at me. Why? Because I didn't report it when it happened?? I honestly didn't even think to, so what? I'm so upset by her reaction. 

I know her mum ignored her SA as a child and that she has been SA in relationships. So I assume she reacts this way because her trauma was swept under the rug growing up.

That being said, she's completely fine burdening me with so much of her shit and I just let her because it's healthy for her to get it out. I always have, no matter how upsetting it is I sit and listen. So, It's annoying and frustrating that she can't do the same for me. 

So yeah, am I overreacting?

Just small, non-intrusive ads that pop up in the lower-right corner of your screen and that’s it.

The concept is simple: SLICE shows you little ads in exchange for money. I use an adblocker and it still works — SLICE ads show up, but regular web ads are still blocked. So I'm actually getting paid while avoiding the usual spammy stuff from Google and other sites.

They pay out via BTC, Paypal, and gift cards.

There’s no minimum payout, but you have to wait 30 days from installing before you can withdraw (For Fraud prevention or something like that). I'm currently letting it build up and seeing where it goes.

You can also earn money with surveys, app and game rewards. Personally, I’ve just been sticking with the passive ads, but the other options are nice if you want to put in a little more time.

Would I recommend it? Honestly, yes. If you're someone who already spends time online and wants a passive side drip of income without any sketchy stuff, SLICE is pretty solid. It's not going to pay your bills, but it could easily cover a monthly coffee or two for literally doing nothing.

1kzwy0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1kzwy0a/utopia_of_the_seas_review_from_first_time_royal/,Utopia of the Seas review from first time Royal Caribbean family cruiser,"My family and I just got off Utopia of the Seas 4 night cruise from 5/26 - 5/30 out of Port Canaveral. Thought I'd share our thoughts as first-time Royal Caribbean cruisers vs our experiences on Carnival (3-time) and Disney (twice).

We're a family of 4 with myself (M/46) wife (F/46) and kids aged 16 and 13. We watched several YouTube videos of Utopia to get an idea of what we'd like to do.

**Boarding:**

I checked in at midnight the night check-in opened so I got a 10:30am time slot, nice and early. We heard the covered parking garage doesn't open until 10 so we made sure to get there right at 10. We were parked and walking into the terminal by 10:15. We brought birth certificates (not passports) and everything went really smoothly, no waiting in line for our check in time. This was the EASIEST check in experience of any cruise, ever. We stepped on the ship at 10:31am and headed straight to the Windjammer buffet.

**Dining/Food:**

We **only** ate at the Windjammer for dinners, so skip this if you're looking for specialty dinner info. Had a bad/long experience on Carnival Mardi Gras that soured us on main dining rooms for now, plus it seems like the buffets serve the same food as the MDRs, so why wait for service when I can quickly get the items ourselves? I get people want to be served and totally respect that, but our family wants to have a nice dinner together then get going to whatever show or event we scheduled without being stuck in the MDR for 2 hours.

Plus we had ""my time dining"" which turned out to only have reservations available starting around 8pm by the time I checked it? We don't really know what time we want to eat each day and I heard you can walk up to the dining rooms and get seated within 20 mins but we didn't want to deal with the hassle. We're very much the same in our home lives, we favor take out rather than sitting in a restaurant.

Carnival seems to handle dinner reservations and flexibility better in their app, you pop into the app when you're ready to eat, check yourself in, and they notify you when your table is ready. Not sure why Royal hasn't adopted this same method.

**Food quality:**

Royal's food was LIGHT YEARS ahead of Carnival's and even better than Disney in some areas. Buffet lobster tail on the first lunch? Shrimp cocktail? High end fruits (not just melons)? Bacon every day for breakfast (not just some days like Carnival) and the last day's breakfast was just as good as any other day on the cruise, whereas Carnival throws a bunch of leftovers and tells you to get the H off their ship.

Royal Caribbean takes their food and quality seriously and you can tell they take their higher cruise costs and put it into the experience. I love the hand washing stations everywhere, and the service was friendly and fast. We had people offering us water and coffee and juices and small blended smoothies (all included), all with big smiles on their faces. These people made us happy and went out of their way to make it a great experience. Also they were constantly cleaning and making sure everything looked just right. Carnival reminds me more of a 1990s buffet where there's sauces and utensils everywhere, they just clean it when the rush is over.

Oh and the Indian food!!! Every night they have a special Indian section that has some of the best Indian food I've ever had. We love getting Indian take out, and the Indian food on Utopia was better than many local Indian joints. The naan was lacking, seemed more like pita bread than naan, but the main dishes were outstanding.

They also have a charcuterie section every dinner, some kind of fresh roasted meat station, standard burgers and hot dogs and chicken fingers for those no-nonsense types, and the kids section that everyone has seen. Oh and adorable little desserts to bring back to the table for everyone to try.

The food and service level really really sets Royal apart from Carnival, it's very similar to the Disney cruises. It's like night and day compared to Carnival. Fantastic experience.

While Royal invests heavily into their main dining options, I think Carnival has them beat on the ""quick grabs"". For instance the food truck are by the pool (The Spare Tire) is fine, and always has food readily available, but it's nothing special. The food trucks on Carnival Mardi Gras seem to be taken more seriously and have better food.

Mexican food - Carnival's Blue Agave is much better than El Loco Fresh. The tortillas are more unique, and the food and toppings seem higher quality. Carnival's is open for breakfast too (breakfast burritos and tacos) whereas I didn't see El Loco Fresh having that option. Disney had nothing near the water when we went, so both Royal and Carnival have Disney beat.

**Utopia entertainment offerings:**

We saw Aqua80too (water show), All In (theater production show), and the Youtopia (ice skating show). All these shows were fantastic, and you're crazy if you don't go to see the first two at the very least. I would pay to see All In again right now, and I'm a cheapskate.

As a new Royal cruiser I didn't know there were opportunities to check into these shows before the cruise, and they were sold out quickly. However I followed the advice of a lot of people online and checked my Royal app as soon as I got onboard and on their Wifi, and I reserved our entire family into each show without a problem. I HIGHLY recommend getting these reservations because you can find much better seats and skip the long lines waiting to enter right before the show starts. It feels like going to Starbucks and skipping the long line because you ordered ahead. Seriously, the Aqua80too standby show line is like a quarter mile long.

I kind of wish we did the ship scavenger hunt because I saw a lot of families and groups having a great time doing so, but we ended up finding a fun little game show or two and even won one of them thanks to my fantastic dancing skills. Won ourselves a ""bag of crap"" from Royal Caribbean 😂

We loved going on the Ultimate Abyss slide several times, the water slides were a lot of fun (slow moving lines, but fun talking to other cruisers while we waited), and one of our nightly rituals turned out to be watching the sunset on the back of the ship (near Ultimate Abyss), then watching people on the Flowrider surf thingy. We got our drinks in hand and watched people take turns and cheering them on when they stayed upright. That was unexpected but a nice time to sit and chat, between watching Flowriders and whatever activity was happening at the sports arena.

Mini golf was cool, great lights set up and challenging holes.

Solarium adult area - Super chill vibe in this area, it's great to get away from the bumping music that is literally EVERYWHERE on this ship. We really enjoyed this area, but it kind of sucks we couldn't be with our kids. We love adult areas to slide into for a couple hours, but ultimately like spending time with our kids as a family, and as big as Utopia is, there is NO quiet place to hang out by a pool with your family. This is the loudest ship we've ever been on, and they make sure every area has it's own unique music/vibe. I LOVE music and think it's very important and I love all kinds of music, pop, rock, metal, jazz, blues, EDM, etc but I also had a headache by our 3rd night on the cruise because there's no peace anywhere outside of our room. It kind of gave us a little anxiety 😂 not being able to escape the constant thumping.

**Everything is focused on the ship rather than the sea** \- this is a unique thing about Utopia for us. There's very minimal areas where you can go and just look out at sea and ponder life. It's designed so that you almost forget you're on the water if that makes any sense? 95% of chairs on deck are pointed inwards, and there's not a lot of spots to get an easy view of the sea without turning chairs around (not even sure if that's allowed since it was rare to see). I prefer serenity with some music occasionally and this is not the ship for serenity. This is a ""turn it the F up and let's have some fun"" kind of ship. It is billed as the biggest weekend and it does that in spades. I think we'd be better suited to some older ships rather than these floating concerts. The sound quality on these speakers were **incredible**, as good as the best concerts I've ever been to. But it's like literally being at a concert for 3 or 4 days.

**Central Park** \- I thought we'd be in Central Park a lot more to chill and hang out and listen to the fake bird noises, but unfortunately we didn't. If there's a party going on at the main deck then you hear ALL the music and the DJ screaming over everyone while walking around this tranquil park. Makes no sense. At night it was better, but we'd rather be out looking at the water and feeling a breeze. So we only visited a couple times, got the beef on weck sandwich (it was amazing) and mostly left this place alone. It's really pretty though!

**Beverage package -** My wife and I stopped drinking alcohol a couple years ago because we hated hangovers and throwing days away, no judgement to anyone else just our choice. We squeezed every bit of juice out of our non-alcohol Refreshment package that included EVERYTHING without alcohol. We each had several daily lattes/cappucinos/cortados, tons of San Pellegrinos with limes on the pool deck, a bunch of zero proof drink options from the bars, some 0% beers and wine at night, and of course our souvenir Coke cups for the Coke machines.

It was really nice getting whatever we wanted wherever we went. Most of the time the bartenders didn't even scan the cards we had, they just had to see we had the refreshment package. Made things super easy.

Of course our son and daughter had to have a couple of their favorite BS Starbucks drinks which weren't covered on the package, but I knew that going in. 😆

**Hand washing culture** \- I personally love washing my hands before/after meals and I love that Royal has made it part of their culture. I returned home with the flu from Mardi Gras but so far so good after Utopia.

**Coco Cay** \- We stayed on the ship for Nassau, been there done that. We got off at Perfect Day at Coco Cay, and it was wonderful. We're the type of people that walk to the furthest thing to bypass everyone that takes the first open spot they see so we walked all the way out to the South Beach area and kept walking until the very last area that had lounge chairs and umbrellas. It was super quiet and peaceful. Our son took a 3 hour nap in a shaded hammock with roosters/chickens making the occasional noise in the background. The water was crystal clear and we got to see several large stingrays swim around us. The lunch was basic but good - chicken sandwiches, burgers, fries. Don't sleep on the mozzarella sticks! I ate my weight in watermelon and pineapple, delicious. Staff was super friendly at the bars and really everywhere we went. We also took a dip in the big pool and got a drink or two at the pool bar. Everyone around us was having a blast.

**Fellow cruisers** \- The decency of fellow cruisers on Royal is a step above that on Carnival. I'm not some stuck up jerk, I promise. It seems people on Royal Caribbean are there to have a good time but I didn't see anyone stumbling drunk and passing out and puking on the pool deck like I do so often on Carnival.

I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has, and I'll edit this post when I think of other things. Hope this helps someone!",9,1748697626.0,royalcaribbean,4,0.91,False

***WESTSIDE***\-

1. Oslo- This is a citrusy woody scent, it is fresh and rejuvenating but has that 'manly' woodiness to it (OfCourse since it's a masculine scent). The seaweed brings in the fresh aquatic quality in the opening. Despite it being a masculine scent, I could see myself wearing this because of the aquatic quality.
2. Paris- Heard so much about this on this sub, it's good but not what I had in mind. It is more floral vanilla than gourmand. There's sweetness and creaminess, but with a very prominent floral note. If you are into floral vanilla, especially jasmine, you would like this.
3. Whipped- I get the hype around this. They really got the dupe game down pat with this one, it's a dupe of SDJ 71. Creamy, sweet, and gourmand. I couldn't spray test it because they didn't have testers so I just sniffed from the bottle cap.
4. Melon Bomb- This was my absolute fav out of all tries. So good for summers, smells like muskmelon, and it's juicy and fresh. My friends and I started feeling thirsty after spraying this, since it has that fresh, juicy quality to it.

Of course, these are Westside fragrances, and the longevity leaves a lot to be desired. It barely lasts 2 hours.

***SPRITZ BY TYPSY***\-

I tried Vanilla Whispers and Cafe Noir. Vanilla Whispers PM side was damn good, the jasmine and vanilla come together so beautifully in this one. The concern here is the same as has been talked about earlier on this sub, what if I don't like the other side? And in this, I do not like the AM side, maybe it's the lavender. That's a bummer since the PM side is so good, and it lasts pretty long too, as they have 30% oil concentration.

Cafe Noir's AM side has a prominent coffee note, this is the first perfume I've tried that mentions coffee as a note and actually delivers coffee. The PM side isn't big on the coffee note, and I only like the AM side in this one.

Please note that my friend started sneezing after testing these; her eyes were a little watery too. I experienced no such issue and was completely fine. So, people who have a sensitive nose might wanna stay away.

***TOM FORD LOST CHERRY***\-

Um...nuh uh...I don't like it at all. There's a very repulsive cinnamon note and I absolutely can't stand it. I have liked cinnamon notes before, and enjoy it in Khamrah Qahwa, but the cinnamon in this is very spicy and woody, in your face. I see this as a masculine perfume through and through. The cherries and juiciness take some time to come through, but the opening threw me off.

***CHANEL CHANCE-***

1. Eau Splendide- Starts off as a very basic, fruity scent, even bubblegummy. Meh, not my thing. Nothing extraordinary.
2. Eau Fraiche- Oh, a big yes to this one. This is so fresh, eponymous to its name. The opening is zesty and citrusy, the jasmine and water hyacinth in the middle notes create a beautiful garden-like bubble. Imagine fresh flowers in the dawn adorned with morning dew. This is a perfect summer scent.

Feel free to ask anything.

Yep. Painful as the title sounds. I’ll get it out of the way, I asked him to come, he showed up, said he didn’t get me flowers because didn’t want it to be too obvious for speculation but that he wanted to and would in another time, offered to stay in touch so we exchanged contacts. Talked for a while, a couple pics, met my dad. Then I text him to let me know when he’s leaving so I can say bye, we meet again and he brought me a small handmade flower (from pipe cleaners) from the stores that was selling it. Said he couldn’t resist. I thank him again. Since I was holding a huge bouquet at the time I stuff it in with the other flowers. Bla bla next thing I know my mum said my dad left with the bouquets and that we’ll meet again for dinner. Bla bla I come home, look for the flowers to find it was gone. Tragic. Very tragic my heart dropped. 5 stages of grief. Denial: went through every tracing step my dad could’ve took as he entered the house, maybe it fell, checked the car three times and still nothing. Anger: started throwing stuff more harder in search of the flowers in the car. Bargaining did not exist. Depression: had a crash out, maybe if I stuck it in deeper, or held it separately, or told my dad watch out there’s another one inside, it’d still be here.,Acceptance: trying to move on. 

If you’ve read my other post you’ll know he also gave me flowers before, it just pains me that I can’t display the one he gave today next to that. More on the sentiment values. I could only tell my parents who it was that gave me since I’m pretty sure telling my friends would raise questions. I try to tell myself he’s just another teacher, there was so much going on today, he isn’t the center of anything. But honestly amidst all the flower bouquets I received, that small lavender flower meant so much to me. I could’ve lost all the bouquets, it still wouldn’t hurt as much as losing a singular flower he gave. Of course he doesn’t know that, and he never will. We talk about maybe meeting for coffee soon which sounds nice. I hope my efforts on trying to find it repents my mistakes. Believe me when I say I begged my dad to go back to the place even tho it was raining and almost dark. ",1,1748697440.0,TeacherCrushes,0,1.0,False

I (male 26 pansexual) have been dating my partner Alexander (mmale 28 gay) for about 4 years now. For future context, my best friend Sally (female 37 demisexual poly) was the one that bullied me into asking Alexander out and starting the whole relationship. I've had open relationships before but they were mostly exclusive just with fwb's but I've always been ok with poly relationships just never been with someone who felt the same. At the beginning of my current relationship I brought this topic up and my Alexander, said he was OK with an open relationship but it didn't feel like he meant it and was just saying it out of fear I would react negatively to him saying no (due to his trauma from previous relationships). I never acted on it, I love him and would never do anything to hurt him. 

Now fast forwarding to about a month ago. Alexander has started going out to drag shows with friends and having fun. Im not one for bright lights and loud sounds so I don't usually go along. He met a drag queen he liked, and he gained feelings for this person. This has been a huge period of discovery for him and I've tried my best to be supportive of him exploring with this individual. After a little while we have both become more comfortable with dating others and having this be a more poly/open relationship (still figuring this part out). 

Now that alexander has a 2nd partner, he's been pushing me to try finding someone. The first person he brought up was my friend, Sally. I told him that I had tried asking Sally out before we started dating to which she turned me down. She's had previous guy friends fake their friendships for the sake of trying to date her so she has some trauma with friends asking her out. I accepted that, moved on, and since then she has become my closest friend and im happy with that. Tho Alexander says that he knew I had feelings for my Sally since before we started dating and I felt awful that he knew about it because I genuinely tried to not show or acknowledge my feelings for Sally. Not that I was trying to hide my feelings from alexander, but that I was trying to hide them from myself. 

Alexander encouraged me to try asking Sally out again. He likes her as a person, they're both friendly with eachother, and he trusts her. Alexander then started telling me that he was pretty sure that Sally was interested in me. I love him and trust him so I started to believe him. And I let myself acknowledge that I have strong feelings for Sally. Then he started to bully me into asking her out (go figure).

So I did. I went out with Sally for coffee and I told her that and before I could ask her, she just let out a scarred ""please don't."" Of course we changed subject, then as we were leaving it felt like there was a wall between us. Said a quick ""bye"" and she drove off quickly which was not the norm. 

I feel like in an instant I had broken all the trust between me and Sally. I feel like I just threw away our friendship. And that she hates me for it.

It's been about week since then. Alexander has been nothing but supportive of me after a rejection but it's not just that... it feels like he's ignoring the fact that he urged me to do it. 

Now I feel like I've lost trust in Alexander. Like I can't talk to him about my feeling cuz when I listened to him, things went wrong. And I can't talk to Sally about my feelings cuz it's about her and I'm scarred it would be hard on her too.

I feel like a wedge has been put between me  and alexander and between me and Sally. And idk what to do or who to talk to...

If you're this far, thank you for reading my vent.

I’m using a Sage Bambino and usually pull a proper double shot in the morning — add milk, make a flat white or whatever, all good.

But later in the day, if I fancy another coffee and *really* can’t be bothered to grind and prep again… I’ll just hit the single or double shot program and run it through the same used puck.

Yeah, I know — it’s pretty watery and nowhere near as good. But I tend to top it with boiling water anyway for something like an americano-style drink, so the fact that it's weaker doesn't really bother me.

Does anyone else do this? Any thoughts on squeezing more than one shot from a single puck / dose of grounds? I know it's not ""proper"" espresso but I’m curious if I’m alone in this lazy shortcut or if others are doing similar.

1kzwovx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITPhilippines/comments/1kzwovx/fraud_alert_campf_cloud_mentoring_program/,Fraud Alert: CAMPF Cloud Mentoring Program,"Hindi ko na matiis, need na maexpose itong mentoring program na ito na parang kulto ang pamamalakad imbes na tech group at pure pera lang at fraud.

I was recruited months ago sa CAMPF (Cloud Architecture Mentoring Philippines Foundation) ng officemate  na gustong mag upskill sa Cloud. Balak kong kasing mag upskill sa cloud tech for my current role na  (IT related din). So kinontak ko yung mentor na si Cruise Lim (true name pala is Ferdinand Lim) na laging nagpopost sa IT Philippines sa FB about sa mga passers niya sa AWS Cloud Pract, tinanong ko if paano magenroll at ano mode of learning. Sabi niya is iba daw ito sa mga traditional training at malalaman nalang daw namin if nakapasok na, meaning need magbayad ng  3K.

Nagdadalawang isip na ako that time parang napaka mysterious naman at hindi masearch credentials ni mentor kasi iba pinapakilala na name niya para sana masearch ko credentials. Pero nakumbinse ako ng kaibigan ko kaya nagenroll ako. Tapos tong si mentor, nagsend ng mga napakadaming pdf files and links ng mga YouTube tutorials about cloud basta basahin at panoorin daw namin. Nagtaka na ako noon bakit ganun haha!

So nag attend ako ng 3 sessions, at ito mga kakaibang rule.

1. Dapat nakaformal attire lagi.
2. Pag tatawagin mo siya dapat laging may mentor lagi at pagsasabihan ka niya. Minsan natawag ko siya na sir, pinagsabihan niya ako haha!
3. Dapat call your classmates din as mentees. Ang OA
4. Now, after 3 sessions nag uupsell na yan sa full mentorship na hindi ko alam na may ganun, kala ko 3k is full na yun. Sinabi niya intro lang daw yung at yung full program is worth 65K para makuha benefits ng CAMPF like on demand learning and community support at tutulungan Kang pumasa sa exam. Tapos lagi niyang sinasabi na close niya si Diwa Del Mundo ng ApperPH at si Jon Bonso, pinapakita pa niya mga PM niya sa kanila na kamessage niya. Sinasabi din niya na Mason siya at hindi siya pwedeng sitahin sa traffic.

Ako naman napapayag ulit ng kaibigan ko kasi merong installment naman daw na option na 5K per month. So nagenroll ako by paying first 5K at yun naiadd ako sa official Viber group haha! Tangina kala ko may platform ang CAMPF as promise pero ViberGroup ang official channel nila. Isang GC sa General Discussion, another GC sa Tech Talks, another GC sa Exam Booking, and the most important sa mentors is GC for Bank Transfers ng payments. Haha!

Two way ang mentoring nila kuno.

1. Need mo mag attend ng F2F training sa office nila kung guess what kung nasa? Sa Coffee Project Shaw! Haha! Yup yung nakikita niyo na pinopost nila na picture. Hindi siya conducive for learning kasi malakas music doon. Tapos ang ginagawa lang nila, prinoproject sa screen nila yung old presentation ng AWS materials na galing din sa internet at very outdated na din yung mga info, hindi man lang nila maupdate. Kung wala slang slide material literal ng mga FAQ ang binabasa nila literally sa AWS site.

Tapos mas madami pang kwentong barbero ni Cruise kesa sa actual na tech discussion. Pinapaabot nila ng lunch time kaait wala ng madiscuss pero hindi sila nagpapalunch kahit ang mahal mahal ng bayad.

2. On demand videos - dito talaga malaking budol kasi akala ko may platform talaga sila like CloudSchool pero ang binigay sa amin is shared accounts sa Udemy, Whizlab, at Tutorial Dojo hahaha! Tapos ginagawa nila, nagpapalit sila ng password monthly para yung mga hindi nagbabayad eh hindi magagamit yung accounts. Pinagyayabang pa nila na madami daw silang biniling accounts kala mo naman very special.

Kung malaman lang sana ni Jon Bonso na ginagamit platform niya sa fraud at pinagkakakitaan.

In terms sa mentor, hindi talaga sila nakakatulong sa discussion since mostly sumasagot sa tech query (kung meron man kasi takot masita mga mentees na kulang pa sa Aral ) eh mga mentees din na nag-aaral at minsan kung sumagot man si Cruise eh balagbag pa or sarcastic like mag-aral kasi ng mabuti at makinig sa mentor imbes na sagutin yung tech query. 

Guilt mentoring yung style niya at hambog like lagi niya sinasabi na be humble always at sumunod sa mentor (like sa cult) , pero lagi niyang sinasabi na Mason siya at hindi siya pwedeng sitahin ng enforcer. Lagi niyang sinasabi din na nakaBMW siya (mas mahal pa ata yung sasakyan ng mga mentees na iba) haha!

Eto pa, yung mga pinopost niyang testimony, hindi yun voluntary, kasi nagpapasubmit siya nun required after makapasa sa cloud prac (salamat kay jon bonso). Kapag hindi ka nagbigay ng testimony eh wawarningan ka niya.

At eto pa, need niyo din magcongratulate sa mga pinopost niya sa IT Philippines kundi lagot ka ulit.

At eto pa, kahit sinong papasok pinapatos niya, walang filtering like active duty na sundalo na hindi alam maglaptop, masahista, and etc. Hindi naman sa pang aano pero aminin natin, mahirap na silang makahabol sa tech pero tinatanggap parin niya kasi magbabayad ng 3K para matry. Sa mga bootcamp nga eh may skill na need minimum bago ka iapprove.

Yung sa GC pala, walang silbi din kasi mostly good morning lang usapan at welcome sa mga bagong pasok, tapos pag hindi ka active sa pag goodmorning or welcome eh tinatanggal ka sa GC kahit bayad ka at need mo mag apologize sa pagiging inactive.

Basta wag na kayoing mabiktima, pera pera lng yung mentoring program at kasi original payment scheme is 5k per month, tinaas ni cruise sa 10k per month para makabyad ka na bago marealize na fraud.

Sa cloud school nang kayo or sa tutorial dojo. Hindi worth it yung 65K (nagtaas na daw at my retainership fee na 400 n daw per month kahit fully paid) haha!",2,1748696874.0,ITPhilippines,0,1.0,False

I’ve been titrating Elvanse: started with 30mg for a week, then 50mg for 3 weeks, and due to try 70mg soon. My prescriber is open to adding a booster later in the day, since I tend to crash hard around 7pm.

Elvanse has definitely helped with the racing thoughts and improved my ability to concentrate. A big benefit has been energy regulation, I have hypothyroidism and it’s been incredible not feeling constantly fatigued for once. Side effects have been minimal: a bit of appetite suppression, and occasionally I feel like I’ve had one too many coffees (only drinking decaff since meds).

That said, I’m torn. I don’t feel like my ADHD is “severe”. I’ve had a relatively successful, functional life without meds, just... harder. People around me were surprised I even pursued a diagnosis. So it feels strange to be moving to the highest dose. When I mentioned that to my prescriber, they asked if I felt there was still room for improvement, and sure, I guess the answer is always yes?

But I’m unsure what the “ideal” dose or medication is supposed to feel like.
Also, does anyone else worry about long-term use, like becoming too dependent on meds or somehow less capable without them over time? Is that even a thing?

Would really appreciate hearing from others who’ve gone through similar titration journeys, how did you know when you’d found the right mess, dose or combo?

## Key Features Analysis

A good bubble waffle maker should be easy to use, heat up quickly, and produce evenly cooked waffles with the perfect texture. Several key features contribute to the overall quality and performance of a bubble waffle maker.

**Heating Element:** A powerful and efficient heating element is crucial for even cooking and consistent results.

The Best bubble waffle makers utilize dual heating elements, one each for the top and bottom plates. This ensures the batter is cooked evenly from both sides, preventing burning or undercooking.The heating element should also be able to reach the desired temperature quickly, ideally within 2-3 minutes, minimizing waiting time and ensuring a continuous flow of waffle production. Look for heating elements with a power rating of at least 1000 watts for optimal performance.

**Non-Stick Coating:** A high-quality non-stick coating is essential for preventing waffles from sticking and making cleanup a breeze.

Some models feature a locking mechanism to secure the plates in place during rotation, preventing spills and ensuring safety.

**Temperature Control:** Adjustable temperature settings provide greater control over the cooking process.

The Ability to adjust the temperature allows you to customize the cooking process to your preferences.Lower temperatures result in softer, more pliable waffles, while higher temperatures produce crispier, more golden results. Temperature control is especially important when using different types of batter or adding ingredients like chocolate chips or fruit. Look for models with a wide temperature range, typically from 200°F to 400°F, and clear, easy-to-read temperature markings.

**Material and Build quality:** The overall construction and materials used determine the durability and longevity of the waffle maker.

The best bubble waffle makers are constructed from high-quality materials such as stainless steel or cast aluminum. These materials are durable, heat-resistant, and easy to clean. The handles should be made of heat-resistant material and provide a comfortable grip. The overall build quality should be solid and sturdy, without any flimsy parts or loose connections.A well-built waffle maker will withstand frequent use and last for many years.

**Deep waffle Pockets:** Deeper molds create fuller,more satisfying bubble waffles.Look for bubble waffle makers that offer deep waffle pockets, as this is essential to create the classic bubble waffle appearance. This offers the ability for more toppings,and the batter won't spill when closed.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1748696685.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I thought that I may not even share this on reddit. Because I did this for me. Yet it was always a dream for me to own one since 2011. And maybe somebody else will be motivated to go through this themselves.

So I got a 2021 GS/3 AV used in stainless steel on a secondary market. It was used for customers at non-coffee business. Like a dealership. So The machine did not get much use. About 10000 shots were made on it when I connected to it via app. Which is about 10 shots per day for 3 years.

The bad thing was that it was pretty scratched up. Good thing is that they used BWT water filtration system. I tested that system on site and the water had TDS of about 100. So pretty good. The machine was otherwise in good shape. Just cosmetically scratched and abused. It was also great that it already had IOT module installed. So I made an offer and it was accepted.

I always dreamt of owning one of the specht machines. But I thought I could try to do it myself. Because I can’t drop €10k on a machine. Here is a list of mods:

- custom white gloss powdercoat - done locally. I asked the powdercoaster to match the stock white color of my white LM Micra. They nailed it
- custom oak wood panels.I sourced the oak wood locally. shaping was done by local carpenter who built my kitchen
- oak AV cover - designed, 3D printed by me and made by fellow redditor from solid oak
- oak steam wand handle - designed, 3D printed by me and made by fellow redditor from solid oak
- brass feet and side panel nuts - wowa design ordered online
- brass la marzocco logo - ordered from grafikus
- oak bottomless portafilter - ordered from grafikus
- disassembly, small adjustments of OPV, gasket replacement and cleaning, assembly - myself

It’s not super custom, but it looks like i dreamed. It matches my EK43 Icon. I also learned to work on espresso machines a bit. And pushed myself outside my comfort zone.

Hope you guys like it. See my profile for progress pics. It was a 6 month process.

I never thought I’d be standing on that mountain, ready to jump.  

The wind was cold. My heart was numb. For months, I’d been drowning—in guilt, in loneliness, in the crushing weight of feeling like a failure. I knew Allah was there, but I couldn’t feel Him. I hadn’t prayed in years. I was just… empty.  

The Breaking Point
One night, I had a dream so vivid it shook me awake in a sweat.  

I was in a prison cell. The guards dragged me out, and I heard the words: “Execution at dawn.""No appeals, no last-minute reprieve. My time was up.  

And then it hit me— *hard*.  

“You were born Muslim. You *know* the truth. But you wasted it. You never even *tried*.""*  

I woke up gasping, my heart pounding like it was trying to escape my chest. For the first time in years, I *felt* something—**fear**. Not just of death, but of standing before Allah with *nothing* to show for my life.  

### **The First Step Back**  

The next day, I forced myself to pray. Just *one* prayer. My body resisted like it was made of lead. My mind screamed: *""You’ve missed so many—what’s the point now?""*  

But I did it anyway.  

And then I added **two simple habits that changed everything**:  

1. **Morning Quran**: Even just *one ayah* with my coffee. Slowly, the words started to sink into my heart.  
2. **Istighfar (Astaghfirullah) all day**: Every time I felt anxious, guilty, or distracted—*100x a day*.  

### **The Miracles Started Small**  


- **The Exam I Should’ve Failed:** I walked into a test I hadn’t studied for, whispered *""Bismillah,""* and somehow *passed*.  
- **The Job That Fell Into My Lap:** A company I barely knew called me out of the blue. A 15-minute interview later, I had a job.  

But the *real* miracle? **The weight lifting from my chest**. The more I recited Quran in the mornings and said istighfar, the *lighter* I felt. Like Allah was wiping my slate clean, day by day.  

### **Where I Am Now**  
It wasn’t overnight. Some days, I still fight my nafs. But now:  
- **I pray not out of guilt, but *love***  
- **The haram I craved? It lost its grip**  
- **The anxiety that choked me? Replaced with *sakina* (tranquility)**  

If He could save *me*—someone who’d ignored Him for years—He *will* save you too.  

**Start small. Beg Him at Tahajjud. Try morning Quran + istighfar. Watch what happens.**  

*You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to turn to Him.*

1kzwk7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1kzwk7l/vintage_photo_restoration/,Vintage Photo Restoration,"When it comes to diving into the world of digitizing and restoring old photos, it feels a bit like stepping into the emotional time capsule of our lives—don’t you think? There’s nothing quite like the moment when you pop open a dusty box of faded family photographs, revealing a kaleidoscope of memories. It’s like a treasure hunt, and let me tell you, some of those finds could make for great stories over a cup of coffee (or maybe a stronger beverage if the photo was particularly embarrassing).

Digitizing these gems is not just about preserving them from the ravages of mildew or, heaven forbid, the accidental spilled coffee—though that is a major perk. It’s about capturing the essence of those moments, the laughter, the tears, and, yes, maybe even that questionable haircut your uncle rocked in the ‘80s. These aren’t just pictures; they’re windows into family history, lessons learned, and love shared. Plus, with a little digital magic, those faded colors can burst back to life, and suddenly, Grandma doesn’t look like she just stepped out of a black-and-white film.

Now, if you're looking to market this service, family history groups are a goldmine. These folks are passionate about preserving their legacies, and they’re often on the lookout for ways to securely archive their family treasures. A carefully crafted message that highlights your dedication to preserving their memories—complete with a warm invitation to share their nostalgic stories—can resonate deeply. Sharing success stories, maybe even a hilarious anecdote about how one photo revealed Cousin Ed's true love for mustaches, can build trust and encourage engagement. After all, who doesn’t love a good family saga?

And don’t overlook the power of partnering with local archives or libraries. These institutions are often the guardians of community history, and they appreciate the importance of preserving not only their collections but also the unique stories of the families within the community. Imagine hosting a workshop together where you demonstrate your fancy photo restoration skills, showing attendees how to resurrect their own photos, all while mingling with local history aficionados. What better way to create connections than through shared memories and the kind of laughter that reminds you how we’re all part of this intertwined tapestry of human experience?

In all this, it’s about more than just business; it’s a call to build a community where stories are shared, memories are cherished, and faith in the enduring power of family connections is revitalized. It invites us to say “yes” to archiving our heritages and, who knows, maybe even discovering a little divine purpose while we’re at it. So, gather those old photos, breathe life into them, and let’s embark on this beautiful journey of restoration together.",1,1748696489.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

But anyways !! WELLLLLL Firstly Atrioc messaged me on discord and I was SO excited to see that notification. ""Wow! This is my chance"" I thought to myself. ""I can finally make our friendship mutual!"" so I opened up the dm and i was greeted with his request for me to model ""the coffee cow""! Obviously I wasn't going to say no! I got to work right away, and it came out great!   


 And then, another message came. ""Hey, Bluejay. That looks great! I, the glizzmeister, will gift you 100 glizzys for this excellent creation!""     


""G-glizzies?""  I replied. (up to this point, I've done more conventional modelling work and was used to being paid in usd ) ""Oh! haha! Good one, my friend, brandon! (at this point, I had assumed me and Atrioc had formed some type of bond, so I felt comfortable calling him by his real name.... this was a wrong assumption. ) Quite the jokester! Don't worry. Just $10 or so is fine! ""  


""Brandon? YOU WILL ADDRESS ME AS LORD GLIZZY, YOU MUSTARD-HEAD!"" I was shocked. Truly shocked, I guess this is what they mean when they say ""never meet your heroes""... but thankfully he added at the end (although in a whisper) ""but we are friends by the way""   


""Okay, Lord Glizzy. My apologies, Sir Humblest of the Condiments. "" I replied, hastily, in hopes of mending the damage I had dealt to our friendship.   


""WELLLLLLLLLL, I GUESS it's alright. I shall require another one of your models to grace the glizzy kingdom. Next shall be the football ferret! I need this made right now, so that it can accrue the required number of upvotes to appear on the reddit recap! For it, I will grace you with 200 Glizzys!"" Atrioc said, while munching on golden grahams. I couldn't see this, since the conversation was over text--but I'm still pretty sure he was.  


Slightly relieved by his usage of his iconic ""WELLLLLLLLL"" catch-phrase, my face lightens a bit. ""Right now, Lord Glizzy? I have yet to get a single winkage of sleepeth! And 200 Glizzies? If possible, I would like to be paid in usd...""   


""EXSQUEEEEEEZE ME! Are you seriously complaining about your payment???""  


I was shocked, but not appalled or annoyed--I recognized that we had a difference in culture, upbringing, and even country of residence. For the Glizzard Wizard, it's very possible he thought 200 glizzies was a good price, so I reluctantly accepted  


After slaving away for days with no sleep, I finished! Just in time! But then... I got... another dm.   


""WELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL. Good job, Young Glizzy! It looks excellent! Fo your next job...""  


My... next job? Upon reading this part of the message, I froze. Another... Job? He might be my close friend and all, but at this point I hadn't slept in days... I really wanted to sleep.  


""Uh, Glizzy Lord. I'm sorry.. but-""   


I was in the middle of typing, until my eyes glazed over his message again ""and for this, your payment shall be a 5 hour paper mario stream!""   


As soon as I saw this, I deleted the message I had been drafting and immediately got to work!   


And well, here we are... I don't know what the Glizzy Lord is going to have me make next... but I just hope I'm allowed  some sleep beforehand...",37,1748696306.0,atrioc,1,1.0,False
1kzwht2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmiInTheWrong/comments/1kzwht2/am_i_in_the_wrong/,Am I in the wrong?,"I'm going to apologize in advance, this may be a bit hard to follow and it's going to be lengthy. 

\*\*\*// Some context: my boyfriend (35M) and I (35F) have been together for 15 years. When we first started dating, we were young and I had self esteem issues. I was very insecure and would get jealous when he talked to other girls (in my partial defense, he had asked me if I'd be open to a threesome a few months after we started dating, which did not help my insecurities). He was friends with a girl at the time that made me really insecure and so he stopped talking to her. I've grown a lot over the years, I have more self esteem than I used to and I've since learned that you can have platonic friendships with the opposite sex while being in a relationship. //\*\*\*

I always had male friends, but when my boyfriend and I started dating, I stopped hanging out with them. Unfortunately I was one of those girls who had more guy friends than girls, which ended up leaving me pretty isolated until recently. 

\*\*\*// More context: Last year the company I work for hired a man (let's call him Pedro) who spoke mainly spanish. One day he asked for my help to make arrangements to have his cat spayed (he had been trying for months but struggled with the language barrier) and I just so happen to work with a rescue that offers low-cost spay and neuter services so I was able to help and from there, we quickly became friends. He would often invite my boyfriend and I over for dinner and my boyfriend always turned down the invitations, so I'd go alone. One time Pedro asked if I could go down and help him at the hospital, his daughter was in need of care but he was having trouble communicating with the nurses. I explained the situation to my boyfriend and asked if he wanted to join me, he said no so I went alone. //\*\*\*

Now, I don't know what's in the air/water lately, but I've had multiple guy friends (and others) show romantic interest in me in the past month. With that said, I'm a very empathetic person (I always put myself in the other person's shoes), so when someone tries to initiate something romantic, I try to let them down easy. If they compliment me, I thank them for the compliment. I also mention my boyfriend in subtle ways so it doesn't become an awkward situation. For example, one guy friend who expressed interest (let's call him John) asked if we could hangout sometime, I told him that I sleep during the day and since my boyfriend and I work different shifts (he works days, I work evenings), we don't see each other at all during the week, so I try as much as possible to reserve my weekends to spend time with him. I went on to say that my vacation time is coming up soon and if he wanted to get a coffee or something, we could do something then. He went on to say that he didn't want to cause any trouble with my boyfriend, to which I told him that we've been together for 15 years and don't hide anything from each other, and that my boyfriend trusts me.

\*\*\*// More (more) context: I leave facebook open on my computer 24/7, including while I'm at work. My boyfriend doesn't have facebook so he sometime uses messenger on my account to talk to his friends (with my permission). With that said, I have nothing to hide on my account. //\*\*\*

 Now, this past week, two things happened:

1. I was contacted on messenger by one of my brother's co workers (let's call him Derek). Apparently my brother had been talking to him about me (I'm not sure what was said), and he was interested in getting to know me. We talked a bit back and forth and he did make several flirty comments (he mentioned that he made a joke to my brother saying that if Derek were to start dating me that they'd be family). Like with John, I brought up my boyfriend in a subtle way to defuse the situation without making things awkward. 

2. I started talking to one of my co workers on messenger (let's call him Mike), we recently became friends at work. He complimented me a couple of times saying that I'm pretty, and I thanked him. We continued on to talk about normal friend stuff (our other co workers, interesting stuff going on in our lives atm, our pets etc). Pretty harmless overall (at least I thought so).

Yesterday morning my boyfriend confronted me, asking if there was anything I wanted to tell him. Confused, I asked him what he meant. He went on to say that he was talking to one of his friends on messenger and he saw parts of my conversations with Derek and Mike. He said that from what he saw, I didn't seem to reciprocate their feelings, but it still left doubt in his mind and he INSISTED that I sit there and read him both conversations in full, and not just that, he also wanted me to read through every conversation that I've had in the past year with any man that's not family. I was blown away, I couldn't help but laugh, which only made him more upset, saying that I wasn't taking this seriously and that if we reversed the roles, that I'd be upset too. I humored him and I read through the conversations, one by one. I couldn't help but shoot him a dirty look as I read my comment to John about how my boyfriend and I have no secrets and that he trusts me. Some of the other conversations were with good friends that I talk to a lot so I was reading for close to two hours before he decided that he was satisfied and had seen/heard enough to be convinced that I wasn't hiding anything. 

I said that I was sorry for making him think that I was cheating, but I'm allowed to have friends of the opposite sex. He then threw in my face the girl he stopped being friends with 15 years ago, basically saying that I'm being a hypocrite (which I do get where he's coming from). I told him that I've changed a lot since then and realize now that that was toxic behavior. He said that he's fine with me having guy friends but if I want to make any plans to hang out with them, I should invite him to join us. Which generally speaking, I wouldn't have a problem with, but as I've mentioned above, I've invited him to several outings with guy friends in the past and he's always said no.

Mike has since asked me if I'd like to hangout sometime, and I was honest with him. I told him that my boyfriend and I got into an argument after he saw parts of our conversation and that if we wanted to hangout I would have to invite him to join us. I wasn't sure how he'd feel about that, I know some people aren't big on the idea of being a ""third wheel"".. but to my surprise he said he is totally okay with my boyfriend joining us. So everything seems to be fine..? but I'm still not sure how I feel about the whole situation. Part of me is angry that after 15 years together, he doesn't trust me more than that (he says that he trusts me but after reading my inbox out loud to him, I'm not so sure)..

1kzwbbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1kzwbbl/aita_for_kicking_someone_out_of_the_family/,AITA for kicking someone out of the family?,"I (32F) have a cousin (31F, let’s call her Kate), who is a married to a guy for one year (24M fake name Joe), who lied to her for months about joining the army, and has cheated on her multiple times in the past. We have a big blended group of family members (cousins + spouses) that is fairly close and spend time together like we’re best friends, bbqs, holidays, trips, birthdays, etc. 

Recently, her husband’s mistress blew up their secret relationship of a year by contacting one of the cousins through Facebook after seeing her in tagged pics (let’s call her Jane) and told her “woman to woman, someone needs to tell Kate this man is a master manipulator and tell her, because now that I know, no one should be with him the way he treated me like he loved me and she needs to know the truth”. Mistress had receipts, photos, stories of holidays they spent together, the woman was in love. Before Jane confronted Kate, she asked me to tell Kate with her, because she was scared that Kate wouldn’t take the news well and would turn the story on its side. Well, Kate listened, learned the truth, cried it out with us… and when she confronted Max— she took him back. 

After she told us they would work on it, I told Kate she could do whatever she wanted but he wouldn’t be welcome into my house again. The timing was just fresh after Christmas, where he came late to my holiday party, we learned because he was with his mistress for dinner earlier. This also wasnt the first time of cheating I knew about and I looked past the earlier incidents because it wasn’t my life. But now I know too much. I showed kindness to him, welcomed him in my house, let him carry my children in his arms, prepared plates of meals for him, gave him the chair to sit in from under me (hosting parties is a big deal for me). 

What I said spiraled into her saying she won’t come around if he wasn’t invited because they’re a “package deal”. After a year of inviting her (only) to bbqs, birthdays, weddings, family events, shes rejected mine and everyone else’s invitation because he isn’t invited/welcome. I’ve even invited her to lunch and coffee with just us to talk 1-1 and she declines saying she doesn’t want to talk about her relationship, and when I said we can have a relationship/friendship outside your marriage she stops replying. I stopped inviting her. She blocked everyone on Facebook and instagram and a part of me feels like her husband did it. 

I wish I didn’t know any of this. Sometimes a part of me is like, will this ever end? She won’t communicate, won’t put in effort, and in her eyes thinks Jane and I iced her out and kicked her out of the family for her relationship. It hurts because we are family and genuinely has a connection that transcends normal friendship. If you’ve ever been close with your cousins you might understand that. Truly I just can’t stand him. Am I justified for saying he’s not welcome? AITA? ",6,1748695737.0,TwoHotTakes,6,0.88,False

Context: I'm in my 20s and currently in a relationship. Both partner (M, 20s) and I are working in the same company holding the same position, we each know our salaries and both of us are aware of our financial capabalities as we are both from lower middle-class bracket.

He mentioned I should talk to my therapist because he noticed my anxiety gets really high and I shut down. And If we don’t catch it fast enough I’m spiraling for a good week.

1. Minimize stressors. Job, friends, family, hobbies, anything. Take a hard look at them. No matter how happy these things make you and no matter how important they are, if they stress you out, you need to cut them out, like your life depends on it, because it does. You cannot empty your stress tank if someone else keeps filling it back up. That's how you end up laying in bed tired but wired and unable to sleep. Some of these things you can not change, that makes it even more neccessary to be radical and unforgiving on the others.
2. Zero caffeine. Your morning coffee may give you the energy you need to do stuff, but it's not worth it! The coffee you had yesterday morning is still making you tense today, your body needs a long time to fully process it. Your sleep suffers, but more imporantly, your ability to relax suffers, you're always tense, always on the go. Caffeine has to go.
3. Manage other drugs. Nicotine and alcohol are not great but if you don't consume them regularly you should be okay. Opiates, amphetamines and all other strong drugs are terrible, not worth it. Marijuana or psychedelics on the other hand can probably help you relax if you find the right dose, can't really speak on those too much. 
4. Meditation. You don't need to meditate every day but it is a good idea to learn the basics, maybe try some guided meditations. It's an important skill that can calm you down in lots of different situations.
5. Reduce distractions. If you read Reddit or watch Youtube or listen to audio books all day, you can't feel yourself and won't even notice when you are stressed out. You need to be okay with silence.
6. Manage worries about cfs. Watch recovery stories on Youtube, join a self help group, talk to others with the condition. Worrying about your condition will stress you out, getting other perspectives can help a lot with that. Maybe even inspire hope. Ideally you will learn to accept your current state and go from there.
7. Manage other worries. Some thoughts just won't leave you alone, even if they are not actually that important, they can be stressful. If meditating doesn't help, you might want to try Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. There are free resources on the internet, you don't have to have a therapist to work on this.

Hey fellow off-gridders,  
  
Been living off-grid for 3+ years now and finally cracked the code on shelf-stable nutrition that doesn't suck. Thought I'd share what's been working.  
  
The Problem:\*\* Most ""survival foods"" taste like cardboard and cost a fortune from tactical/prepper sites.  
  
The Solution: Found 5 organic options on Amazon Prime that are:  
\- Shelf-stable for months without refrigeration  
\- Nutrient-dense (important when you can't just run to the store)  
\- Way cheaper than specialty off-grid retailers  
\- Actually taste good  
  
What's been working:  
  
🔸 \*Chia seeds (2lb bag)\* - Stupid versatile. Add to water for hydration + nutrients. 3-year shelf life sealed.  
  
🔸 \*Plant-based protein bars\* - Don't melt in summer heat like other bars. Clean ingredients, no weird preservatives.  
  
🔸 \*Organic snack variety packs\* - Portion control matters when resupply is limited. Kids love them too.  
  
🔸 \*Ceylon cinnamon\* - Makes basic staples (oatmeal, coffee) way more palatable. Anti-inflammatory bonus.  
  
🔸 \*Ready-to-drink nutrition shakes\* - Backup nutrition when solar cooking isn't an option.  
  
Real talk: Living off-grid doesn't mean eating poorly. These have been game-changers for my nutrition without breaking the bank or requiring special storage.  
  
Anyone else found good long-term food solutions that work off-grid? 

Always looking for new ideas.

I love meeting new people, I’m currently applying for jobs (it was an unexpected move), and I don’t drink (however, I am an ex-bartender and do find certain bars/etc relaxing at times). 

Cool coffee shops, other places to check out, meditation groups, book clubs, soccer games (I used to play, now I try to stay relatively in shape with the gym), etc - I’m down for whatever! I also love swimming/outdoor activities if that helps with ideas. ",9,1748694075.0,Marietta,9,1.0,False

I have been traveling alone for a few months now and this is my first time “living” alone. I love it. I can spend my time however I want without judgment and mind you I have created some weird habits for myself unfortunately. Anyways, before I loop back home I have said I would go see some of my family members for two weeks and then some more for a week. This would obviously save me so much money but I am finding that I am seriously dreading it and I’m thinking the following issues are my reasons. I HATE being bored. I fill my days to the brim but in a productive and not overstimulating way. For example, I set time blocks for cleaning, grocery shopping, journaling, etc. so I never have to”down time” during the day but the tasks aren’t miserable tasks, they’re things i want to do. My family likes to talk, play cards, watch tv, and virtually do nothing for hours and that makes me literally feel like i’m freaking out. I also have a “weird” diet to them and I feel very guilty and I don’t like to impose. I have coffee every morning the same way but I use a blender to froth my milk and I worry this would be annoying and just the idea of me being in the kitchen for 30 minutes making sure everything is “just so” with my breakfast alone. Idk. I am getting very overwhelmed but also wondering if this is a good push to just FORCE me out of my weird habits I’ve created. I take a very very long time preparing and consuming my meals as well. It’s freakish. :(",1,1748693698.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
