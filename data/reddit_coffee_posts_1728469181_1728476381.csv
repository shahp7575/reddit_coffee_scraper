1fzq0de,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1fzq0de/season_7_thoughts_from_someone_whos_watched_4/,Season 7 thoughts from someone who's watched 4 episodes (not in order),"So, I've been a mess lately and can't focus, as a result my rewatch has consisted of me just jumping around the show and watching whatever episode feels right.

For context: I've never finished season 6 nor have I ever made it to season 7. I have, however, watched certain episodes because watching the downfall of Christopher and Lorelai's marriage gives me a major serotonin boost. 

The car shopping episode with Luke and Lorelai arguing about his blood pressure and how he gets like that when he's hungry? Old married couple energy right there. The bathroom tiles were so unnecessary to bring up and I love that they reopened this argument. That was not very ""we've moved passed our relationship and feelings for each other"" of them.

But, I digress, let's talk about my very uninformed thoughts of season 7.

Thisv includes thoughts on Rory's love life, Christopher being a mess, Lorelai being Lorelai, and Luke being Luke.

Logan and Rory are top tier and no one can change my mind. Definition of ""if he wanted to, he would"". The way he borrowed a whole helicopter because Richard was in the hospital and then dealt with the COD JOKE from the fish guy 🥰. Not to mention the fact that he was so calm about Rory having a crush on the TA bc it happens when Jess probably would've gotten defensive and later seasons Dean would have lost it. Adult relationship was adult relationshiping.

That was not a love letter, Christopher, it was a perfectly good character reference. You only got so insecure because it pointed out how you weren't there when Luke was. Things like this are why you guys don't work. She can't coddle you all the time, she needs a partner. 

Lorelai putting all that effort into the doggy memorial was great. 10/10 friendship moment. 

Lorelai and Sookie'sb conversation about Christopher is actually really great and the way Sookie went about talking to her and asking her the ""would it still be Christopher"" was an amazing moment because that was exactly what Lorelai needed to hear. 

I'd Rather Be In Philadelphia might be one of the greatest episodes of the show. Hands down.

The fact it isn't just Lorelai and Rory who respond that way to Luke's coffee 🥰. Seriously, Chris got jump scared by how awesome his wife's ex fiance's coffee making skills are. That had to be intimidating.

Christopher turning off his phone when he has a wife and two daughters was not okay and I can't forgive that. You don't turn off your phone when you have those kinds of responsibilities, what if something happened to GiGi and his mother couldn't get in contact with him? Common Chris L, but worse than usual. 

Lorelai babysitting was so sweet and cute. Jackson not getting snipped and not telling Sookie was not so sweet and cute. 

Emily and Richard had me in a chokehold and all emotional. Richard hating Philadelphia is so on point.

Everything about Christopher and Lorelai's divorce gives me happy chemicals. I literally just turned those ones on a while back so I could feel something when I tried watching season 6.

Luke bringing fish sticks was almost as romantic as the Santa burger, and anyone who knows me knows how much I adore the Santa burger scene. 

The fact Luke set it up so Lorelai could get a newer engine for her old car so she wouldn't have to buy a new one despite thinking it was insane was an instant classic.

*Insert Victoria Justice meme*

I think we ALL want Lorelai's dress that she wore when she finally went into Luke's again.

I think that's all, might add more later. 

Any recommendations on episodes to watch from season 6 and season 7? I genuinely don't think I can watch them all the way through in order.",1,1728476254.0,GilmoreGirls,0,1.0,False

If you get it right, you'll find the taste and mouthfeel is very close to creamed coffee.

1fzpzqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1fzpzqi/how_to_correct_new_behavior_in_our_dog_shes/,How to correct new behavior in our dog (she's become obsessed with grandma's treats...)?,"We've been visiting family for 6 days and my dog feels irreparably changed

This is a bit of a vent, rant, general airing of frustration. There is a request for advice on what to do at the end too.

Our Shiba is 1 year old. She's the dream. Incredibly calm, quiet and gentle. Super polite with strangers (although she sort of orbits them for treats...). She likes to cuddle and sleep with us, she never barks at anything outside. The only times she makes noise is: 1 bark if somethings wrong to get our attention, a tiny whine when she wants our food, or a weird Demon monkey scream when we're wrestling. She likes her own space and will happily go into rooms alone to nap for hours. She loves long walks, lying in the park and observing dogs for hours, and playing games. She loves coffee shops and getting pup cups, and knows all her routes and routines. 

But we've moved. We left our apartment and traveled for 4 days by train & car to stay with family. On the travel days she was a champion. She slept for an entire 5 hour train trip. On the 2 days of driving she got a little anxious and stressed, but remained calm. In the hotels she went a bit ballistic with pent up energy; every towel, bed and person in the room got wrestled and jumped on.

When we arrived at our destination,  she was ecstatic. She ran laps of the new giant yard she has to explore. She spent the first day all over my MIL, FIL, and SIL. She liked cuddling on the new beds, and slept like a rock to catchup on sleep. She liked running and racing in the yard and she liked exploring the new town.

But, we're not alone in the house. There's 2 houses here, everyone's in the other except 1 family member below us. They have their own dog (they don't care about each other), but everytime she sees our dog she gives her treats, or chicken, or other food. She plies her with food in that expected grandma ""oh no she's starving"" way. And since then, our dog has changed.

She sits at the top of the stairs and cries, whines, SCREAMS, to be let down at the slightest noise. If there's even a single chance that the noise below was grandma, she MUST go down. I mean she's whined more in the last 48 hours than her *entire* first year. If we let her freely roam, she spends all her time trying to scratch into her bedroom, or steal the other dogs food. She's not hungry. She's eating all her meals as normal, she's even gained weight. She's just gone ballistic for grandma snacks. 

We've had to impose rules. 1 treat a day. That turned into a back and forth negotiation, ""oh I didn't think you meant x"". Now it's nothing. Nobody can give her food except us. But it feels too late.

Today she's whined, I am not kidding, for nearly 4 hours. The treat giver isn't even home! She just heard stuff downstairs. No matter if we let her investigate or not, she's not satisfied. 

Before, she'd like to explore and sniff around the yard. But now whenever we get back from walks, she sprints at top speed to the front door. SCREAMS to be let in. And if nobody is there? Doesn't matter, she'll SCREAM again. 

And it's not something else. We know it's for the food. She runs to the exact same spot, sniffs around. Nothing? She'll run around and check each room. She only calms down (momentarily) if she gets what she's after. 

I don't know what to do. I feel so melodramatic. But I've barely done anything to relax in approaching 3 days. I've walked her to distract her. I've given her treats up here. We've imposed a no food rule from others. From about 10am - 5pm (when grandma goes to bed), literally nothing will calm her from whining at top volume. She wasn't like this tje first 3 days, it was a very clear ""oh shit I get extra chicken"" shift. 

I'm sure when we leave, and are at our new home, she'll get the hint nobody is around and chill out. I'm sure she'll return to normal. 

But how the heck do I deal with *here*?

1fzpz3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1fzpz3h/always_getting_sour_shots_with_gcp_evo_i_need/,Always getting sour shots with GCP Evo. I need some help.,"I got a GCP Evo about a month ago. I still have a few days left before I can return it but I feel like it has to be a me problem and not a problem with the machine. No matter what I do my shot is always sour. Every single shot has tasted the exact same and I've probably pulled close to 40-50 shots. It's undrinkable. I do have the barista gadgets PID installed. 

Here's my setup:
- varia vs3 gen 2 grinder 
- normcore 18g basket 
- wdt tool
- normcore 58.5mm self leveling tamper 
- I've tried counter culture big trouble, stumptown founders, merit wildcatter espresso blend, and oak Cliff coffee roasters espresso blend (all have been roasted about 2-3 weeks earlier)

Here's the process: I grind 18g. For the grind settings I've done anywhere between 1.5 and 3 on the varia vs3 gen 2. Anything less than 1.5 chokes the machine and usually above 2.6ish the espresso flows out very fast. So I don't think it's a grinder problem. Almost every post or article says to grind finer but no matter how fine I grind it still tastes sour. I try to go for a yield ratio of anywhere from 1:2 to 1:3. Every ratio tastes sour to the point I even tried going 1:4 and that tastes the exact same. The time to yield have been in the range of the suggested times of 25-30 seconds. Still sour I've pulled shots longer at 40-50 seconds and it it's still sour. 

From what I've read it seems sour is underextraction. I don't have a refined palate but it doesn't taste bitter. It's undrinkable. I thought at one point maybe installed the PID wrong. Maybe the water was too cold. But it appears to be working fine. I have cranked up the temp to the max 115C which flash boils the water coming from the group head and it's still sour! I typically keep the temp set at 103C with an offset of -8C. 

I feel like my puck prep is good. I wdt to break up and clumps and then tamp. Do you think it's the beans? I've heard darker roasts are easiest. I assumed espresso blend beans would be dark roast but after some reading it appears that is not the case. I think I'm going to hutna bag of specifically labeled dark roast.

On the next day my tinnitus was very quiet, the quietest it had been in over a month. It returned to baseline on the next day.

From my experience alcohol has no effect on my tinnitus; caffeine I'm not 100% sure but I don't think so; for the past months I have limited my exposure to loud sounds with no success (still using earphones at low volume); I tried changing my body position during sleep also without success.

The only clear correlation so far is sleep. Being sleep deprived makes it worse but on the other side sleeping isn't a guarantee that it will get better. Usually, naps or short sleep sessions don't have an effect or can even make my T worse. I need a long uninterrupted night of sleep.

As for why it got better on the next day, my speculation is that, due to how tired and drunk I got, I was able to reach a deeper state of relaxation during the 4 to 5 hours of sleep that I had that night.

I don't have hyperacusis or TMJ AFAIK.  I do have SNHL.

My financial situation is good; I handle all the rent, shopping, and bills (even though he is a student, he receives government support).

In short, the first few months felt magical, but that happiness didn’t last long. After about 1 to 1.5 months, I felt a distance between us. I tried to talk to him many times to resolve whatever the issue might be, but he absolutely does not want to talk and insists that there’s no problem.

The week we were to marry, I asked him multiple times to think about it a bit more, and he told me he loves me very much but always struggles to express his feelings.

I work from home, and we live in a two-bedroom apartment. There’s nothing unclean in our home.. He has never come home from class or left for class without food. I make different meals three times a day and make his coffee, ensuring he has a quiet environment to study. I always try to maintain a good relationship with his family and never bring up anything about his past.

In other words, I’ve done everything possible to keep this relationship alive. I’ve never raised my voice. Sometimes I caught him lying, and when I confronted him, he denied it but later apologized and repeated the same behavior. I don’t know why he’s trying not to lose me, but I’m sure it’s not out of love. I’ve told him multiple times that he doesn’t have to love me and shouldn’t feel guilty.

As for our sexual relationship, everything was great in the first months, but something changed after the second month; now it happens once a month, if at all. He turns away and goes to sleep.

Yesterday's continued mild bearishness realized after some unexpected notable events in the options market. However, at the same time, trending signals for a short-term price reversal have continued to develop. What will it mean for our price action today and into our 10/11 weekly expiry? Let's find out!

**Price Movement Recap**

After traders took advantage of the slippery, MM hedging sympathy around $21 in order to generate some recovery energy early in our AM session. The price mounted the 200-min SMA and VWAP for some upward dynamism before reversing back to those two levels and flattening out on low volume.

[10\/8 Trading Day 1-min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/bcr4739dkptd1.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4429d65d315e4625bed31f33dcfbdf2f4fe07e)

What dragged our price down mid-day and carried us to a new low appears to have been a very large volume of  $20 and $25 17 Jan 2025 Calls (several million $ in premium) just before 1pm EDT and then again at about 1:45pm EDT:

Some examples:

https://preview.redd.it/q43meoazmptd1.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a9aae19187ff62e84f539d744c79bb2976c7164

This appears to have been the Bullish whale from 9/27 (perhaps an institution) closing these trades at a 20-25%-ish loss. If we hop over to our OI changes for Jan 17 we can see this was indeed our guy from 9/27 cutting losses on the entire trade and not an overzealous short-seller:

If this was a leveraged trader, then he may have had this position liquidated as a result of combined contract devaluation from underlying and IV loss despite the fact that when he was forced to exit the trade the price was not in a critical downtrend. When MMs finished offloading their share hedges on this position (several hundred thousand) the price recovered back to the 200SMA where it closed the trading day.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

[10\/11 OI Changes 10\/8-10\/9](https://preview.redd.it/itl92a1csptd1.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=419381882bde644c201159c5cde5c27c9aa5a994)

With Max Pain still sitting at $21 and our overall options volume light, new OI changes have been minimal (outside of the Jan 17 large retractions). New calls were concentrated around $21 while some new Puts have come on the board at $19.50. 10/18 New OI was pretty minimal:

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/k2g8lb1lqptd1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=1992af9d73283a8732203c859d656ad26fe119c3

As we see above, yesterday's options activity has largely continued the reshaping trend we started to see in yesterday's premarket report, namely that $21 is shifting positive and more stable while total gamma levels at $20 and $20.50 remain thick and volatility suppressant. Significant trading volume could stimulate a dynamic reversal back up to around $22 - Friday will once again be the optimal candidate for this type of move if the price can stay pinned beneath $21 and around $20.50. If total daily volume remains around 5mil, we will likely trade in a tight range around our current price levels i.e. $21-$20.50.

**Technicals**

As we take a look at our technical patterns, we can see several indicators are converging on signals indicative of a short-term, mild price recovery in advance of the prospective post-OPEX breakout that is projected by the converge of our two daily SMAs. RSI levels and IV are approaching the levels they showed during each of our last upside reversals since July. This minor reversal up to about $22 looks primed to occur essentially during today's trading, but as we've seen, institutions may look to keep the price controlled and constrained at its current value in order to optimize their own returns on such a short-term reversal. 

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean IV](https://preview.redd.it/yp1hbdsouptd1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f06773f7d06744d6c4b83bf46820d77b95cb8c1)

IV has slumped again dipping to a daily level of around 84% - just a few percentage points above the lows we saw in late August (77.9%), before the first earnings run up (84.6%), after the earnings drop (81%). Call Writers have already made a killing this week and last by selling into our pop last Monday with extrinsic devaluation even into November already about 60% fulfilled off last Monday's high. If they have enough time to set themselves up Long and vacuum up delta on the cheap, they see this as prime opportunity to rinse and repeat their tactics into October OPEX without upsetting the general options structure and framework on the MM side of things on the whole.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

IV and Price levels are approaching those points which are suggestive of a short-term upside reversal in the stock price - up to $22. The signals began to present themselves yesterday and continued their trend. Volume died out, but was unusually bearish largely as the result of the Bullish Whale from 9/27 being forced to cut losses on his January call positions either by margin call or stop loss. Major downside volatility looks limited and extremely unlikely, though institutions could trap the price in these lower levels or try to force it down into the huge total gamma position at $20 in order to maximize potential returns on an upside reversal. Major upside reversal, however, still looks not to be expected until after 10/18 OPEX.

Good luck out there!

Cheers

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

Dark: dark chocolate and cinnamon. Makes me feel like a Mexican hot chocolate come to life!

Bake: inspired by lemon cupcakes, this makes me feel like the freshly toasted meringue atop a lemon meringue pie. Toasty lemon vanilla goodness. 

Rise: perfect summer scent, piña colada and tiare flower take you away to your favorite tropical locale. 

Smoke: on first spray, pure pipe tobacco. On dry down, it gives the exact scent of a wood burning stove. Perfect for cold weather. 

Haze: Inspired by cannabis, this is the most masculine green smell ever. The clary sage and eucalyptus are fresh and edgy at the same time. 

Malt: this one must be sprayed on skin. On paper, it smells like a game of Edward 40 Hands 🤢 On skin, it’s smokey whiskey, leather, and patchouli. 

Night: Rose, saffron, agarwood, and musk come together to make a sweet and enchanting scent. Be warned, there is a cumin note that can be quite divisive, but I don’t pick up on it. 

Ink: lovely, but I don’t pick up on the ink or tar notes, just the vetiver and jasmine.  My quest for the perfect ink note continues. 

Bonus Samples:

Infuse: a slightly smokey, bright tea scent with bergamot and vetiver. Lovely!

Smile: a simple formula of raspberry, sage, and musk. Not very long wearing or high sillage, but positively delightful. 

This is my first discovery set review, so be kind! Ask if you have any questions!

I'll take all the advice, please! ","We are hosting my daughter's wedding at our house the first week of November and I would appreciate any advice. The basics: 11am brunch. I worked for a caterer throughout college and feel pretty confident about the food. Cake is ordered, flowers will be simple DIY, mostly greenery. 

Food--nothing hot or frozen (lesson from catering); charcuterie, cheese/fruit/nuts board, bread basket, hummus for vegans. Got compostable bamboo table ware. Glassware is handled mason jars with bamboo lids and metal straws that will work for the iced-coffee bar, iced tea, juice, and mimosas--thinking of serving the mimosas only at the end for both cost and to avoid some family members getting messy.\* Glassware is intended as party favors so guests can take them to-go. 

People--this was originally supposed to be just immediate family \~10 people, and of course it has spooled out to \~30. Our house is pretty big and our officiant is bringing folding chairs, but I'm a bit intimidated by this piece. Stocking up on toilet paper, maybe disposable hand towels? Begging family members to carpool or Uber as parking can be tricky in the neighborhood. 

Help--officiant and photographer are lined up, but wondering if I should spring for a hired hand or two? 

\*Messy family members--We've got some. The original plan was not to invite them but daughter went rogue when I was traveling and told me after the fact. Hoping that the early day and short duration (11-1) helps, as well as the limited alcohol. I've asked a few people to try to interrupt any talk of politics.

I’ve recently (within the last 6 months) become the manager at the coffee shop i’ve been working at for the last three years. I’m managing around 30 staff members ages 16-30. I’m 21. 

I work full time, study at university full time, and live out of home. I love my job for the most part, but lately I’ve been feeling overwhelmed and exhausted, and like i’m consistently coming to work in a bad mood, which I hate. I don’t know what to do to fix it. I’ve had little to no management training from anyone above me, and am essentially my workers HR department as well. I’m constantly hearing about how much they hate working and how awful it is, which I understand, it can definitely suck sometimes, but I feel like it’s taking a bit of a toll on me. I’m exhausted, all the time, so much so that i’m struggling to complete my own university work on top of my workload, and am so emotionally drained at the end of the day that I just want to sleep lol. 

The other side of it is that I’m now ‘in charge’ of people that were my friends, it feels like now that I’m telling them what to do, the friendships I had aren’t really the same. Which is to be expected, I suppose, but it’s just weird. Work was my biggest social outlet before I became the manager, and now that I am, I feel like people don’t want much to do with me, even though I try my hardest to be kind and compassionate to my employees. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to complain. I worked hard to get where I am at my age and I do enjoy a lot of my work aspects. Does anyone have advice or literally anything at all? ",1,1728474951.0,managers,0,1.0,False
1fzplz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/butchlesbians/comments/1fzplz4/grateful_for_my_privilege_not_getting_creeped_on/,Grateful for my privilege: not getting creeped on by weird dudes,"I was sipping a coffee at my favorite cafe a few minutes ago when I heard the owner raising his voice to a customer. Some guy was asking to speak to an employee (a petite woman).

The owner said: “she doesn’t speak good English, what do you want?”

And the guy kept reiterating that he wanted “to talk to her” and pointed at the employee, and the owner stood in front of her loudly asking if he wanted to order anything.

The cafe was frozen, staring at the guy.

It’s a packed place filled with regulars. We all know damn well that the woman in question speaks perfectly good English.

One of the owner’s friends escorted the guy out of the store, and a couple of the men walked outside and stood near the door with their arms folded, like guardians of the cafe.

After the incident the owner shook his head and told the next person in line that he’s tired of men treating his female employees like this. One of them actually quit a few months ago due to anxiety from creepers.

It’s a pretty nice area with low crime and a lot of foot traffic outside of the major tourist spots.

I adore the people at this cafe, they’re practically an adoptive family to me. I had heard about the women being harassed by weirdos, but it was my first time really seeing it up close. It made my blood boil.

There were plenty of men around to deal with the creeper, but it brought out my “mother hen” energy. I memorized his face so I could keep an eye out for him in the future, if he ever comes back some morning when one of the ladies is working alone.

Once, after the shop was closed and the staff was cleaning up, I saw a drunk dude in a onesie banging in the door demanding a beer and to speak with one of the women who worked there. I threatened to call the cops on him and told him to leave, and he he did.

I remember going out with my (presumably straight, feminine) lady friends during a college study abroad program. They were all gussied up and buzzed, out to have fun on the town… and there I was right behind them (also buzzed, lol) reminding them to move their purses away from the street, and making prolonged eye contact with any dudes who looked at them wrong. On a few occasions guys got handsy and I stepped between them and my friends, and told them off.

I am average height, a thicker, muscular build, with short spiky hair. The rest of the world assumed I was a butch lesbian decades before I realized it myself.

Men have almost never fucked with me. A few idiots did in middle and high school. On these occasions if teacher saw me fight back, they smiled and turned their back, pretending not to notice as I gave bullies a taste of their own medicine. I was a nerdy goth girl with big boots who took all the honors and college credit classes. I am grateful that my positive reputation with teachers (and being a girl) meant that I could fight back against boys and not be punished for it.

It didn’t happen often, just enough that they stopped trying it.

Seeing incidents like the one this morning makes me realize how much I take it for granted that I am not the target of this sort of attention. Men with ill intentions tend to target smaller, thinner women. The “pretty” ones.

Yeah, I’ve been abused by men who are close to me, but in this case I am talking about the randos on the street. Sure, I am stronger than average and am less of a target, but if a typical man wanted to hurt me, he could. And there’s a 50/50 chance I would lock up out of fear and self-preservation.

I feel like my gender identity and presentation have a lot to do with why this isn’t a major part of my life. I am grateful for this, but it makes me furious on behalf of the women who do get this treatment. I was glad to see the men protect the employee this morning. Afterward the owner gave her a hug and asked if she was okay, if she needed to take a break for a bit. That’s a good use of the physical strength nature blessed them with.

Anyway… that’s my ramble/rant. On one hand I am grateful for the benefits my masc presentation gives me, even if it’s just projecting “don’t fuck with me” vibes to the sort of idiot who looks for ways to exploit others. On the other hand, I feel a little weird about my feeling of protectiveness. Like… I am pretty sure it comes from a place of love and not condescension.

I am glad to be able to use it when needed, and I have used it to defend male friends as well… but… it also makes me uncomfortable. Maybe because I think this energy is too closely related to the energy used by creepers? Light and dark side of the force, yadda yadda?

We had a good relationship in a lot of ways but we did distance relationship which took a toll on me. She had experienced that sort of relationship before so it was more natural for her. We spent the weekends together. I say we had a good relationship but we both had our problems . Her problem by far the most serious which she got ptsd treatment for , my dad was diagnosed with cancer so you can imagine the severity , I tried to be there for her as much as I could and help her through it. But it took a toll on our relationship, we didn’t have sex and she would take strong sleeping pills and go right too sleep not wanting to cuddle. 
This sounds like she didn’t love me but she really did , she was just going trough a lot and felt safe with me. Anyways my mind started to feel like she did in fact not love me. She had plans of moving to study in Australia and work in a different part of Sweden for the summer. I did not see a logistical future. 
I felt really down about this one day and opened the door for a breakup, then things just rolled on. I felt I wanted to talk about things but she couldn’t handle it and became very emotional (don’t blame her ) and it resulted in a break. She wanted no contact and removed me everywhere. Dialed me drunk one time . 
Then we met for a coffee and exchanged clothes and such , we talked but I felt contempt with our decision. We hugged and whished each other the best. 
The first 2 months were fine but since then I miss her terribly, not least because I know she now lives in my town , the thing I wanted the most for us. I want to reach out but I’m sure she has moved on, I want to tell her all the things I should have said. 
I know I’m avoidant wich I need to work on , I feel I made a mistake.

I feel like most places I go, there's plenty of people who will use you and take credit for your work which always seems to happen to me, I'm often overlooked or undervalued in most places I work at due to this.

I've worked for quite a few company's now, and the one I am at now seems to have the best culture by far but I just can't seem to enjoy working with many devs, due to no one respecting my intelligence and ability to do my job (it's very isolating being a woman in tech)

I'm at the point now where I'm debating if this is the career for me anymore as it's also the type of job where you think about fixing things or going the extra mile after working hours just to prove yourself... 

The only big issue is the pay I get paid 40k (uk) to do my job, I work from home and have flexibility, there's also room for pay rises of course when I progress.

He was the first bf to ever live with us. I divorced their dad in 2016 and he is not a positive presence in their life. They, esp my youngest, really bonded with him. It made my heart so happy. 

Everything between us was great (or so it seemed). We both always had a lot going on in our own lives with work and family etc. but always always involved eachother and made time for eachother. It was the best relationship i ever had. I cook him and my kids homemade meals 5x a week for dinner, usually packing leftovers for my bf for his lunches as he works long hours in a blue collar job. I did so much for him and he was always sweet and thoughtful and never ever got a temper. 

I should note I wasn’t really charging him rent. He moved in sort of out of circumstances and I was happy to help him out. I continued to pay my own rent & utilities as I had been on my own forever now. I also supplied snacks, bought him shower stuff, washed his clothes during the day (I wfh) and just spoiled him with gifts (just random ones like sunglasses or vans or whatever) bc he was so nice and helpful- and I loved him. He always made sure we had fresh flowers in the house and he offered to do whatever to help me out. It wasn’t until maybe 4 months in- I started asking he chip in some money. (He works, works OT too, and doesn’t have nearly half the expenses I do- no car payment, he has company gas card etc). My kids dad had gone 3+ months without paying child support so it wasn’t so easy supporting us all on my own anymore. He did not argue this and had sent me a total of $547 in various chunks over the past month or so. He also paid for a few meals for me and the kids like from xabys, chikfila etc.

This past weekend, my bf woke me up by cuddling me (totally not out of the norm). He initiated sex and we did that- he asked if I wanted coffee- and he made that and brought it up to me. I then made him and my son and his friend a big breakfast. My plans that day were to take my son to an amusement park with friends. My daughter was with her grandfather. My bf and I cuddled on the couch, talked normal etc. I got ready, kissed him goodbye and left. We texted normal throughout the day but something felt off- he was supposed to be resting and getting an xray on his ankle he hurt skateboarding but his location showed him driving all over the place- to his storage unit- and to another town. 

By 6pm my daughter wanted to go home so I texted him and asked when he’d be back at the house. It was then when we texted me that he moved his things out and he’s sorry and knows I’m going to hate him but he had to go for now and focus on himself. He said we could talk in person after “things cool off” and then I was immediately blocked. Blocked on ig too. And not just me- my son, and all my best friends- even my mother. 

It turns out he moved 25 min away. Into a place with a guy from work. I was totally blindsided. But the worst part is I have no idea how long he’s had this planned. How long he’s been faking his affection to me and my kids. On top of that, earlier that week he had requested some “sexy pics” of me- which was not his style- he never did that our whole relationship and never took any. He also made some sexual requests- which was somewhat out of character for him too. But I happily obliged. He requested butt sex 2x in the 7-10 days leading up to his “escape” and looking back- really made it count. He KNEW it was going to be the last time. The fact he also got one more bang in that morning- knowing he was packing and leaving once I left my house- and acted totally normal and sweet has really mindfucked me. 

He has sent me one message since this day that says he’s really sorry he just can’t live with me and he was overwhelmed not having personal space and living with kids and that he needs to make time for himself and doesn’t want it seem he’s using me/ and that he can’t settle for someone else’s life when he still wants to create his own. And that he is bad at communicating and please don’t be mad we can talk in person in a bit. 

My kids and I have been a wreck. My daughter has cried everyday. She keeps asking me if he called or when he’s coming back or if she’ll ever see him again or if it was her fault. I haven’t eaten since Sunday bc I’m sick from replaying the past month in my mind looking for any indication of this and still don’t see it. I feel totally violated- sexually, emotionally and financially. I miss the crap out of him at the same time. To make matters worse he is telling friends that he didn’t like not being able to parent my son and that I wouldn’t allow him to and that he had tried to leave before but I “wouldn’t let him” so he had to take this opportunity when we’d be gone all day to go-which is not true whatsoever!!! He never ever tried to leave or even had SAID anything about it. I think it’s bc his free ride was coming to an end?? I just don’t know. He didn’t have me blocked on fb but he won’t open my messages. He won’t talk to me. Idk what was real and what wasn’t and how long he’s been planning this bc he never said a word. 

Idk how to PROCESS this feeling of disgust and being violated in so many personal and intimate ways.",6,1728473716.0,LifeAdvice,5,1.0,False

OKay!  Not your typical Outback subject but most Subaru drivers like to drink coffee and the people over at r/coffee are snobs and anal, even.    I just started making coffee at home that isn't instant or pod based.   This is about 2-3 table spoon but this time around, I eyeballed it.  I'm not sure how strong people make their coffee but I have a preference for dark roast or something bold.  This was the store bought Starbucks ground called ""House"".   I also like their ""Breakfast"" blend.    My travel mug is about 600ml no idea how many ounces that is, but it's a travel mug and sometimes it's hit or miss.   I'm told you steep the ground after stirring in hot water for 5 minutes to extract maximum flavour.  I use an Ikea French Press and the consistency is also very inconsistent.

The only time I caught a glimpse of the live was by me scrolling on my for you page.  

My observation:   We as functioning adults in the world have the luxury of being surrounded by friends family coworkers or even a random person we meet on the train, bus or coffee shop.  We all learn from each other.  We talk we share and at times we pick up on wisdom from other people’s life experiences.  At least I know I have.   Every day I learn something new from someone.  

These 2 ding bats have chosen to live a secluded life.  The only communication they have with the outside world is the cashier at whatever store or gas station they go to.  They never engage in conversation with anyone. The only other connection is on their lives where viewers sometimes share good advice with them and each other.  It’s awesome!

Now - having said all that - I noticed last night that the man child did not show his back crack like he normally does.  I thought to myself maybe he caught our posts here (we all know they both read this page) and just maybe he realized that he is destroying his wholesome image that we all enjoyed when we first started watching their lives - at least it was for me.   I was taken in by a young family who seemed kind and wholesome.  (Not like the Walton’s! - more like a good family) 
I see that the many posts about his behavior on lives were removed from this page as the mods thought it inappropriate.  However maybe that was not the best move.  If S can learn how his actions are perceived by some (there are many silent watchers who may agree with us but are not on this page and nor do they comment on lives for fear of being blocked) then he’s going to be a better man for it.  He may come to realize hey my mom did not raise me this way.  I was raised a city boy. 

I for one would like to commend S for showing us the old S.  The one who was more interested in a better behavior in front of others.  

If you do not feel this post is acceptable to your audience I’m sure you will have no problem removing it.  However before doing so understand that I’m posting this with intention of educating and not criticizing.  

This page should not only be for snarking.  It can also be used to help A and S see how we see them from a screen.

Last year, I booked a cabin break with some friends and got hammered every single day of the trip. I had fun, sure, but I also woke up on two of the mornings soaked in my own urine after blacking out the night before. I woke up every morning with palpitations and anxiety which I just had to push through to continue having a good time. I spent over £100 just on booze and the recycling bin was heaving by the end of it. 

This year, I booked a cabin break again just with my dogs and new(ish) partner who doesn’t drink either. I was a little bit worried that I’d be bored not being able to drink and I was worried for nothing! We did some great hikes / walks, we lazed in the hot tub, we drank coffee and ate copious amounts of cake, we drank a couple of N/A beers and for the most part, just utterly relaxed and enjoyed ourselves. 

This is my first sober birthday since I was a teenager. It’s been absolute bliss, 0 anxiety, no hangovers, no feeling sick, no embarrassing myself, no headaches. That’s another life event completed - sober!

Combining the velvety smoothness of classic cheesecake with the indulgent flavor of Nutella, this dessert is a chocolate lover’s dream. With its luscious texture and hazelnut-chocolate goodness, Nutella cheesecake is the perfect treat for special occasions, gatherings, or whenever you want to impress your guests with a decadent dessert.

In this article, we’ll walk you through the steps to make this delicious Nutella cheesecake, along with some tips and tricks to make it just right.

**Why You’ll Love Nutella Cheesecake**

Nutella Cheesecake is a luxurious dessert that’s both easy to make and incredibly satisfying. The creamy cheesecake filling has the perfect balance of sweetness and tang, and when combined with the rich, nutty taste of Nutella, it creates a melt-in-your-mouth experience. The best part? This cheesecake doesn’t require a water bath, making it much simpler to prepare than other traditional cheesecakes. Plus, its beautiful presentation makes it an impressive centerpiece for any dessert table.

**Ingredients for Nutella Cheesecake**

To create this indulgent Nutella cheesecake, you’ll need the following ingredients:

**For the Crust:**

* **2 cups graham cracker crumbs**ﾠ(or crushed chocolate cookies)
* **1/4 cup granulated sugar**
* **1/2 cup butter**ﾠ(melted)

**For the Cheesecake Filling:**

* **3 (8 oz) packages cream cheese** (softened)
* **1 cup Nutella**
* **1 cup powdered sugar**
* **1 teaspoon vanilla extract**
* **1/2 cup heavy whipping cream**

**For the Topping:**

* **1/4 cup Nutella** (warmed, for drizzling)
* **Chopped hazelnuts** (optional, for garnish)
* **Whipped cream** (optional, for serving)

**Step-by-Step Recipe for Nutella Cheesecake**

**Step 1: Prepare the Crust**

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs (or crushed cookies) with the granulated sugar and melted butter. Mix well until the crumbs are evenly coated.
3. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan to form the crust.
4. Bake the crust for about 8–10 minutes, then let it cool completely while you prepare the filling.

**Step 2: Make the Cheesecake Filling**

1. In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until it’s smooth and creamy.
2. Add the Nutella, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract to the bowl. Continue to mix until all the ingredients are well combined and the filling is smooth.
3. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until it forms stiff peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into the Nutella mixture until fully incorporated.

**Step 3: Assemble the Cheesecake**

1. Pour the Nutella cheesecake filling over the cooled crust, spreading it evenly with a spatula.
2. Smooth the top of the cheesecake and refrigerate for at least 4–6 hours, or overnight, to allow it to set.

**Step 4: Add the Toppings**

1. Once the cheesecake is fully set, warm the Nutella slightly so it’s easier to drizzle.
2. Drizzle the Nutella over the top of the cheesecake in a decorative pattern.
3. Sprinkle chopped hazelnuts on top for an extra crunch, if desired.
4. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream on each slice, if you like.

**Tips for Making the Best Nutella Cheesecake**

1. **Room temperature ingredients:** Make sure your cream cheese is softened to room temperature before mixing. This helps prevent lumps in the cheesecake filling.
2. **Chill time is essential:** Letting the cheesecake chill for at least 6 hours (or overnight) ensures that it sets properly and holds its shape when sliced.
3. **Crust options:** You can use graham crackers, chocolate cookies, or even hazelnut cookies for the crust to enhance the nutty flavor of the cheesecake.
4. **No-bake option:** For a no-bake version, simply skip baking the crust and place it directly in the refrigerator to set. This is great for when you’re short on time or don’t want to use the oven.
5. **Decorate to impress:**ﾠFor a stunning presentation, pipe extra whipped cream around the edges of the cheesecake and sprinkle with chocolate shavings or hazelnut pieces.

**Why This Recipe Works**

The combination of rich, creamy Nutella and smooth cream cheese creates a filling that’s indulgent yet balanced in sweetness. Folding in the whipped cream lightens the texture, giving the cheesecake a velvety mouthfeel. The crisp crust provides a perfect contrast to the soft filling, while the Nutella drizzle on top ties everything together with an extra touch of chocolatey goodness. This cheesecake is easy to make yet delivers a dessert that tastes like it came from a high-end bakery.

**Serving Suggestions for Nutella Cheesecake**

* **For special occasions:**ﾠNutella cheesecake is a showstopper for birthdays, anniversaries, or holiday gatherings. Its rich flavors and elegant look make it perfect for celebrations.
* **With coffee or dessert wine:**ﾠPair a slice with a hot cup of espresso or a glass of sweet dessert wine to balance the richness of the cheesecake.
* **As a make-ahead dessert:** Since this cheesecake needs time to chill, it’s a great option for preparing in advance for parties or dinners.

**Conclusion**

**Nutella Cheesecake** is the ultimate dessert for anyone who loves the combination of chocolate and hazelnut. With its smooth, creamy texture and rich Nutella flavor, this cheesecake is both easy to make and sure to impress. Whether you’re serving it at a holiday party or enjoying it as a treat for yourself, this Nutella cheesecake will quickly become a favorite.

TW: death and paranormal.

I live in the PNW and camp solo a lot with my dogs. I rarely get the boogins but the night before I left I had an uncomfortable feeling about this trip. Keep in mind, I had just been to this exact spot (Baker National Forest) every weekend for the last month. This wasn’t anything different or unknown.

I drive out, which takes about 1.5 hours from home, get to one of my favorite spots (one I had just camped at 2 weeks ago). I get out of my SUV to walk around to make sure it was empty. I got an overwhelming feeling I was not safe, and left. There was not anything weird, just a gut feeling. I drive down the gravel road to another favorite spot (I had just camped at this one the weekend before) and it feels better. I start to unpack but felt like I should sleep in my car. I never sleep in my car. Anyways, I set up, chill out, play with my dogs and it quickly gets dark (it’s Oct, it gets dark at 7). Being the granny I am, I love an early bed time. So I grabbed a beer, my dogs, and snuggled into my car to listen to podcasts (yes, murder podcasts). I fall asleep, I’m all warm and snuggly with my German Shepard and my Pit Bull and at 2:51 am, yes to be exact, my pit bull who was asleep and under the covers, jumps up and starts growling and barking at something outside my car. I think it's an animal and am not alarmed. My German Shepherd was doing absolutely nothing, which was also weird. My Pit keeps barking and it’s getting more intense and I say out loud to her, with my head under the covers “ok Stevie, you’re really freaking me out”, pop my head up to see what she was freaking out about and I see a white light, like a head lamp, bobbing and floating down the road towards my car, like it was on someone’s head, but there was NO PERSON. I’m frozen, watching this orb dance down the road and then dissipate. I just saw a fucking ghost! My mind is racing. omg did someone die? Did my dad die? (My Dad is on hospice, given my time off and needing to run to the woods so much). Oh my god, did my dad decline overnight and that was his spirit!? 

I’m in the middle of nowhere,  no service. It’s a 45 min drive to make a call… I fell back asleep like the sleep Queen I am. I wake up in the morning, thinking that was so crazy! I can’t wait to tell my friends. I walk down to my cooler and crate and both are open. Not messy, just slightly opened. I thought mayyybbee those Rainiers made me forget to close them? Highly unlikely, I’m a very responsible drunk. Anyways, everything is gone from my cooler (some random camping food, including a *glass* jar of coffee creamer). No scraps or mess anywhere, just gone. I go to my crate and my dry goods bag was gone too. Again, no mess. I walked all around the area, no mess, nothing. Im weirded out to say the least. I drive down to get service to call my best friend and to get some more supplies from the tiny store. I tell her my story and we can’t figure out if it was a person or animals.

**Person:** why didn’t they steal any equipment? How gutsy! Also at 3:00 am? Also! Why wear a headlamp to go steal someone’s food!?? My dog was also alerting me. Where was your body sir! Did a ghost steal my food? 

**Animal:** what kind of evolved animal politely opens my cooler, takes all my items out, including a glass jar, and packs their little grocery tote and walks away to their home? No mess. I am an experienced camper, yes, I should have done better and put my stuff in my car, but again, beer and sleep was on my mind.  

We can’t figure it out. She thinks mountain man, who was just hungry. BOOGINS GALORE! Nope. I hang up with her and call one of my best guy friends, 'E', to see if I can camp on their property, I was officially spooked. He answers but my best friend is immediately calling me back. I ask him to hold and answer, she says “M just sent me a text, E’s dad died last night” CHILLS.

1. How rude: I just put my bud on hold whose Dad just died.
2. What the fuck

I switch back over and immediately say how sorry I am and then I tell him my story (after much respect and talk about his Dad, I’m not a dick). Hes not a paranormal believer like I am, but he too can’t explain any this.

So again, I ask you all: exceptionally tidy ANIMALS + GHOST or Mountain Man!? 

Btw I moved sites again and stayed another 2 nights, cause I’m a white girl who is asking to be on the news apparently. I drove home at 2am this morning and here I am, posting.

No, I do not have a gun, but yes, I am getting a gun.

1fzoxoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Learnlabyrinth/comments/1fzoxoz/tips_for_lazy_students_to_get_things_done/,Tips for Lazy Students to Get Things Done! 😴📚,"We all have those days when motivation is low, and the couch looks way more inviting than our textbooks. If you’re a self-proclaimed “lazy student” (like me!), here are some tips to help you get started and actually get things done without feeling overwhelmed:

1. **Start Small**: Instead of looking at your entire to-do list, pick one small task to complete. Whether it’s reading a page, writing a paragraph, or studying for just 10 minutes, starting small makes the workload feel less daunting.
2. **Create a Routine**: Establish a daily or weekly study routine, even if it’s just an hour a day. Consistency can help make studying a habit, and once it’s part of your routine, it won’t feel like such a chore.
3. **Set Mini Goals**: Break your larger tasks into smaller, more manageable goals. Instead of saying “I need to study for my exam,” try “I’ll review Chapter 1 for 15 minutes.” This makes it easier to start and gives you a sense of accomplishment.
4. **Use Timers**: Try the Pomodoro Technique—set a timer for 25 minutes, work during that time, then take a 5-minute break. Repeat this cycle, and you’ll find that you can accomplish more than you think in short bursts.
5. **Find Your Motivation**: Identify what motivates you—whether it’s a reward after completing a task or a study buddy to hold you accountable. Understanding your own motivation can help push you to get started.
6. **Limit Distractions**: Put your phone away or use apps that block distracting websites during your study sessions. Creating a distraction-free environment can make it easier to focus and get your work done.
7. **Change Your Study Environment**: Sometimes, a change of scenery can boost your motivation. Try studying in a coffee shop, library, or a different room in your house. A new environment can make studying feel fresher and less boring.
8. **Use Study Aids**: Look for tools and resources that can make studying easier and more engaging. Apps like Quizlet, Khan Academy, or YouTube educational channels can help break down material in a way that’s easier to digest.
9. **Study with Friends**: Find a group of friends or classmates to study with. It can make studying more enjoyable and keep you accountable. Plus, you can help each other out with concepts you find challenging!
10. **Set a Deadline**: Give yourself a specific deadline for completing tasks, even if it’s self-imposed. Knowing you have a time limit can push you to get started and make studying feel more urgent.
11. **Incorporate Fun into Studying**: Make studying more enjoyable by incorporating games or fun activities. Use flashcards, create quizzes, or turn material into a game with friends. Learning doesn’t have to be boring!
12. **Reward Yourself**: Set up a reward system for completing tasks. Treat yourself to something you enjoy, like a favorite snack, a show, or some time on social media after finishing a study session.
13. **Use Visual Aids**: Create colorful mind maps, charts, or infographics to visualize information. Engaging with the material in a more interactive way can help keep your interest alive and improve retention.
14. **Don’t Overthink It**: Sometimes, the pressure to do everything perfectly can stop you from starting. Just begin—even if it’s not perfect. The important part is getting something done, and you can refine it later.
15. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Everyone has lazy days, and that’s okay! Don’t beat yourself up for not being productive all the time. Recognize when you need a break and allow yourself to rest without guilt.",1,1728472498.0,Learnlabyrinth,0,1.0,False

**Story so Far:**

*  The team attends a briefing at the Teth-Odin's Jormungandr Guild. 
* Ingrid learns Zefir is seen as a ""Pounding Boy""; a bottom for being surrounded by girls. 
* People make jokes about Ingrid being a bed warmer for a snooty backed-up elf (Siria) 
* Ingrid adopts a Fae Hare and names him Cuddly. 
* Cuddly needs snacks! 
* The team is briefed on what monsters to not attack as well as the current sub-optimal conditions of the dungeon right now. 
* Neith, Selphie and Cuddly are registered as adventurers.

\_\_\_

**Autumnhollow, Two Days Later:**

The Control Center, as it was now called, was the former study or guest bedroom located at the ground floor of the Autumnhollow house. It was the room where the computers and other devices were set up so Zefir and Gwen could perform their task as Mission Control.

Like the master bedroom, the room has been expanded, a process that Zefir had yet to understand how or why it happened. In his mind, the Control Center was now divided into two zones. The Mission Control area, that was the desk with the computers and other comms devices, and the War Room which consisted of a big table and chairs, these furniture he bought from a local shop in Teth-Odin.

 

At one end of this table, facing against the wall was Ingrid’s position, with a matching tall high-wing chair on wheels. This morning however, Ingrid stood as she addressed the team before they began their dungeon crawl.

“Alright, let’s talk strategies and tactics.” Ingrid began, pausing a bit to allow Philia and Zefir to lay down coffee for everyone as they sat down. Ingrid glanced at the new latest members of The Whales.

The first one was Selphie, she was a dryad which basically meant she looked like an elf with the pretty features and pointy ears as well as antler-like branches on her head. Compared to the first time she saw her, her branches were more like antlers which turned out not to be good as a healthy dryad needed foliage. Now she had her leaves back and even had small flowers blooming along her branches.

Cuddly was a Fae Marsh Hare. Like Tixi Mice they had near-sapient intelligence, probably more, as Cuddly himself was capable of using spells. Two days ago, Cuddly was rather thin and a little weak from being malnourished from his long unsuccessful journey of finding someone to adopt him as a familiar, that was until Ingrid fattened him up and adopted him. Now he sat on Sammy’s lap, busily eating a carrot.

“What’s the difference?” Zefir asked as he took his seat, Ian jumped on lap to receive cuddles which he promptly obliged.

“Strategy is long term. Tactics is short term and what you do to enact strategy.” Philia replied, giving Charles ear-scratches as the mouse quietly squeaked happily.

Ingrid nodded and continued. “Let’s talk about dividing the teams and setting who’s in charge of what. We’ve all taken a look at the Gate Houses, the fortress-like structures that surround the entrances to the dungeons. We’ve seen the injuries there and the casualties…” As she turned around, some giggled at the sight of Arthur clinging to her back, his tail wagging happily.

“It’s like Vietnam down there.” Cecil remarked. His was the opposite, he was cuddled on Chris’ and was being petted and patted by his plushy paws.

“Vietnam?” Kvaris asked, not understanding the reference, Aiden was playfully nibbling on her ears causing her to twitch and let out small titters.

“Picture the world’s greatest empire going to war against a much smaller kingdom.” Philia said as she rubbed Charles’ cheeks. “With the numbers and technology, it should be an easy win right? Instead you have thousands and thousands dead, hubris does that. You start with hopeful warriors expecting to finish their tour of duty in a few days, they find themselves trapped for weeks in a war zone where waking up the next day is just a miracle.”

“Not that it happened like that, but you get the picture.” Ingrid added, reaching up behind her to pat Arthur’s head. “That’s going to be us if we’re not prepared. Now…” Ingrid stood aside and gestured at the whiteboard behind her and began writing down names.

“We’re the Whales, that’s our entire group as a whole. Obviously, I’m the leader and Philia is XO, or second-in-command. In the field, when we’re out adventuring, so long as swords need to be drawn, Siria is in charge of those matters next to me for obvious reasons. Kinu, Kvaris, Sammy, you’re our advisers.”

The ones named by Ingrid nodded, their movements mirrored by their mice.

“Our mice have subdivisions, collectively, the mice in Cecil’s Room are known as Iroquois, while the mice on foot are known as the 189.”

“Yup, I remember that.” Sammy said. Cuddly on her lap quietly continued to chew on his carrot.

“Same.” Chorused the Enthanas. The mice assigned to that group squeaked excitedly as one.

“Cecil’s portal is manned by himself as well as the mice acting as his gunners. His group in the portal is collectively known as Iroquois. These will be divided into two subdivisions; those directly using Cecil’s portal will be team Apache, led by Cecil with Ralph as his second-in-command.”

“Roger.” Cecil replied, followed by the squeaks of his crew.

“The four sub-portals will be team Kiowa, led by Aiden.” Ingrid said and the newly-appointed Kiowa squad squeaked in reply.

“The Mice on the ground, you guys remember their team name?” Ingrid pointed to the group.

“The 189” Kinu said as she rubbed Lester’s belly.

“Yes, let’s subdivide them now. Arthur and Sully, you two will be the Montessa team, Charles and Oscar, you’re Aviz. They’re names of knight orders in my world.” Ingrid explained, now cradling Arthur, his back was turned to the group as he was reading the diagrams on the board, and his tail continued to wag.

“They did sound familiar.” Zefir remarked as he scratched Ian’s lower back “I majored in history back in college.”

“And then there's the Gold Team, consisting of course, our Golden Mice.” Ingrid continued. “Now, when we’re out dungeoneering our group will consist of three teams.”

Everyone leaned forward as Ingrid paused for effect and to rub Arthur’s back.

“Three teams will be Alpha, Center, and Omega. Alpha Team will lead the expedition, followed by Center Group, and Omega will bring up the rear.”

“Sounds simple enough.” Viel remarked, squeezing paws with Aiden, who responded by gently nibbling on her hands.

“I will lead Alpha team, Sammy, you’ll lead Omega team, and Siria, you lead Center Group.”

“Very well.” Siria replied, scratching the top of Brody’s head, causing the mouse to close his eyes and make contented chirps.

“Guess my chieftain training begins now.” Sammy smiled. Ingrid smiled back.

“Most of you will be in the Center Group; Philia, Viel, Iohann, and Neith.”

The ones Ingrid mentioned voiced their assent.

“Accompanying me on Alpha team will be Cuddly and Selphie, and Sammy for now is the sole permanent member of Omega team.”

 

“What about the rest of us?” Cecil asked, still being patty-caked by Chris’s paws.

“Good question and I was getting to that.” Ingrid said “Kinu and Kvaris, I would like you two to alternate between Alpha and Omega, your excellent sense of smell is best used at both ends of the teams as a whole.”

“Understood.” The sisters chorused.

“Montesa and Aviz I would like you two pairs to do the same, one pair will come with me, the other will follow Sammy.”

Arthur, Sully, Charles, and Oscar squeaked and saluted.

“Gold Team, you will guard the Center.”

Immediately the four gold mice squeaked.

“Finally our fourth team is Iroquois, by default you’ll follow Center Group unless we need you elsewhere.”

“Copy.” Cecil replied.

 

“Now…” Ingrid paused and made sure everyone was listening “Let’s talk about fighting. In our world when we encounter something we aren’t sure isn't the enemy we usually identify ourselves first and tell them what they should do. Philia, can you give a sample?”

“Yeah…” Philia replied “Halt! We’re The Whales! Show yourself or we will attack! Something like that?”

“Yup, that will do.”

“I got the bullhorn though, so I guess I’ll be doing that most of the time.” Cecil remarked.

“Now if a fight breaks out,” Ingrid continued, “Selphie, shoot the first enemy you see, then everyone gathers around the Center Group. Sammy, Kinu, and Kvaris, you three will form a new sub-group, let’s call you-”

Kvaris interrupted with “Valkyrie”

“Oh those warrior goddesses, Philia told us about.” Sammy smiled, “I like that name.”

“Valkyries it is.” Ingrid said. “You three will intercept anyone who gets past me or if a new front breaks out.”

“Affirmative.” Kinu replied.

“Montesa and Aviz, provide them fire support. Gold team, keep sending your simulacrums to assist them, but you yourselves focus on protecting the center.”

The mice squeaked in response, pumping their paws in the air.

“Siria, Philia, and Cuddly, provide ranged support to those who need it most, that’s usually the Valkyries, Iohann you’re our last line of defense. Deploy your Nyx Fish Yogzolom at your discretion.”

“You know I can YOLO a bit.” Philia said, “I have a recalling charm that lets me teleport back to Neith if something does try to go through my protection.”

Ingrid paused, “Very well, but don’t push it.” She then turned to Cuddly, “Cuddly, if possible, use your Fae Harriers to harass the most powerful enemy you see, keep it distracted.”

The big hare cutely wheeked in reply.

“As for Iroquois, Apache will focus on clearing out the thickest mobs possible.” Ingrid said. “Kiowa will provide fire support where needed. As for me, I’ll obviously fight the most dangerous battles.”

Ingrid paused as everyone digested the information.

“Selphie.” Ingrid began. “So long as the fight is going on, don’t be shy about using up your wood pellets to make Whipcrawlers, we can always make more. Always have one or two around to keep the monsters infighting.”

“Understood, Ingrid!” Selphie said, imitating the mice’s salute.

“Also, we have Neith controlling the drones Aquila and Falcis. Aquila will be scouting ahead and Falcis will help watch the rear. In addition we have Zefir and Gwen who will at times pilot Oberon and Titania respectively to scout ahead for areas of interest.”

“Now…” Ingrid said after finishing her coffee. “Any questions?”

Everyone shook their heads.

“Right.” Ingrid continued “Now, let’s assign a callsign for Selphie, suggestions?”

Philia raised a hand, Ingrid frowned “Not Yggdrasil, please!”

“I was gonna say Suika on account of her antler-like branches on her head.” Philia said.

“Suika it is.” Ingrid declared, “unless anyone has other ideas.”

There were none.

“Very well, let’s get breakfast!” Ingrid told the team. “Then we check our equipment and start earning.”

 

\_\_\_

“Take care out there…” Zefir said, holding the door open. He was meowing and purring as the girls gave him a quick smooch or hug on the way out. The mice and Cuddly were already lined up at the patio, they’ve really taken to those clips of soldiers lining up for inspection as Arthur, Charles, and Gerald checked each of their teammates’s rifles and armor.

“No heroics please!” He called. Ingrid waved back at him, Philia blew a kiss, and the Enthana sisters and Sammy bared toothy grins and the rest made their acknowledgements in return. As the team stepped out of the boundary; Autumnhollow’s Wolia guardians, Amalla and Kaolla tapped their chests with a fist as a warrior’s sign of regards and watched them go.

And then the team headed out.

As they passed by the storefront, Mink and Roofe waved back, having taken the right-most shop, next to the gate. It was slow-going on the first day but the two kobolds reported an increase in sales the following day due to the novelty. Arek had supplied them with the cans that had a pull-on tab as nobody had a can opener in this world and had taken out all the labelling and replaced them with a generic sticker. The two ciltran errand-boys from Irons, Bryce and Bosco happily called out to them, wishing the team a “fortunate quest.” Ingrid couldn’t help but want to give the four a quick snuggle, especially with the two fluffy dog-people.

“Keep your earpieces on.” Ingrid said quietly to Mink and Roofe. “Let us know if anything happens.”

The two adorable dogs nodded.

**Storm Gate Fortress, Teth-Odin:**

The Storm Gate Fortress was one of the forts that surrounded the entrance to Teth-Odin dungeons below. Some have called it a “reverse fortress” as it was meant to prevent monsters from coming out as opposed to keeping them out. High crenelated walls provided archers and mages a way to safely rain shots and spells into the courtyard below to stem a theoretical outbreak.

 

That morning, The Whales saw the same sobering scene as two days prior. The once brave and boasting adventurers outside were replaced with a sight of the injured and the lifeless. The banter and clapped hands over shoulders outside the walls were replaced inside with the desperate pleas for their friend to hold on; the hand held in theirs no longer returned the squeeze. The friendly arguments of who could better in the dungeons of Teth-Odin were replaced with lone explorers belting out wails of regret and despair.

Teams of big burly trolls industriously hauled monster carcasses and the dead into the courtyard.

Elsewhere, teams of healers triaged the survivors. More than a few adventurers were held back by their friends, demanding angrily, desperately to go back and see if they could save those who sacrificed themselves so they could escape.

One pair of adventurers, badly beaten, staggered along, gasping and laughing on how they made it. It was clear however that his companion was not going to live long but he continued to speak hopefully as they made their way to a healer running over to them. Ingrid saw the healer take his barely conscious friend away. The man, glad to see his friend attended to, slumped to the floor and ceased moving. He had spent every ounce of his remaining vitality to make sure his friend would live.

In one corner a group of badly beaten up survivors were chuckling amongst themselves, talking animatedly about how they’ve cheated death. One then suggested they hit the tavern and as they stood up and left, they noticed one of their own still slumped on the wall. The laughs of elation turned to screams of despair as they realized one of their friends had succumbed to his wounds.

 

“We’ll make it,” Ingrid assured everybody. She glanced again at the two latest members of the team. Cuddly and Selphie now bore amulets that let them take advantage of the Rhokalian Dress Form’s carbon-fiber-like vest. They also had tac-cams and earpieces on as well as Traveler’s valises with the standard Everyday Carry as everyone else. For bags; Selfie opted for a purse with a short strap, while Cuddly bore a small backpack.

For weapons, Cuddly’s wand was improved on while Selphie now had a wooden repeating pellet gun. Flowers and vines grew on it, with the latter capable of reaching into her belt pack to refill its ammo. Both wore small bucklers on their hand, enchanted with the Pavise charm which Ingrid learned meant they basically had a forcefield the size and toughness of a thick wooden door.

Ingrid smiled, they both looked healthy and well equipped. At least as well equipped as they would be, she planned to give the two armor later on, something like the ones Siria used perhaps, but that was a concern for a later time…

 

Aside from the scenes of tragedy was commerce and hope. Various stalls were lined up offering protection charms, weapon repairs, and other supplies such as rations for a long stay in the dungeons below. Adventurers orphaned from their teams mixed and matched up, more than a few planning mutual vengeance against the monsters that destroyed their former teams. There were also food stalls where people were either refueling after a hard expedition into the depths below or those who had skipped their breakfast.

 

There was a queue for the gate itself, a formality and a measure against… as Philia called it “stupid drama from the vultures” and as a way to help with the loss of party members if not an entire team as a result. Siria handled the process, as she was once a staff member of the Fenrir Guild, although she took Ingrid and Philia with her in order to show what paperwork needed to be done.

“Fortunately we don’t have to do this often.” Siria explained as Ingrid signed the last page.

“What about those who just walked in without waiting on cue?” Ingrid asked as she filled out the pages.

“Those are…” Siria paused.

“Some of them don’t intend to come back…” Philia said.

 

Inside was the Antechamber, it was guarded by “S-Rank” adventurers, the last line of defense of the dungeon interior against the swarming hordes of monsters below. Priests of various faiths were also present, bestowing blessings each according to their beliefs. Ingrid felt a touch of magical energy ripple through her body, she looked at Siria.

“How long do these last?” Ingrid asked quietly.

“We have an hour.” Siria replied. “They’re not much though, so as not to contradict the protections we already have.”

As they walked through the cavernous antechamber, a throat-singing minotaur was rendering blessings from above. Various adventurer teams were also laying votive offerings in the various altars of the room, some were candles, others were bundles of incense, while another laid down carved stones.

With that, everyone had dispersed to the alcoves of their faiths to make a short prayer. Ingrid and Philia merely clasped their hands, as they didn’t know which deity had brought them here.

“The entrances are different from the exits.” Siria explained as she came back, “This is to ensure those who need to leave immediately aren’t hampered.”

“*Huh, so that’s why we’re not seeing anyone coming up.*” Zefir said

 

The passage from the Antechamber led down to more steps below, it was a large donut-shaped chamber. Ahead a large pair of doors remained sealed shut, depicting two war gods.

“That leads directly to the dungeons below, but we won’t use those, those are reserved for major incursions by armies.” Siria explained. “We will take one-way teleporters that lead to the Inner Sanctum of the first level. For our exit, we will emerge from those postern-like doors.” Siria said, pointing to smaller but still imposing doors. They were open and were manned by guildsmen who kept a watchful eye. As they walked along Ingrid glimpsed a group of adventurers making their way up, their voices tired but elated. It seems at the very least they didn’t lose anybody.

 

“Kvaris, Montessa, up front. Kinu, Aviz, link up with Sammy.” Ingrid said quietly as Siria selected a teleporter for them to use. Like the others they passed by, each was a large arched alcove, a short platform held up a frame of gold-plated orihalcum.

“We activate this portal by putting a bit of our energy into it, only one has to do it, afterwards it stays open for twenty seconds.” Siria said. She then pointed at the walls of the alcove which showed a map of the dungeon as well as where they would pop up.

 

Turning to the group, Ingrid quietly told everyone “Last chance, check your gear and then we go in.”

The Iroquois mice checked their caddy-mounted devices and made sure they were secured. Those with shields made sure they were strapped on properly and everyone checked their armor was properly on. The Valkyrie squad due to being equipped with Apport rings didn’t need to summon their weapons yet.

Meanwhile, there was a distinct “click” as the 189 unlatched their guns’ safety.

“Ready?” Ingrid asked as she tightened her gloves.

“Ready!” Everyone chorused.

Ingrid stepped forward and channeled a small amount of mana into her finger as Siria directed, right into the middle of the empty space around the orihalcum frame. The air around it thrummed and rippled before turning into a portal showing the room ahead of them.

Siria frowned.

“Looks a lot dimmer than usual…” she said, peering into the portal and seeing the corridor head of it nearly pitch-black. “Viel, Cuddly, ready your illumination spells, cast them once you get in.”

“Let’s go then!” Ingrid asked, putting more energy to extend the portal’s uptime.

Ingrid, Cecil, and Philia rushed in first, followed by the mice, then everyone else in short order.

The Expedition had begun.

Here is the post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/OverSimplified/comments/146a4x8/if\_oversimplified\_made\_a\_video\_on\_the\_spanish/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverSimplified/comments/146a4x8/if_oversimplified_made_a_video_on_the_spanish/)

Commenters were not very impressed.

AI has gotten a lot better in the past year. Also have been working on getting AI to be ""funny"" since about mid-2020 (it was VERY hard to do back then, but I had some success. I even bought the domain ""Hilarious.ai"" and was planning to build something for a while. But it is a LOT easier to make it funny these days).

More on why I decided to do this below.

But first, here is the new script I got the AI to write. Would love to head what people think of this version:

-=-=-=

Alright, buckle up, because we’re about to dive into the Spanish-American War—a war that lasted about as long as a Netflix binge, but managed to change a ton of stuff. No spoilers though… wait, actually, all spoilers. Let’s do this.





**PART 1: Cuba’s Like, “I Want Out!”**





Picture this: it’s the late 1800s, and Cuba’s a colony of Spain, but things aren’t exactly going great. Imagine living with your parents forever, and now they’re making you mow the lawn *and* take out the trash. Yeah, Cuba’s not having it. The people want independence—freedom, liberty, and probably some good coffee. Meanwhile, Spain’s like, “Nope. You’re staying in this house as long as you’re under our empire!” Cue the teenage rebellion: Cuba launches a full-blown fight for independence.





Now, who’s watching all of this from the sidelines? That’s right—the United States, munching popcorn like, “Hmm… freedom? Independence? Those are my favorite things!” America was kinda into the idea of Cuba ditching Spain, especially since Cuba was right next door. It’s like your neighbor’s having a noisy breakup, and you can’t help but get involved.





**PART 2: The Maine Event (Get it? The “Maine” Event?)**





Enter the USS Maine, the star of this whole show. Picture a massive American battleship just chilling in Havana Harbor, being all intimidating and minding its own business. Then, BOOM! The ship explodes like someone cranked the volume on a Michael Bay movie. **Kablam!** Everyone’s looking around like, “Wait… who did that?!”





America immediately points at Spain. “It was totally them!” The press—imagine it like the Twitter of 1898—goes wild with headlines screaming, “REMEMBER THE MAINE! TO HELL WITH SPAIN!” It’s basically trending worldwide. Tensions skyrocket, and the US is looking for a reason to throw some hands. Well, this was it.





**PART 3: War? Why Not! Let’s Go!**





April 1898. The US declares war on Spain, and suddenly it’s like the Wild West but with battleships and bayonets. The US Navy heads over to the Caribbean and the Pacific, all while probably playing some epic battle music in their heads.





First up, the **Battle of Manila Bay**. Admiral George Dewey, the guy in charge, rolls up to the Philippines—another Spanish colony—looks at the Spanish fleet, and says, “You’re gonna want to remember this day.” Long story short, he wipes them out before breakfast. One might say Dewey *did* it. (I know, terrible pun, moving on.)





But the fun doesn’t stop there. Over in Cuba, you’ve got future president and all-around adventurer Theodore Roosevelt. The guy’s basically Captain America before there was a Captain America. Teddy, along with his Rough Riders (which sounds like a biker gang but it’s really just a bunch of cowboys and polo players), charges up **San Juan Hill** like they’re in a superhero movie. Picture slow motion, dust flying, dramatic music… and somehow Roosevelt’s mustache looking *perfect* the whole time. The US wins, and Teddy becomes a living legend. Cue the fanfare.





**PART 4: The Afterparty (Also Known As, “Treaty of Paris”)**





So, by the end of 1898, Spain’s like, “Okay, okay, we give up! You win!” They sign the **Treaty of Paris**, and the US walks away with a bunch of Spain’s former colonies—Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. It’s like Spain just handed over the keys to a bunch of cool new territories and said, “Here, you take care of them now.” And America’s like, “Don’t mind if I do!”





This war basically launches the US into full-on imperial mode, like they just unlocked a new level in the game of world powers. Suddenly, the US isn’t just a scrappy, young country anymore—it’s flexing its muscles on the global stage like, “Yeah, I lift.”





**PART 5: So What Did We Learn?**





So, what was the Spanish-American War all about? Well, it was short, sweet, and packed with action, like the world’s most intense trailer for a summer blockbuster. But it was also about something bigger—America stepping into the spotlight as a major player in world politics. And Teddy Roosevelt? He went on to become president and basically wrestled bears for fun. (Okay, maybe not *literally*, but would you be surprised?)





So, that’s the Spanish-American War! Explosions, mustaches, and a whole lot of history packed into a few crazy months. Remember the Maine? Heck, remember this whole war—it was a game-changer. And hey, if you learned something new, you can thank Admiral Dewey… or just eat some more popcorn. Until next time!





That’s how it’s done—boom, done, war over!

WHY I AM DOING THIS:

I found this old post this morning. I am working with / coaching my 9-year old daughter as she is trying to compete in the National History Bee. She likes the Oversimplified Videos as a starting point to learn about a specific event or person (then I use ChatGPT to summarize the most important facts someone competing in the Bee should remember, then she films a short clip for Instagram ""Teaching"" other kids what those facts are, then I add those facts into a Anki deck, which she reviews every morning).

After reading what I managed to get AI to generate for the Spanish American War, we may change how she does the Instagram posts into something like this script....

It was crowded, and I was in the zone when I noticed a group of young adults at a nearby table making fun of a person sitting alone. She had a unique style—bright hair and bold accessories—but they were relentless in their teasing.

At first, I hesitated. I thought about how awkward it would be to intervene. But as I watched the woman’s face fall, I felt a surge of anger. I decided enough was enough. I stood up and approached their table, asking them if they could keep their comments to themselves.

Surprisingly, they fell silent, and I could feel all eyes on me. I turned to the woman and told her that I thought she looked amazing and that her style was inspiring. She smiled shyly, and I could see the relief wash over her.

After that, the group dispersed, and the woman came over to thank me. We ended up chatting for a while, sharing stories about our lives. That moment taught me the power of standing up for others and how a little kindness can go a long way.",1,1728472178.0,AnyIncident,0,1.0,False

Nostalgia hit hard as I wandered the streets, reminiscing about my childhood. One afternoon, I walked by our old elementary school. On a whim, I decided to go inside and see if anyone remembered me.

As I strolled through the familiar halls, I stumbled upon the gym where we used to have recess. Suddenly, I heard a voice behind me. I turned around, and to my astonishment, it was Sarah—my best friend from those days. We both stood there in disbelief, laughing and hugging each other like no time had passed.

We spent the next few hours catching up over coffee, sharing stories about our lives and families. It felt surreal to reconnect after all those years. We made plans to keep in touch and promised not to let so much time pass before our next meeting. That day reminded me how valuable old friendships can be, and it reignited a sense of connection that I hadn’t felt in years.",1,1728472144.0,AnyIncident,0,1.0,False

So, you think you know coffee? Think again. Brewing coffee has gone from a simple pour-and-go affair to a near art form. With a blend of tech and tradition, today’s coffee scene has evolved into a world of precise temperatures, specialized gear, and diverse flavors. Forget the days of bitter brews and instant coffee; modern techniques can turn your kitchen into a specialty coffee shop if you know the ropes.

Ready to dive into the world of *precision brewing*? This guide will take you through the top modern coffee brewing techniques, answer your burning questions, and help you pick up a few pro tips to get that café-quality coffee at home. Let’s start brewing!

# The Techniques: Your Essential Guide to Modern Coffee Brewing

# 1. The Pour-Over Method: Precision Meets Flavor

You’ve probably seen pour-overs at your local hipster café, but it’s not just for show. The pour-over method, popularized by brands like Chemex and Hario V60, allows you to control every single aspect of your brew. Want a stronger cup? Adjust your pour rate or water temperature. Looking for a smoother taste? Alter the grind size.

**How it Works:**

* Place a filter in the dripper, set it over a mug or carafe, and add coffee grounds.
* Slowly pour hot water over the grounds in a circular motion, pausing to let the coffee “bloom” (this releases CO2 and enhances flavor).

**Why it Works:** Pour-over provides unmatched control, allowing coffee lovers to adjust for flavor notes. It’s perfect for single-origin beans where you want to taste the bean’s natural profile.

**Pro Tip:** Try a water-to-coffee ratio of about 16:1 for optimal flavor.

# 2. The AeroPress: Quick, Portable, and Smooth

The AeroPress is a cult favorite among coffee enthusiasts and travelers alike. This compact device uses air pressure to push hot water through coffee grounds, giving you a rich, espresso-like taste without any fancy machinery.

**How it Works:**

* Add coffee grounds to the AeroPress, pour in hot water, stir, and then press the plunger down slowly.

**Why it Works:** The rapid pressure forces water through the grounds, resulting in a short brewing time that minimizes bitterness and maximizes smoothness. It’s known for its versatility—brew it short for espresso-style or long for an Americano vibe.

**Pro Tip:** Experiment with the “inverted method” (brewing upside-down) for even richer flavors.

# 3. Cold Brew: Cool, Strong, and Ready-to-Go

Cold brew has exploded in popularity, and for good reason. It’s refreshing, less acidic, and super easy to make in bulk. Unlike traditional brewing methods, cold brew coffee is made with cold or room temperature water and a much longer extraction time—anywhere from 12 to 24 hours.

**How it Works:**

* Mix coffee grounds with cold water, let it steep in the fridge for 12+ hours, then strain.

**Why it Works:** The cold extraction process reduces acidity, giving a naturally sweet taste. Plus, the concentrated result can be diluted with water or milk for an extra-smooth, mellow finish.

**Pro Tip:** Use a coarser grind for cold brew to avoid sediment. Aim for a 1:4 coffee-to-water ratio for a strong concentrate.

# 4. The Siphon: Science Meets Coffee

If you’re a fan of dramatic brewing, the siphon method is for you. This method uses vapor pressure and vacuum techniques to brew coffee. It’s like a science experiment in your kitchen, and it delivers a full-bodied cup.

**How it Works:**

* Water in the bottom chamber is heated until it vaporizes and pushes up to mix with coffee grounds in the upper chamber. When the heat source is removed, brewed coffee filters back down to the bottom.

**Why it Works:** The siphon provides a unique, clean taste because of its full immersion and precise filtering. Each step is visible, making it as much of an experience as it is a brew method.

**Pro Tip:** Control the temperature and brewing time carefully—ideal siphon brewing sits around 93°C (200°F) for 2-4 minutes.

# 5. Espresso Machines: The Classic Powerhouse

Espresso is the foundation of countless coffee drinks (think lattes, cappuccinos, Americanos), and an espresso machine delivers intense, concentrated coffee by forcing hot water through finely-ground beans. While home espresso machines require an upfront investment, their versatility and quality are unparalleled.

**How it Works:**

* Coffee grounds are tightly packed, then high-pressure water is forced through, producing a small, concentrated shot.

**Why it Works:** The intense pressure extracts a rich, full-bodied flavor in seconds. Plus, you get that beloved “crema” layer on top for added texture.

**Pro Tip:** Play with your grind size—finer for a stronger shot, slightly coarser for less intensity.

# 6. Single-Serve Machines: Convenience and Consistency

Single-serve machines like the Keurig and Nespresso have become household staples. They’re fast, easy, and offer a variety of flavors and strengths. While they’re not the most customizable option, they guarantee a consistent cup every time.

**How it Works:**

* Insert a pre-packaged pod, press a button, and hot water flows through the pod to deliver your coffee.

**Why it Works:** Convenience! You get a quick cup without any cleanup. Although single-serve machines might lack the depth of flavor, they’re perfect for busy mornings.

**Pro Tip:** Descale regularly and try a reusable pod for a more eco-friendly option.

# 7. French Press: The Rich, Bold Brew

Ah, the French press—beloved for its simplicity and depth of flavor. Using a metal mesh filter instead of paper, it allows more of the coffee oils into your cup, giving you a richer, fuller taste.

**How it Works:**

* Add coffee grounds to hot water, let steep for 4 minutes, and press the plunger down to separate grounds from the coffee.

**Why it Works:** French press coffee is robust and retains oils, giving it a heavy body. Great for dark roasts or anyone who loves a bold flavor.

**Pro Tip:** Use a coarse grind to avoid a muddy texture, and aim for a 1:15 coffee-to-water ratio for best results.

# FAQs About Modern Coffee Brewing Techniques

**Q: Which brewing method is best for beginners?**  
*Answer:* Single-serve machines or a French press are great for beginners. They’re straightforward, require little equipment, and still deliver a solid cup.

**Q: Does grind size really matter?**  
*Answer:* Absolutely! Grind size directly affects extraction. A finer grind gives a stronger, more intense brew, while coarser grinds are best for longer brewing times (like cold brew or French press).

**Q: How much should I spend on brewing equipment?**  
*Answer:* Start simple. A quality pour-over setup or AeroPress costs under $50. If you’re really into espresso, an entry-level machine is around $300, but high-end models go well over $1,000.

**Q: Can I reuse coffee grounds?**  
*Answer:* Technically, yes, but expect weaker coffee. Most grounds lose their flavor after one brew.

**Q: Is filtered water really necessary?**  
*Answer:* It’s a game-changer. Filtered water removes impurities that can alter your coffee’s taste. Try it and you’ll notice the difference!

# Conclusion

There you have it! Modern coffee brewing is all about exploring new methods and finding what suits your taste. Whether you love the precision of pour-over, the richness of French press, or the convenience of a single-serve machine, there’s no shortage of ways to level up your coffee game. So grab your beans, pick a method, and start experimenting.

Remember, the perfect cup of coffee doesn’t come from a single method—it comes from finding your method. Happy brewing!",1,1728471794.0,thecaffeinehit,0,1.0,False

i have been brewing coffee at home for about a year now. It all started last year in august when i was gifted an aeropress. Shortly after that i bought a 2nd hand baratza sette 30. I have been getting more and more frustated with how the baratza works. So in have been eyeing a new grinder. I dont have the funds atm to go for sth like timemore 078, so i decided on a hand grinder. Problem is, i dont really know what i like in my coffee.

I mainly drink coffee roasted at [SYRA](https://syra.coffee/) (Spain). Some coffees are extremely good, some i can barely go through one bag. How do i know, without trying different grinders, what kind of ""taste"" do i have. Will i like the higher clarity of 1zpresso ZP6 or is better to go down some other path?

Normally i do like more thin, sweeter coffees. I am mostly brewing light and medium roasts with v60 and aeropress.

And kind of info would be greatly appreciated.",1,1728471551.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

Staying organized helps reduce stress and keeps you on top of your workload.
2. **Set SMART Goals**: Make sure your goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This helps you focus on realistic targets and motivates you to achieve them.
3. **Take Notes Efficiently**: Learn to take notes in a way that works for you—whether it’s traditional handwriting or using digital apps like OneNote or Notion. Focus on key concepts, not word-for-word transcription. Cornell Notes or mind mapping can be really helpful for reviewing later.
4. **Practice Active Learning**: Instead of passively reading or highlighting, try techniques like summarizing, teaching the material to someone else, or creating flashcards (Quizlet is great for this). Active engagement helps solidify information in your memory.
5. **Find Your Best Study Routine**: Figure out when and where you study best. Some people are night owls, while others are more productive in the morning. Experiment with different environments (library, coffee shop, home) to find what works for you.
6. **Don’t Procrastinate**: Easier said than done, right? Try using the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of work, 5-minute break) or break your tasks into smaller steps. Getting started is usually the hardest part!
7. **Stay Healthy**: Your mental and physical health are just as important as academics. Eat well, get enough sleep (seriously, don’t pull all-nighters!), and exercise regularly. A healthy body supports a healthy mind.
8. **Form Study Groups**: Studying with friends or classmates can help you learn more effectively. Teaching each other, discussing concepts, and sharing resources are all great ways to deepen your understanding of the material.
9. **Take Regular Breaks**: Your brain needs time to rest! Use breaks to recharge—go for a walk, stretch, grab a snack, or listen to some music. Short breaks can boost productivity and help you avoid burnout.
10. **Ask for Help**: Don’t be afraid to ask your professors, TAs, or classmates for help if you’re stuck. Most people are happy to assist, and universities often offer free resources like tutoring centers, writing labs, or academic advisors.
11. **Balance Study and Social Life**: It’s important to balance your academic life with time for relaxation and socializing. Hanging out with friends, exploring hobbies, and taking time to relax helps maintain your mental health.
12. **Manage Stress**: College can be overwhelming, so find ways to manage stress—whether through meditation, journaling, exercising, or just spending time with loved ones. If things get too tough, don’t hesitate to reach out for support or counseling.
13. **Stay Curious**: Don’t focus only on passing exams—try to stay genuinely curious about what you’re studying. Dive deeper into topics that interest you, explore related subjects, and ask questions. This makes learning more enjoyable and meaningful.
14. **Reward Yourself**: When you complete a big task or finish an exam, give yourself a small reward! It can be something simple like watching an episode of your favorite show, treating yourself to a snack, or taking a day off. Positive reinforcement helps keep you motivated.

*June 29, 2024* 

I (23F) am engaged to John (24M). We are together for 5 years. We want to get married in july 2025. I always thought that his family liked me because we get along well.  He has two older brothers (26M,29M), both married.  Honestly, I was very excited to have them all as my in laws. They were always kind to me.

Some kind of important information: About a year ago when I was scrolling on instagram I saw a profile that was kind of cringy but in a cute way. It was an older woman’s profile who shared inspirational quotes. I remember one particular post and it was something in the lines of „Only stupid people pretend to know everything. Don’t pretend. Just ask”. Honestly this quote changed me in a lot of ways. Before that I was always worried that I might embarrass myself if I don’t know something and after reading that quote I realized that if I always pretend that I know everything then I’ll miss out on actually getting to learn about things. So I decided to change my habits and start admitting that sometimes I genuinely don’t know. Someone is talking about the war in Kosovo? Okay sure but first let me ask some questions so I can really understand what we’re talking about.  And I ask a lot of questions sometimes. 

I sometimes even open the notes app and write in some questions that I later want to find answers to. These are my latest:

1. How does the time work in the black hole?
2. Why some snails have shells and others don’t????
3. What food is okay for ducks?
4. How does the light bulb work (the old ones with gas inside them)?
5. Does everyone see colours the same? and How can we know that??

Sorry for the long introduction, but it was kind of necessary for understanding what kind of person I am. I know that sometimes I might come across as annoying. 

Now onto the problem: his parents hosted a small barbecue last weekend only for the family. So it was the mom (54F), dad (59M), brothers (26M, 29M) and their wives (27F, 27F). I was the last person who showed up because I had to work late. I entered the house and when I was walking towards the back of the house into the backyard I heard John’s mom talking about me. To be honest she wasn’t talking about me, more like mocking me. I heard her say in a high pitched voice „How does the sun work? Where should I put the fork? Why does nobody like me? How do I wipe my ass?”. I just stood there. I had this sinking feeling. I couldn’t move, so I just stood there. And I heard them all laughing. One of the wives said „I actually don’t mind her always asking questions. I think it’s cute” and it made me feel hopeful that they will say something like „yeah sure we’re just playing, we love that”. But none of them did. Instead the mom replied „It’s not cute. She’s just stupid.” After that they laughed again. I heard John laughing. My heart kind of broke in that moment because he didn’t even say one positive thing. He didn’t defend me. He just laughed. I quietly turned around and left the house. I texted John that I got sick and have to stay home. Now I’m wondering how should I approach this situation. 

We live together and I sleep in the guest bedroom for now and I use the excuse that I don’t want him to get sick from being around me. I can’t ignore him forever and I can’t pretend to be sick anymore, because it’s been too long. 

I’m not sure how do i proceed. Maybe it was just a misunderstanding. I’m considering talking to them about this, but I’m also worried that they won’t be honest with me. I can’t marry him if he really thinks I’m stupid. But I also can’t marry into a family who think so little of me. But maybe it was a joke and I shouldn’t take it so seriously… I’m so torn apart and everyday I convince myself a bit more that it’s okay and sometimes we should all laugh about ourselves. Now i feel like i’m just going crazy. I would really appreciate some advice.

Tldr; Overheard future MIL calling me stupid and my fiancé laughed. Considering leaving him. I’m wondering if it might be just a joke and maybe a misunderstanding. Need advice on how to navigate the situation. 


EDIT: There are many comments saying that they cannot stand people like me. I agree that sometimes I can be a bit too much with the questions, but with that being said I still think I’m within reason. I don’t do it around people I just met, I rarely do it at parties or other gatherings. I usually do it with people who are close to me - who I think wouldn’t judge me or with people who specifically have knowledge about something and are willing to share it. If Im a part of a conversation - I’m not rude and i’m not interrupting, I usually just ask one or two questions. If a discussion is about the climate change I’m not asking about monkeys if you know what I’m saying. I’m also not a complete dumbass. I don’t ask questions which generally would be considered dumb to other people. Those I just write in the notes and check answers later in the internet. I’m capable of reading so I make good use of it. But after all I still do ask questions a lot.

*July 3, 2024, 4 days later*

First of all, I wanted to say thank you to people who reached out to answer my questions about black holes, snails, ducks, light bulbs and other stuff. I would love to have you as my friends.

For the other people who said I should just shut up - I don’t really care if you find me annoying or hard to be around. I’m okay with that. I don’t exist to please everyone. I’m just here for a good time, have my own interests and learn.

I didn’t expect my post to gain so much attention but I’m so grateful for the advice. Most of you told me to break up with him and at the very least confront him, so that’s what I decided to do. You gave me a push and confidence to do it.

But before I did that, I texted the wife of John’s brother, the one who said she liked me asking questions. I asked if we can meet up for coffee. She said sure.

We met and I didn’t see the point in pretending to her that I didn’t hear their conversation. So after some small talk I just said „I heard you all talking about me during the bbq”. She immediately got sad and said she feels embarrassed. She explained that it wasn’t a joke, wasn’t out of context, that it was just mean and hurtful. She said she’s sorry for not defending me more, but I said that’s it’s okay and I understand. I told her that I don’t blame her for anything, and just wanted to make sure that I understand the situation and see it for what it really was.. And it really was laughing about me behind my back. Just bullying.

At this point I just had to confront John. In my last post so many comments were saying that he will probably try gaslighting me. And you were right.

We were having dinner together for the first time since the bbq happened, because before I tried my best to avoid him. (Yes, I know, not very mature of me, but other than you guys I don’t really have a strong support system. My family and best friends are hundreds of kilometers away. I only have two good friends here) I was so stressed I thought I’m going to pass out. My legs were shaking and I was terrified because I knew deep down that this is the moment when my five year relationship goes down the drain.

I looked him in the eyes and asked „How does the sun work?”. He looked confused, so I followed with „Where should I put my fork? Why does nobody like me?” At this point realization hit him and he started nervously laughing. I said I was there and I heard them. After the initial shock passed, he got mad. He said its rude to eavesdrop. I said it’s rude to bully people.

He tried telling me that it was just a joke. That I shouldn’t be so uptight. That it really was funny. I said that I didn’t find it funny and went to the guest to calm down. He started panicking. He was asking me to please talk to him. He was much more apologetic and said that he will be 100% honest with me. I asked if his mother made similar comments before the bbq. He said yes. I asked him if he ever defended me. He said he tries to. I don’t know if I believe him. He told me he loves me and respects me. I don’t know if I believe it either.

I said that I love him too, but I need a break. He’s all I ever known. He was my first and only partner. I have no outside perspective of this, I have no experience. I need a moment to think. I will be going to my friends house for a while to think everything through. The apartment has his name on the lease anyway.

After I gathered some of my things and left, he kept texting me non stop. He tried calling but I didn’t respond. I was very hurt because he tried to belittle my feelings and only later when he realised that I might break up with him, started apologising.

The next day I decided to give him another chance to explain himself and I came back to the apartment. He seemed very sad and tired. He said that he told his mother that I overheard them. I said I don’t care. It’s his time to step up and show me that he cares, I’m not interested in a apology from his mother. I’m already done with her. I can’t put up with this behaviour and mocking me like we’re in primary school.

I saw a comment saying that probably her ego is hurting. I think it’s true. She never got the chance or never had desire to have an education. She is a very good home maker but outside of that she doesn’t have many interests of her own. If I’m asking her about making tomato soup she will be talking for 30 minutes lecturing me about adding enough sugar, but not too much. She will lecture anyone who is willing to listen. But anytime someone is talking about something she’s not familiar with - she gets defensive and try to imply that nobody cares about that and if its not relevant to her, it shouldn’t be discussed.

Once again he tried telling me that I should relax because it was only a joke and at this point I had enough. I took of my ring and told him that his behaviour is a joke and I can’t be the punch line. I told him that I wish him and his family the best and to look in the mirror to check if they really are as superior as they think they are. I said I’m going to be back with my friend soon to pick up the rest of my stuff and to not contact me again unless it’s about moving my things out.

And that’s it. I’m done. Thank you all for the advice. Without you I wouldn’t have the confidence to leave this man. I know I deserve better. I can’t be with someone who can’t stand up for me, and I wouldn’t be able to feel comfortable around his family, so I’m done with the relationship. I hope they will treat his next girlfriend better. Thank you again reddit for advice!

>#Comment by OOP:

- 

My ex texts me multiple times a day. After I get all of my things back I will block him immediately. But the pattern of behaviour is almost the same every day. In the morning I receive a very long message that he’s so so sorry and when I don’t reply it slowly starts to anger him so in the evening it’s much more passive aggressive and basically the last message of the day is usually something like „you can’t take a joke, you should grow some balls” or „your loss, bitch”. And then the next morning, the cycle starts again and he’s sorry about the message he sent before and that he didn’t mean to. Pretty exhausting to be honest. But it doesn’t hurt me as much as I thought it would. Even though I’m still not over him and I still love him, his behaviour continues to show me that I made the right decision.

*September 28, 2024, 3 months later*

It’s been some time since I posted the last time so I thought I’m gonna give you guys a small update, because some people still keep messaging me. I appreciate all the kind words.

Sooo I got my own apartment now! I lived with my friend for a while and she was an amazing support for me after the break up, but now I have my own place closer to my university and work.

Turns out my ex fiancé didn’t tell his family that we broke up. I blocked them all except for the ex (because we needed to keep in touch in order to get my stuff from the apartment that we shared) and nice SIL, and a week after the break up she texted me and asked when I will come to the parents house because everyone wants to apologize. I called her and said that we’re no longer together and I don’t really want their apology. She seemed shocked because my ex was telling them that “we’re fine, she just needs some time”. Ex SIL told me that the family is still fighting over this whole ordeal and that the brothers are giving my ex a hard time about the situation. I told her nicely that I don’t really want any updates. I like her, but I cannot put my energy towards following their every move. She told me she understands. I don’t know what happened after that with them.

I’m happy, I went on a date with a cute guy I met in a cafe, but I’m taking everything slow and I don’t want to rush any relationship. I’m not ready because just three months ago I was planning a wedding and right now I’m single and focusing on studying and work. When I graduate I want to adopt a kitten, and that’s my only goal in terms of any big commitment right now! :)

I also enrolled in CS50 by HarvardX and I recommend you all to try and learn something new today!

If you have any questions then feel free to ask and I will try to answer in the comments.

I think even though the brothers still think what the family said during the bbq was funny, they are giving my ex a hard time because he “let a good one go” or something like that. They don’t think they were in the wrong but they’re making fun of him for not standing up for me and they’re laughing at the fact that I broke up with him and he didn’t even have the balls to tell them.

One of them said that if someone called his wife stupid, he would defend her even if she would’ve done something dumb.

* 

Yeah, the love faded really fast. I didn’t expect it. The attachment to him is still there, but I very quickly stopped feeling love for him when I fully realised that he sees me as stupid and at the very least not on his level.

- 

Yeah after a week and a half I was done picking up my stuff. I tried not to be petty and take my silverware for example and not give him a reason to get mad. I didn’t want to come alone so I only went when my friend had the time to help me. He did get mad when I took my air fryer (he loved it more than anything) haha. I blocked him after I took everything that was mine.

1fzodmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXADHD/comments/1fzodmk/how_to_quit_smokingvaping/,How to quit smoking/vaping,"Hello ladies! I’m a 23 year old woman and as shameful as it might sound, I picked up smoking cigarettes at around 15. It’s pretty common in my country unfortunately. I also started vaping somewhere around 2 years ago.  

  I’m at a point where cigarettes don’t really do it for me. I still crave one after I eat or with my coffee, but other than that, I’m satisfied with just vaping.  

 Problem is, I want to quit. Maybe I don’t want hard enough but believe me, it is tough, considering the age I started smoking and the fact that my ADHD brain looooves nicotine and what it does for dopamine leveles.  

 I hate waking up and scrambling around to find my vape. I hate smoking 2 cigarettes and putting my hand on my vape next because it didn’t have enough ‘kick’. I see the dependency in me and the levels it reached and I want it to stop so badly. Last night I decided I’ll stop vaping at least. Of course, first thing after I woke up, I had the vape in my hands. 

 I’m at a point in my life where I can’t afford therapy to tackle this problem. Also, my life is pretty hectic right now, as I’m too underweight to start medication for now and I’ve also moved away for college and am on my own. I know the first week is the hardest, and I’m scared and lowkey feeling like I WANT to quit, but in reality I might not be able to.  

 Any advice from people in this community who understand smoking effects on the ADHD brain would be so so welcomed, as well as stories of your own. Thank you so much for reading",2,1728470380.0,TwoXADHD,5,1.0,False

I am about two weeks off zyn but the results I’ve noticed are tremendous. 

I have a garmin watch and my sleep scores have been through the roof the last week or so. My stress metrics and heart rate are also much better… (not shit Sherlock, you stopped filling your gums with stimulant lip pillows).

I work in an office setting and my anxiety and imposter syndrome is almost non-existent. I used to struggle and toss and turn in bed thinking about work or life problems and never could attribute that to the nicotine, but now I know.

If you’re debating quitting, you owe it to yourself — stop. I never knew what a little 3mg pouch was doing to me until I’m two weeks off. Those little suckers can give you short-term resolve, but for me, it really impacted my day-to-day even days after.

Caffeine as a substitute is its own Reddit post, but getting off nicotine has allowed me to truly embrace and appreciate a good cup of coffee (or two) throughout the day. 

Using this post as somewhat of a personal journal, but I hope it finds you well if you’re struggling with quitting. This community has been great — let’s keep supporting each other.",6,1728470121.0,QuittingZyn,1,1.0,False

Our hotel offers tours, which is what we were planning to do. While walking to dinner, an older gentleman stopped us on a motor bike and was advertising his tour for some waterfalls, coffee tour, etc. - something I’ve seen advertised on various guide sites. 

I asked for reviews, and only received screenshots no website link. 

He speaks English and French, and seemed very friendly. Part of me respects the hustler and the fact he’s friendly and approached us like this, kind of makes me want to give him business. 

Or is this a scam and I’m not seeing it?

I'm one of those people that makes a mountain out of a molehill, go round the block just to cross the street kinda guy aaaaand this endeavour of making a fabulous blog for you all hasn't flourished as well as I hoped. 

I do not want to give up, however; so here is a collection of all the live gigs and parties (that I could find) going from Thursday to Sunday. If you can't find this post, it's the first post on [BigBrisbane.au](https://www.bigbrisbane.au).

Currently studying Vis Arts at TAFE and no longer have the time to bring you ""The Big List"" so it will now be mostly live music and gigs. 

There is a mailchimp account to make a newsletter of all this stuff but it took 2 days to verify the domain and I got the same feeling you get when you put down a book and you know, deep in your heart, that it won't be picked back up again. 

In short, I need some help! If you're interested in doing a little volunteering and helping to bring 'The Big List' to Brisbanians all over, I'd love to hear from you. For one person, it takes about 16-20 hours to write. If others could take some sections and we could bring it all together - that would be most wonderful! 

If you'd like more information about me and about the guide, get in touch. 

As always, here's me [paypal](https://paypal.me/blueishbeaver?country.x=AU&locale.x=en_AU) if you'd like to donate to the cause (or you can 'buy me a coffee' on the blog - if you want.) 

It's Jazz month? Week? I'm not sure - but there is a whole bunch of Jazzy events for family or for the evening ;)

Get on it!

(6 to 8 shots per day / up to 50+ espresso per week),"i will normally lose 0.3 gram on my first grind after cleaning, weighing out 16 grams of beans and dose in basket will be consistent (+-0.1 grams max) after subsequent usage

As the E6Air's burrs take less than 10 secs to be dismantled as shown above, it's quite effortless. Assembly takes at most 30 secs as i would normally lube the metal catch.

my questions are; is it necessary to clean it weekly?recommended is 6 months??? i thought cleaning the grinder is to remove coffee oils, discard old coffee grounds and particles that get stuck to your equipment over time?

secondly, is it normal to find as much as 0.6 grams to 0.7 grams of old grounds each week (on any given grinders)?

But you know we grew up, seperated our ways. There are some Im still in contact with. But with lot of them I didnt meet them or text with them at least 1-2 years ago maximum 5-6 years ago. And in the last 2 weeks Im bumping into them and we started texting.. or we went out for coffee. Im bumping into exes.. my best friends exes. People I used to date.. I dream about old friends (who I didnt met in the last 2 week in person so I meet with them in my dreams) 
Its just weird like in 2 weeks I met like 10 of my old friends and they comeing back to my life.. and it feels like my past life and my life now is mergeing into one other and it feels weird. 
Did somebody have a life experience like this? Its like life shows me my past life mistakes problemes.. the good old times.. I cant explain it its just a weird feeling",1,1728469486.0,Life,0,1.0,False
