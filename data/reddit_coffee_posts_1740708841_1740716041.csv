In the early morning of a cold dewey fall day, I decided to take a walk. I had felt something off since the moment I woke up, but brushed it off as just another piece of an uncomfortable wakeup. I took my coat and stepped out the door, taking my usual walking route which took me around the town, passing the post office, coffee shop, the little bakery, and finally a path around the park.

However, this day wouldn‚Äôt take me any further on the path than the post office. Upon arriving there, I stopped dead in my tracks. Taped on the window, among the usual ads, schedules, wanted posters and convention flyers was a single missing person poster with my face on it. The face was exactly the same as the one on my driver‚Äôs license, and all the information was exactly my own. My height, weight, eye color, hair color, age and race were all there, but what wasn‚Äôt there was the most concerning part: my name. Instead of my name, it just said ‚ÄúJohn Doe.‚Äù Did that mean someone thought I was missing? How would they think I was missing but not know my name? There was no number to call at the bottom; it just said to call the police if found. This wasn‚Äôt a wanted poster either, so it wasn‚Äôt like I was a suspect in some kind of crime.

In need of answers, I entered the post office. I quickly changed my mind as every head in the building turned and looked at me. There were more people than usual, and they didn‚Äôt just glance at the door to see who came in; they stared directly into my eyes and dropped all conversation to look. I felt an uneasy sensation in my stomach, and I decided against asking about the poster. Instead, I just pretended to look at the stamps and left less than a minute later. When I left, half of the people there were still staring at me.

I took a different route to finish my walk, planning to just go home. On the way, though, I passed a little restaurant that wasn‚Äôt supposed to be open for hours‚Äî nobody had been there today‚Äî and yet, there was another poster in the window. I looked at the last seen date, and noticed it was today. How could the poster be up already? Whoever thought I was missing wouldn‚Äôt have thought it before this place was closed, so how did this poster be here!? I sighed and kept walking.

People were staring at me. As I walked, I could feel dozens of eyes place their gaze on me. Just like the post office, it seemed as if there were twice as many people walking around. I checked the time just to make sure I wasn‚Äôt mistaken, only to have my thoughts confirmed: it was 7:16 on a Tuesday with a street population reminiscent of a Saturday afternoon. I walked faster, taking a more direct route home. I didn‚Äôt know what was happening today, and I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable sticking around to find out.

By the time I got home, my fast walk had morphed into a light jog, leaving my coat drenched in sweat. I threw it to the ground and locked the door behind me. Having formed a plan on my walk home, I went to my computer and looked up my name. Nothing new; just my social media accounts, which were exactly as I had left them. I looked up ‚ÄúJohn Doe,‚Äù only to find the expected results‚Äî a musician, an IMDb page, Wikipedia, and government documents about assorted unidentified men, all unrelated to me. I sighed deeply and closed the tab. I questioned if this was just some kind of paranoid episode. My mind wasn‚Äôt always in the best place, so maybe it just came to a head today. I tried to move on with my day and start my work.

I worked at home for a minor programming studio, given a set list of things to do every day or week. I logged into my account, only to find my daily list empty. I checked the company notices page and found nothing new. Out of curiosity, I checked my employee profile. I hadn‚Äôt noticed anything when I logged in, but I rarely paid attention to the login process anyway. When I checked my profile, though, I found the entire thing blank. No profile picture, no employment status or job title, no assigned projects, no history, nothing.

I had no idea what was going on, and I was beginning to fear I never would. I remembered the poster again; remembered what was on it. I reluctantly followed its instructions and dialed 9-1-1. The voice on the other end asked me what my emergency was, and I replied, ‚ÄúHi, I saw a missing poster for a ‚ÄòJohn Doe,‚Äô and I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs me.‚Äù

The voice on the other end went silent.

My mental health has gone to shit and it's not getting any better. We used to be really good friends but he's so vile that I really hate living here and plan to move out ASAP. He went from being my best friend to the most vile, self-seeking person who takes advantage of me being nice. It sucks paying bills to live somewhere that doesn't feel like home and super uncomfortable.¬†



***Since living 2 years together, this is my experience with him:***

\-Gf comes over /sleeps here almost everyday 5-6 times a week. She forsure sleeps here more than at her house even tho it‚Äôs 15 minutes away¬†

\-Never gives me a heads up that‚Äôs she‚Äôs coming over and spend the night. I work from home and she‚Äôs always here by the time I‚Äôm done can‚Äôt even relax

\-This is the 2nd time he‚Äôs dones this the past two years living together even tho i told him i don‚Äôt feel comfortable living w a couple. And that i need my own space as well¬†

\-Hes not the cleanest person and ignores his messes but suddenly he only cleans when she‚Äôs coming over after she‚Äôs gone for a day or two. I wish he would have this same cleaning energy our couches clean. He lets his dog be on our couches w dirty paws and just walking on top of them all day. They‚Äôre not even white anymore and he puts blankets on them when she comes over¬†

\-3-4 times a week they order takeout and always¬† leave their mess and food trash on¬† the coffee and dining table. they don‚Äôt clean up after themselves and the uber bags will be there for days unless i throw it out the next morning¬†

\- During the weekdays they smoke weed all night, blasting the tv, and laughing obnoxiously loud all night even tho i have work the next day. They don‚Äôt care or consider that i have to wake up early for work like im the invisible roommate but they get mad when i put music during my morning showers¬†

\-I honestly dread the weekends cause they‚Äôll play house in the shared spaces all day/night playing house recently cooking too

\-The few times i have the living room to myself relaxing , they tend to join me in couch and end up taking over the living space. Even when i have a friend over they join us immediately in the couch. They cannot read the room that i just want to spend time w my friend.¬†



I understand wanting to see your partner everyday and spending time w them. But just bc you want to see her everyday doesn‚Äôt mean that¬† i have to see her everyday. I honestly don‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôre always here and never at her apartment. The ONLY time my roommate remembers that i live here is when something breaks and when the bills are due.¬†

Tomorrow Im going to give him a 30 day notice that i will be renting out my room to a random person bc i want to get the fuck out of here ASAP! I literally don‚Äôt see the point on paying half the bills anymore on a space that i can‚Äôt call home.¬†

Most likely he‚Äôs going to get upset on the random sublease but he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about me so why should i ?¬†

I‚Äôm not hateful or pity or nothing I‚Äôm happy for him and honestly been giving it my all on making this living situation work and being lenient on him being codependent on his his gf. But it‚Äôs clear that they both don‚Äôt care about respecting my boundaries and they never consider i live here too. I feel like the doormat that is expected to be okay w this living situation. Idk why he feels so entitled to do all of this in a SHARED apartments. I never know who‚Äôs here and A quick heads up will go a long way.¬†

I honeslty¬† don‚Äôt want to move out bc i love the location I‚Äôm in but mentally¬† can‚Äôt do this anymore. I‚Äôve become depressed and stressed living here. I tend to spend the day¬† in my bedroom bc i hate living at this apartment.¬† Which is sad and i recently noticed my hair is falling out due to it. I just want a peaceful living situation and be able to enjoy the space that i pay for. ¬†

Also before you guys suggest getting the Landlord involved i already tried and he doesn‚Äôt care bc we always pay on time.¬†

1izz3sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1izz3sq/i_survived_gods_test/,I survived God‚Äôs test,"I sat in the dim light of my apartment, staring blankly at the mess around me. Dishes piled high, clothes I hadn't bothered to pick up in weeks, and newspapers cluttered the floor like a layer of dust on my past. Everything about this place felt dead, as lifeless as I felt inside. It's been ten years since my parents died, but some days, it feels like it was just yesterday. Other days, like tonight, it feels like they've been gone forever. I stopped believing in anything after they passed. Faith, hope, God‚Äînone of it meant anything to me anymore.

But old habits die hard. I found myself sitting on the edge of my bed, hands clasped together like I used to when I was a kid, reciting half-remembered prayers. My words were hollow, slipping from my lips without meaning. I didn't believe anyone was listening. Why would they? I hadn't been to church in years and hadn't even thought about God in any real sense since I watched them lower my parents into the ground. But here I was, whispering prayers into the void, feeling stupid for even going through the motions.

The silence in the room felt suffocating. I let out a heavy sigh and ran my hands through my hair, pushing it back as I leaned forward, elbows resting on my knees. What was the point of all this? Every day felt like it bled into the next, an endless loop of nothingness. My friends had long since drifted away, and I couldn't blame them. I barely left the apartment anymore. Maybe they got tired of trying to pull me out of this pit when all I did was pull them in with me.

It was in the middle of that silence, that heavy, crushing stillness, that I heard it.

At first, I thought it was just my imagination‚Äîa voice, soft but clear, cutting through the haze in my mind. I sat up straighter, my heart pounding for reasons I couldn't explain.

""Jude,"" the voice said, smooth and comforting. ""Jude, I've been watching you.""

I froze, my mind racing. Was I hearing things? The voice was calm, almost soothing like it was speaking directly into my thoughts.

""Who...?"" I whispered, my voice cracking from disuse. My heart thudded against my ribs, the pulse-quickening as the voice continued.

""I am God,"" it said simply as if that explained everything. ""And I have chosen you.""

A cold shiver ran down my spine. God? That's ridiculous. I hadn't believed in God in a long time. But there was something about the way the voice spoke, something that made my skin prickle with fear and... a strange sense of comfort.

""You feel lost,"" it continued, as if reading my thoughts. ""You've drifted far from your path. But I am here now. I want to help you find your way again.""

I didn't respond. What could I say to that? My brain told me this was crazy, that I was losing my mind. But there was a part of me, the part that had been drowning in loneliness and despair, that wanted to believe it was real. I wanted to believe that someone‚Äîsomething‚Äîhad come to save me from myself.

I sat there for what felt like forever, staring into the darkened corners of my apartment, waiting for something else to happen. My heart was still racing, but my body felt frozen as if I couldn't move even if I wanted to. The voice‚Äîthat voice‚Äîkept echoing in my mind. ""I am God."" It was absurd, wasn't it? I wasn't some religious zealot or a man of faith anymore. But what else could it be? It wasn't like I'd had visitors recently, and it didn't sound like the kind of voice that came from a mind cracking under pressure. It was too...calm.

""I know you're afraid,"" the voice spoke again, softer this time, almost gentle. ""But there's nothing to fear. I've come to help you, Jude.""

I swallowed hard, feeling the dryness in my throat. ""Help me?"" My voice came out quieter than I intended. I didn't want to sound desperate, but I knew I did. I felt desperate.

""Yes,"" the voice replied, as steady and comforting as before. ""You've suffered long enough. I can see the weight you carry, the burden of your loss. Let me lift it for you. All I ask is to walk with you, to live through you, and to experience what it is to be human.""

Something about the way it said that last part made my skin crawl, but I brushed it off. I wasn't in the position to question help, no matter how strange it seemed. Living through me? Experiencing humanity? That didn't sound so bad, did it? The Catholic teachings from my childhood floated to the surface of my mind‚ÄîGod moving through us, guiding our actions, helping us be better. Maybe that's what this was.

I felt a flicker of something I hadn't felt in years. Hope. If this was real‚Äîif it wasn't some kind of delusion‚Äîmaybe this was my chance. My chance to make sense of everything that had happened, of everything I'd lost.

""What do you want from me?"" I asked, my voice a little stronger now.

""Only what you've already been willing to give,"" the voice said, patient. ""Your life, your experiences. I want to walk beside you, feel what you feel, and help you heal. In return, I will show you things you've never known. You'll find peace again.""

Peace. God, did I want that. The kind of peace that didn't feel like drowning in sorrow. The kind of peace that would let me sleep without waking up in the middle of the night, gasping for air with my heart pounding like I'd just been buried alive.

I hesitated for only a moment longer before nodding, though I wasn't sure who I was nodding to. ""Okay,"" I whispered. ""If you're really God, and you can do what you say... I'll let you in.""

The second the words left my mouth, I felt something‚Äîlike a cool breeze slipping inside my chest, filling the hollow space that had been there for so long. It wasn't unpleasant, but it was strange. Like I could feel the presence of something...someone else inside me.

""Thank you,"" the voice said, quieter now but still soothing. ""Together, we'll do great things.""

I exhaled, realizing I had been holding my breath. The apartment seemed quieter now, still dark and cluttered, but there was a lightness in the air that hadn't been there before. It was subtle, barely noticeable, but it was enough to make me feel...different.

I stood up, shaky at first but steadier than I'd been in weeks. Maybe months. There was a new energy coursing through me, something alive and warm. It made me feel like I could take on anything. Maybe this was what faith felt like. Maybe I was finally finding my way back to something greater than myself.

""Now,"" the voice spoke again, guiding me, ""let's begin.""

The days that followed were the brightest I'd had in years. The voice, soft and steady, kept me going, encouraging me to make small changes in my life. At first, it was simple things‚Äîcleaning up the apartment, tossing out the piles of trash I'd let build up for months. It was amazing how different it felt, how much lighter the air seemed once the place wasn't suffocating under the weight of clutter. The more I cleaned, the more I felt like I could breathe again.

I started taking better care of myself, too. The voice, always calm and reassuring, nudged me to shower more often, to eat real food instead of living off frozen meals and takeout. The act of making a sandwich felt oddly fulfilling as if I was reclaiming something I'd lost. For the first time in what felt like forever, I actually looked forward to the little things. It was as if the voice had flipped a switch inside me, lighting up the parts of me I'd buried in the darkness.

""You're doing well,"" the voice would say, that comforting tone wrapping around me like a warm blanket. ""This is the first step. You're on the right path.""

And I believed it. How could I not? My life was improving slowly but surely. I wasn't just sitting in that dingy apartment, staring at the walls anymore. I was living again. The voice kept me focused, kept me grounded, and I found myself trusting it more with each passing day.

But it wasn't just about cleaning and eating better. One morning, as I sipped on a cup of coffee I'd actually brewed myself instead of grabbing from the convenience store, the voice nudged me toward something bigger.

""It's time to reconnect,"" it said as if it knew exactly what was on my mind before I even thought it. ""Your friends have been waiting for you. They miss you, Jude.""

I stared at the cup in my hands, the steam swirling up in delicate patterns. My friends. I hadn't thought about them in a while, not really. Sure, I saw them maybe five times a year, but it was always awkward like we were strangers who shared old memories but nothing else. Over the years, I'd shut them out, unwilling to burden them with my misery. Yet, the voice was right. They were still there, waiting for me. Maybe now that I had ""God"" with me, things could be different.

""They're important to your journey,"" the voice continued. ""Reach out to them. Show them you're changing, that you're healing. They'll see it, and you'll help them too.""

There it was again‚Äîthat idea of helping others. The thought didn't just sit with me, it bloomed inside my chest like a seed sprouting new life. Maybe I could help them. Maybe this wasn't just about me anymore.

That afternoon, I sent out a few simple texts to the people I'd grown distant from.¬†*Hey, it's been a while. Want to catch up sometime?*

To my surprise, they responded. Enthusiastically. Within a few days, I was sitting at a small caf√©, sipping coffee with old friends I hadn't seen in months. At first, the conversation was light and casual‚Äîwhat everyone had been up to and how work was going. But as the hours wore on, we slipped into more personal territory.

It was Tom who brought it up first. He leaned back in his chair, eyes distant as he spoke about how he'd been struggling with anxiety, how it felt like the walls were closing in on him sometimes. I listened, nodding sympathetically, but I could feel the voice stirring in my mind.

""He needs to confront his pain,"" the voice whispered, soft but insistent. ""Push him. Make him face it head-on.""

I hesitated. Tom's words were heavy, filled with uncertainty, and it didn't feel right to dig into that. But the voice... it sounded so sure, so certain that this was the way. I shifted in my seat, trying to figure out how to approach it.

""You know,"" I began carefully, ""sometimes you have to face that stuff directly. I've been going through some things myself, and what's helped me is... confronting it. Really digging deep, even when it hurts.""

Tom blinked at me, surprised. His expression shifted‚Äîwas that discomfort?‚Äîbut I pressed on, the voice urging me forward.

""Maybe you need to look at what's really causing it,"" I continued. ""Stop avoiding it. Let it hurt for a while, and then you'll come out stronger.""

He didn't respond at first, just stared into his cup. The silence felt heavy between us like the air itself had thickened. My heart started to race‚Äîhad I gone too far? Had I pushed too hard? But the voice was calm, unbothered.

""You're helping him,"" it said, soothing me. ""This is what he needs.""

Tom finally looked up, his eyes dark and stormy. ""Maybe,"" he said quietly, but there was a tension in his voice, something fragile that I couldn't quite place.

The rest of the conversation was more stilted after that. We talked a little longer, but the warmth from earlier was gone. I left the caf√© feeling uneasy as if something had shifted, but I couldn't pinpoint what it was. Still, the voice reassured me, telling me that this was how people grew‚Äîthrough pain, through confrontation. I convinced myself that I was helping Tom, even if it didn't feel that way at the moment.

That night, as I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, the familiar pain in my back returned. This time, it was sharper and more intense than it had been before. I groaned, shifting uncomfortably as the ache spread from my shoulders down my spine.

""Relax,"" the voice said, gentle but firm. ""This is part of the process. It's how you grow.""

I clenched my teeth as the pain intensified, a burning sensation now radiating from my shoulder blades. It felt like something was pressing against my skin from the inside, trying to break free. But even as the discomfort grew, I found myself accepting it, welcoming it. The voice was right‚Äîpain was necessary. It was how we became stronger, how we grew.

As the night wore on, the pain dulled into a throbbing ache, but I didn't fight it. I let it consume me, drifting into a restless sleep with the voice whispering softly in the back of my mind.

""This is only the beginning.""

The next few days passed in a blur. My back still ached, but I pushed it to the back of my mind, focusing on the progress I was making. Things were... good. Or at least, they seemed that way. I was reaching out to friends more, keeping the apartment clean, and eating better. The voice kept guiding me, offering bits of advice that I followed without question.

But Tom had been quiet since our last meeting. At first, I chalked it up to him needing time to process what I'd said, but after days of radio silence, a small seed of doubt began to grow in my mind. Had I gone too far? Had I pushed him when he wasn't ready?

""You did the right thing,"" the voice reassured me. ""He needs time, that's all. Growth comes through pain, Jude. You'll see.""

I wanted to believe it. I needed to believe it. After all, the voice hadn't steered me wrong yet. My life was better because of it. So, I pushed my doubts aside and focused on the next step in my journey‚Äîreaching out to Mark, another old friend I hadn't seen in months.

We arranged to meet at a local bar, the kind of place we used to frequent back in the day before everything had fallen apart. When I walked in, Mark was already there, sitting at a corner table with a beer in hand. He smiled when he saw me, but there was something in his eyes‚Äîa flicker of hesitation, maybe. Or was it just my imagination?

""Jude,"" he said, standing up to greet me. ""It's been a while.""

""Yeah,"" I replied, forcing a smile as I shook his hand. ""Too long.""

We made small talk for a while, catching up on the usual things‚Äîwork, life, the weather. But the voice was there, in the back of my mind, waiting. It felt like it was biding its time, waiting for the right moment to step in.

And that moment came after Mark's second beer, when he leaned in a little closer, his voice lowering as he talked about his recent breakup.

""It's been rough,"" he admitted, his eyes downcast. ""I thought she was the one, you know? But... things fell apart. It's my fault, mostly. I guess I've just got too much baggage. She couldn't deal with it anymore.""

The voice stirred, its presence stronger now. ""He needs to face the truth, Jude,"" it whispered, insistent. ""He's hiding from himself. Make him confront it.""

I hesitated again, just like I had with Tom. But the voice's pressure was stronger this time, more urgent. It pushed me, and before I could stop myself, the words were spilling out.

""You know, maybe she left because you weren't dealing with your own problems,"" I said, my tone sharper than I'd intended. ""Maybe she saw the cracks and realized you were never going to fix them.""

Mark blinked, his expression shifting from sadness to confusion. ""What?""

""You've got to face it, Mark,"" I continued, the voice pushing me forward. ""You can't just blame it on her leaving. If you want to move on, you've got to face your own shit. Stop hiding behind the breakup like it's all on her. You're the problem, and until you deal with that, no one's ever going to stick around.""

There was a long silence after that. Mark stared at me, his face tightening, a mix of shock and anger flashing across his features. I could feel my heart racing and the blood pounding in my ears. Had I gone too far again? Had I pushed him like I had with Tom? But the voice kept whispering, reassuring me.

""This is for his own good, Jude. You're helping him grow. Pain leads to understanding.""

""I‚ÄîI didn't mean it like that,"" Mark stammered, his voice shaky. ""I... I don't know. Maybe you're right, but...""

His words trailed off, and he looked away, his jaw clenched. I knew I'd hit a nerve, but instead of feeling guilty, I felt something else‚Äîa sense of satisfaction. The voice was right. This was how people grew. By facing their pain head-on.

The rest of the night was awkward. We didn't talk much after that; we just exchanged a few strained words before Mark made an excuse to leave early. I watched him walk out of the bar, the weight of the moment pressing down on me, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I had done the right thing.

I sat there alone for a while, sipping my beer and replaying the conversation in my head. The more I thought about it, the more I convinced myself that I had helped him, just like I'd helped Tom. It didn't matter that they both seemed uncomfortable, even hurt by my words. Growth was painful. That's what the voice kept telling me, and I believed it.

As I walked home that night, the pain in my back flared up again, sharper this time. I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, wincing as the burning sensation spread across my shoulders. It felt like something was moving beneath my skin, pushing against it, trying to break free. I stumbled, clutching at my back as the pain intensified, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps.

""Breathe, Jude,"" the voice whispered, calm and patient. ""This is part of your transformation. You're becoming something more. Embrace the pain.""

I stood there, hunched over in the cold night air, gritting my teeth as the agony ripped through me. But I didn't fight it. I couldn't. If this was what it took to fulfill my purpose, to help others grow, then I would endure it. I would let the pain shape me, just like the voice had promised.

After what felt like an eternity, the pain dulled, leaving a throbbing ache in its wake. I straightened up slowly, my body trembling, and continued walking home. By the time I reached my apartment, I was drenched in sweat, my legs barely able to carry me to my bed.

As I lay there, staring at the ceiling, the voice hummed softly in my mind, soothing me, calming me.

""You're on the right path,"" it said. ""Soon, you'll understand everything. This is just the beginning.""

I closed my eyes, my body still aching, but I felt something else now‚Äîsomething deeper. A sense of purpose. Of destiny.

Whatever was happening to me, I was ready for it.

I texted Mark again, asking if he wanted to meet up. The first few texts went unanswered, but I kept pushing. After what happened last time, I understood why he might not be too eager to see me. I told him I wanted to apologize and that I just wanted to talk things through and make things right. After a long wait, he finally agreed.

We planned to meet at my apartment this time. Something about the isolation of it felt right. The voice told me it was better this way‚Äîno distractions, no interruptions. We could really get into what was holding him back, and I could help him grow.

The day came, and Mark showed up looking uneasy, fidgeting with his jacket zipper as he stood in my doorway. I tried to smile, to put him at ease, but there was a nervous energy between us that made my skin prickle. Still, I invited him in, and he hesitantly stepped over the threshold.

The apartment was clean now, almost unrecognizable compared to the mess it had been before. Mark glanced around, visibly surprised at the change. ""You've been busy,"" he commented, his voice strained with forced casualness.

""Yeah, I've been making some changes,"" I said, keeping my tone light. ""Trying to improve, you know? Just like I want to help you do.""

Mark's eyes flickered with something‚Äîworry, maybe‚Äîbut he nodded and sat down on the couch. I could see how tense he was, the way his shoulders were hunched forward as if he was bracing himself for something.

We made small talk for a bit, just like we did at the bar last time, but I wasn't interested in the surface-level stuff anymore. The voice was there, whispering in the back of my mind, urging me forward. It was time to help Mark break through his walls.

""You've been struggling,"" I said, cutting off the light conversation. ""Since the breakup. I know you're trying to move on, but you haven't really faced the real problem, have you?""

Mark stiffened. His eyes darkened, his lips pressing together into a thin line. ""I... I don't want to get into all that again, Jude,"" he muttered. ""Not like last time.""

But the voice pushed harder, louder now, drowning out any second thoughts I might've had. ""He needs to feel it, Jude. He needs to suffer if he's ever going to grow.""

I leaned forward, my hands clasped together as I stared at him, my gaze unwavering. ""You're never going to get past this if you keep running from it,"" I said, my voice firm. ""You need to face the pain, Mark. You need to feel it, deep down, or you'll never heal.""

Mark shifted uncomfortably, his eyes darting toward the door. ""I... I don't think this is a good idea.""

Before he could move, before he could stand up to leave, the voice gave a final command. ""Show him. Make him feel it.""

My hand shot out and grabbed his arm, gripping it tightly. Mark froze, his eyes widening in shock. ""Jude, what are you doing?""

""You need to feel it,"" I repeated, my voice steady but my grip tightening. ""This is the only way. You can't keep running from the pain.""

I twisted his arm behind his back, forcing him to his knees as he yelped in pain. My heart raced, but the voice was there, soothing me, telling me this was right. This was how I was supposed to help him.

""Jude, stop!"" Mark gasped, struggling against me, but I held him firm, pushing him down harder. His body twisted under the pressure, his breath coming in ragged gasps as I forced him to the ground.

The voice was relentless now, filling my mind with its commands. ""Make him suffer. Only then will he understand.""

My free hand reached for his throat, pressing down as his eyes filled with terror. His hands clawed at my wrists, trying to pry me off, but I didn't let go. I pressed harder, feeling his pulse quicken beneath my fingers.

""This is for your own good,"" I whispered, my voice trembling with some twisted form of reassurance. ""You'll thank me for this.""

Mark's face twisted in agony, his body writhing as he struggled to breathe. His gasps turned into choked sobs, and I felt something inside me shift, something dark and violent taking root. The voice hummed in satisfaction, feeding on the pain I was inflicting.

And then, suddenly, it wasn't just Mark who was suffering. A sharp, searing pain erupted in my back, so intense that I staggered, releasing him. My hands flew to my shoulders as the pain spread, tearing through me like a wildfire. I collapsed to my knees, gasping as the burning sensation reached its peak.

Mark scrambled away, coughing and choking as he stumbled to his feet. I barely noticed him flee, my mind consumed by the agony ripping through my body. I could feel something moving beneath my skin, pushing, stretching, breaking free.

The pain became unbearable, and I screamed, my voice raw and animalistic. My shoulders were on fire, my flesh tearing as something sharp began to poke through the skin. Blood soaked through my shirt, and I ripped it off, desperate to see what was happening.

My back was a mess of torn skin and blood, but beneath the gore, I saw them‚Äîtwo jagged, bony spikes protruding from my shoulder blades. They were growing, pushing their way out of me with sickening cracks and pops, stretching upward like twisted, blood-soaked wings.

The pain was unimaginable, but through it all, I felt... elated. The voice was there, soothing me, telling me that this was my transformation, my reward for doing ""God's"" work.

""You're becoming something more,"" it whispered. ""This is your destiny. Embrace it.""

I collapsed onto the floor, my body trembling, blood pooling beneath me. My vision blurred, the edges of the room darkening as I fought to stay conscious. But even as the darkness closed in, I couldn't help but smile.

I had done it. I had helped Mark, just like I was meant to. And now, I was becoming something greater‚Äîsomething divine.

As I slipped into unconsciousness, the last thing I heard was the voice, calm and reassuring.

""You've done well, Jude. You're almost ready.""

The voice had grown louder and more demanding over the past few days. It wasn't satisfied with the small acts of pain I'd inflicted. I'd pushed Mark and Tom, I'd made them suffer, but it wasn't enough. The voice told me they were only steps on a path, a necessary part of my transformation, but there was more‚Äîsomething bigger, something I wasn't yet ready to see.

That night, the voice called to me with a new urgency.

""Now is the time, Jude,"" it whispered, its tone colder than before. ""You've prepared yourself for this moment. You must bring suffering to the world. Only then will you truly become what I need you to be.""

I didn't question it. How could I? Everything the voice had told me up to this point had been right. I had seen the changes in myself, the transformation happening before my eyes‚Äîbefore my¬†*soul*. The spikes in my back were proof that I was becoming something more than human. The pain, the agony I endured, it was all part of the process.

But this time, the voice wasn't asking for words or emotional suffering. This time, it wanted something real. Something irreversible.

""Go out tonight,"" it commanded. ""Find someone. A soul that needs to feel my presence. Bring them pain, Jude. Bring them to me.""

I didn't ask why. I didn't hesitate. I simply did as I was told.

I left my apartment without a second thought, the cool night air hitting my skin as I stepped into the darkness. The city was quieter than usual. Empty streets stretched before me, illuminated by pale streetlights casting long shadows on the pavement. I felt a strange sense of calm as I walked as if I knew exactly what I needed to do.

The voice guided me, tugging at my mind, pulling me toward the quiet alleys and backstreets. I walked for what felt like hours, my body moving on autopilot until I saw her. She was standing by herself, waiting at a bus stop. A middle-aged woman dressed in a dark coat looking down at her phone. She was alone. Vulnerable.

""This is her, Jude,"" the voice said, its presence now overpowering. ""She's the one. Her soul is ready. You must help her. Bring her pain, bring her closer to me.""

I felt my heart racing, not with fear, but with anticipation. My hands twitched as I approached her, my footsteps barely making a sound on the cracked sidewalk. She didn't notice me until I was right behind her.

""Excuse me?"" I said, my voice steady, almost friendly.

She turned around, startled. I could see the confusion on her face as she took a step back, her eyes flicking to the empty street around us. ""Can I help you?"" she asked, her voice shaking slightly.

""You need to feel this,"" I whispered, taking a step closer.

Her face contorted with fear, and she tried to back away, but I was faster. My hands reached out and grabbed her throat, squeezing tight before she could even scream. The shock in her eyes quickly turned to panic as she clawed at my arms, struggling to pull free.

""Shh,"" I whispered, tightening my grip. ""This is for you. You need to feel the pain. It's the only way to get closer to Him.""

Her gasps filled the air, her body thrashing as she tried to fight me off, but I held her down, pressing her into the ground, the cold pavement beneath us. My grip tightened even more, my fingers digging into her skin as her struggles became weaker, her eyes wide with terror. I felt no remorse, no guilt. This was the right thing to do. She needed this. I was giving her a gift.

Her body stopped moving after a while, the last breath escaping her lips in a faint, broken sound. I held on for a moment longer, waiting until the life drained from her eyes. When I finally let go, her body fell limp against the pavement.

I stood there, breathing heavily, my hands trembling as I looked down at her lifeless form. A strange sense of satisfaction washed over me. The voice had been right. This was necessary. I had done what was asked of me, and now... now I would finally receive my reward.

And then, the pain hit.

It was unlike anything I had ever felt before. A burning, searing agony exploded in my back, sharper than the spikes that had emerged before. I screamed, my body convulsing as I fell to my knees beside her corpse. My hands clawed at my back, but there was nothing I could do to stop it. The pain grew worse, spreading from my shoulders down to my spine as if my entire body was being torn apart from the inside.

And then I felt them‚Äîsomething large, heavy, and wet pushing through the torn skin of my back. The spikes, the ones that had been there for days, began to stretch and grow, tearing through the flesh with a sickening crack. Blood poured from the wounds, staining the pavement beneath me as the spikes unfurled.

I gasped, my breath catching in my throat as I felt them grow‚Äîlong, jagged, blood-soaked wings erupting from my back. They spread wide, casting dark shadows in the dim light of the streetlamp, each movement sending waves of pain through my body. I could feel the blood dripping down my sides, pooling beneath me as the wings twitched and flexed, heavy and sharp.

But through all the pain, I felt... alive. I looked up at the sky, my body trembling as I knelt in the pool of blood, her lifeless body beside me. The wings beat once, twice, heavy and strong, sending gusts of air around me.

""You've done it,"" the voice said, soft but triumphant. ""You've brought her to me. You've embraced your destiny, Jude. This is what you were meant to become.""

The pain was unbearable, but it didn't matter. I had become something more‚Äîsomething divine. I had fulfilled my purpose. The wings, though grotesque and soaked in blood, felt like the final piece of my transformation.

I had killed for God. And in return, He had given me this.

As I knelt there, the blood still seeping from my wounds, I felt a strange peace settle over me. This was what I was meant to do. This was who I was meant to be.

I woke up in the hospital, strapped to machines, barely able to move. At first, I thought it was a dream‚Äîone of those nightmares where you can't scream, can't even open your eyes. But it wasn't a dream. This was real. I couldn't move, couldn't feel anything from the neck down.

They told me I had been found in the middle of the street, covered in blood, barely alive. The police thought I was the victim of some random attack. They said it was a miracle I'd survived at all. The woman‚Äî*the woman I killed*‚Äîthey said she hadn't been so lucky. They told me they'd found her body next to mine, beaten, strangled. But they never suspected me. Not once. They said someone must've attacked us both, that I'd somehow made it out alive while she didn't.

It's strange. You'd think I'd feel relieved that I wasn't caught. But all I could feel was‚Ä¶ devastation.

I had failed Him.

The wings‚Äî*my wings*‚Äîwere gone. When I came to that hospital bed, paralyzed and broken, there was nothing left. No evidence of the transformation I had undergone. No proof of the divine being I was becoming. I had blacked out after my wings emerged, and now they were gone as if they had never been there at all.

And that‚Ä¶ that is what haunts me the most.

I didn't get to finish the work. I didn't get to bring the world closer to Him, to help them understand the beauty of suffering, the purity of pain. When I lost consciousness, I must have disappointed Him. I failed God at the moment when He needed me most.

Now I lie here, in this bed, day after day. Paralyzed. Bedridden. Useless. They gave me this device to help me communicate and to speak my thoughts aloud so I could share my story. But what good is it now? What good am I now?

Still‚Ä¶ even in this broken body, I feel something. A kind of peace. Yes, I failed Him in the end, but I was chosen.¬†*I was chosen*¬†to let Him experience life through me. And for that, I am grateful.

Every moment of pain, every act of suffering I brought into this world‚Ä¶ it wasn't for nothing. I allowed God to live through me, to feel what it means to be human. That was His wish, and I gave it to Him. Even if I couldn't see it through to the end, I did what He asked of me. I let Him feel.

I lie here now, knowing I won't ever walk again. I won't ever leave this bed. But I still feel blessed. I was His vessel. I carried out His will, even if I didn't finish it.

No one knows what really happened that night. They think I'm a survivor, some poor soul who barely escaped with his life. But that's not true. I wasn't the victim. I was¬†*chosen*. I was His instrument. And I will never forget that.

I close my eyes, and sometimes I can still feel the wings, the weight of them, the blood dripping from the tips. In those moments, I smile. I may have disappointed Him, but I let Him live through me. I gave Him what He wanted. And that's enough.",1,1740715609.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Breakfast - Skip, get a little microfast to start the day, I do usually have coffee with almond milk, no sugar, I could cut the coffee out if that would be better

  
Lunch - A whole thing(4 servings) of Sugar Free Almond Milk Yogurt with 2 scoops of organic peanut butter powder, just peanuts, sugar free, mixed in, a very large amount of blackberries, raspberries and blueberries mixed in and a very large amount of slivered almonds mixed in, this makes it very filling, and holds me over till dinner. There is no added sugar to this.

  
Dinner - .71 - 1 Pound of Sirloin Steak cooked with salt, pepper, italian seasoning, butter and olive oil and usually a whole Egg Plant

1izywms,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1izywms/the_day_i_found_out_my_best_friend_was_hiding_a/,The Day I Found Out My Best Friend Was Hiding a Big Secret,"This is one of those stories I never expected to tell, but looking back, I can‚Äôt shake how strange everything turned out. It started a few months ago when my best friend, Alex, invited me to hang out for the weekend. We‚Äôve known each other since high school, so we‚Äôve been through just about everything together. We‚Äôre the kind of friends who tell each other everything‚Äîat least, I thought we did.

That Saturday, we were hanging out at his place, just chilling like usual. We were playing video games, grabbing snacks, and catching up on life. At some point, I went to the bathroom, and when I came back, I noticed something odd on the coffee table‚Äîan envelope that didn‚Äôt belong there. It was just sitting there, kind of out of place. The thing that caught my eye wasn‚Äôt the envelope itself, but the name written on it.

It was my name. My full name, first and last.

I don‚Äôt know why, but something about it felt off. I tried to brush it off, but my curiosity got the better of me. I picked it up and, without thinking, opened it.

Inside was a letter, written in a handwriting that wasn‚Äôt Alex‚Äôs. At first, I thought it was a mistake, maybe something he‚Äôd accidentally received. But when I read the letter, it hit me. It was a formal document, and the more I read, the more it became clear. Alex had been hiding something from me‚Äîsomething huge.

The letter was from a lawyer, and it was about a legal matter Alex hadn‚Äôt mentioned at all. I won‚Äôt go into too many details, but it had to do with some family issues he had been dealing with behind the scenes. The letter mentioned a trust fund, a large sum of money, and the fact that Alex was the sole beneficiary of a sizable inheritance.

I was in complete shock. I had no idea any of this was going on. We‚Äôve been close for years, and not once had he ever mentioned this. I mean, we talk about everything‚Äîat least, I thought we did.

I tried to act normal when I went back into the living room, but I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about what I had just read. After a while, I just had to ask him about it. I said, ‚ÄúHey, I found something. What‚Äôs going on with this letter?‚Äù

He froze. It was like I‚Äôd caught him completely off guard. I could see the guilt in his eyes. He hesitated, then sighed deeply and sat down next to me. That‚Äôs when he told me everything.

Apparently, his family had been dealing with some complex legal and financial issues for years, and he didn‚Äôt want to bring it up because he knew it would worry me. He didn‚Äôt want anyone treating him differently because of the money, and he was trying to figure out how to handle it all on his own. He‚Äôd been keeping it a secret because he didn‚Äôt want to deal with the extra attention and didn‚Äôt want me to think he was only interested in hanging out for the wrong reasons.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it. We had been through so much together, and I had no idea he was carrying around this massive weight. I felt bad for not noticing, but at the same time, I couldn‚Äôt help but admire how he‚Äôd managed to keep it together.

The whole thing changed the way I saw him. It wasn‚Äôt about the money or the inheritance‚Äîit was about the trust he had in me and how much he was trying to protect me from his personal problems. That weekend, we had a long talk, and I assured him that I didn‚Äôt care about any of that stuff. I just wanted to be there for him, no matter what.

It was a weird feeling, though. The person you think you know the best is hiding something this big from you. But it also made me realize that we all have our secrets, and sometimes, people keep them not because they want to, but because they‚Äôre trying to protect the ones they care about.",2,1740714950.0,stories,2,0.75,False

The nearly four years leading up to it were perhaps toxic.  Unrealistic and unrealized expectations on your end.  For myself, an illusion that things were okay, but in hindsight the foundation we built our ""friendship"" on was cracked from the start.

I remember when I first met you.  I was several months removed from graduating college.  Needed a job with the holidays approaching, and I came home to a non-existent social life.  The few friends from high school, except for one, went their own separate ways after leaving town.  One I had a falling out with. I was lonely.  When I first saw you wearing a wrestling shirt, being a fan myself, I had to say hello.  When I learned you were into some of the music, it only made you cooler.

We quickly developed a friendship.  Coffee after work, hanging out, but I was getting a vibe.  Several months later you told me you wanted more than friendship.  I couldn't offer you the same.  At that point we should've just called it, but we somehow carried on.  More hanging out, bowling nights, driving around listening to Dream Theater.  In hindsight we were two lonely people sharing a desire for connection, but for each of us the connection we sought was opposite of each other.

In my ignorance I invited you to be a +1 to a college friend's wedding out-of-state.  A weekend of sharing a hotel room.  Nothing happened.  That should've been the hard slam to your hopes, but it wasn't.

A little more than a year later the shoddy house crumbled down over a phone call.  I had to ask again, and once again you said you wanted more.  I told you I don't feel that way about you.  I never felt that way, but I was grateful for our friendship.  You yelled at me saying I wasted 3 years of your life.  In hindsight, perhaps I did, but you had every opportunity to seek someone who would want you as a romantic partner.  Heck, I often encouraged you when you said you met a guy.  When I think it over, a part of me wonders if you were only saying that to get me jealous.  It didn't work.  

A year after the fateful call in a small world twist, our paths crossed again.  Foolishly I let you back in, but our friendship eventually ended in a whimper as I didn't return a call.  We never followed up with each other, and I feel that was for the best.  

Over the years I think of how our whatever it can be called affected my life, for the better.  You encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone.  You helped push me to socialize when I'd rather shut the world out.  You helped me learn.  I've had similar situations with other women prior to you, but I learned from the fallout of our misunderstandings and ignorance, that perhaps it really is true that members of the opposite sex can't just be friends.  

I was in a far different headspace twenty-five years ago when we first met, and throughout the several years of our dysfunction than where I am now, yet I apologize.  I apologize I couldn't be what you wanted me to be, but more importantly, I apologize for not being honest enough, man enough, to let you go.   If you felt I strung you along, I never meant to.  All I wanted was a cool friend.",3,1740714900.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

walking down a dark, foggy street at night
mood is chill, just heading home after a long day
suddenly, see a figure standing in the distance
it‚Äôs Michael Myers, just casually lurking in the shadows
he‚Äôs holding a knife like he‚Äôs about to do something horrible
I stop dead in my tracks, but then‚Äîwait, what‚Äôs that?
suddenly, another figure appears
it‚Äôs Don Rickles
he‚Äôs just strolling down the street like he owns the place, wearing his usual snarky grin
Rickles looks up and sees Michael
Rickles doesn‚Äôt skip a beat
‚ÄúHEY, YOU! WHAT IS THIS, A COSTUME PARTY? YOU GO TO PARTY CITY, PICKED UP A MASK, AND DECIDED TO BE A DEAD BODY FOR A LIVING?‚Äù
Michael Myers, silent and ominous, lifts his knife and takes a step forward

Michael starts to advance, but Rickles doesn‚Äôt even flinch
‚ÄúOH, HERE WE GO, PAL. YOU THINK YOU‚ÄôRE SOME BIG SHOT KILLER? YOU‚ÄôRE NOT EVEN A GOOD STUNT DOUBLE IN A B-MOVIE,‚Äù Rickles says, pacing around him
Michael Myers, visibly confused, lunges forward
Rickles ducks and slaps him in the back of the head
‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE SO SLOW, YOU COULDN‚ÄôT CATCH A SNAIL IF IT WAS SPRINTING!‚Äù
Rickles gets right up in his face, ‚ÄúYOU WANNA KILL ME? YOU CAN‚ÄôT EVEN WIN A FIGHT WITH A GARDEN GNOME, YOU STIFF-NECKED LOBOTOMY CASE!‚Äù
Michael‚Äôs mask doesn‚Äôt change expression, but his movements get more frantic, like he‚Äôs realizing he‚Äôs met the wrong guy
Rickles, still taunting, ‚ÄúYOU LOOK LIKE YOU‚ÄôRE JUST ABOUT TO FLIP OUT OVER A SPILLED DRINK AT A WEDDING‚ÄîBUT WHAT DO YOU DO? STARE AT THE COFFEE TABLE WITH A KNIFE LIKE YOU‚ÄôRE GOING TO MAKE IT WORK?‚Äù
at this point, Michael‚Äôs movements are completely erratic, he starts thrashing around, his arms flying wildly in every direction
Rickles keeps roasting, ‚ÄúLOOK AT YOU, YOU‚ÄôRE A HITMAN WHO CAN‚ÄôT HIT A HAMBURGER IN A DRIVE-THRU! AND WHAT, YOU THINK YOU‚ÄôRE SCARY? YOU‚ÄôRE ABOUT AS MENACING AS A MANNEQUIN IN A MALL WINDOW.‚Äù
Michael, completely losing his composure, starts to swing his knife wildly

from behind, Dr. Loomis‚ÄîMichael‚Äôs lifelong nemesis‚Äîruns up, looking completely out of breath
he sees Michael lying dead on the ground
Loomis just stares at the scene in pure confusion
‚ÄúWHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!‚Äù
Rickles looks at him, ‚ÄúOH, LOOK, IT‚ÄôS THE GUY WHO‚ÄôS BEEN CHASING HIM AROUND FOR 40 YEARS, AND HE FINALLY CATCHES A BREAK. DID YOU EXPECT A GOOD ENDING OR SOMETHING, PAL?‚Äù
Loomis stumbles backward, looking more confused than a kid in a calculus class
he shakes his head, his brain is frying from the absurdity of the situation
‚ÄúI‚ÄîI don‚Äôt‚ÄîHOW?‚Äù
Rickles, grinning ear to ear, shrugs
‚ÄúI‚ÄôM A COMEDIAN, DOC. I ROAST PEOPLE. AND THIS GUY? HIS ACT WAS OVER LONG AGO.‚Äù
Loomis‚Äôs confusion deepens, and the longer he stands there, the more his brain seems to overheat
he looks at Michael‚Äôs lifeless body, then back at Rickles
Rickles adds, ‚ÄúLOOK, PAL, IF YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS, GET A CLUE. GUYS LIKE HIM? THEY DON‚ÄôT LAST LONG AGAINST CHARISMA.‚Äù
Loomis can‚Äôt handle it, his mind snaps, and he starts coughing violently
like something inside him just broke
Rickles laughs, ‚ÄúWHAT, DID YOU THINK I‚ÄôD DIE AT THE HANDS OF A MENTAL CASE LIKE HIM? YOU‚ÄôRE ABOUT AS LOST AS A GUY TRYING TO FIND THE EXIT AT A RODNEY DANGERFIELD ROAST!‚Äù
Loomis, now sweating, staggers backward and collapses to the ground
Rickles looks down at him with a grin
‚ÄúHE‚ÄôS GONE NOW, TOO. LOOKS LIKE THE ONLY ONE STILL STANDING IS ME. CAN YOU FEEL THE POWER?‚Äù

Somehow I used the law during my life but it was for some little things and non-material (except coffee). Since last year, after I‚Äôve watched a Secret, I‚Äôm really into it and I was watching tons of videos and reading a lot about the law. At first I thought  don‚Äôt get things cause of my mood and negative energy, but then I discovered that there are too laws and the difference is that you don‚Äôt have to be in high vibrations to get your desires because the law of assumption works differently from the law of attraction. 
I struggle with my SP. We only met once and I thought that the only way to be in relationship with him is the law. So, I work on my life, being busy with it (but don‚Äôt like my job, income and state at all), but I don‚Äôt know anything about him. I mean, I could get some news, and there might me a third party involved but I don‚Äôt care. So, I don‚Äôt have problems with checking his life or worrying about 3p or something else. 
Another my struggles are my appearance (my weight), money and job (but fine, I could wait for it). 
Long story short, I don‚Äôt understand what I am doing wrong. I would be happy to increase my income, I want to manifest money to buy my parents a tour, even without success with SP.

For example, I would be happy to manifest money at first to make myself more confident with what I‚Äôm doing. 

PS Forgot to mention that right after I started to manifest my SP (October, when we met), there were three days in a row when I met people who I don‚Äôt know personally but we‚Äôve met at the same place where I saw my SP. Which was really random because our city is huge and chances was sooo low. So I thought I was doing everything right and these were good signs.

When the machine is in operation, hot water is forced‚Å¢ through‚Å£ the coffee grounds ‚Å§at ‚Å§high pressure. The felt washer ensures that this pressure is directed correctly, maximizing extraction and preventing water from escaping where it shouldn't.

A worn or damaged ‚ÄåBreville .bes870xl/06.29 felt washer can lead to several problems, including:

* **Leaks:** ‚ÄçThe‚Å¢ most‚Å§ obvious sign of a failing felt washer is water leaking around the group head during brewing.
* **Reduced Pressure:** If ‚Äçthe‚Å£ seal is compromised, the‚Å£ machine may struggle ‚Å£to reach and maintain the necessary pressure for optimal espresso extraction. This can result ‚Å§in weak or under-extracted shots.
* **inconsistent Brewing:** Fluctuations in pressure ‚Äçand temperature can lead to inconsistent espresso quality, making it challenging to dial in your shots.
* **Increased Wear and Tear:** Leaks can eventually lead to corrosion and ‚Å¢damage to other components within the machine,‚Å£ potentially requiring more extensive and costly repairs.

Knowing the role of this small component highlights why regular inspection and‚Äã timely replacement are‚Å¢ crucial for the longevity and‚Å£ optimal performance of your‚Äã Breville BES870XL.[[Explore Top Rated breville .bes870xl/06.29 felt washer on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/breville/?kw=breville.bes870xl/06.29 felt washer)
## Identifying the ‚ÄãNeed for a Breville BES870XL felt Washer Replacement

Recognizing the ‚Äåsymptoms of a worn felt washer ‚Äçis the first step towards maintaining your Breville espresso machine.Here‚Äå are ‚Å§some key indicators that it's time ‚Å¢for a replacement:

* **Visible Leaks:** As mentioned earlier, this is ‚Äåthe most obvious sign. Look for‚Äã water dripping or spraying from around the group head when brewing. Pay ‚Äåclose attention to‚Å£ the area where‚Äã the portafilter locks into the machine.* **Drop in Pressure:** If‚Äç you notice that your espresso‚Äç shots are consistently weaker‚Äå or thinner than usual, even after adjusting your grind size and tamping pressure, a‚Äå faulty felt washer could be the culprit. Check the pressure gauge‚Äå during brewing; a significant drop could indicate ‚Å¢a leak.
* **Unusual noises:** A hissing or sputtering sound coming from the group head during brewing can ‚Å§also‚Äå suggest a‚Å¢ problem with the seal. This noise is often caused by water escaping through a compromised felt washer.
* **Difficulty Locking the Portafilter:** In some cases, a worn felt washer can cause the portafilter to become more difficult to lock ‚Äçinto place.‚Å¢ This is as the washer is no longer providing the necessary support and sealing.
* **extended Brewing Time:** A leak can reduce the overall pressure, leading ‚Å¢to slower extraction times. If‚Å§ your shots are taking substantially longer to pull than normal, investigate the felt washer.

Regularly ‚Å¢observing your machine ‚Äçduring operation and being attentive to ‚Å§changes in its performance will help you identify potential issues early on, preventing further damage and ensuring ‚Å§consistent espresso quality.

Once you‚Äôve ‚Å£determined ‚Äãthat your ‚ÄãBreville BES870XL requires a new felt‚Å£ washer,the next step is to procure‚Äã a suitable replacement. You have several options:

## Alternatives to Buying Expensive Name-Brand Parts‚Å¢ for Breville Machines

While ‚Äåoriginal Breville parts are generally ‚Å£recommended, there are option ‚Å£strategies to consider ‚Äåthat ‚Å§could potentially save you‚Å¢ money without sacrificing quality:

* ‚Å§**Sourcing Compatible‚Å¢ Aftermarket Parts:** Thoroughly research aftermarket alternatives ‚Äçfrom reputable manufacturers, carefully examining reviews and specifications. Look for ‚Å¢materials similar to the original part and confirm compatibility with your specific BES870XL model.
* **Exploring ‚ÄãBulk Purchase Options:** Some retailers offer discounts on ‚Å¢bulk purchases of ‚Äãparts like the felt washer.‚Å¢ This is beneficial if you expect to perform regular maintenance or have multiple Breville ‚Å¢machines.
* ‚Å£**Refurbished or Used Parts (with‚Å£ Caution):** While riskier, you‚Å¢ may find used or refurbished ‚Å£felt ‚Äçwashers. Exercise extreme ‚Å§caution; ensure the part‚Å§ is in good condition and from a trustworthy source‚Å¢ to avoid installing a worn component.
* **DIY Solutions (Generally Not Recommended for ‚ÄåFelt Washers):** While some repairs lend ‚Å¢themselves to DIY solutions ‚Å§(like‚Äã cleaning or descaling), creating‚Å¢ your own ‚Å¢felt ‚Äãwasher is ‚Äågenerally inadvisable due to ‚Äãthe specific material and precision required for proper sealing. This could lead to machine damage‚Äå or inconsistent performance.

Ultimately, balancing cost savings with the potential risks associated with ‚Å£non-genuine ‚Å¢parts dictates the ‚Äãbest approach. Prioritize quality and compatibility to ‚Äãavoid long-term problems.

## Maintaining Your Breville BES870XL to Prevent Premature Felt Washer Failure

Proper maintenance significantly extends the lifespan of ‚Å¢your Breville BES870XL and its components, including the felt‚Äå washer.Here are some essential maintenance‚Å£ practices:

* **Regular Cleaning:** Clean the group head, portafilter, and filter baskets after each use to remove coffee residue. This prevents buildup that can affect pressure and extraction.
*‚Å¢ **Descaling:** Descale your machine every 2-3 months, depending on your water hardness, using a Breville-approved ‚Å§descaling solution. Mineral buildup can damage internal components, including the ‚Äåfelt washer.
* ‚Å£**Backflushing:** Backflush your machine regularly to remove coffee‚Äå oils from the brew path. This helps maintain optimal pressure and prevents clogging.* **Water Quality:** Use filtered water to minimize ‚Å¢mineral deposits‚Å§ and ensure optimal espresso quality. ‚ÄåAvoid using distilled water,as it can be‚Äå corrosive.
* **Proper Storage:** When not in ‚Äçuse, store your machine in a‚Å¢ dry ‚Äãand clean habitat.

By following‚Äå these ‚Å§maintenance tips,‚Äç you can significantly reduce the strain‚Å§ on the ‚Äãfelt washer and ‚Å¢other components, prolonging their lifespan‚Äå and ensuring consistent espresso quality. Regular maintenance‚Å¢ is far more‚Äå cost-effective than frequent repairs.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues ‚ÄåRelated to the Breville BES870XL group Head

Even with regular maintenance, you might‚Äç encounter some issues with your ‚ÄçBreville BES870XL group head.‚Å£ Here‚Äå are‚Äå some common problems ‚Äåand potential solutions:

* **Leaking Around‚Äå the Portafilter:** This is frequently enough caused by a‚Äå worn felt washer, but‚Å¢ it can also be due to ‚Å¢a dirty or damaged portafilter seal. ‚ÄåClean the portafilter seal and try replacing‚Äã the felt washer.
* **Low Pressure:** If the machine struggles to reach the correct pressure, check the water reservoir, pump,‚Å¢ and heating element. ‚Å¢A clogged‚Å§ water‚Å£ filter or a faulty pump can also cause low pressure.
* **Inconsistent Extraction:**‚Å£ Uneven‚Å£ tamping, incorrect grind ‚Äãsize, or a dirty group head can lead to inconsistent extraction. Experiment with different grind settings and tamping techniques and clean the group head thoroughly.

**Genuine Bug Report**

* Cannot login to my Tapblaze account, I type in and it prompts ‚ÄúProperty Null‚Äù and nothing happens.
* Could not add spaces or symbols to my Coffee Shop name, I could be wrong but I recall being able to do so in GPGP. I usually name places after my dog and I had to name my shop GoonsBrew instead of Goon's Brew. Not sure if it's a bug or not but it's kinda lame.

**The Wretched Energy Meter**  
*I've played these games before...* We all know her we all hate her. We know what she means. What I would love is for her to go away but she is most likely here to stay so if that is the case please just release a paid version of Good Coffee Great Coffee & I will just buy & play that. *Controversial take I know*, but I also know the Devs are most likely not going to actually get rid of this mechanic.

**Controls**  
Kinda weird, won't lie. I've played a few drink making games for the iPad, and otherwise, and this feels weird. The controls are not consistent and the game often misreads my input. It's funny, I felt like GPGP had too much dragging of items, and I feel like GCGC doesn't have enough dragging. Pouring liquid feels unnatural. I feel part of the charm of drink making games is learning to actually pour the drink. While I understand this is a choice made by the developers, there is still something off. I have an iPad Pro that has taken no damage and have tried my Apple Pencil, a Stylus & my Finger. The input still feels clunky.

**Story**  
Couldn't say, I've played a few IRL hours and I am on day 50 in game and I have not surpassed level 5. I have only met a small handful of story NPCs. I am a pretty efficient drink maker, it is just slow moving. It does feel a bit *too* slow for my taste but I like mundane tasks so I'll just keep making lattes and espressos. I do love Teddy.

**Game and Character Design**  
Love. Same as the last game. It's nice to see some recurring characters and some nods to GPGP. I also enjoy the new characters that are being introduced as things move along.

**$$$**  
At this point in time I would rate this a 2/5 on the microtransaction scale. The purchasable/earnable ratio is very 50/50. Some of the store items are cute but nothing really catches my eye at the moment. I assume we will continually get new content for years to come similar to GPGP. While GPGP always maintained, in my opinion, a good balance, I fear with the Energy Meter things for GCGC are not off to a great start.

So in general, I like it. I hope they refine input controls and hope to see a one-time-purchase work around for the energy meter. I love this type of game and I feel TapBlaze does it well, I just hope they do not get blinded by ad revenue. I am so serious I would rather just buy the game.",1,1740714368.0,GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee,0,0.67,False

This is particularly an issue now that I live with roommates. I keep my special dishes (ones I would care about if they broke) in my room, along with the food my dad buys for me that's less shareable. The walls are thin, one night I heard them say ""I wonder when \_\_ will notice I've eaten all her pocky sticks"". Which are not a cheap snack and I was also given them by my father as a gift. I never confronted her. I recently got slime to play with just to have something to fidget with and they asked to play with it too but I said no. I honestly do not trust they wouldn't drop it on the floor and then pretend like it didn't happen. They've also somehow lost all of the blankets I brought with me to share in the apartment, and one of them insisted we use one to put in a cardboard box outside for animals during the snow. So I did. That blanket is gone now. I prefer not to spend money so I don't like going out to eat often or getting coffee, going to the mall, getting nails done and such things girls do to spend time together, but I don't have a job so I don't really have that freedom. But it feels like they judge me for it and it's not that I don't want to spend time with them but that I don't want to spend money. How can I when they don't even pay me back for the utility bills?

One of my roommates just knocked into a painting I put up in our living room. It was done by a family friend who is a real artist (even though it shouldn't matter). They did not apologize to me about the painting, I just heard ""whoop"" and she walked out of the room before I realized. I don't know if it's just me being stingy or if I just have terrible luck with my stuff getting ruined, or if they're just careless. I don't like being this way because I don't feel like I ever see anyone else acting this way but I also feel like it's because my roommates don't really respect my things. I don't know what to do? I'm fairly upset about the painting, it has a very large indent in the middle of it now and I loved it a lot. I want to bring it back into my room to make sure it doesn't get damaged any further but I feel like that would be seen as stingy too. ",1,1740714073.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I'm not saying that our perceived financial superiority doesn't play a part at all. But that doesn't explain why myself and others have an easier time attracting better looking women who aren't just there for our money. I've had them come to my place right after just one coffee date.

I believe that changes in ideology and mindset have contributed to this. It's natural for women to become pickier when a society is thriving, but not to this extent. I believe the biggest factor is the fact that misandry has become far more extreme. Women's hatred/fear of men is at an all time high. Another factor is mental illness and social media addiction among western women. Many Colombian women for example have instagrams but they don't make it their entire lives like many western women do.

So, I started dating this girl and we hit it off and after 1 day of texting she send me her number to plan a date. We text a bit that same day and I tried to plan a date for the next weekend. 

She said she couldn't make it because she has private appointments (I know the reason, until here all good). She suggests to meet de weekend after, the one in two weeks, I agree.

The day before she told me that she couldn't make it and asks if I was still good to meet the one day later. i didn't want to give up  as we seem to match on a lot of things and we vibe really well, so I went on the first date with her.

The first date went great, we went for coffee and extended twice to do something else. Lot of personal questions were asked, she seemed really interested in me and I was in her.

After the date I asked for a second date and planned a date for next weekend because we are both busy during the week due to work and other appointments.

We both show each other a lot of interested and we have calls next to texting in mean time between the two dates.

We needed to cancel on the day of the second date because I went sick and didnt get better on time. I noticed the day before she was tired and she confirmed as well on the day we would meet she was still tired.

Because she was tired and I needed to recover a bit first from sickness I decided to wait 3 days to reach out again to give her space. She didn't reach out to me either in those 3 days.

I did reach out 3 days later with a simple question how she was doing, but was left on read and didn't got anything back.

We are both still on the app(she didn't unmatch) and she didn't block me on WhatsApp.

My overthinkers mind is questioning if she still needs more time and might reach out again. Other half of my brain is already in stage to let go and move on if needed, and thinking she ghosted me. 

I'm so confused...but I guess it's no harm in let it go and if she reaches out she reaches out and if not then not. It seems there is not much I can do at this point. But my overthinkers mind keeps overthink....",1,1740713819.0,Bumble,6,1.0,False

These microscopic pests thrive in a cat‚Äôs ear canal, leading to irritation, inflammation, and potential infections. Recognizing the signs of ear mites in cats early can help you take swift action to relieve your pet‚Äôs discomfort and prevent further complications.

# Common Signs of Ear Mites in Cats

**Frequent Scratching of the Ears**

* If your cat is persistently scratching their ears or rubbing their head against furniture, it could be a sign of ear mites. The itching is caused by the mites moving and feeding inside the ear canal.

**Head Shaking or Tilting**

* Cats with ear mites often shake their heads vigorously or tilt them to one side to relieve the irritation.

**Dark, Crusty Ear Discharge**

* One of the most noticeable signs of ear mites in cats is a dark, coffee-ground-like discharge in the ears. This buildup consists of dried blood, wax, and mite debris.

**Redness and Inflammation**

* The inner ear may appear red and swollen due to constant irritation and scratching. In severe cases, excessive scratching can cause sores or infections.

**Foul Odor from the Ears**

* An unpleasant smell coming from your cat‚Äôs ears may indicate a secondary bacterial or yeast infection caused by the presence of ear mites.

**Hair Loss Around the Ears**

* Persistent scratching can lead to bald patches around the ears and head. This is a sign that your cat is experiencing prolonged discomfort.

**Restlessness and Irritability**

* Cats suffering from ear mites often become restless or sensitive to touch due to the constant itching and irritation.

# What to Do If Your Cat Has Ear Mites

If you notice any of these signs of ear mites in cats, take the following steps:

* **Consult Your Veterinarian:** A vet can confirm the presence of mites and recommend the best treatment.
* **Use Prescribed Medications:** Medicated ear drops or [**spot-on treatments**](https://www.vetsupply.com.au/flea-and-tick-control/nexgard-spectra-for-cats/p3616.aspx?utm_source=seo&utm_medium=organic) effectively eliminate ear mites.
* **Clean Your Cat‚Äôs Ears Gently:** Remove debris using a vet-approved ear cleaner. Avoid using cotton swabs, as they can push mites deeper into the ear canal.
* **Treat All Pets in the Household:** Ear mites are highly contagious, so treating all cats and dogs in the home helps prevent reinfestation.

**Final Thoughts**

Recognizing the signs of ear mites in cats early can help prevent severe discomfort and complications. If you suspect your cat has ear mites, seek veterinary care promptly to ensure effective treatment and relief.",1,1740713603.0,u_MillerTissa,0,1.0,False

this church is connected to a theatre/restaurant i had been to many times before, but i never noticed this church.. i have never even heard of it. the advertisement addressed it as a ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs conference‚Äù night so we were excited to go.
when we showed up there was little to no outdoor lighting and the church is slightly hidden. not your typical church. the service starts at 7:30 but we show up at 7. we walk in and everyone is gathered near the entrance. immediately everyone is OVERLY friendly and kind. around 20-30 people. mostly teenagers- older adults. every single person introduces themselves and they make weird statements like ‚Äúwe never get visitors‚Äù ‚Äúhow did you find us‚Äù we thought it was strange but they all seemed very friendly. in front of us is a table with gift bags and they hand a gift to me, my mother and my sister. we open the gifts and inside is a ziplock taped together containing ground coffee. strange but i didn‚Äôt think much of it. then it was just some lip gloss coupons and a candle. we ask for water and they say ‚Äúsorry we have none‚Äù. keep that in mind. we go to sit down and we are one of the few people sitting. everyone else in the church walks out to change into dance costumes or ballet costumes. 
they start to blast music, dim the lights and everyone else in the church besides us was on stage dancing. we were sitting a few rows back in the middle aisle. they start running up and down the aisles dancing, doing ballet. at this point we were very confused. this was no normal church service. 
they get out these huge flags and start flag dancing. this goes on for 25 minutes‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt have the exact timeline for all of this because i wasn‚Äôt on my phone. the entire time i was there i didn‚Äôt see a single other person on their phone. no phones in sight so i avoided using mine. after the performance they all go and change and come back out sit down as if nothing happened. a younger girl brings out two water bottles and hands them to us. wait? i thought they didn‚Äôt have water? weird but oh well. i thought i was being paranoid but i had a bad feeling and didn‚Äôt drink the water. the preachers wife walks onto stage dressed very inappropriately and introduces herself as an apostle. my parents were upset by this. as she is preaching, she‚Äôs screaming yelling and has very slurred speech. i can‚Äôt understand a word of what she is saying. all i hear is ‚Äúrun to your mantle‚Äù being repeated. she was saying very cultish things. ‚Äúeveryone in this church was raised here‚Äù 
‚Äúwe are a family‚Äù ‚Äúthis is a lifelong church‚Äù 
she then explained how around the room there are 22 tables representing 22 groups. the group she was in was for ‚Äútable setting‚Äù learning how to set tables? why is there a group for that? not sure but they encourage my sister and i to check out the groups and find something. they shout us out saying ‚Äúwelcome our new visitors‚Äù and after awhile of her ‚Äúpreaching‚Äù she welcomes a younger girl onto stage. the girl says the apostle is her mentor and raised her. the girl has the same preaching style, yelling to the point i couldn‚Äôt understand her. we were only a few rows back but this was so loud my family was plugging their ears. i cannot express how loud it was. i couldn‚Äôt understand a word she said except for ‚Äúrun to your mantle‚Äù. the next woman comes onto stage introducing herself as a minister. between each person coming onto stage we would pray. during the prayer i would hear mumbling or chanting. i assumed they were speaking in tongues but there was no interpreter. i noticed they did this speaking in tongues thing a lot throughout the night. the last woman is speaking about her dedication to the church and my family and i decide we need to leave. the people try to convince us to stay saying there is a dinner afterwards and they prepared a feast. we politely declined. to make it less obvious we leave one by one. i was scared so my mother and i left at the same time. (this was past 9 pm) we are exiting the building and the woman who greeted us when we walked in was sitting on a chair in the doorway. i waved as i walked out and she didn‚Äôt say a word. just stared at me. as we tried to exit there was a magnetic lock on the door and it took us a minute to get out. there‚Äôs more to the story but this is the best summary i can give. if anyone has questions please feel free to ask. i‚Äôve since researched this church and seen other people claiming it‚Äôs a cult. my cousin dated the preachers son years back and confirmed this as well. there‚Äôs a lot of crazy lore here. someone who escaped this cult has done a podcast interview about it. this place is trying to recruit new people especially women. could be polygamy.

We are not doing traditional dances or speeches because it‚Äôs just not us. We‚Äôre really going for a nice dinner party vibe.

WIBTAH to show her husband everything I documented between us?","Thank you in advance if you take the time to read! **T**oo **L**ong **D**idn't **R**ead is at the bottom. 

A married woman (40F) and I (29M single) spent about 4 years eye fucking each other in a religious setting (non denom. Christian church, she's the worship leader) during the Sunday service.¬†It started with me noticing her staring at me, if I caught her staring, her eyes would shoot down to her sheet music. That turned into a couple of quick glances which over time after getting comfortable with each other, turned into prolonged eye contact spread throughout the service.¬†For the last year and a half we connected on social media (Facebook) through a couple of pages she administers (she has a lot) and for about three months on Spotify as a form of sexting. We'd arrange artist titles in the recently played section, songs, playlists ect. to communicate. We never engaged in anything physical, just the eye contact while she was at her piano and through social media. I work on Sunday mornings and would use my lunch break to attend the service; with not a lot of time for chatting afterwards I would typically bolt for the door to get back to work in a timely manner (I work for a local media company, tv/radio). We had never spoken face¬†to face about her being married until I got an email from her through work last¬†February; it was a press release for her husband's new breakfast house. I desperately didn't want to know if she was married or not; I figured the eye contact was enough; but temptation got the best of me and we spent the rest of the year finding new ways to flirt and sneak glances at each other. We picked up on each other's social media ques and found new ways to connect online. I'd have to type another 5 paragraphs to give you examples but¬†we didn't talk to each other about¬†it in¬†person until the last Sunday of this past year.

Leading up to the last Sunday of this past year, we got into¬†an¬†argument online due to a miscommunication, (she thought I was trying to rat¬†on her) so she took some shots at me. It made me mad enough I wanted us to start being honest with each other in person about what we were doing. So, last Sunday of the year I asked her if we were ok and if she was ok with our¬†back and forth on social media. She hit me with ""I have no idea what you're talking about"". I'm immediately thinking¬†**""ok, she's going to play dumb with me isn't she.""**¬†Instead of dropping it and walking away (which I should have) I kept prying her looking for some honesty. I showed her a couple of examples on my¬†phone involving **""just kiss¬†me"" ""all my love"" ""dreaming of you""**¬†ect. Eventually she slips and says¬†***"" I don't know if you were expecting something more.....???""***¬†with her eyes squinted and shaking her head which I took as, (**flirting only, no sex**)¬†She walks away and says¬†***""you're gonna have to give me more details, I'm still lost!""***. I'm standing there in silence, in limbo and my body language is saying you know damn well what I'm talking about!¬†Still not admitting she's on the receiving¬†end, In my head I'm saying\*¬†**""fuck this I'm out""**, I told her¬†**""I'm not trying to make your life a burden""**¬†and ""¬†**LOOK, new year new beginnings**"" I asked her if she wanted me to stop attending that church and unfollow her on her social media pages; she tells me¬†***""no I want you up here and I appreciate your support of my school""***¬†(she runs a private school and that's one of the fb pages we would use) and in a condescending way says she'll be¬†***""praying for me (*****bullshit*****) and hoping I can work out whatever confusion I'm having.""***¬†At this point she's basically saying¬†***"" I'm never having an honest conversation with you about this.***

**Side note-**¬†A couple years ago during a college¬†age bible study; a small gossip session came up talking about her lying about her religion to¬†get her position up there; (I have no idea what she gets paid) but something about her being a Buddhist? The¬†elder who runs the class didn't deny it, I put that one in my back pocket and I didn't ask how they came about that info or why she hasn't been questioned about it. I'm still a regular at this bible study. She's seen me talk to these people regularly and one of their parents is an elder. Maybe paranoia¬†started to cut deep and she's starting to think I've been telling them everything about the two of us? She dumped a lot¬†of books off her GoodReads profile and made it private a couple of days after we talked.¬†

I stare¬†at her blank face¬†like¬†**""c'mon are you shitting me right now...""**. I pull my phone back out to show her another example and someone she works with at the church walks up and interrupts our conversation to talk to her; and knowing the talk was going nowhere I use that to walk away and tell her to have a great week. During that conversation I asked her if she was¬†the only administrator of one of the pages we would connect through (she said yes) and a couple of hours later I found she had blocked me on that page and on Spotify, but not on her personal fb profile. I sent a message to her personal profile apologizing and saying¬†**""if we couldn't be honest about it it wasn't worth our energy anyways""**¬†she replied with a thumbs up, not really denying or admitting anything (she had sent me a friend request a¬†month earlier) I didn't bother opening it. Two days later I got an email from her with the lead minister cc'd saying¬†***""Your conversation and fb message made me uncomfortable and I think it would be best if you didn't reach out to me again. Talk to (lead minister) if you need help processing anything.""***¬†Instead of sending¬†a response full¬†of¬†rage, I reply to the email with¬†**""I can clear this up, huge misunderstanding.""**¬†I tell myself fuck it and send her another message on fb trying to reverse everything I had done on her social media pages the last two years to try and clean the slate. She opens it but doesn't reply. Two days later I got a call from the lead minister and he asked me if I had been served with VPO (victim protective order) papers yet.¬†**(WHAT THE FUCK!!??)**¬†is screaming in my head,¬†someone from the sheriff's¬†office sends them a week later. A court date was set and I'm shaken and pissed off out of my mind. The report she had written is littered with falsehoods, inaccuracies and the word ""cryptic"" scattered all over like there was some evil meaning behind the way I worded the messages I sent her; also, a conversation I had with an elder (the leader of the bible study mentioned in the side note) of that church that she could overhear she described as being aggressive and unusual. She used a cyber stalking narrative on me and painted me out to be a creep that she worded in her report as becoming way too hyper fixated on her school and she feared for her safety and the safety of her students. She blocked me on her personal profile a couple of days later but not on all of the other pages she admins (including her husband's breakfast house and a business fair page for her school). The second I was served papers I put my printer to work; emails, anything Facebook related I had screen recorded anytime I reacted to any of her posts or stories on Facebook keeping in mind the activity might bite me in the ass one day (sure enough it did).

I documented all of our back and forth on Spotify and used Google Maps ""back in time"" feature to print off my locations to show I had never come close to her school or the town her school was located in during any functions she advertised because I made a rule for myself when I started following that fb page...¬†**UNLESS SHE PERSONALLY INVITES YOU TO AN EVENT, DO NOT DARE SHOW YOUR FACE AROUND HER KIDS, FACULTY OR STUDENTS**¬†with the off chance of a full on affair sometime down the road. I show up to court with half of a forest in 5 separate folders. Her husband was with her and I don't know if she was scared shitless of what I might say or what she was thinking was in one of those folders; but the judge starts by asking her if she wants a permanent VPO and she answers by asking to give me whatever the sentence is that won't hurt my record (judge seemed surprised). I told the judge what I offered her on that Sunday. The¬†Judge-¬†***""is this¬†true?""***¬†she answers¬†***""Yes, but I didn't know it would go this¬†far""***¬†**YOU'RE THE ONE WHO PUT US HERE!!**¬†She agreed to dismiss the case if I stopped attending the Sunday morning service. ""**Fine"",**¬†I agreed without raising¬†my voice. Now the regulars, some of these people I've known most of my life have been wondering where I have been the last 2 months and I have to tell all of them and my parents I'm banned but I'm not banned because she doesn't want me up there at the same time she's up there anymore. I haven't talked about it to anyone but the lead minister yet; and he didn't tell me about the VPO papers until after I told him it was a misunderstanding...¬†¬†

Four years of this flirting, I've done nothing but keep my mouth shut about it and she's too much of a coward to have an¬†honest conversation with me about what we¬†were doing. She gets away with her¬†hands clean and I'm exiled from that church on Sunday mornings with the weirdo/creep narrative she painted me into hanging over my head. I do not know who or how many people she has told but judging from the glances and from the awkward silences when Sunday mornings are brought up during the P.M bible studies I imagine word's gotten around. How convenient of her to pull this crap when¬†**I WAS THE ONE TO ASK IF SHE WANTED ME TO END WHAT WE WERE DOING**. I should just take my lumps and try to forget about it, but to¬†**HAVE FUCKING PAPERS SERVED TO ME**¬†because she's too afraid to say to my face¬†***""yes, please stop coming up here, stop following my social media pages"".*** That would mean admitting I was in in the wrong for what I was doing and basically admitting she was enabling it for as long as she did which could have jeopardized her position up there. So she took this path instead and stabbed everyone in the back¬† she could to look like a victim/can do no wrong saint. Assuming this is the first time she's done something like this; it either scared¬†her straight or I've just opened Pandora's box for her. The husband's at his coffee shop on Sundays in their¬†hometown and she's 40 mins away at this church; if she gets bored enough and finds another opportunity to play this game with someone else (who will probably play it smoother than I did) I have a feeling she will. I planned on taking everything that happened between us to my grave. I never spoke about anything we were doing with¬†**ANYONE and I NEVER WANTED TO**, I still haven't but all of my fucks are starting to fly out of the window. They've been married 20 something¬†years, I don't know where her husband would draw the line in terms of infidelity; but if I found out my wife was pulling this crap with a kid ten years younger than her I'd have some serious doubts about her likelihood to stay faithful the¬†rest of our¬†lives.

Us hyperaware of each other as long as we have, I donate money to your¬†school (she refunded), I only sent two messages to your personal profile that¬†**YOU**¬†sent¬†**ME**¬†a friend request to.¬†**SHE'S THE ONE WHO SENT ME INVITATIONS TO LIKE HER SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES!!**¬†And that's grounds for a VPO? Yet you're on that¬†stage singing about Amazing Grace?? **fuck you.** All of those Sunday's if I wasn't watching you, your¬†eyes were burning a hole in me while I wasn't¬†**""paying attention""**. Overtime I became so desensitized to it, but it's like she would molest me with her eyes and stare my ass down waiting for me to make eye contact with her to get her weekly dose of validation from me (regardless of whether or not her kids were there¬†with her). I kept my mouth shut all those Sundays because I didn't want to be a fucking prude and THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME!?¬†

¬†I can't even begin to imagine how she would have spun it if I ever went to one of her damn fundraisers in person.¬†I was never sure what the endgame of this relationship would be, I didn't know I was supposed to take that email as a cease and desist because did¬†**I EVER**¬†think she was going to throw me in a courtroom!?¬†**NO.**¬†I can't believe I let myself get sucked in for¬†as¬†long as I did, I'm a piece of crap for letting it happen, I'm not proud of it, and I shouldn't have let it drag on for as long as I¬†did but I can't take it back. I won't lie, it was incredibly intoxicating at times and at times frustrating as¬†hell. Mixing religion, lust and infidelity is an incredibly twisted combination¬†that I should have never¬†dipped my¬†toes in and never will again. The more eye contact we made the¬†further away I strayed from the reason I was going up there in the¬†first place. It was nothing but a slow descent¬†into an unhealthy and toxic relationship that seemed impossible to end with us just being friends and nothing else.

This woman probably thinks she's gotten away with murder, it feels like she has. If she really was any kind of ""Christian"" at heart and felt concerned after me talking with her; I imagine she would have spoken with any of the elders or staff members that Sunday afternoon and they could have had an intervention with me; but a little too many loose ends to worry about though huh? So you send an email to the lead minister (your¬†boss) who's only been there half a year, act like a victim of stalking, try to turn me into a villain and have the law get rid of me. This woman is sick and so full of crap. I could show the lead minister what I have, send her husband all the papers I printed off and let him draw his own conclusions which could lead to counseling, him running like hell or nothing at all **or**¬†say ""fuck it"" all together and move on with my life. Maybe something else that I'm not thinking of? What do you think I should do?

**TLDR:**¬†Caught the worship leader of a church staring at me week after week, eventually it turned into prolonged eye contact, this went on for 4 years. The last year and a half we connected on social media. She DARVO'd me and tried to pin me with a VPO. Would I be an asshole to show the husband and lead minister what I documented between us or drop it and move on?

1izy6ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1izy6ui/advice_when_none_of_your_friends_like_each_other/,Advice when none of your friends like each other.,"I have no idea how much of this is an autistic experience and how much it a ""keeping friends in your 20s/30s is hard"" experience. But this sub has been immensely helpful the last two times I posted so let's try again. 

I make friends quite easily. The double whammy of taking nothing personally unless someone is overtly trying to hurt my feelings and a deep genuine belief that most people are interesting and kind if you put them in the right environment and get them talking about the right things means I have a broad range of friends who all have very different ways of socialising. 

This is mostly fine. I can go to the game shop and yell about how fucking broken MTG is, in a conversation that is overlapping 6 different ways and then remember not to talk like that with my girlfriend because she hates raised voices and being interrupted. I can get coffee with one friend who I know is as disorganised as me and we will both be an hour late. Then go to another friends house and leave with 45min buffer cause people being late upsets him. I can drink during DnD with one group and not the other because the second house doesn't like alcohol. 

And I enjoy all those things because I like all those people. And being aware of your behaviour with different groups is part of having friends. 

Except when I want to plan a party or outing. 

The last 3 times I have planned something has ended with someone leaving early and crying. Because someone always dislikes how another person socializes or interacts with the rest of the group. 

I guess I don't mind having a lot of very separate friend groups. But it is starting to make me a little depressed and jaded. 

My birthday is coming up and all I wanted was all my friends at one event but that can't happen. And I keep thinking it will be the same for other big life events. I just want all my friends at things like housewarmings and (maybe someday) my wedding.

Yesterday after work and picking up the kids and dropping them off with their dad/my husband - I'll call him James(m42) - I(f41) went to Walmart. I told James that I would be an hour (because I'm a child and he always demands I tell him exactly how long I am going to be and then angry texts me if im late, or even if im just late in his mind - yes one time he even accused me of being super late, and then using Google maps I showed him the exact number of minutes I was gone which was what I said and he was shocked because he thought I was way longer based on only his feelings... but that's for another day). When I got there I realized Easter stuff was out and I wanted to look WITHOUT KIDS (rare) before it was picked over so I texted James that I'd be longer, then I saw that there were clearance sales on clothes (I have 3 boys so I always try to save money because you know, the economy, but it takes time to price check everything), so I just texted I'll be as long as I'm going to be. 

I texted at 715 that I was paying, did he want a coffee or anything. He said no, he's putting the kids to bed, please be quiet when I get in (weird since he almost never puts the kids to bed and just lets them run around until I initiate the bedtime routine, which is usually closer to 8. Whatever). I replied ""Cant you wait til I'm home?"" He responds, ""It's 730, 3 hours have gone by (reality: I was at Walmart less than 2 at that point), (3m) is really upset and keeps crying I want mommy"". I say ""I'm omw, I'll come right in, tell him I'll be there in 5"". (I'm literally copying my texts & time stamps as I write this.)

I get home, I go to the door, it's locked. I don't have a key (I have a borrowed vehicle and he has the van because he was hit by someone on Monday and his car is totaled). I text that I don't have the key. He comes and lets me in all grumpy. I go to bedroom, all kids are awake, I don't know what the problem is/was. (3m) is whining - but to be fair he's a velcro child so he's always whining for me and following me around the house. All 3 littles climb on me and I lay with them until they sleep. James goes to prep their backpacks for the morning as he is the one who does the morning run (I work at 6am). Unfortunately, the backpacks were in the borrowed vehicle I was driving, which should have been obvious. But he texted, ""I can't find backpacks, make sure they are here for morning"". I texted back that they were in vehicle and I'd get them after the kids were asleep. He texted ""Make sure you bring them all in.""

(Now some women have husbands who might go and bring the groceries in, or at least the backpacks they need to pack. Some have husbands who would do it *without even being asked*. Not me. Is it wrong that I'm irritated he can't walk out the front door and 15 steps to the driveway to get either? But alas, I don't say a word about it, I just agree). So I do. At 840. When I leave the room at 839 (time stamped by text) he is sitting on our bed eating - which I HATE, I hate when he eats in the bedroom but who cares what I think - and watching a movie or playing a video game, I care not to check.

So I go drag all the groceries and backpacks in. I get everything put away. I go to see if he wants to see the pants I told him I bought for him and wanted to show him before bed. Open door. He's out cold. I say cool. Put pants in return pile. Obviously he was REALLY keen on them. 

Skip to this morning...

I was wfh this am, up before 6. He gets up whenever he does. Probably late - he is always in a rush in the am, yelling at kids and grumbling/cursing under his breath about everything and anyone (me, I'm anyone). I've previously asked if he wants me to wake him up, if that would help. I've gently recommended he could wake up earlier to make the morning easier. He says he'll try. But every morning, without fail, he's a stressed out ahole to everyone. 

So this particular morning he's freaking out about the backpacks. I guess 5m's spare clothes were wet so he had to re-pack him new clothes. He starts on about how if the backpacks were in last night he could have done it then. And I say, as sweetly as possible because I dont want my kids to have a bad day, ""If you chose to get up and pack the backpacks instead of watching tv last night this wouldnt be an issue"". (I hate ""disrespecitng my spouse"" in front of my kids but it's also gotten to the point where I don't want my kids to think his behaviour is normal. So I tell them, ""It's a daddy thing, you've done nothing wrong, he doesn't handle adversity well, his failure to plan is not our issue, lets have a good day"" type thing). Anyways, as I say this I'm hugging the kids goodbye before they leave, and he's stil flying around grumbling and he says - I kid you not - MOMMY IS GASLIGHTING ME!

I said ""I'm gaslighting you?"" He then actually used the words ""changing reality"". So I said ""I'm changing reality by saying you could have gotten up instead of watching tv. I said that I brought the backpacks in immediately after I left the room from putting the kids to sleep and you could have gotten up to get things ready but you didn't... so I'M the gaslighter?""

To which he confirmed yes, I am in fact, gaslighting him.

husband?

1izy4kh,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee/comments/1izy4kh/my_thoughts_so_far_its_fun/,My thoughts so far‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fun!,"I know there‚Äôs been a lot of mixed feelings since last night, both good and bad. As someone that has been a gamer their whole life and works in gaming, I wanted to share my thoughts on the game so far. 

It‚Äôs very fun and addicting! All issues aside, once you get past the learning curve (and there is a pretty substantial one compared to GPGP) and get in a groove, the game is very enjoyable. It‚Äôs not w/o its annoyances, which I‚Äôll list in a bit, but overall I found myself wanting to come back and play more every time. 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of people complaining about how difficult it is compared to GPGP and I admit, it is! GPGP was so easy to get into and GCGC just requires a lot more trial and error. But I actually enjoy that. There‚Äôs a challenge to finding that sweet spot and I found it entertaining, I always want to do better. 

Now for the not so good stuff:
- It can be a bit repetitive. So was GPGP, but GCGC feels like it a drags a bit more. Hopefully something that will get better as they continue to add features. 
- The instructions could be better. While I enjoy the challenge, sometimes the instructions are just outright horrible and poorly structured. 
- Days go by way too fast considering making an order takes way longer than in GPGP. 
- The game UI and upgrade options are very lackluster, but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll add more with time. 

- THE BUGS! I get it, the game just came out and there will be A LOT of fine tuning and updates over time (hopefully soon), but for a game that so many people had access to the beta and played for so long prior to launch, some of the bugs are very basic things. The ones I‚Äôve noticed so far are:
     - If you decide to play an ad between chapters (after the news segment) to get a free gem, you can‚Äôt exit out of it right away and the next chapter is already playing. So I‚Äôll often get in when a customer has already ordered and an hour or more has passed in the day. 
     - Swiping back and forth while preparing an order isn‚Äôt smooth. It jumps a lot and is very prone to accidental clicks that completely mess up your recipe. 
     - Some actions don‚Äôt always read, like turning off the coffee machine. I‚Äôve burnt way too many espresso. 
     - Recipes aren‚Äôt always accurate. I‚Äôve made some items perfectly and still get an angry customer. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve missed some stuff, but overall I have to say the game was worth the wait. If you‚Äôre struggling to get in the groove, stick to it! It gets easier and a lot more fun. ",2,1740712361.0,GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee,1,0.75,False

What do I do now?,"My mom picked up a new cat a few years ago. But we can't make her befriend our other cats no matter what for two years that we tried. The only solution my mom came up with is to have the new cat to live in my room, separated from others. 

(The cat's name is Coffee) 
Coffee and I are not exactly happy about this situation. Coffee does love me and see me as her owner now. I do tolerate her as well even if this is a situation where I am very much unwilling. But it feels like we both are trapped.

She screams almost every night, scratching on the door of my room to be free. Often refuses to eat. But as soon as we let her out, a fight breaks up, gruesome enough to warrant a vet visit and a a pricy one.

I have severe depression and am recovering from PTSD. Loud noises can lead me into tears and hysterical mood.  You can see how being suddenly awaken by screeching and meowing in the middle of the night is not great for me. I have no choice but to hiss at coffee to shut up. This messes with my sleeping schedule and worsens my mood swings.

My mom is fully aware that that both I and Coffee are severely unhappy. But it seems like we can't do anything about it. She doesn't want to give Coffee away. Can't take coffee into her room. I know my mom will get quite some critique in the comments. But she's working her butt off to keep our family fed, and barely gets any sleep as well. I am a 20 year old who still can't find a job. Helping with cats is at least some help i can provide.
This feels like a hopeless situation. I realise that when i move to live alone, I'll have to abandon Coffee who is by now attached to me. I want to be as far from this cat as physically possible, but i also don't want to make Coffee suffer loneliness.

I need advice on how to keep my sanity and maybe even help Coffee.",2,1740712321.0,Pets,9,0.62,False

Am I in the wrong here?,"So I‚Äôm a grad student right? And it‚Äôs a small community, so it‚Äôs basically high school again. This kind of drama happens all the time. I haven‚Äôt dealt with this kind of thing since high school, so I‚Äôm a bit baffled. So here‚Äôs what‚Äôs up:

I‚Äôve been close friends with a woman from my class. At some point, I started sort of getting feelings, so early last semester I wrote her a letter. Nothing gushy. It was very matter-of-fact, and I gave her every opportunity to say ‚Äòno thanks.‚Äô She gets back to me and says she wants to meet at this local bar and talk it out. There, she says she‚Äôd rather remain friends. I took it like a champ, raised my glass, did a cheers, and we went on with our lives.

Since then, we‚Äôve hung out like an average of 3 days a week, usually just the two of us. Nothing crazy though‚Äî concerts, drinks, coffee, studying, etc. And the whole time I‚Äôve made every effort to be clear that, while I may have questioned my feelings in the past, I value her friendship too much to jeopardize it by, say, making moves on her. And by all accounts, she‚Äôs acknowledged that, least of all by continuing to hang out with me (she initiates most of the time).

Then comes my birthday. Me, her, some other classmates, and my brother and cousin all go to Casa Bonita (the place from South Park). If you‚Äôve never been to Casa Bonita, it‚Äôs an experience. No one goes for the food. Usually you eat, then you go party, drink, see the shows, etc. Well all my classmates, including her, kinda just abruptly left without much explanation after eating. Her issue was that she was hungover.

It bothered me a bit, but I wasn‚Äôt mad. More confused and a little hurt that they (note: all of them, not just her) left so early. The following Sunday, I pick her up from the airport. She can tell something is off about me, so she asks, ‚Äúdoes it have something to do with Casa Bonita?‚Äù I tell her yes, and I‚Äîas nicely as I can‚Äî explain what upset me and how it made me feel. She immediately apologizes and explains that she was hungover. She then apologizes again ‚Äúwithout qualification.‚Äù She says something about how she probably needs to cut back on drinking, and I offer to go sober with her for February‚Äî detox a bit.

A week goes by and all seems normal. Then last weekend she suddenly stopped responding to my texts. I didn‚Äôt think much of it since she was probably busy, but I get a vibe that something is off. On Monday, when we have a class together, she moved seats to get away from me. I text her and ask her if I did something wrong, and she doesn‚Äôt respond. So I ask our mutual friend, and she confirms that she is, in fact, annoyed with me.

What annoyed her, apparently, was that, by expressing what I felt about the Casa Bonita situation, and my offering to detox with her, I had given off ‚Äúcontrolling boyfriend vibes.‚Äù So she decided she needed space. Before I knew about the detox thing, I thought this was an overreaction to a bit of a nothingburger, but since being informed about the detox thing, I think this is maybe a little more my fault.

That being said, I‚Äôm still a bit baffled by how she handled the situation. We‚Äôve always had very direct communication (see the letter situation above), so I figured if I ever crossed a boundary she would say something. But instead she kinda just cut me off without saying anything.

I guess the question is not ‚Äúam I in the wrong here?‚Äù but rather ‚Äúhow much am I in the wrong here?‚Äù Is it still uncool for her to handle it this way? And what, if anything, could I do to prove that I‚Äôm only interested in a friendship and to repair things?",2,1740712222.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,1.0,False

Alright...I FINALLY got my hands on the Scent Lab collection to review for you all and on the same day got my Spring 2 scents to review for you all.  This is going to be a doozy, so get some popcorn and some tea and let's DIVE RIGHT IN!  Starting off with the Scent Lab Collection!!!!

* **Wild Vanilla** (Whipped Vanilla, Tonka Bean, Sugared Musk) - Funny to start with the IT girl of this collection as it's been sold out for quite a while and a hard one to locate (unless physically at the stores).  To me, Wild Vanilla is decent but definitely aiming at the floral side of vanilla versus the gourmand side.  It smells smooth and lovely enough if not a bit light of a scent to me.  I don't know, kind of the basic floral vanilla scent, but it's nice!
* **Amber Suede** (Warm Amber, Vanilla Flower, Sparkling Bergamot) - We just got Vanilla Suede a few months ago and we're already with Amber Suede now?  I definitely get similarities for sure and the bergamot is really popping off on this one too.  It smells nice too, a little clean, but decent overall.  
* **Zesty Peach** (Peach Nectar, Sugar Crystals, Luminous Musk) - This is the peach scent of peach scents to me...even better than stuff like Pretty as a Peach, Honeysuckle Peach Tea and even Diamond of the Season.  This is on point the juiciness of a peach and really sticks to its fruity core.  Really simple but nailed it and one of my favorites of the thirteen!
* **Coconut Nectar** (Fresh Coconut, Palm Leaf, Salted Woods) - Considering how lacking tropical is being this year (with the only scent being Waikiki Beach Coconut) I'm more than happy that this scent is not following the sunscreen-heavy like scent and instead made Coconut Nectar into something that's like Fresh Coconut Colada minus the pineapple note.  I do get the woody notes in the back, but it's definitely sweet coconut mostly.
* **Vibrant Jasmine** (Jasmine Petals, Watery Pear, Kiss of Vanilla) - Very strong jasmine scent here and super floral with a touch of aquatic sweetness that's coming from watery pear.  It's a bold scent for sure and I will admit, this one is not quite my jam...I feel like still Night-Blooming Jasmine is the best jasmine scent for me and others just don't hit that same itch.  
* **Warm Tonka** (Tonka Bean, Warm Musk, Soft Sandalwood) - I haven't really smelled a near pure tonka scent and smelling this one...it's giving me warmth and a bit of a cinnamon-esque bite to it which is really nice here.  Though I get a small earthy scent too which it could be from the sandalwood perhaps?  It's a decent scent though!
* **Delicate Iris** (Gilded Iris, Touch of Rose, Caramel Musks) - This one is one of the lighter scents of the bunch and for me that's probably for the best since rose is involved!  I like how light and slightly sweet of a scent it is.  Kind of wish it had a bit more power behind it due to it's VERY airy quality, but I found myself enjoying it.
* **Blackberry Burst** (Juicy Blackberry, Sparkling Pomegranate, Hint of Musk) - Like Zesty Peach, Blackberry Burst is just straight up a fruity scent.  However we JUST had Cue the Confetti two months ago and that didn't quite impress me and this one is riding that same coattail.  It's a little juicier and less boozy, but then it's like A Thousand Christmas Wishes or Blackberry & Basil while good scents, this one feels like it's missing something about it.
* **Clean Musk** (Cashmere Musk, Sheer Jasmine, Velvet Amber) - I think the one I knew was going to be a hard one to talk about, Clean Musk at least has a slightly stronger scent profile than Delicate Iris, but its not by much.  It's a clean floral scent and definitely screams POTENTIAL LAUNDRY scent, but it too doesn't last long on my skin.  From the few minutes I did have, it smelled nice and bright and clean, but longevity was the issue for me.
* **Oceanside Splash** (Fresh Water, Lily, Driftwood) - The lone aquatic scent and it's fine, it's nothing complex to me (those scent notes seem pretty basic).  I mostly get the lily and driftwood but it is surrounded by the water note.  Kind of floral, kind of woody and mostly aquatic.  I will say it doesn't smell like any other B&BW scent I have which I had thought maybe it'd pull from Underwater Oasis, Endless Sea, Sea Salt Coast, maybe even Aqua Hour or On the Horizon).  Though no, it kind of smells like its own thing.
* **Smooth Sandalwood** (Sandalwood, Fluffy Musk, Fresh Spices) - Yeah the main wood-centric scent of the thirteen and it's kind of riding the middle between Lost in Santal & Sunwashed Santal.  It's just mostly the wood so it's not sweet like the latter nor is it funky like the former, it's just straight wood for me.  It's fine, but nothing that I'd personally return to (especially since Sunwashed Santal is leagues better.
* **Velvet Cedar** (Rich Cedarwood, Warm Chamomile, Crystalized Sugar Cane) - Oh, I suppose there's another woody scent to deal with!  I do like the fact that this one smell a little more spicy than Smooth Sandalwood, but the spiciness kills out the sugar cane note and I'm not sure where the chamomile is in the scent really...nothing about it is really giving me floral.  This one I would say is a smidge better than the previous scent though...a little more memorable.
* **Toasted Pistachio** (Pistachio, Almond Blossom, Whipped Vanilla) - I would have said this one should've been the popular one because a LOT of people wanted a pistachio scent and has been teased twice last year (Sweetheart Cherry and Vacation Vibe).  This one though is purely pistachio with a bit of that toastiness about it and a smidge of sweetness from the almond blossom and vanilla notes.  This is definitely for those looking in the gourmand element.  

===========

**Fav to Least Fav:**

* Zesty Peach
* Toasted Pistachio
* Coconut Nectar
* Wild Vanilla
* Warm Tonka
* Clean Musk
* Amber Suede
* Delicate Iris
* Blackberry Burst
* Vibrant Jasmine
* Velvet Cedar
* Smooth Sandalwood
* Oceanside Splash

Honestly, Since the Scent Lab collection was Spring 1...it just meant it was just a massive release bomb the largest the company has done in a long time and considering this was only released as minis and JUST only the FFMs this was a pretty cool and interesting release with most of the scents actually being decent to be honest.  I think the only ones that I would probably skip over is Smooth Sandalwood and Oceanside Splash...neither really doing it for me and there are other related scents that were much better IMHO.

==============================================

Moving on to SPRING 2!

* **Sweet Carrot Cake** (Sweet Cream Cheese Frosting, Fluffy Carrot Cake, Cinnamon Spice) - Kind of surprised Easter is only in minis this year (been a while).  Anywho, this one replaced last year's Daffodil Daydreams and this is kind of an interesting scent because it does remind me of the 3-wick candle I own already and I have been clamoring for this one to become body-care!  For me, it's sweet, but there's a lot of a caramel-ish cinnamon coffee cake tone to it which I like so I'm not angry at it.  Yeah, kind of a thrown-out there scent, but it's decent for me!
* **Cinderella** (Gardenia Petals, Enchanting Musk, Sapphire Blue Amber) - So the main set is another Collaboration though a BIG one with Disney this time.  Though call me less than impressed that all 6 ended up being floral scents.  Anyways, Cinderella's scent is kind of familiar to me, but I'm not quite sure where?  A slightly sweeter Gingham perhaps?  It's got a floral sweetness and something slightly watery about it, but not quite sure where that's coming from (maybe the amber?).  It's fine overall, but nothing I'd hover towards.
* **Jasmine** (Sparkling Jasmine Flower, Jeweled Currants, Soft Woods) - I'm not surprised that Jasmine's scent would well...have jasmine involved in some way.  To me, the scent is giving me Luminous and Platinum vibes for whatever reason it could be despite the fact none of the 3 are really related to one another.  I think it's that it smells like a legit perfume.  It's nice and different that's for sure.
* **Ariel** (Sea Salt Breeze, Golden Citrus, Coral Waters) - Now this one feels familiar to me as well, smells kind of like either Underwater Oasis or perhaps Endless Sea for some reason.  It's a bright, sweet, aquatic scent here and that's really all I got for this one.  I kind of tired myself out from the aquatic scents this year already so this is just kind of meh to me right now.
* **Tiana** (Delicate Water Lily, Gilded Amber, Shimmering Bayou Woods) - Tiana's scent is a bit fruity for some reason to me and well there's no fruit note in here so I'm a bit curious.  There is an odd funky note in the drydown as well that I can't really decode (maybe the water lily?).  It's kind of a clean-ish aquatic scent, but it gives me a little bit of shampoo vibes even?  Not my favorite of the 6...
* **Belle** (Rose Petals, Sparkling Buttercup, Whipped Vanilla) - Of the 6, this one was the one I KNEW that it was a repackage for sure.  It smells just like Whipped Rose Latte (from three years back) or Whipped Rose & Vanilla (from 2 years back).  That said, maybe it isn't because there's a little extra bit of floral in the scent (which could be easily from the buttercups which wasn't a scent note in the aforementioned scents).  Maybe it's a tweaked repeat, but it's still a REALLY good scent here!
* **Moana** (Lush Green Palms, Plumeria Breeze, Coconut Water) - The last scent is Moana's and it kind of makes up for how lacking the Tropical collection is feeling this year sadly.  The first thing I thought of was that actual Plumeria scent but this scent tones down the pungent floral here to make it workable and then the green palms add that grassy/beachy vibes and then the coconut water gives it some sweetness.

==========================

Spring 2 was definitely for promoting the Disney set and that unfortunately made the rest of Spring 2 feel unloved especially Easter and Tropical.

  
Easter was the first to be previewed and it turns out it was just only Tutti Frutti Candy and Sweet Carrot Cake and they were only released in minis (which is funny considering they had other products released like candles, soaps, and wallflowers).  I shouldn't have been surprised since last year's Easter was kind of messy of a release.

Then came the Tropical Collection which included 4 of the 5 scents from last year's Tropical; Bahamas, Waikiki, Costa Rica, and Thailand (surprised Fiji Sunshine Guava-tini isn't part of the set).  That said, Thailand is online exclusive too.  Yeah, Tropical was really the set that suffered the most for 2025 so far.

The big releases as I said was the Collaboration with Disney.  It's a really pretty set and definitely fans will go nuts over this, but all 6 of them being mostly florals (with the slight exception of Ariel being aquatic) is kind of madness for me.  You can tell that some of them was just not my style.

Oh...and Sweet Pea got a redesign, woo?

Foxy was asleep on the bed, still in her clothes. Mickey took a shit and a long, hot shower. He watched the water roll over his gut, and he imagined the Black, muscular body he‚Äôd had earlier that day. The keto diet‚Äîhe was going to get into shape if it killed him, which it probably would.

He toweled off at the window. The view was of the front where they had parked, the deserted road and the black windows of the houses in the neighborhood beyond, probably also deserted, its citizens having migrated to the cities for any chance at work. There was a solitary lamppost with a broken globe. Its amber hue fought back a little patch of sidewalk and the front of the rental car and the motel‚Äôs steps against the overwhelming monochrome of the moon.

There was someone down there. The desk clerk was standing out in the street, shirtless, a long bottle of something dangling from his hand. _Fucking lunatic, it‚Äôs freezing_. The man took a long pull of his drink, then slowly lifted his arms to the full moon and star-filled sky and started stamping his feet. He pointed off in the distance, pointed in the other direction, and then started to stomp his feet in a circle. He stopped, took another drink, and started the circle again, faster and faster, until he tripped and face-planted on the pavement, where he remained for a long time. Then he rolled over and puked in the road before stumbling back into the motel.

‚ÄúIdiot.‚Äù Mickey climbed into bed and snuggled up to Foxy, pulling the fluffy comforter over both of them, warming his palms on the hills of her breasts. She mumbled a protest and placed her soft hands over his. Exhausted, he slept.

***

The phone on the nightstand next to him was ringing. ‚Äú_This is your 5:30 AM wakeup call_,‚Äù intoned a sharp, distant voice that, if not from Hell, could only be from a shitty motel automated alarm system. Thirty minutes later, he woke up again when his burner phone alarm started to crow like a rooster, and Foxy hit him with her pillow.

‚ÄúChrist, Mickey! What the hell _is that_?‚Äù she burrowed down into the blankets.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing, baby. Keep sleeping.‚Äù He got up to take a morning piss. His clothes were scattered on the bathroom floor. He returned to bed, and his cold hands found her skin through the maze of blankets.

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù she shrieked, pulling away from his morning touch. ‚ÄúMickey, noooo! Your fingers are icicles.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe we should warm that up.‚Äù He pressed his boner against her butt. Foxy threw the covers off her head and looked at him.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt we have to get a move on?‚Äù she asked, narrowing her gaze.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah we do,‚Äù he said and flopped back over on his side of the bed.

Her large eyes watched him for a second, then she dove under the blankets. He groaned when her soft lips touched the head of his dick, her tongue licking his tip, then slowly, with a growl deep in her throat, consumed the length of him. He was edging, almost there. He swore he could feel his load boiling in his balls when she pulled off, leaving his tingling cock cold and throbbing for more.

‚ÄúHey?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she said, getting up and heading to the toilet. He looked down at himself, fully aroused. ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù She gave a coy smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll give you something to do in the shower.‚Äù

‚ÄúI took a shower last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúTake another one.‚Äù

Mickey was halfway through washing his balls and jacking off when the curtain parted and Foxy stepped in. She let the stream wet her hair and face and stood there in the heat and rising steam of the water.

With shaking hands, he picked up the shower gel and reverently washed her in a soft lather of coconut-scented soap.

She turned around, presented her haunches, and Mickey mounted her under the shower. She moaned deep and lusty and thrust back at him. Again, he was that shredded Adonis from the gas station, and Foxy was the ebony princess with the copper braids. From within the steam and falling water, a rainbow flickered by. He was now a lean Asian with gypsum skin, and Foxy was a freesia lover, and then he was a burly bearded beast with a schlong arched down into the shaven pussy of a faint damsel, a skinny skank with upturned tits, black dyed hair, and graphitic tattoos up and down her back. And then finally, he was himself, though much, much better, the self he had always wanted to be.

Foxy panted and gyrated frantically and tightened around him as she shook and came, crying into the water, and he busted his nut deep in her‚Äîheld it there in the quivering, steaming soup of their fuck and the hot pinpricks of the shower.

‚ÄúHoly fuck! Jesus fucking Christ!‚Äù he exclaimed at last when he could breathe.

Foxy looked back at him and licked her pouty lips.

‚ÄúOh, Foxy. I think that was a sin.‚Äù He pulled back slowly and came out of her with the fear of ever being alone again. She turned and kissed him.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúWho we are when we fuck, that‚Äôs us and no one else.‚Äù

***

The lobby smelled of fresh-brewed coffee. A folding table next to the wall bore the steaming coffee pot, bottles of orange juice, and (according to a neatly printed sign) the Lewis and Clark‚Äôs signature banana bread.

Outside the glass of the front door, the world was a sea of white. The man from last night came in bundled from head to toe and carrying a snow shovel.

‚ÄúOh, holy shit,‚Äù Mickey said.

‚ÄúTold ya it was gonna snow,‚Äù the man smiled, displaying his broken teeth.

‚ÄúMickey, how are we supposed to get to Billings?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe snowplows will pass here in about ten minutes,‚Äù the man said, taking off his hat and revealing his snarled and knotted hair. The creases in his rough visage seemed even deeper this morning, and his eyes were bloodshot. ‚ÄúIf you go now, you‚Äôll get behind them. The roads will be fine. Just drive slow.‚Äù He looked at Mickey, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. Police don‚Äôt like the snow and cold, so I expect them to get a late start today. Oh, and so I don‚Äôt forget‚Ä¶‚Äù He reached behind the front desk and pulled out a guitar case. ‚ÄúWe had this old case sitting around. You can use it. Helps protect the instrument. Don‚Äôt even know where it came from, to tell the truth.‚Äù

Mickey took the case with a little more caution than he intended. He set it on the counter and opened it. His jaw dropped, and he let out an audible gasp_._

The once battered instrument rested intact; it looked sturdy. Comstock‚Äôs destruction had been mended.

‚ÄúIs this gold?‚Äù His fingers followed the veiny fissure, a river, a golden scar.

The man smiled, and Mickey noticed that his teeth were stained red with blood, and an angry, empty gap where his one gold tooth had been.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said from behind the counter with his hand out as if making a formal decree. With his other hand, he picked up a piece of paper and began to read like a schoolboy, ‚ÄúYou may turn in your key. I hope you all had a good night‚Äôs rest. Be sure to help yourself to our fabulous banana bread. Ms. Tina Ann herself made it herself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù asked Foxy.

The man grinned wide. He already looked a little drunk. He winked at Mickey. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm the weatherman.‚Äù From his flannel pocket, he produced a business card and handed it to Foxy.

She turned it over in her hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs blank.‚Äù

‚ÄúInvisible ink,‚Äù he said before a fit of coughing laughter.

‚ÄúThank you, sir,‚Äù said Mickey. He hefted the guitar case.

‚ÄúThis coffee is really good, and the banana bread is something special,‚Äù said Foxy.

‚ÄúTina Ann made it special,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúOh, then, who‚Äôs Tina Ann?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the owner.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell her I said it‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù Foxy took another bite and sipped her coffee.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôll be glad to hear that. It‚Äôs her secret recipe.‚Äù

***

The world was covered in snow three feet deep, but the BMW had been cleaned off. Mickey and Foxy waved goodbye to the bizarre man, pulled out, and headed for the interstate.

Mickey slowed on the ramp and waited for the beastly snowplows to pass two abreast. In the dim-blue morning, the world was in suspended animation.

‚ÄúHe made the snow come,‚Äù Mickey said after some time. He was driving slow, leaving ample space between the BMW and the plows. Not a cop in sight.

‚ÄúI feel it,‚Äù Foxy said.

‚ÄúFeel what?‚Äù Mickey asked.

‚ÄúThe enchantment. Do you feel it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. What does it feel like.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to explain. Just, I know when I feel it that there‚Äôs some serious enchantment going on somewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did it. He showed me the snow, and he did it. I saw him in the street last night dancing shirtless. I think this is what he was doing. A snow dance.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf he did,‚Äù Foxy said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not easy. It‚Äôs very strong. Like the one up in the valley after the concert. The hunters will feel it, too. There‚Äôll be consequences.‚Äù

‚ÄúThose bloody things will have to get through the snow first,‚Äù Mickey said and drove on, holding Foxy‚Äôs hand as they went.

To ""The Weatherman,"" if you are reading this I want you to know

you had a huge influence on my writing.

I hope you're okay

but something in my gut makes me feel that you've passed

into the great beyond.

You know, like empty music in an empty place... You told me that

You weren't doin' so well back then.

I confess, the first time we met I thought you were a madman

and you wanted to kill me, but you were just drunk

and poor

and heartbroken.

Then later we became friends

and you taught me the theory of the labyrinth,

it's tossing a rock into the water

that you are the stone

and you are the ripples, and hell

why not the water too?

And the center,

and the monster, body of man, head of beast.

And the mirror, if you dare.

And when you see it, for once in your life

you've found the goddamn direction.",1,1740712002.0,HFY,2,1.0,True

Allen Greaves had made a career out of producing films that no one cared about. He started out with dreams of grandeur, of directing epics that would stand the test of time. Instead, his name was synonymous with straight-to-video sci-fi trash. Rubber-suited aliens, wooden actors, dialogue so bad it was almost poetic in its absurdity‚Äîthese were his trademarks.

He wasn‚Äôt proud of it, but he had made peace with it. Movies were his passion, even if they weren‚Äôt masterpieces. Occasionally, one would turn a profit, enough to keep the lights on and buy him a little more time before he inevitably had to scrounge up funding for the next one.

Tonight, however, was different.

Allen sat alone in his dimly lit editing room, his fingers stained with cheap coffee. His latest film, *Voidwalkers*, was nearly complete, a jumbled mess of cosmic horror and neon-lit space stations. He had spent hours scrubbing through the footage, meticulously analyzing every shot. He was, if nothing else, a perfectionist.

Then he saw it.

A flicker, too fast for the eye to register.

His brows furrowed as he rewound the footage, slowing it down frame by frame. When he finally landed on the anomaly, his breath caught in his throat.

It was a single frame.

Not of the film, not of the rubbery tentacle monsters or his lead actress struggling through an overwrought monologue.

It was a picture of his childhood home.

A perfect, high-resolution image of the tiny, two-story house in Maplewood, a place he had not seen in decades. The cracked pavement in the driveway, the rusting swing set in the yard‚Äîit was all there, frozen in exquisite detail.

For a long moment, he simply stared.

This had to be some kind of joke. A prank by one of the editors? But why? No one was ever going to watch the film like this, frame by frame. Even if they did, the frame lasted for less than a fraction of a second‚Äîtoo fast for the audience to even subconsciously register.

Allen sat back in his chair, rubbing his temples. Maybe he was imagining things. He replayed the footage again. The film rolled at normal speed, and the anomaly vanished into the blur of movement.

Shaking his head, he dismissed it. He was exhausted. His mind was playing tricks on him.

But he couldn‚Äôt let it go.

# More Than a Mistake

The next night, he went back into the footage. He told himself it was just curiosity, nothing more. A meaningless aberration in an otherwise forgettable film.

But it wasn‚Äôt just one frame.

He found another.

Then another.

Each frame captured a different image from his past. The cracked linoleum kitchen floor where he had once spilled a bowl of cereal. His childhood bedroom, with its spaceship wallpaper peeling at the corners. The old church on the hill where his mother had dragged him on Sundays.

And each frame was sharper than the last. The details were impossibly crisp, clearer than any photograph he had ever seen. It was as if someone had ripped these images straight from his memory and printed them onto the celluloid.

But what unsettled him most was that every image was tied to something painful.

The swing set in the yard‚Äîwhere he had broken his arm after his drunken father shoved him too hard.  
The cracked kitchen floor‚Äîwhere his mother had thrown a plate in frustration during one of their countless screaming matches.  
The church‚Äîwhere he had begged for help, for some divine intervention that never came.

Allen‚Äôs stomach twisted.

This wasn‚Äôt a prank.

This was something else.

# The Descent

Days passed, and Allen grew obsessed.

He pored over every second of the footage, finding more and more frames. They were scattered throughout the film, buried like secrets, each one surfacing for the briefest moment before vanishing into the noise.

The deeper he looked, the worse it got.

One frame showed his father‚Äôs workbench in the garage‚Äîthe place where he had hidden when the shouting got too loud.  
Another showed the abandoned train tracks behind his house‚Äîwhere he had seen a man die when he was ten years old.

Then came the one that stopped him cold.

It was a picture of his childhood self.

Not a memory. Not a place.

Him.

A boy of about six, standing in the middle of his old bedroom. He was staring directly at the camera.

No.

Not at the camera.

At *him*.

Allen‚Äôs breath came in shallow gasps. His hands trembled.

This was impossible. He had never been photographed like this. The angle, the expression‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt something that should exist.

He slammed his laptop shut and stumbled away from his desk. His heart was hammering against his ribs.

This wasn‚Äôt just an anomaly in the footage.

This was something watching him.

# The Final Frame

For three days, he tried to ignore it. He went about his business, made small edits to the film, tried to convince himself he was losing his mind.

But then the nightmares started.

Memories he had buried long ago came surging back. His father‚Äôs heavy footsteps in the hall. The sickly sweet smell of alcohol. The cold touch of night air as he fled the house, hiding in the woods until dawn.

And always, in his dreams, the flickering images. The frames, burned into his subconscious.

Finally, he broke.

He went back to the film, one last time.

He scrubbed through the footage, his fingers slick with sweat. His stomach churned.

There‚Äînear the very end of the film.

Another frame.

He clicked on it.

This time, it wasn‚Äôt a picture from his past.

It was of his editing room.

The very room he was sitting in.

And in the corner of the frame‚Äîbarely visible, a shadow just beyond the glow of the monitor‚Äî

Something was standing there.

Watching him.

Allen turned slowly.

The room was empty.

But he felt it.

Something was there.

His pulse roared in his ears. He reached for the power button, ready to shut everything down, to erase the footage, to burn it all if he had to.

Then the screen flickered.

A new frame appeared.

It was of him.

Right now.

Sitting at his desk.

His hands frozen over the keyboard.

His mouth open in silent horror.

And behind him‚Äî

A figure.

Something tall, its face stretched and indistinct, like a smear in reality.

Allen shot up from his chair, knocking it over. He turned wildly, but there was nothing.

Nothing at all.

The screen went black.

And a final message appeared, typed out in white against the void.

**""You shouldn‚Äôt have looked.""**

Then‚Äî

The power cut out.

The only sound in the dark room was Allen‚Äôs own shallow breathing.

He never touched the footage again.

And he never, ever watched a movie frame by frame.

It was a snowy Wednesday morning, and I was already losing in life. Woke up late. Rushed out the door. Hair lookin‚Äô like I lost a fight with my pillow. You know, one of those mornings.

But listen, if I‚Äôm already late, what‚Äôs another ten minutes? I NEEDED coffee. Not ‚Äúwanted‚Äù coffee. Needed it. Like, the way a t√≠a needs chisme. It‚Äôs survival.

So, I roll up to Wawa, shuffle inside, and start fixin‚Äô my coffee when‚Äîhold up. Who is THAT?

I couldn‚Äôt see his face because he had a hat on, but I just knew. You ever feel a man‚Äôs presence before you even see his face? Like, the air changes. The vibe shifts. And TikTok had already planted the seed‚ÄîI‚Äôd been conditioned to notice white boys with Riley Green mustaches. And this man? Ohhh, this man was walking proof that the algorithm was working against me.

We didn‚Äôt have these kinds of men back in Arlington. But out here? These blue-collar hotties are just walkin‚Äô around like straight-up weapons. Like‚Äîsir, what is this witchcraft?

Anyway, I‚Äôm minding my business‚Äîbeing my awkward little self‚Äîwhen this man comes in and heads straight for the coffee. Okay. Fine. Normal. But THEN, I go to grab a donut, and this Wawa employee is standing in my way. So, I hit her with a polite, ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù because my mama raised me right.

But when she looks up at me? Her eyes go WIDE. Like, ‚ÄúYou-just-won-the-lottery‚Äù wide. Like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre-on-live-TV‚Äù wide. Her whole jaw dropped.
And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúWhat in the novela is happening right now?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt even have to turn around to know. I know this fine-looking gringo is RIGHT. BEHIND. ME. Probably had to slam on his brakes to keep from plowing into me. Like, boop‚Äîsorry, sir, did I just cause a traffic jam in the Wawa bakery section?

Now, I don‚Äôt know what it looked like from his perspective, but in my head? The scene was cinematic. Like, slow motion. Like, he walked in, saw me, and thought, I need to be wherever she is‚Ä¶

But me? Internally PANICKING. I had two voices in my head. One was like, ‚ÄúSay something! Flirt! Make a joke!‚Äù And the other was like, ‚ÄúBitch, SHUT UP. You already maxed out your embarrassment quota for the day. Just get your donut and GO.‚Äù

And then‚Äîbecause the universe loves chaos‚Äîcan we talk about how this ONLY happens when I look like I just escaped from a house fire? Why is it that when I actually put effort into my hair and outfit, the only people I run into are sweet grandmas and the guy trying to sign me up for a credit card at Costco? But the second I step out looking like I lost a bet, BOOM‚Äîfirefighter hottie, aisle three. 

Oh, did I mention? Yeah. He had an FD sweatshirt on. Firefighter? EMT? Either way, sir, if I fake choke right now, will you save me or just linger in my energy and try to get a whiff of my hair like you did in the bakery section?

Anyway, I grabbed my donut and got the hell out of there before I could embarrass myself further. But now? Now I‚Äôm wondering what his version of the story is. Like, did he go back to the fire station and tell his buddies, ‚ÄúBro, I almost died at Wawa today. There was this girl. Her hair smelled heavenly. I forgot how to function and I almost hit it from behind.‚Äù

I‚Äôll never know. But if I ever run into him again, at least I‚Äôll be prepared. And by prepared, I mean I‚Äôll still probably panic and run away like a fool.

The end. Or is it?

1izy0b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1izy0b7/chains_chains_chains_or_how_to_visit_japan_on_a/,"Chains, Chains, Chains (Or, How To Visit Japan On A Shoestring Budget) Part I: The Restaurants","**What?! Why would I want to go to Japan just to visit a bunch of chain restaurants/stores/hotels?**

The experience most of us want to have when we're visiting an exotic place is usually the most authentic experience possible. The problem is, almost everyone else is also looking for the most authentic experience possible, and that ""authentic"" experience often amounts to a handful of places that have experienced heavy overtourism from TikTok and Instagram influencers. And more often than not, that experience is not going to be as authentic as you expect.

So you can spend hours of your trip waiting in line (hours that you could be spending visiting all the numerous sights there are to see in Japan), to rush through your meal in a place that's hot and crowded, for a meal that might be 10-20% better than what you can find somewhere else around the corner. Or you can take a chance and check out the random place around the corner that has much fewer reviews and have a much better experience with none of the wait.

The problem is, not everyone wants to risk taking a chance on something they're not familiar with, or can't research. Being in an unfamiliar place can be scary sometimes, and many of the chains in Japan are everywhere, reliable, often open late, and (more often than not) pretty damn good. 

They're also great when you're on a tight budget or solo traveling because they're usually very cheap, and many have computer based ordering systems where you don't have to worry about the language barrier (some often require no interaction with staff at all) and there are often pictures everywhere to help you. 

All that being said, here are a list of many different chain restaurants for people on a budget. Part II will include chain hotels, stores (including konbinis), and some overall travel tips. I've also included some notes as well as which of these chains I enjoyed the most (which are shown in bold). If there are any chains I missed, please let me know in the comments as well.

**THE RESTAURANTS**

**Gyudon (Beef Bowls):**

1. **Matsuya (24h)**
2. Sukiya (24h)
3. Yoshinoya (24h)

Gyudon restaurants are everywhere in Japan, and the big 3 chains are open 24/7 which makes them great for late night and great for breakfast. You can typically add things like poached eggs, scallions, and/or curry sauce to your beef bowl as well. The consensus regarding the Gyudon chains seem to be that you get what you pay for, but this wasn't my experience at all, and my favorite restaurant of the 3 was also the cheapest, Matsuya. The beef bowls are fantastic, there are lots of condiments available, and it only costs about 500 yen (~$3) including miso soup. And they have Coke for 100 yen (whereas Sukiya only has unsweetened tea and coffee).

**Revolving/Conveyor Belt Sushi:**

1. **Uobei**
2. Hama Sushi
3. Sushiro
4. Kura

Having been to many high end sushi places on my trip, I will say this: do not underestimate the quality of conveyor belt sushi. Is high end sushi typically going to be a better experience? Yes, in most cases it will be. But compared to the better sushi chains on this list, for the vast majority of people reading this (unless you have a very discerning palate), your actual experience may be around 20-30% better, but you will probably pay around 200-1000% the price for that experience. 

Chains like Uobei and Sushiro will often deliver very high quality (often in season and regional) sushi for 100-300 yen per plate. The top 3 options on this list were all fantastic quality for the price, however I was less than impressed with my experiences with Kura where the fish was often almost frozen, the rice cold, and it seemed to fall apart quite easily (like the freezing fish was just thrown on top of a ball of rice). Uobei, Hama, and Sushiro were more often than not fantastic, and you'll be able to get a whole lot of bang for your buck for around 2000 yen or less.

**Ramen:**

1. **Hakata Furyu**
2. Ichiran
3. Ippudo
4. Ramen Jiro
5. Mouko Tanmen Nakamoto
6. Fukushin
7. Hidakaya

There are no shortage of great ramen restaurants that are inexpensive, chain or not. However there are many ramen chains that are cheap and reliable, and often without the huge lines (with the exception of Ichiran, but there are also lots of locations and choosing off hours can often get you there without any wait at all). As a tonkotsu lover, my favorite of the bunch was Hakata Furyu, which had the richest, creamiest tonkotsu broth I've ever had. Ichiran is everywhere, often open 24/7, and is consistently very decent for tonkotsu style broth even though people like to hate on it. Special mention on this list is Jiro which is all around a very delicious and very unique style of ramen - **do your research before you visit a Jiro location**. It is very cheap and absolutely delicious, but it is a lot of food and you will be expected to finish all of it fairly quickly.

**Family/Western Restaurants:**

1. Saizeriya
2. Royal Host
3. Denny's
4. Jonathan's
5. Big Boy
6. Cafe Gusto

Family restaurants can be found practically everywhere. I haven't had much experience with most of these, but did eat at Saizeriya which was incredibly cheap, and the food was...decent. These restaurants are pretty reliable and inexpensive for western style diner type options. Many offer free soft drink and coffee refills as well which can be quite popular.

**Burgers:**

1. **Mos Burger**
2. McDonald's
3. Burger King
4. Wendy's First Kitchen

Limited experience with burgers, but I will mention that the McDonald's menu in Japan really isn't all that interesting, and you'll likely get a much better burger and experience at Mos Burger which is everywhere and is very good.

**Pizza:**

1. Shakey's
2. Saizeriya
3. Cona
4. Dominos
5. Pizza Hut

While I haven't been to either, Shakey's is a well rated pizza buffet chain, and Cona is a pizza restaurant and bar where all drinks and all pizzas cost 500 yen, and the pizza is supposed to be great for the price. Saizeriya has several pizzas for less than 500 yen.

**Yakitori:**

1. **Torikizoku**
2. Yakitori Center
3. Toriyoshi

Cheap yakitori can be found in most places where there are bars, but many will have seating fees, some will have menus entirely in Japanese or staff that does not speak English, and a few may not even allow foreigners entirely. I've had several very good experiences at Torikizoku. The menu is simple - everything costs 370 yen (yakitori comes in sets of 2 skewers), there are no seating fees, and you can order everything via ipad. It's a good value, and the drinks and yakitori are cheap and delicious.

**Izakayas:**

1. Hanbey
2. Isomaru Suisan
3. Ramuchan
4. Teke Teke
5. Toriyoshi Shoten

*Community Additions:*

1. Tori Mero
2. Miraizaka

Izakayas often have Japanese menus (sometimes handwritten), a language barrier issue, and often clientele which are regular locals, all of which can be pretty daunting for a first timer. Chain izakayas can be a solid option for tourists to get their foot in the door without worrying too much about whether or not they will be welcome. An overall cheap, reliable izakaya with a fun atmosphere is Hanbey which has a retro Showa theme, and many very cheap and delicious options. 

Also, be aware: **nearly all izakayas have seating fees (unless they are a standing bar)**. I've seen so many tourists complain that they received an appetizer that they thought would be free but they were charged for it, but this is standard for every izakaya and everyone pays it including locals. Keep in mind that they also don't tip in Japan and you're still eating and drinking for very cheap at many of these places. And you're also getting something in return for this seating fee (which is rarely more than 500 yen/person).

**Yakiniku:**

1. **Yakiniku Like**
2. Ramuchan

There are probably more yakiniku chains that I am missing here, but you order raw meat here (usually beef) and grill it yourself at your own table. Yakiniku Like is cheap and reliable, and is great for solo diners as they have solo booths. Some locations also offer decent quality wagyu beef for relatively cheap.

**Tonkatsu:**

1. Tonkatsu Matsunoya
2. Katsuya

It's pretty hard to go wrong with deep fried pork at just about any hour. Matsunoya has locations that are open very late or even 24h.

**Curry:**

1. **Coco Ichibanya**
2. Go!Go!CURRY

Japanese curry is always delicious for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, though most of the curry shops don't open until 11am (the gyudon chains and Nakau however are all open 24/7 and do have some curry dishes if you're craving curry for breakfast).

**Udon:**

1. **Marugame Seimen**
2. Nakau (24h)
3. Hanamaru Udon

Marugame Seimen was my favorite chain for cheap udon, but the udon at Nakau (which is also pretty much everywhere) is more than serviceable, and available 24 hours a day.

**Soba:**

1. Fuji Soba
2. Kasugatei (Aburasoba)

*Community Additions:*

1. Komoro Soba

The 2 soba places on this list are very different. Fuji Soba has very cheap traditional style soba, whereas Kasugatei has Aburasoba which is a dry brothless soba style. If anyone has any other soba chains please let me know.

**Chain Sushi**

1. Sushi Zanmai
2. Uogashi Nihon-Ichi

These sushi options are slightly more expensive than the kaitenzushi places I listed above, but have very decent quality sushi for the price. Uogashi is a standing sushi restaurant, whereas Sushi Zanmai is a sit down restaurant.

**Hamburger Steaks:**

1. Bikkuri Donkey
2. Tsubame Grill

Hamburger steak (like salisbury steak) is quite popular in Japan, and you can find many varieties of it at Bikkuri Donkey if you're craving it, which is located all over Japan.

**Gyoza:**

1. Osaka Ohsho
2. Gyoza No Osho
3. Hidakaya

Gyoza is the perfect drunk food, it's cheap, delicious, and easy to find. All 3 of these options also offer many chinese dishes and very inexpensive ramen as well.

**Tempura:**

1. Tendon Tenya
2. Marugame Seimen

Tempura can be very comforting and there's a couple decent chains in Japan that I know of. Tendon Tenya serves tempura rice bowls, and Marugame Seimen specializes in udon and tempura.

**Donuts/Bakeries:**

1. **Mister Donut**
2. Krispy Kreme
3. Vie de France
4. Manneken

Misdo will always be the king of donuts for me. They're everywhere, have amazing options, and surprisingly are not that sweet. If you are craving Krispy Kreme, they have em in Japan too. Vie de France is a bakery chain that is all over the place, and has all kinds of sweet and savory pastries. Manneken is the go to spot for Belgian-style waffles.

**Set Meals (Teishoku):**

1. Yayoiken
2. Shinpachi Shokudo

*Community Additions:*

1. Ootoya

Both Yayoiken and Shinpachi can be found pretty much everywhere, and serve a very wide range of traditional japanese dishes (with many different components). If you're looking for a traditional Japanese meal on the cheap, these are your best bets.

**Tsukemen:**

*Community Additions:*

1. Tsujita

**Bars:**

1. **Osakenobijutsukan (Bar Liquor Museum)**
2. Bar Moon Walk
3. The Public Stand
4. The Hub

Bar chains in Japan are surprisingly awesome, and the ones I've listed here are cheap and a whole lot of fun. My favorite of the bunch is called Bar Liquor Museum, and they are everywhere. They have an enormous list of unique spirits from all over the world at VERY good prices, the bartenders are friendly, and here's the best part: several of them are located **inside convenience stores** like Lawson and Daily Yamazaki, and will offer whiskey that pairs with Lawson Karaage, and in addition to being able to buy and eat anything from the convenience store, they will also smoke anything you buy in the store for around 300 yen (potato chips, fried chicken, onigiri). It's an absolute blast, and I had a great time at this chain.

If you're looking to drink a lot for very very cheap, Bar Moon Walk offers every drink on the menu for 250 yen, and The Public Stand offers all you can drink plans that are incredibly cost effective. Meanwhile, if you're just looking for a foreigner friendly bar with a decent beer selection and reasonable prices, you'll find The Hub in most places you go.

**What's next:**

If you made it this far and are wondering why I didn't mention konbinis at all, the next post will go over hotel chains and internet cafes, souvenir shopping, convenience stores, and grocery stores, as well as some overall tips that I found useful as a solo traveler on a tight budget.

1izxzcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1izxzcb/i_have_a_rant_and_i_dont_know_where_to_share_im/,I have a rant and I don't know where to share - I'm tired of people postulizing that scientists/doctors are *evil*,"Okay, I'm not trying to start a fight guys. 

We are living in an age with so much access to information. The last century and especially the last few decades there has been so much scientific research published and besides sometimes pay walls we have access to all this scientific literature. 

With social media thrown in we are seeing the rise of influencers trying to showcase all of this ""new"" information or ""secrets"" that we are being ""lied to about"". 

Okay here is the core of my rant - I think it is more positive than negative that we have access to information rather than having it be unaccessible. We should feel like we play a role in our decision making. That is a great advance in society. 

*However* just because you have the ability to research something and it doesn't align with something your doctor tells you .... *It doesn't mean your doctor is an evil manipulative monster that wants you to suffer*

Like holy shit. We are turning whole groups of people, scientists and doctors, who overwhelming choose these fields because some part of them wants to contribute to the overall wellness of society, into evil players. They want to do something outside of their own benefit. I don't believe in altruism, but people choosing fields where the care for people certainly shows a high level of compassion for others (usually not always there are outliers everywhere). 

For example I'm not even pregnant right now or do I currently have kids. But for whatever reason I see a lot of videos about these topics on Instagram (hello algorithm meet my subconscious desires). But so many videos are of women saying how terrible these doctors are because they showed pushback with some of the desires of the mother. Inductions, vitamin k, ultrasounds, etc all of the above. These women are framing it so it looks like the doctors are evil and manipulative and acting for some larger force that's meant to oppress women and keep society from having healthy people. 


But it is clearly not that??? Like these people are trained to a standard of care. At the end of the day their job revolves around that. They can't say otherwise because they don't know for a fact that whatever essential oil you are using will cure your cold or that red light will heal a wound. There isn't scientific research so they can't tell you to use it. And say for example it's true that red light kill wounds, well unfortunately the system of rigorous scientific research takes time. But maybe one day your doctor will prescribe red light therapy instead of antibiotics. But until then the information that they give you is the best, and as a far as the science knows it is the best way to heal your ailments. 

Same goes with like, white sliced bread. Okay so we do know now that processed foods are unhealthy. I think that is now proven. The fillers, the processed flour, excess sugar, etc. BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN THAT THE CREATORS OF WHITE SLICED BREAD WERE EVIL! Like, we just needed a way to feed all the kids people were having? They wanted kids to get adequate calories? Know we know a little more. Plain white bread isn't the healthiest choice. But it meant a lot of kids in the 50s got breakfast lunch and dinner.

1izxwtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1izxwtz/m22_severe_ongoing_arm_pain_and_fatigue/,M22 Severe ongoing arm pain and fatigue,"22 year old male here. Around 5'6"", ~120 pounds. A past doctor briefly mentioned possible tachycardia but seemed to pass it off as normal anxiety. Family history of high blood pressure. No pre-existing known health conditions. CBC and thyroid tests were done and came back OK.

I have been having ongoing arm pain for at least two years now. It only affects my left arm and I don't mean to be a hypochondriac but it happens to me everyday. I will wake up with no arm pain and as I am getting ready for work, my arm pain will slowly surface. It will come and go but the more I type and move around in the office the more it aches. Crazy thing is my left arm is mostly stationary because of the way I use a keyboard that my right arm is actually the one doing all the movement. I will momentarily have weakness in the hand associated with my left arm and will struggle to open and grab things. And I cannot pinpoint where it is exactly aching it's like I feel it all over. I can be cleaning my room, putting up clothes or doing something as simple as making something quick to eat and I will feel it. So I realized I haven't been to the doctor in a while and  I needed a new one. The basics such as my weight and height were recorded but then when the doctor came I explained to him every symptom I had and especially my arm. He took my heartbeat and recognized it was high but told me it's anxiety. Wasn't going to argue with him on that because that is very possible. He took my blood pressure and also acknowledged it was high but again attributed it to anxiety. When I explained my arm pain to the point where I'm literally wincing and groaning and needing to take multiple OTC pills a day just so I can get some kind of relief and it wears off fast! He told me the arm pain is normal and is anxiety. I've been dealing with my arm pain for close to 2 years and I am in pain and I don't want to overreact or tell a doctor he is wrong. But I can usually feel when I am anxious. My arm hurts in the comfort of my own house, alone. I am not sure what I'd be anxious about at that time. 

I also have really bad fatigue that has been happening around the same time as the arm pain. I'll get 7-8 hours of sleep and I wake up tired. I'll go through the day thinking maybe I'll feel more awake later and I get worse. Coffee, soda with no caffeine (I thought the sugar would've helped) and caffeine, and especially all energy drinks makes me feel incapacitated and almost like I'm drunk. I can't get more than 8 hours of sleep during a weekday. But my head will start dropping and I'll start slurring my words to where I'm having to cut myself off from speaking halfway through the day because I physically can't form sentences anymore. I can speak just fine and I'm literate in the morning but then it all goes downhill and I'm struggling to pronounce words I know. I then will be walking and it's like some weird kind of out-of-body experience where I don't remember where I am. And I'll have involuntarily movements and it just feels like everything gets dizzy. And so I'm chugging as much water as I can but my bladder got a whole lot smaller and it's like the water just comes right out me and I'm not dehydrated that's for sure, I then grab a snack and even would try eating a few pieces of candy to try and help but for brief moments it will go dark for me and I'll come back to time passing but I won't remember what happened or where I went. It's like I black out? It happens every day and the less sleep the worse but the more sleep doesn't get rid of it. I sleep a good amount on the weekends but then don't have energy to do anything because once I start I then start to feel that out-of-body experience again where I don't remember why I was doing what I was doing and when I got inside my room or where I am. I feel like I'm living inside my head at this point and I feel so incapable of doing anything and it's horrible man. And my doctor just keeps saying it's just anxiety and it's just in my head but I honestly feel like something's really wrong and I don't feel I'm being listened to. I have currently been in the same place on the floor for an hour cause even though I want to get up it's like my brain is telling me I can't move. So I'll waste hours sometimes just stuck in one place because I feel I can't move when I'm capable of doing so. I am not in a depressed state. I'm just frustrated.

Does this sound like anxiety or should I get a second opinion. I do admit I'm a little anxious about this because it hasn't been resolved for me and I'm afraid if I don't find a reason I'd have to accept this as my normal. I want my life back. I want my energy back. ",1,1740711671.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications.

1izxv14,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1izxv14/married_sugar_daddy_fell_in_love_advice_needed/,Married sugar daddy fell in love... advice needed please,"Hi everyone... I need advice. Sorry for the novel.

I (27F) have been seeing my sugar daddy (50M) for 5 months now. We met on Seeking and he was my first arrangement, I didn't know much about the lifestyle prior to it. 
I should add, I had my reservations about seeing anybody who was married, which he knew about (please no rude comments). I'm on an allowance per month. He asked for exclusivity and I have not seen anyone else in this time.

   He has become very emotionally attached to me and I don't know what to do. He is constantly telling me how much he loves me, and how he wants to be with me in the long run. We text on a daily basis, which seemed okay in the beginning but it got to the point where he was sending novels about his feelings and selfies every single day (I had to tell him recently to tone this down with the pics). 
 I do care for him and his wellbeing and said in the past that if circumstances were different then MAYBE there could be something (unsure about this now). 

I feel like he has been a bit demanding with my time, wanting to call at random times, hinting around about wanting to see me more often than arranged (I respectfully mentioned my allowance and there was no initiative for any increase on his part). Sometimes we will go for drives or grab a coffee outside of the 1x/week I see him. We also went on a 3 day overnight together last month. 

 I told him that his plans to divorce his wife (20+ year marriage, dead bedroom situation) should be for HIM and his happiness, and nothing to do with me. I do not want any part in being a homewrecker or having the expectation that I will be in a LTR with him afterward... 
I have had numerous talks with him about boundaries and how I am somebody who naturally needs alone time. That I am feeling suffocated and his behaviour is frankly turning me off and making me want to run.. I do care for him but this is becoming a lot for me. Right afterward, he made a joke about me becoming a step mother to his 3 children (2 adults, 1 teen) so I'm not sure how seriously he is taking what I'm saying. I have literally suggested that perhaps he is feeling NRE, some kind of limerance or lust. He insists he loves me and wants to run off into the sunset...

I don't want to hurt his feelings as I do care about him, however, this IS an arrangement, which I have had to remind him of. I don't know if I should end things or what to do.

Does anyone have any advice or gone through anything similar? Thanks guys.",1,1740711519.0,sugarlifestyleforum,9,1.0,False
1izxuz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PassNclex/comments/1izxuz5/my_nclexrn_journey_passed_in_8687_questions_with/,My NCLEX-RN Journey: Passed in 86/87 Questions with a huge knowledge gap,"I graduated a long time ago and recently decided to take the NCLEX-RN after reinstating my RPN license. With less than a month to review‚Äîwhile working full-time and taking care of my kids‚Äîit was a challenge. Nursing practice has evolved so much since I last studied, and I quickly realized I had a huge knowledge gap. But I gave it a try, went on hiatus from everything else, and reviewed as much as I could. Most of my studying happened at night when my kids were asleep, or I would listen to audio and YouTube videos while multitasking. My review was effort on steroids, lol.

Given how much I had to catch up on, I felt a sense of urgency to grasp as much knowledge as possible in the limited time I had.

The Day Before the Exam

I decided to sleep early at 9:30 PM instead of staying up until 1-2 AM like I usually did. But because of nerves, I couldn‚Äôt sleep well. My test center was a bit far, so we left early, and I arrived at 10:30 AM. Thankfully, they allowed me to start right away, even though my scheduled time was 12 PM.

I was too anxious to eat much‚Äîjust coffee and a sausage, no carbs. When I started the exam, I was shocked that the first 10 questions were easier than I expected. But soon, I started feeling extremely hungry, like I was getting hypoglycemic. My brain must have anticipated the mental marathon ahead. I took a quick break, and thank God I had brought a can of Pepsi, chocolates, and another sausage. My mistake was not bringing crackers, because halfway through, I got hungry again.

After a washroom break, I went back in. The first 15-20 questions were still manageable, but then things got confusing. Case studies started appearing, and the NGN-style questions took up a lot of time. I was extra careful with those, but they were so time-consuming. I also had some very easy questions‚Äîones even non-nurses could answer‚Äîbut I still got them wrong (I checked after). Toward the end, the questions became ridiculously hard and weird. At that point, I was just guessing. Hahaha.

My exam shut off at 86 or 87 questions, and I felt like crying. All I could think about were the sure mistakes I had made‚Äîand there were a lot of them.

Post-NCLEX Syndrome & The Wait

I had no idea about post-NCLEX syndrome, but as soon as I got into the car, it hit me. I had a massive headache and felt like throwing up. Thankfully, my husband was driving. The whole ride home, I obsessively scrolled through Reddit, reading posts about NCLEX results and the odds of passing or failing.

If you‚Äôve been there, you know the obsession‚Äîchecking emails, Pearson Vue, and the state board website over and over. I applied in New York, which I read takes longer to post results. I didn‚Äôt do the Pearson Vue Trick (PVT) because I didn‚Äôt want to fool myself with something that‚Äôs not 100% accurate.

After 48 hours, I finally checked my results. It was my 40th birthday. Sitting in the parking lot after work, I opened my Pearson account‚Äîand it said ‚ÄúPASS.‚Äù I cried like a baby, like someone had died, like a cow. Best birthday ever.

My Study Resources & Recommendations

For those looking for resources, here‚Äôs what worked for me:
	‚Ä¢	Dr. Sharon (Klimek Review on YouTube) ‚Äì Watch ALL her videos. She teaches how to analyze and break down questions so that even if you don‚Äôt know the answer, you can make an educated guess.
	
https://youtube.com/@klimekreviews?si=nL_U-FWmhr9VqfaM

‚Ä¢	Mark Klimek (Prioritization Lectures 1-12) ‚Äì Listen to everything, and use the handout that comes with it.

https://1filedownload.com/mark-klimek-lectures-1-to-12-nursing-notes/  

	‚Ä¢	Archer vs. UWorld ‚Äì I tested both and chose Archer over UWorld because Archer‚Äôs rationales are short and focus only on what you need to understand about the problem. UWorld feels like reading Wikipedia. Also, Archer‚Äôs interface is very similar to the NCLEX, and it helped me a lot with NGN-style questions. I believe learning how to answer NGN questions was a key factor in my passing, and that‚Äôs all thanks to Archer.

Final Thoughts

Without God, none of this would have been possible. I felt so down at times, but I know my abilities alone didn‚Äôt make this happen. All glory to God. Thank You, Jesus!!!

i used to have a pill problem. my mom would call the doctor and ask them to up the dosage whenever id talk back to her from 6th grade to 8th grade and up until my hospitalization freshman year of highschool tried to od a few times and would abuse all my medication. i stopped after i was hospitalized- i mean i fakes my way out of there but believe it or not doing shrooms once has had me never want to die ever again.

id still snort my hydroxizine from time to time until my senior year and j stopped getting high every day after sophmore year and now im in college.

 i was always known as the person who could make friends with a tree as a kid i was friends with everyone and until my senior year of high school id lost every friend id ever made but one bc id have outburts and not realize. junior year i was diagnosed with AuDHD (in the past it was MDD, GAD, bipolar 1, insert mood disorder etc etc etc but it turns out i was jsut built different) 

junior year i started working at my loacl ymca and i was friends with every staff member no exceptions and i never lost any of them. i would go to school from 7:41-9:30 in the morning 2 ap classes and 4 dual enrollment and spend the bulk of my time at coffee shops and feeling like the real me no exceptions

april of 2024  year i went to a party like two hours away with a friend of mine and a few of her friends and they kinda excluded me but it was what i imagined colelge would be like- i had so many randoma nd interesting conversations with strangers and itw as what i imagined college would be like

i was on 20mg of jornay pm methylphenidate at the time- but i thought it could get better with more drugs

end of april it went up to 60mg and its when i didnt realize but i started to loose a bit of myself- became a bit more socially anxious and reserved and had disassociate episodes from time to time

i went to college and it went up to 80mg. and i got 10mg of regular methylphenidate as a late day booster dose

ive lost myself. i have to sit in the back corner of the bus because its my spot and ill cry if i dont (i forced myself to stop doing taht a few days ago) and i dont like talking to people or going out and i put things off even more than i used to and i used to have so muhc radical optimism and now im so pessimistic and any positivity feels fake. im lucky if i eat one meal a day and i blame it on the schoolwork but i just dont feel hungry or make the time

i thought it was my demanding program but i realized the other night that its more than that.

that me being on such a high dose wasnt for effectiveness- it was because im still seeking the best high- the most drugs- and a stimulant? thats a real drug right there. i snort the booster dose bc its the only way ill be affected by the meds like a neurotypical person- get cracked out and motivated when i need to

but i hadnt done that in years. and i feel like its not just how much work i have to do that i quit every club i joined or havent made any friends- its because i lost my sparkle

i havent gotten better and i didnt even notice i was poisoning myself

but for how demanding the workload is here im worried if i go down 20-40mg now and not in the summer the withdrawl will fuck with my ability to perform because god is it hard here 

and when i miss one dose im immoble for the whole day

1izxrko,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1izxrko/vernon_part_2/,"""Vernon"" Part 2","<><><><><>



The night Vernon took over is a blur. I remember it like it was yesterday.



I was watching a rerun of ‚ÄúThe Brady Bunch‚Äù when my mom sashays into the house holding hands with this giant black dude. As I told you, my ma had been talking about this Vernon guy for some time, but it was still a huge surprise when he comes barging in like that. He plops down next to me on the couch, puts his feet on the coffee table and snaps his fingers.



‚ÄúBring me a beer, bitch,‚Äù he says.



Mom just squeals and hops to it, and as she pushes past my twin sisters on her way to the kitchen, she says, ‚Äúisn‚Äôt he just so AWESOME?‚Äù



From the looks on my sisters‚Äô faces and their giggles, they agreed with Mom.



Vernon noticed, and he immediately starts making his move. He says, ‚ÄúDamn, you two, get over here ‚Äî don‚Äôt hide your pretty little selves over there by the stairway.‚Äù



Megan and Emily literally ran toward the couch all googly-eyed. When they get within arm‚Äôs length, Vernon leans forward and starts squeezing both their asses and rubbing their pussies through their pants.



‚ÄúDa-yum, you two look good,‚Äù he says. I could see my sisters turning to Jell-O. 



Then, Vernon glares at me and says, ‚ÄúGet the fuck off this goddamn couch when I‚Äôm sitting here, white boy.‚Äù 



Of course, I jumped to my feet ‚Äî I‚Äôm scared to death at this point, as you can imagine. Vernon turns back to my sisters and tells them to show their tits. Without even thinking about it ‚Äî and I mean no hesitation whatsoever ‚Äî they both lifted their shirts and bras, and started cupping their boobs toward Vernon, like they‚Äôre trying to turn him on. My mom comes back with Vernon‚Äôs beer and serves it to him, and he tells her he wants to see her suck her daughters‚Äô tits. And she does it! Again, without a second‚Äôs hesitation. 



Dude, I can‚Äôt explain it ‚Äî that‚Äôs the effect Vernon had on women; they just melted. I‚Äôm telling you: He fucking hypnotized them, man ‚Äî how else do you think he was able to talk all those women, not just my mom and sisters, into selling their bodies and giving him every dime? You‚Äôll probably never understand, but within five minutes, he‚Äôd have women completely eating out of his hand. Not even five minutes. Some people just have that power ‚Äî and Vernon had it, big-time.



So, yeah, it was fucking crazy, man ‚Äî I‚Äôm standing there with my mouth hanging open, too scared to move, watching my mom suck my sisters‚Äô boobs while this huge Black guy is chilling on my couch rubbing his dick through his pants. I felt like I was on a merry-go-round that was spinning at, like, triple speed.



Then, all of a sudden, Tommy and my dad come running in from the garage carrying tire-irons, and for a second, I thought I was about to be rescued. Yeah, right ‚Äî as if they stood a chance against Vernon.



My dad says, ‚ÄúGet the fuck out of my house!‚Äù



Vernon somehow managed to whip out a big silver pistol from his waistband; I still can‚Äôt believe how fast his hand moved. He yells, ‚ÄúDrop that shit, motherfuckers.‚Äù



My dad and brother dropped the tire-irons; I remember the clanging sound they made when they hit the kitchen floor. I glanced over at my mom and sisters ‚Äî they looked as shocked as I was, but they were smiling. Yes, I swear to gawd, they were fucking smiling, dude, like this was all some big thrill. Meanwhile, my sisters‚Äô shirts were still scrunched up around their shoulders, and their tits were still exposed. The whole thing was fucking surreal, I‚Äôm telling you ‚Äî this Vernon guy is pointing a gun at my dad and Tommy, and they‚Äôve got their hands raised while my mom and sisters are standing there looking at Vernon all moon-eyed, with Megan and Emily‚Äôs boobs hanging out.



Vernon nods toward me and tells my sisters, ‚ÄúTake that little faggot out of here for a couple hours. Go to the store, wherever, I don‚Äôt give a fuck ‚Äî just stay gone for at least two hours.‚Äù



Megan and Emily fixed their shirts and pulled me out of the house. Megan drove us around for two hours in the car Dad had just bought for her twenty-first birthday. I begged my sisters to call the police but they told me to shut the fuck up and changed the subject to how awesome and handsome Vernon was.



So, when the two hours were over, Megan drives home and there‚Äôs a fire truck and ambulance parked outside. Mom comes running out of the house with the fakest crocodile tears you ever saw and tells us Dad and Tommy were electrocuted while working on the fuse box. My mom and sisters pretended to be sad; I really was. I mean, it fucked me up in the head, man. I can‚Äôt tell you how much I wanted to scream at those EMTs ‚ÄòVERNON DID IT!!‚Äô but the look my mom gave me glued my mouth shut. 



Yeah, I know, I should‚Äôve said something ‚Äî but I was a kid, you know? I wanted to please my mom. The thing is, my dad and Tommy ‚Äî I loved ‚Äòem, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but they were always more macho than me, and were always busting my balls about something. So, I became kind of a mama‚Äôs boy. And I knew Mom was head-over-heels in love with this scary Vernon guy, and she‚Äôd never seemed happier, and ‚Ä¶ well, goddamn it, she gave me that look and I kept my mouth shut. I didn‚Äôt say anything. I did it for my mom, and she turned right around and betrayed me in the worst way you can imagine. All to make Vernon happy. Everything was always for Vernon.



You know how there are things in people‚Äôs lives that haunt them forever? Specific moments? Well, that‚Äôs mine. One of ‚Äòem, anyway. If only I‚Äôd have said something to those firemen and ambulance guys when they were carrying the bodies from the house ‚Äî everything would‚Äôve turned out differently. You know?



They brought my dad and brother out in body-bags with their heads covered. Megan and Emily were still pretending to be sad, but Mom had to cover her face to hide her smile.



A few hours after the authorities left, Vernon came back to our house and told us to forget about Dad and Tommy. That was easy enough for my mom and sisters ‚Äî within ten minutes there was an orgy in the living room, with me standing at attention wearing Megan‚Äôs panties on my ass and Emily‚Äôs on my face, watching through the leg holes as the three woman in my family serviced their new daddy, this dude who‚Äôd just killed all the men in our family, other than me. I can‚Äôt tell you how scared I was standing there with my sister‚Äôs panties on my head. I guess I had good reason to be scared ‚Äî because things got a hell of a lot worse.



When Vernon was finished fucking his three new bitches, he said it was my turn to get fucked. I had no say in the matter, and so I was raped for the first time while my mom and sisters laughed at me. I can tell you: it was one of the worst moments of my life ‚Äî and I‚Äôve had a lot of bad moments. 



I want you to imagine what that felt like for me ‚Äî and, mind you, this was just a few hours after my father and brother were killed. I‚Äôm bent over the arm of the couch with Emily‚Äôs panties still on my head; Vernon‚Äôs behind me about to rape me, while my naked mom and sisters are chilling on the carpet where they‚Äôd just had sex, playing with themselves and watching with their eyes glazed over. Then, Vernon shoves his cock all the way in without any regard for me whatsoever, and it‚Äôs the worst pain I‚Äôve ever felt. He starts pumping away like crazy, and he‚Äôs telling me to keep screaming because it turns him on. So, I‚Äôm in this excruciating pain, not to mention the overwhelming shame I‚Äôm feeling ‚Äî and then I look up and my mom and sisters are dying laughing at the faces I‚Äôm making, and they start teasing me about being a faggot.



It was one of those moments where you realize your whole world has changed and there‚Äôs no way you can ever go back. It‚Äôs a fucked-up thing for a eighteen-year-old kid to have to go through, but I didn‚Äôt have a choice. 



After being raped, I barely had a minute to recover before Vernon told me it was time for my daily whipping. He explained how white males had kept Blacks and women down for centuries to cover up for their own weaknesses, and how in modern society it was the role of ‚Äòwhite male swine‚Äô like me to pay reparations for those wrongdoings. Mom and the twins sat there like zombies, nodding like they were listening to the Sermon on the Mount.



Vernon finished his lecture by telling the twins to find something to beat me with. Megan came back with an extension cord and Emily had a coat hanger that she‚Äôd twisted into a whip. I was ordered to bend over and grab my ankles to get ready for my first reparations whipping. Vernon told me if I cried I‚Äôd get an extra beating ‚Äî then, he told the twins he‚Äôd fuck whichever one made me cry first, while the loser would have to wait until the next day for his big, black dick. He always did shit like that, to make sure the twins would try to outdo each other during my reparations whippings.



Vernon and my mom settled on the couch to watch the show. He held her in his arms and played with her pussy while she stared at me with the most sadistic look in her eye that you can imagine, like the fucking devil was inside her. Vernon nodded and the twins got started, taking turns slashing my ass and legs.  Oh, it was terrible, dude ‚Äî I‚Äôm lost in this huge wall of pain, and I look up at my mom and beg her to please do something to help me. She just leans her head against Vernon‚Äôs chest and laughs at me while her new boyfriend finger-fucks her and the twins continue beating the shit out of me, despite the fact that I‚Äôd done absolutely nothing wrong, other than having committed the sin of being born a white male.



Emily made me cry first, which really pissed off Megan, so she hit me even harder. By the time Vernon waved his hand to let the girls know that my beating was over, I was a fucking mess. Vernon ordered me to kiss my sisters‚Äô feet to thank them, and I was somehow able to do that before collapsing on the living room carpet. Megan was still mad that her new daddy wouldn‚Äôt be fucking her again that night, so she kicked me in the ribs as they were all leaving on the way to the bedroom. I rolled around on the floor all night in agony, crying like a baby. 



That first night was the worst, man. I remember praying for the nightmare to end soon. Little did I know it would go on forever. It‚Äôs been more than twenty years since Vernon took over my life ‚Äî so long ago, I can‚Äôt even remember what it‚Äôs like to be free.



Are you kidding? You think I‚Äôm free now? Listen, no offense, but just because Vernon‚Äôs dead, that doesn‚Äôt mean shit, dude. The man brainwashed me; don‚Äôt you understand what that means? It‚Äôs not that easy to just say ‚Äúhe‚Äôs dead, now I‚Äôm free.‚Äù You don‚Äôt think I want to be free? You don‚Äôt think I want to love myself? I can‚Äôt, man. I fucking can‚Äôt. 



It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm rotten inside, so everything outside looks rotten, too. I have to turn away whenever I see something beautiful ‚Äî you know, like a sunset or one of those really pretty butterflies. I can‚Äôt look. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt deserve to let anything beautiful inside because it‚Äôs so fucking rotten in there. I don‚Äôt know, man. It‚Äôs all fucked up, I tell you. Vernon fucked me up. Forever.



Yeah, I went to a social worker, when I applied for SSI, but ‚Ä¶ well, she was real pretty, and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to tell her any of this fucked-up stuff. I ended up lying and saying I was just having nightmares, and then I never went back.



Well, listen, it‚Äôs been nice talking to you. Thanks for letting me get all this stuff off my chest, but I should go. Well, no, I don‚Äôt have anywhere to be, but I‚Äôm broke and my check won‚Äôt get here until Tuesday. I can‚Äôt sit here without drinking. That bartender‚Äôs a dick ‚Äî he‚Äôll kick me out.



What? You sure? I don‚Äôt want to mooch. Well, okay, thanks ‚Äî I‚Äôll take another Jack straight up. I appreciate it. Well, yeah, I‚Äôve got a lot more stories to tell. Like I said, I‚Äôve never told anyone about any of this stuff before, and it feels good to vent, you know? So, if you don‚Äôt mind buying, I‚Äôll keep talking.



Great. Listen, I‚Äôve gotta go take a leak. I‚Äôll be back in a minute. 



<><><><><>



Hey, sorry about that ‚Äî my teeth were swimming. Thanks for the shot. So ‚Ä¶ what else do you want to know?



What was everyday life like as a slave? Well, it fucking sucked, dude, as you might imagine. I thought about suicide a lot, although I was too much of a coward to do it. I‚Äôm sure death would‚Äôve been better than what I went through. Every single day was messed up in one way or another ‚Äî and that‚Äôs not even counting my reparations whippings, which usually happened right after Mom got home from the bank, and before clients started arriving for the evening. 



Did I get used to it? Well, I was never really able to get into a routine, if that‚Äôs what you mean, because Vernon and my mom and sisters were always throwing new shit at me. So, I was always kept off-balance, and I never knew what was going to happen to me day-to-day ‚Äî only that it was going to be bad. I guess you could say I got used to everyone being mean to me, although that didn‚Äôt make it hurt any less, you know?



But there were routines I had to follow. There was always a ton of housework to do; that pretty much never ended because the girls and guests would constantly make messes. Vernon liked me to always be in uniform, which was a slutty maid‚Äôs outfit with a ridiculously short hemline. He said it led an elegant air to the establishment to have a sissy maid prancing around. 



Vernon liked me in high, high heels, too, unfortunately. Emily came up with the idea of making me wear shoes that were a size too small. Wearing those things fourteen hours a day without being allowed to take breaks was beyond excruciating. It got so bad, I‚Äôd look forward to johns coming over to use me, even though they usually treated me like dirt, because at least it got me off my feet for a while. Look at my feet; you can see how they‚Äôre deformed from all those years in tight heels. Yeah, right ‚Äî pretty ugly, huh? I‚Äôve got lots of scars, man. You don‚Äôt even want to see.



So, anyway, you wanted to know about my routines. I‚Äôd wake up every day at five a.m. and make sure there wasn‚Äôt a hair on my body. Megan and Emily liked to do surprise inspections and would run and tell Vernon if they found the tiniest little hair ‚Äî or sometimes, if they felt like fucking with me, they‚Äôd lie and say I‚Äôd missed a hair, just so they could give me extra punishment. They thought it was funny; plus tattling on me earned them points with Vernon, who didn‚Äôt care whether they were lying or not. As far as he was concerned, nobody needed an excuse to ‚Äòlay stripes on a white sissy‚Äôs ass,‚Äô as he always liked to say.



The twins did that a lot ‚Äî make up shit about me so I‚Äôd get punished ‚Äî especially at first, when they were really trying to impress Vernon, and were testing their power over me. After a while, after they got used to having a slave around, that sort of thing kind of died down, although Vernon would set up competitions between them during my reparations whippings so they‚Äôd go all-out trying to hurt me. But at least they stopped making up stuff about me ‚Äî for the most part, anyway. If they were in a bad mood, or there were people around they wanted to impress, they‚Äôd still do it once in a while.



What are some examples? Oh, jeez, there are so many. There was the time right after Vernon moved in, when Megan lied and told him she‚Äôd caught me sniffing her dirty panties in the clothes hamper. My punishment was an extra whipping, and then Vernon made me wear a roach clip on the end of my nose with a heavy weight attached to it for the rest of the weekend. Oh, and I had to spend two nights in a row with my head in the toilet.



Back in the early days, I always felt like I was this close to passing out ‚Äî that‚Äôs how often I got whipped. I lost a lot of blood ‚Äî plus, they worked me to death, and I didn‚Äôt get a lot to eat on top of it, so I was always feeling dizzy. Eventually, my body got more used to it, but I always felt weak.



My diet? Ugh, you don‚Äôt even want to know, dude. It was ‚Ä¶ ugh, slop. Vernon called it ‚Äòsissy food.‚Äô He always said white sissies weren‚Äôt good enough to eat ‚Äòpeople food,‚Äô so I‚Äôd eat this disgusting glop my sisters would throw into a bucket once a week ‚Äî and, yeah, they‚Äôd usually spit and piss in it, although luckily, Vernon never had me eat poop, since he said it could make me sick or die, and then I wouldn‚Äôt be able to make money for him. Mostly, the slop was dry oatmeal mixed with powdered protein, vitamins, and whatever they could think of to make it taste shitty. One week they might pour a whole bunch of salt in there, or a whole thing of cayenne pepper. I was only allowed to eat at night, after I‚Äôd been sent to my room; Vernon said it was disrespectful for me to eat while everyone else was awake, when I could be spending that time serving them. I had to make the bucket last a whole week, and there was never much in there, so I was always hungry.



Oh, yeah, that‚Äôs another thing the twins always used to lie about ‚Äî they‚Äôd tell Vernon they caught me eating ‚Äòpeople food.‚Äô They did that a whole bunch of times early on. On top of getting the shit beat out of me, eating ‚Äòpeople food‚Äô would usually earn me a starvation diet, and for the next few days, or even a week, depending on Vernon‚Äôs mood, I‚Äôd be on water and vitamin supplements only. It was horrible; I‚Äôd get pounding headaches from not eating, and I‚Äôd get these real dark circles under my eyes if the punishment went on for more than a few days. Of course, I‚Äôd feel even weaker than usual from lack of nutrition, although they cut me no slack whatsoever ‚Äî if I couldn‚Äôt perform my chores and service the clints, I‚Äôd get extra whippings. I‚Äôm telling you, man, it was like hell for me, every single day.



Sex? For me, it meant getting butt-fucked and giving blowjobs and rim-jobs. Vernon said white sissies weren‚Äôt worthy of pussy. I obviously couldn‚Äôt have regular sex with my dick attached to the ring between my legs, but he said I wasn‚Äôt even good enough to lick pussy, so he told my mom and sisters I was only allowed to lick their asses. They didn‚Äôt have me do it much, though, since they said I disgusted them, and they hated me having any contact with their bodies, even my ‚Äòslave tongue.‚Äô Once in a while, Vernon would have me do it to amuse him, or to put on a show for clients ‚Äî oh, and he loved having me rim him, especially after he had all the piercings put in my tongue. Sometimes, he‚Äôd have me under the covers all night licking his ass while he slept, which for me was a mixed bag ‚Äî I mean, it sucked having to lick this evil bastard‚Äôs asshole while he snored and cuddled with my mom, but at least I got to be on a soft mattress all night. 



Well, listen, buddy, thanks for the drinks, but I‚Äôm pretty drunk and I‚Äôm about to pass out. No, I‚Äôm not driving; my building‚Äôs a few blocks away. 



Uh, no, I don‚Äôt have a phone. Can‚Äôt afford one. You‚Äôre dying to hear more? Well, uh, I‚Äôll be back up here after my check comes Tuesday.



Tomorrow? No, I‚Äôm not doing anything. Sure, if you‚Äôre buying, I‚Äôll meet you back here. Six o‚Äôclock? Perfect.



Take it easy. Nice talking to you. See you tomorrow; I‚Äôm gonna go home and cry some more, where I won‚Äôt bother anyone.

‚ÄúVernon‚Äù

by c.w. cobblestone

I‚Äôm sorry to bother you, sir; I‚Äôll try to be quiet. Or I can move to another barstool if you want.

Why am I crying? Listen, I appreciate the concern, but I don‚Äôt want to bug you with MY stupid problems.

Well, okay, if you really want to know, I‚Äôm crying because I‚Äôve dealt with a lot of bad stuff in my life, bro ‚Äî plus, I‚Äôve had four shots of Jack. So, I apologize; I‚Äôm drunk, and I got to thinking about everything and I ‚Ä¶ well, I kind of lost it.

Yeah, it‚Äôs THAT bad. It‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, sometimes everything seems, like, really overwhelming ‚Äî as if all the shit I‚Äôve gone through is catching up to me all at once and I can‚Äôt get away from it, no matter how hard I try to run. Anyway, look, I‚Äôm sorry I bothered you; I didn‚Äôt realize I was being so loud. Sometimes I‚Äôll start crying, you know, and ‚Ä¶ well, I got carried away. I apologize.

What happened to me? Dude, you don‚Äôt want to know. It‚Äôs some fucked-up, twisted shit, man. You‚Äôd need a strong stomach ‚Äî and to be honest, I‚Äôd feel funny talking about it. I‚Äôve never told a soul.

No, no, that‚Äôs okay. You aren‚Äôt prying; you‚Äôre fine. Like I said, I‚Äôve never talked about any of this stuff ‚Äî although a stranger in a bar is probably the best person to tell it all to. And, really, it‚Äôs nice that someone even gives a crap about anything I have to say, you know? I‚Äôm not exactly used to that.

So, okay, screw it ‚Äî what do you want to know? Although I‚Äôm warning you ahead of time: this is some TWISTED shit.

How did my life get so fucked up? Well, now, that‚Äôs not an easy question to answer; I‚Äôd need a whole month! I guess I‚Äôll just start at the beginning:

I was an average teenager who watched sports, played video games, goofed off with my buddies ‚Äî you know, normal kid stuff. I lived in a nice house on two acres just outside Northtown with my mom, dad, older brother Tommy and older twin sisters Megan and Emily. My parents were fairly well-off; Dad was a factory foreman and Mom was a bank manager.

Life was great until just after my eighteenth birthday; that‚Äôs when a Black pimp named Vernon Williams got rid of my father and older brother and took over my family ‚Äî and when I say he got rid of them, I mean he GOT RID of them. Like, permanently.

Yes, he killed them. I TOLD YOU my life was fucked up! That‚Äôs not even the worst of it, bro.

After Vernon moved in, he turned me into a transgendered slave, and that‚Äôs how I spent the next twenty years of my life. Hell no, I‚Äôm not kidding ‚Äî you can see where he marked me with this tattoo on my neck, and I‚Äôve also got a ‚ÄòV‚Äô branded on my butt. I was forced to be Vernon‚Äôs personal slave, and turned tricks for him from the time I was eighteen until the sonofabitch died a few years ago.

About a month after Vernon‚Äôs funeral, I finally worked up the courage to get my hair cut and start dressing as a man again ‚Äî although even now when I put my clothes on in the morning, my heart starts pounding like crazy and my palms get all sweaty. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm scared Vernon is going to rise up from the dead and punish me for defying him.

Yeah, I know that sounds stupid, but that‚Äôs the kind of hold he still has over me, even from the grave. I‚Äôm telling you, dude ‚Äî I‚Äôll never recover from all the terrible things that man did to me.

It‚Äôs hard to describe Vernon. He was a force of nature, that‚Äôs all there is to it. He wormed his way into my family and rearranged the universe to suit his needs, and there was nothing I could do to stop him. I was an innocent kid going about my life when this tornado suddenly blows through my house, and the next thing I know I‚Äôm stuck in hell without a friend in the fucking world, I‚Äôm everyone‚Äôs slave, and I‚Äôm not even allowed to act like a boy anymore. It all just hit me out of nowhere.

Our new reality fucked me up bad, but my mom and sisters couldn‚Äôt have been happier. They were infatuated with Vernon from the second they laid eyes on him, and they embraced every bit of the insanity he brought to our doorstep. Vernon was a handsome, smooth-talking pimp who had done two stints in prison, and he was a master of ‚ÄòThe Game.‚Äô Mom, Megan, Emily ‚Äî they all fell for his hustle, big-time.

Mom fell for him first. According to the story she retold a thousand times, Vernon stole her heart after approaching her table in the Glass Onion Restaurant to tell her how beautiful she looked. My mom had walked into that place during her lunch hour as Diana Gilchrist, the buttoned-down, no-nonsense branch manager of the First National Bank, but after five minutes with Vernon she was a goddamned ball of jelly. One fuck from the big-dicked sonofabitch in a sleazy motel room was all it took for Mom to blow up her life ‚Äî and she took the rest of us down with her.

She became a completely different person overnight. She started going out all the time, rubbing Dad‚Äôs nose in the fact that she was seeing some six-foot-four Black dude named Vernon who was, she constantly told my father, ‚Äúa hundred times more man than you‚Äôll ever be.‚Äù Mom changed her hairdo and wardrobe, and she‚Äôd stay out all night and come staggering home the next morning smirking and carrying her shoes.

Poor Dad was turned upside-down ‚Äî he was convinced Mom was having some type of mental breakdown, and there were constant arguments over her refusal to ‚Äòseek help.‚Äô He even tried to get Mom to see a priest; when she got done laughing at him, she literally spit in his face.

It all came to a head the night Mom invited her new boyfriend to our house. The arrogant sonofabitch struts in like he owns the place, plops on the couch, props his feet on the coffee table, snaps his fingers and orders my mother to fetch him a beer. She runs to the kitchen while the rest of us are looking on in shock.

My dad, a longtime factory rat named Thomas Gilchrist, was a proud man, and my older brother Tommy took after him. They tried to stand up to Vernon.

You didn‚Äôt stand up to Vernon.

It was the last lesson they ever learned.

Mom collected a ton of insurance money from the ‚Äòaccident‚Äô that killed my father and only brother. According to the coroner‚Äôs report, they were both electrocuted in our basement while working on the fuse box. After the insurance company investigation was complete and the settlement check had been cut, Mom turned the cash over to Vernon, as she did with her paychecks from the bank.

Vernon told us to stay quiet about the ‚Äòaccident in the basement,‚Äô so we never again spoke of my dad and my brother. In fact, this is the first time I‚Äôve mentioned either of them out loud since it all happened, and I ‚Ä¶ uh ‚Ä¶ I ‚Ä¶

I-I‚Äôm sorry. I ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt mean to break down like that. Hang on ‚Ä¶ give me just a minute to pull myself together. Ugh. I apologize. It‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ well, that sonofabitch snuffed them out. My father. My brother. Poof! Gone. And then right after that ‚Ä¶ well, my life became such a fucking horror show that I didn‚Äôt have time to even think about them. I try not to think about them now, to be honest, because it hurts too bad. Thomas Gilchrist and Thomas Gilchrist II ‚Ä¶ they were literally erased from existence while the rest of us got lost in Vernon‚Äôs sick fucking world.

It all happened so fast. Less than a month after Vernon approached my mother in that restaurant, my dad and older brother were dead, I had a new alpha male living in my house who was fucking everyone left in my family ‚Äî including me ‚Äî and I had lost my freedom and dignity, not to mention my very identity as a male.

Vernon‚Äôs hateful worldview had been formed in prison, where he‚Äôd mastered the art of feminizing scared whitebois. As far as Vernon was concerned, Black people were supreme, white women were born to worship them, and white males were repugnant pieces of shit who were only good as ‚Äòsissy slaves or worm food,‚Äô as he liked to say. My mom and sisters totally bought into this warped philosophy, and they helped Vernon beat the manhood right out of me before it even took hold. I was a normal, happy, eighteen-year-old kid one minute, and a trans slave living in some perverted version of hell the next.

Why didn‚Äôt I just run away? Shit, you don‚Äôt think I wanted to? I thought about it every day, bro. But Vernon told me if I ever tried to escape, he‚Äôd track me down and I‚Äôd end up like Tommy and my dad. He had the cops paid off, too, so going to them wasn‚Äôt an option. I was stuck and I knew it ‚Äî my only two choices were to obey Vernon or die. Obviously, I obeyed, although I wonder every day now if that was the right decision, and whether things might‚Äôve been better all-around had I just let the sonofabitch kill me.

Instead, he molded me into the kind of slave he wanted, and it was a fucking nightmare every day of my life. Whenever I‚Äôd leave the house to go shopping or run errands, I‚Äôd have to pretend to be happy, and act like I‚Äôd willingly transitioned to being female. Back then, being trans was a bigger deal than it is now, and I caught a lot of shit for it when I‚Äôd run into my old friends ‚Äî but, of course, I did everything Vernon said without hesitation, no matter how embarrassing or painful it was for me. The guy scares me to this day, even though he‚Äôs been dead for years. Look at my hand; I‚Äôm shaking just talking about him.

Like I said, after Vernon moved in, my life became one long nightmare. Everyone in the house hated me. Before Vernon took over, my older sisters had bullied me a little, you know, as older siblings tend to do. But that evil bastard turned them and my mom completely against me, to the point where they‚Äôd look for reasons to make me miserable so they could score brownie points with him. When they‚Äôd do something mean to me, they‚Äôd always look to Vernon for praise. And he gave it to them ‚Äî especially by filling them with his big, black cock. They were hypnotized by it, and had conversations about it when he wasn‚Äôt around.

It was crazy how much they were in love with Vernon. They‚Äôd have eaten his toenail clippings if he‚Äôd told them to. And the thing he wanted them to do the most was to keep me in my place; he loved the idea of turning a virgin white boy into a sissy slave before he even had a chance to be a man. The sick motherfucker was obsessed by it. So, my world became an endless loop of misery after misery.

I still have a hard time processing just how bad it really was. And it went on literally every day of my life ‚Äî Vernon‚Äôs rule was that I had to receive at least one whipping per day as part of the ‚Äòreparations‚Äô I owed for being born a ‚Äòpathetic white boi.‚Äô He‚Äôd usually have my sisters do the punishment, and they‚Äôd try to impress him by seeing who could make me cry first, or which one could break the skin the quickest.

During my reparations whippings, Mom would cuddle with Vernon on the couch, watching the show with her lips curled up in an amused little smirk while I bawled my poor eyes out. You‚Äôll have to try to imagine the betrayal I felt during those moments ‚Äî it‚Äôs impossible for me to describe, man. The physical pain was nothing compared to the realization that my own mother had taken this evil man‚Äôs side against me and thought it was funny to watch me crying and in pain.

After my daily reparations had been paid it was time to go to work. Vernon had my mom, sisters and me all turning tricks for him, while during the day my mother also worked at her high-paying bank job. Our lives were dedicated to pleasing and enriching Vernon, so we turned over every dime we made to the smug bastard, who took it as his due.

Although Vernon treated my mom and sisters fine, he‚Äôd beat the shit out of me if he didn‚Äôt think I was making enough money for him, even though that was completely out of my hands, since he ran a whorehouse and the johns who came in either wanted me or they didn‚Äôt. And woe betide me should a customer ever complain that I hadn‚Äôt satisfied him ‚Äî or worse, that I‚Äôd been disrespectful. That only happened twice, and each time the client had lied about it because they wanted to see me get extra punishment. I‚Äôm telling you, man ‚Äî it was fucked up. I had no say whatsoever, and if a client told Vernon I‚Äôd been disrespectful, or wasn‚Äôt being enthusiastic or submissive enough, it was just too bad for me. The clients were always right, so as you can imagine I kissed their asses ‚Äî literally and figuratively. Everyone knew I was scared to death they might give me a bad report, so they really treated me like shit, knowing I‚Äôd do anything they wanted.

In keeping with Vernon‚Äôs Afrocentric philosophy, we were only allowed to service Black clients, and before long he had a lucrative enterprise going, along with a reputation as being one of the most successful ‚ÄòMack Daddies‚Äô in town. He eventually brought in other women, and even another white slave, pinky, an older guy who was married to one of Vernon‚Äôs bitches. They moved in when I was about twenty. Vernon turned him into a sissy, too, although customers usually didn‚Äôt want him because he was pretty old. It was nice having help with the housework, though.

Our former family home became a hangout for Vernon‚Äôs Black friends, and a whorehouse for upscale African American clients who paid top dollar for three beautiful blondes ‚Äî a MILF and her hot twin daughters ‚Äî or, if their tastes were kinkier, a pierced, hairless young sissy who would obey any order and endure any punishment that didn‚Äôt cause permanent damage. Like I said, Vernon had the cops paid off, and our house was pretty secluded, so there were never any problems with people coming and going at all hours.

From the time Vernon took over until the day he died, I never got a break; my inferior position as a ‚Äòpathetic white boi‚Äô was drilled into me every minute of every day by him, the women in my family and the Black johns and guests who visited our master‚Äôs home. New rules were constantly thrown at me ‚Äî it was hard keeping up with them all. The first day Vernon moved in he told me about the ‚Äòreparations whippings‚Äô I‚Äôd be receiving daily. Next, I was informed that looking a Black person in the eye, unless specifically ordered to do so, constituted major disrespect and was cause for severe punishment. Ditto for contradicting a Black superior, or interrupting their conversations, unless it was an emergency.

Then, I was barred from using furniture, other than when I was sexually servicing someone; Emily came up with that rule when she caught me sitting down at the kitchen table taking a break after I‚Äôd spent eleven hours on heels cleaning the house one Saturday. From then on the concrete basement floor near the hot water heater was my bed and I wasn‚Äôt allowed any breaks from the time I woke up at five a.m. until every member of the household had gone to bed or I‚Äôd been dismissed for the evening. I started sleeping on a bed a few weeks after Vernon died and it took a long time to get used to it.

I went through a lot of physical changes, and had tons of medical issues, too. Fuck, I almost died. When I turned twenty-one, Vernon had me get size double-D silicone boobs, although there were major problems from the start. My body kept rejecting the implants and they leaked like crazy. We tried a bunch of times, but the doctors finally told me I‚Äôd die if I kept them in. Vernon wasn‚Äôt happy about it ‚Äî every time I‚Äôd come home from the ER, he‚Äôd beat the shit out of me and threaten to kill me because he said I wasn‚Äôt able to serve him like a ‚Äòproper sissy.‚Äô

Oh, yeah, absolutely, the nurses would ask about my bruises, and they even had me go see a social worker a few times. But I always told them I was in a consensual S&M relationship, which is what Vernon had told me to say. I don‚Äôt think they believed me but there wasn‚Äôt anything they could do, since Vernon was smart about it, and waited until I was of legal age before allowing me to come in contact with anyone other than people I ran into while I was out shopping or whatever.

Why didn‚Äôt I say something? I told you, dude ‚Äî he had the cops paid off. Shit, half the Northtown Police Department would come by to fuck my mom and sisters for free; the Black cops, anyway. Like I told you, Vernon didn‚Äôt allow his bitches to fuck white guys. No, none of the cops ever had sex with me, although there was one assistant chief, a huge dude from Georgia, who‚Äôd pay a lot of money to beat the living shit out of me. I mean, he really beat me down; I‚Äôd be out of commission for at least a few weeks, which is why Vernon charged so much money, and would only let him do it once or twice a year. I was glad when he transferred to another department; I used to hate to see that guy coming!

So, anyway, my implants kept leaking, and Vernon would make me go get new ones. When the regular doctors refused to do it anymore after the fifth try, Vernon found some underground sleazeball who‚Äôd had his medical license revoked. Eventually, even he said he didn‚Äôt want to keep doing it because he was sure I‚Äôd die. I was constantly sick during all this, and would get beat for throwing up so much. Oh, my gawd, one time I threw up while a client was face-fucking me, and I got beat so bad I had to sleep on my stomach for two weeks. I was shivering all the time and the clients started complaining. Vernon eventually realized he had no choice: if he wanted to keep me around and wanted me looking like a girl, I‚Äôd have to wear falsies.

Of course, the evil sonofabitch had my sisters sew the fake boobs onto my flesh, and twice a month they‚Äôd take out the stitches, disinfect the area and then sew them back on in a slightly different spot. That kept the area from getting infected, and created a lot more pain for me, especially when they‚Äôd attach weights to them or pull on them. Like I said, they LOOKED for ways to make my life miserable.

I also got several piercings ‚Äî three on my tongue, all these holes you see on my ears, and ‚Ä¶ um, I also had my dickhead pierced; Vernon had it pulled way back and attached to a ring back by my butthole, so it was always tucked between my legs. For years he talked about having me castrated, too, but he never did it, thank goodness. After Vernon died, I was able to get all the rings off with a wire-cutter ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt about to go to a doctor to have it done!

The other stuff, I can‚Äôt get rid of. Vernon wanted us all marked, so he had Mom, Megan and Emily each get tattoos on their asses ‚Äî black spades with ‚ÄòV‚Äôs‚Äô running through them, just like the one on my neck. And I told you, my left ass-cheek was branded with a huge ‚ÄòV.‚Äô My ‚Äòbranding ceremony‚Äô came during a party Vernon threw for my mom‚Äôs birthday that turned into an orgy in our living room, with me tied to a sawhorse, bent over and crying, available to anyone who wanted to fuck me in the ass and/or slap my fresh burn wound.

There were lots of nights like that, which were miserable for me but great fun for everyone else. My entire family ‚Äî those of us who survived, that is ‚Äî underwent Vernon‚Äôs indoctrination, and in a just short time this racist street hustler had become our unquestioned lord and master, with me on the bottom rung of the fucked-up hierarchy he imposed on our household. The number one job of my mom, sisters and me was to please Vernon, and to show the utmost respect to every Black King or Queen he invited into his home. To this day, whenever I get near a Black person, my pulse quickens, and I can‚Äôt look them in the eye.

After Vernon Williams entered my life, not a day has gone by where I haven‚Äôt thought about what a disgusting white piece of shit I am, and how I deserve everything that‚Äôs happened to me. Then, my rational brain will jump in and I‚Äôll tell myself that I don‚Äôt deserve it; that I was just an innocent eighteen-year-old kid whose relatives were either snuffed out or controlled by an evil, manipulative criminal, and that I should get sympathy, not contempt, for what happened to me.

And then, because I‚Äôm so fucked in the head from all those years of brainwashing and abuse, I‚Äôll stop trying to boost my self-esteem and remember what Vernon taught me: that I‚Äôm a lowlife white piece of shit who doesn‚Äôt deserve anything good.

So ‚Ä¶ there you go, bro. You wanted to know why I was crying? That‚Äôs why I was crying. I want good things. I want to love myself. But I can‚Äôt. Vernon saw to that.

He‚Äôs been dead for four years now ‚Äî cancer did what no mortal ever could ‚Äî and since then, my life has been a fucking fog, man. They gave me SSI because of all my mental problems. I‚Äôve lost track of my mom and sisters; they‚Äôre used-up, skanky whores now, wandering around in the ghetto somewhere, smoking crack and turning whatever tricks they can. Fuck them. I‚Äôll never forgive them for the way they threw me under the bus and took Vernon‚Äôs side against me. Especially my mom. She was supposed to protect me ‚Ä¶ you know? Aren‚Äôt moms supposed to protect their kids ‚Äî not throw them to the fucking wolves? Aren‚Äôt moms supposed to protect their fucking kids, man? Aren‚Äôt they? Your own mom?

I ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry. No, I‚Äôm getting all sappy again. I didn‚Äôt mean to start blabbering like that. Look at me ‚Äî what a fucking joke I am. I‚Äôm a washed-out loser in a dive bar, getting drunk and crying like a fucking baby. I‚Äôm really sorry to bother you, man. I know I can be annoying.

What‚Äôs that? I‚Äôm not bothering you? You‚Äôre dying to hear more?

Um ‚Ä¶ okay. If you‚Äôll buy me another shot, I need to get all this shit off my chest anyway. Thanks.

I stepped out looking handsome as hell winking at all the ladies and homoerotic men, I found on the way staring me down for obvious reasons! My break was 2 hours, and I sat myself down, reading Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Idiot while sipping on my coffee.

I saw a beautiful girl with her friends, knowing I had a sophisticated work of literature, and I was wearing my best fit, white button-down shirt, dress pants, belt, and an elegant silk tie to match, I made my move like a wolf hunting prey, we made eye contact, and I went in for the kill, but in this case the romantic intrigue. I walked up saying, ""my good madame, I am Sir Gibson, I am a student at the University of Michigan, and I want to say you look very fine today. May I have the pleasure of accompanying you in a delicate chat while we sip on this good coffee?""

Her eyes sparkled before me impressed by my dapper use of the English vocabulary, as the kids say I was spitting game, she took a seat next to me, and I nearly lost track of time in our conversation, it was among the most proper and refined of conversations I had, but a good sir disturbed our conversation. He walks in dressed like a brute wearing a wife beater with unshaved arm pits, this man does not fit into this environment. He begins screeching ""you elitist prick get away from my girl!""

Gob smacked I respond ""do you know her? What here conundrum did I spawn myself into for the sake of a pretty girl!"" I straightened myself forward ready to fight with facts and logic.

The woman replies earnestly, ""I do not know this gentleman, he is a brute who has spawned from outside Ann Arbor, invading our glorious college town with pick-up trucks, and misogyny!""

He begins cracking his knuckles, and I begin to get ready to pounce, misogyny, and evil has come forward to invade our pleasant college town, and I am the final defense, the Saviour of Umich, the ultimate weapon the one they speak of.

I begin spitting facts, putting this brute in his place, using spells I learned from D&D, and telling him ""You shall not pass this barrier, one for the educator, and one for the student. You have not shaved those pits, and you belong in a pit, away with you!""

I watched a hole form beneath his two feet, and he was sucked under, Satan himself heard my pleas, and logic. As he was sunk below the girl kissed me holding my hands, thanking me for everything I have done, and the employees behind the counter clapped. I saved the day and hopped back in my BMW sunglasses on, windows rolled down to finish my last midterm. Another day of college completed.",31,1740711135.0,uofm,6,0.79,False

1izxpa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/petsitting/comments/1izxpa7/please_share_your_exit_and_final_day_cleaning/,Please share your exit and final day cleaning routine with me? Been told I'm doing too much.,"I recently had my mum stay with me on a 2 week sit, with permission of course. She was absolutely floored with my exit routine, said I'm doing far too much and going above and beyond my job as home and pet sitter. 
I don't know whether it's my adhd and severe anxiety, but I basically do a full house clean at the end, including vac and mop floors, clean the bathroom (sink, shower, bath, and toilet), sweep outside or use a blower if they have one, wipe all surfaces, clean the stove top/ splash back, fully clean the coffee machine and refill with beans and water, wash, dry, fold and replace/ put away almost every soft furnishing including towels, sheets, couch throw rugs etc, all dishes washed and put away, remake the beds if they're finished washing and I have time before I leave, otherwise I leave them in the washing machine or dryer and apologise in my exit note, take out the rubbish and refill with clean bag, if I used the washing machine for my own things I'll clean out the filters, wipe out the fridge once I've removed my food, etc etc. Basically I do what a paid cleaner would do, on the day before and morning I leave. Is this really too much? I know I wouldn't want to come home from holiday and have to dive straight in to a bunch of housework, especially if I hadn't been the one living there at the time, so I try to leave the place fairly spotless in consideration for the HO. Of course this is on top of all the regular daily pet and home responsibilities. 

I already know I severely undercharge, ($35AUD/nt for a basic domestic set up, ie a cpl dogs and a cat, I purposely don't advertise my price because anything more I adjust in the enquiry stage before I quote them), I'll be increasing my rates very soon, but currently my anxiety won't allow. 

I'd love to see your to-do list for your exit days, and your opinions on whether this is normal or I'm being taken advantage of and need to cut myself some slack? 

My current sit very cheekily added an extra dog the day before they were leaving, after I'd already done the meet and greet. I was told he was easy, as I was told the others were, so I only added $5/ night. I haven't slept through the night once in a week, last night I was up and down around 10 times with anxious dogs, toilet needs, elderly dog supervision in the yard, and a cat that just won't stop crying all night whether it's in, out, fed, cuddled, anything. I ended up leaving the door wide open from around 3:30am, but it didn't matter cos the large dog won't even get off the couch to check if it's open, just woofs until you go and coax him out, he won't even go thru a doorway unless you're encouraging him and have your hands on his back end for confidence to walk thru the damn door. The small ones were with me with the bedroom door closed, so the old one couldn't wander off in the yard, but they're both up and down like yoyo's all night as well. This goes on all day as well as all night, every day, every night. 

I'm spent.

I've got another 2 nights, so tomorrow will be my cleaning day, and after all this ""special needs"" care I wasn't aware of, I just want to know what's truly expected for the final exit presentation. 

Thanks so much. From your exhausted Aussie. ",3,1740710994.0,petsitting,11,1.0,False

1izxlha,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1izxlha/when_i_was_sixteen_homeless_kids_were_going/,"When I was sixteen, homeless kids were going missing in my town. I was one of them.","I won't go into detail why I was thrown out of my house at sixteen. Financial problems/I came from a poor family. 

Mom and Dad wanted me to get a job, and I wanted to stay in school, so that caused arguments. 

I also made the mistake of revealing to them an intimate part of myself I should've kept fucking hidden. 

Look, I won't say being on the street was ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. 

But being away from that toxic environment was like a breath of fresh air. 

I lived in a pretty big town, and there were a lot of kids living on the streets. 

I did try and find somewhere at first. 

I stayed in hotels with my last remaining cash, but then I found myself with the option of eating or starving. I was VERY stubborn at sixteen. I hated asking for handouts, and just the idea of asking my school for help was like ‚Äúlosing‚Äù. 

I didn't want my friends and teachers to know about my situation, so I dropped school. Again, I was a stupid stubborn kid. 

I obviously should have asked for help, but back then, teachers didn't care. 

Kids in my school were severely bullied, and nothing ever changed. 

They were there to teach, and that was it. 

So, the thought of telling them I was fucking homeless just wasn't happening. 

I didn't want their pity. 

I didn't want their attempt to try empathize with me when in reality, they did not give a fuck. 

So, yes, I ended up on the streets. 

But there was a community of us. 

We were all in the same situation. Thrown out for the same reasons. 

Toxic and abusive parents, or significant others. 

So, all we had were each other. 

I've seen homeless kids depicted on TV/movies as scrappy pickpockets. 

That's a lie. The kids who I hung with weren't brave enough to pick-pocket. 

If they saw cash/food/anything they wanted hanging around unclaimed, they would snatch it up. 

The pickpocket thing is just the media glamorizing the idea of being a street kid, turning them into a ‚Äúfun, quirky group of teenage criminals trying to survive.‚Äù

The reality is a lot more depressing. 

I ended up in a group of kids on the south side of our town. 

Ben, the leader of our gang, was the latest to disappear. 

Look, I didn't believe in the ‚Äúchild catcher‚Äù rumors. 

I thought they were just stories‚Äîbut it became evident someone was actually kidnapping street kids. 

I may have come from a toxic house, but I was sheltered. 

I didn't think things like that existed. 

I had never been in the type of situation when they COULD exist. 

Kidnapping was like a foreign concept to me. 

It only happened in movies and cartoons. 

But then familiar faces I knew started to disappear‚Äì Carly, a street performer who was trying to earn enough money to leave town. Jason, the weird kid with the eyepatch who tried to steal my phone. 

These kids weren't friends, but they felt comfortable. 

They felt like a community, even when I wasn't personally close with them. 

Carly always smiled at me, offering me fresh donuts some old man handed her in the morning. 

Jason was always skulking around the music stores, asking for change. 

Every time I saw him, we talked about things that didn't even matter. 

But talking to him made me feel less alone. When Jason disappeared, that normalcy I‚Äôd gotten used to started to fade. I looked for him, but his familiar purple woolen hat had vanished. 

Carly was always singing under the bridge every afternoon. 

I could hear her voice while snoozing in the park entrance. She sounded like an angel. 

With her gone, I felt colder than usual. 

I couldn't get warm no matter how many times I rubbed my hands together and stuck my them under my coat. I had holes in my socks and shoes, and the freezing chill was creeping into my bones. 

Carly‚Äôs disappearance really shook me. 

Especially when, several days later, a guy took her spot with his guitar, screaming out painfully bad reimaginings of pop songs. 

When Ben vanished, I started taking word-of-mouth more seriously. 

*""He's been taken by the white van,""*  was the rumor floating around. 

Apparently, some kid saw Ben getting dragged into a white van. 

This kid was also known to say BS to get attention, but his claim was actually believable. 

Ben, Carly, Jason, and the other missing kids were last seen at the homeless shelter. 

So, the place where kids were vanishing‚Äîwasn't exactly ideal.

But it *did* have hot soup and coffee, as well as a place to charge my phone, so I risked it.

The homeless shelter was where most kids hung out every day. 

I used the mostly broken facilities to shower, use the bathroom, and try to make connections with kids who were well known. It was pretty much a survival instinct at this point. 

If I was going to survive on the streets, I needed people I could count on. 

I had this constant need to get my name out there. Just in case I was one of the missing. 

But it turns out, not all homeless kids play nice. 

I won't go into detail, but there were a lot of names I thought I could trust, and quickly learned that I couldn't fucking trust anyone. 

I got my (first) phone stolen, and then my shoes were snatched while I was sleeping. 

I was definitely hardened after a while on the streets. 

So, when Charlie came along, I basically told him to go fuck himself. 

All of the ‚Äòconnections‚Äô I made just lost me cash, food, and my shit. The worst thing you can be as a street kid is nice. 

If you want to be left alone, you have to make it very fucking clear.

Without Ben‚Äôs leadership, things went off the handle. 

I was quickly labeled as a naive bastard who f/w anyone. 

Most of my spots were compromised, so I had no choice but to once again risk the homeless shelter. 

My initial plan was to grab food and coffee, and make a run for it. 

I had the town library as a safe spot until 4pm, and after 10, the guy who owned the Chinese takeout begrudgingly let me sleep in his doorway. 

I think he felt sorry for me. But at this point I was too fucking cold to care about pride. 

The volunteers in the soup kitchen were my age. I didn't know them (thankfully), but I was eager to get out of there. 

The food was a choice of cold curry or soup. I chose soup, and a chunk of stale bread. 

The coffee was always lukewarm, but it was coffee. I wasn't going to complain. 

I was trying to eat it as fast as I could without burning my mouth, when a kid I can only describe as the human embodiment of a golden retriever slid next to me, grasping his own bowl of soup.  

With dark brown hair under his hood and freckled cheeks‚Äî not to mention his expensive jacket and shoes‚ÄîI knew the streets would eat him alive.

This kid looked like he'd stepped right out of a perfect suburban home. 

He had a Mommy and Daddy, and a perfect fucking life. Lucky him. 

I was having  a hard time taking in his expensive clothes. 

Yes, his hair was greasy and his clothes were slightly discolored (holes in his gloves, dirt smearing his face) so he was clearly sleeping rough. 

But this guy was ASKING to get his branded coat stolen. 

""Take *that* off,"" I said through a mouthful of stale bread.

That was all I could say. I didn't want to say ‚Äúhi‚Äù, because *hi‚Äù was an invitation to join me. I was on my third phone, and I wasn't taking any chances with this kid. 

Two years of fucking with the wrong people, I was done. 

I nodded at his jacket, and he looked confused. 

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

""Put it in your backpack, idiot.‚Äù I was just warning him of my past mistakes. 

I DID have my dad's expensive watch, and some shoes I bought with money from a summer job before I left home. 

I lost both of them because I failed to hide them. 

Elizabeth and Mari, two older girls I thought I could trust, were now proud owners of my shit. 

The guy had this docile look on his face, eyes wide like a fucking deer. 

I had no idea how he had survived this long. If he was sleeping in the shelter, yes it was ‚Äúsafer‚Äù, and warmer, but it also made him a target for kidnapping. 

‚ÄúUnless you *want* to lose it.‚Äù I added, finishing my soup. 

The guy continued eating, completely unbothered. 

‚ÄúYour jacket.‚Äù I said, directly. 

I didn't lose my patience much, but this guy was testing me. 

‚ÄúTake it *off*, or you will lose it.‚Äù

After being fucked around with by Ben‚Äôs asshole friends, it felt strangely good to be an asshole back to a total stranger. 

The kid hesitated, before pulling off his jacket and backpack, awkwardly yanking off the jacket, and stuffing it inside his bag.

Then he sat there shivering like an idiot, and I gave up and offered him one of my spare sweaters. 

Street kids usually wanted something in return, and I was waiting for his proposition.

Instead, he said, ‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù and pulled it on.

‚ÄúI'm Charlie.‚Äù he introduced himself, when I stood to leave, grabbing my own pack. 

I told him I didn't ask, and that it was nice meeting him. 

When he followed me, I thought we were just going the same direction. 

But then I took a turn down an alleyway, and his footsteps hesitated, before coming after me. I was all ready to get him to beat it, but looked lost. 

He had this look on his face, like he was trying and failing to look intimidating. 

This kid didn't look like he was going to steal my shit while I was sleeping. 

I didn't officially ask him to join me, it just sort of happened? 

When I got back to my spot, he dropped his pack and started unrolling his sleeping bag next to mine.

I took advantage of his kindness, that innocence that was yet to be drained from him by every stone-cold night that never seemed to end. 

Midnight and dawn felt like centuries apart, and I was never warm enough. 

My toes were always numb, my fingers losing all feeling. 

The worst part was when I didn't have enough to eat, so I started fantasizing. 

But Charlie never lost that stupid fucking smile. Even when he was freezing to death. 

I told him to grab us food for the night‚Äì and he came back with two pizza rolls, and a can of soda to share. 

I asked him *how* he'd gotten them, and he shrugged with a grin. 

This kid expected me to play along with his cryptic games every time he did something vaguely helpful. 

I didn't care how he'd gotten them. 

I was just thankful. 

I started to see Charlie as less of a nuisance, and more of a friend. 

Charlie was loud and obnoxious, and drove me insane with his ‚Äòdreams‚Äô of getting out of town and his situation. 

But he  made me smile‚Äîeven in freezing temperatures. 

He never told me about *why* he was on the streets. 

Instead, he always changed the subject back to me. 

I didn't realize how self centered I was until I spilled my entire life story to him, and when he opened up about himself, I started talking about *myself* once again. 

In a way, I think I saw it like a competition. ‚ÄúOh, your life is bad? Well, *this* happened to me.‚Äù

I waited for him to get frustrated or angry, but he just listened. 

He always listened. 

It was snowing when the two of us sat shivering on a wall, our legs dangling. 

I don't remember who's genius idea it was to sit in sub zero temperatures, but I remember enjoying the icy breeze on my face. Everything was covered in white. 

I don't think I should have enjoyed snow. 

It was extremely fucking easy to freeze to death in these conditions. 

But it was also *snow*. 

And I was still a stupid kid. I still liked snow. 

Charlie was, as usual, being his chipper self. 

He scored us a pack of chips to share, so we were passing it back and forth. 

My hands were so numb I couldn't even feel the chips. I just stuffed them in my mouth. ""Do you believe in angels, Finn?"" 

That question caught me off guard. Charlie‚Äôs gaze was glued to a little girl perfecting a snow angel in front of us. 

The answer was no.

I didn't believe in God. Any God's. Any religion. 

If God existed, or the ‚Äúangels‚Äù, my parents wouldn't have kicked me out for liking guys. 

In the earlier days, I prayed for help.

I had the stupid idea that my mom would actually hunt me down and take me back home. 

But God didn't exist, at least not to me‚Äîand I was tired of pretending. 

I didn't respond to Charlie, and his head dropped onto my shoulder. 

I jerked back, swallowing a hiss. I shoved him away, and for the first time since I'd met him, his smile started to fade. 

""Sorry,"" he muttered, rubbing his hands together. Charlie seemed to notice our proximity, shuffling away from me. 

He said I was warm, and I hated myself for shouting at him. 

Because he was fucking warm too. 

I liked the feeling of his head on my shoulder. 

He felt safe and warm, and the closest thing I had to a home. 

I jumped off the wall, making an excuse to distance myself. 

I think I told him I was going to the shelter to try to find warm clothes from the lost and found. 

Charlie didn't reply, only jerking his head in a nod. 

He told me he‚Äôd be right there when I got back, and his words settled my twisting gut, the growing lump in my throat. 

I used my time away from him to come to terms with my feelings, and instead of pushing them away, like I had done for so long, suppressing and fucking swallowing them down, I realized I wanted Charlie to stay with me. 

Charlie was Home. 

I had barely known this kid for a few months, and yet with him, I didn't feel cold anymore. 

I went back to the wall, ready to apologize to Charlie, but to my surprise, he was gone. I figured he'd gone searching for food since it was almost around dinner time, so I waited. 

I waited until the sky was dark, and I was so fucking cold, my bones ached. 

I noticed an old man who was playing chess with pigeons earlier. 

Charlie had pointed him out, laughing at one particular pigeon, who seemed too self aware. 

I hurried over to him. 

‚ÄúDid you see me earlier?‚Äù I twisted around, pointing at the wall the two of us sat on. 

The man nodded. ‚ÄúOh, you're looking for your friend?‚Äù He slid another chess piece across the board. ‚ÄúI believe he walked away with a man a few hours ago now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat man?‚Äù I felt like I was going to puke. 

I asked him to describe the guy, but the old man shrugged. 

‚ÄúI have bad eyes, kid. It was just a man. Late forties, I think.‚Äù 

His expression softened when my stomach crawled into my throat. 

‚ÄúAre you all right?‚Äù he reached into his pocket and pulled out a sour candy, dropping it into my hand. 

‚ÄúYou should go home now, kid. I'm sure your parents are worried about you.‚Äù

Again, I asked him to describe this man, this time through my teeth. 

But the old guy just turned back to his one-man chess game. 

I think part of me was in denial. 

I went back to our sleeping spot, expecting Charlie to be there, already comfortable in his sleeping bag, talking about optimistic BS. 

But he wasn't. 

I ran back to the shelter with his name choked in my mouth. 

I was living my own personal nightmare. Being snatched into the night, and nobody even knowing my name. 

I just got weird looks, kids looking progressively more freaked out. 

I wouldn't accept it at first. 

Charlie could have been anywhere. But the longer I waited for him in all of our spots, It became clear that Charlie was just another missing street kid who was there one minute, and gone the next. 

He was another Ben. 

Another Carly. 

But this time, I made the mistake of getting to know him.

He was more than a name. 

Charlie was my friend. 

I asked strangers if they'd seen him. 

Passers by looked me up and down like I was dirt on their shoe.

These people had places to be. 

They didn't care about some faceless kid disappearing from the street. 

I already knew what they were thinking when they offered pitiful smiles, and said things like: *‚ÄúSorry, I don't know.‚Äù*

*""I can't help you, kid. I'm... sure he's out there somewhere.""*

They were wondering *why* Charlie was sleeping rough in the first place. 

Why he didn't just ‚Äòget help‚Äô. 

I'm going to tell you the hardest thing I've come to realize. 

It's easy to be numb on the streets. 

Easy to shut down. Easy to forget to mourn, because it was too fucking cold. 

I didn't forget about Charlie, but I did bury him, so I wouldn't forget how to survive. 

So, a month later, I thought I was fucking hallucinating when I saw that all too familiar jacket; the one I told him MULTIPLE TIMES to keep out of sight. 

It was snowing again, and it was thick and wet, clinging to my jeans. 

I was trying to find a patch of concrete free of snow to dump my sleeping bag. 

I scored hand warmers from one kid who was nice enough to offer them for a DS I'd found. 

There he was. Somehow. 

Charlie was standing in the middle of an empty road, in dead of night. 

I didn't question why or *how*. I just hugged him, mentally promising myself I would never let him go again. 

Charlie was so warm.

His coat was thicker, and his backpack was nowhere to be seen. 

""Where did you go?!"" I demanded, shoving him back. 

Charlie just smiled, and I noticed his pocket, an iphone sticking out. 

I think I was about to laugh, wondering just how he‚Äôd managed to get an iPhone, when a clammy hand suddenly clamped over my mouth. 

Warm arms wrapped around my torso and yanked me back. 

I screamed, but my cries were muffled‚Äîthe hand clamping tighter until I couldn‚Äôt fucking breathe.

I remember being violently dragged back, my feet stumbling, my body struggling to stay upright.

I was dragged halfway down the street, hoisted onto a stranger‚Äôs shoulders, and dumped into the back of an awaiting van.

It didn't feel like it was happening to me. 

All those nights I had nightmares about being the next kid snatched away. 

I never thought it would be *me*. 

I couldn't even cry out, my body felt paralyzed. 

I was dragged backwards through snow, and then I was on my knees on the ice-cold flooring of a van jerking left to right, staring at shutters being pulled down like I was an animal. 

I dived forward, but I was trapped.

""I'm sorry, Finn,"" Charlie‚Äôs voice pricked the silence. The back of the van was so cold, and the smell was already there‚Äîpotent, a thick, rotting decay.

‚ÄúBut you're the perfect body and shape for my father,‚Äù he said, his voice deadpan and wrong. ‚ÄúI hope this doesn't change things between us,‚Äù he whispered.

His voice was different‚Äîtaunting and cold‚Äîsending shivers down my spine.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still friends, right?‚Äù

I fucking screamed at him.

That bastard.

He played the role so well, I should have fucking applauded him.

I slammed my fists into the shutters, but the ignition came to life, and the van jerked forward, sending me stumbling back.

I dropped to my knees, choking on the stink of decay. I didn't want to look.

The light was too bright, too invasive, scorching the chill from my skin.

I stayed on my knees until the smell got so bad, I had to fucking look.

In front of me were bodies. Most of them were faceless, with no features, skin already crumbling from bones jutting out.

One of them caught my eye, lying at the bottom of the pile.

Ben. His skin was gray, dried blood staining his face, painting his clothes. 

I was already trying to roll him onto his front, so I didn't have to look at him. His eyes were open, like he was still alive.

I shoved him onto his stomach, and something sour crawled up my throat, my stomach revolting.

I thought I was seeing things. But no.

When I reached forward, my fingers touched them‚Äîthe twisted, feathery appendages protruding from twin slits cruelly sliced into a jutting spine.

I shuffled back, a cry clawing from my throat.

Wings.

They were rotten, decaying‚Äîthe wings of a bird, or something else‚Äîspliced with his flesh. I could see where his back had been cut open, all the way down his spine. Ben was dead.

His wings were dying, festering inside a body that was ice-cold and alone, where he would never be found. That thought was quick to hit me. *Just like me*.

Carly‚Äôs short brown curls were buried under another corpse, a much younger kid.

I could still see the pale blue of her coat, her yellow hat still frozen to her head.

Carly had one singular wing sticking from her back, while the rest of her rotted away.

I tripped over something‚ÄîCarly‚Äôs backpack.

I could glimpse Jason's kicks sticking out from the pile.

I couldn't look.

They had names. They were real kids. Carly. Ben. Jason.

They existed. Even if this world was so obsessed with fucking erasing them.

""Finn?"" Charlie's whisper slipped through the shutters.

I held onto his voice, willing it to be him.

Charlie.

""Do you believe in angels?‚Äù he asked me once again.

He still had that voice‚Äîthat innocent, chipper tone I fell for.

But there was an unmistakable twisting madness clinging to every word.

I didn't respond. I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

After a while, his voice stopped trying to get my attention.

I just sat, freezing cold, my arms around my knees.

I was going to fucking die.

I kept looking at the kids who vanished, their bodies twisted and contorted into a cruel fantasy. The van stopped when I was falling asleep, jerking me awake.

I heard footsteps outside. The shutters slid open, and in front of me, to my surprise, was a middle-aged woman.

Her smile was kind, despite the gleam in her eye.

She held out her arms, gesturing for me to come toward her.

‚ÄúIt's okay, honey,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúYou're okay now.‚Äù

Charlie was standing next to her, his arms folded.

‚ÄúCareful,‚Äù he muttered, nudging her. I saw his lip curl in disgust. 

Illuminated in the van‚Äôs headlights, I saw who really was; a spoiled, psychotic kid playing with his toys. 

Charlie mockingly stepped back. 

‚ÄúHe might attack you.‚Äù

Behind him stood a towering man, holding a gun pointing it between my eyes.

I had no choice, letting them pull me from the van.

The man was quick to slip a shot into the back of my neck, which turned my body to lead.

I was lifted into someone's arms. I remember they were warm.

The last thing I remember is a bright light getting closer.

I don't know how long I was out for. Long enough to get an actual, proper sleep.

When I opened my eyes, I was staring at the sun peeking through gaps in a wooden door, my head turned at an awkward angle. 

It looked like I was in some kind of farmhouse. I could see piles of hay and horse shit in the corner. I was lying on my stomach, my wrists pinned down. 

The pain crept in slowly‚Äîat first a dull thud, before slamming into me, agonizing lightning bolts striking down my spine.

So fucking painful, my vision blurred and feathered, losing focus.

I've had sensory issues since I was a kid, and I could feel the entirety of my upper back had been split open.

I could feel my own blood dripping down my skin, and something cruel and sharp forcing flaps of flesh apart. The thought of being cut open was enough to send me into fucking hysteria. I remember screaming until my throat was raw, until I  I passed out again. This time, a mercy. 

The pain wouldn't leave, pulling me into agony, and then letting me go.

When I came around for the second time, I felt the ice-cold scalpel slicing into my back.

But I didn't feel like I was cut open anymore. I felt a painful tugging when I tried to move. Stitches holding me together.

‚ÄúThat's all finished,‚Äù the man‚Äôs voice sounded. ‚ÄúThe body is almost ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut when?‚Äù

That voice sent shivers creeping down my spine.

Charlie.

‚ÄúYou said that last time, and the last three angels *died*, Dad.‚Äù I could sense his rolled eyes. ‚ÄúAdmit that you're just killing them, and you actually have no idea what you're doing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said he's ready,‚Äù the man grumbled.

‚ÄúSo, let him fly!‚Äù Charlie groaned. ‚ÄúCome on, Dad, I want to see the angel fly!‚Äù

I was aware I was gasping into the cold surface of the surgical table.

‚ÄúHis stitches are still fresh,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúWhen he's ready, you can play with him.‚Äù

I was left alone after that.

Hours.

Then, a full day.

But I wasn't hungry anymore. I was thirsty. I didn't sleep.

I was trying to find the best position to lie in (on my side) when footsteps startled me.

‚ÄúHey, Finn.‚Äù

Charlie's voice was an excited whisper. I felt his warm fingers tiptoe down my back before reaching for my restraints.

He pulled them apart, helping me up, and I immediately dragged my hand down my back, where I was sure I‚Äôd touch my ugly, protruding spine. But instead, I felt smooth skin.

Slowly, I lowered myself off the table. Charlie was holding my backpack.

‚ÄúHere!‚Äù he said excitedly, shoving it into my chest.

‚ÄúDad says I'm not allowed to let you go yet, but I'm too impatient.‚Äù His eyes never left my back.

Without responding, I took my backpack, shoved past him, and broke into a sprint.

I pushed through the doors of the farmhouse and kept running.

I expected to be grabbed and pulled back. But I wasn't. 

Charlie just stood there watching me, grinning, an inhuman grin stretched across his face. 

I didn't stop until I couldn't breathe, until I was on my knees, on some unfamiliar road in the middle of nowhere. I was picked up by a woman who offered to take me to the sheriff's station. She gave me hot tea and food, but I declined both. 

I wasn't hungry, and my body didn't feel like my own. 

When we got into town, and I was sure I knew where I was, I dived out of her car. 

I went to the restroom, pulled off my shirt, and ran my fingers down my back. 

I could *feel* them. 

Something was moving under my skin, twitching, like they were alive. 

When I gingerly touched my skin, I could feel tiny stitches all the way down my spine. 

Part of me wondered what would happen if I ripped them open. 

After a single restless night on the street, I realized I couldn't fucking do it anymore. 

I ended up asking for help when the pain in my back kept me up at night.

I could feel them physically trying to push through my skin, straining against my spine. I couldn't sleep on my back, or my side. The best sleeping position was lying on my stomach. 

Winter moved into spring, and I felt like I was dying. I couldn't eat, and I was weak. 

I think it was luck. Maybe a miracle. 

I walked into one of my old teachers. Mrs W. She didn't ask about my situation, but she did offer a place to stay. 

That was the best thing about Mrs W. 

No matter how much I knew she wanted to ask, she never invaded my privacy. She saw the scars on my back, saw me puke up everything I ate. 

But she didn't speak.

Mrs W asked me if I wanted to share anything with her, and I said, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

If anyone knew what was inside my back, I‚Äôd be sliced open again. 

I was nineteen at this point‚Äì and I was tired and in too much pain to care about accepting handouts. 

Mrs W let me sleep in her spare room. She offered me food, but I could never eat it. 

I could only drink water, and even that was hard to stomach. 

She took me to the emergency room to get my back checked out, but after I suffered a panic attack at the thought of opening up to a doctor, she promised *no hospitals*. 

The pain got worse. It fucking laughed at medication. 

It got so bad, one night, I stood on the roof of Mrs W‚Äôs house, and let the pain take over, ripping through me, until something was splitting my spine, sending me to my knees.

I could feel them coming through, breaking through my skin.

They felt wrong and awkward, like additional limbs. I panicked, and with shaking hands, forced the twitching *things* back into twin slits. 

That did relieve the pain.

I still couldn't eat or drink, but I started to feel human again. 

Mrs W offered to send me back to school, and I did. I went back to finish high school. 

The eating/drinking thing got easier. 

I think my body just got used to it. 

After school, I got into community college, and Mrs W helped me buy my first place. 

I grew up, with the gnawing feeling that something wasn't *right* with me.

The pain was still agonizing, and at times, I would have to rip open the stitches, and let them free. I've never once tried to figure them out, because I'm fucking terrified of them. 

I'm 29 now. 

I live far away from my hometown. I have a boyfriend, and an apartment, and I finally feel human again. 

Last night, I was waiting for a train home. It was freezing, and already, I could feel my back twitching, pain starting to gnaw at me. 

It's worse these days. Not just the pain. I'm sleepwalking. 

I'll find myself blocks away from my house, with no recollection of how I got there. 

I don't know why I'm no different from my teenage self. 

I still don't want to ask help, because whatever is inside me isn't fucking human. 

So, I kept my mouth shut. 

There was a homeless girl slumped in the corner of the platform. 

I've made it my goal. Whenever I see a homeless kid, I point them to the nearest shelter‚Äì and when they roll their eyes at me, I offer to take them there myself. 

I don't leave them until I know these kids are safe. Yes, they can be difficult.

They're a lot more vocal these days. Kids hate authority figures. 

Especially authority figures that failed them. 

But I want to make it clear to them that they CAN ask for them. And there IS help. 

I was already halfway across the platform when I glimpsed familiar brown curls nestled under a green beanie. 

I knew it was him. He was wearing that exact same jacket, clinging to a wider frame. He was taller, his face more matured, with a five o‚Äôclock shadow, talking loudly on an expensive phone.

I took my eyes off of the girl for one second. 

One second. 

I turned back to her, and she was gone. Just like that. 

When I searched the crowd, I caught her blonde ponytail behind her. 

A man pulling her through strangers. 

I started forwards, when someone pulled me back. 

‚ÄúNo, Finn.‚Äù Charlie's voice was in my ear, suddenly. 

‚ÄúShe has the perfect shape and body for my father,‚Äù he murmured. 

His voice kept me paralyzed, while the girl was getting further and further away, before becoming a speck, and then bleeding into nothing. 

‚ÄúI want to see you fly, Finn,‚Äù Charlie whispered. 

I twisted around, and he was gone. 

When I left the train station, sitting on a bench was his old threaded backpack. 

Nothing inside, but I know why he left it. 

He's telling me he's watching me. 

Charlie is bragging that he's taking more kids right in front of me. 

I've looked everywhere for the girl, and I can't find her. 

When I asked a group of street kids, they were defensive, clearly not trusting me, before I warned them someone was kidnapping them. 

They told me three guys, and a girl (the blonde) have all vanished. 

I asked *when*, and that's when they started getting suspicious. 

They left without telling me, and I've spent the last week looking for these kids. 

The only way I'm going to find these kids is to find the sick bastard who took me. 

Before he does to them, what he did to Ben, Carly and Jason.

At first there wasn't much interaction but over time he would start to make stupid jokes around the girls wrestling team and I would find him staring at me. Jake was popular in school but he was definitely an asshole to everyone and he didn't even try to hide it. Towards the end of my senior year he started to talk to me a bit more and I definitely noticed him staring at me during practice and around that time he added me on snapchat fast forward to September of 2024 he randomly asked me to go to a concert with him and I said yes. The concert went really really well so we kept talking after. we eventually started dating and he was so sweet but it scared me off like it felt like he was love bombing me with doing things like showing up to my house when my family went on vaca and i wasn't the only one home to put flowers and chocolates in my car while i was sleeping to surprise me but in all reality all that did was scare me it got to the point one night where i felt kinda sick i had a long day with school and work and he pushed so hard to go on a date that night then proposed to take me to a fancy restaurant which i didn't end up liking then out to a halloween corn maze and i was just so tired by the end of the night that the night day i decided to end it with him because i felt like i couldn't hold up a relationship with him. Fast forward to mid January. I missed him, I missed the way he would look at me and the sweet things he would do and I know those aren't the right reasons to get back with someone but I decided to reach out and apologize for how I ended things before.¬†

We started talking again and it was nice, then I found out he was sick. He was passing out, his blood pressure was abnormally high and his blood glucose was weird. He went to the doctor and they ran a test and discovered his liver was failing. I'm an emt so I wasn't scared by his symptoms but the way he was handling them was stressing me out. He was still doing things his doctor told him not to do like wrestling and working out. There were times when he called me that he just threw up blood or passed out and I would offer to take him to the ER and sit with him but he never wanted to go. On February 4th at 7AM I got the call from my best friend's mom that my best friend had died in the early morning. It felt like something broke at that very moment. Someone who had been my best friend for years, someone who had been with me through thick and thin died and I felt like I was drowning. for the days following that he tried to give me support but i just wanted to be left alone. he stop giving me support and i was ok with that but then valentines day happened when maddie died it felt like time stopped for me so i wasn't prepared for valentines day i didn't get us reservations anywhere or have any plans but i did make him these cute cotton round flowers i saw on tik tok. I made 11 of them and it took me almost 6 hours to finish them all. On Valentine's Day he was almost pissy at me that i didnt have any plans for us but he could have been the one to step u-p and make them since I'm dealing with grief, college and work all at once. we ended up just driving around that night not really talking, we decided to get coffee at starbucks so while we were in the drive through i was talking to him turned to make the order then look back and him and in the middle of a sentence he stopped talking he head fell back i saw his eyes rolling into his head and his arm was twitching the i started saying his name loudly and he came back into it i gave him a automation either i was going to take him to the er and be there with him or i'm taking him and dropping him off at home because i'm not spending my night dealing with that.¬†

On the way back to his house I got a call from one of my sorority sisters asking if I wanted to go out with them since they were having a galentine's day dinner and taking pictures and I said sure I'll be there in a bit. After that he was mad that I'm choosing them over him and I told him that I'm not doing that. I'm dropping him off because I don't want the responsibility of dealing with him since he's not being responsible about his condition and it's not my job to watch him.¬†

The next few days I realized I couldn't handle my own shit plus his. I don't have it in me to deal with his shit and my own shit. I'm failing two classes and I'm on academic probation with my sorority. I can't risk sleeping anymore in my academic life and personal life than I already am. I know that is selfish but I feel like I have that right to be selfish right now. On the 20th he texted me about how things with us weren't right and how he's worried so I sent him ""this I don‚Äôt really think I have it in me for a relationship run like I‚Äôm so mad and sad all the time right now and you don‚Äôt deserve it. I don‚Äôt think I can give you the things you deserve in a relationship. I think if hadn‚Äôt started this right before Reagon died things would differently but I‚Äôm barely functioning rn and I don‚Äôt want to lead you on then I crash out and ghost you again because that‚Äôs not fair. Ik this is shitty of me but i barely have enough of myself for just me and there not much of me to share anymore."" and he responded with ""are you serious, this isn't fair you're abandoning me again, if you do this there no changing it"" and i told him that i'm aware of what i'm doing and it's what i need to do for myself.¬†

I just want to know if what I did was wrong. I'm aware I probably didn't handle it the best and at this point I can barely handle anything. currently while writing this i have covid and i sinus infection. It feels like my life is in shambles and I'm not sure how to fix it. I lost my best friend, my family doesn't really do emotions and it's the first death I'm having to deal with.i‚Äôm having problems sleeping because i keep having nightmares about the way she died i just feel like shit in every way.¬†

1izxfh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1izxfh8/could_discover_the_gevi_espresso_machine_be_the/,Could Discover the Gevi Espresso Machine Be the Ultimate Home Barista Tool? A Full Review,"Using the Gevi GECME418E-U+GECGI406B-U7 espresso machine daily has been an enlightening experience for me as both a coffee enthusiast and a curious tester. This machine offers a blend of compact elegance and professional-level functionality, designed to transform your kitchen into a mini caf√©. From the first brew to the most intricate latte art, it excels in many ways but also leaves room for a few improvements.

**Brewing Performance**  
The brewing process is where this machine truly shines. Its 20-bar pressure system delivers a consistent and aromatic espresso shot, rivaling some of the best caf√© brews I‚Äôve tasted. It took me a few trials to perfect the extraction time and tamping pressure, but once dialed in, the espresso was rich and full-bodied. I even experimented with different grind settings using the integrated burr grinder, which allowed for a wide range of customization. This feature is a dream for someone like me, who enjoys alternating between espresso and Americano.

[Check Gevi GECME418E-U+GECGI406B-U7 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ckmtrl53/)

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**  
Creating silky microfoam for a latte or cappuccino is quite straightforward thanks to the powerful steam wand. I‚Äôve had my fair share of encounters with frothers that overheat milk or fail to produce the right consistency, but this machine‚Äôs wand is surprisingly advanced. It easily creates the smooth texture needed for latte art, with just the right temperature control. My kids even joined in, attempting to make hearts and swirls, though the results were more abstract than artistic!

**Features**  
This machine is packed with thoughtful features. The burr grinder includes 35 precise settings, making it easy to switch between fine espresso grounds and coarser grinds for a French press. The hot water function comes in handy for tea or a quick Americano. I also appreciated the removable drip tray, which accommodates larger mugs for those oversized coffee cravings. Another clever touch is the included accessories like the tamper, milk jug, and cleaning tools, which make the setup feel comprehensive and user-friendly.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**  
Most mornings in my home are chaotic, with everyone rushing around and plenty of background noise. That‚Äôs why I appreciated how quiet this machine is, especially when grinding beans. It doesn‚Äôt disrupt the household, even during early mornings. On the energy front, it performs admirably too, with an automatic shutoff feature that ensures no unnecessary power is consumed.

**Design & Build Quality**  
With its ivory beige finish and stainless steel accents, this espresso maker adds a touch of sophistication to the kitchen. Despite weighing 17.16 pounds, it feels sturdy yet sleek. However, I noticed the lightweight design can cause the machine to shift slightly when locking in the portafilter, requiring a bit of extra hold during setup.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**  
Cleaning is a breeze, with removable components like the drip tray and froth nozzle making routine maintenance simple. The included cleaning brush and pin are lifesavers for ensuring the grinder and nozzle remain clog-free. However, the grinder occasionally requires a gentle tap to encourage beans to move, especially with oilier roasts.

**Water Tank & Capacity**  
The water reservoir is easy to refill and holds enough for multiple shots, which is convenient for busy mornings. I found it manageable to detach and clean, though I would have appreciated a visible water level indicator for quicker checks.

**Coffee Quality**  
Taste is the ultimate test, and the Gevi machine delivers. The espresso was consistently robust and aromatic. I could taste the nuances in the beans, whether I used a light roast or something darker. Friends who visited for coffee often commented on how caf√©-like the experience felt.

**Strong Points**

* The built-in burr grinder offers exceptional customization with 35 grind settings.
* Produces caf√©-quality espresso with its 20-bar pressure.
* The steam wand creates silky microfoam effortlessly.
* Quiet operation and energy-efficient features are great for daily use.

**Areas of Concern**

* The grinder occasionally struggles with darker, oilier beans, requiring manual intervention.
* Lightweight design can cause slight movement when locking the portafilter.
* No clear water level indicator on the reservoir.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this to other super-automatic espresso machines, such as those from Breville or DeLonghi, the Gevi holds its ground remarkably well. While it lacks some of the advanced programmability of higher-end models, its price point and feature set make it a strong contender. The burr grinder and steam wand are comparable to those in machines that cost significantly more. However, competitors like Breville might offer a sturdier build and slightly quieter grinding operation.

**Bang for the Buck**  
For its price range, this machine is an excellent investment. It bridges the gap between entry-level and professional espresso makers, providing a balance of quality and affordability. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or a seasoned coffee lover, the features justify the cost, especially considering the included accessories and robust performance.

1izxfgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1izxfgy/can_the_best_wireless_earbuds_from_jbl_live_up_to/,Can the best wireless earbuds from JBL live up to expectations? A detailed review,"Using the JBL Vibe 200TWS earbuds daily has given me plenty of insight into their performance. As someone who juggles music during workouts, podcasts on commutes, and the occasional phone call, I had high hopes for these true wireless earbuds. There's a lot to like here, but a few quirks might leave some users wanting more.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about these earbuds was their sleek and pocket-friendly design. The black matte finish gives them a modern look without being too flashy. They feel lightweight, and the rounded-tip earpiece shape makes them easy to insert. The charging case is compact, slipping easily into a pocket or small bag. However, while the case feels sturdy, it doesn't scream premium quality. It's functional but a bit basic for a product in this category.

**Fit & Comfort**  
Comfort is subjective, of course, but I found these earbuds to fit well. They come with three sizes of silicone tips, so you can find the best seal for your ears. I went through all three sizes before settling on the smallest ones, which fit snugly and stayed secure even during workouts. My wife tried them briefly and found the medium tips more suitable for her ears. While they‚Äôre generally comfortable for extended wear, I did notice slight irritation after wearing them continuously for several hours.

**Battery Life & Charging**  
Battery life is one of this product's most impressive features. The earbuds themselves deliver up to 5 hours of playback on a single charge, while the case holds an additional 15 hours. This means I can go for days without needing to recharge, which is a lifesaver for someone like me who often forgets to plug things in. The quick charge feature is a nice touch‚Äî10 minutes in the case gets you about an hour of playback. However, I did wish the charging case had better visual indicators for battery levels.

**Sound Quality & Performance**  
The sound on these earbuds is, simply put, delightful. JBL's signature Deep Bass Sound delivers punchy lows without overwhelming the mids and highs. Whether I‚Äôm listening to upbeat pop tracks during workouts or calming classical music while working, the sound remains balanced and crisp. There‚Äôs no distortion even at higher volumes, which is a big plus. That said, audiophiles might find the bass slightly overpowering for certain genres. For the average user, though, the sound quality is more than adequate.

**Noise Cancellation & Ambient Mode**  
These earbuds rely on passive noise cancellation, which depends on the physical seal created by the ear tips. While this does a decent job of blocking out background noise, it's nowhere near the level of active noise cancellation. I was able to drown out the hum of a coffee shop but could still hear traffic on a busy street. They lack an ambient mode, which would have been useful for outdoor activities like jogging.

**Features**  
The JBL Vibe 200TWS has touch controls for managing playback, calls, and voice assistants. While functional, the touch controls are overly sensitive. I found myself accidentally pausing songs or skipping tracks when adjusting the earbuds. Dual Connect technology lets you use either earbud independently, which I found handy during work calls.

**Durability & Water Resistance**  
With an IPX2 rating, these earbuds are resistant to light sweat and small splashes. They‚Äôve survived a couple of gym sessions and an accidental drop into a puddle without any issues. However, they're not designed for heavy rain or intense physical activities that produce a lot of sweat.

**Warranty**  
The earbuds come with a standard one-year warranty, which is fairly typical. I haven‚Äôt had any issues requiring customer service, but it‚Äôs nice to have that safety net just in case.

**Advantages**

* The compact and lightweight design makes them portable.
* JBL Deep Bass Sound delivers rich and immersive audio quality.
* Battery life is excellent, offering up to 20 hours of combined playback.
* Dual Connect allows the use of a single earbud for calls or music.

**Negative Attributes**

* Touch controls are overly sensitive and prone to accidental activation.
* The lack of active noise cancellation might be a dealbreaker for some.
* Limited water resistance means they aren‚Äôt ideal for intense activities.

**Competitive Options**  
When comparing these earbuds to their competitors, they hold up reasonably well. For instance, the Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro offers active noise cancellation and customizable EQ settings but comes at a higher price point. Apple‚Äôs AirPods are known for their seamless integration with iPhones but lack the robust bass of the JBL Vibe 200TWS. If you‚Äôre willing to spend more, the Sony WF-1000XM4 offers better noise cancellation and sound quality. However, in the budget-friendly category, these JBL earbuds provide excellent value for their price.

**Value for Money**  
For what they offer, the JBL Vibe 200TWS earbuds are a solid investment. They might not have all the bells and whistles of high-end models, but they strike a good balance between affordability and performance. If you‚Äôre looking for reliable earbuds with great sound and long battery life, these are worth considering.

1izxcch,https://www.reddit.com/r/cabosanlucas/comments/1izxcch/cabo_guide_feb_2025/,Cabo Guide- Feb 2025,"Just went on a trip to Cabo San Lucas, and wanted to share the things that we liked and didn't like so that you can make decisions for your trip!

Some quick stats:  
\- Couple in their early 30s  
\- 4 days 5 nights  
\- Goal of trip was to relax, eat, drink and be in bed by 10  
\- Stayed in an Airbnb 10 Min walk from Medano Beach

  
Do's:  
\- Stay on the north side of the Marina near Medano beach. This area is closer to a lot more restaurants and Medano beach is much longer than the one to the south.  
\- [Milky Beach ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f3QyjdXq28W7Y5Lu7)for drinks on the beach. Each drink is around $10-12 USD and you can take them to go out on the sand. Cocktails were better than some of the other places around.  
\- The [Sandbar massages](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UHZZm9YYUdKFbDhUA): Went here twice for full body massages, they are $38 per person plus tip and overall a great experience both times. I would recommend going in the morning <11 am to avoid the heat and the music that gets pretty loud from the bars below. Bring Pesos or Dollars to tip.  
\- [Mi Casa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YmzLeEicVHstM3h26) (restaurant): Food here was great, got a Molcajete with Arrachera (steak) and it was delicious. Servers are very friendly and the ambience is awesome.  
\-[ Mother Flower](https://maps.app.goo.gl/htPxj5jK8FtpH2BM9) (Restaurant): Small spot with good food and amazing cocktails. Would go back here just for the drinks.  
\- [Tacos Lalos](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DQzLzYiEHmAaHEFB6) (Restaurant): Great casual dining spot for breakfast or lunch. No frills but the food and margs are reasonably priced.  
\- Mango on a stick and churros from beach vendors: You pay a slight premium but a fresh mango with Tajin and churros with sauce are a perfect snack for the beach. they were both $5 each when I bought them (\~100 pesos)   
\- [Bar Esquina Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z4yeBRqEnYvv1nZt8): Next to the restaurant they have their coffee shop and we got green juices/ smoothies here every day. Their bakery items were good, we got the vanilla concha which was tasty.  
\- Schedule a round trip [shuttle](https://www.cabotransfers.com/) to and from the airport: Otherwise you may be stuck getting fleeced by the people once you arrive. Plus it is kind of nice to know that you have transportation covered and don't have to worry about planning it. Bring some cash to tip.  
\-Cabo Treasure (Souvenirs): The place was reasonable in price and the lady working there was very nice. The blown glass here is all from Guadalajara and handmade.

  
Dont's:  
\-  buy souvenirs from vendors walking the beach. They are grossly overpriced and if you show any bit of interest they will continue to try to sell them to you. Would recommend going into town and going to some of the smaller souvenir shops and haggling there.  
\- [La Lupita](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SF3V5d7H9ZX9LKYE9) (Restaurant): Overall the vibes are good here but I was not super impressed with the tacos. They have their basic menu and then mostly specialty tacos but I didnt love any of the specialty ones. My favorite was the Al Pastor and that was the cheapest of the ones I got. Also music can be very loud if they have a live band  
\- [Bar Esquina ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rQdQCpHdTy6bSHQf6)(restaurant): Went here for dinner and it was by far the most expensive food we had and honestly it wasn't that great. It is italian/american and the portions were small, food was good but not worth the price. The vibes were nice though. 

  
Other tips:  
\- Staying in an airbnb was nice and nearly the same price as a hotel (or cheaper)  
\- Have some pesos on hand to tip (im sure dollars work too in most places) but for smaller establishments, cash is a lot easier to tip with  
\- Use a debit card that doesn't charge foreign/atm fees (Charles Schwab or Fidelity are 2 good ones)  
\- Always pay in Pesos when using a credit card as you will mostly likely get a better exchange rate than if they do the conversion   
\- Wouldn't recommend drinking tap water. Safe to brush your teeth and stuff but not for consumption. ",5,1740709855.0,cabosanlucas,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I‚Äôm from Peru, and my brother started a business by creating his own Peruvian coffee brand. Now, he has four different types of coffee.



I‚Äôve been thinking about the future because one day, I‚Äôd love to work in Bangkok as a digital nomad (I‚Äôm a graphic designer). This made me wonder‚Äîwhat if I opened a coffee shop in Bangkok, importing my brother‚Äôs coffee brand? I know this is just an idea that popped into my head, but I love design, and I‚Äôve noticed that brands in Thailand are so well executed.



So, my question is: **Has anyone started a business in Bangkok as a foreigner? How did you do it?**



I saw that a Thai actor Sky Wongravee (IG: u/burnt.bkk) has his own sandwich brand, and the branding looks bold and solid! So, instead of starting from scratch, I was wondering‚Äî**is it possible to buy the operating rights of an already established franchise and start from there? (this would be option2)**



If this is possible, would I need a work visa for it?



I have tons of questions in my mind, but for now, I‚Äôd love to hear from people with experience. I really like the idea of showcasing how amazing Peruvian coffee is!
