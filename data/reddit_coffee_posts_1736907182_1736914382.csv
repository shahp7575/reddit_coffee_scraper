I have a 10 month old black cat who's too smart for his own good. He can open doors, get into cabinets, open up my coffee maker (which I don't know how he's doing it), and has opened my freezer and fridge, which quite literally caused me to have a mental breakdown. 

I'm a new cat owner, I got him in August and he was fine then. But, he has some behavioral problems I can't seem to correct. I've only ever had dogs so any help would be appreciated. 

I've curbed the opening cabinets/freezer and fridge by putting locks on them, but I can't really do anything about my other appliances so I feel like I need to train him to stay off the counter, what would be the best way to go about that? He enjoys eating tinfoil (it's actually a problem).

Do cats need routine? I never had an animal who has, so maybe that could help? Maybe even any toy recommendations to keep him more occupied? I play with him all the time, but maybe there's more I could be doing. 

I love my cat and I just want him to be happy. I would appreciate any advice",1,1736914303.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

My wife and I have been together for 6 years, married for 2.5. 18 months ago we had a son. He‚Äôs my everything. My life revolves around him, but my marriage is totally imploding. Too many fights, too many awful exchanges of names and insults, too many things broken, too many times the rings have been taken off and thrown at me. I have not been the most loving husband since our son showed up. I‚Äôve tried, keep trying, but the constant disappointment and anger I feel from her‚Äîeven though I pay for our lives and am an incredible father, working from home to be able to split the childcare 50/50‚Äì has left me angry, bitter and a totally unrecognizable version of myself. I hate my life. Every day starts in the spare room with a big sigh, a few dark thoughts and then coffee. I feel trapped. I want my marriage to work but I‚Äôm starting to really hate my wife. She‚Äôs told me she hates me I don‚Äôt even know how many times. It feels fucked. Toxic. Painful. Occasionally we can put our shit aside and really enjoy ourselves, but it only lasts a few days before we‚Äôre at each others throats again. It‚Äôs relentless and exhausting. It all feels so heavy. 

The idea of being a single parent right now sounds incredible and peaceful and very appealing. But when I think about the logistics and the reality of that, I feel so sad and overwhelmed, then I don‚Äôt want to think about it. I convince myself it‚Äôs gotta work somehow. We have to figure it out. So I apologise for my part in our fights, but she just stays mad at me, and her moods create such a hostile environment that I hate living in. 

Single dads out there, does this sound familiar? Was getting out the right call? Do you have regrets? What was it like? I feel so much guilt that it‚Äôs not working. I don‚Äôt want my son to go through this. And I don‚Äôt want my wife and I to go through this. But I can‚Äôt imagine going on like this much longer. We‚Äôve done therapy, and it‚Äôs not worked.

I don't know what to make of our break up. I feel so lost and my abandonment issues are sky rocketing like crazy. I apologize in advance if this sounds messy I was never good at organizing my thoughts or words. This is going to be long.
This information may be excessive  but useful.  We currently still live together in a 1 bedroom 1 bath apartment because we have approx. 4 months left on our lease. My name is on the lease but he pays the bill including electricity. I pay for groceries and household/hygiene items.

Onto the details of our relationship/breakup/us.
 I have a lot of abandonment issues, undiagnosed bpd/adhd and lost of mood swings, anxiety and depression .
Ex bf has been in prison most of his life, serving three sentences since he was 19 on and off until he was 34. The last time was 5 years and most of it in isolation. This has led to him being emotionally closed off and he has little to no communication skills relationship wise. 
We are both very reactive people and have anger issues.
We argue a lot over anything and everything. The way eggs are made, the tone of his voice, me getting offended over something stupid, anything. 
A lot of the big ones were usually about me asking for more romance, or reciprocation, being disappointed over lack of dates or compliments. In short, the big ones were always about my standards and expectations of him as my partner. Which is the reason why we've broken up. 
I guess I was asking too much of him and he got tired of me being disappointed in him. I didn't ask for much, just for him to stop blowing up and getting frustrated over my emotions or the times I wanted to talk to him about something that bothered me. Every time I would mention something that bothered me he would get so frustrated and annoyed and then I would cry because it was so hard to get him to hear me out. I would have to fight tooth and nail just so he could understand my emotions and my side. I would always tell him if you cared you would actually talk things out with me or someone that loves me wouldn't act so short tempered over my feelings. Every time he hurt my feelings it was like an annoyance to him. So he got tired of me throwing that in his face I guess.
I'm really good at understanding and communicating. If someone said to me ""hey I didn't like what you said"" or ""I feel hurt when you did this"" i would be all ears and apologize and then ask how I could avoid doing that to prevent it in the future. And I tried explaining that to him but he would always say I don't understand so I can't apologize or I don't know how to understand feelings so I don't know where you're coming from.
After so many times explaining so many ways he was making some progress and he would catch himself sometimes when he would start to get frustrated. We would have some successes and get on the same page miraculously. 
Then came the ""if he wanted to he would"" arguments. Compliments, flowers, dates; whenever he wouldn't do these gestures I would tell him why do I have to ask you should be more interested in knowing how to romance me. Arguments over that too until I finally understood he wasn't a mind reader and apologized on my own and told him what I liked. He never asked me though which left some resentment still. I was always speaking up about what I liked and making it obvious for him. And he still couldn't keep up with that.
He rarely talked to me about what I liked while I was always asking him a ton of questions about himself or what food he likes how he likes his coffee and if there's anything I can do for him to let me know. I was so in love I was always willing to do anything for him. Meanwhile he was never attentive with me. His idea of what I should be happy with was bills paid, car taken care of and we want for nothing. It's not that I don't appreciate that I do I just wanted him to speak my love language and show that he loved me.
He is also very quiet and doesn't conversate much which bothered me because I always had tons to say and talk to him about but he would just reply short leaving me to make all the conversation. Another thing we argued about.
I guess finally all this got to be too much for him and about a week ago during our arguments he finally admitted he was burnt out. That he had too much on his plate to be worrying about our arguing. (He works nightshift four sometimes 6 days a week 6 to 5 less on the 5th and 6th day) and he has Court fees and parole to worry about. 
He said he was just exhausted over the arguing and I would tell him they don't have to be arguments they could be simple conversations calm ones and he just said they were over the same things that he was never going to be enough  for me. That I don't have patience for the way he is since he has never opened up emotionally or had relationship experience this way. Has never had a healthy relationship. He said he needed space to figure things out and I said okay how long he said a week. He Then proceeded to treat it like a break, he wouldn't text or talk to me no kissing no hugging no anything. He eventually said I love you less and less. It broke my heart, did I misunderstand? Space is just a break from the arguing and some alone time. He wouldn't text me good morning like he usually did and I asked him so what kind of space did you want? He just said he already told me space like a week where he doesn't focus on the relationship so I said you must don't want the pressure of our relationship? That sounds like you don't want to be in a relationship.
I kind of hate myself this time around because I would cry and then try and talk to him about what was going to happen that I didn't want us to end. He was just so distant and cold I couldn't believe this was just space. To me it was like soft launching a break up. Then I couldn't take it anymore after being told he didn't know what he wanted and if he wanted this so I said he would have to move to the living room and we need to start figuring out how we are going to divide the apartment and chores etc he just agreed calmly and this made me so sad and upset... he said he didnt think asking for space was going to lead to this. He said that I kept asking for too much.
It's been hell for me. I asked him if he loved me less he said yeah.
Today he told me there was a 60/40 chance he was going to break up because he just wanted space and have a clear mind and I didn't give him enough time. I feel like I ruined it.  I don't know how to function meanwhile he acts just fine and talks to me normal. When he leaves for work he hugs me good bye, still texts me on his break and says good morning and good night. I'm so broken and torn and a part of me still has hope.",1,1736913334.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

1i1oxk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i1oxk7/how_to_move_forward_from_here_cheated_on_my_best/,How to move forward from here - cheated on my best friend/(ex)-partner of 10 years. Please read full story before commenting. ,"There is alot to unpack in this, and I cannot give a TLDR as it would not do the story justice. 

My (recently-ex) partner and I seperated 10 days ago. We had dated for just above 10 years from when we were 17 until 27. She was my first proper partner, my first love, the person I lost my virginity to and vice-versa for her. She is my best friend. On all accounts she is a lovely human being - she is a kind, attractive, thoughtful, loyal and hard working. I, on the other hand, may appear outwardly confident, able to make people like me, but (as you will see and on reflection) have ashamedly become quite a cowardly and entitled individual who has taken my lovely ex-partner for granted. There is alot of shame that I have begun harbouring about this. The one positive thing I can hold onto is that I hope that I am on the beginning of a long and humbling journey of self-reflection, learning and healing to become a much better person. 

At the start of this year we moved in together. The first few months were good, but over time things became stale as a result of (on reflection now, but not something I really recognised at the time) us both not putting in a huge amount of effort. This led to feelings of disconnect. It doesn't help that we don't have a whole lot of interests that we share and that we do very different jobs in very different fields, which can make conversation quite stale. Both of us can sometimes struggle to express her concerns and wants. There is also an element of me having unreastic expectations about a long-term relationship. I have also grappled for a long time with the feeling that there is more out there that I haven't explored - other people that I could potentially be with, experiences I could have (solo travelling, etc.). These are not strong feelings, but seem to emerge when there are issues in our relationship and I do not feel deeply connected with my partner. I believe these feelings are really distractions that I have allowed to surface and somehow make me feel okay about not putting in effort. I am not saying this is okay, but just trying to reflect on my thought processes. 

In October we went on an overseas holiday for several weeks. I found myself feeling distant and disconnected from my partner (though I still have not gotten to the bottom of why - this will be something to address through reflection). Even though the place was beautiful and my partner was only kind to me, I couldn't shake this feeling that something was wrong. It plagued me for the whole two weeks. On the last night we had an open conversation and agreed we both needed to put in more effort. Once the holiday finished she then went on a further 3 week holiday overseas while I returned home. The feelings of disconnection did not disappate and we only rarely talked while she was overseas.  

In December I went on an overseas holiday for 3 weeks by myself. As soon as I got there I felt 'free' but also a little bit lonely as so put myself out to meet as many people as possible. At the end of the first week I met a female traveller. I felt a shallow connection with this person. I had a lot of points at which I could have made the right decision (walk away and stop speaking with her) but I was cowardly and weak and, ultimately, was unfaithful to my long-term ex-partner, both physically (including having sex with her once) and emotionally with this new person over the course of a week. While I did tell the person that I no longer wanted to have any sort of physical intimacy with her afterwards, I did continue to speak to her for a week or two afterwards. This was a continuation of the cheating. After the window period for an STI test elapsed I got an STI test and as it turns out I had contracted a treatable STI which I immediately sought medicine for. The doctor I saw advised that it would cure the STI within 5 days. This was 4 days before I returned home.

In the days before returning home after the holiday I came up with a deceptive lie to tell my partner that I had met someone and had a connection with them but that nothing physical had happened. I would also have to avoid being intimate with her until I had a negative STI test. Somehow in my (twisted) mind, at the time, this was okay. I planned to tell her after Christmas and the New Year. To be clear (on reflection), while I justified this at the time as sparing her the pain of hearing what I had done, this was actually another moment of self-preservation where I put my selfish want to keep my long-term partner in my life above her right to know what was best for her, in terms of who she was with.

My long-term ex-partner is a very perceptive individual and obviously knew something was wrong by how I was acting when I returned (not being intimate, being distant, etc.). I was cagey and fearful of losing her if I told her the truth but I also knew deep down how horrible the actions that I done were. She has never done this in the 10 years we were together, but on the day I returned she looked through my phone and found some messages between me and the person I cheated on her with. She confronted me and I told her the deceptive lie outlined above. She accepted my lie (though, deep down, I think she harboured a fear that she did not want to address that perhaps more had happened). The next day I sought out an STI test which was negative. This initially boosted the cowardly part of me, to think that I had ultimately gotten away with it by giving her the lie and that there was no realistic chance I could pass on the STI. After this, we were intimate.

However, after a week or so the guilt that there may be a miniscule chance that I could have given her the STI (essentially there is always a tiny, tiny chance that you could even with treatment). This STI is one that usually does not have symptoms but can occassionally cause fertility issues in women. Eventually the will that she needed to know about it so she could get tested and the general guilt that I was not telling her the full story began to overrun me and, on the 2nd of January, I confessed to her. 

Of course, this crushed her and made me feel like the lowest piece of scum. I saw her self-esteem dissipate before my eyes. Her cycle over the next few hours between anger, despaire, sadness and fear from her made me feel like a monster. I broke my best friend, my lovely partner who had done nothing but be kind to me.  

We had several days apart to think and I encouraged her to speak with her friends and seek the support she needed. We then met again and mutually agreed that because of my actions, the relationship could no longer work. We both said that a sick part of us wanted the relationship to continue to work, for her to forgive me and for us to move forward, but that it wasn't the right course. I admitted that ultimately if she took me back straight away that (as much as I don't want it to be true and hate myself for this, but was trying to be reflective and honest) I could potentially do it again in a couple of years as I would have suffered no consequences. This was difficult to admit but a truthful reflection on how far I have fallen. From there we decided to go no contact for 3 months and then to have a coffee somewhere. That was 10 days ago.  

In retrospect all my actions were nothing short of cowardly and disgusting. I treated my ex-partner with no respect. I wouldn't wish what I did to her on my worst enemy, let alone someone as kind and loyal as my ex-partner. Despite the pre-existing issues in our relationship, my actions overseas were a reflection of only me and my deep insecurities and selfishness. 

I have recently started therapy to hopefully get to the bottom of why I did these things and will stick at it until I can understand why and prevent it from ever happening again with any future partner or if by some miricle down the path where we reconnect. I feel like a lost puppy who is only now starting to grasp the gravity of how incredibly destructive cheating is and how much of a truly selfish endeavour it is. I put the worst parts of me above your partner, destroying her self esteem and creating deepy trust issues for my own fleeting enjoyment/validation, which quickly crumbled into guilt and despair. On reflection I am horrified that I did that to my partner and almost wonder if it was someone else who did this and not me. Every day my brain has been thinking, this couldn't have been me could it? And then the tidal wave of realisation hits that all along it was me making these terrible decisions.

There is alot to handle here - the loss of my 10 year ex-partner, trying to learn from and deal with the fact that I cheated on her and ensure it never happens again in any future relationship, moving out from our shared home, the loss of many of our mutual friends. 

I feel entirely broken, guilty and distraught. 

I miss her immensly but know that I cannot reach out to her as I am, in my current state, destructive to her. I also feel that in order to change I may have to lose her from my life. Actions have consequences, and losing her might be the product of that. 

I do have a supportive group of friends, who have all committed to helping me do better. 

Ultimately, I have to do that myself though. 

So far I have: 

1. Gone no contact with my ex-partner 

2. Started the long road of therapy in understanding what led to me doing that

3. Started journalling several times a day and reflecting on things. This is something I wish I had've done months ago as it has given me so much gratitude for the people around me and for what a lovely relationship I had. 

I would appreciate any other suggestions on how to go forward with this. 

If all you have to say is negative things to me also, I will also take it. I appreciate that alot of people in this sub may have been hurt by cheating. Your personal experiences and reminders help me understand how important it is to never cross that line ever again (emotionally or physically).  ",1,1736913169.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can‚Äôt help but feel empty I guess. Let‚Äôs fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I‚Äôm a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can‚Äôt sing.

I‚Äôm love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Want to come over for a drink? Maybe we can talk about the above stuff. Some things I didn‚Äôt mention. Let me know you and you know me and we‚Äôll see where it goes.

The foundation of this business is a coffee shop (yes, there are many of them, but I feel like I‚Äôve come up with something new).

Option 1: Takeaway-only coffee shop
Description:

The takeaway-only coffee shop focuses on speed and convenience. The main concept is ordering coffee through a Telegram bot (or an app in the future) and picking it up quickly through a locker system. The space is small, around 12-15 m¬≤, without seating or relaxation areas. Unique Selling Point (USP): the ability to order coffee in advance and pick it up as quickly as possible. (Also the idea is solving the problem of long lines)

Ordering process:

The customer accesses the Telegram bot (or app) and selects their drink.
They specify preferences (e.g., syrup, sugar) from the available options. Inventory is tracked in the system.
They choose the time: ""by a specific time"" or ""as soon as possible.""
Once the order is ready, the customer receives a notification with the locker number and a one-time code or uses an RFID card.
Pickup system:

Locker system: small lockers with dual-side access. The barista places the order inside from one side, and the customer retrieves it from the other.
Locker operation:
One-time code: customers receive a code, enter it on the panel, and select their locker number.
RFID card: customers receive a card during their first order, register it in the app, and use it to open the locker.

Option 2: Coffee shop with seating and takeaway system
Description:

This coffee shop combines a classic setup with a takeaway system. The venue includes tables, chairs, and relaxation areas for customers who prefer to enjoy their coffee on-site. At the same time, a quick order pickup system via lockers is maintained.

Ordering process:

Takeaway: customers order coffee through a Telegram bot or app, as described in Option 1.
On-site: customers order at the counter or via the app.
Pickup system:

Takeaway: lockers operate using one-time codes or RFID cards.
On-site: customers receive their coffee directly at the counter.",0,1736912890.0,smallbusiness,4,0.5,False
1i1oubw,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1i1oubw/am_i_reasonable_in_asking_a_bachelorette_party_to/,Am I reasonable in asking a bachelorette party to split meals evenly?,"So I am a co maid of honor for my best friend‚Äôs wedding. We are going on a trip for a long weekend for her bachelorette party. I recently sent out a pretty detailed budget for activities, meals, etc. I‚Äôve tried to keep it super low as I‚Äôm not exactly flush right now. We have one big activity on a boat that is $135 but the rest of the planned activities are exploring, going ti the beach, etc. Aka free lol. 

I spoke with the other co maid of honor and the bride and we made the decision that we would split meals evenly to avoid chaos, having to keep track at every meal, and to keep things cut and dry. We‚Äôd take turns putting down a card each day and everyone would pay that person the same amount. As for bars and clubs though, everyone pays for what they get. 

One of the brides maids is really strict about money so I kind of expected her to say something. She literally berated my friend and I when we invited her to go to Starbucks with us once since we could just make coffee at home. (This wouldn‚Äôt normally annoy me this much but this girl has millions of dollars in a trust fund) She insisted that she would keep track of what each of us spends on meals and that we can all use Splitwise to calculate it after every meal. I don‚Äôt know how to respond and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable tasking one person with keeping track of all expenses.. I sent them the budget way in advance since it is 100% their right to know and plan accordingly, but do I need to give into what this girl wants? Am I being a jerk for just wanting to ignore it and go with the plan I had talked out and thought about after weighing the pros and cons? This seemed like the right group to ask.

1i1otyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i1otyw/im_so_confused_over_my_breakup/,I'm so confused over my breakup,"I 29F and ex 36M were together for a year. I don't know what to make of our break up. I feel so lost and my abandonment issues are sky rocketing like crazy. I apologize in advance if this sounds messy I was never good at organizing my thoughts or words. This is going to be long.
This information may be excessive  but useful.  We currently still live together in a 1 bedroom 1 bath apartment because we have approx. 4 months left on our lease. My name is on the lease but he pays the bill including electricity. I pay for groceries and household/hygiene items.

Onto the details of our relationship/breakup/us.
 I have a lot of abandonment issues, undiagnosed bpd/adhd and lost of mood swings, anxiety and depression .
Ex bf has been in prison most of his life, serving three sentences since he was 19 on and off until he was 34. The last time was 5 years and most of it in isolation. This has led to him being emotionally closed off and he has little to no communication skills relationship wise. 
We are both very reactive people and have anger issues.
We argue a lot over anything and everything. The way eggs are made, the tone of his voice, me getting offended over something stupid, anything. 
A lot of the big ones were usually about me asking for more romance, or reciprocation, being disappointed over lack of dates or compliments. In short, the big ones were always about my standards and expectations of him as my partner. Which is the reason why we've broken up. 
I guess I was asking too much of him and he got tired of me being disappointed in him. I didn't ask for much, just for him to stop blowing up and getting frustrated over my emotions or the times I wanted to talk to him about something that bothered me. Every time I would mention something that bothered me he would get so frustrated and annoyed and then I would cry because it was so hard to get him to hear me out. I would have to fight tooth and nail just so he could understand my emotions and my side. I would always tell him if you cared you would actually talk things out with me or someone that loves me wouldn't act so short tempered over my feelings. Every time he hurt my feelings it was like an annoyance to him. So he got tired of me throwing that in his face I guess.
I'm really good at understanding and communicating. If someone said to me ""hey I didn't like what you said"" or ""I feel hurt when you did this"" i would be all ears and apologize and then ask how I could avoid doing that to prevent it in the future. And I tried explaining that to him but he would always say I don't understand so I can't apologize or I don't know how to understand feelings so I don't know where you're coming from.
After so many times explaining so many ways he was making some progress and he would catch himself sometimes when he would start to get frustrated. We would have some successes and get on the same page miraculously. 
Then came the ""if he wanted to he would"" arguments. Compliments, flowers, dates; whenever he wouldn't do these gestures I would tell him why do I have to ask you should be more interested in knowing how to romance me. Arguments over that too until I finally understood he wasn't a mind reader and apologized on my own and told him what I liked. He never asked me though which left some resentment still. I was always speaking up about what I liked and making it obvious for him. And he still couldn't keep up with that.
He rarely talked to me about what I liked while I was always asking him a ton of questions about himself or what food he likes how he likes his coffee and if there's anything I can do for him to let me know. I was so in love I was always willing to do anything for him. Meanwhile he was never attentive with me. His idea of what I should be happy with was bills paid, car taken care of and we want for nothing. It's not that I don't appreciate that I do I just wanted him to speak my love language and show that he loved me.
He is also very quiet and doesn't conversate much which bothered me because I always had tons to say and talk to him about but he would just reply short leaving me to make all the conversation. Another thing we argued about.
I guess finally all this got to be too much for him and about a week ago during our arguments he finally admitted he was burnt out. That he had too much on his plate to be worrying about our arguing. (He works nightshift four sometimes 6 days a week 6 to 5 less on the 5th and 6th day) and he has Court fees and parole to worry about. 
He said he was just exhausted over the arguing and I would tell him they don't have to be arguments they could be simple conversations calm ones and he just said they were over the same things that he was never going to be enough  for me. That I don't have patience for the way he is since he has never opened up emotionally or had relationship experience this way. Has never had a healthy relationship. He said he needed space to figure things out and I said okay how long he said a week. He Then proceeded to treat it like a break, he wouldn't text or talk to me no kissing no hugging no anything. He eventually said I love you less and less. It broke my heart, did I misunderstand? Space is just a break from the arguing and some alone time. He wouldn't text me good morning like he usually did and I asked him so what kind of space did you want? He just said he already told me space like a week where he doesn't focus on the relationship so I said you must don't want the pressure of our relationship? That sounds like you don't want to be in a relationship.
I kind of hate myself this time around because I would cry and then try and talk to him about what was going to happen that I didn't want us to end. He was just so distant and cold I couldn't believe this was just space. To me it was like soft launching a break up. Then I couldn't take it anymore after being told he didn't know what he wanted and if he wanted this so I said he would have to move to the living room and we need to start figuring out how we are going to divide the apartment and chores etc he just agreed calmly and this made me so sad and upset... he said he didnt think asking for space was going to lead to this. He said that I kept asking for too much.
It's been hell for me. I don't know how to function meanwhile he acts just fine and talks to me normal. When he leaves for work he hugs me good bye, still texts me on his break and says good morning and good night... I just want us back. I want him back. I don't know what to do.

1i1otmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i1otmh/i_fell_madly_in_love_with_a_committed_person_and/,I fell madly in love with a committed person and now my brain is shattered after they left. But they have now came back in some capacity and my life is going to shit knowing that I can't still have them.,"I was promoted to a Team Lead position in the mid of December '23. Before becoming a Team Lead, I did train a batch of employees on the job basics. There was a guy named Bill (Not sharing his real name) in the training. I trained that person as well and he held me in high regards. He was so impressed with the job that he also brought his two sisters, two cousins and his wife to the office as well. He put in a really good word for me in front of them and told them how I had trained him so they already had a good image of me.

Fast forward the new batch of employees with his sisters also passed. One of his sisters caught my eye a bit. She looked pretty. I kept it to myself. Even after becoming the team lead. Me, him and his whole family had lunch together. I tried to talk to his sister Anna, as much as I can. His other sister was Sarah who was a few years younger then Anna. Anna was the one that caught my eye. She initially texted me for general work related queries.

I started to text her a bit as well. I liked her vibe. I was a bit tensed for not being recognized by the manager. She was a good listener and lent me a good ear every now and then and then also gave me good pieces of advice every now and then. We started texting each other more casually. She shared some of her concerns with me as well. I felt good that she did. I also advised, recommended and supported her in her endeavours.

One day she said that she wanted us to act formally on the floor and casually on the chat only. I didn't like that. I got defensive and said, I don't usually talk so casually in the office with you either. We had a small fight in me becoming a bit cold. She said that we will resolve the matter the next day over a cup of tea. I said okay. But I was still cold and the next day, I gave her a cold shoulder. She couldn't really bear it and went outside the office to it's entrance door. I thought I had gone too far and went after her. When I reached the gate. There are steps there. She was sitting on the steps. I asked her what was the issue. She said, don't you know what is the issue?! I said I really don't. She started crying. I was taken aback. I was amazed at the fact that someone can cry for me as well. I told her that we can go upstairs for tea. But she didn't come upstairs. All the time, I kept wondering to myself that can I hold such a value for someone that they will start to cry if I don't talk to them. My shift ended, her shift would end 2 hours after mine. Now she was giving me a cold shoulder. I beared with it. I stood back half an hour, 1 hour, 1 and half hour. Then I said, can we talk? She came outside. I told her how I only stayed around to make sure she was okay and to apologize for making her cry. On that day, something changed for the both of us. A little spark was ignited.

We started to act more and more causally with each other in office. We went on breaks together. We had food together and tea breaks together as well. We became fond of each other. She liked the way that I treated all the ladies in the office with respect. I loved the way that she radiated everyone around her with her energy. We used to text each other 4-5 or some days 6 hours as well.

One day, while we were casually texting, I found out that she was committed to someone by her family. She told me how she really didn't want it but that is how it was. She was committed to marry a close relative by her parents and she had agreed to it as well. She had already also signed an agreement which officially meant that she was going to marry that person in near future.

I asked her how she felt about the guy and she told me that she didn't like him much. He was boring and didn't really make things exciting. She really despised going out with him anywhere and didn't really see a life ahead with him. I did understand the fact that she was committed to someone and I wanted to respect it as well.

She soon started sharing with me about how controlling that person was. How he would snap if she would not respond to him in a few minutes or if she missed his calls. She started to grow more and more fond of me. She made comments that you usually make when you are really interested in someone and called me a person who held a ""Special Place"" in her life. She also used to say stuff like how would she be able to forget me. She also used to say that she cried the night before knowing that nothing can be changed in her life and she couldn't be detached from the person she was going to end up with because of the family pressures. She used to literally cry every night as per her. One day she was very upset, she asked how she can spend a life with a person who doesn't even respect her. I asked her about the whole thing but she said that she will share her story when she comes to the office. We went for tea and she shared her story with me. I told her to sit down firmly with her husband to be and have a word about how she deserves respect and how him not giving it to her is affecting her mentally. She said that if she does have a word with him regarding it, he might hold a grudge with her after she goes to live with him. I told her to have a word still. I told her to have a word with him in a civil manner. All this while though, she was saying all the stuff to me like how she wanted to be with me 24/7 and how she wanted me to do everything with her, having food with her, having tea with her, sitting right next to her and me making lonnnnng conversations with her. I was also dumbfounded and praised her smile, her looks, her character and her demeanor. She apologized when I made a mistake and I apologized when she made a mistake. She would become angry with me if she would find out that I was late to work and I wasn't able to do much work because of her being around. It was beautiful and exhilarating. We would talk for hours and still felt like we had a lot more to say.

She would cry the nights and say if she left the guy, who would take her. She was 26 and her parents didn't have enough money for dowry and people generally demand dowry. She told me how her parents were in sho much debt. I couldn't say much because I wanted to respect the document that she signed which said that she would marry that person. I was afraid that she already has a lot on her plate at that time. I didn't want myself to add on top of her problems. I told her how it was going to be fine and how God will help her and all that. I did have that spark for her but I didn't want it to take over my judgement. And besides, I didn't have so much feelings for her at that time to begin with.

She, for the first time, added a WhatsApp story as to how God makes plans for people and the people have to wait to see the beauty in his plans and all that. Before adding the story she had cried a lot, by saying how nothing can happen.

She had a word with her in laws to be, not directly with her husband to be. They agreed to have a word with her husband to be and she felt a bit of a comfort. I felt a bit bad in my heart at that time though. Like I had lost the opportunity at something. But I kept it to myself and felt happy for her in front of her.

We kept being friends. She still shared her insights with me. She them one day shared how she had cried a lot again because of what her husband to be said to her. She went ahead and cried a lot in front of her sister. Then she also told me how he had disrespected her. I felt shitty to myself thinking that I could've ultimately have changed her mind back then when she was deciding to end it all with him. I felt myself to be responsible for some of the pain now that she was getting. I started to take more care of her. I started to bring her more things to eat. I started to bring her the things of her choice. Her happiness started to bring me joy. Seeing her happy made me happy.

She one day said to me that she didn't want me to get too attached to her. She told me that she had to leave one day as it was inevitable. I confessed to her about my feeling partially. We still had a back and forth. We always went everywhere together. She always sat right besides me. We would talk for hours in office. I started to love to eat whatever she did. I started to love to do whatever she did. I would go ahead and make coffee for her which we both had.

All this while, her husband to be kept having at her with his attitude issues and she kept telling me how she was bothered. One day, I confessed that I was madly in love with her. She told me how it was so difficult for her to change her decision because of the person that was selected for her was her family's choice. I proposed to her and told her that she could have me as her partner. I didn't have anything too special to offer but I could give her a life where she would be loved unconditionally. I told her how I would do 99% of the work if she was just willing to put 1% of effort. She said that she would think of something.

Then after three to four days, she told me, her parents weren't agreeing to it because they thought it was sinful to breach the contract. She just told me how nothing could be done. At this time I was so attached to her, that if she was sick, I would get uncomfortable and would want to ease her pain. I couldn't go a day without asking if she was doing okay. She told me to care less for her as she would leave and I would be terribly heartbroken but she herself couldn't move away from me.

In the ending days, after 8-9 months of this rollercoaster ride, I sorta accepted the fact that that she would leave. I just wanted to spend as much time with her as possible before she went away. We had half days together. When had breaks together. I asked her about her preparations. I told her how I cried a lot in the nights just thinking that we wouldn't end up together. She apologized constantly. She did say that she didn't think that the marriage would last long. She acted like being unphased in front of me but some employee reported to have seen her crying after leaving from a break with me.

The fateful day came. It was her wedding day. I went to it in order to grasp the reality that she was gonna leave so I should go to her wedding in order to see her for a last time. I couldn't stomach it all. But ultimately she got married...

I went into anxiety. I cried every night wondering where she would be and how she would be. I wanted to text her but how could have I. I cried and I cried. I felt so gloomy. I couldn't get anything done. Two weeks of excessive crying had passed. Third week, I go to office and it turns outs she didn't resign and came back.

She came back to be very happy. All the while I had gone through shit for her. She was normal with me but I couldn't talk to her. She felt uncomfortable. She had admitted to my pain and told me how she told me that we should distance before she was going. Well knowing the fact that she didn't want to distance herself from me at that time. I told her how she I felt. She told me to get in touch with a psychiatrist.

She is a completely changed person now. She wants to stay friends with me but she doesn't want to consider the fact that we had something. She is negating all of it. This is making me suffer more and more. She used to sit right next to me but now she has moved to a completely different place. Everyone in office is pitying my situation and telling me to calm down. But how can I? She is here! I can't talk to her. I can't be with her. She doesn't want to admit that we had that time. And now she has moved away as well.

I feel shitty everyday. So much so that my loved ones are worried about me. I don't want to forget her. I don't want her thoughts to leave my mind. I don't want to forget her face. I don't want to forget her smile. I just don't know what to do. Everyone is telling me to ignore and ditch her from my mind but it is not possible for me to do that. Not with her being here in the office. I tried to apply to some different places but the job market is doing badly and I am not able to go anywhere else. And the truth is, I don't want to go anywhere else until she is here. I am in so much pain. Soooooooo much pain. I cry myself to sleep at nights and when I wake up, I keep thinking about her. I don't find semblance in anyone else. I can't get in touch with a different girl at this time either. My mind is not working. How can I bring myself to peace? I usually go begging to her to talk to me. But she is concerned about her image in office now that she is married so she wants to keep a low profile. But I am suffering! I don't know what to do. I am in so much pain. So mmuuuuuuuccccchhhhhh pain. I need help but everyone will say to leave her thoughts out of my mind. I can't. I don't want to. My mind is messed up. What should I do? I'm in so much pain. I didn't know it would hurt this much.",1,1736912813.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Achieving a dazzling, bright smile through teeth whitening is an exciting moment for many people. However, the burning question that follows is often about maintaining those pearly whites, especially when it comes to your daily coffee ritual. Whether you've just completed an in-office professional whitening treatment or used an at-home whitening kit, understanding how to care for your newly brightened smile is crucial.

Understanding Teeth Whitening and Coffee Consumption

After investing time and money into teeth whitening, it's natural to be concerned about preserving your results. Coffee is notorious for staining teeth, which makes the post-whitening period particularly sensitive. Dental professionals typically recommend a **careful approach to coffee consumption** immediately after teeth whitening to maintain your bright smile.

Why Coffee Can Be Problematic After Teeth Whitening

Teeth whitening temporarily makes your tooth enamel more porous and susceptible to staining. During this vulnerable period, coffee can quickly undo the whitening effects and cause discoloration. Here's why:

‚Ä¢ Open tooth pores after whitening
‚Ä¢ High staining potential of coffee
‚Ä¢ Increased absorption of pigments
‚Ä¢ Potential for rapid re-staining

The Critical Waiting Period: How Long to Avoid Coffee

Most dental professionals recommend a strict **waiting period of at least 48 hours** after teeth whitening before consuming coffee. Some experts even suggest extending this to 72 hours for optimal results. During this time, your teeth are most vulnerable to staining and require special care.

Immediate Post-Whitening Beverage Guidelines

Safe beverages immediately after teeth whitening include:
1. Water
2. Clear herbal tea
3. Milk
4. White-colored drinks

Beverages to Avoid:
1. Coffee
2. Red wine
3. Dark teas
4. Colored sodas
5. Dark juices

Long-Term Coffee Consumption After Teeth Whitening

Once the initial waiting period passes, you can gradually reintroduce coffee. However, consider these strategies to minimize staining:

‚Ä¢ Use a straw to minimize direct contact with teeth
‚Ä¢ Rinse mouth with water immediately after drinking
‚Ä¢ Brush teeth within 30 minutes of coffee consumption
‚Ä¢ Consider lighter roasts which stain less

Professional Recommendations for Coffee Drinkers

Dental experts suggest several practical approaches for coffee lovers:

**Moderation is Key**
‚Ä¢ Limit coffee intake
‚Ä¢ Practice good oral hygiene
‚Ä¢ Use whitening toothpaste
‚Ä¢ Schedule regular dental cleanings

Alternative Options for Coffee Enthusiasts

If you're worried about staining, consider these alternatives:
‚Ä¢ Cold brew coffee (less acidic)
‚Ä¢ Adding milk to reduce staining potential
‚Ä¢ Switching to lighter roasts
‚Ä¢ Using whitening touch-up treatments

Protecting Your Investment: Ongoing Teeth Whitening Care

Maintaining your bright smile requires consistent effort. Beyond avoiding coffee initially, focus on:
‚Ä¢ Regular brushing
‚Ä¢ Flossing
‚Ä¢ Professional cleanings
‚Ä¢ Touch-up whitening treatments

When to Consult a Dental Professional

If you have specific concerns about coffee consumption after teeth whitening, always consult your dentist. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific treatment and dental health.

Conclusion

Understanding how to care for your teeth after whitening is crucial for maintaining those stunning results. While coffee doesn't have to be permanently off-limits, strategic approaches and careful management can help you enjoy your favorite beverage without compromising your bright smile. By following professional guidelines and practicing good oral hygiene, you can keep your teeth looking brilliantly white while still enjoying your daily coffee ritual.",1,1736912722.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False
1i1osh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1i1osh8/decided_to_step_back_from_a_job_opportunity_after/,Decided to Step Back From a Job Opportunity After Interview and Glassdoor Review,"I had an interview for a Senior Customer Success Manager role recently, and let me tell you, the whole process left me with some serious red flags. After our conversation, I decided to share my story because it perfectly aligns with what I read in their Glassdoor review.

In the interview, I got the sense that they were searching for a ‚Äúperfect candidate‚Äù who could check every single box on their long list of expectations. The interviewer even mentioned that his previous interviews weren‚Äôt long enough, adding an additional step, and that they were looking for someone who met every criteria perfectly-basically a unicorn.

I mean, the whole thing felt like a game of ""how many hoops can we make this candidate jump through?"" I get that finding the right fit is important, but when the process starts feeling more about checking off an impossible list rather than understanding someone's potential, that's a huge red flag.

Here's one of their Glassdoor reviews: ""This company‚Äôs hiring process is a parade of disorganization masquerading as thoroughness. Four rounds of interviews, a presentation, and a CEO coffee chat‚Äîfor a $80K role. After weeks of effort, they rejected all finalists, claiming none ‚Äúchecked all the boxes.‚Äù Instead of making a decision, they‚Äôve opted to restart the process entirely, wasting everyone‚Äôs time. It‚Äôs painfully clear they have no idea what they‚Äôre looking for. Leadership seems paralyzed by their own indecision, chasing some mythical candidate instead of recognizing potential talent. This isn‚Äôt a company searching for the right fit, it‚Äôs a masterclass in navel-gazing and mismanagement. Rejecting everyone at the final stage is an insult to the candidates and reveals a fatal flaw in their leadership. Companies like this always fail, they waste time obsessing over perfection instead of making smart, pragmatic choices. If they can‚Äôt even hire for a mid-level role without this much chaos, how can they possibly build a successful business? Don‚Äôt waste your time on this bad bet.""

The company is more focused on perfection than practicality, which got me thinking about how much time I‚Äôd be wasting. Not just mine, but theirs as well. And I started to realize that this kind of rigid mindset could easily lead them to miss out on talented and qualified individuals who don‚Äôt fit their narrow mold.

So, I decided to take a step back. Here‚Äôs the message I sent after the interview:

Thank you for the chance to interview for the Senior Customer Success Manager role. After thoughtful consideration, I‚Äôve decided to step back from pursuing this opportunity.

Our conversation, combined with insights I‚Äôve gathered from a Glassdoor review, made it clear that the role requires a ‚Äúperfect candidate‚Äù to meet your expectations, along with additional interview steps to ensure no box is left unchecked. While I have no doubt that I could be the unicorn you‚Äôre looking for, I refuse to dedicate myself to a drawn-out interview process that seems to prioritize perfection over practicality.

I believe my time is better spent on opportunities where the focus is on collaboration, growth, and recognizing transferable skills-not an exhaustive checklist. In my experience, this approach risks wasting both the candidate's time and the organization‚Äôs, and ultimately, it could result in missing out on talented and qualified individuals who don‚Äôt fit the narrow mold.

Thank you for your time, and best of luck in your search.

I‚Äôm sharing this because I think it‚Äôs a good reminder: Don't settle for a process that treats you like a checklist. It‚Äôs not just about finding a perfect fit-it's about recognizing potential and creating a mutually beneficial relationship.

But they have now came back in some capacity and my life is going to shit knowing that I can't still have them.,"I was promoted to a Team Lead position in the mid of December '23. Before becoming a Team Lead, I did train a batch of employees on the job basics. There was a guy named Bill (Not sharing his real name) in the training. I trained that person as well and he held me in high regards. He was so impressed with the job that he also brought his two sisters, two cousins and his wife to the office as well. He put in a really good word for me in front of them and told them how I had trained him so they already had a good image of me.

Fast forward the new batch of employees with his sisters also passed. One of his sisters caught my eye a bit. She looked pretty. I kept it to myself. Even after becoming the team lead. Me, him and his whole family had lunch together. I tried to talk to his sister Anna, as much as I can. His other sister was Sarah who was a few years younger then Anna. Anna was the one that caught my eye. She initially texted me for general work related queries.

I started to text her a bit as well. I liked her vibe. I was a bit tensed for not being recognized by the manager. She was a good listener and lent me a good ear every now and then and then also gave me good pieces of advice every now and then. We started texting each other more casually. She shared some of her concerns with me as well. I felt good that she did. I also advised, recommended and supported her in her endeavours.

One day she said that she wanted us to act formally on the floor and casually on the chat only. I didn't like that. I got defensive and said, I don't usually talk so casually in the office with you either. We had a small fight in me becoming a bit cold. She said that we will resolve the matter the next day over a cup of tea. I said okay. But I was still cold and the next day, I gave her a cold shoulder. She couldn't really bear it and went outside the office to it's entrance door. I thought I had gone too far and went after her. When I reached the gate. There are steps there. She was sitting on the steps. I asked her what was the issue. She said, don't you know what is the issue?! I said I really don't. She started crying. I was taken aback. I was amazed at the fact that someone can cry for me as well. I told her that we can go upstairs for tea. But she didn't come upstairs. All the time, I kept wondering to myself that can I hold such a value for someone that they will start to cry if I don't talk to them. My shift ended, her shift would end 2 hours after mine. Now she was giving me a cold shoulder. I beared with it. I stood back half an hour, 1 hour, 1 and half hour. Then I said, can we talk? She came outside. I told her how I only stayed around to make sure she was okay and to apologize for making her cry. On that day, something changed for the both of us. A little spark was ignited.

We started to act more and more causally with each other in office. We went on breaks together. We had food together and tea breaks together as well. We became fond of each other. She liked the way that I treated all the ladies in the office with respect. I loved the way that she radiated everyone around her with her energy. We used to text each other 4-5 or some days 6 hours as well.

One day, while we were casually texting, I found out that she was committed to someone by her family. She told me how she really didn't want it but that is how it was. She was committed to marry a close relative by her parents and she had agreed to it as well. She had already also signed an agreement which officially meant that she was going to marry that person in near future.

I asked her how she felt about the guy and she told me that she didn't like him much. He was boring and didn't really make things exciting. She really despised going out with him anywhere and didn't really see a life ahead with him. I did understand the fact that she was committed to someone and I wanted to respect it as well.

She soon started sharing with me about how controlling that person was. How he would snap if she would not respond to him in a few minutes or if she missed his calls. She started to grow more and more fond of me. She made comments that you usually make when you are really interested in someone and called me a person who held a ""Special Place"" in her life. She also used to say stuff like how would she be able to forget me. She also used to say that she cried the night before knowing that nothing can be changed in her life and she couldn't be detached from the person she was going to end up with because of the family pressures. She used to literally cry every night as per her. One day she was very upset, she asked how she can spend a life with a person who doesn't even respect her. I asked her about the whole thing but she said that she will share her story when she comes to the office. We went for tea and she shared her story with me. I told her to sit down firmly with her husband to be and have a word about how she deserves respect and how him not giving it to her is affecting her mentally. She said that if she does have a word with him regarding it, he might hold a grudge with her after she goes to live with him. I told her to have a word still. I told her to have a word with him in a civil manner. All this while though, she was saying all the stuff to me like how she wanted to be with me 24/7 and how she wanted me to do everything with her, having food with her, having tea with her, sitting right next to her and me making lonnnnng conversations with her. I was also dumbfounded and praised her smile, her looks, her character and her demeanor. She apologized when I made a mistake and I apologized when she made a mistake. She would become angry with me if she would find out that I was late to work and I wasn't able to do much work because of her being around. It was beautiful and exhilarating. We would talk for hours and still felt like we had a lot more to say.

She would cry the nights and say if she left the guy, who would take her. She was 26 and her parents didn't have enough money for dowry and people generally demand dowry. She told me how her parents were in sho much debt. I couldn't say much because I wanted to respect the document that she signed which said that she would marry that person. I was afraid that she already has a lot on her plate at that time. I didn't want myself to add on top of her problems. I told her how it was going to be fine and how God will help her and all that. I did have that spark for her but I didn't want it to take over my judgement. And besides, I didn't have so much feelings for her at that time to begin with.

She, for the first time, added a WhatsApp story as to how God makes plans for people and the people have to wait to see the beauty in his plans and all that. Before adding the story she had cried a lot, by saying how nothing can happen.

She had a word with her in laws to be, not directly with her husband to be. They agreed to have a word with her husband to be and she felt a bit of a comfort. I felt a bit bad in my heart at that time though. Like I had lost the opportunity at something. But I kept it to myself and felt happy for her in front of her.

We kept being friends. She still shared her insights with me. She them one day shared how she had cried a lot again because of what her husband to be said to her. She went ahead and cried a lot in front of her sister. Then she also told me how he had disrespected her. I felt shitty to myself thinking that I could've ultimately have changed her mind back then when she was deciding to end it all with him. I felt myself to be responsible for some of the pain now that she was getting. I started to take more care of her. I started to bring her more things to eat. I started to bring her the things of her choice. Her happiness started to bring me joy. Seeing her happy made me happy.

She one day said to me that she didn't want me to get too attached to her. She told me that she had to leave one day as it was inevitable. I confessed to her about my feeling partially. We still had a back and forth. We always went everywhere together. She always sat right besides me. We would talk for hours in office. I started to love to eat whatever she did. I started to love to do whatever she did. I would go ahead and make coffee for her which we both had.

All this while, her husband to be kept having at her with his attitude issues and she kept telling me how she was bothered. One day, I confessed that I was madly in love with her. She told me how it was so difficult for her to change her decision because of the person that was selected for her was her family's choice. I proposed to her and told her that she could have me as her partner. I didn't have anything too special to offer but I could give her a life where she would be loved unconditionally. I told her how I would do 99% of the work if she was just willing to put 1% of effort. She said that she would think of something.

Then after three to four days, she told me, her parents weren't agreeing to it because they thought it was sinful to breach the contract. She just told me how nothing could be done. At this time I was so attached to her, that if she was sick, I would get uncomfortable and would want to ease her pain. I couldn't go a day without asking if she was doing okay. She told me to care less for her as she would leave and I would be terribly heartbroken but she herself couldn't move away from me.

In the ending days, after 8-9 months of this rollercoaster ride, I sorta accepted the fact that that she would leave. I just wanted to spend as much time with her as possible before she went away. We had half days together. When had breaks together. I asked her about her preparations. I told her how I cried a lot in the nights just thinking that we wouldn't end up together. She apologized constantly. She did say that she didn't think that the marriage would last long. She acted like being unphased in front of me but some employee reported to have seen her crying after leaving from a break with me.

The fateful day came. It was her wedding day. I went to it in order to grasp the reality that she was gonna leave so I should go to her wedding in order to see her for a last time. I couldn't stomach it all. But ultimately she got married...

It looked exactly like the pictures‚Äîquaint, tucked into the trees that picturesquely hid a roof that needed replacing. The kind of place someone more optimistic might describe as ‚Äúcharming.‚Äù I wanted it to feel charming. I wanted Claire to see it that way too.

‚ÄúHere we are,‚Äù I said, forcing a little enthusiasm into my voice as I pulled into the narrow driveway.

Claire didn‚Äôt respond. She was staring at her phone, thumb scrolling slowly, her face bathed in the faint blue glow.

‚ÄúLooks nice, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù I tried again, louder this time.

She glanced up, eyes flicking to the cabin, then back to her screen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù she murmured.

I killed the engine and sat for a moment, gripping the steering wheel. Fine. Of course it was fine. That‚Äôs how everything was with us these days. Just fine.

The wind picked up as I stepped out of the car, sharp and bitter against my face. The sky hung low and heavy, the snow swirling in lazy drifts that would soon grow into something heavier. 

I turned, taking in my surroundings. The cabin sat perched on the mountainside, the winding road we'd taken visible below, snaking through the trees like a thin, fragile thread. The road had split and veered back toward town a quarter mile before, leaving only a slick, cobbled driveway behind. For the first time in months, there was no sound of traffic-no hum of engines or distant voices. Just the wind, growing louder by the second, and the soft, eerie hush of falling snow. The kind of quiet that presses in on you, suffocating, until you're not sure whether it's the world holding its breath or you.

I looked back at Claire, still sitting in the passenger seat. She‚Äôd finally looked up from her phone and seemed to really be taking in the cabin. For a second I was hopeful that she was excited to be here, but I quickly realized her face was washed with a vague disdain for the building.

‚ÄúCan you grab your bags?‚Äù I asked, leaning back in the door.

She sighed‚Äîa little too loudly‚Äîand climbed out, shivering as she zipped her coat and put her phone in her pocket. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs freezing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs December in Colorado,‚Äù I said, trying for humor. ‚ÄúWhat did you expect?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt laugh.

The cabin door resisted when I pushed it open, the wood swollen and warped from years of wear and weather. Inside, the cabin smelled faintly of pine and something musty, the dull damp scent reminding me of our little apartment back home. The floors groaned underfoot as I stepped in, the sound muffled by faded rugs and soft wood. A stone fireplace dominated the far wall, and a small kitchen sat off to the left, its appliances outdated but at least appearing functional. To our right, a narrow hallway with two doors and a pull-down attic string seemed to be the way to our bathroom and bedroom. Generic framed paintings and kitschy souvenirs adorned the hall, gathering dust. Telltale signs of a home that had been long delegated to live out its days as a holiday rental.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cozy,‚Äù I said, setting our bags down by the door.

Claire brushed past me without a word, heading straight for the couch. She dropped onto it, pulling her phone out again and scrolling as if it were the only thing keeping her tethered to the world. At least she looked comfortable to finally be out of the car. 

I sighed, my breath puffing out in the chilly air as I set our bags down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the fire going.‚Äù

The fireplace was old, caked in soot, and looked like it probably hadn‚Äôt passed an inspection in decades, but there was a neat stack of logs and kindling waiting beside it. I knelt down, striking a few damp matches until one finally lit, and coaxed a flame to life. Warmth crept into the room as the fire caught, long shadows dancing across the wooden walls.

‚ÄúBetter?‚Äù I asked, glancing at Claire.

She looked up, and flashed me a curt smile and nod before burying herself again in her phone. I found myself soured at the realization that her signal here must somehow be decent enough to keep endlessly scrolling.

I busied myself unpacking, the silence between us growing heavier with each passing minute. The snow had started falling harder now, the wind rattling the windows. The cabin groaned softly, the sound deep and patient, like a long-held sigh. I paused, listening, but it was just the home shifting under the slowly increasing burden of the snow on the roof.

‚ÄúAt least this place has some character,‚Äù I said, trying to break the silence.

Claire didn‚Äôt respond.

I sat down next to her, rubbing my hands together as I tried to ignore the vague dampness of the couch. ‚ÄúLook, Claire, I know this trip isn‚Äôt exactly your idea of relaxing, but I thought‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired,‚Äù she cut in, standing abruptly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúClaire‚Ä¶‚Äù

She was already walking down the hall, her footsteps sharp against the creaky floorboards. A door shut, and I was left alone with the fire and the sound of the growing storm outside. 

I leaned back, staring at the dancing flames. I pulled a blanket out of one of my bags, and was relieved to find that the couch reclined. 

‚ÄúMaybe it would be best if you slept on the couch tonight.‚Äù

Claire‚Äôs words from days prior rattled through my head. It hadn‚Äôt just been that night- we hadn‚Äôt slept in the same room since. I had hoped that would change tonight, but I resigned myself to fall asleep by the crackling fire.

 The cabin let out another low groan, the sound making the hairs on the back of my neck prickle.
I looked out the window once more, and realized that the growing storm had become a blizzard. Cold air blew in through the crack under the front door, and I could tell my car wasn‚Äôt moving anytime soon. 

It was going to be a long night.

-

Morning crept in slowly, the storm outside reduced to a dull whisper of snow against the windows. The fire had died overnight, leaving the cabin bitterly cold. I dragged myself off the couch and pulled on a sweatshirt, shivering as I walked into the kitchen.

Claire was already up, sitting at the small table by the window, her coffee mug sitting in front of her on the table, untouched. She wasn‚Äôt looking at her phone, which felt like progress, but her eyes were fixed on the snow-covered trees outside. Her head was tilted towards the hallway, as though she were listening for me coming.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù I said, grabbing the remaining chipped mug from the counter.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù she replied quietly, not turning to look at me.

I poured myself some coffee, the pot nearly cold since she‚Äôd made it. She must‚Äôve been up for hours. 

‚ÄúThe storm looks like it‚Äôs easing up,‚Äù I said, leaning against the counter. ‚ÄúMaybe we could take a walk later? Get some fresh air.‚Äù

She made a vague noise of hesitant agreement, but her body language was closed off‚Äîlegs tucked under her, shoulders hunched. It wasn‚Äôt outright hostility, but it wasn‚Äôt exactly welcoming either.

I watched her for a moment, my coffee growing colder in my hands. I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from thinking about the things she‚Äôd said to me during our last fight, words that had settled into me like splinters. 

‚ÄúIf you want to book that stupid anniversary trip, go right ahead. You just bulldoze ahead like what you want is the only thing that matters.‚Äù

I took a deep breath and turned away, sipping my coffee.

That‚Äôs when I heard it‚Äîa faint sound, just on the edge of my perception.

I froze, tilting my head toward the hallway. It was so faint that I couldn‚Äôt be sure I wasn‚Äôt imagining it, like the hum of an appliance or a distant murmur muffled through walls.

‚ÄúYou hear that?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù Claire‚Äôs voice sounded annoyed, but she glanced over her shoulder towards the hallway as well.

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, a noise. It sounds like‚Ä¶ talking? Singing, maybe?‚Äù

She frowned. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably the wind.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I muttered. 

We finished up our coffee, and put our mugs in the sink. We‚Äôd long fallen out of our habit of washing dishes together, and there wasn‚Äôt a dishwasher in sight. 

As I began to slip on my boots, Claire slowly shambled to the bedroom, with no indication that she‚Äôd be getting dressed for our walk. 

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to join me, honey? The storm‚Äôs clearing up, it‚Äôll be nice to get out of here for a bit.‚Äù

There was a moment of silence and I thought she would ignore me once more, but after a moment, her voice mumbled through the cracked bedroom door.

‚ÄúThis trip will be a lot easier for the both of us if we don‚Äôt have to pretend. Go on your walk, I‚Äôll be here on my phone.‚Äù

My anger finally burst forth, having been restrained in an attempt to salvage this trip.

‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm the one making this harder than it has to be? You‚Äôre impossible to talk to, Claire.‚Äù I shouted towards the door. 

I heard her stand, feet shuffling towards the bedroom door, and it slammed shut. The house groaned in response, then settled, and once more the silence was swallowed up by the faint murmuring noise coming from the hallway.

-

The noise didn‚Äôt go away. As the day went on, it remained at the edge of my awareness, faint but persistent. I tried to ignore it, chalking it up to maybe wind blowing through a hole in the roof, or perhaps even a small animal seeking shelter from the cold. It made me uneasy. There was a familiarity to the noise that I couldn‚Äôt place.

We ate dinner in near silence, the tension between us heavy enough to fill the small kitchen. Claire pushed her canned pasta around her plate, barely eating.

‚ÄúIs it bothering you?‚Äù I asked finally.

She looked up, startled that I‚Äôd broken the quiet.

‚ÄúIs what bothering me?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe noise. I thought maybe‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear anything,‚Äù she said quickly, cutting me off.

I opened my mouth to argue, but stopped myself. I‚Äôd learned by now not to tell her when I thought she was wrong about something. Instead, I finished my meal in silence, the faint static prickling at the edge of my hearing.

It wasn‚Äôt until we were piling our dishes in the sink when the cold wind stopped entirely for the first time since our arrival, and the sound was louder than it had ever been. 

Claire turned her head towards the hallway, and I grinned.

‚ÄúSo you do hear it!‚Äù I‚Äôll admit I was a little smug when she rolled her eyes at me. 

‚ÄúFine I hear it. But it‚Äôs nothing, just this stupid old cabin falling apart.‚Äù

Claire turned to walk towards the hallway, and I began to walk towards my makeshift bed on the couch when she turned towards me, sighed, and gestured for me to join her in the bedroom.

I happily took my blanket from the couch, and finally went to bed with a little warmth.

-

As I fell asleep, I dreamt of our wedding day. It‚Äôs ironic, on a trip that was intended to celebrate our fifth anniversary, it was the first time my wedding had even crossed my mind.

I dreamt I was at the altar, holding hands with my wife. Her palms felt cold and clammy in my own, and she looked upset. I looked at her, trying to imagine a future in which we could be happy, but her scowl burnt holes through my hope. 

As the minister began to conclude the ceremony and asked if anyone in the crowd held objections, a voice rang from the audience. I turned towards the crowd, and was shocked to see Claire- or yet, another Claire. She was dressed comfortably, in the sweater she‚Äôd worn on our first date. She looked radiant, smiling like how she used to, and was eagerly trying to get my attention. 

‚ÄúJason! Jason I love you! Come here, come to me please! Don‚Äôt do this!‚Äù She cried, as though it were of utmost urgency. 

I turned back to my bride to be, and was taken aback to find her withering before me. Her skin sallowed and stretched tight over her bones, her rosy cheeks deflating and her eyes growing darker. I couldn‚Äôt look away as she guided my hand to her side, wet with blood. 

I awoke in a cold sweat to the noise from above. 

It was louder now, unmistakable. Not static exactly, but something uneven and distorted, like voices filtering through a bad connection. 

I sat up in bed, heart thudding in my chest. Claire stirred beside me, groaning softly.

‚ÄúJason?‚Äù she mumbled.

‚ÄúDo you hear that?‚Äù I asked, my voice low.

She didn‚Äôt answer right away, but her face tensed as she strained to listen. The sound wasn‚Äôt just faint anymore‚Äîit was distinct, tangible. I could finally make out the noise- it was voices. Rushed, muted speech, garbled by a grumbling static, the words muddy and indiscernible.

‚ÄúIs that a radio?‚Äù she asked, sitting up.

‚ÄúI think so,‚Äù I said, already climbing out of bed.

We followed the sound into the hallway, our footsteps loud on the creaky floor. The noise grew stronger as we neared the end of the hall, where a pull-down attic door sat flush with the ceiling.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Claire muttered, staring at it.

I reached up, tugging the ladder rope down with a loud groan of wood and metal- it didn‚Äôt budge. Claire fished her phone out of her pajama pocket, and shone her flashlight up towards the attic door. There was a small four-digit padlock holding the door shut. The owners clearly didn‚Äôt want any guests entering the attic.

The noise was much clearer now, a steady static interspersed with faint bursts of garbled speech.

‚ÄúYou think the owners left a radio on up there?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù she said, though her tone was uncertain. ‚ÄúWe should call them.‚Äù

I nodded, pulling out my phone. The number that was left on the AirBnB listing went straight to voicemail. I left a message, trying to sound calm but insistent. 

‚ÄúGuess we‚Äôll just have to deal with it for now,‚Äù I said, uneasy at the thought of leaving it playing all through the night. 

Claire‚Äôs expression hardened. ‚ÄúDeal with it? How are we supposed to sleep with that going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, okay?‚Äù I snapped, my annoyance bubbling over and giving way to anger. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do, break in?‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not starting anything,‚Äù I shot back.

She stormed off without another word, the bedroom door slamming behind her.

I stood alone in the hallway, staring up at the attic door. The static buzzed in my ears, louder now, almost rhythmic.

It felt like it was waiting for something.

-

The next morning, I found Claire in the kitchen again, standing by the counter with her arms crossed and a mug of untouched coffee sitting beside her. She wasn‚Äôt scrolling through her phone this time‚Äîjust staring out the window as the storm‚Äôs remnants swirled in slow, aimless patterns.

The radio hadn‚Äôt stopped. It had finally grown quieter in the early hours of the morning, but now it was back, faint but persistent, distorted speech pouring through the ceiling, filling the air with tension.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt sleep, did you?‚Äù I asked, trying to keep my voice neutral.

She turned her head slightly, just enough to glance at me from the corner of her eye. ‚ÄúHard to sleep when there‚Äôs a radio running all night.‚Äù

I sighed and leaned against the doorway. ‚ÄúI already tried calling the owner again when I woke up. What do you want me to do? Smash the lock and risk paying for damages?‚Äù

Her shoulders tensed, and I could feel the argument building before she even opened her mouth. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the noise, Jason,‚Äù she said, turning to face me fully now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the voices.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre faint,‚Äù I replied, brushing her concern aside. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just some talk show or something‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that,‚Äù she snapped, her voice rising. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs creepy. It‚Äôs weird. And you‚Äôre acting like it‚Äôs normal!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs normal,‚Äù I said, my patience wearing thin. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not going to lose my mind over a busted radio in an old house, either.‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed, and she stepped closer, her voice low and sharp. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always like this. You act like I‚Äôm crazy for being upset, like everything‚Äôs my fault because I can‚Äôt just ‚Äòrelax‚Äô like you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair, Claire,‚Äù I said, my jaw tightening. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting like I put the damn radio there just to piss you off.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe you didn‚Äôt, but you sure as hell aren‚Äôt doing anything about it.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to fire back when something stopped me.

A voice crackled through the static, clearer and louder than anything we‚Äôd heard so far.

‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm the one making this harder than it has to be? You‚Äôre impossible to talk to, Claire.‚Äù

I froze.

Claire‚Äôs eyes widened as she stared at me, her face pale. ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù

I hesitated, trying to process what I‚Äôd just heard. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs nothing. Probably just‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù she said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me that wasn‚Äôt you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me,‚Äù I insisted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúJason, that was exactly what you said to me yesterday‚Äù

The static broke again, like a scratched record, and the voice resumed, now faint but unmistakable: ‚ÄúStop putting this all on me, Claire. You‚Äôre just imagining things, I didn‚Äôt go anywhere tonight.‚Äù

I took a step back, my stomach twisting. It wasn‚Äôt just the words‚Äîit was the cadence, the exact rhythm of my voice.

Claire‚Äôs hands trembled as she pressed them to her forehead. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you, you‚Äôre doing this,‚Äù she said, her voice sharp and brittle. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to mess with me, with my emotions. Do you think it‚Äôs funny‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No!‚Äù I said, my own voice rising now. ‚ÄúClaire, how could I even‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been trying to fix this trip from the beginning, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù she spat. She began to hyperventilate. ‚ÄúLike we could just patch everything up if- if somehow you controlled the situation!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not controlling anything!‚Äù

The static surged, loud enough to make my ears ring, and through it came another burst of words, this time in Claire‚Äôs voice: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so damn selfish, Jason. You only care about fixing things on your terms.‚Äù

Her face crumpled as the words registered, and she looked at me like she‚Äôd been slapped.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs from‚Ä¶ last summer,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúWhen we fought about my job offer. That‚Äôs me.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to deny it, to tell her she was wrong, but then I heard it again‚Äîher voice, warped but unmistakable, repeating the exact words I‚Äôd heard her yell during that fight.

‚ÄúYou want to fix everything, Jason? Why don‚Äôt you fix yourself first.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt just random.

It was us.

I backed up against the counter, my pulse pounding in my ears. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?‚Äù

Claire shook her head, her face pale and her hands still trembling. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to hear it anymore.‚Äù

She turned and stormed out of the kitchen, slamming the bedroom door behind her.

I stood there, staring at the ceiling where the faint sound of static hummed steadily through the boards. A chill ran down my spine as the sound shifted, and for a moment, I thought I could hear the creak of footsteps from above.

It was faint, almost imperceptible, but it was enough to keep me rooted in place, staring up at the locked attic door, as Claire‚Äôs garbled voice echoed through the attic again.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I ever married you.‚Äù

-

Time blurred into itself, the storm outside returning to bury the cabin in deeper drifts of snow and the sound upstairs filling our world with a ceaseless, mocking static. At times, it would go quiet, just long enough for Claire and me to let our guards down, consider talking about something‚Äîanything‚Äîbeyond our own misery. But right when I thought we might have a chance at conversation, the radio would crackle back to life, louder and more intrusive than before.

It was a few days in when I realized that it wasn‚Äôt just replaying our worst arguments anymore- it was anything we‚Äôd spoken to or about each other. I heard my own voice from months ago telling a friend how ‚ÄúClaire doesn‚Äôt see me,‚Äù how ‚Äúshe makes everything a battle.‚Äù 

A while later it shifted to Claire‚Äôs voice, raw and sobbing, confiding in her sister that she didn‚Äôt know how much longer she could endure me. I recognized every word, every breath, because I remembered her phone call that night‚Äîshe‚Äôd locked herself in the bathroom, and I‚Äôd pressed my ear against the door. I had never regretting being nosy as much as that night. Here it was, echoing through the attic, laid bare.

Every time the voice became clearer, I‚Äôd see Claire‚Äôs face tighten, a tortured mix of guilt and fury. We couldn‚Äôt escape each other‚Äôs taunts, or the house‚Äôs apparent need to throw them at us like daggers.

We hardly said a word to each other, circling each other in the small cabin, surviving on canned soup and stale crackers. I tried calling the owner again and again, leaving voicemails that grew more frantic with each attempt. My calls went unreturned, my hope dwindling with each missed connection.  

Claire‚Äôs phone signal was the next to go. She‚Äôd tried to scroll through social media, text her friends, anything to distract herself, but no matter where she stood or where she tried, her phone could barely muster one bar. She sank onto the couch, eyes full of tears that she refused to let fall in front of me.

‚ÄúWe have to leave,‚Äù she whispered on our fifth day in the cabin, her voice trembling as she stared at the swirling white chaos through the window. ‚ÄúJason, I can‚Äôt stay here anymore.‚Äù

We had discussed leaving the day before, but the weather had barely permitted us to open the front door. It hadn‚Äôt let up much since then, but the desperation in her voice shook me. Without another word, we bundled up‚Äîthick coats, gloves, scarves. I helped tie her boots. There was something almost tender in the gesture, and for a moment I wondered if we could reconcile, to pull ourselves out of this nightmare by sheer force of will.

But stepping outside was like entering a frozen void. The wind whipped icy needles of snow at our faces, and the driveway was half-buried in drifts. I dug at the car door, yanking the icy handle open only to find the interior of the car felt as cold and lifeless as the air around us. The engine refused to turn over, coughing twice before going silent.

I glanced at Claire. Her eyes darted to the steep, unpaved road that snaked down the mountain. Even if the car started, we‚Äôd be risking our lives trying to maneuver those icy curves. We looked at each other, and I knew she felt as defeated as I did. 

We trudged back to the cabin, fighting each step through the wind. My fingers had gone numb in spite of my gloves. Claire was shivering violently, a silent terror in her eyes. When I finally managed to force the swollen cabin door open, that now-familiar static rushed out to greet us. 

And then I heard it. Claire‚Äôs voice upstairs, as usual, speaking words I wished I‚Äôd never have to hear. She sounded almost gentle, but her words were damning.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave him soon,‚Äù she said, her tone calm and intimate. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have a clue.‚Äù

My heart lurched.  Real or not, it felt like a blade twisting in my gut. I glanced at her. Her eyes were wide, tears threatening to spill, the betrayal fresh even though those words were her own. She looked at me, shook her head, and without speaking, retreated to the bedroom, shutting the door quietly behind her.

I stood there, snow melting on my boots, face stinging from the cold, and listened to the static pick up again. The cabin creaked in the wind, sounding almost like a soft, mocking laugh. I could only stare at the dying embers in the fireplace, wondering if anything in our lives would survive this place.

-

As the relentless static from the attic wore on, it seemed to scrape away at the edges of my sanity. The voices unearthed every bitter line, every whispered complaint we thought safely hidden. The cabin felt like a cage, trapping us with an auditory barrage that knew no bounds. Each new revelation, whether a conversation once held secret or a venomous whisper shared in confidence, added weight to an already unbearable tension.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just too much, Jason. Always fixing, never listening.‚Äù

Exhausted and desperate, I found myself fixated on the attic. The padlock‚Äîan old, rusted relic‚Äîmocked me from the ceiling hatch, a barrier to whatever twisted machine perpetuated our torment. I needed to get it open, needed to find out what was happening, but every traditional method had failed. No amount of pleading with the unresponsive owner or searching for a misplaced key had yielded any results. It was just Claire and me, growing more estranged with each passing hour.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to stay this distant forever, Claire, you might as well just leave.‚Äù

Determined, I approached the hatch again, armed with nothing but a sense of determination. I grabbed a chair from the kitchen, positioning it under the attic‚Äôs pull-down string. The padlock dangled just out of reach, an enigmatic sentinel guarding our tormentor. Did I even want to find out what was up there? The need to stop the voices overpowered any hesitation.

I fetched a small toolbox from under the kitchen sink‚Äîthe one that barely saw use‚Äîand rummaged through it for anything that might help. I came up with a couple of old screwdrivers and a tarnished set of Allen keys. Not ideal, but it was all I had.

‚ÄúWhy bother, Jason? It‚Äôs over, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

I ignored the jibes, focusing on the padlock. I tried each tool systematically, twisting and prodding in a futile attempt to force the mechanism. I eventually gave up on trying to break open the lock, and in my desperation, resorted to trying any and every combination I could think of. My hands, raw from the metal and the cold that seeped into the cabin, worked mechanically. Time lost meaning as I moved from one combination to the next, fueled by a mix of fury and a desperate need for silence.

Hours must have passed, the light outside dimming to the early twilight that predicted another long night. The numbers blurred before my eyes, each click a mockery as our voices cried from above.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to leave, you know. Can‚Äôt you tell?‚Äù  My brother‚Äôs voice seemed to boom down at me from above. I winced as I anticipated my next words.
‚ÄúLet her. I don‚Äôt need this hassle any longer.‚Äù

The frustration and shame built within me like a physical force, a crescendo that demanded release. As I furiously put in every four digit combination I could think of, the realization hit me like a brick. I stopped on a new combination; 1-2-3-1. Today‚Äôs date, but more importantly, our wedding anniversary. A detail that had slipped from my conscious mind but lay buried, a remnant of happier times.

With all of the remaining effort my frigid, tired hand could muster, I pulled. The lock clicked open.

Relief washed over me, quickly chased by apprehension. What would I find up there? Claire had arisen from the couch and watched, her face a mask of mingled fear and curiosity. Her silence was a gulf between us, but this act‚Äîopening the attic‚Äîfelt like the first truly shared moment in days.

I pulled the string, and the ladder creaked down, dust dancing in the air disturbed by its descent. We both flinched at the sharp, echoing sound of the radio, clear as day, coming from above. 

I hesitated, my hand on the ladder. The air felt charged, thick with the anticipation of what was yet to come. The static above us quieted for a moment, as if the attic itself held its breath.

‚ÄúWhat are you afraid of, Jason? You‚Äôre a coward! Just run away from it all, isn‚Äôt that what you always do?‚Äù

With a deep breath, I started to climb. The ladder groaned under my weight, each step a creak of old wood. Claire stayed below, her face upturned, watching me ascend into the darkness above.

As I approached the top, the chill of the attic wrapped around me, a cold whisper against my skin. I paused, flashlight in hand, ready to sweep away the shadows and uncover the source of our torment. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to turn it on, to see what was up here. At least not alone. Instead, I turned it down towards my wife, and extended my hand down to help her up.

As Claire and I reached the final step of the attic ladder, a chilling silence enveloped us, broken only by the echo of our hesitant footsteps on the floor. It didn‚Äôt feel like the rest of the cabin- it felt cheap, and warm. Linoleum?

The beam from my flashlight cut through the darkness, revealing a sight that made my heart skip a beat. The sight before us wasn‚Äôt just impossible, it was chilling. We were back home, in our crappy little apartment. Or, at least, a perfect replica of it. 

Every detail was meticulously reproduced: the arrangement of books on the shelves, the crease on the sofa cushion, even the small, almost imperceptible stain on the carpet near the TV stand. It was our home, duplicated with an unsettling precision, as if someone had taken a snapshot of our lives and recreated it here in the dusty confines of the attic. 

The air was unnervingly still, thick with a tension that seemed almost palpable. It felt as if the room was holding its breath, waiting for us to shatter the quiet. The musty smell that I‚Äôd noticed when first entering the cabin was amplified to the extreme, and was permeated with an iron, metallic scent that sent my stomach churning. 

My eyes swept the room, searching for the source of the voices that had tormented us. We didn‚Äôt own any radio, nor a record player or any speakers for that matter. Instead, my gaze landed on something far more familiar‚Äîmy laptop, open on the coffee table, its screen aglow.

I ran over to the battered device, tripping over its power cord as I went. The laptop sat neatly on the table, as the mouse plugged into it moved of its own accord, clicking the screen every few seconds. My eyes darted to the smudged screen, and discovered that it was opened to our security app. I‚Äôd installed cheap cameras around the apartment soon after we moved in. I‚Äôd told Claire that they were for our own safety, but in truth, they were for me- to revisit our arguments, to replay every fight we had, searching for vindication in the details.

The computer was clicking from clip to clip, playing a highlight reel of every terrible thing we‚Äôd ever said to or about each other. 

Claire joined me, her steps slow, almost reluctant. Her eyes widened in horror as she watched the screen. I looked back down at the laptop, only to realize that it had changed once again. I immediately recognized the fight- it was the most recent one before we‚Äôd left home.

‚ÄúClaire, would you listen to me? It‚Äôs two weeks, you‚Äôll live. It‚Äôll be nice and quiet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho says I even want nice and quiet? I want to get back to real life, Jason. I haven‚Äôt worked in months, and you planning these ‚Äòsurprise trips‚Äô to try to patch things isn‚Äôt helping me find a job‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what? I cancel the booking? I already paid the deposit Claire, we can‚Äôt get that money back. Or did you forget I‚Äôm also working a dead-end job?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you want to book that stupid anniversary trip, go right ahead. You just bulldoze ahead like what you want is the only thing that matters.‚Äù

I watched myself furrow my brow and then put my head in my hand.

‚ÄúClaire, I‚Äôm trying here. I really am. But I can never get through to you, can I? First it was you passing on the job offer when we needed that money, then it was that thing with your ex-‚Äú

‚ÄúI TOLD you, nothing happened Jason. He just‚Ä¶ he just stopped by for coffee, is all.‚Äù

‚ÄúClaire, I‚Äôm not stupid! You turned off the cameras but the audio was still recording, you idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare call me an idiot, after all I‚Äôve done for you.‚Äù

I watched as Claire had stormed towards me, and our fight was about to escalate. She pounced at me, but I threw her off of me towards the kitchen. I watched her crack her head on the edge of the table and fall through it.

I walked up to the table slowly. I observed her breathing grow shallow, as she lay spasming on the floor. I watched her breathing stop as blood slowly pooled around her. I watched myself stand up calmly, then walk into our bedroom. A minute later, I left, quietly wheeling our luggage towards the front door and leaving as my wife lay motionless.

Then, as if sensing its audience had seen enough, the laptop‚Äôs battery icon flashed once‚Äîcritical‚Äîand the screen went black. The sudden death of the device plunged me back into silence and darkness, a quiet so deep it was almost suffocating. The absence of the voices, which had been such a constant and invasive presence, now left a shallow emptiness that was somehow worse than the noise.

I sat for a moment, unable to process what I‚Äôd just seen. I turned my flashlight up towards Claire, only to see that I was now alone in the room, the dull smell of iron growing ever stronger from the kitchen. 

I shakily turned my flashlight again, this time towards the kitchen table, shrouded in a cloak of darkness that I hadn‚Äôt dared breach since I ascended the attic ladder.

There, lying crumpled in a heap of splintered wood, lay my wife. Dried blood had pooled around her head, and I winced at noticing that her neck was bent at an unnatural angle. She had begun to bloat and stiffen, and the closer I stepped, the more the iron scent of blood was replaced with a musky, rotted smell. 

She was almost entirely a corpse, save for her eyes. Fresh and watery, they were locked onto me, silently accusing me.

‚Äú‚Ä¶.Claire?‚Äù I whispered, praying with every fiber that somehow, she was still in there. 

But she didn‚Äôt respond, didn‚Äôt move. She lay frozen, staring intently, eyes following me as I nervously swayed. The air around us grew colder, denser, as if the room itself was closing in, feeding off the rising panic.

Then, almost imperceptibly, Claire began to whisper. The words were soft, disjointed murmurs at first, guttural sounds forcing their way out of a broken, bloated throat. As I drew closer, the whispers grew clearer, sharper. They were not the comforting words I yearned for but a continuation of the cascade of cruel, cutting phrases I‚Äôd grown accustomed to.

‚ÄúYou never really cared, did you, Jason? It was always about you, your needs.‚Äù Her voice was a ghost, devoid even of its usual disdain, hollow and haunting.

I stood, frozen, as her whispers intensified, layering upon each other in a relentless, cold assault. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so selfish. You think you‚Äôre the victim, always playing the martyr.‚Äù 

Each word sliced through the already frigid air. The whispers swelled into a torrent of accusations.

‚ÄúYou suffocate me, Jason. I can‚Äôt breathe with you, can‚Äôt grow. You‚Äôre a dead weight, dragging me down into your misery.‚Äù

I stumbled backward, hands clamped over my ears, but it was futile.

‚ÄúS- stop it Claire. Please get up, this isn‚Äôt okay. Please get up!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should have known I was too good for you. I wasted the best years of my life on a fantasy that you‚Äôd change.‚Äù

Her face, so familiar and yet so warped, contorted as her dead lips struggled to keep up with the verbal onslaught. The storm outside seemed to echo her fury, the wind howling against the walls as if in sympathy with her rage.

Overwhelmed and unable to bear it, I dropped to my knees, the cold of the floor seeping into my bones. Claire‚Äôs figure, crumpled across from mine, began to crunch as her frame contorted itself so she could continue to lock eyes with me. Her expression was blank, but her eyes piecing as she continued her litany of grievances. 

I crawled, sobbing, searching in the dark for the attic door that led me here, but it had long vanished. The floor was solid.

As the roar of the frozen world outside began to muffle, snow piling against our artificial windows, her voice was the only sound, a relentless echo in the ghostly replica of our apartment. Her words didn‚Äôt stop for hours, and by the time she began to quiet, she had managed to stand up and loom over me, cold and pale, whispering accusations and curses at me in the dark.

It has been weeks since the door to the outside vanished, leaving me trapped in my own home with the whispering thing that was once my wife. Claire, or the thing that used to be her, grows more gaunt by the day, her features sharpening, her eyes sinking deeper into her skull. She‚Äôs starting to smell, but she keeps whispering. She isn‚Äôt going to harm me‚Äînot physically. She can‚Äôt. Her body, crumbling and decaying, only has the energy to torment me with its gaze and with its words.

I‚Äôve tried the front door, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any more than decoration in this mockery of my home. It doesn‚Äôt lead outside, it doesn‚Äôt even open. It‚Äôs just part of the wall. The storm outside has not abated; I can hear it sometimes, through the thick snow that covers my windows. If the snow ever subsides, the windows may be my only chance at escape.

I‚Äôm typing this now as both a record and a plea. If you‚Äôre reading this, if this somehow finds its way to someone, anyone, do you know when the blizzard near Denver will let up? Is there any forecast about when the snow will start to melt? It‚Äôs cold in here, and I don‚Äôt think I can listen to her for much longer. ",4,1736912182.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1i1omqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1i1omqc/vyvanse_makes_me_feel_so_jittery_is_it_the_dose/,"Vyvanse makes me feel so jittery, is it the dose or the drug?","So for context, diagnosed about 5months ago, started on Vyvanse 30mg. Worked great for about 2 days and then I felt like it wasn‚Äôt working (plus a weird side effect was insane hunger which was meant to be the opposite of what it does - and not ideal at all when you‚Äôre overweight and trying to lose weight!). 

Psychiatrist bumped me up to 50mg after a month. Immediately noticed a huge difference, but along with the good side effects, the bad ones were also heightened. Even after several weeks on 50mg, nothing had calmed down, it hasn‚Äôt changed. 

Pro‚Äôs - food noise gone, can really concentrate at work (almost to a flaw, I find myself not taking breaks and overworking because I become obsessed), more motivated, initial 2hrs of taking the drug I become a very nice person lol

Cons - feels like my heart is racing, jitteriness (especially in hands but I can feel my muscles tensing all over), anxiety, a level of brain fog I can‚Äôt explain because I can concentrate, but I feel‚Ä¶like my head is full?

Whilst I appreciate being able to be productive and motivated by work (especially since I‚Äôm in a high stress job and need that), I‚Äôm starting to dread taking the meds during the week when I need them because I can‚Äôt stand these side effects. I don‚Äôt want to feel highly anxious every day, that‚Äôs not right. And this lasts 6-8hrs so I have to live with that feeling all day. 

As someone who already has imposter syndrome and wonders if I really have ADHD or not, these side effects are not helping lol. 
I‚Äôm not sure if maybe going down to 40mg will help, or whether Vyvanse just isn‚Äôt for me. I was also prescribed Dexamfetamine 5mg to try, but they give me the same side effects (just lesser, and for less time). 

Has anyone experienced these side effects with Vyvanse and found another type of drug that‚Äôs better? 
Has anyone had experience with non-stimulants? I‚Äôd be open to trying them, but because I struggle with motivation I wonder if they would lack in that department.  

Edit: 
Forgot to say I always make sure I take my meds after a high protein breakfast, and I don‚Äôt consume caffeine during the day afterwards. I do wake up and have a small coffee, I probably take my meds about 2hrs after this coffee. I try to make sure I eat a lunch too, even if it‚Äôs small. I know not having protein/not eating can make side effects worse but I‚Äôve been pretty good with making sure I have good food in my stomach beforehand. ",3,1736912179.0,adhdwomen,4,1.0,False

1i1om3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/vipassana/comments/1i1om3t/practical_notes_10_day_course_at_kaufman/,Practical notes 10 Day Course at Kaufman,"I just finished a 10 day course at Dhamma Siri in Kaufman, Texas and wanted to share some practical information I would have liked to know as a new student.

FYI - I am female and went to Kaufman in January. So I only know about the female residence, dining hall and the weather conditions for this time of year.

Firstly, Dhamma Siri is such a nice facility (from what I‚Äôve been told relative to some other vipassana centers). There will only be 4 things you will be doing while you are there - meditating for 11ish hours daily, going to the dining hall, walking on the marked paths, and sleeping.

**Living quarters** \- The female residence only has single occupancy rooms with your own bathroom. The walls are thin and you will hear every sound in the next room, but at least you aren‚Äôt trying to avoid eye contact while sharing a room. Beds were comfortable, with one pillow and blanket. I found the room I got to be quite clean (thank you to the student there before me).

**Food** \- Basic, vegetarian. I think menu really depends on capabilities of the servers from course to course. The staples that are always there for breakfast and lunch are toast, peanut butter, jelly, butter, tahini, yogurt, salad bar, rice cakes, variety of teas, instant coffee, milk, soy milk and almond milk. There are also basic spices, psyllium husk supplement, flax seeds, lemon juice, ACV, and olive oil. There is often some sort of bean dish as the main protein - I say that as a warning to people who cannot digest beans well and then plan on going into a silent meditation hall. Don‚Äôt do it, even if it‚Äôs the only protein available. I may or may not have learned this the hard way.

**Meditation** \- Yes, you will be expected to meditate for 10ish hours a day. There are a lot of cushions of every kind at the center you can use, and because I flew there, I had to rely on what the center had. Every day was like legos trying to figure out what would be comfortable for such long meditation periods. If you haven‚Äôt meditated for longer than 20 mins prior to this, I would suggest experimenting with sitting on the floor with whatever mediation chair or cushions you have for an hour, and bring what works for you if you are arriving via car. One student had this really luxe meditation chair and we were all so impressed by her ability to sit still for all 10 days - google the Alexia meditation chair. You also will likely be using at least two blankets / shawls during meditation for comfort. One over your shoulders and one over your legs unless you bring a large enough blanket to just cover it all. The center has a lot of blankets if you need to borrow them.

**Packing** \- The idea (for some) is that you shouldn't need anything and that the course is all about immersing into the environment that was created - but from my POV, the more comfortable you can be (within reason) the better. Why add to the misery if you can help it a little?

This is not a ""need"" list - the packing list provided once you are accepted is the minimum of what you should bring. The center provided alarm clocks in every room (from what I saw of female dorms) and had extra misc. donated linens, blankets, towels, hair dryers, etc. if you forget something.

  
Notes in addition to the obvious packing list:

* Casio silent vibration alarm watch was so useful the whole time - look for it on amazon
* I brought a 1L water bottle and a thermos cup for tea. I also saw people with large thermos for tea or hot water for their rooms too
* Shower shoes. The shower was clean, but I am not risking foot fungus.
* I desperately wished I had a humidifier. It‚Äôs cold and the central heat was blowing hard. My poor skin, eyes and nostrils were like the Sahara desert.
* Tip: After a few days, I implemented the rule that I would only wear one pair of sweats for the dining hall. It's a cafeteria and working kitchen, and your clothing smells like it. I have a sensitive sense of smell so it would drive me crazy if I was meditating for 11 hours and smelling like food.
* Prioritize bringing enough and GOOD socks. You are mostly walking in socks on all carpeted areas (dorms and dhamma hall). You will want warm, quality socks.
* Bring immunity support supplements, basic pharmacy items for cold or allergies. People are coughing all around, you will want your Cold Calm or whatever. Also see above in food section for a strong suggestion of Beano.
* Earplugs. More people snore than you would think. The walls are very thin.

That post received a lot of engagement, and today I want to dive deeper into the working environments here. This isn‚Äôt just about my personal experience; it reflects what I‚Äôve heard from nearly everyone I‚Äôve met in similar situations.

The reality is that many employers here take advantage of the circumstances that workers face. They know that you‚Äôre in a tough spot, especially if you‚Äôre on a visit visa that‚Äôs about to expire or have family responsibilities. For many companies, it‚Äôs a race to the bottom, exploiting workers to stay competitive. Sadly, the blame doesn‚Äôt just rest on these employers‚Äîit‚Äôs a system-wide issue.

Before I go further, I want to make something very clear: please don‚Äôt judge my experiences based on stereotypes or assumptions about my willingness to accept mistreatment. I am Syrian, and I came here with strong skills, high hopes, and a clear sense of self-respect. I am not someone who‚Äôs ready to be treated unfairly or ‚Äújust take it‚Äù for the sake of survival. My story is about how the system grinds people down, even those who are determined to succeed.

After enduring months in a toxic workplace, I eventually made the decision to leave the job. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but I realized that staying any longer would have destroyed my mental health completely.

I don‚Äôt want to make this post overly long, so I‚Äôll outline my daily routine and some of the workplace conditions I experienced:

# My Daily Routine as a Software Developer

* **Work Schedule**: 6 days a week, 9 hours a day, with a single 1-hour break.
* **Commute**: 2 hours daily on the metro, as I couldn‚Äôt afford to live near my office in Business Bay.
* **Salary**: Shamefully low for someone with 4 years of experience in software development.

# Workplace Realities

1. **Cramped Space**: Our office was a tiny 10 m¬≤ room shared by 8‚Äì10 people. Each desk was about 1 m¬≤‚Äîlike the sales desks you see in *The Wolf of Wall Street*.
2. **Bathroom Policy**: You had to check out and back in through the system, and any time spent was deducted from your break.
3. **Leaving on Time**: Finishing work at 6 PM sharp (after 9 hours of grinding) was seen as insubordination. You‚Äôd risk your job if you tried.
4. **Constant Desk Changes**: Every 1‚Äì2 weeks, the micromanager would shuffle our seating within the cramped office to prevent friendships or even casual conversations.
5. **Relentless Coding**: If you stopped typing for more than 60 seconds‚Äîto plan or think strategically‚Äîthe micromanager would show up, questioning why you weren‚Äôt ‚Äúworking.‚Äù
6. **Exploitation at Hiring**: They‚Äôd conduct daily mass interviews, bringing in desperate job seekers‚Äîsometimes making them wait 6‚Äì7 hours‚Äîonly to hire those willing to accept 20% of the standard salary.
7. **Lack of Basic Amenities**: Once, I asked why there wasn‚Äôt coffee for the team. The CEO replied, ‚ÄúIs it mentioned in the contract?‚Äù

There‚Äôs so much more I could share, but I think these examples are enough to give you an idea.

# Who Gets Treated Differently?

In my opinion, only a small percentage of people manage to escape these conditions:

1. **First-World Nationals**: If you‚Äôre from a first-world country, you‚Äôre likely treated better.
2. **Employees at Top Companies**: Working for a globally recognized firm makes a huge difference.
3. **The Lucky Few**: Those who somehow find a fair employer.
4. **Survivors of the System**: People who endure 4+ years in these environments to eventually secure a better opportunity.

Some readers may share their experiences that don‚Äôt match mine and try to place blame on me. I assure you, my experience is not unique‚Äîthis is the reality for 90% of workers in this job market.

Fat Washed Gardenia Mix Recipe:

- Start out by taking 1 1/4 cups of water and 4 sticks of cinnamon and simmering on the stove for 15-20 minutes. Then strain into jar.

- Melt 1 stick of butter and mix with the water in the jar. Then submerged  the mixture in a hot water bath on the stove for 1 hour shaking every 20 minutes.

- Leave it out until room temp and separation occurs. Then put mixture in freezer until top solidifies, break open and strain bottom liquid through a coffee filter.

- Measure weight of liquid and add that amount of cane sugar and honey. Also add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp Allspice dram. Blend together until smooth.

The Pearl Diver is the classic recipe.

- 5 drops Saline Solution 

- 1 oz Orange Juice

- 3/4 oz Lime Juice

- 3/4 oz Fat Washed Gardenia Mix

- 1 tsp Falernum

I was drinking anywhere from 2-5 Monsters a day for the last decade. It got pretty bad, I was even able to drink one before bed with no problem sleeping after. But I started getting horrible migraines and decided to try quitting caffeine to see if it helped. Of course the first week was a nightmare. Caffeine withdrawal headaches were just as bad as the migraines but after the first week things started to mellow out. I still craved caffeine but the headaches were gone. Instead of grabbing monsters on my way to work, I would grab a Sprite. About another 2 weeks, no more cravings.

1i1oj19,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1i1oj19/how_do_bakery_display_showcases_impact_customer/,How do bakery display showcases impact customer buying decisions?,"Bakery display showcases significantly impact customer buying decisions by appealing to the senses, enhancing the shopping experience, and influencing purchasing behavior. Here's how:

# 1. Attracting Customer Attention

* **Visual Appeal**: An aesthetically pleasing showcase with well-organized products draws customers in. Vibrant colors, variety, and symmetry make items more enticing.
* **Lighting**: Well-lit displays highlight the freshness and texture of bakery items, making them look irresistible.
* **Strategic Placement**: Showcases positioned near the entrance or high-traffic areas encourage impulse buying.

# 2. Enhancing Perceived Quality

* **Freshness Emphasis**: Transparent or open displays create a sense of freshness and authenticity, assuring customers of the product‚Äôs quality.
* **Premium Presentation**: High-end designs with polished materials (e.g., glass, stainless steel) communicate sophistication and premium quality.

# 3. Stimulating the Senses

* **Visibility of Ingredients**: Displays showing ingredients or processes (e.g., layers in a cake or fresh bread cooling) trigger curiosity and cravings.
* **Proximity to Aroma**: Placing showcases near areas where the aroma of baked goods wafts out enhances sensory engagement, increasing the likelihood of purchase.

# 4. Encouraging Impulse Purchases

* **Prominent Placement of Bestsellers**: Highlighting popular or seasonal items encourages spontaneous buying.
* **Cross-Selling Opportunities**: Placing complementary products (e.g., cookies next to coffee) boosts sales of related items.
* **Limited-Time Offer Displays**: Showcasing time-sensitive deals or seasonal products creates urgency.

# 5. Organization and Accessibility

* **Category Grouping**: Organizing items by type, flavor, or occasion (e.g., breakfast pastries, celebration cakes) simplifies decision-making.
* **Clear Labeling**: Displaying product names, prices, and key features (e.g., ""gluten-free"" or ""award-winning"") aids informed choices.
* **Accessibility**: Easy-to-reach designs invite customers to explore the offerings more closely.

# 6. Emotional and Social Connection

* **Storytelling Through Design**: Displays that reflect the bakery's story, craftsmanship, or cultural heritage evoke emotional connections.
* **Interactive Displays**: Options like customizable cakes or DIY treat stations engage customers, creating memorable experiences.

# 7. Boosting Brand Image

* **Consistency with Branding**: Showcase designs that align with the bakery‚Äôs branding (e.g., rustic for artisanal bakeries, minimalistic for modern ones) reinforce brand identity.
* **Hygiene and Cleanliness**: Pristine, well-maintained displays reflect professionalism and build customer trust.

# 8. Catering to Diverse Audiences

* **Dietary Inclusivity**: Highlighting sections for vegan, gluten-free, or low-sugar options appeals to health-conscious or niche audiences.
* **Interactive Technology**: Digital displays showing product details, origin, or pairing suggestions appeal to tech-savvy customers.

# Conclusion

A well-designed bakery display showcase isn't just a tool for product presentation‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic element that influences customer perception, drives impulse purchases, and enhances the overall shopping experience.",1,1736911837.0,digimarketeronline,0,1.0,False

I have a mexican passport and a J-1 visa as an intern. I am already in the US and will travel back home in 4 months.

Unfortunately, an almost empy coffee mug spilled inside my bag and caused stains in the corners of my passport, including my current J-1 visa. The visa is in excellent condition, everything is legible, and every security measurement is met. The only detail is the coffee stain in one small corner.

Will this cause an issue when flying back to Mexico? And while being an intern here?

**Plot Idea:** 

Muse A and B were childhood friends. They were inseparable. Their families always thought they would get married. That was Muse A's older brother died. She fell off the deep end. At first it wasn't noticeable as she followed in his footsteps, becoming an army medic. It was only noticeable just how bad things had gotten when she came home. Years battling her drug abuse and bouncing from shelter to shelter. Muse A is pretty sure her life will never get better. Meanwhile, Muse B? He is a rich man who owns a company doing something. They live completely opposite lives. The two lost touch years ago. That is until this Christmas. When Muse B finally agrees to fly home to New York for Christmas. He is not looking forward to being here at all. That is until he runs into the homeless woman holding up the line at the local coffee shop. Can he save her? Maybe, just maybe, she is the reason he is supposed to come home? Their folks always said the two were like magnets, always going to find their way back to each other. 




**Writing Sample** 

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes‚Äîfive minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.


The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left. Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. 


The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrian slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.


That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. 



Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world. ""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. 



Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. 




The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.


PREGNANT.


In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.



All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow. With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa,"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.



Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end everyone with, ""Papa loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.

Few months later he dumped her in what I know; dirty way. so next time after our old friend gathering I told her that my good friend with his family and kids is coming over to stay at my place for the weekend and maybe she wants to join us. Better than staying alone after a breakup in an alien country. 
We spent the time talking and playing with the kids and I was happy to cheer her up.
Late we stayed together watching movies. She picks ""Past lives"",  and ""challengers"" and when watching it: makes my slow brain think: I've been together with the sweetest girl (29F) for the last half year at the time. I never hide it and my ""friend"" knows about it well, but it made me realise that my girlfriend (now just move to living in a better country, and we have to figure out if she come back or I'm dropping all and move after her) does not know that ""friend"" even exists. So i'm sitting there watching ""challengers"" thinking how the fuck I forget to ever mention about it. I was telling my girlfriend about everything what I do... Shortly before that situation I was reading about ""radical honesty"", its make me mention what strange realisation I got to my ""friend"".  It got weird, we talked a bit about our past, that im sorry and that we are good friends and nothing happened. It was 8 months ago.
My girlfriend is pure hearted, always; in word and action doing good for me and also deals patiently with some of my shit, yet when we talk she is not experienced enough with ideas to follow with me; also magic thinking. 
I try to distract myself by traveling (Hit a road for 2 months one with male friend, another with a GF), start going to gym and try to organise my life a bit more  all the time casually talking with my ""friend"", the same as from the last 9 years. 
Inside was worse and worse. I start to have dreams and fantasies. Then the thoughts of how horrible a person I am, then this constant stress, thinking if love of my life just passing by. Amplitude of emotions from love, sadness, anger, constant stress about everything that happened in the world.
Get back to work but feel like an outsider and awkward there. One day not talking with anyone, another day happily joking, then going back home and thinking ""what was that horrible joke, is not funny are you stupid to say that. Better to stay quiet"". Felt that I moved from the position of ""this pleasant little weirdo who sometimes talks funny""  to ""mood swinging weirdo people feel awkward around""
Feeling that friends are slowly growing with their lives away from me (was true also before) because I am talking only about big stuff and are much less witty. Yea! Let's talk about war, politics, morality, AI, and the end of the world...
Three months ago I decided to tell my GF about the situation with a long time friend that I might have feelings about. Idea was to get this off my chest and maybe work it out together because I'm getting crazy.
I showed her documentary about LSD with intend to prepare her for my proposition to trip together next time I visit. Thinking about how important is it to be honest with a person who I want to build with; for deepening our connection, expanding her perspectives, having something awesome together that connects us deeply and creating a safe environment where we are able to resolve growing problem I have together (have no other idea how to even start a conversation like that). On the way back I scheduled a meeting with my ""friend"" to talk about whatever final solution I got. When I visited my GF she just refused. I tell her how awesome it will be to have this experience and it's important but give up after quickly hitting a wall. Fighting with myself I told her about the situation on the last day. She does not take it calmly, let's say. Because of short notice we have no time to talk about it longer than 3 hour. My inability to express in stress do not help. Next day back in country I spend on the scheduled gathering with old friends and ""the"" friend. When asked where we will spend the night; in her place or theirs I picked the other. Great day walking, playing with kids and talking after dinner. What I continue with the ""friend"" till morning with a 2 hour pause where we try to sleep but was not able to, after what we spend talking about the feelings we have and that I talked with my GF about it. I'm not that stupid and know that ""friend"" falls for me too. Probably longer than I. 
Next day we have scheduled meeting all together after our common friends work. Im sleep deprived for the last two nights and in this situation two of us have to kill 10 hour. I have to sleep and no coffee will make me walk around any longer to wait for dinner. Obvious option is going to her place to nap and chill, and I already know in that environment, after what we talk, not able to put mind chains on us there is no power able stop ourselves. After dinner I went back to my town.That was 3 months ago when we last saw each other.
In what I remember as 2-3 days GF called telling she is done and it's over. That she does not want to be in that situation and I have to take myself together. I was able to respond that she was right. I feel that I lose all coherence, all I do is hurt people that are close to me and that I do not know what i'm doing with my life. Do not have a straight agenda going. Talking with my ""friend"" I try to be totally open that i'm in mess right now and have no idea what I'm doing. That i feel a lot of pain and guilt and have no idea what my motivation are. That maybe im a really bad person, just fucking around, that I feel for her but at the same time want to have children and ( i google it) at her age chances are low even if we start right now. What if in few years I start regretting that i'm not able to fulfill life how I imagine. Then it hit me that I treat love partner as a breeding machine and it make me a monster.
""Friend"" show a lot of support, send me a book how to ground myself. I told her that maybe we can try LSD together to work this out and she said yes. She educated herself and sent me some articles and research about psychedelics she found interesting. Meantime I was about to give back my GF her stuff, we talked and she said that we can be back. All she wants is to stop talking with the ""friend"" and I lied that I will do it, knowing at the time I'm not able to imagine ""friend"" out of my life. Not sure why I did this, maybe feel of duty or too ashamed to tell her in person ""No"", already at the time i felt to lose any controll on this rolecoster.  Next two weeks I have a fight with myself trying to find any possible solution out of this stalemate.We talked about my doubts and ""friend"" said ""you have just to pick anything and stick to it to have peace"". Two months and 7 days ago I picked my GF.
Fuck it anything just get out from this place. Do not know why, maybe duty? Maybe children I'm not sure if I want anymore. Whatever: ""stick to it and it will go away"". I told my ""friend"" about the situation and decision. She said that it hurt her a lot more than the last breakup and was cheering the prospect of being with me. That she need me but I chose another and now preferable solution is to not contact her again but its my decision. I told we should proceed with what she proposes (I feel like I want to jump out of my skin writing this). 
And that was the last time we had contact. I reread our last messages many times thinking about writing something but try my best to stick to the deal. 
I try to keep myself together from the outside hear a story from my coworker that her daughter dealing with her best friend jumping under the train, that close to her person just got recognised with dangerous cancer and i was hiding two tears I was not able to stop, barely keeping myself from crying like a baby at work. Other coworker family house is lost in a flood and his fiance family home half burnt month after, my other friend have a suecide attempt from what he said  bad drugs causing paranoja. I have all good and create problems myself when there are people with independent crysis dealing with it. Thought that make me even more shitty.
I relapse to smoking (i'm smoking only sometimes for the last 8 years) and exceed use of alcohol and drugs. Sometimes spending nights watching YT sipping cocktail of drugs to keep my brain working on 30% only to stay calm. 
My GF visit and we spend a few days together. I try to open/connect and talk a lot about what going through my head (war; moral relativism; my conversation with jewish nationalist; problems other people have.) i brought a topic of this ""friend"" of mine but she does not want to know about it. I asked why she want to be with me and she said ""You make me feel like home"" and its exactly the same response I got from my ex. I mention to have a hard breakup at the beginning of this story. When she press me on that same question and I asked ""and you?"". 
We went thro days cycling around ideas; our relation; what we want. I hear that its totally new to her to talk about stuff like that and in her family all just suck it in. I picked for us to watch ""Before trilogy"" what Im familiar with the first part only and want to watch from some time already. Great movies I felt extremely that make my tear and give us some example we follow when talking next two days.
After I decided to calm myself and propose to stop and just enjoy ourself. It work out and i find peace first time in last 8 months for 3 days before she left. Give me a recommendation of two movies she watched recently ""perfect days"" which bring a bit of peace in me and ""We live in time"" which made me cry a lot.
I notice 4 days back that my ""friend"" deleted her facebook. I guess its part of the healing process on her side but is make me worried. I want reach to check on her, I want to reach to her anyways. Stopping myself for now, not to break the deal and heeling but my fear grow and grow.
Yesterday after work I went to my boss and said that I want to change and will quit job somewhere before october.
My plan for today was to eat 200ug LSD alone at the morning as last resort to get out from this paralysis I got (last time trip around 3 years back). After a night of little sleep and drinking ‚â§0.7L (24 ounces) of vodka during the night mixed sometimes with amphetamine, I woke up to cry in my room for next 3 hour during what I decided was no way good idea to trip at day like that.
Instead decided to write all that mess down. It took me 16 hour of walking around, thinking about my life, correcting my broken english, drinking another +0.7L (24 ounces) vodka. I do not feel sane, changing decision what to do frequently. I really thought to be to old for stuff like that.

1i1o1ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1i1o1ul/mentally_ill_guest_deleted_her_crazy_messages_new/,Mentally ill guest deleted her crazy messages [new Airbnb feature],"I discovered something new today. Apparently, Airbnb has a new feature that allows guests to delete/unsend messages. How problematic especially when a guest incriminates themselves and then decides to retract it 

BACKGROUND:

I currently have a 1 month booking with a female guest. Her husband booked it for her. Shortly after she arrived, she insisted on meeting me to ask some questions about the property. She had no relevant questions on the property and just wanted my phone number. How strange? Why did I waste my time to go there just to give my number whenever it‚Äôs already on the app

This was a big mistake because she started calling me on a daily basis with matters that were non urgent or totally off the wall. She called to ask me to remove the coffee maker and toaster from the property. When I asked why, she said she saw a cockroach inside the toaster. I sensed this was BS because I had already detected some crazy in her when I met her. Sure enough, I came the next day to collect the toaster and there was just a bread crumb. She must have been hallucinating thinking the bread crumb was a cock roach. 

Besides this, her mannerisms and behavior are exhibiting signs of schizophrenia. She talks to herself, flaps her hands in the air and appears to be hallucinating. She does not sleep since she enters and exits the house every 30 mins - 1 hour to smoke. She has been doing this for the past week. I honestly don‚Äôt know how she is still alive and am concerned she will hurt herself and damage the property.  

Today, the neighbor called and said she went to their backyard and was looking through their window. The neighbor said the guest said she is staying next door with her little daughter. There is no daughter. She is staying by herself 

This is the most bizarre experience we have ever had. 

All this to say, through this experience, we also discovered a new feature that allows guests to delete their messages. When we confronted her husband who booked the property , the wife apparently had access to his account and replied. She sent a series of disgruntled and incoherent messages. Those messages were later deleted by her husband when Airbnb support called him following our complaint.  I asked the Airbnb agent how the messages were deleted. He said this was a new feature Airbnb rolled out. 

My plan is to speak to the husband and come to agreement to end the reservation asap. If he does not agree, I will ask Airbnb to step in. Since I‚Äôm dealing with a crazy person, it has to be dealt with delicately. Fortunately, based on the messages , the husband sounds reasonable but was very careless to offload his problems on us. Not cool. ",26,1736910288.0,airbnb_hosts,17,0.93,False

Pet Friendly too!

Hi there! I‚Äôm looking for someone to take over my lease starting March 14th, 2025. This is a bright, spacious 1-bedroom, 1-bathroom, 11th-floor apartment in the amazing Cambridge Crossing (CX) neighborhood. The lease runs through July 28th, 2025, and the rent is $3,300/month‚Äîthe kicker is I locked in a slightly lower rate when I signed my lease, so you‚Äôll be saving money compared to renting this same unit directly through the leasing office.

I‚Äôve absolutely loved living here, and I‚Äôm only moving because I‚Äôm relocating to Austin in March. If I could bring this place with me, I would!

What makes this place so great?

\- Location, location: It‚Äôs just steps from the Lechmere Green Line stop, making it super easy to get anywhere‚Äîdowntown Boston, Kendall Square, or wherever else you need to go.

\- Bright and open: Big floor-to-ceiling windows flood the space with natural light, and the layout feels airy and functional.

\- Spacious bathroom: The bathroom is bigger than what you‚Äôll typically find in apartments around here, with plenty of counter space and storage to keep everything organized.

Modern features:

\- In-unit washer and dryer.

\- Stainless steel appliances and a big kitchen island (perfect for cooking or just hanging out).

\- Climate-controlled heating and cooling for year-round comfort.

\- A great neighborhood vibe: CX is packed with parks, coffee shops, restaurants, and grocery stores, all just a short walk away.

\- Also, if you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôm willing to part with some of the furniture! This could be a great option if you‚Äôre looking to move in without having to worry about furnishing the place right away.

\- Attached garage with EV charging! Separate fee.

To help sweeten the deal, I‚Äôm happy to offer a ""signing bonus"" to make your transition smoother‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs helping with moving costs or another little incentive. Let‚Äôs chat and figure something out!

This is an incredible opportunity to lock in a lower rent for an awesome apartment in one of the most convenient and vibrant neighborhoods in Cambridge. If you‚Äôre interested, send me a message! I‚Äôm happy to answer questions or set up a time for you to come check it out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a mini home kitchen can be an exciting challenge. When space is limited, every inch counts. With the right strategies, you can design a kitchen that is not only functional but also stylish and efficient. Here are some space-saving solutions and tips to help you get the most from your mini kitchen.

### Maximizing Vertical Space

When you have a small kitchen, think upward. Utilize your walls to add storage and style. Here are some ideas:

- **Open Shelving:** Open shelves create an airy feel and provide easy access to your dishes and cookware. They also allow you to showcase decorative items.
- **Wall-Mounted Racks:** A wall-mounted rack can hold pots, pans, and utensils. It keeps them within reach while saving precious counter space.
- **Hanging Baskets:** Consider hanging baskets for fruits and vegetables. They save counter space and add a pop of color.

### Choosing Compact Appliances

In a mini kitchen, the right appliances make all the difference. Opt for compact versions to save space without sacrificing functionality.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mini-home-kitchen  
  
- **Combination Appliances:** Look for appliances that serve multiple functions, like a microwave that also bakes or an oven with a built-in air fryer.
- **Under-Counter Refrigerators:** These refrigerators save space, leaving more room for cooking and prep work.
- **Dishwashers:** If you have room, a small, integrated dishwasher can save both time and counter space, eliminating the need for drying racks.

### Multi-Functional Furniture

Another clever way to maximize space is through multi-functional furniture. You can choose items that serve dual purposes, thus reducing clutter.

- **Convertible Tables:** A foldable dining table can easily tuck away when not in use, providing extra space for cooking or prepping meals.
- **Storage Ottomans:** An ottoman can serve as seating and also offer hidden storage for kitchen items like tablecloths or napkins.
- **Kitchen Islands on Wheels:** A movable kitchen island can be a great addition. You can push it aside when you need space or roll it closer during meal prep.

### Smart Storage Solutions

Storage in a mini kitchen is all about creativity. Here are some innovative storage tips:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mini-home-kitchen  
  
- **Drawer Organizers:** Use dividers in your drawers for utensils and tools. Organizing these items helps maximize space and efficiency.
- **Lazy Susans:** In corners or cabinets, lazy Susans can make it easier to access spices, oils, or small cans with a simple spin.
- **Magnetic Strips:** Install magnetic strips on the walls or inside cabinet doors for knives or metal utensils. This keeps them off the counters and easily accessible.

### Lighting Tips

Good lighting can make a small kitchen feel more open and welcoming. Here are a few tips:

- **Under-Cabinet Lighting:** Brighten your work areas with under-cabinet lighting. This not only adds functionality but also enhances the style of your kitchen.
- **Natural Light:** Keep window coverings light and airy. Natural light can open up the space and create a warm atmosphere.
- **Reflective Surfaces:** Use reflective materials for countertops or backsplashes to make the space feel larger.

### Colors and Materials

Choosing the right colors and materials can also influence how spacious your mini kitchen feels. Light colors can help to expand the perception of space.

- **Soft Hues:** Opt for whites, light grays, or pastels. These tones can brighten the space and give a more open feel.
- **Consistent Palettes:** Keeping a cohesive color scheme from the cabinets to the countertop can create a unified look that makes the kitchen feel larger.
- **Glass Elements:** Incorporate glass in cabinets or shelves. This prevents visual clutter and maintains an open aesthetic.

Designing an efficient mini home kitchen may seem daunting, but with strategic planning and creative thinking, you can create a space that meets all your needs without sacrificing style. Focus on innovative storage, smart furniture choices, and effective lighting to make your mini kitchen a delightful culinary space. Embrace the challenge and enjoy your cooking in a beautifully designed environment!

Essential Appliances for a Functional Mini Home Kitchen: What You Need
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a mini home kitchen can be both an enjoyable and practical endeavor. Whether you live in a small apartment, a tiny house, or just want a cozy cooking area, certain appliances are essential to make your space functional and efficient. Below are key appliances that can elevate your mini kitchen experience.

### Compact Refrigerator

Your mini kitchen needs a compact refrigerator. It keeps your food fresh without taking up too much floor space. Look for models with adjustable shelves and an energy-efficient rating. This way, you can store everything from perishable items to beverages while managing your electricity bill effectively.

### Multi-Cooker

Consider investing in a multi-cooker. These versatile appliances can perform various tasks, including pressure cooking, slow cooking, saut√©ing, and steaming. With a multi-cooker, you can whip up soups, stews, and even desserts in one device. This not only saves space but also reduces the number of dishes you need to wash!

### Induction Cooktop

If you don‚Äôt have space for a full stove, an induction cooktop is a fantastic alternative. It heats quickly, is easy to clean, and gives you precise control over cooking temperatures. Induction cooktops are also energy-efficient, making them an excellent choice for a mini kitchen setup.

### Microwave Oven

A microwave oven remains a staple in any kitchen, mini or otherwise. It‚Äôs perfect for quick heating, defrosting, and even cooking certain meals. Opt for a model with a grill function to add versatility to your mini kitchen. This allows you to bake and brown food effectively.

### Toaster Oven

Consider adding a toaster oven to your appliance collection. Unlike traditional toasters, toaster ovens can bake, broil, and toast. They can help you prepare quick meals without needing to use the larger oven. This is especially helpful in saving time and energy in a compact setting.

### Food Processor

A food processor can be a game-changer. It allows you to chop, slice, dice, and blend with ease. This can significantly cut down your meal prep time. Look for a model that fits comfortably on your countertop yet is powerful enough to handle tougher tasks, like kneading dough or chopping nuts.

### Coffee Maker

If you‚Äôre a coffee lover, a compact coffee maker is a must-have. Choose a single-serve model if you have limited counter space. This way, you can enjoy a fresh cup of coffee every morning without cluttering your kitchen.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mini-home-kitchen  
  
### Electric Kettle

An electric kettle is an efficient way to boil water quickly. Plus, it‚Äôs not just for tea; you can use it for instant soups, oatmeal, or even for cooking pasta. Some models come with temperature control settings, which is helpful for different types of teas or coffee.

### Blender

A high-quality blender should also be part of your mini kitchen arsenal. It‚Äôs perfect for smoothies, sauces, and soups. Look for a powerful yet compact model that will fit seamlessly into your kitchen but still perform like a full-sized blender.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mini-home-kitchen  
  
### Space-Saving Tips

When you're working with limited space, consider these tips:

- **Vertical Storage:** Use shelves to take advantage of vertical space.
- **Magnetic Strips:** Attach a magnetic strip to hold knives or metal utensils.
- **Collapsible Items:** Look for collapsible bakeware or storage options that can save space when not in use.
- **Under-Sink Organizers:** Maximize under-sink spaces for cleaning supplies and other kitchen items.

Equipping your mini home kitchen with the right appliances doesn't have to feel overwhelming. By focusing on essential items that serve multiple purposes, you can create a functional cooking environment that meets your needs without filling your space with unnecessary gadgets. Consider your cooking style, available space, and how you plan to use your mini kitchen to choose the best appliances for you.

 Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/mini-home-kitchen  
  
By investing in these essential appliances, you‚Äôll create a workspace that's not only practical but enjoyable. Happy cooking!

### Conclusion

Creating a mini home kitchen combines creativity with practicality, transforming small spaces into functional culinary havens. By focusing on space-saving design solutions, such as vertical storage and multifunctional furniture, you can maximize every nook and cranny. For instance, installing shelves above countertops or using a rolling cart can significantly enhance your cooking and preparation areas without feeling cramped. Choosing the right color palette and lighting also contributes to an open, inviting ambiance.

When it comes to essential appliances, it's crucial to prioritize those that offer versatility and efficiency. A compact yet powerful refrigerator, a multi-cooker for quick meal prep, and a space-saving microwave can make all the difference. Investing in quality over quantity ensures you have all the tools you need without overwhelming your limited space. Look for appliances that not only meet your cooking needs but also add to the aesthetic of your mini kitchen.

I am back and I am happy to see to it. Mostly. I have some reservations:

1. Why do they need to serve food? That too whole curries in some places. I went to Roast in Hyderabad and my host recommended me the nihari without batting a eye. The strong smell of spices interferes with the aroma of coffee. Possibly, along the same lines, not every place needs loud music.

2. What about Indian and non-European styles of coffee that would possibly go better with the Indian palette? I want to see Malabar Monsoon as filter kapi, I want to see a strong Arabica as Turkish coffee prepared over a bed of sand possibly with a cardamom pod. You get the gist.

3. Where is the innovation in the beans? A huge ass roaster cannot solve your problem if you do not have interesting beans. I think the really acidic stuff lightly roasted could also go well with the Indian palette.

4. Finally, given that it is largely a very warm country, cold brew innovations should be looked into more. Like the nitro stuff is awesome. It feels like this should already be here; maybe I am not looking at the right places. So finally context:

I looked around mostly in Kolkata. Only Roastery and Blue Tokai make the cut. I'd love to hear about other interesting places around the country. Especially ones which invalidates my complaints. Cheers,",8,1736909910.0,IndiaCoffee,9,0.9,False

I've been living on this subreddit along with all of the Facebook groups as I try to choose an AI for my husband and I. We're looking for 5 or 6 nights away in Mexico (likely Cancun/RM but open to Puerto Vallarta area too). Our budget is under 4k (ish) for just the resort, not including flights. I've seen all of the YouTube walkthroughs, read so many reviews, and I know that no resort is perfect, especially without an unlimited budget. That said, I'm hoping that crowdsourcing opinions helps me settle on the best one for us :)

About us: late 20s, first trip away since our daughter was born last fall. Not looking to party but we do enjoy good food and craft cocktails. Nightlife/entertainment isn't really important to us. We also know that AI food is never Michelin star and our expectations aren't fine dining. Just good quality food that's served at the proper temp and tastes good! Variety is less important if quality is good. Would love a resort that's well maintained and has a nice aesthetic, but cleanliness and facility maintenance is definitely more important than \~vibe\~. Most of the day we want to relax on the beach and be served drinks and chips/guac haha. Bonuses but not must haves would be: a coffee shop as I love iced lattes, golf course onsite or nearby for my husband, yoga for me, a nice gym, fresh smoothies/seasonal tropical fruit available, beach cabanas available for non-club level members, and/or some sort of environmentally friendly initiative. We're drawn to smaller, more boutique resorts but understand that we may not end up with one and that's okay. My perfect resort would be if Beloved had more of a Tulum vibe and Atelier food/drink. I know that's unrealistic haha.

Here are the resorts I'm currently waffling between (I also welcome other suggestions!)

* Secrets Playa Blanca Costa Mujeres: would be around $4200 for a standard king room. Love the aesthetic and that it's newer, and Secrets is a very reputable brand. Food reviews seem great too! Bigger than I'd like but willing to sacrifice intimate size for everything else.
* Joia Paraiso: We'd be able to stay in the ocean-front walkout for $3800 which would be amazing. I love the idea of waking up, having coffee on the patio while looking at the beach, and then walking straight out to the pool/breakfast/beach. Joia portion is smaller at 300ish rooms. Food and recent resort updates seem promising, aesthetic is a little more vegas-y than I'd like but not a deal breaker. The onsite golf course is well known which is a plus. We wouldn't likely venture into the other areas of Iberostar. Also love their recent eco initiatives.
* Excellence Playa Mujeres or Riviera Cancun: PM would be around 4k for a basic room, and we could do Excellence Club swim out for a similar price at RC. Have heard mixed reviews on which location is better and would prefer to have the swimsuit at Riviera but not if the resort isn't worth the price. DOn't love how big it is but again, not a deal breaker. Don't want to do the new costa Mujeres location because I think May will be too close to opening for all the kinks to be worked out (Sadly, because it looks like it will be beautiful!)
* Mahekal Beach Resort: around $3800 - absolutely love the relaxed, boho vibe and smaller size. Bonus that we could walk into PDC and bop around to shops. Beach is public so not sure if we'd be able to relax fully, since that would depend on how crowded it is. Also not sure if the lack of dining variety (only 2-3 restaurants that are all mexican/american/seafood) would be a con, though the food and drinks they do have seem to be very well rated.
* Armony Marival in Puerto Vallarta: Around 4k for an Oceanview room. Love the aesthetic, the infinity pool, the size (80 rooms), and the geography of Puerto Vallarta with the mountains and beach. I'm aware that the tide can really affect how much beach there is to relax on, which is a potential con. I'm also unsure if there's enough food variety at this resort, and if the food is up to our hopes. Haven't heard a ton about it in general.

We've ruled out all other Secrets locations and Atelier due to budget. Unico isn't much of a beach resort, so that's out. Beloved has too many mixed reviews on both food and facility updates needed so it's out, although I love the idea of it!

If you've read this far, thank you! This group has been so helpful and I'm looking forward to hearing feedback from you all, be it resorts you'd suggest instead, or reviews on the ones I've listed. Thanks again!",3,1736909786.0,AllInclusiveResorts,1,1.0,False

My TOTGA had been married for around 6 years I believe. We remain good friends as we used to check up on each other from time to time. 

When I found out that she was back in the country, I reached out to her & asked her out to catchup. We hadn't seen each other for almost a decade narin. To which she agreed. Nothing happened between us, it's purely kwentuhan lang talaga. We ate, drank coffee, & spoke for a little over 12 hours.

While we were conversing, I remembered how it felt those times na magkasama kami. On the duration ng aming catchup, I was really torn whether or not to tell her how i truly felt about her back then. This was despite me knowing na happily married na siya. Kumbaga gusto ko lang ipalabas sa dibdib ko what has been there for such a long time. Di ako umamin sa kanya back then kasi wala pa akong napatunayan sa sarili ko, She has been well off since while ako naman starting pa sa career ko. When she told me before na may boyfriend na siya *(her husband na ngayon)*, it was over a phone call, I felt genuinely happy for her but sad for myself. 

So ayun na nga, I ended up not telling her how i truly felt back then kasi ayaw ko maging awkward ang mga future interactions namin. I wanted to keep the friendship. I respect her & her marriage with her husband so as to not tell her what I felt about her over a decade ago. I am content & happy with my decision. Ika nga, past is past.

I couldn't see my doctor, so I went back to 0.5, and got sick for 1 day. I feel better today.

I will admit I ate too much of the wrong foods, which most likely made me sick.

I saw my doctor today, and have been advised to cut back to 0.25 for 4 weeks, then go to 0.5...

My question is, has anybody else done this or had success? My doctor left the choice to me if I want to quit or not. She thinks i should keep going.I don't want to give up yet, but I can't miss anymore work (5 days in 2 weeks) do to uncontrollable vomiting and diarrhea.

It's evident i won't be able to tolerate 1mg, and iv read it won't even work under 1mg.

Do I stay the course? Or do I except it not for me.

Also, assuming I'm going to give it one last chance (along as symptoms are manageable/no more lost work) what do you eat?

I can't do coffee anymore. Everything was going great, eating everything I did before (good and bad) but about half the amount, but now I'm so scared to eat in fear I'll wake up sick, call in, and lose my job.

I don‚Äôt know how else to start this other than jumping in - I am completely and utterly finished with sales. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I am currently working in what some consider a cushy job, and I just can‚Äôt deal with it anymore. I do account management currently in the hospitality sector, I sell towels and stuff to hotels. Basically every single thing including the art on the walls, coffee in the lobby, and the spigot in the bath. Need to have items, I work in the biggest company for this in the sector, and no prospecting.

I‚Äôm good at my job. I grew my 3.1 million dollar portfolio last year into a 4.6 million dollar portfolio this year. I have the most strategic portfolio in this sector at this company for this brand. I make like 40 phone calls and emails per day combined. However‚Ä¶ I just cannot take the constant corporate bullshit any longer. Checking in with deals on a weekly basis that take months (or even years) to close, constant micro-managing in ways that I was *assured* this company *totally hates,* and now, we‚Äôre suddenly going back into office. 

But more than that, I have been in sales for nearly two decades. I‚Äôve been a BDR, SDR, AE, ISR, AM, I‚Äôve been in car sales, phone sales, insurance sales, construction sales, home improvement sales, food sales, advertising sales, I‚Äôve worked in the government sector, apartment housing sector, healthcare supplies sector, and now hospitality sector. I‚Äôve been a sales manager in multiple industries, I‚Äôve done cold calling, door to door, ‚Äúeat your kill‚Äù and everything else. 

I know everyone says this, but I was always great. If not number 1, I was number 2. I feel now that I would rather drag myself pants-less, taint first through a field of broken glass than to schmooze up to the next big kahuna for even one more millisecond to get my commission. I‚Äôm over the big trips and massive hotels and just the general atmosphere of it all. I‚Äôm done. I seriously cannot motivate myself to do this anymore. 

Problem is, I have a family. They rely on my income. I really don‚Äôt think I can do this anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have taken all my time off that I just renewed in January because I went on Christmas vacation and just couldn‚Äôt come back. I don‚Äôt have a degree. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

1i1ninw,https://v.redd.it/f6hnaip0l2de1,Made it out of Florida...,"Everyone's writing stories now so I'm gonna try too  

1/11: Gainesville, Florida. Need to get to Jacksonville to catch a train. Don't like to hitchhike, so going to take the county shuttle bus. Find a camp by the bus stop, ask if I can stay the night. These guys are cool! Give em some spare socks and gloves, they give me a couple smokes. One guy's telling stories about how we kicked the Nazis asses during WWII. They got a garbage bag of Christmas candy that the dollar tree threw out. Good times.  

1/12: Wake up, bird shits on my blanket, another one shits on my hand. Preferable to rain. Clean up, talk with the folks at camp. One guy is off to fly a sign, one guy's off to the food bank. Make myself scarce and go to the bus stop. Bus shows up at 3:30pm. It's free, too.  

Arrive in Palatka, Florida that evening. Run to Dollar General to resupply. Go back to the bus stop. No security, no cameras, no foot traffic... decide to sleep here. See some folks walking into the trees. Consider looking for camp, but they're talking to themselves. Don't want to deal with tweakers. Fall asleep late.  

1/13: Wake up to my alarm at 5:30am, bus comes in 30 minutes. Barely got any sleep. Wait for the bus. Hop on the bus. Dropped at Jacksonville! Look at maps to find a hopout. Get on a bus to the yards. Halfway through the ride, it starts pissing down rain. Phone says it's gonna be raining til 9pm. Fuck.  

10:00am. Go to McDonalds. Get a coffee and plug in my phone charger. Am I gonna have to stay here for 10 hours? Christian rock is playing in the store. Time to settle in...  

12:00pm. Guy walks in. Got a small backpack and a sleeping bag. Asks me where I'm from. Tell him I'm trying to get to Atlanta. He is too! Says he's hopped out of Jacksonville six times. Ask to come along with him, he agrees.  

Now we're both sitting in McDonalds. Forecast says rain ends at 10pm. Now it says 7pm. Now it says 5:30pm? Me and him get to talking. He's been riding for 10 years. Old-school kind of hobo. I like him. I'm young but I ain't no oogle.  

5:00pm. Rain lets up, phones are charged, we hit the road. Fifteen minutes into walking and it starts pissing rain again. Hide under an awning by a funeral home. We get to talking again. Sharing stories. He drinks a lot. He's stunned I don't drink or do drugs. That's the usual reaction...  

7:00pm. Rain lets up, for real this time. Get to walking. Get under a bridge. Miss a ride. Get on the next one. Gettin' cozy under a pig. Then the train starts moving.  

Whole time I'm thinking, ""this guy seems trustworthy, but what's the catch?"" We start talking about Atlanta. He says it's a bad, bad city. I ask why. What he said doesn't need to be repeated... but he had a lot of things to say about black folks and used very colorful language in doing so.  

Okay, this guy's racist. Racist as fuck. Think about throwing him off the train. Decide to stop thinking like an oogle. Now he's arguing with his old lady on the phone, screaming and shouting. At least this is a quick ride?  

1/14: It wasn't a quick ride. Went for 14 hours, sided out quite a few times. Guy's sending voice messages to his girl the whole time. Always yelling. At least he likes me...  

Arrive in Atlanta. We go to the corner store, buy our respective drinks. He wants to be buddies, I really don't... He's gotta start walking south. I gotta start walking north. We finally part ways.  

Walk three miles to the Amtrak station. Got a bus ticket to NOLA tomorrow morning. Only $28! That's a fucking steal. Station is open for a couple more hours. I can charge my phone before setting up camp.  

I don't know the moral of this story, but I sure am glad to be moving again :)

A couple days ago, I got into a really big fight with my parents that lead into my mom saying that I just ‚Äúclock in and out‚Äù and how I‚Äôm basically not doing my job. Keep in mind, I open the front basically everyday and she doesn‚Äôt visit the restaurant everyday to see the work I‚Äôm doing.

Additionally, she was going to get upset at my dad, but my dad shifted the entire blame onto me so he doesn‚Äôt hear it from my mom (for background, I tried reaching out to my dad about instructions for using a new coffee maker and he never responded to my calls or texts. Moments later my parents came in and my mom said I always need to make the coffee first. Told her I texted my dad for instructions and she was about to get upset at him, then my dad proceeded to say that I should‚Äôve known depite it being a brand new coffee machine) Both of my parents continued to verbally degrade my work and yell at me for not doing my job correctly even though I ASKED for instructions. All of this rooted from me asking how to do my job correctly to operate a stupid coffee machine

After the argument, I frustratedly cried in the bathroom and tried pushing through work. My girlfriend visited me to be there for me emotionally, and before she left, my mom told her that I need to toughen up if I wanted to take care of the business and that was my last straw. Since I was a kid, my parents have always suppressed my emotions and told me to get over things, so as an adult, I barely even express emotions out of fear. I hate to cry around my parents because this is the reaction I normally get, is to ‚Äútoughen up ‚Äú and to stop being soft. It‚Äôs a disrespect to me, my masculinity, and my line of work and I‚Äôm so sick of this. I feel undervalued and underappreciated for my work. I haven‚Äôt gotten a good job or thank you since the grand opening

Trying to resolve conflict with them is even worse. My mom hates when I‚Äôm emotional so if I try communicating, it ends up as an argument no matter how I approach her, same thing with my dad. I feel trapped in my emotions. 

I think I‚Äôm just so emotional about this because I feel so underappreciated by both of my parents and it‚Äôs been like that since a child. I‚Äôve sacrificed a lot for this establishment, so for both of them to disrespect my masculinity and emotions really drew the line",3,1736908334.0,GuyCry,11,1.0,False

1i1ncde,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i1ncde,Aerobic Septic System Recommendations ,"Here are my personal thoughts on what a new owner should know when moving into a house with an aerobic system. 

First my background, I have grown up in the industry and have been working for about 13 years full time doing maintenance and repairs on aerobic systems in Texas. I work on Jet, Aqua Aire, Aqua Safe, Nuwater, Clearstream, Biomicrobic, FujiClean, Hoot and a couple of other brands. They all have their pros and cons but my preference is the Jet and FujiClean systems due to some design elements that seem to work well on residential systems.

When I talk to a new customer I try to explain that the 2 most important things they need to do is limit the hydraulic and organic overloading. So spread out your water usage and don't use the garbage disposal. 

We ask homeowners to not do more than 3 load of laundry in a 24 hour period and to not shower while the washing machine is running. It is also best not to take more than 1 shower at a time or drain a huge jacuzzi tub all at once. The main thing to keep in mind with hydraulic overloading is that the septic is a maze that is designed to accumulate solids in the early chambers so that the last chamber stays cleaner longer and the system needs to be pumped out less frequently, saving you money and headache. 

When it comes to organic overloading, I tell customers that the bacteria likes to have its food in its simplest form and your body does a wonderful job at that. Your garbage disposal shouldn't be used except for the small stuff that doesn't scrape off into the trash can. Greases fats and oils should never go into a system because the take a lot of oxygen to break down and will overload the bacteria causing the system to smell and have poor treatment. 

Septic systems should be pumped every 2-5 years depending on your usage but I've seen a customer require a pump out twice a year because they don't want to change their lifestyle and the same brand could go 7-8 years without needing it for a family that follows the recommendations very closely. We don't pump out systems and I don't get a kickback from pump companies that I refer out to, we try to give at least 3 referrals for pumping so the homeowner can choose who they use. When I tell someone to get the system pumped it's because that is what is needed.

Of course there are tons of products that can kill the bacteria so you want to keep them out of the system. Some that come to mind are:
-Drain clearing chemicals 
-Medicine and antibiotics 
-Pesticides
-Paints
-Household chemicals 
-Antibacterial soap
-Bleach
-Citrus products 
-Wated softener discharge 
-Liquid fabric softener 

Things that I fish out of systems that don't break down and clog up pumps should also not go into the system. 
-Female hygiene products 
-Cigarette butts
-Disposable diapers 
-Any wet wipe (even the ""flushable"" ones)
-Rags 
-Paper towels 
-Bandages
-Gloves
-Procreatives (please quit flushing your condoms)

Monthly additives are a waste of money for 90% of customers because your gut has all the bacteria your septic needs. 

Talk to your maintenance tech and learn about your system. At least know where the mute switch is on your control panel and it doesn't hurt to build a good relationship with the company that does your scheduled maintenance. I believe an educated customer is our best customer and can typically help us diagnose over the phone to ease your mind before we can get a tech out to do full diagnostics. You should know where your control panel, tanks, and drain field are located on your property and know that you can't build or bark over that area. Please don't plant trees around them either because it's only a matter of time before roots find their way into the tank and cause backups eventually. ",6,1736908060.0,septictanks,4,0.88,False

TL;DR: Newly diagnosed, having multiple anaphylactic flares a day, doctor won't help.

So I was diagnosed with MCAS by an allergist two months ago because I started having anaphylactic reactions to coffee, which I typically drank several of every day. Cutting coffee out stopped that for a while.

Cut to last Tuesday, when I started having several anaphylactic reactions a day. Full body mottled skin/hives, swollen face and neck, tongue swelling up, throat getting scratchy. Taking a dose of two Benadryl seems to keep it at bay for a while. I figured out on Friday that I was reacting to caffeine, so I cut out all caffeine immediately. But it flares up so many times a day that by the end of the day, I've usually had to take 8 Benadryl.

When I called my allergist, who is consistently spectacularly useless, she said ""I wish there was something I could tell you to help, but you should go see a \*dermatologist\*."" Then she said that she was sure it wasn't something that I was eating, like I had told her that I suspected, because ""that doesn't really happen."" When I reminded her that I had developed the allergy to coffee, she said that that ""wasn't really something that happens"" and ""like I said, you need to see a dermatologist."" Which isn't really going to help a systemic issue now is it.

Meanwhile, I don't know if it's just because my bucket is overflowing, but I'm having multiple flares a day, every day, and I have no medical professional helping me, so I'm just winging it. I'm reacting to every liquid I drink that's not water, and then I reacted to chocolate just now, which I suppose makes sense because it has a small amount of caffeine?

I'm not asking for medical advice over the internet, but I feel like I'm drowning here and it's getting exhausting and scary. Any words of advice? Any resources that would help someone newly diagnosed? I'm desperate, so anything helps. Thank you! I appreciate you reading this <3

ETA: I don't think I understand the bucket. Can someone explain it to me? Once it gets full and starts pouring over... what happens then? Do I need to do something to get it back to normal? ty",1,1736908053.0,MCAS,7,1.0,False

I swat at the fleabag furiously.

Its wrinkled oily skin leaves stains on my clothes.

It sinks its teeth into my hand

like I owe it my blood.

Sometimes I can wrench it off

while I eat breakfast.

\-

It tails me too closely across town,

tracking me down

in every shop queue

to hang around my neck

like a weight

or a noose.

It doesn't release me

until I've given it a pot of coffee

and something dripping with grease

or loaded with sugar.

\-

It sits with me at work

breathing heavily

and jerking off to itself

in the reflection of my computer screen

as I try to look busy

when all of the important tasks are finished.

\-

It likes to join conversations with my coworkers¬†

halfway through.

It whispers nasty comments

about their teeth

how they could afford to lose 20 pounds

and do they know how shrill

their laughter is?

I look at my phone,

and it cowers pitifully next to me, shrinking.

\-

When I pack my things to go home,

it disappears suddenly.

I hit the gas and check my rearview mirror,

I see it closing in behind me.

\-

I try to focus on the road.

With its hot breath on my neck,

it shouts at me over my favorite song

that I have listened to that song

a few too many times and‚Äì

it is right in my ear‚Äì

shouldn't you be a little more interesting by now?

\-

When I sit down to eat dinner,

it points out how my boyfriend

chews too loudly

leaves the lights on

says the wrong words.

I find myself less in love with him

when it gnaws on my calf beneath the table

with the tenacity of a dog

that has been starving for weeks.

\-

As I lie down to sleep,

Boredom, its belly bulging,

creeps out of my room and into my kitchen,

spoiling my forgotten week-old grapes

with its lecherous touch

and it crawls back to whatever hole it sleeps in at night.

USGS has the largest collection of overinflated egos out of any agency I've worked for. 

I remember meeting this guy when I was in college that was so full of himself because he was a hydro tech.

There are some good technicians, but most of them are ass and have no business in the field.  Even the bad ones have this pompous demeanor like they're better than everyone because they work for USGS, meanwhile ""they don't feel comfortable in a boat""

The technicians aren't even scientists, we literally are just maintenance workers that change batteries and install sensors.

Then the supervisor is like this super neurotic micromanager that watches real-time data Sunday morning with his coffee and has a conniption if your site goes down.

So then you gotta race out and change a battery because god forbid you lose a day of data, as if we can't interpolate from the years prior.
....

So then you have the ""Studies"" section where the ""real"" scientists work.  Half them are just average people with crappy masters degrees from low tier universities that have been working at USGS for 20 years to become managers.

There are a few very high quality experts in the USGS, but most are average. Those are usually highly published and recognized.  The managers are mediocre (those that can't science, manage)

The current manager at my last office was extremely Christian... Oxymoron much? 

...

And there's NO avenue to move up from technician to hydrologist.  They act like you need to be so smart to work in the studies, and the skills your learn as a technician don't apply whatsoever to bring a hydrologist. Positions are so rare and they hand pick for the position.

Fuck it, I left and got a Geologist job with Corps of Engineers.

 ..

Edit: forgot to mention how horribly unfulfilling the work is... It's like 50% data review, filling in worksheet stating what you did in the field, on top of the field notes you already wrote.. they don't trust you to do shit

I am visiting Charlotte for the first time this weekend--I love black coffee (and Americano), and plan to visit Enderly Coffee Co., Night\* Swim, and HEX. Since there are multiple locations for Night Swim...which one do you recommend for a visitor? I am sure all locations have their own characters, but was just wondering what you (those who live in Charlotte, or anyone who has visited before) like the best. If this helps, I usually like to look around different neighborhoods, go to local events, and...just [zone out](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/zoning-out-is-good-for-you.html) imagining I am one of the locals üòÇ (My partner and I are in our mid 30s if you think this matters).

Also a dumb question (please laugh, it's OK): I come from a warmer place...and sometimes I realize that indoors can get pretty hot when I visit cities where winters are colder than where I am from. How's the temperature gap between indoor and outdoor? Trying to figure out how to dress for the weather that is very different from where I live. I know this sounds so dumb, but I have to ask because I had an experience where wearing a thick sweater was a terrible idea in another place I visited when winter was freezing. It was like 90F inside and 25 outside. I know Charlotte has a way warmer weather than that but still wanted to ask.

Thank you!

1i1n6kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1i1n6kn/turning_failed_amazon_returns_into_5kmo/,Turning Failed Amazon Returns into $5k/mo,"Ever scrolled through your order history and realized you never returned that weird kitchen gadget you swore you‚Äôd send back? You‚Äôre not alone. Millions of people sit on Amazon returns past the refund window, crossing their fingers it‚Äôll magically handle itself. That‚Äôs where you come in with a brand-new side hustle.

The beauty of this hustle? Your customers give you their unwanted stuff for free. When you sell it, you keep 20-30% of the profits and send them the rest. They win by getting money they‚Äôd otherwise kiss goodbye, and you win by flipping their lost returns into sweet side-hustle income. Let‚Äôs talk about turning this little operation into a $5k/month moneymaker.

**The MVP (Getting your first customer)**

Find Your First Batch of Items:

* Start with your own stuff lying around the house. Get used to selling stuff online (if you haven‚Äôt already).

Sell friends and family items:

* Post on your personal social media explaining how you‚Äôll take their ‚Äúforgot-to-return Amazon purchases,‚Äù sell them, and split the profits.
* They hand over random items for free‚Äîeverything from clothing to electronics‚Äîbecause they‚Äôre already out the money.
* You‚Äôll handle listing, shipping, and dealing with buyers.

Establish Your Profit Split:

* Charge 20-30% of the sale price for your service. Keep it simple and transparent: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take your item, list it for you, and you get 70-80% of whatever it sells for.‚Äù

List Items on Multiple Platforms

* eBay, OfferUp, Facebook Marketplace, Mercari, Poshmark: Cast a wide net.
* Make sure to shoot decent photos and write clear, honest descriptions.

**Numbers Breakdown (First Batch)**

Suppose you pick up 5 items worth about $50 each in resale value.

You sell them for $250 total.

You keep 25% = $62.50.

Your friend/family member gets $187.50 for what was basically junk in their closet.

Now you‚Äôve got cash in hand, social proof, and you‚Äôre off to the races.

**Getting Your Next 100 Customers**

Ready to go bigger? The good news is people everywhere have random Amazon items collecting dust. Let‚Äôs tap into that gold mine.

1. Social Media Blitz:
   * Create a Facebook Business Page or Instagram account called something like ‚ÄúAmazon Return Rescue‚Äù or ‚ÄúForgot-to-Return.‚Äù
   * Post photos of items you‚Äôve sold, before-and-after stories, and testimonials from happy folks who got money back.
   * Encourage shares, likes, and comments to reach more potential customers.
2. Referral Program
   * Offer your existing clients (friends, family, early customers) a 10% bonus on their next item if they refer someone who has at least one item to sell.
   * Word-of-mouth is powerful here‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs got that buddy who forgot to return a cat hammock or electronic doodad.
3. Local Ads & Community Boards
   * Put up flyers at community centers, coffee shops, or anywhere with a bulletin board.
   * Pitch it as a hassle-free way to make money back on items that are otherwise collecting dust.
   * Emphasize your ‚Äúno risk‚Äù model: If it doesn‚Äôt sell, they haven‚Äôt lost anything (they were going to toss or donate it anyway).
4. Small Business Collabs
   * Some local businesses end up with overstock, returns, or open-box items from Amazon vendor programs. Offer to handle their liquidation for a cut.
   * They free up space and time, you earn a steady supply of resellable goods.

**Numbers Breakdown (Next 100 Customers)**

* Now you‚Äôre handling about 25 items per week, average resale value of $40. That‚Äôs $1,000 gross weekly.
* At 25% commission, you pocket $250 a week = $1,000 a month.
* As your reach grows, so will the volume. The more items you flip, the bigger that pot gets.

**Building to $5,000 Per Month in Profit**

Let‚Äôs ramp this up to a legit operation that nets you $5k in profit monthly. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Hire or Partner Up**
   1. Sorting, photographing, listing, shipping‚Äîit all takes time. Once you‚Äôre handling 50+ items a week, consider bringing on a part-time helper or partner.
2. **Streamline Your Listing Process**
   1. Use inventory management tools like Vendoo, List Perfectly, or eBay‚Äôs bulk listing feature to post items across multiple platforms at once.
3. Niche Down
   1. Certain categories move faster and fetch better prices‚Äîelectronics, brand-new apparel, baby gear, small kitchen appliances, etc.
   2. If you see a trend (e.g., people forgetting to return cookware or smart home devices), become the go-to reseller for that niche.
4. Offer Premium Services
   1. Expand to a house-call service: You‚Äôll come pick up their items, take them away, and handle everything. Charge an extra fee or slightly higher commission for that convenience.
5. Bulk Deals with Repeat Clients
   1. Partner with local real estate agents or apartment complexes. When people move, they often purge items they never returned.
   2. Offer them a special rate if they send multiple items your way, or a flat commission for a large lot.

**Big Picture Math:**

1. 50 items per week at $40 average resale = $2,000 gross each week.
2. At a 25% take, that‚Äôs $500 a week = $2,000/month.
3. Scale to 100 items weekly = $4,000/month. Add premium services or higher-value items, and you‚Äôre knocking on that $5k door.
