1kuhxe9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kuhxe9/how_do_i_move_on_and_see_myself_with_someone_new/,How do I move on and see myself with someone new after destroying my own future?,"For starters: I don't blame her at all. This situation is my own doing, and the consequences of my own actions. I also know how stupid I was in almost every decision I made in hindsight. I'm just looking to get this off my chest and try and accept the decision.

In November 2024 I ended a 6 year relationship. I had been confused for a long time and had been struggling with mental health. She was understandably upset and wanted me back, but I knew I wasn't in the right place to commit to her as she deserved.

In February 2025, contact naturally started again after she posted a love letter through my door. I knew immediately that I wanted her back, but had given myself 6 month minimum so I could mentally improve, but rather stupidly I didn't tell her that.

Contact continued regularly, as it went on it was getting to a point of messaging almost daily, but wasn't anything deep. At the end of April or start of May, she made another attempt to meet up, suggesting we get a coffee together. I didn't agree or disagree as the conversation moved on, but wanted to, however, I again thought that I was only 3 weeks away from 6 months and should stick it.

Contact continued under Sunday 18th May, exactly 6 months after the breakup. I called her and told her how I felt and that I had improved and could commit now my mental health was better. She told me that she needed time to think. After 5 long, anxiety inducing days and 2 love letters that I wrote her, on Friday 23rd May she told me that after I didn't accept coffee with her, she accepted the fact that I wasn't coming back and decided to move on. She said that although it had only been 3 weeks, it was almost as if the entire 6 months of moving on hit her all at once. With that, she didn't see the future anymore, didn't feel the connection anymore and told me no. I could see in her face that she was emotionless to me, and that it was truly over.

We have now cut all contact and I am distraught. I am so angry at myself for so many reasons. I didn't truly know what I had until I left, I thought of 6 months as some golden rule rather than following my heart, and I should've just said yes to Coffee. I would've said yes to Coffee if I knew it was my last chance.

I know all the cliches of 'there's plenty more fish in the sea' and that 'it'll get easier with time', but at the moment I honestly feel that I've thrown away my entire life. I've thrown away the amazing future I've been dreaming of for 6 years, even during the 6 months apart as I thought we'd get back together once we had grown.

I am someone who struggles very much with connection due to my neurodiversity. In the 27 years I've been alive, she is the deepest connection I have ever had, she is the only person I have tolerated for such a prolonged time, she is the only person I have not been able to easily discard from my life like I have friends, and she is the only person I felt I could truly be myself around without judgement, no matter how weird I was. We got on so effortless and felt like we were meant to be so quickly after we started dating.

I have to accept I have made the biggest mistake of my life, and move on from it, but right now I cannot see myself making that same connection with anybody else ever, and don't want to. I am crying every hour, even whilst writing this, and don't see hope.",1,1748110070.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Suffice to say, I haven't slept more than 2 hours in a night in at least 2 months. I breastfeed so I do all the wakeups and care for our baby overnight. 

I was recommended a sleep training book by a lactation specialist, I bought it and read the chapter appropriate for our child right away. The book said not to do it when our baby was sick and he had a stuffy nose, so I told my husband about two weeks ago we should probably wait a bit to do it. Last week, I asked when he wanted to start, and he said this weekend and I asked if that meant Friday night. He said yes. 

I told him I thought he should read the chapter too so we were on the same page. I marked the chapter with Post-its and told him I did and left it on his desk.

I asked him Thursday night if he still wanted to start sleep training on Friday. He said yes. I asked if he wanted to wait until he had a chance to read the book and he said no, he'd follow my lead. 

A friend who used the same method told me the other day that their pediatrician told them the dad should be the one doing the sleep training because baby can resist or it not go well if mom does it. I told my husband this yesterday evening, and he immediately went quiet and didn't say much. I asked what was wrong, and he said he didn't know he would be taking the lead on this and wasn't prepared. 

I said I wasn't saying he had to do all of it, I was communicating that according to another friend and pediatrician we may need to be prepared that if it's not going well he may need to do more of it so that we can get through it, but that I didn't mean he had to do all of it. I was trying to warn him. 

He still was solemn and started making coffee in preparation. I said we didn't have to start last night, so we waited. But I'm unsure if I'm overreacting for being frustrated about this. I feel like I did my best to prep us both and check that he was ready. AIO?",3,1748109738.0,AIO,11,0.8,False

- Professional environment outside the coffee shop/home office routine

That medication is Zavzpret, a nasal spray. I'm terribly relieved that I finally have a way to sort of prevent the migraines and keep going about my day, but the aftertaste in the back of my throat with the nasal spray is beginning to be a real problem. It's honestly the absolute worst thing I have ever tasted in my damn life, and no matter what I do it lingers for hours and hours. It burns the back of my throat too. Milk, hot coffee, hot tea, carbonated soda, spicy things, sour things, I've tried it all, but the taste is just too overpowering and is present no matter what. The only thing that sort of gets it to go away is if I toss a pinch of straight paprika in the back of my throat. It's so bad to the point that I have a small jar of paprika at my desk. It still only barely works and the taste is all I can think about for the next 6 hours.

I have sensory processing disorder, I think maybe it has something to do with that or mild ADHD since my doctor seems to think it's not a common problem and offered no solution that has worked so far. If ANYONE has experienced anything similar to this, I am desperate for remedies. We migraine people are very creative with our ways to deal with migraines, I'm hoping someone has discovered some magic juice or something that makes it go away, or maybe a different way to take the spray? I swear I wouldn't be posting about this if I wasn't seriously bothered by it.

I have no friends, stuck at an annoying sucky ass job just because it pays well enough, he still works part time but has been slowly building up to working 30 hours a week so at least he is contributing more now. Since I feel like I‚Äôm too old now to go back and do anything I originally wanted to do with my life I started looking into other careers I‚Äôve been interested in and real estate has always been a big one for me too. So I decided I would start taking a course in order to get licensed and start a real career. Well that‚Äôs when shit started to get worse and worse. Now I already did literally all the cleaning while working 55+ hours a week, did all the laundry, dishes, picking up messes he left since he doesn‚Äôt clean after himself. I do it because if I didn‚Äôt it never gets done. If it was up to him all the dishes would be dirty on the coffee table and him surrounded by trash and dirty clothes and whatever other shit that‚Äôs just clutter around, if he needs a drink he‚Äôd take a dirty cup and barely rinse it then drink out of it. Everything would just pile
Up if I don‚Äôt do it. Anyways when I started this course I was still working full time and doing everything and he was on board with me trying to get into this since ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be making so much money I will be a stay at home boyfriend‚Äù. I‚Äôm already pretty checked out but I‚Äôve been best friends with his sister forever and I made a stupid promise to never break up and I‚Äôm someone who believes in trying to make it work unless he beats me or
Something (another bad take I know). So I decided I‚Äôd go part time so I can focus on the course more and get it done quicker but that just made him start resenting me i feel. Now he‚Äôs working 38 hours a week and complains to me how he does all the working and providing and I need to do more cleaning and make sure the house is completely clean all the time I have to cook all meal‚Äôs still and laundry and everything, if something isn‚Äôt done I get yelled at because how I‚Äôm only
Part time I have no excuses now like working to not have done this work. And he throws breakup around all the time. He basically treated to break up this morning but refused to talk about why, said he‚Äôd talk after he gets back from work so it doesn‚Äôt ruin his whole day, I asked if he just wanted to break up and he said idk maybe, I can‚Äôt tell you what I don‚Äôt know. I want to just start packing his shit but I also don‚Äôt want to be the one who kicked him out. I have no friends to talk to it‚Äôs literally only him and his family. Me and his sister aren‚Äôt really close anymore but I still love her and his family but people would obviously pick the side of their own family
Than mine, and I‚Äôm not one to talk about relationship issues so this is a first for me and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs all jumbled I‚Äôm just typing whatever comes to mind and I‚Äôm sorry.",1,1748109098.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.99,False

1kuhcla,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kuhcla/wife_42f_emotionally_cheated_on_me_43m_and_wants/,Wife 42F emotionally cheated on me 43M and wants to stay friends with him.,"For a while I 43M was on antidepressants and my dose was too high, I became very focused on work and it numbed my emotions and my relationship with my wife 42F of 12 years suffered without myself realizing it. We have a child and he's friends with another couples' kid. We'd spend time with that family and my wife got to know both of them well, but I was more on the acquaintance level with them, but the husband and I had a lot of shared interests and would chat together a lot when we were together, but wasn't someone I seeked out or continued the friendship with outside of get togethers or running into each other at the park or school pickups. We've known them for about 5 years.

About 9 months ago my wife was volunteering with both the husband and wife and others and asked me one day if it would be ok to get coffee with the husband, since they wanted to talk about the volunteer stuff outside of the volunteer environment. I said it was ok, I knew their family and it seemed everything was fine, and she did, and she did a few more times. I started noticing they were texting a lot and it turns out they were both sharing their dissatisfactions with their marriages and how to work things out with their spouses. That they needed someone to talk to and wanted to make things better and be respectful of their spouses. And then for about a month or so their messaging became inappropriate, but my wife says they cut that out on their own out of respect for their spouses and that they weren't sending pics or doing anything physical. She said she wasn't attracted to him even though he said he was attracted to her for a few years. He was someone she formed an emotional bond with through hearing each other's experiences. I believe her. 

I found out about it all when I decided to taper myself off the medication. My psychiatrist said it would be the next step anyway, and things weren't feeling right in my relationship. Around that time, after my wife came back from the cafe where she was meeting with him, she was telling me some things while I was working and I was just nodding and saying ""uh huh"". She confronted me about what's happening in our relationship, and what are we at this point? We hardly talk anymore or show each other affection. She was crying. She was right, but I brushed it off. But being off of medication, that night, it was starting to grate on me when before it would slide off me, everything she said, I knew it was true. I was crying to myself for the first time in years. I was feeling things again that the meds were blocking and I was really sorry. 

The next day I told her about getting off the medication and feeling things more and being sorry, wanting to fix things and how much I love her. She was very receptive and happy and wanted to fix things too. Things felt so good. The next day she got dropped home by him from volunteering, and I started remembering how much they were texting, and how my kid said he's her ""boyfriend"" on a couple occasions. I told her that's been bothering me. And I said when our kid says the boyfriend stuff, I know how he can say A LOT of silly things, but I trust my wife but just wanted to let her know it's been bothering me. 

That's when she filled me in about the above, the emotional affair they ended on their own, etc. The boyfriend stuff because our kid would always see them texting. She thought I didn't care about her anymore. She thought my distance meant I might leave. She was beginning to do things like look for jobs in case I leave, since I seemed checked out. She told me everything straight away, and I believe her. I feel so sad putting her in the situation where she wouldn't feel secure. I always loved her and would do anything for us, but I can see how numb and dulled and distant I was. She's not wrong for thinking any of that based on what she was seeing.

I can 100% see why she thought that, because looking back I didn't recognize myself through that period of time. There were times where I let her leave the house crying after a disagreement and didn't try to comfort her or fix things. That was a key moment for her realizing I wasn't the same man she married. 

Both her and him had relationship trouble and were trying to work through it and have someone to talk to. And that they wanted to be respectful to their spouses. But somewhere along the lines, like how it seems a lot of emotional affairs start, they started giving each other more attention, replacing the attention that was gone from their partners. They promised no matter what happened they'll always be close friends. I accepted it all and wanted to move on. He messaged me assuring nothing happened between them and they were only talking and needed someone to lend an ear to, he considers me a friend and wanted to clear the air. And that he won't be telling his spouse because how bad things are with them currently.

She was still texting him frequently as a friend after, but it seemed too much. I would have preferred they didn't talk privately at all anymore, but felt so guilty from my medication days that I didn't want to do that to her. I told her I'd prefer it if they didn't talk about relationship stuff and set boundaries of what we talk about as a couple and what they talk about as friends. She agreed. But weeks went by and I was still bothered, I wanted them to talk less and she agreed. After weeks of that I could tell she may have been talking to him less but she was talking to him multiple times a day everyday and it definitely seemed like more than she texts anyone else she knows, and more than anyone I text. I told her how uncomfortable all this makes me and I'm essentially just letting this stuff happen because I feel so guilty. She agreed and I can tell they don't talk very often now and she's also not arranging trips to the park with the kids with them and stuff. I can see all that. She sees him for essential stuff only like volunteering and texts much less and she says it's just stuff about volunteering or sending a meme or small things. But I know it's much less than before, and I feel like if she cut back to this level when everything was revealed I would have been on a better path to recovering. But instead it happened about 3 months after I found out so I have months of insecurity built into this.

She tells me she wants to go back to how things were before everything happened, but knows she ruined it. For us families to be friends and have someone in the neighborhood we're close with and can trust, because we were alone when we came here. When she greatly tapered back the texting it was after I asked if she would resent me if I told her to stop talking to him, and she said she would, because she now has a close friend and I'm taking that away. That it's a friendship like she hasn't had after so many years without someone to talk to and if I was to take that away she would feel some resentment to me. But she said our relationship comes first of course, and if I needed that, she would do it. She also mentions things about how she keeps talking to him because he's a friend and she's worried about him getting depressed, etc in his situation. 

I feel upset because he doesn't seem to be interested in fixing his own issues with his wife or moving on, just gets to feel good talking to my wife, even though them interacting only brings up bad memories to me. I feel like she doesn't see what any of this is doing to me and how hard it is everyday thinking about it. I trust her that this is how she's feeling and I see her cutting things lower and that she feels ok about it. But we've been to a couple things at their place together, and I see him every now and then in common areas in the community, and I hate it. I make smalltalk with him like we used to to keep up appearances but I'd rather be anywhere else. His wife doesn't know about it but I do, so I hate being around her. When my wife is on her phone I get nervous she's texting him sometimes. Even though I agreed to less contact, I hate her talking to him. When her mood changes a little bit I'm worried it's because she's becoming less interested in me. I read into everything more than I should. It feels like a wound is being kept open and that his feelings mean more than my own. They promised to be friends no matter what happens, but what about the promises we made when we got married? Is it really ok to resent me when we came first and she broke that? I know she wants to keep this friendship between us all, she says she wants me and him to be friends again too. But I want nothing to do with anyone from that family. 

I feel like if I get my closure of no contact, that I'll also lose my wife from her resentment too. In which case is the relationship even worth saving? I couldn't imagine forcing her to do this. I don't understand. But I understand my years of being on the wrong medication dosage and how lonely it must have made her feel. How she might not believe I'm going to stay ""back"", and what it's like having a friend to talk to that was there when no one else was.

I know if he wasn't in the picture I wouldn't feel as insecure about our relationship as I do, as the less she talks to him the better I feel. Because this ordeal has made me feel worse than anything in my life and I don't think she has any idea of how it feels because she's upset that the emotional affair was just a month of inappropriate texts which is a small blip in a years long friendship with him and his family. But I'm forever changed, after a decade with her and all the trust I had in her. I've never been hurt this hard before.

I believe her, I don't imagine her getting inappropriate with him again, and I see her messaging less, we talk about when I'm not feeling good about things, and she tells me she wants me to just ask her what she's talking about with him if I need to instead of stewing about it. Our relationship seems pretty much normal like it used to before my meds, but I get triggered to the point of her seeing the worry on my face almost every week, and we talk about it. Sometimes I don't know what to say to her in a conversation because I'll just start thinking of the affair. I see her going about her life like normal, and wonder if she knows I'm just sitting here struggling, I can't think of anything else sometimes. I trust her, but it's like I see the same elements together and scared that a similar scenario will happen with those elements combined. We make an effort to be communicative now and we're much more open. She says if we run into another problem, we're able to talk about it now vs before when we would avoid conflict or sometimes argue and shut down and wait hours to finally make up. We don't do that stuff anymore and it feels good being able to talk openly.

I feel so ready to move on from the hurt and get on with our lives together, but everyday I feel haunted by them still talking, it makes me relive finding out about things everyday when she brings him up innocently when talking about volunteering or  something. I think about it everyday, and some days I get really depressed about it, like if she's having a bad day I may think she's not into me anymore and it'll feel like my world is crumbling. I don't want my wife to resent me for taking away a friend she really trusts. The same person I would rather not see or hear from for the rest of my life.

I don't know what to do, I love her more than anything and I know she's trying. She says if it was someone she just met or someone where our families weren't linked for so many years she'd cut then out completely. I see her picking up her old hobbies again vs talking to him all the time, I know she's changing, but I'm scared it'll never be enough for me, that I'll want no contact outside of stuff with the kids or something, and she'll resent me. 

I don't have anyone else to talk to about this stuff so I just wanted somewhere to vent and see if anyone else has been in a similar situation and what they would suggest. She doesn't seem super keen to do couples therapy, but says she would if I feel it's necessary. I feel like she's not eager to do it because it seems like the usual advice is to remove the affair partner completely. She's also on medication and I'm wondering if it's clouding her perception of everything and seeing it through a less emotionally intense perspective.",0,1748108564.0,relationship_advice,10,0.5,False

Explaining a concept like manifestation to a child is like trying to teach your cat algebra‚Äîhighly unlikely to end well.

Parents want their kids to *believe* in themselves and also figure out how to *make things happen*. But the gap between intention and action? It‚Äôs wide.

Cue the internal monologue: ‚ÄúAm I doing enough to guide them?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre we just winging it here?‚Äù

Sound familiar?

If you've ever wondered how to help your child dream big without serving them a side of confusion, you're not alone.

[Go for Your Goals](https://theworldhealth.org/4life-happy-kids-official) offers something helpful: a way to show children how their thoughts connect with what they do‚Äîall in a format that‚Äôs fun, engaging, and doesn‚Äôt come with glittery nonsense or vague pep talks.

# üì¶ Product Overview

**Product Name:** Go for Your Goals

Nine videos are also included, exploring topics like **how to teach kids self-belief**, build focus, and make big goals feel small enough to act on.

Don‚Äôt skip the 10 printable activities. They include the Rainforest Board Game and the Mind Maze Challenge, which are great **tools to help kids stay motivated and focused** without boredom setting in.

If you're looking for **interactive goal-setting tools for young learners**, the activities hit that sweet spot between learning and play.

# üß† How It Actually Works

This isn‚Äôt a plug-and-play app. You‚Äôll be involved. And that‚Äôs a good thing. Parents are instrumental in turning those **visualization techniques for young kids** into [real habits](https://theworldhealth.org/4life-happy-kids-official).

The system supports both **fun goal-setting activities for kids and parents** and moments where you're sitting together and talking about their dreams.

You won't need to overthink the language. The scripts in the Parent‚Äôs Guide make it easy **to explain visualization to a child** without turning it into a TED Talk.

Age-based customization means younger kids and older ones aren‚Äôt lumped into the same learning track. That keeps **goal-setting ideas for elementary students** sharp and specific.

# üå± What Kids Learn

This program supports character-building through play, stories, and open discussion. It‚Äôs especially helpful for kids who need a little boost in the confidence department.

You'll explore **positive affirmations for kids to achieve their goals** in the form of repeating short statements, writing them down, or including them in games.

The stories are simple but relatable. We really liked the fact that the **manifestation stories were written for children** without drifting into fantasy land.

The lessons in **beginner-friendly manifestation for children** engage participants through activities that focus on taking action‚Äînot just thinking positive thoughts and hoping for unicorns.

It‚Äôs a sweet spot between mindset and action, without sounding preachy or academic.

And if your child is learning from home, you'll find this is one of the better **homeschool resources for teaching the law of attraction**.

# üë©‚Äçüé® Simone‚Äôs Real-World Experience ...

My friend **Simone**, a former art therapist who now runs creative mindset workshops for kids in the community center near my place, tried [Go for Your Goals](https://theworldhealth.org/4life-happy-kids-official) after I mentioned it during one of our coffee catch-ups.

She‚Äôs got a real talent for helping anxious or shy kids express themselves through storytelling and drawing, so I figured she‚Äôd be the perfect person to give this a go with her Monday afternoon group.

She printed the worksheets and brought the younger kids‚Äô eBook into one of her ‚Äúvision board‚Äù classes.

Instead of her usual drawing prompts, she used the jungle-themed story as a launchpad. One kid, usually silent and withdrawn, perked up and said he wanted to ‚Äúbe a bird so I can be brave and fast.‚Äù

Simone told me it was the most he'd ever spoken in front of the group. That moment alone sold her on the value of this content.

They also tried the Rainforest Board Game together. She said the kids were obsessed‚Äîhalf the group didn‚Äôt want to stop playing, even after snack time.

They didn‚Äôt even realize they were discussing their goals out loud. It was subliminal learning at its best.

Her only complaint? The visuals in the videos didn‚Äôt hold the older kids‚Äô attention as well‚Äîsome of them drifted off when it wasn‚Äôt interactive.

But for the younger ones, it worked like a charm. Simone's verdict: it blended right into her program like it belonged there all along.

And knowing her standards? That‚Äôs saying something.

1kuhaft,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1kuhaft/how_i_feel_about_the_companions_after_finishing/,How I feel about the companions after finishing DATV (Major Spoilers),"Note: All this is my opinion based on my blind playthrough. DATV isn't perfect but overall my time with it was alright (7/10). Do not read further if you haven't finished the game and are planning to.>!(Started as an female elven Warden, Saved Minranthous, Got everyone to veilguard status, Davrin lead the distraction, Neve dismantled wards, Mythal ending)!<

**Harding:** Nice to see her again. I wish the game played a bit more onto >!dwarves doing magic again since that's going to cause uproar in Orzammar!<. Seems like no one really cares outside of Harding's quests? I ended up not choosing her in the final mission to lead the assault because if there will be a sequel, I want to see what she does with her magic (maybe something with Dagna?)

**Neve:** Right off the bat I knew I was going for her romance route. I'm a sucker for 40s/50s noir films and her character sounds right up my alley. I found her a bit boring at first but her conflict with Aelia shows her true personality. I love that she's an idealist forced to be cynical but still tries to do the right thing. Always wondering if there was a point helping Dock Town if all it does is stab her in the back. Chef's kiss for me. To be fair, I understand why people don't like her (voice acting flat, boring writing) but it feels proper that getting to know her is a slow burn because of how burnt out she is from botched jobs/losing people close to her. Not going to lie, I was anxious >!after she got blighted in the end mission. I definitely got attached to her and the thought of her not being able to call my Rook ""Trouble"" again made me a bit sad.!<

**Lucanis:** Tbh I was most disappointed in his character writing and the Crows in general, I feel bad for lucanismancers. I was expecting Spite to play a bigger role/Lucanis to pull an Anders move. Instead the worst Spite does is make him sleepwalk? I also think the Spite wings look very early 2000s emo MySpace edit on Lucanis but whatever. There was 0 danger when it came to dealing with Spite and no satisfying resolution to this plot point. Just a small popup that said ""Lucanis wants to get rid of spite after the game is over"". Like, okay...that's it?? Maybe it's different if I saved Treviso instead or romanced him but I unfortunately don't find him compelling enough to care. I didn't mind him talking about coffee/cooking so much but I can see why some people would find it annoying. Especially when the Crows were softened up so much (like seriously, the worst this group of mafia assassins does to Illario is jailing him??)

**Emmerich:** The best character, full stop. If I didn't romance Neve, I would've gone for him. I love how they subverted tropes with him as the party's necromancer but didn't make him your typical scary/edgy undead summoner. His personal quests were a satisfying story & was the highlight of the Mournwatch faction. I ended up making him a lich because I thought he'd make an excellent leader/advisor to said faction. >!(Maybe he can always chat with Manfred with his lich powers?)!<

**Davrin:** My bro in arms, I liked his character too. Seeing him grow from not giving a care about his life to being a parental figure for Assan/finding a purpose in life was cool. >!However, I didn't know choosing him to lead the distraction team meant he'd die. I chose solely based on the fact that Davrin's a fighter and the goal of the mission was to create a distraction that would last. Harding on the other hand is first and foremost a scout so Davrin made the most sense to me. RIP!<

**Taash:** Oh boy lol. I'm going to be honest and say I didn't find her annoying as most people would. Yes, she's written as a hot headed young adult with inner turmoil about her intersectional culture(s)/gender identity. I come from a similar background so I can get why she lashes out at her mom and gives out angsty teen vibes. On the other hand, I didn't like how Taash would rage at other people not related to her issues (Neve) like ,wtf? You just met these people and you're already taking your anger out at them? >!Also the push up scene was horrendous to the point where I had to pause the game. You're telling me doing push up to apologize or misgendering someone is better than just a flat out genuine ""sorry""? Like doing push ups isn't making it more about yourself instead of apologizing, what???!<

**Bellara:** I thought I was going to find her annoying but she grew on me. The moments where she becomes less upbeat reigned me in on her character. Showing her true emotions and her conflict with Cyrian/living for herself was a nice personal quest. However, I didn't like how she was apologetic for how the elven gods messed things up. It was giving me big white guilt vibes. As a veil jumper who studies these entities, she should know that it was her people's legacy but not her fault that the god decided to be assholes one day.

1kuha1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1kuha1v/tifu_overdosed_on_caffeine_and_had_a_near_death/,TIFU Overdosed on caffeine and had a near death experience,"It actually happened yesterday and the aftershock is still crawling through my body so I guess writing might help cope with it + be a good lesson to others.

On Thursday night I had a friend come over for a couple of drinks so we drank around 4-5 glasses of wine and went to sleep.

Yesterday I woke up feeling fine, but had a mild dull headache so I looked for Ibuprofen, but I ran out of it so I had breakfast and then took a painkiller that contains codeine and caffeine. I stopped taking these years ago because I became immune to them, but they were the only painkillers I had so I went with it.Drank my morning coffee as usual and felt perfectly fine.

I had some errands to run in town (had an appointment for a bank loan that I signed up for) and after that I went for coffee with a friend. Everything was completely fine until I drank the most disgusting, foul tasting coffee I've ever had in my life. As we were sitting and chatting my stomach began feeling like a hard lump filled with gas and I felt a dull pain in my left rib area, but apart from that I was okay. Twenty minutes later, the lights of the shopping mall we were at (I absolutely hate shopping malls because the lights usually make me feel dizzy) began glitching (in my mind) and I felt like my head was going to fall off my neck, so I told this friend that I must go home, went to the supermarket and bought a 1l bottle of water with enhanced rehydrating formula, drank half of it by the time I got to the cash register. I thought I felt a bit better, but as soon as it was my turn to pay, I felt like my body wasn't moving, although it was, as if my brain couldn't process my body movement on a conscious level.After I paid I walked out and kept drinking the water in small sips. 



Outside, the rain was pouring, but I felt like I had to move because if I stayed in one place I would faint. By this point my leg, arm, neck and back muscles began twitching. I speed walked in circles around the main town square, without umbrella, cold rain pouring over me, and I felt nothing. I tried staring at my feet because looking around, people moving and walking past me made me feel even worse and more dizzy. After five circles around the square, I went to the bus station and waited for bus to go home. My heart was pounding like crazy and my whole body was in a spasm that I've only felt once in my life, when I accidentally OD'd on caffeine eight years ago. I was finally coming to terms with the fact that taking that much caffeine in two hours is the cause of all of this and it sent me into panic mode. I'm naturally quite paranoid, so being in the state of hyper alertness was probably the worst thing that could happen, but it did, so I tried to soothe myself and calm down by taking deep breaths. I was able to detach for a couple of seconds, but my twitching muscles and brain glitch wouldn't leave me alone. My mouth felt dry and my jaw was also in spasm, so I began panicking even more, as I was convinced that I was about to have brain seizure and my career (I work as a translator) would end, since I know someone who had a brain seizure and was no longer able to speak their second language. So I began reminiscing everything in my life, all my successes and downfalls and sending my second and third languages to the grave. I was pretty sure that either I will die or that I will have a seizure with terrible consequences for my future. 



Once I left the bus I speed walked home, and as I was approaching my house, my brain began playing games, as if it was forgetting how to walk, although I was walking the entire time, my brain couldn't process it at all. I got home and ran straight to the bathroom, splashed my face with some cold water and went to bed. I could only lay on my back, as laying on the side like I usually do made me feel nauseous. I couldn't sleep, nor could I close my eyes, because if I did I felt like there were thousands of fireflies flying inside my head and like I was about to fall into a deep dark pit and never wake up again. Once I stopped feeling dizzy (after about two hours of staring at the ceiling and taking deep breaths), I went downstairs, took a shower and got myself comfortable on the couch. I watched some documentaries in my second and third language just to keep my brain engaged and assure myself that I haven't magically forgotten them. 



Finally, I was feeling more down to earth, but still a bit foggy, and my neck and back were still in a severe spasm. I felt like there was a rock piercing through my back and moving up to my neck. I didn't have a blood pressure monitor at home because my partner (who occasionally has high blood pressure) took it with her (she was returning from her work trip yesterday), so I proceeded to press my upper wrist against the wall for a minute and once I took it off my arm went up well to my ear level, which supposedly means high blood pressure (honestly, I've tried this many, many times just out of curiosity, and it never went up this high). When my partner finally got back home (around 21:00 h), she gave me a half of a 3 mg diazepam pill and some twenty minutes later I finally felt my back again, the strange rock-hard animal that was living inside it for the majority of the day disappeared and I could finally rest without panicking. 



This morning I woke up happy that I am still alive, but in quite a lot of muscle pain from whatever are the insane acrobatics my body was doing yesterday. I still speak all the languages I spoke before and I'm more or less okay, but still traumatized. As expected, I didn't have a sip of coffee today, and I'm not sure how long will I abstain from coffee and caffeine altogether, but I will certainly never ever ever do this to myself again.

  
TL;DR: Took a pill with caffeine and codeine in it, then drank two cups of coffee and ended up with one day long muscle spasms, dizziness and paranoia. ",0,1748108379.0,tifu,22,0.21,False
1kuh9xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1kuh9xv/wanderlust_part_3/,Wanderlust Part 3,"24th May, day six or seven 

Still in Ghent, maybe the fourth day in the city. Very fatigued by recent events, after daring to smoke some of marijuana that I imported into Belgium, later that night after other people were hassling me to leave the concert (not staff of the place,  some student spoke poking my chest) and a few more drinks in another bar, two policemen walked up to me as I was walking and asked what I was doing. 

Said I was walking down the street. After several more minutes of annoying questions and statements, they grabbed one arm each and led me into the back of their car.

After getting me into the building they took my shoes and backpack and left me on a plastic mattress.

Still stoned I did the popular thing after cursing silently and laid down. Woke up when I was shouted and hazily stood up and walked out after the guy outside the door through my trainers and backpack at me.

Still no idea why I was arrested, I tested a theory and searched my backpack.

My ounce of cannabis had been taken. It was cleverly hidden and I doubt that some duty cop would have found it by casual search. And after being in the country for days it was only after I removed some from my bag and smkkke8it that afternoon, that I had it stolen from me, I believe due to some other member of the public disliking my choice of plant.

Mugged for the umpteenth time. They didn't steal my passport or wallet though, or near broken laptop.

It really is a sad event(s).

I walked down the street away from the station, and my thirst was great once more, as was my hunger after not eating for twenty odd hours and not drinking for 8 or more.

I walked into the cafe, dying of thirst. I was so desperate that I bought a coffee and three 7  euro fruit waters and a chocolate slice (6.90) for my stomach. 

Even after drinking the water I was uncommonly light headed, hands shaking (and I don't get delirium tremens, except from the bottle with the label on it, which I remember now having drank a few on other nights) and felt the beginnings of cold sweats.

 The waitress walked over to me and asked me if I was alright. I said something and after a few more minutes she came back to my table and asked me again, so guess I didn't look too amazing (unlike one usually does) and she said she had called an ambulance.

 I mumbled assent and felt my sweat on my skin until paramedics arrived and also, with the same amount of strength available to them as the police earlier, took an arm each and sat me down then strapped me into the ambulance.

 They set off driving, asking me the usuals. When we got to to the hospital they took me to an empty ward with no lights on and undressed me, changing me into a rather fabulously freeing nightie, and wheeled in a machine with a large plastic duct attached.

 Two nurses then piled me in the biggest blankets ever and lobbed the ventilation duct under the blankets. They turned the machines settings to 38 degrees and switched it on. I had no idea how cold I was until that point.

 I grabbed the duct and wafted it around, under and over my body the heat unnoticeable compared to the parts of my body that were urgent suggesting the use of the ventilation duct machine.

I slept once more on a plastic mattress while the machine did it's work. I was awoken by another nurse who asked me for my address. When I mentioned I don't have an address in Belgium, she said that she had to have my British one, to send the bill for the treatment.

Even in that diseased stare I recognised a fake address was needed, so wrote down what looked similar to letters and numbers and signed it then she walked away with her contract.

She woke me again later, saying she couldn't read my writing, and so I wrote a more polite random assorted choice of house number, street name, city (Middlesbrough this time) and country (England, of course).

She left again and as.my body had started to send weak little French flavour messages of ""Je suis too calor!"" I decided to get out of hospital, took the bandage off my arm (oh yeah, they took a blood sample, just remembered now also that the doctor said my blood sugar levels were fine (150) when she asked questions.

 I asked if the cold sweats and near-fainting condition was caused by diabetes, as I don't usually feel like that after smoking and drinking, so I still should find an agreeable diagnosis for the condition(s).

I packed my stuff, including one of their cupboard full of blankets, musing in recollection of the theft of my cannabis from earlier, and walked back into the (morning?) grey skies.

It had stopped raining, and so I walked through some quaint Ghent neighbourhoods and found a McDonalds to charge my phone, use their WiFi, and drink a coffee. I decide to take a sip and decide I have written enough for the moment, time to have a begged cigarette outside then post this on the Internet.

I haven‚Äôt craved sugar in over six months. I got through Easter, birthdays, dinners out, all of it without any issues. I‚Äôve been eating really healthy and sticking to my goals for a long time.

Now, since starting Ozempic, the binging is out of control. Last night I ate a huge bag of Skittles in 10 minutes. I even binged on a whole bag of sugar-free cough drops, which was a terrible idea. I know people will say ‚Äújust don‚Äôt buy it,‚Äù and that makes sense in theory, but the cravings feel completely overwhelming. It honestly feels similar to being on an edible and getting the munchies. The hunger and urge to eat won‚Äôt stop.

I‚Äôm eating a minimum of 100 grams of protein a day. My meals usually include eggs, cottage cheese, chicken or steak, vegetables, and oatmeal. I also take hair gummies, magnesium bisglycinate, zinc, a multivitamin, vitamin B12, and fiber gummies every single day. I add collagen powder to my coffee once a day too. I feel like I‚Äôm doing everything right.

Today alone I‚Äôm already 600 calories over my daily limit of 1300, which I was able to stick to easily before Ozempic. I feel starving and totally out of control. Is this normal at the beginning? Does it eventually settle down? I would really appreciate any advice or personal experiences. I was prescribed ozempic due to being overweight but also as a means to treat my BED and bulimia.

1kuh8ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kuh8ic/can_the_antarctic_star_countertop_ice_maker_truly/,Can the Antarctic Star Countertop Ice Maker Truly Transform Your Cooling Experience Review?,"The Antarctic Star IMB1001-UL Ice Maker has become an indispensable addition to my daily routine, especially during warm summer days when cold beverages are non-negotiable. It's sleek, compact, and promises a lot for its size. As I tested this countertop ice machine for over a few weeks, I uncovered its quirks, saw its strengths, and, admittedly, found a few elements that could be a tad better. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know.

**Sleek Design and Compactness**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the ice maker's thoughtful design. With dimensions of 11.93""D x 9.8""W x 11.1""H, it‚Äôs designed to fit seamlessly on almost any countertop, whether that‚Äôs in a home kitchen, a dorm, or even an office space. Setting it up in my cramped kitchen didn‚Äôt feel like a compromise‚Äîit looked right at home next to my blender and coffee maker. The all-black finish added a classy vibe, giving it an appearance more premium than its size might suggest. When hosting a small gathering, I even moved it to the outdoor patio, and its lightweight build (under 15 pounds) made it ridiculously easy to relocate.

**Performance and Speed**  
I can't emphasize enough how impressed I was with its efficiency. The Antarctic Star ice maker can churn out up to 26 pounds of ice within 24 hours. When I realized it could deliver nine bullet-shaped cubes in just under six minutes, I knew I wasn‚Äôt going back to waiting for those old-school ice-tray molds to freeze. This feature was a lifesaver during an intense board game night with friends. Regular household use was a breeze; I never ran out of cubes, as it kept up with my family's demands.

[Find the best price for Antarctic Star IMB1001-UL on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0cwr3tyrn/)

**Customizable Ice Cube Sizes**  
The ability to choose between small and large bullet-shaped ice cubes is one of its most underrated features. Small cubes worked perfectly for quick-blended smoothies, eliminating the need for pre-crushed ice, while the larger cubes kept my iced coffee colder for longer. It's always nice when a machine gives you that little bit of extra control over something as simple as ice. Switching the size is effortless using its intuitive control panel, which feels refreshingly straightforward.

**Self-Cleaning Feature**  
Cleaning appliances is a chore I loathe, but this ice maker decided to save me from that trouble. Engaging the self-cleaning function was ridiculously straightforward‚Äîholding down the ""STAR"" button for five seconds did the trick. I let it run weekly as per the manual, accompanied by some warm soapy water, and my ice machine stayed looking spotless. The convenience here is something I deeply appreciate.

**Noise Levels During Operation**  
One of my concerns before trying the product was the noise‚Äîit‚Äôs always a gamble with machines like this. Thankfully, this ice maker isn‚Äôt out here to disrupt your peaceful home ambiance. Although it produces a gentle hum while churns out cubes, it‚Äôs barely noticeable once you're used to it. This quiet operation made it a favorite even during nighttime, keeping everyone happy and undisturbed.

**Water and Ice Basket Alerts**  
Another neat feature I found was the indicator lights for the water reservoir and ice basket. The little LED lights inform you if it‚Äôs time to refill the water or when the ice basket is full‚Äîso there‚Äôs no guessing game involved. It‚Äôs one of those things you take for granted until you realize how convenient it is.

**Highlights**  
- Super-fast ice production: 9 cubes in 6 minutes.  
- Compact, lightweight design, suitable for small spaces.  
- Choice of small or large bullet-shaped cubes.  
- User-friendly control panel with indicator lights.  
- Advanced self-cleaning mode simplifies maintenance.

**Pitfalls**  
- The 1.2L water tank works fine for small batches, but I found myself refilling it more often when hosting bigger groups.  
- Limited ice storage capacity‚Äîit could hold more, given its production power.  
- Black finish shows fingerprints easily, which means it needs regular wiping to keep it looking pristine.

**Product Comparisons**  
In the countertop ice maker arena, there‚Äôs no shortage of alternatives. The GE Opal Nugget Ice Maker certainly comes to mind as a rival product, especially for those obsessed with pebble-style ice. However, the GE model costs significantly more and occupies a larger footprint, making it less portable and less budget-friendly. The Antarctic Star ice maker, with its compact size and mid-range price, feels like the more practical option for households without niche ice preferences. Compared to budget options like the Igloo ice maker, the Antarctic Star offers better build quality, quieter operation, and features like the self-cleaning function‚Äîmaking it easily worth the extra cost.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering all its features, from speedy ice-making to the convenience of self-cleaning, this ice maker punches well above its price category. Sure, there are more fully-featured (and expensive) units out there, but if you‚Äôre looking for solid day-to-day performance without breaking the bank, this gadget is an investment that makes sense. It‚Äôs the ideal intersection of functionality and affordability.

Now, since starting Ozempic, the binging is out of control. Last night I ate a huge bag of Skittles in 10 minutes. I even binged on a whole bag of sugar-free cough drops, which was a terrible idea. I know people will say ‚Äújust don‚Äôt buy it,‚Äù and that makes sense in theory, but the cravings feel completely overwhelming.

This is my first time posting and I'm extremely grateful for any feedback. Thanks so much!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Dear *\[Agent\]*,

*\[Personalization\].* I‚Äôm excited to share THE BEAUTY QUEEN, a 90,000-word contemporary mystery, that blends the humor and family dynamics of Nina Simon‚Äôs MOTHER-DAUGHTER MURDER NIGHT with the hometown whodunit of NICE GIRLS by Catherine Dang.¬†

Riley Wong is a woman with a plan. Or she was. Once an honors graduate with a promising future, Riley lands unemployed and living back with her mother and grandmother in her small hometown, a place so homogenous and culturally unaware that even cooked sushi is considered ‚Äúexotic.‚Äù Determined to make the best of a bad situation, Riley finds a job at the local coffee shop, spending her free time meandering the historic cemetery with her dog and favorite true crime podcasts.

When local beauty queen Katrina Olsen goes missing, the police deem it a runaway case. Fueled by her knowledge of true crime and the town‚Äôs suspicious ill will toward Katrina, Riley is convinced that foul play is involved. The stakes are raised when Riley discovers that Katrina is her sister - one she never knew she had - through her White father, who long ago abandoned his fatherhood duties. Determined to forge a connection with her newfound family and reconnect with her father, Riley becomes embroiled in the search for Katrina, chasing down suspects from Katrina‚Äôs pageant rival to her mysterious boyfriend in Los Angeles.

As Riley dives deeper into Katrina‚Äôs life, she uncovers that Katrina had a secret admirer whose obsession may have gone too far - and who knows Riley is onto him. When Riley starts receiving threats, she realizes that she must solve the case to save not only Katrina, but herself before she becomes the next victim.

Like Riley, I‚Äôm half-Chinese and grew up in a small predominantly white town. I‚Äôm a director at a clean energy non-profit and live in Northern California with my family. THE BEAUTY QUEEN is my debut novel.

1kuh6pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/2under2/comments/1kuh6pw/toys_thats_not_yours/,Toys - 'That's not yours!',"Looking to see what everyone else is doing. Particularly how it translates as your kids get older. Currently my girls are 24 months and 6 months so baby is now grabbing toys and playing more etc. My toddler often snatches things away from the baby and will yell 'Noooo that's not yours!' 

My first response originally was to encourage her to take turns. So I would tell her we don't snatch toys from each other and baby is playing with that right now, it can be your turn next. Then after a minute or two I would take the toy from baby, say it's toddlers turn now and let toddler have a turn. 

The other week I had an epiphany though and curious on other peoples thoughts. I realized for one that the 'that's not yours' phrase is likely coming from when my toddler tries to drink my coffee and I tell her no that's not yours that mommy's. This got me thinking about the toy thing more from my toddler's perspective. All of the toys for the most part were in fact hers and then suddenly this new person is on the scene and suddenly she has to share everything she owns. 

I think it's reasonable and normal for people to have things they are willing to share with others and things they aren't. So I was trying to figure out how to give my toddler the same grace. 

The past few days I've tried this approach instead. Baby tried to grab these picture cards that my toddler plays with all the time. Last week the baby actually ripped one and it made my toddler really upset. Baby grabbed cards and my toddler yelled 'NO NOT YOURS' This time I took the card from the baby. I told my toddler you really don't want baby playing with these do you? Maybe because she broke one last time? My toddler stopped crying and just looked at me. Then I asked her. Can you find a toy that you are ok with the baby playing with? 

My toddler said YEAH! and started grabbing toy after toy and placing them in front of the baby and of course the baby was kicking and laughing and so happy with all of her new options and my toddler was happy to have her cards be safe. 

Does this approach make sense? Pros and cons long term? How do you guys handle this? 
Do you let your kids have some items they don't have to share if they don't want to?

Drop a comment ""yes"" and I‚Äôll send you the complete novel.","My new husband is disabled, yet he manages to wear me out every night.

How About We Get Married?  
""Kaelyn knows about our wedding, and now she's threatening to jump off a building. You are aware of her depression, aren't you? I have to go save her,"" Theo explained impatiently and pushed Elyse aside.  
  
""Today is our wedding day! What am I supposed to do if you leave? Kaelyn Bennett totally stabbed you in the back before. She's caused you so much pain-why the heck must you go see her right now?""  
  
The push caused Elyse to sprain her ankle, and as she fell to the floor, she awkwardly stretched out her hand, trying to hold him back.  
  
Theo's gaze turned even colder. ""You're not in a position to judge what happened between me and Kaelyn. No matter her wrongs or the pain she caused, you don't measure up to her.""  
  
A pain struck Elyse's heart. She realized that he had never truly forgotten Kaelyn. To him, she would never be as significant as Kaelyn was.  
  
""What did I do to deserve this? Why are you treating me this way? Please, just wait until the wedding is over. We're almost at the point of exchanging rings. You can leave after that.""  
  
Theo dodged her hand and said with disgust, ""You're more concerned with your wedding than a living person's life. You're so heartless. Let's reschedule the wedding.""  
  
Without a glance at her pale face, he strode away from the ornate altar, oblivious to the puzzled looks of gathered guests.  
  
As the groom left, the crowd erupted into chaos.  
  
""No, please don't leave me, Theo! What should I do if you leave?"" Elyse cried out, sitting pitifully on the floor. She trembled, tears ruining her carefully applied makeup.  
  
The man she had loved for three years, disregarding her dignity, had chosen another woman without a second thought on their big day. He was consumed with thoughts of Kaelyn's distress but seemed indifferent to how lost and humiliated she felt, left alone at the altar.  
All around her, countless eyes watched, some mocking, some pitying, and others even gloating. Elyse had never felt such torment!  
  
Her father, Lanny Lloyd, approached. She hoped for comfort, but instead, he scolded her sharply, ""You can't even keep a man. How useless!"" After berating her, he left with his wife, Glenda Lloyd, without a backward glance.  
  
Her sister, Mabel Lloyd, emerged from the crowd with a smirk. ""Well, that's embarrassing, Elyse. Your groom ran off, and now you're a laughingstock. I'm embarrassed for you. Imagine how Mom and Dad feel."" After saying that, she turned and left.  
  
One by one, all of Elyse's family members departed, leaving her completely alone. Initially, Theo's parents felt guilty, but upon witnessing her family's reaction, all traces of guilt dissipated.  
  
""Even her own parents didn't support her. It seems this isn't entirely Theo's fault.""  
  
""Yes, if she were a good partner, why would her fianc√© leave her?""  
  
""Did she cheat on him? What else would make a groom leave like that?""  
  
The murmurs of criticism from the surrounding guests grew louder and harsher.  
  
Suddenly, there were noises nearby.  
  
Turning around, Elyse spotted a man in a suit sitting alone in a wheelchair. The officiant, looking flustered, asked, ""Where is your bride?""  
  
Wiping away her tears, she halted a passing staff member and inquired, ""That man is a groom, right? Where is his bride?""  
  
The staff member glanced at her and responded, ""She didn't show up. I heard it was because she couldn't deal with her husband's disability.""  
  
""And he's been waiting here all this time?""  
  
The staff member nodded.  
  
The wheelchair-bound groom was facing away from Elyse, and they were a fair distance apart. She couldn't see his expression, but she understood the pain of being left alone.  
They were both unfortunate souls, abandoned.  
  
After a moment of reflection, a determined look settled in Elyse's eyes.  
  
She had loved Theo for three years, but he had betrayed her. Why should she remain loyal to him? She realized she didn't need to be with him at all.  
  
As she suddenly stood up, the guests who had been whispering and mocking her fell silent. All eyes instinctively focused on her as she lifted the hem of her dress and confidently walked toward the man in the wheelchair.  
  
The sight of a bride in a white wedding dress approaching left the man's guests equally stunned.  
  
Hearing the rustle of her dress, the man in the wheelchair turned around slowly.  
  
Elyse halted and gazed at the handsome man before her, a spark of surprise in her eyes. She then extended her hand and said, ""Hello, I heard you're in need of a bride. My groom just left me. How about we get married?""  
  
  
Chapter2 What Was She Up To?  
""My name is Elyse Lloyd. If it's all right with you, we can get married today,"" she proposed confidently.  
  
Her bold proposal left the crowd in shock, prompting several to capture the moment with their phones.  
  
""Miss Lloyd, are you certain about this decision? Given my disability, I may not be able to provide the future you envision,"" the man replied openly, without hiding his condition, and gently urged her to think it over.  
  
""I've made up my mind,"" Elyse responded with determination.  
  
""I'm Jayden,"" he introduced himself.  
  
Seeing her resolve, Jayden Owen grasped her hand and shared his concern, ""I fear you might regret this choice later on.""  
  
Elyse chose not to respond. She was sure of her decision. She had once been solely focused on marrying Theo, who never truly reciprocated her love. Now, who she married seemed inconsequential.  
  
After efficiently wrapping up the wedding formalities at City Hall, Elyse and Jayden were now bound by matrimony, officially united as husband and wife.  
  
With the marriage certificate in hand, Elyse experienced a profound sense of relief.  
  
Theo had broken her heart, and she was resolute in never returning to him.  
  
Regarding her father, since she would not be marrying into the Ward family, he had another daughter to think about.  
  
She understood her little sister Mabel too well. As someone driven by greed, how could Mabel resist the temptation to become Theo's wife and a member of the Ward family?  
  
Thus, marrying Jayden was Elyse's perfect escape from her family's clutches. She had no intention of going back home again.  
  
While she gazed thoughtfully at the marriage certificate, Jayden asked, ""What's on your mind? Regretting your decision to marry a disabled man?""  
  
Elyse shook her head, took hold of the wheelchair, and replied, ""I think it was a good decision.""  
  
Jayden smiled slightly, though his eyes betrayed a hint of skepticism and mistrust.  
  
How could any woman genuinely want to marry a disabled man? He figured she was just putting on an act-an act that couldn't last forever.  
  
He needed a bride momentarily to distract his family while he pursued his own goals. Well, he decided, he might as well see what she was up to.  
  
Elyse helped Jayden into the car, and they drove to his house.  
  
Jayden's home was opulent, complete with a garden and a swimming pool, and staffed with a butler in a tuxedo and uniformed maids.  
  
As Elyse stepped onto the plush wool carpet, she truly realized that her new husband was far from ordinary.  
  
The butler, Driscoll Lee, approached them respectfully and inquired, ""Mr. Owen, is this your bride?""  
  
Surveying the opulent house and recollecting her newlywed husband's full name, a sudden realization dawned on Elyse.  
  
The Owens were the most influential family in town, and Jayden Owen was particularly notable among his peers for his business acumen and exceptional talent. He was one of the wealthiest men around. However, after a car accident a year ago that cost him his legs, Jayden had faded from the public eye and his prior achievements were largely forgotten.  
  
So, she had married the legendary Jayden Owen?  
  
Elyse recalled hearing rumors about his engagement to a girl from the Foster family. The bride who had disappeared on her wedding day was supposed to be that Foster girl.  
  
Upon hearing Jayden's full name at City Hall, Elyse hadn't dwelled on it much. If she had known his background sooner, she wouldn't have had the courage to broach the topic of marriage with him.  
  
Jayden noticed the shock and panic on her face but remained silent. He still doubted that she truly hadn't recognized him. After all, his disability was well known.  
  
""This is Elyse Lloyd, my wife. From now on, she will be the hostess here,"" Jayden introduced her firmly.  
  
""Joanna Foster escaped on our wedding day because she didn't want to marry a disabled man,"" he added bluntly.  
  
""Joanna Foster disappeared on the wedding day?"" Driscoll expressed his surprise. The Foster family had been eager to forge a union with the Owen family through marriage, pushing for Jayden to marry Joanna.  
  
On the wedding day, however, the bride had disappeared. Wasn't this a deliberate humiliation of Jayden?  
  
Driscoll felt sympathy for him and offered some consolation, ""Sir, perhaps it's for the best that she left. It seems you might have found the right person after all.""  
  
Elyse had shown no concern for Jayden's disability and was willing to marry him. That indeed counted for something.  
  
  
Chapter3 He Could Walk Fluidly  
Looking at Jayden's legs, Elyse felt a wave of sympathy for him. Jayden had once been at the pinnacle of success, and now he seemed so vulnerable. Just because he was disabled, his bride had callously abandoned him at the altar, showing him no respect whatsoever. He must have felt even more devastated than she did during the wedding.  
  
Approaching Jayden, Elyse took his hand and said earnestly, ""Don't worry. We are husband and wife now. I will take care of you for the rest of our lives.""  
  
Jayden's expression turned rigid. Could she really mean it, promising to take care of him for a lifetime? He doubted her sincerity, thinking she was just putting on an act of compassion.  
  
Without a word, Jayden maneuvered his wheelchair into the study on the first floor.  
  
""I'm sorry,"" Driscoll said apologetically. ""Since his accident, he's been a bit more temperamental.""  
  
""It's fine. I understand,"" Elyse replied, dismissing it with a wave of her hand. Anyone in his situation might change.  
  
She then followed Driscoll upstairs to a room on the second floor.  
  
\--  
  
""Sir.""  
  
In the study stood a bald man named Vinny Bailey, clad in a tight black shirt that accentuated his prominent tendons.  
  
Respectfully, Vinny ignited a lighter and lit a cigar for Jayden.  
  
""Joanna has gone abroad. The Foster family is desperately trying to come up with a solution.""  
  
""They've taken thirty million and five major projects from me. Is this their way of repaying me?""  
  
Jayden let out a puff of smoke and remarked casually, ""If I don't teach them a lesson, others will see me as a pushover. The Fosters need to learn a few things.""  
  
""Do you want us to bring Joanna back?"" Vinny inquired, nodding. ""And as for your new wife, should we make some introductions with our men?""  
  
""No need.""  
  
Jayden, cigar clenched between his teeth, lifted a document from the desk and strolled over to the window.  
  
The wheelchair was tucked away in a corner of the room, ignored, as he moved fluidly across the floor.  
  
This document detailed Elyse's entire life, from her childhood through to her college life, even including her romance with Theo.  
  
He casually flipped through the pages and drawled, ""An ordinary woman. She married me just for my money.""  
Back then, the Owens had declared their search for a wife for Jayden, aiming simply to secure an heir.  
  
Upon the announcement, no wealthy family was eager to marry their daughter to him, except for the Fosters, who had enriched themselves through their daughters' marriage.  
  
The Fosters' motive was straightforward-to exchange their daughter for resources and money.  
  
Vinny saw no other reason for Elyse to marry Jayden but for financial gain.  
  
Yet, there was another twist. ""She was originally going to marry Theo Ward.""  
  
""Ward? The Ward family that's well-known?"" Jayden lifted an eyebrow.  
  
""Yes. But apparently, the groom ran off to reunite with his ex-girlfriend after receiving a phone call.""  
  
Vinny paused, then speculated, ""Maybe she married you just to spite Theo Ward.""  
  
Jayden ceased perusing the documents and glanced up at Vinny with a hint of annoyance. ""You're looking at it too simplistically. By marrying me, she stands to gain more. That's the real reason she married me, despite my disability.""  
  
In Jayden's eyes, Elyse hadn't yet revealed her true intentions. But he didn't mind her interest in his money.  
  
He needed a wife to appease his family. If she married him for gain, it would make a future divorce simpler for him.  
  
\--  
  
Perched on the edge of the bed, Elysee scrolled through her phone and noticed the trending topics.  
  
\#Bridegroom Ran Away For His Ex  
  
\#Bride Marries Stranger To Anger Her Ranaway Groom  
  
She casually scrolled through the comments. The public deemed the entire situation unbelievable and both parties' actions as unreasonable. Nevertheless, discussions had thrust Elyse's name into circulation because of it.  
  
Some even discovered she was a violinist in an orchestra and stumbled upon a video of her past performance.  
  
Unable to resist, Elyse was watching these videos when Theo called. ""Where are you, Elyse? Let's meet and talk.""  
  
  
Chapter4 Who Were You Married To?  
As Elyse descended the stairs to the villa's entrance, Driscoll approached her with concern. ""It's quite late. Where are you off to? Shall I arrange a car for you?""  
  
""No, thanks. I'll be back soon.""  
  
Driscoll watched her depart before heading to the study.  
  
Elyse, having agreed to meet Theo, called a taxi and was soon en route.  
  
Fifteen minutes later, she entered a coffee shop and instantly noticed Theo, who was in high spirits, busy texting on his phone. A flicker of sarcasm crossed her eyes as she approached and sat across from him.  
  
Theo looked up, his expression souring. ""Why are you so late? Do you have any idea how long I've been waiting?""  
  
Staring back at him, Elyse felt a chill. They had been together for a long time, yet he was always domineering toward her, a stark contrast to his demeanor with Kaelyn.  
  
She had once loved him, believing she could endure anything. Only today had she realized how foolish that was.  
  
If she didn't love herself, how could she expect anyone else to love her?  
  
""If you don't want to wait, you can leave,"" Elyse retorted icily.  
  
Theo, taken aback by her response, grew visibly more upset. ""You're holding a grudge about what happened at the wedding, aren't you? I get why you're upset, but you can't be more understanding and reasonable? I left because Kaelyn was in dire straits-she was depressed and contemplating suicide.""  
  
""You can go to anyone you want. You don't need to explain anything to me-I don't care anymore."" Elyse found humor in his words.  
  
Theo couldn't believe she was indifferent. They had been together for three years, and everyone knew how deeply she loved him.  
  
He thought her claim of indifference was merely a result of anger. But he was confident he could easily resolve this. Just a few sweet words and she'd come back to him.  
  
""It's not a big deal. I came back to you after handling everything, didn't I? I'll visit your parents soon, and we can start planning the wedding again,"" Theo said.  
  
""No need for that.""  
  
""What?""  
  
""There won't be a wedding."" Elyse's face was devoid of emotion. ""We're done.""  
  
""Why are you still upset? I left at the wedding, but I came back for you. Can't you forgive me?"" Theo frowned.  
  
""Forgive you? Forgive you for abandoning me for another woman?"" Elyse slammed her hand on the table. ""Do you have any idea what I've been through since you left? Your family has been calling me names, even though you were the one who left me at the altar- just for another woman!""  
  
""Elyse Lloyd!"" Theo shouted her name furiously. ""What others say is their issue. Isn't our three-year relationship strong enough for you to trust me?""  
  
""Three years, and yet you never forgot your ex,"" Elyse countered, her face marked by disappointment. ""I believed we'd be together forever, but it seems three years was our limit. We're done, Theo. It's clear we're not suited for each other.""  
  
While speaking, she retrieved a ring from her bag and set it down on the table-the same ring he had used to propose.  
  
She recalled the joy she felt that day, now overshadowed by her current despair.  
  
Elyse gave Theo one last look, mentally closing the chapter on their three years together. She grabbed her bag and departed without a backward glance.  
  
Theo was stunned. Was Elyse dumping him? He always saw her as a simp, her family reliant on his. How could she just walk away?  
  
Humiliated, he chased after her, grabbed her shoulder, and said forcefully, ""You have no right to break things off! Remember, your father's business relies on me. Without me, your family has nothing. Come back, and we'll marry in a few days to make up for today!""  
  
""Let me go!"" Elyse fought back fiercely and yelled with defiance and frustration, ""I'm married. Stop bothering me!""  
  
""So what if you are married! You will always belong to me.""  
  
After blurting that out, he froze and asked incredulously, ""What did you say? You're married? Who to?""  
  
While he was momentarily dazed, Elyse wriggled free from his grip. She hadn't anticipated turning around to find Jayden sitting in a wheelchair quietly a few meters behind her. ""Jayden!"" she exclaimed.",1,1748108116.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

For years, being a software developer meant near-guaranteed job security. If you could write a ‚ÄúHello, World‚Äù program, you were already in demand.

But those days are gone. And while I knew it, I got to witness it personally recently.

In a recent hiring round, I interviewed developers with nearly three decades of experience‚Äîbrilliant minds‚Äîwho‚Äôve been out of work for over a year. Others are stuck in roles they don‚Äôt enjoy, afraid to jump ship in this climate.

Now imagine what it‚Äôs like for the fresh grads. They‚Äôve spent years studying, dreaming about launching their careers‚Ä¶ only to graduate into radio silence. It‚Äôs heartbreaking.

I wish I could hire every promising junior I meet‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt. Standards matter. And I‚Äôve also seen the flip side: candidates who‚Äôve spent two years studying but ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt really learned much coding,‚Äù or who turn down a coffee meeting at 08:30 because it‚Äôs ‚Äúa little early.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt say this to gatekeep. I say it because I care.

If you‚Äôre early in your dev career, here‚Äôs the one mindset shift that will change everything:

Act like you‚Äôre already on the job.

Build things. Ship projects. Show up early. Ask great questions. Make it obvious that not hiring you would be a strategic error.

This isn‚Äôt hustle culture. It‚Äôs entry fee reality.

Software is still one of the greatest careers in the world‚Äîbut today, the on-ramp is steeper, and the passengers are more crowded. The ones who break through aren‚Äôt just skilled. They‚Äôre relentless.

What‚Äôs one thing you did early in your career that made all the difference? I‚Äôd love to hear your story‚Äîand I know the juniors reading this would too.",0,1748108050.0,csMajors,6,0.33,False

In a move that‚Äôs sure to send shockwaves through the veteran advocacy community, military authorities have announced that it‚Äôs time to liquidate the CAUSA member. No, this isn‚Äôt a headline ripped from a spy novel ‚Äî it‚Äôs the latest chapter in the ongoing effort to streamline operations and cut the dead weight from our ranks.

**What Is CAUSA Anyway?**

For those who‚Äôve been living under a rock (or perhaps in a bunker), CAUSA is the Coalition of American Veterans for Unilateral Action. A once-promising organization dedicated to veteran advocacy, CAUSA has recently become the poster child for bureaucracy gone rogue ‚Äî more interested in fundraising dinners and political posturing than actually helping veterans.

**Why Liquidate Now?**

Sources close to the decision say CAUSA‚Äôs latest activities have crossed the line from advocacy into outright sabotage. Rumor has it that their latest annual report was printed on recycled fortune cookie paper and was more empty than a desert Eagle after a 3-day ammo shortage.

But more seriously, the decision comes after a thorough review of CAUSA‚Äôs operational effectiveness, which, frankly, is comparable to trying to herd cats during a hurricane. Leadership has concluded that the organization no longer serves its intended purpose and is actively hindering veteran support initiatives.

**The Plan: Operation Clean Sweep**

The military-style operation will proceed in three phases:

1. **Disinformation Disruption**: Deploy a series of targeted information campaigns to confuse and discredit CAUSA‚Äôs leadership, making their internal communications resemble a game of telephone played by drunken parrots.
2. **Asset Seizure and Reassignment**: Identify and secure all physical and digital assets‚Äîthink servers, files, and that mysterious vault behind their office bookshelf. These will be repurposed to bolster more effective veteran programs.
3. **Final Extraction and Liquidation**: Once CAUSA‚Äôs operational infrastructure is neutralized, leadership will be gently but firmly escorted out, and the organization will be formally dissolved. Remaining members will be offered alternative veteran support channels‚Äîpreferably ones that actually get things done.

**Expected Outcomes**

By executing this plan, the military hopes to eliminate the bureaucratic bottleneck that CAUSA has become, freeing up resources to focus on real veteran issues like mental health, employment, and a decent cup of coffee at veterans‚Äô centers.

**In Conclusion**

It‚Äôs a new dawn, a new day, and a new era for veteran advocacy. Sometimes, you have to cut the dead weight to move forward. So, gear up, stay sharp, and remember: in the end, it‚Äôs all about supporting those who served.

I was haveing a nice evening, had a glass of rum, my crochet, my sister, some music on. 

Got a text message from my naibor (old enough to be my dad) saying he was spiraling and needed some company, that's cool, I've been there, I've done that, I'm sure I can offer something helpful, I have a degree in social care maby I can recommend some recorces yeah? 

So he comes over, I make him a coffee, he takes my bottle of rum and adds a shot to his coffee, sure whatever sometimes I need a drink too. 

The he spends 2 hours truma dumping... Sure I can listen, I can offer imput when prompted. 

He progressively drank more and more of rum while touching my stuff, swinging between telling me how awesome I was and how patheic I was. Cool, rant away I'm happy to listen till you feel better. 

Then he picked up my cat (after I told him not too, my cat hates strangers and hates being picked up) and then he called my cat an asshole when he got scratched. 

Then he insulted my sister, then asked what he did wrong when I said that was out of order.

I had to ask him to stop shouting more than once, my daughter was asleep in the room next door. 

The he scratched one of my records, an original print of the Adam and the ants prince charming album :( I can't replace that

He finnished my rum

He kept touching my hair and then glaring at me when I flinched. 

Then he tried 3 times to kiss me, licked  my face trying to stick his tongue in my mouth, tried to bite my neck then told me off for shakeing, I was holding back from punching him, he's had a stroke and I don't want to be responsible for him haveing a second one. 

The he threatened to kill himself if I didn't kiss him, started saying ""I shouldn't be doing this, (my spouse) wouldn't like it"" and then went on a rant about how he should just die. 

I rang his friend to talk to him and it took us almost 30 minutes to get him out my house, into his flat downstairs and then get us out there. 

Now I'm scared to leave my house :(

I like helping people, I don't like unwanted body contact at all. And I've always been nervous around drunk people, my dad was an abusive alcoholic. 

What do I even do about this? I'm not sure, my spouse is away for work at the moment, thank god my sister was here, my spouse is sending one if his friends over to talk to him later but I just feel really uncomfortable now. I was raped repeadly when I was 15 by a man who wanted to un-trans me by showing me ""how good it is to be a woman"" and that's how I got my daughter (who I love and don't blame her for how she was conceived at all, she's a princess and it's not her fault at all) but this has brought all of those memories back, I feel really violated.

(And wanting out),"I am 37F and he is 42M, let's call him C. He has 2 kids from a previous marriage, 6 and 10, he separated 4 years ago, moved out 2 years ago and started dating me 1.5 years ago.

I am also separated and moved out about 2 years ago. After my marriage fell apart (among other things) because of lack of intimacy and support (not standing for me when his family forced their decisions on us etc) I tried to rebuild my life, sort out my living conditions (after I left the house to him) and being true to myself. So when I met C we were immediately close because we like exactly the same things. He was everything that lacked in my marriage, we have similar stories and are in sync in a way that I have never experienced in my life. Intimacy is the best I ever had in my whole life after 10y of nothing, we love the same music, we have the same spiritual beliefs, he just fit in so nicely with my friends group. He is a person with a lot of depth, that I really admire.

I knew about his kids when I met him, and I always said it's ok for me because my heart is big enough for 2 more. to be honest when we started to realise it wasn't just physical attraction but we started talking future plans together I even thought that given my age it's actually ideal to have 2 of his kids around because I always wanted 0 or 2 kids of my own (I was an only child for 8 years and that was... well, lonely!), so if they already have siblings that would feel less sad that I am at an age where conceiving naturally might be less easy and I'd be lucky if I can have one after a divorce.  
I always worked with children so I feel very positive about meeting them and I would always know my place.

However I have to say, I am needy. I was raised in an abusive family and even after years of therapy I need constant reassurance of love. My love language unfortunately is quality time.

When I met him, he said he sees his kids 2 times a week (omitting that it's always at the weekend). So after a few months of dating only on weekdays, I started to be less productive at work and almost risked my job because I was constantly tired and I stopped studying in my free time (my job is very demanding and in the past I studied after work and used the weekends to do exciting things, like hiking or mini weekends)

The moment my job was at risk I decided to enforce a boundary, so I said from now on I am not meeting him on weekdays, that if he wants I am free Friday to Sunday. That eventually led to us to continue to meet during weekdays but do less exciting things, basically we are just at mine or his watching telly. While I still didn't recover my healthy routine of exercise and studying, I feel more productive at work and so far at least that is ok.

But then I continued to spiral because he very rarely allocates quality time days to me, and he agreed to do ""alternating weekends"" with his ex. They live 10 mins from each others. she won't let him see his kids on weekdays because she thinks they get too excited (bs, she is just manipulative and controlling) and they are sleepy at school.

Then they finally managed to get him to see kids also on Thursdays and Fridays, but what happens now is that basically he sees his kids 3-4 days a week. Leaving for me just the Monday to Wednesday. We are not out in the open yet because he thinks is better to do that after the divorce is finalised since she resents him a lot and when she knew about us she made threats.

In all this time I have been through some minor health issues and mental health challenges. He obviously can't be there for me in case of emergency because god forbid he drops them off before the agreed time. We haven't been able to go on a holiday longer than 2 days and when we did it was because he fought massively for that and then she threatened to financially destroy him. He once suggested a holiday last minute (I have to apply for annual leave 15-30 days in advance) just because she took the kids on a trip, but god forbid he can take a trip when they are around. I refused to book the holiday because even if I don't have kids I have commitments and I am a person too, I have needs too. I can't always be a pushover and risk my job, so I said no. And because of that, in his book, we have never been on holiday because I said no to this particular one and not because we can't plan things spontaneously with more than 1 week notice. Because he has to do what she says and because kids first.

After we had arguments I started seeing more of what C and his ex call ""alternating weekends"" that in other words means he has them Thursday-Friday-half day Saturday, or Friday-Sat-Sunday. What are they alternating exactly is known only to them.

When we have a Sat night together and we go to a gig I am so tired the next day that the Sunday we really never end up going for a walk, get a coffee... nothing. It's all so dull.

I miss when with my ex we used to go for long morning walks together, I miss being taken out somewhere for dinner, I miss always waking up next to my man. I feel very lonely.

I am now breaking up with him for never prioritising me. I feel horrible because having had terrible parents myself I would never want a child to suffer what I went through, so now I am in this conflict where I think that if I ask to meet my needs I am doing wrong to 2 poor children, but if I don't I am hurting myself.  
Should I keep fighting to help my man understand he can be a good dad even if he doesn't have every weekend with them? I feel horrible when I do.

Also, cherry on the cake... early on, after he told me about his baggage (crazy ex and 2 kids) I told him mine (woman close to her 40s divorced wanting a kid) he said that it's his vocation to be a dad, that if things go well between us we are on the same page. However after months, after I fell for him, he said that he changed his mind because his life is too complicated to fit my biological clock. Months later he said he is open to it. Hot and cold paired with his absence isn't painting a good picture for my future.

Needless to say that it broke my heart and even if I love all about him (kids included) I feel like starting a family with him one day would mean that me and my kid would never be prioritised. He is always taking them to more than 10 classes that are sure not cheap, and then of course he has never brought me out for dinner once. I am not the type of woman who is after money, I have my career and I am satisfied with what I can provide to myself, but I can't help but notice when every time they are out they go out for lunch/dinner and classes but I am feeling more and more just a side kick in his life.

I am ok with men with kids, but I want to feel prioritised, protected. I understand he doesn't have it to give unfortunately.

He is begging me to stay, promising the moon that when we are out in the open things will change, we will live together and I will be part of their plans, but my ideal weekend isn't doing one of the hundreds kids music classes, what will it be like? me going out with my friends coming back home drunk at 1 am and then at least I see him in bed? Or what about if we have kids together? daddy can't be here because he has to take the other 2 to 10 different music instrument classes? I am sorry but I also feel embarrassed to say, in my country we did classes on weekdays and at the weekend we used to rest, and by no means I have voice on how they choose to raise them but it's so different from how I would do things with mine. Most of all, if I can't afford it I would ask my kid which one they like the most and maybe prioritise 2-3 classes, not so many! I don't know. I feel I am a horrible person being jealous of their time and different treatment ... so much that I decided to remove myself and let them be.

Just my luck, the one time I found a man that I love to bits... I apologise for my English, it's not my first language. I am heartbroken but I need to know. AITAH?",1,1748107832.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

I‚Äôve got a quick question! If I were to join as a team leader, do you think I‚Äôd still be respected by the team, even though I‚Äôd be coming in externally?

The reason I ask is that in some of the places I‚Äôve worked before, I‚Äôve noticed that people don‚Äôt always take too well to supervisors who are hired from outside rather than promoted from within. I know every company‚Äôs culture is different, so I just wanted to hear from anyone who‚Äôs been in or around that kind of situation, especially at Costa.

For context, I‚Äôve worked as a supervisor in another coffee brand before and always tried to keep things positive and motivating for the team. I used to set small extra targets just for fun‚Ä¶ nothing that took priority over store goals ‚Äî but they often lined up anyway. If we smashed those, I‚Äôd reward the team however I could. It felt like a nice way to recognise hard work and keep the atmosphere upbeat. Plus, when we hit more targets, the team would often see more bonuses, so it ended up being a bit of a win-win.

I was that guy ‚Äî compulsively swiping on apps despite getting no matches, frequenting bars looking for connection, even dipping into pickup artist ‚Äúdaygame‚Äù stuff. I truly believed that unless I constantly chased relationships, I‚Äôd end up alone.

Eventually, through journaling and honest introspection, I realized how toxic and exhausting this mindset had become. It was taking over my time, self-worth, and energy.

I came up with a plan that helped me stop the compulsive cycle and rebuild a healthier relationship with myself first ‚Äî and now I want to share it. I‚Äôm still in like stage 13 of this process, but if it resonates with you, feel free to come along.

# üß† Step 1: Understand Your Attachment Style

Most people struggling with compulsive dating are either **anxiously** or **avoidantly** attached. I'm firmly in the anxious camp.

üîó Google ""4 attachment styles - Cleveland Clinic"" for a good article on this

# ü™û Step 2: Learn Cognitive Distortions & Reframing

Most of us have distorted thought patterns that fuel compulsive behaviors.

* üîó Google ""10 common cognitive distortions therapist aid"" for the simplest list
* üîó Google ""healthline cognitive distortion reframing"" for good info on this

*On a separate comment, I‚Äôll include a massive list of 100 distortions I got from ChatGPT.*

# üìì Step 3: Journal Regularly

I use **Notion** and journal daily (then run my writings through Chat GPT for feedback and to spot trends) using prompts like:

* What cognitive distortions showed up today? How can I reframe them?
* *(If anxiously attached)* Did I feel impatient for connection today? How could I respond differently?
* *(If avoidantly attached)* Did I hide from connection today? Why?
* What was the story of my day (in detail)?
* What am I grateful for (3 things minimum)?
* What am I proud of myself for (3 things minimum)?
* What am I excited (3 things minimum - and try make at least one of them mundane)?
* Add personalized prompts (I have OCD, so I focus on reassurance-seeking and compulsions)

# ‚ù§Ô∏è Step 4: Define What You Want in a Partner

Separate these into:

* **Dealbreakers**: things that must exist or the relationship will end up toxic (for me: emotionally available, not avoidant, 21+, compassionate, employed, politically aligned, religiously aligned, etc.)
* **Preferences**: Ideal but flexible traits (for me: soft personality, no hard drugs, college-educated, shorter than me, etc.)

# ü™û Step 5: Ask Yourself:

**""Is it likely someone who meets my standards would be attracted to me today?""**

If the answer is ""probably not,"" (which it probably is tbh) don‚Äôt spiral ‚Äî just keep working through these steps to identify why not and improve.

# üß© Step 6: Audit Your Life

Ask:

* **What anxieties am I ignoring?** (e.g. money strggules, OCD, etc.)
* **What insecurities weigh on me?** (e.g. BMI 41, anxious in friendships)
* **What patterns are disrupting me?** (e.g. phone addiction, obsessing over dating content)
* **What am I deeply longing for?** (e.g. friendship, career ambition, purpose)

# ‚è∏Ô∏è Step 7: Pause Intentional Pursuit of Dating & Build a ‚ÄúDating Baseline‚Äù

Pause intentional dating until you meet key **baseline goals** ‚Äî not to become avoidant, but to avoid chasing relationships that aren‚Äôt right for you.

**My Ideal Baseline:**

* BMI of 22.5
* 6 months emergency savings
* 10 new local friends
* 3 promotions
* 30 mins meditation daily
* ‚â§ 2 hours screen time
* Daily journaling
* Own a new car

# ‚úÖ Step 8: Make a Realistic Version of Those Goals

We aren't aiming for perfection, we're aiming for **momentum.**

**My Acceptable Baseline:**

* BMI of 30
* 3 new friends
* 1 promotion
* 10 mins meditation
* ‚â§ 4 hours screen time
* 4x/week journaling
* 4 months emergency savings
* Car from 2017‚Äì2022

# üîÅ Step 9: Translate Goals Into Daily Habits

* Walk 10K steps
* Lift 3x/week
* Eat 3 healthy meals
* Attend 2 social events
* Study for career designation
* Meditate 10 mins
* Journal daily
* $350/paycheck to savings, $150 to car

# üß± Step 10: Break Habits Into Smallest Meaningful Units

* Walk 4K steps
* Watch 1 video on lifting form
* Eat 1 healthy meal
* Research 1 event
* Study once
* Meditate 5 mins 3x/week
* Journal 4x/week
* Save $200/paycheck

# üìä Step 11: Build a Habit Tracker

Use Google Sheets or Notion:

* Rows = habits
* Columns = days of week
* Have a column for score (based on how many days you accomplished it), level up (when to up the habit to the next meaningful unit), & a reminder as to why this habit is important to your long-term vision.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Step 12: Tailor Journal Prompts to Your Goals

Example prompts based on my personal introspection:

* How was my relationship with food today?
* When did I feel present today? When did I feel unpresent?
* What‚Äôs one meaningful connection I had today (however small)?
* How was my relationship with my phone today?
* How was my workday? Did I move towards a promotion?
* Was I mindful with how I spent money?

# üÜô Step 13: Level Up Habits Gradually

Each week, increase the challenge slightly if you succeeded the week before (until you reach your ideal habit from step 9‚Ä¶ or even beyond if you want).

Slow, sustainable change > burning out fast.

# üå± Step 14: Reintegration (When Ready)

Once you meet your baseline goals, you can reintegrate dating ‚Äî *intentionally*.

# üß† Step 15: Reintegration Strategy

* Use apps like Hinge/Bumble with intention (premium accounts + good photos)
* Ask friends/family to set you up (especially if they notice your glow-up!)
* Join aligned group events or classes
   * Google ""event matrix"" by Logan Ury for helping picking what to join.  The crux is, pick events where it's highly likely you'll enjoy it, and there will be people you're interested in at.
* At public events (concerts, clubs, meetups), talk to people naturally. Don‚Äôt ‚Äúhit on‚Äù them ‚Äî just connect.

**Simple ask-out line:**

>""I've really enjoyed this conversation.  Would you like to continue it over coffee (or drinks if you're really feeling it) sometime soon?""

# üìå Step 16: Hold Your Standards

Don‚Äôt lower them just to avoid being alone. If you‚Äôve done the work, trust that you deserve someone aligned with your values and efforts.

Let me know if anyone‚Äôs on a similar journey or wants to walk this path together. I'm not trying to sell anything, just want to help others skip some of the trial & error it took to get me to this point.  Journaling and intentional habit tracking saved me from burnout, and I truly think it can help others too.",2,1748107753.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Hi, I'd like to know if you think I'm neurodivergent. I know it doesn't count as a diagnosis. The thing is, I don't know if my experience is as difficult as other people's. I could consider a professional diagnosis later, but there's a stigma attached to the psychiatric ward where I am.

Some traits:

* Sometimes I make dinosaur or T-rex hands, but it's more because I don't know what to do with my hands.

*  I have so much to do that I don't get any of it done (at least yesterday was the case).

* I've gotten to the point of procrastinating badly, not realizing the task was so serious until I see it and analyze it thoroughly.

* When people are talking, I can get distracted by thinking about something recent to analyze, or something they say triggers my planning (but I try to get back to the present and I manage).

* I often imagine myself as a YouTuber in my head, planning videos based on topics that interest me, and the songs I listen to give me ideas. A while back, I was stressed about not recording them, but I think it could be me processing information. I do have plans to make educational content.

* Sometimes I consider myself unsociable. Lately, I feel like I have to think about other people more because I tend to stay inside myself.

* Recently, I identified with a masochistic personality, or one that gives myself to others unnecessarily.

* I like to read things on Wikipedia and learn about topics that interest me.

* ""Mundane"" tasks drive me crazy because they're things that will have to be redone later. Sometimes I get distracted while doing them, and I finish them, but between music and going back and forth.

* It's been hard for me to break away from being focused on reels and short videos.

* I have sometimes forgotten important things, but I don't feel it's that serious.

* It's a big lie that I make a to-do list and do it; I just know what I have to do and I do it.

* I feel like I used to be more productive.

* I feel like I have time, but I don't have time.

* I almost always touch my chin or move my foot when I sit, but I think the coffee might have something to do with it.

I took an autism test and didn't score very high on that one, nor on the ADHD test. I did score on some things, but not as high.

* **Dealbreakers**: things that must exist or the relationship will end up toxic (for me: emotionally available, not avoidant, 21+, compassionate, employed, politically aligned, religiously aligned, etc.)
* **Preferences**: Ideal but flexible traits (for me: soft personality, no hard drugs, college-educated, shorter than me, etc.)

# ü™û Step 5: Ask Yourself:

**""Is it likely someone who meets my standards would be attracted to me today?""**

If the answer is ""probably not,"" (which it probably is tbh) don‚Äôt spiral ‚Äî just keep working through these steps to identify why not and improve.

# üß© Step 6: Audit Your Life

Ask:

* **What anxieties am I ignoring?** (e.g. money strggules, OCD, etc.)
* **What insecurities weigh on me?** (e.g. BMI 41, anxious in friendships)
* **What patterns are disrupting me?** (e.g. phone addiction, obsessing over dating content)
* **What am I deeply longing for?** (e.g. friendship, career ambition, purpose)

# ‚è∏Ô∏è Step 7: Pause Intentional Pursuit of Dating & Build a ‚ÄúDating Baseline‚Äù

Pause intentional dating until you meet key **baseline goals** ‚Äî not to become avoidant, but to avoid chasing relationships that aren‚Äôt right for you.

**My Ideal Baseline:**

* BMI of 22.5
* 6 months emergency savings
* 10 new local friends
* 3 promotions
* 30 mins meditation daily
* ‚â§ 2 hours screen time
* Daily journaling
* Own a new car

# ‚úÖ Step 8: Make a Realistic Version of Those Goals

We aren't aiming for perfection, we're aiming for **momentum.**

**My Acceptable Baseline:**

* BMI of 30
* 3 new friends
* 1 promotion
* 10 mins meditation
* ‚â§ 4 hours screen time
* 4x/week journaling
* 4 months emergency savings
* Car from 2017‚Äì2022

# üîÅ Step 9: Translate Goals Into Daily Habits

* Walk 10K steps
* Lift 3x/week
* Eat 3 healthy meals
* Attend 2 social events
* Study for career designation
* Meditate 10 mins
* Journal daily
* $350/paycheck to savings, $150 to car

# üß± Step 10: Break Habits Into Smallest Meaningful Units

* Walk 4K steps
* Watch 1 video on lifting form
* Eat 1 healthy meal
* Research 1 event
* Study once
* Meditate 5 mins 3x/week
* Journal 4x/week
* Save $200/paycheck

# üìä Step 11: Build a Habit Tracker

Use Google Sheets or Notion:

* Rows = habits
* Columns = days of week
* Have a column for score (based on how many days you accomplished it), level up (when to up the habit to the next meaningful unit), & a reminder as to why this habit is important to your long-term vision.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Step 12: Tailor Journal Prompts to Your Goals

Example prompts based on my personal introspection:

* How was my relationship with food today?
* When did I feel present today? When did I feel unpresent?
* What‚Äôs one meaningful connection I had today (however small)?
* How was my relationship with my phone today?
* How was my workday? Did I move towards a promotion?
* Was I mindful with how I spent money?

# üÜô Step 13: Level Up Habits Gradually

Each week, increase the challenge slightly if you succeeded the week before (until you reach your ideal habit from step 9‚Ä¶ or even beyond if you want).

Slow, sustainable change > burning out fast.

# üå± Step 14: Reintegration (When Ready)

Once you meet your baseline goals, you can reintegrate dating ‚Äî *intentionally*.

# üß† Step 15: Reintegration Strategy

* Use apps like Hinge/Bumble with intention (premium accounts + good photos)
* Ask friends/family to set you up (especially if they notice your glow-up!)
* Join aligned group events or classes
   * Google ""event matrix"" by Logan Ury for helping picking what to join.  The crux is, pick events where it's highly likely you'll enjoy it, and there will be people you're interested in at.
* At public events (concerts, clubs, meetups), talk to people naturally. Don‚Äôt ‚Äúhit on‚Äù them ‚Äî just connect.

**Simple ask-out line:**

>""I've really enjoyed this conversation.  Would you like to continue it over coffee (or drinks if you're really feeling it) sometime soon?""

# üìå Step 16: Hold Your Standards

Don‚Äôt lower them just to avoid being alone. If you‚Äôve done the work, trust that you deserve someone aligned with your values and efforts.

Let me know if anyone‚Äôs on a similar journey or wants to walk this path together. I'm not trying to sell anything, just want to help others skip some of the trial & error it took to get me to this point.  Journaling and intentional habit tracking saved me from burnout, and I truly think it can help others too.",1,1748107700.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False
1kuh0th,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginalCharacter/comments/1kuh0th/my_first_oc_juju/,My first OC: Juju,"[OC] Juju ‚Äì The Veilburned Soul Sorcerer & Traveling Tea Mistress

Race: Human
Class: Sorcerer (Homebrew ‚Äì Veilburned Soul)
Background: Cult Survivor / Entrepreneur
Level: 5
Alignment: Neutral Good (emotionally haunted, but polite about it)


‚ÄúWould you like some tea‚Ä¶ or a doll that remembers your sins?‚Äù

Meet Juju, a soft-spoken and eerily charming sorceress with two goals in life:

1. Run a cozy, traveling tea shop.


2. Not get haunted to death by the literal voodoo dolls made from her past.




---

Appearance

Dark, thoughtful eyes that flicker faintly with arcane energy when casting.

Skin traced with doll-like stitch tattoos and subtle voodoo runes, equal parts mystical and unnerving.

Wears practical traveler‚Äôs gear with a haunted whimsy: earthy tones, tribal beads, and arcane charms.

Carries a weathered artifact pouch of handmade, living dolls that blink, float, and sometimes scream.



---

Backstory

Born under a rare celestial event, Juju was marked from birth by a cursed entropic spirit. Raised in a secretive soul-cult, she was forced to bind her parents‚Äô souls into dolls at age ten‚Äîa trauma that shaped her magic and her guilt.

She escaped as a teen, swearing to use her dark gifts for good. Now she wanders the realm, selling enchanted teas out of her mobile shop:
‚ÄúJuju‚Äôs Doll House‚Äù ‚Äì Tea. Coffee. Curses.‚Äù


---

Personality

Kind, empathetic, and always gently offering tea.

Uses her business as emotional armor and her anchor to normalcy.

Suffers from PTSD but masks it behind hospitality.

Keeps her past secret‚Äîespecially the talking dolls in her pouch.



---

Unique Abilities

Homebrew Sorcerer Subclass ‚Äì Veilburned Soul

Artifact Pouch: Carries a bottomless amounts of materials to make dolls of any shape or size.

Quick Dollwork: Instant-use dolls for explosions and debuffs.

Empowered Dollwork: Reusable dolls as spell foci.

Soulbound Sentinel: A massive protector doll imbued with her own soul (yes, she made a giant bodyguard plushie of herself).

Dark Secret: Her parents‚Äô souls are still bound in the first two dolls she ever made. They whisper to her. Constantly.



---

Signature Teas (Magically Infused)

Moonflower Tranquility ‚Äì Calms the mind and enhances insight.

Whisperleaf Brew ‚Äì Soothes anxiety, grants slight magical calm.

Shadowspice Mocha ‚Äì Adds a playful, minor magical effect. May cause spontaneous illusions or talking mugs.



---

How Others See Her

Locals know her as the soft-spoken tea witch with the best brews and the weirdest dolls. Most just think she‚Äôs eccentric. A few suspect she‚Äôs been through hell. They're right.

But she‚Äôs always kind. Always careful.
And never‚Äîever‚Äîwithout tea.


---

TL;DR
Juju is a haunted soul with a tea cart, a cursed past, and a pouch of living dolls. She‚Äôs sweet, spooky, and just wants to atone‚Äîwith caffeine and arcane fire.


---
A quick explanation of her dolls:

She can make dolls of any shape or size using the materials in her pouch.
The dolls are normally one-time use, but they can be reused when using Empowered Dollwork.
These dolls are for different purposes, ex-
Needle dolls that poke the target with sharp, cursed needles
Explosion dolls that....well explode when they are near the target 
Scout dolls, usually shaped like birds(crude and scary ones), able to fly and telepathically report what they see.
Disease dolls, that go near the target, explode, releasing gases containing deadly diseases. And many more

The sentinel is a hard one to make, as it's human sized, and takes a part of her soul(trust me, it hurts). But it is like a remote controlled version of herself, the doll can cast curses, controll dolls, talk, float, take hit for Juju, however, should it ever get destroyed.....Well Juju gets hurt significantly, physically and spiritually, so she has only made 2 till now, the first exploded and the second is around..... somewhere.

Her buisness is very profitable, especially since the dolls work unpaid, but Juju is still a very good Barista......(She hopes to franchise some day).

Clarification:
I showed this to a friend and they said it was soo similar to a character from the game Brawl Stars....
Yeh OC's name was actually Lei, but I liked the character Juju so much that I decided to use the name, but I didn't use any gimmicks to keep this orginal......
So yeh, if the name lines up with voodoo stuff, yeh I kinda did this.

Hi, I've been dealing with an extended flare up since December 2024. Been experiencing GERD symptoms actively for about 4 years.

Tried rabeprazole 20mg for a three weeks but to little effect during vacation February 2025, and symptoms got better. Came back, got a new gastro, got put on omeprazole 40mg.

It's been weird. Had my symptoms completely gone by the first week of omeprazole 40mg and altered diet, but got lax with diet, and the symptoms came back with a vengeance. Now, over 6 weeks later, still haven't gotten back to no symptoms.

More than that, my symptoms have evolved from:

- chest pressure (the worst, and focused at the bottom of my sternum)
- belching

To now including more of the following:

- shortness of breath (incredibly increased)
- nausea
- hoarse voice in morning and night (mildly hoarse throughout the day)
- sometimes burning or stabbing pain in stomach, intestines

I don't lie down till 3 hours after eating and have a wedge pillow. Don't drink, don't smoke, don't have coffee, don't drink caffeinated tea (mostly chamomile and ginger)

I'm at the end of my rope. Anybody else have experience with new meds, decent diet, and all the right practices but no relief??

TL;DR upped PPI dosage, changed diet, not getting better, symptoms increasing, what now?

Whether you‚Äôve got a tiny balcony or a spacious backyard, gardening is one of the most rewarding hobbies you can pick up. It brings fresh air, fresh food, and fresh peace of mind.

This blog post breaks down **7 practical, foolproof gardening tips** that will help your plants thrive‚Äîwithout the stress.

# üåû 1. Choose the Right Spot

Plants need sunlight like we need coffee. Observe your space throughout the day‚Äîsome plants love full sun (6+ hours), while others prefer shade or partial sun. Start by placing your garden where it‚Äôll get plenty of natural light.

üîç *Tip:* South-facing spaces usually get the most sun.

# üåø 2. Start Small and Easy

Don‚Äôt go full rainforest on Day 1. Begin with a few low-maintenance plants like:

* **Herbs:** Basil, mint, chives
* **Vegetables:** Lettuce, cherry tomatoes, radishes
* **Flowers:** Marigolds, petunias, sunflowers

üåü *Why?* These grow fast, require little fuss, and give satisfying results.

# ü•ï 3. Know Your Soil

Your soil is your plant‚Äôs pantry‚Äîkeep it stocked! Good soil should be well-drained, rich in nutrients, and slightly loose. Consider mixing in **compost or organic matter** to give it a nutrient boost.

üß™ *Pro tip:* Use a simple soil test kit to check pH and fertility.

# üöø 4. Water Wisely

Watering is a skill, not a routine. More plants die from overwatering than underwatering!

üíß General rule: Water deeply but less frequently‚Äîabout 2‚Äì3 times a week depending on climate and soil.

‚òÄÔ∏è *Water early morning or late afternoon* to avoid evaporation.

# üßπ 5. Keep Your Garden Clean

Weeds and dead plants invite pests and disease. Regularly trim, deadhead flowers, and remove fallen leaves. Your plants will thank you with more blooms and healthier growth.

# üìÖ 6. Know When to Plant

Timing matters! Each plant has its season.

üåº Spring: Lettuce, carrots, peas  
‚òÄÔ∏è Summer: Tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers  
üçÅ Fall: Kale, broccoli, spinach

üìÜ Use a planting calendar specific to your region.

# üêû 7. Go Organic When Possible

Avoid harsh chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Instead, use:

* Neem oil for pests
* Compost tea for nutrients
* Ladybugs (yes, really!) for natural pest control

üåç Organic gardening is safer for the environment‚Äîand you!

üåà ***Remember:*** **Every great gardener once killed a plant.**

# Final Thoughts: Your Garden, Your Oasis üå∏üåø

Gardening is more than just planting‚Äîit‚Äôs nurturing life. With a little time, love, and these 10 essential tips, you‚Äôll create a thriving green space that brings you joy every day.

So I'll tell everything shortly, one of my mother's side relative touched me inappropriately when I was like in 1st or 2nd class I still remember that incident in full detail and since then I've never been able to sleep at time or properly, I also got stress and anxiety issues and more than all that I was disgusted of myself for some reason, 

I never told anything about this to anyone except some months before me and my sis were watching a south movie which included a little girl and it kinda have the same story so I asked my sis what she thinks would happen if something like that happens to us and we tell our parents, her first response was maybe they would believe us and I genuinely kinda knew that it's true.


 After that I asked my mother when we were just sitting watching something about the same thing that what would you do if something like that happens to us , she said she'd believe us and take action, then I added what if someone she knew well did that so she was like we'd still take action BUT anyone I know would not do that , I said they would and you still wouldn't believe us she asked me what I meant which I ignored for a while .


 After somedays we were somehow talking about that shit of a person on which I obviously didn't say good stuff about him , so my brother yells at me saying he has done so much for your and us you should be nice to him and mind your language and shi , my mother also agreed so after my brother left I asked her if she really wants to know why I hate that person on which she said yes so I told her everything that happened and how I was so disgusted of myself and all until I realised that it wasn't my fault because I who did nothing am still traumatized about that stuff and the person who did it just casually comes at our home and talks so nicely with anyone like he never did that sick stuff, and guess what my mother says that I understand but he was also young at that time that mf was like 18-19 so I was like that shit was not young and if you think he was young then I was barely born.
She treated me very nicely for some days maybe traumatized or just showing sympathy.


But now after all this time that mf still comes home and my mother tells me to go and greet him and serve him chai/coffee etc and still takes his side on so many things in front of me .

This shit makes me feel sick how could she do that, people treat strangers better than this ...

1kugxsi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kugxsi,Why is this heating element getting burned?,"This is a separated heating element for heat gun for diy coffee roasting project. 
The existing wires were very very thin and I thought they weren't insulted good enough, so for safety reasons I thought I would replace the existing wires with 1.5 sqmm insulated wires. 
Red wire has speciations written as anchor penta  FR 1.5 sqmm 1100v and black has written specifications ""pvs wires and cables 1.5 sqmm 660/1100 volts""
The existing wires were kinda connected with heating coil via copper crimps and were riveted with some sort of copper rivet (?). 
It was impossible for me to replicate that, so I thought I would just cut the wires and solder the new thick wires on top of copper Crimps. 

Upon testing, the heating coil turned orange but also smoke came out and a bit of flame, I immediately disconnected and fortunately flame was small enough that I could put it out by blowing on it. 
After awhile once it cooled down I took the heating element out and as you can see the outer casing as well as inner part seem to have burn marks in the middle. As you can see one wire insulation also got melted

My father thinks that happened because I put it upside down to test and heat went up and burned the wires. But I'm not so sure about that, it shouldn't burn or smoke shouldn't come out, right? 

I went to few local electricians, one of them suggested that my black wire is not fire rated and replacing that will solve the problem. 

I'm skeptical about that too. No local electrician was free enough to help me get it done,

And I'm not sure what's wrong here. 
The soldering is quite tight, why the center person got more burn marks? 
I think i should just buy a new heat gun, with better wires this time, or just buy a heating element replacement if available, seems too costly though, hot airgun was cheaper than replacement part. 

My father still thinks that if there was a blower on the rear and, and the front end wasn't blocked by the floor tile. (I put it upside down to test) there would not be fire. I think i fucked up when i decided to change the wires, original wires wouldn't be a problem as they were properly crimped. My messy soldering is to be blamed.

So Happy Update, As of this time last year I am the proud owner of a GED. 2 years late on the ""estimated HS graduation"" but im told that It's significant that I went back to finish it.

More Recently, aka like all of last night, I managed to get 2 going on 3 bags of trash out of my room, I also plan to clean my blankets today and work on it more over the rest of the weekend. My room was a serious mental block for me for years because of unfinished projects and my things just kept piling up more and more until it became unbearable. And i dont know what happened, I just got tired of it yesterday I guess, It was like something snapped. I got started cleaning and have not been able to stop since. I am running on 5 hours of sleep, 2 large cups of coffee, and sheer spite... with luck, and despite everything else happening this week, I might be able to get it to a manageable enough state by wednesday.",4,1748107262.0,CongratsLikeImFive,0,1.0,False

We originally broke up because I‚Äôm moving away for medical school, and he was clear that he had no interest in doing long distance. It hurt, but I accepted it ‚Äî or at least I tried to. I stayed in contact with him because there was still a chance I could get off the waitlist for a school closer to him, and I guess I thought maybe things could change.

We kept texting, made plans to meet up, and he even took me as his date to his brother‚Äôs wedding. We danced, held hands, kissed ‚Äî it all felt like love again. But soon after, he started pulling away. Slow replies, canceled plans, vague communication. I started feeling like I was the only one putting in effort, and the emotional weight of it all was falling on me.

Eventually, he canceled our last coffee date the night before we were supposed to meet ‚Äî no real explanation, no follow-up. That was my breaking point. I realized we weren‚Äôt friends. Not really. There was too much history, too many unspoken things, and not enough respect.

So I sent a message. I thanked him for taking me to the wedding, told him it had meant a lot. But I also said that I can‚Äôt keep doing this ‚Äî that staying in contact was making it harder for me to let go and move forward. I told him I was hurt by how he handled things, and that even if I get off the waitlist, I need space. That I need to focus on myself now.

He hasn‚Äôt replied. And honestly? That silence says everything. But I feel lighter, because I finally stood up for my own peace instead of waiting for him to care enough to give it to me.

Yes I am heartbroken and yes I am afraid that I‚Äôll never find anyone again but being with myself is better than being alone in a relationship.

So I'll tell everything shortly, one of my mother's side relative touched me inappropriately when I was like in 1st or 2nd class I still remember that incident in full detail and since then I've never been able to sleep at time or properly, I also got stress and anxiety issues and more than all that I was disgusted of myself for some reason, 

I never told anything about this to anyone except some months before me and my sis were watching a south movie which included a little girl and it kinda have the same story so I asked my sis what she thinks would happen if something like that happens to us and we tell our parents, her first response was maybe they would believe us and I genuinely kinda knew that it's true.


 After that I asked my mother when we were just sitting watching something about the same thing that what would you do if something like that happens to us , she said she'd believe us and take action, then I added what if someone she knew well did that so she was like we'd still take action BUT anyone I know would not do that , I said they would and you still wouldn't believe us she asked me what I meant which I ignored for a while .


 After somedays we were somehow talking about that shit of a person on which I obviously didn't say good stuff about him , so my brother yells at me saying he has done so much for your and us you should be nice to him and mind your language and shi , my mother also agreed so after my brother left I asked her if she really wants to know why I hate that person on which she said yes so I told her everything that happened and how I was so disgusted of myself and all until I realised that it wasn't my fault because I who did nothing am still traumatized about that stuff and the person who did it just casually comes at our home and talks so nicely with anyone like he never did that sick stuff, and guess what my mother says that I understand but he was also young at that time that mf was like 18-19 so I was like that shit was not young and if you think he was young then I was barely born.
She treated me very nicely for some days maybe traumatized or just showing sympathy.


But now after all this time that mf still comes home and my mother tells me to go and greet him and serve him chai/coffee etc and still takes his side on so many things in front of me .

This shit makes me feel sick how could she do that, people treat strangers better than this ...

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued ‚Äî but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed.

This isn‚Äôt just another energy pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs something different, and in this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it‚Äôs worth considering.



What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you‚Äôre just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn‚Äôt for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely ‚Äî especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I‚Äôm fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued ‚Äî but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed.

This isn‚Äôt just another energy pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs something different, and in this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it‚Äôs worth considering.



What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you‚Äôre just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn‚Äôt for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely ‚Äî especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I‚Äôm fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.

1kugsj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kugsj8/my_wife_brought_home_a_stray_cat_while_i_was_away/,"My wife brought home a stray cat while I was away. Now I don't recognize her, and I hear IT talking back.","

I returned to my home after an arduous work trip that lasted for three full weeks. My heart ached with longing, a longing that permeated every cell of my being, an overwhelming yearning for my wife, for her laughter that brightens my days, and for the warmth of our home that my soul had grown accustomed to. I turned the key in the door lock; the metal was cold under my fingertips, which trembled slightly from sheer anticipation. I pushed the door open gently, and I was greeted in the hallway by a strange scent, not at all familiar to me, a complex mixture of something faintly earthy, like the aroma of damp soil after a light rain, and a sweet feminine perfume I didn't recognize as one of my wife's usual fragrances. My heart constricted a little, but I attributed it to her perhaps trying a new air freshener or incense. I called out my wife's name, the name I love, and her voice came from the living room, carrying a quiet tone, perhaps quieter than necessary. Moments later, she appeared, a faint smile gracing her face, a smile that couldn't quite reach the sparkle in her eyes, which had dimmed a little. I embraced her tightly, trying to draw some reassurance from her closeness, but I felt a strange coldness in her body, or perhaps it was just my own exhaustion after the weariness of the long journey and the hardship of the road.

""I missed you so much"" I whispered in her ear, burying my face in her hair, from which that new scent emanated.
She replied in a faint voice, barely audible, ""Me too... I missed you."" There was a certain coolness in her voice, something I had never known from her.

Then, from behind her legs, where she stood as if shielding something, an orange-colored creature emerged, with thick, elegant fur. It was a medium-sized cat, lithe in build, but what truly froze the blood in my veins, and made my breath catch, was the look in its eyes. They were wide, a radiant amber color, clear as if they were polished gemstones, staring at me with an unsettling steadiness, with a strange confidence, completely devoid of any familiar feline expression like gentleness or childish curiosity. I felt the power of those gazes, as if they were piercing through the layers of my skin, bypassing my bones, to reach the depths of my soul, exploring its secrets and hidden corners without permission, shamelessly. An unwarranted, cold shiver ran through me, like a light electric current.

""What is this... beautiful creature?"" I asked, trying hard to hide the unease that was beginning to creep into my voice.
My wife smiled a slightly wider smile this time, but it still carried that pale shadow. She bent down gracefully and said in a voice that seemed to carry some pride, ""Oh, this is 'Ginger'. Isn't he lovely? I found him on the doorstep about two weeks ago, on a stormy night. He looked so lonely and miserable, shivering from cold and hunger, so my heart wouldn't let me leave him. I took him in."" She bent further and stroked his head gently. The cat raised its long, bushy tail like an orange flag and began to purr deeply, not like the ordinary purr of cats that resembles the cooing of doves, but deeper and more resonant, not without its own strangeness, as if it came from a chest much larger than a cat's.

At first, I tried not to pay much attention to it. I told myself, over and over, that she must have felt a crushing loneliness during my long absence, and that having a pet in the house might be a comfort to her, a silent companion to fill some of the void I had left. The first few days after my return were somewhat normal, or so I tried to convince myself. We resumed our daily routine, although I noticed with a worried eye that my wife was spending significantly more time with Ginger than was usual with any pet we had previously owned. The cat followed her around the house like her shadow, never leaving her side, sitting at her feet in majestic silence as she cooked in the kitchen, its amber eyes fixed on her every move. At night, it slept at the foot of our bed, curled up like an orange ball, its eyes rarely leaving her sleeping face, as if guarding her from something.

But slowly, very slowly, like the crawl of a snake, I began to notice more profound, and more alarming, changes in my beloved wife's behavior. The vibrant spark that used to radiate from her usual conversation had extinguished, and her resonant laughter, which used to fill the corners of the house with joy and life, had quieted. She became absent-minded much of the time, sitting before me as a body without a soul, as if she were listening intently to something no one else could hear, something echoing in distant spaces. She no longer shared meals with me at the table as we had for years, those precious moments when we would exchange stories about our day. Instead, she increasingly preferred to take her plate and retreat to the living room, with Ginger gracefully winding around her feet or settling possessively in her lap, eating small pieces of her food that she would toss to him from time to time, ignoring my bewildered and questioning glances.

""Is everything alright, my love?"" I asked her one evening, my heart heavy with her oppressive silence, which had become like a wall isolating her from me. I could see sadness etched on her features, but it was a strange sadness, mixed with a kind of resignation.
She slowly lifted her eyes from the cat, which was licking its small pink tongue over its orange paw, and looked at me with a blank gaze for a few moments, a gaze that passed through me as if I were an invisible ghost. Then she said in a voice devoid of any expression, ""Yes, everything is fine. Why do you keep asking such questions?""
I answered her with a pang, ""Because you seem... different. Sad. Did something upset you? Is it because of my long absence? Please, talk to me.""
She shook her head no, with a slow, heavy movement, and returned her gaze to Ginger, as if looking at him provided a solace she couldn't find in anything else. ""No, there's nothing to worry about. I'm just... a little tired these days.""

But I wasn't convinced by her words. There was something deeper, something that went beyond mere fatigue. That cat, Ginger, had an overwhelming presence in the house, a presence that surpassed its small size. Whenever I looked at it, I felt that piercing gaze penetrating me, as if it were reading my thoughts, analyzing my motives, and judging me with a harsh silence. Its meow was not ordinary at all; sometimes it would emit deep, mysterious hums, and at other times strange, sharp, and broken sounds, unlike any cat meow I knew, more like a private language of its own, a language understood only by it and my wife.

One night, I woke up in the dead of night to the sound of a faint whisper, a soft feminine voice seeping from the living room. I got out of bed cautiously, my heart beginning to pound with increasing anxiety. I tiptoed, following the source of the sound until I reached the partially closed living room door. Through the narrow opening, I saw my wife sitting on the sofa in the darkness, barely illuminated by the threads of moonlight filtering through the window. Ginger was nestled in her lap, like a small orange statue. She was talking to it in a low, intimate voice, with words I couldn't initially distinguish. I moved closer, until my nose almost touched the wood of the door, held my breath, and focused all my senses. Finally, I managed to catch some scattered phrases from her strange conversation.

""...Yes, my dear, I understand you perfectly... I know what you want, and what you yearn for... It will be as you wish, don't worry... I will never let you down...""
She was talking to it as if she were answering questions posed by the cat, as if she were receiving orders or instructions from it. I froze in place, and I felt a cold horror creep into my heart, pumping ice into my veins. Who was she talking to? Was she delirious in her sleep while sitting up? Or was the cat...? No, this was impossible, utter madness.

The next day, I tried hard to broach the subject with her very cautiously, fearing I might explode at her or increase her isolation. ""My love,"" I said as we were having breakfast (or rather, I was having breakfast while she stared blankly at her cold cup of coffee), ""I heard you talking last night in the living room. Were you dreaming?""
She looked at me with sudden sharpness, and said in a defensive tone, ""Talking? Who do you think I was talking to?""
""To Ginger,"" I said hesitantly, trying to make my voice sound normal and non-accusatory.
Her eyes narrowed slightly, and a faint, sarcastic smile played on her lips. ""And what's so strange about that? Don't many people talk to their pets? Weren't you doing that yourself with our old dog, Lucky?""
""Yes, of course,"" I replied quickly, ""but it seemed... different. More serious. As if you were having a real conversation, not just cooing at a pet.""

She was silent for a few moments, fiddling with a small spoon in her cup, then she said in a voice closer to a whisper, a voice that seemed to carry a heavy secret, ""Sometimes... I feel like its meow isn't just a meow. I feel like its hums carry words... as if it's whispering things to me that no one else understands."" Then she shook her head quickly, violently, as if to dispel a disturbing thought that had crept into her mind, and said in a tone she tried to make casual, ""Don't mind what I say, maybe I'm just imagining things due to lack of sleep.""

But I couldn't not care. How could I ignore such a disturbing admission? The strangeness of the relationship between her and that cat worsened gradually and alarmingly, like a malignant disease spreading through the body of our relationship. She no longer cared about her appearance as she used to, she who was the epitome of elegance and grace. She neglected her household duties, which she used to take pride in perfecting and loving, and dust began to accumulate in the corners, and the houseplants she used to care for with love had started to wither. Her eyes now held a hollow, dead look, even when she spoke to me on rare occasions. And on the few times she did sit with me, perhaps in an attempt to appease me or dispel my suspicions, she would suddenly furrow her brow, and turn involuntarily towards the cat, which would usually be lurking in some corner of the room, watching us silently, with its piercing amber eyes. She would say in a confused voice things like, ""What? Now? But... I can't at this moment..."" Then she would abruptly fall silent, and look at me with embarrassment, as if she had caught herself, or as if she had divulged a secret she shouldn't have.

The strange smell in the house grew stronger day by day, that damp, earthy smell, which increasingly resembled the scent of freshly opened graves, now mixed with something sickeningly sweet, viscous, that clung to the nose and throat. I tried repeatedly to open the windows for ventilation, to dispel this suffocating miasma, but my wife would rush to close them immediately, with nervous movements, claiming that Ginger felt the cold easily, and that the outside air might disturb him.

It all came to a head, the final straw, one bleak evening. I had returned from work exhausted, carrying the world's worries on my shoulders, all I wished for was some peace and quiet. I entered the house to find her sitting on the floor in the living room, in a strange posture, with Ginger perched in her lap like a small king on his throne. She was feeding it pieces of raw, blood-red meat from her plate, dripping blood, and whispering incomprehensible words to it, a private language between them. She would laugh from time to time, quiet, chilling laughs, laughs that had no joy in them, but were closer to the muffled cackles of someone who had lost their mind. I could no longer bear this surreal, gripping scene.

I approached her, and said in a voice I tried hard to make firm and strong, despite the terror that was wringing my heart, ""Enough! This is enough, woman! Look at yourself! Look at what you've become! This cat... it's affecting you very badly. It's destroying you and destroying our lives!""
She raised her head very slowly, as if she carried the weight of the world on her neck, and looked at me with eyes completely devoid of any human emotion, eyes like windows to an abyss. I felt in that moment that I was looking at a stranger, at a creature I didn't know, a creature that had taken over my wife's body.
""What do you mean by that?"" she asked in a voice as cold as ice, a voice as sharp as a razor.
""I mean Ginger! That little devil!"" I shouted, my patience exhausted. ""Ever since that damned cat entered our house, you've been changing for the worse day by day. You don't eat with me, you don't talk to me like before, you neglect yourself and you neglect our home, which used to be a paradise. It's... it's not normal! This is not just a cat!""
I took a deep breath, trying to gather my courage, and said with finality, ""This cat has to go. I'll take it myself to an animal shelter tomorrow morning, whether you agree or not.""

In that instant, as if my words were the key that unleashed a caged beast, her demeanor transformed before me horrifically. She sprang to her feet with a swift movement, and Ginger fell from her lap quietly, like a piece of silk, but its amber eyes were fixed on me with terrifying concentration, with the focus of a hunter watching its prey. My wife's eyes gleamed with a frightening, animalistic glint, and her facial features hardened into a mask of pure rage, a rage I had never seen on a human face in my life.
""Don't you dare!"" she screamed in a hoarse voice, a strange voice, not the gentle voice I knew and loved. ""Don't you dare touch Ginger! Don't you even think about it!""
""But he's making you sick! He's poison!"" I cried out in desperation, trying to reach any remnant of sanity in her head. ""Can't you see that? You're not well! You need help!""

She suddenly lunged, with a movement I hadn't expected from her, towards the kitchen. For a moment, it crossed my mind that she might be getting a glass of water to calm down, or perhaps she would break down crying. But instead, I heard the sound of sharp metal scraping, the sound of a knife being violently pulled from the kitchen drawer. The blood froze in my veins, and I felt the ground sway beneath me. She returned holding a paring knife, its blade gleaming, waving it in my face with nervous, unsteady movements, as if she couldn't control her hand.
""If you try to take him from me,"" she said, panting, her eyes blazing like burning coals, ""I swear... I swear by his pure soul that I will hurt you. I won't let you! He's all I have!""

The horror that engulfed me in that moment cannot be described in words. This was no longer the wife I knew and loved. This creature standing before me, trembling with rage, threatening me with a knife, was something else, something dark and terrifying, something that had possessed her. I backed away slowly, step by step, raising my hands in a clear gesture of surrender, trying not to provoke her anger further.
""Alright, alright, my love,"" I said in a trembling voice, trying to calm her down, ""Calm down, please. I won't do anything. I won't touch him. Just put the knife down.""

But she didn't calm down. She continued to stare at me with that crazed look, the knife in her hand trembling dangerously. I realized in that moment that I was in real danger, that my life was on the line. I seized a fleeting moment of distraction in her eyes, when she glanced for a second towards the cat, which was sitting perfectly still, watching the scene, and I pushed her with all my might to the side. She stumbled, losing her balance for a moment, and that was my chance. I ran as fast as I could towards the bathroom, slammed the door behind me, and locked it just in time. I heard her furious, hate-filled scream, then the heavy thud of her body against the door, trying to force it open.

My heart was pounding wildly in my chest, like a trapped bird trying to break the bars of its cage, and my breath came in ragged gasps, barely able to draw air into my lungs. My hands trembled as I desperately fumbled for my phone in my pocket. I finally found it, called the police, and explained the situation in a broken, stuttering voice, barely able to string words together from sheer terror. They said they would send a patrol car immediately, and that I should stay calm and not open the door for any reason.

And while I waited, leaning against the cold door, listening to her panting, angry breaths from the other side, I heard her begin to speak. She wasn't talking to me, nor was she screaming or threatening. Her voice had returned to that whispering, intimate tone I had heard her use when talking to the cat in the dead of night.
""...Don't worry, my love... my precious Ginger... I won't let him hurt you or take you away from me... We'll be fine... Just you and me... Together forever...""
She was talking to the cat. That orange, demonic thing that had destroyed our lives.

Then, for the first time in my life, I heard another voice answer her from behind the door. It wasn't a meow, nor was it a hum. It was a thin, high-pitched voice, sharp as a knife's edge, coiling like a snake in the air, a voice utterly inhuman, whispering words in a language I didn't understand, an ancient, dark language, but it filled me with a horror beyond any description, a pure, primal terror. The cat was answering my wife! It was replying to her!

I froze in place, and I felt an icy cold seep into my bones, paralyzing my limbs. This wasn't the worst of it, oh, I wish it had been. For a few moments after that demonic dialogue between my wife and the cat, other footsteps reached my ears from behind the door. They weren't my wife's light steps, whose sound I knew so well. These were heavy, deliberate steps, very long strides, as if a giant creature, with unnaturally long legs, was walking slowly, prowling the hallway. Those steps walked alongside my wife's, and then both sets of footsteps stopped right in front of the bathroom door, where I cowered in fear.

I couldn't take this nightmare anymore. I started screaming, screaming with all my might, pounding on the door with my fists, begging them to go away, to leave me alone. I don't know how much time passed while I was in this state, trapped in this cramped bathroom, listening to that demonic conversation unfolding outside, and to the thud of those heavy, terrifying footsteps pacing the hallway, approaching and retreating. Every cell in my body was screaming in terror, and every nerve in my being yearned for salvation.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of torment, I heard loud, violent knocks on the front door of the house, then the sound of police officers announcing their presence, ordering the door to be opened. In that instant, my wife's whispering voice cut off, and those long footsteps vanished abruptly, as if they had evaporated into thin air. I heard a commotion outside, the sounds of shuffling feet, then my wife's sharp scream as she resisted violently. I waited a little longer, then opened the bathroom door very cautiously, my heart still pounding violently.

The hallway was completely empty, except for some disarray left by my wife's struggle. I saw police officers leading her away. She was in a state of extreme agitation, screaming incomprehensible words, and looking around with wild, unfocused eyes, as if she didn't know where she was or what was happening. She said nothing about the cat. She didn't even look in my direction. They took her, and said they would transfer her to a psychiatric facility for evaluation and treatment.

When things had calmed down a bit, and I had regained some of my composure, I asked one of the officers, my voice still trembling, ""And the cat? Ginger... where is he? Did you find him?""
The officer looked at me with obvious bewilderment, and said calmly, ""Cat? We didn't see any cat, sir. We've searched the entire house, there's no trace of any cat here.""

They didn't find him. Ginger had disappeared just as he had appeared, suddenly and without a trace, as if he had never existed, as if he were merely a figment of my sick imagination.

My wife is now in a psychiatric facility. The doctors say she's suffering from an acute nervous breakdown and auditory and visual hallucinations. They blame me indirectly, saying I left her alone for too long, and that loneliness might have pushed her to the brink of madness. Maybe they're right in part. Maybe I unintentionally neglected her. But I know what I saw and what I heard. I know that this is bigger and deeper than just a nervous breakdown.

I'm writing this now from our home, or what used to be our home. I live here alone, in this desolate silence. I'm desperately trying to get my life back, to piece myself together, but it seems impossible. Every night, when complete silence descends upon the house, and everything is shrouded in darkness, I wake up suddenly. I wake up to the sound of those footsteps. Long, heavy, terrifying footsteps, pacing slowly outside my bedroom door, in the dark hallway. Sometimes they stop right in front of the door, and I feel something standing there, in the darkness, watching me, waiting, breathing quietly, terrifyingly.

The cat is missing, yes, that's what the police say. But I am not alone in this house. I know it's here. That thing that was walking beside my wife, that thing that answered her whispers with a demonic voice, that thing that possesses those long strides. It's here with me.

I don't know what to do. I'm afraid to sleep, because I know I'll wake up to that sound. And I'm afraid to wake up, because I know it's waiting for me. I fear this silence that precedes hearing those footsteps, and I fear the darkness that hides the unimaginable.

Have I gone mad too? Has my wife's illness spread to me? Or is there something, some entity, that has crept into our lives through that orange cat with the piercing amber eyes? I have no answers. All I have is this unending terror, and the echo of those long footsteps that haunt me in the dead of night, reminding me that I am not alone... and I never will be.",4,1748107101.0,creepypasta,2,1.0,False

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I‚Äôd be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn‚Äôt go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.



‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



Doctors told me it was ‚Äújust IBS‚Äù or ‚Äústress-related.‚Äù I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting‚Äîyou name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: ‚ÄúWhat do I have to lose?‚Äù



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking‚Äîmy stomach wasn‚Äôt making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I‚Äôm talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating‚Äîjust relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What‚Äôs Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn‚Äôt crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved‚ÄîI felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here‚Äôs something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected‚Äîand PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn‚Äôt in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat‚Äîwithout changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn‚Äôt holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn‚Äôt some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here‚Äôs what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



‚úÖ Spore-Based Probiotics ‚Äì These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



‚úÖ Clinically Proven Strains ‚Äì These aren‚Äôt just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



‚úÖ No Refrigeration Needed ‚Äì PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it‚Äôs easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



‚úÖ Third-Party Tested ‚Äì You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



‚úÖ Real, Lasting Results ‚Äì Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you ‚Äúfeel fine,‚Äù the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins‚Äîwe ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I‚Äôll Never Go Without It Again

I‚Äôm now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I‚Äôll never go without it again. I‚Äôve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation‚Äîshe‚Äôs now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don‚Äôt work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you‚Äôre even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You‚Äôll know within a week or two that something is changing‚Äîand you‚Äôll never want to go back.



I don‚Äôt say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn‚Äôt just help me poop better‚Äîit gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: ‚ÄúWhat do I have to lose?‚Äù



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking‚Äîmy stomach wasn‚Äôt making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I‚Äôm talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating‚Äîjust relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What‚Äôs Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn‚Äôt crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved‚ÄîI felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here‚Äôs something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected‚Äîand PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn‚Äôt in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat‚Äîwithout changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn‚Äôt holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn‚Äôt some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here‚Äôs what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



‚úÖ Spore-Based Probiotics ‚Äì These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



‚úÖ Clinically Proven Strains ‚Äì These aren‚Äôt just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



‚úÖ No Refrigeration Needed ‚Äì PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it‚Äôs easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



‚úÖ Third-Party Tested ‚Äì You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



‚úÖ Real, Lasting Results ‚Äì Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you ‚Äúfeel fine,‚Äù the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins‚Äîwe ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I‚Äôll Never Go Without It Again

I‚Äôm now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I‚Äôll never go without it again. I‚Äôve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation‚Äîshe‚Äôs now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don‚Äôt work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you‚Äôre even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You‚Äôll know within a week or two that something is changing‚Äîand you‚Äôll never want to go back.



I don‚Äôt say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn‚Äôt just help me poop better‚Äîit gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.



‚ùÑÔ∏èü¶æPublic reviews :



Prime Biome has received a mix of reviews from users worldwide. Many customers have reported positive experiences, particularly regarding skin improvements and digestive health.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, ‚ÄúI would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!‚Äù 

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, ‚ÄúI used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see. No more expensive procedures and thousands of needles in my face for me. It‚Äôs simply unbelievable!‚Äù ",1,1748107065.0,LegalAdviceEU,2,1.0,False

I returned to my home after an arduous work trip that lasted for three full weeks. My heart ached with longing, a longing that permeated every cell of my being, an overwhelming yearning for my wife, for her laughter that brightens my days, and for the warmth of our home that my soul had grown accustomed to. I turned the key in the door lock; the metal was cold under my fingertips, which trembled slightly from sheer anticipation. I pushed the door open gently, and I was greeted in the hallway by a strange scent, not at all familiar to me, a complex mixture of something faintly earthy, like the aroma of damp soil after a light rain, and a sweet feminine perfume I didn't recognize as one of my wife's usual fragrances. My heart constricted a little, but I attributed it to her perhaps trying a new air freshener or incense. I called out my wife's name, the name I love, and her voice came from the living room, carrying a quiet tone, perhaps quieter than necessary. Moments later, she appeared, a faint smile gracing her face, a smile that couldn't quite reach the sparkle in her eyes, which had dimmed a little. I embraced her tightly, trying to draw some reassurance from her closeness, but I felt a strange coldness in her body, or perhaps it was just my own exhaustion after the weariness of the long journey and the hardship of the road.

""I missed you so much"" I whispered in her ear, burying my face in her hair, from which that new scent emanated.
She replied in a faint voice, barely audible, ""Me too... I missed you."" There was a certain coolness in her voice, something I had never known from her.

Then, from behind her legs, where she stood as if shielding something, an orange-colored creature emerged, with thick, elegant fur. It was a medium-sized cat, lithe in build, but what truly froze the blood in my veins, and made my breath catch, was the look in its eyes. They were wide, a radiant amber color, clear as if they were polished gemstones, staring at me with an unsettling steadiness, with a strange confidence, completely devoid of any familiar feline expression like gentleness or childish curiosity. I felt the power of those gazes, as if they were piercing through the layers of my skin, bypassing my bones, to reach the depths of my soul, exploring its secrets and hidden corners without permission, shamelessly. An unwarranted, cold shiver ran through me, like a light electric current.

""What is this... beautiful creature?"" I asked, trying hard to hide the unease that was beginning to creep into my voice.
My wife smiled a slightly wider smile this time, but it still carried that pale shadow. She bent down gracefully and said in a voice that seemed to carry some pride, ""Oh, this is 'Ginger'. Isn't he lovely? I found him on the doorstep about two weeks ago, on a stormy night. He looked so lonely and miserable, shivering from cold and hunger, so my heart wouldn't let me leave him. I took him in."" She bent further and stroked his head gently. The cat raised its long, bushy tail like an orange flag and began to purr deeply, not like the ordinary purr of cats that resembles the cooing of doves, but deeper and more resonant, not without its own strangeness, as if it came from a chest much larger than a cat's.

At first, I tried not to pay much attention to it. I told myself, over and over, that she must have felt a crushing loneliness during my long absence, and that having a pet in the house might be a comfort to her, a silent companion to fill some of the void I had left. The first few days after my return were somewhat normal, or so I tried to convince myself. We resumed our daily routine, although I noticed with a worried eye that my wife was spending significantly more time with Ginger than was usual with any pet we had previously owned. The cat followed her around the house like her shadow, never leaving her side, sitting at her feet in majestic silence as she cooked in the kitchen, its amber eyes fixed on her every move. At night, it slept at the foot of our bed, curled up like an orange ball, its eyes rarely leaving her sleeping face, as if guarding her from something.

But slowly, very slowly, like the crawl of a snake, I began to notice more profound, and more alarming, changes in my beloved wife's behavior. The vibrant spark that used to radiate from her usual conversation had extinguished, and her resonant laughter, which used to fill the corners of the house with joy and life, had quieted. She became absent-minded much of the time, sitting before me as a body without a soul, as if she were listening intently to something no one else could hear, something echoing in distant spaces. She no longer shared meals with me at the table as we had for years, those precious moments when we would exchange stories about our day. Instead, she increasingly preferred to take her plate and retreat to the living room, with Ginger gracefully winding around her feet or settling possessively in her lap, eating small pieces of her food that she would toss to him from time to time, ignoring my bewildered and questioning glances.

""Is everything alright, my love?"" I asked her one evening, my heart heavy with her oppressive silence, which had become like a wall isolating her from me. I could see sadness etched on her features, but it was a strange sadness, mixed with a kind of resignation.
She slowly lifted her eyes from the cat, which was licking its small pink tongue over its orange paw, and looked at me with a blank gaze for a few moments, a gaze that passed through me as if I were an invisible ghost. Then she said in a voice devoid of any expression, ""Yes, everything is fine. Why do you keep asking such questions?""
I answered her with a pang, ""Because you seem... different. Sad. Did something upset you? Is it because of my long absence? Please, talk to me.""
She shook her head no, with a slow, heavy movement, and returned her gaze to Ginger, as if looking at him provided a solace she couldn't find in anything else. ""No, there's nothing to worry about. I'm just... a little tired these days.""

But I wasn't convinced by her words. There was something deeper, something that went beyond mere fatigue. That cat, Ginger, had an overwhelming presence in the house, a presence that surpassed its small size. Whenever I looked at it, I felt that piercing gaze penetrating me, as if it were reading my thoughts, analyzing my motives, and judging me with a harsh silence. Its meow was not ordinary at all; sometimes it would emit deep, mysterious hums, and at other times strange, sharp, and broken sounds, unlike any cat meow I knew, more like a private language of its own, a language understood only by it and my wife.

One night, I woke up in the dead of night to the sound of a faint whisper, a soft feminine voice seeping from the living room. I got out of bed cautiously, my heart beginning to pound with increasing anxiety. I tiptoed, following the source of the sound until I reached the partially closed living room door. Through the narrow opening, I saw my wife sitting on the sofa in the darkness, barely illuminated by the threads of moonlight filtering through the window. Ginger was nestled in her lap, like a small orange statue. She was talking to it in a low, intimate voice, with words I couldn't initially distinguish. I moved closer, until my nose almost touched the wood of the door, held my breath, and focused all my senses. Finally, I managed to catch some scattered phrases from her strange conversation.

""...Yes, my dear, I understand you perfectly... I know what you want, and what you yearn for... It will be as you wish, don't worry... I will never let you down...""
She was talking to it as if she were answering questions posed by the cat, as if she were receiving orders or instructions from it. I froze in place, and I felt a cold horror creep into my heart, pumping ice into my veins. Who was she talking to? Was she delirious in her sleep while sitting up? Or was the cat...? No, this was impossible, utter madness.

The next day, I tried hard to broach the subject with her very cautiously, fearing I might explode at her or increase her isolation. ""My love,"" I said as we were having breakfast (or rather, I was having breakfast while she stared blankly at her cold cup of coffee), ""I heard you talking last night in the living room. Were you dreaming?""
She looked at me with sudden sharpness, and said in a defensive tone, ""Talking? Who do you think I was talking to?""
""To Ginger,"" I said hesitantly, trying to make my voice sound normal and non-accusatory.
Her eyes narrowed slightly, and a faint, sarcastic smile played on her lips. ""And what's so strange about that? Don't many people talk to their pets? Weren't you doing that yourself with our old dog, Lucky?""
""Yes, of course,"" I replied quickly, ""but it seemed... different. More serious. As if you were having a real conversation, not just cooing at a pet.""

She was silent for a few moments, fiddling with a small spoon in her cup, then she said in a voice closer to a whisper, a voice that seemed to carry a heavy secret, ""Sometimes... I feel like its meow isn't just a meow. I feel like its hums carry words... as if it's whispering things to me that no one else understands."" Then she shook her head quickly, violently, as if to dispel a disturbing thought that had crept into her mind, and said in a tone she tried to make casual, ""Don't mind what I say, maybe I'm just imagining things due to lack of sleep.""

But I couldn't not care. How could I ignore such a disturbing admission? The strangeness of the relationship between her and that cat worsened gradually and alarmingly, like a malignant disease spreading through the body of our relationship. She no longer cared about her appearance as she used to, she who was the epitome of elegance and grace. She neglected her household duties, which she used to take pride in perfecting and loving, and dust began to accumulate in the corners, and the houseplants she used to care for with love had started to wither. Her eyes now held a hollow, dead look, even when she spoke to me on rare occasions. And on the few times she did sit with me, perhaps in an attempt to appease me or dispel my suspicions, she would suddenly furrow her brow, and turn involuntarily towards the cat, which would usually be lurking in some corner of the room, watching us silently, with its piercing amber eyes. She would say in a confused voice things like, ""What? Now? But... I can't at this moment..."" Then she would abruptly fall silent, and look at me with embarrassment, as if she had caught herself, or as if she had divulged a secret she shouldn't have.

The strange smell in the house grew stronger day by day, that damp, earthy smell, which increasingly resembled the scent of freshly opened graves, now mixed with something sickeningly sweet, viscous, that clung to the nose and throat. I tried repeatedly to open the windows for ventilation, to dispel this suffocating miasma, but my wife would rush to close them immediately, with nervous movements, claiming that Ginger felt the cold easily, and that the outside air might disturb him.

It all came to a head, the final straw, one bleak evening. I had returned from work exhausted, carrying the world's worries on my shoulders, all I wished for was some peace and quiet. I entered the house to find her sitting on the floor in the living room, in a strange posture, with Ginger perched in her lap like a small king on his throne. She was feeding it pieces of raw, blood-red meat from her plate, dripping blood, and whispering incomprehensible words to it, a private language between them. She would laugh from time to time, quiet, chilling laughs, laughs that had no joy in them, but were closer to the muffled cackles of someone who had lost their mind. I could no longer bear this surreal, gripping scene.

I approached her, and said in a voice I tried hard to make firm and strong, despite the terror that was wringing my heart, ""Enough! This is enough, woman! Look at yourself! Look at what you've become! This cat... it's affecting you very badly. It's destroying you and destroying our lives!""
She raised her head very slowly, as if she carried the weight of the world on her neck, and looked at me with eyes completely devoid of any human emotion, eyes like windows to an abyss. I felt in that moment that I was looking at a stranger, at a creature I didn't know, a creature that had taken over my wife's body.
""What do you mean by that?"" she asked in a voice as cold as ice, a voice as sharp as a razor.
""I mean Ginger! That little devil!"" I shouted, my patience exhausted. ""Ever since that damned cat entered our house, you've been changing for the worse day by day. You don't eat with me, you don't talk to me like before, you neglect yourself and you neglect our home, which used to be a paradise. It's... it's not normal! This is not just a cat!""
I took a deep breath, trying to gather my courage, and said with finality, ""This cat has to go. I'll take it myself to an animal shelter tomorrow morning, whether you agree or not.""

In that instant, as if my words were the key that unleashed a caged beast, her demeanor transformed before me horrifically. She sprang to her feet with a swift movement, and Ginger fell from her lap quietly, like a piece of silk, but its amber eyes were fixed on me with terrifying concentration, with the focus of a hunter watching its prey. My wife's eyes gleamed with a frightening, animalistic glint, and her facial features hardened into a mask of pure rage, a rage I had never seen on a human face in my life.
""Don't you dare!"" she screamed in a hoarse voice, a strange voice, not the gentle voice I knew and loved. ""Don't you dare touch Ginger! Don't you even think about it!""
""But he's making you sick! He's poison!"" I cried out in desperation, trying to reach any remnant of sanity in her head. ""Can't you see that? You're not well! You need help!""

She suddenly lunged, with a movement I hadn't expected from her, towards the kitchen. For a moment, it crossed my mind that she might be getting a glass of water to calm down, or perhaps she would break down crying. But instead, I heard the sound of sharp metal scraping, the sound of a knife being violently pulled from the kitchen drawer. The blood froze in my veins, and I felt the ground sway beneath me. She returned holding a paring knife, its blade gleaming, waving it in my face with nervous, unsteady movements, as if she couldn't control her hand.
""If you try to take him from me,"" she said, panting, her eyes blazing like burning coals, ""I swear... I swear by his pure soul that I will hurt you. I won't let you! He's all I have!""

The horror that engulfed me in that moment cannot be described in words. This was no longer the wife I knew and loved. This creature standing before me, trembling with rage, threatening me with a knife, was something else, something dark and terrifying, something that had possessed her. I backed away slowly, step by step, raising my hands in a clear gesture of surrender, trying not to provoke her anger further.
""Alright, alright, my love,"" I said in a trembling voice, trying to calm her down, ""Calm down, please. I won't do anything. I won't touch him. Just put the knife down.""

But she didn't calm down. She continued to stare at me with that crazed look, the knife in her hand trembling dangerously. I realized in that moment that I was in real danger, that my life was on the line. I seized a fleeting moment of distraction in her eyes, when she glanced for a second towards the cat, which was sitting perfectly still, watching the scene, and I pushed her with all my might to the side. She stumbled, losing her balance for a moment, and that was my chance. I ran as fast as I could towards the bathroom, slammed the door behind me, and locked it just in time. I heard her furious, hate-filled scream, then the heavy thud of her body against the door, trying to force it open.

My heart was pounding wildly in my chest, like a trapped bird trying to break the bars of its cage, and my breath came in ragged gasps, barely able to draw air into my lungs. My hands trembled as I desperately fumbled for my phone in my pocket. I finally found it, called the police, and explained the situation in a broken, stuttering voice, barely able to string words together from sheer terror. They said they would send a patrol car immediately, and that I should stay calm and not open the door for any reason.

And while I waited, leaning against the cold door, listening to her panting, angry breaths from the other side, I heard her begin to speak. She wasn't talking to me, nor was she screaming or threatening. Her voice had returned to that whispering, intimate tone I had heard her use when talking to the cat in the dead of night.
""...Don't worry, my love... my precious Ginger... I won't let him hurt you or take you away from me... We'll be fine... Just you and me... Together forever...""
She was talking to the cat. That orange, demonic thing that had destroyed our lives.

Then, for the first time in my life, I heard another voice answer her from behind the door. It wasn't a meow, nor was it a hum. It was a thin, high-pitched voice, sharp as a knife's edge, coiling like a snake in the air, a voice utterly inhuman, whispering words in a language I didn't understand, an ancient, dark language, but it filled me with a horror beyond any description, a pure, primal terror. The cat was answering my wife! It was replying to her!

I froze in place, and I felt an icy cold seep into my bones, paralyzing my limbs. This wasn't the worst of it, oh, I wish it had been. For a few moments after that demonic dialogue between my wife and the cat, other footsteps reached my ears from behind the door. They weren't my wife's light steps, whose sound I knew so well. These were heavy, deliberate steps, very long strides, as if a giant creature, with unnaturally long legs, was walking slowly, prowling the hallway. Those steps walked alongside my wife's, and then both sets of footsteps stopped right in front of the bathroom door, where I cowered in fear.

I couldn't take this nightmare anymore. I started screaming, screaming with all my might, pounding on the door with my fists, begging them to go away, to leave me alone. I don't know how much time passed while I was in this state, trapped in this cramped bathroom, listening to that demonic conversation unfolding outside, and to the thud of those heavy, terrifying footsteps pacing the hallway, approaching and retreating. Every cell in my body was screaming in terror, and every nerve in my being yearned for salvation.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of torment, I heard loud, violent knocks on the front door of the house, then the sound of police officers announcing their presence, ordering the door to be opened. In that instant, my wife's whispering voice cut off, and those long footsteps vanished abruptly, as if they had evaporated into thin air. I heard a commotion outside, the sounds of shuffling feet, then my wife's sharp scream as she resisted violently. I waited a little longer, then opened the bathroom door very cautiously, my heart still pounding violently.

The hallway was completely empty, except for some disarray left by my wife's struggle. I saw police officers leading her away. She was in a state of extreme agitation, screaming incomprehensible words, and looking around with wild, unfocused eyes, as if she didn't know where she was or what was happening. She said nothing about the cat. She didn't even look in my direction. They took her, and said they would transfer her to a psychiatric facility for evaluation and treatment.

When things had calmed down a bit, and I had regained some of my composure, I asked one of the officers, my voice still trembling, ""And the cat? Ginger... where is he? Did you find him?""
The officer looked at me with obvious bewilderment, and said calmly, ""Cat? We didn't see any cat, sir. We've searched the entire house, there's no trace of any cat here.""

They didn't find him. Ginger had disappeared just as he had appeared, suddenly and without a trace, as if he had never existed, as if he were merely a figment of my sick imagination.

My wife is now in a psychiatric facility. The doctors say she's suffering from an acute nervous breakdown and auditory and visual hallucinations. They blame me indirectly, saying I left her alone for too long, and that loneliness might have pushed her to the brink of madness. Maybe they're right in part. Maybe I unintentionally neglected her. But I know what I saw and what I heard. I know that this is bigger and deeper than just a nervous breakdown.

I'm writing this now from our home, or what used to be our home. I live here alone, in this desolate silence. I'm desperately trying to get my life back, to piece myself together, but it seems impossible. Every night, when complete silence descends upon the house, and everything is shrouded in darkness, I wake up suddenly. I wake up to the sound of those footsteps. Long, heavy, terrifying footsteps, pacing slowly outside my bedroom door, in the dark hallway. Sometimes they stop right in front of the door, and I feel something standing there, in the darkness, watching me, waiting, breathing quietly, terrifyingly.

The cat is missing, yes, that's what the police say. But I am not alone in this house. I know it's here. That thing that was walking beside my wife, that thing that answered her whispers with a demonic voice, that thing that possesses those long strides. It's here with me.

I don't know what to do. I'm afraid to sleep, because I know I'll wake up to that sound. And I'm afraid to wake up, because I know it's waiting for me. I fear this silence that precedes hearing those footsteps, and I fear the darkness that hides the unimaginable.

Have I gone mad too? Has my wife's illness spread to me? Or is there something, some entity, that has crept into our lives through that orange cat with the piercing amber eyes? I have no answers. All I have is this unending terror, and the echo of those long footsteps that haunt me in the dead of night, reminding me that I am not alone... and I never will be.",13,1748107060.0,stories,6,0.81,False

""Is everything alright, my love?"" I asked her one evening, my heart heavy with her oppressive silence, which had become like a wall isolating her from me. I could see sadness etched on her features, but it was a strange sadness, mixed with a kind of resignation.
She slowly lifted her eyes from the cat, which was licking its small pink tongue over its orange paw, and looked at me with a blank gaze for a few moments, a gaze that passed through me as if I were an invisible ghost. Then she said in a voice devoid of any expression, ""Yes, everything is fine. Why do you keep asking such questions?""
I answered her with a pang, ""Because you seem... different. Sad. Did something upset you? Is it because of my long absence? Please, talk to me.""
She shook her head no, with a slow, heavy movement, and returned her gaze to Ginger, as if looking at him provided a solace she couldn't find in anything else. ""No, there's nothing to worry about. I'm just... a little tired these days.""

But I wasn't convinced by her words. There was something deeper, something that went beyond mere fatigue. That cat, Ginger, had an overwhelming presence in the house, a presence that surpassed its small size. Whenever I looked at it, I felt that piercing gaze penetrating me, as if it were reading my thoughts, analyzing my motives, and judging me with a harsh silence. Its meow was not ordinary at all; sometimes it would emit deep, mysterious hums, and at other times strange, sharp, and broken sounds, unlike any cat meow I knew, more like a private language of its own, a language understood only by it and my wife.

One night, I woke up in the dead of night to the sound of a faint whisper, a soft feminine voice seeping from the living room. I got out of bed cautiously, my heart beginning to pound with increasing anxiety. I tiptoed, following the source of the sound until I reached the partially closed living room door. Through the narrow opening, I saw my wife sitting on the sofa in the darkness, barely illuminated by the threads of moonlight filtering through the window. Ginger was nestled in her lap, like a small orange statue. She was talking to it in a low, intimate voice, with words I couldn't initially distinguish. I moved closer, until my nose almost touched the wood of the door, held my breath, and focused all my senses. Finally, I managed to catch some scattered phrases from her strange conversation.

""...Yes, my dear, I understand you perfectly... I know what you want, and what you yearn for... It will be as you wish, don't worry... I will never let you down...""
She was talking to it as if she were answering questions posed by the cat, as if she were receiving orders or instructions from it. I froze in place, and I felt a cold horror creep into my heart, pumping ice into my veins. Who was she talking to? Was she delirious in her sleep while sitting up? Or was the cat...? No, this was impossible, utter madness.

The next day, I tried hard to broach the subject with her very cautiously, fearing I might explode at her or increase her isolation. ""My love,"" I said as we were having breakfast (or rather, I was having breakfast while she stared blankly at her cold cup of coffee), ""I heard you talking last night in the living room. Were you dreaming?""
She looked at me with sudden sharpness, and said in a defensive tone, ""Talking? Who do you think I was talking to?""
""To Ginger,"" I said hesitantly, trying to make my voice sound normal and non-accusatory.
Her eyes narrowed slightly, and a faint, sarcastic smile played on her lips. ""And what's so strange about that? Don't many people talk to their pets? Weren't you doing that yourself with our old dog, Lucky?""
""Yes, of course,"" I replied quickly, ""but it seemed... different. More serious. As if you were having a real conversation, not just cooing at a pet.""

She was silent for a few moments, fiddling with a small spoon in her cup, then she said in a voice closer to a whisper, a voice that seemed to carry a heavy secret, ""Sometimes... I feel like its meow isn't just a meow. I feel like its hums carry words... as if it's whispering things to me that no one else understands."" Then she shook her head quickly, violently, as if to dispel a disturbing thought that had crept into her mind, and said in a tone she tried to make casual, ""Don't mind what I say, maybe I'm just imagining things due to lack of sleep.""

But I couldn't not care. How could I ignore such a disturbing admission? The strangeness of the relationship between her and that cat worsened gradually and alarmingly, like a malignant disease spreading through the body of our relationship. She no longer cared about her appearance as she used to, she who was the epitome of elegance and grace. She neglected her household duties, which she used to take pride in perfecting and loving, and dust began to accumulate in the corners, and the houseplants she used to care for with love had started to wither. Her eyes now held a hollow, dead look, even when she spoke to me on rare occasions. And on the few times she did sit with me, perhaps in an attempt to appease me or dispel my suspicions, she would suddenly furrow her brow, and turn involuntarily towards the cat, which would usually be lurking in some corner of the room, watching us silently, with its piercing amber eyes. She would say in a confused voice things like, ""What? Now? But... I can't at this moment..."" Then she would abruptly fall silent, and look at me with embarrassment, as if she had caught herself, or as if she had divulged a secret she shouldn't have.

The strange smell in the house grew stronger day by day, that damp, earthy smell, which increasingly resembled the scent of freshly opened graves, now mixed with something sickeningly sweet, viscous, that clung to the nose and throat. I tried repeatedly to open the windows for ventilation, to dispel this suffocating miasma, but my wife would rush to close them immediately, with nervous movements, claiming that Ginger felt the cold easily, and that the outside air might disturb him.

It all came to a head, the final straw, one bleak evening. I had returned from work exhausted, carrying the world's worries on my shoulders, all I wished for was some peace and quiet. I entered the house to find her sitting on the floor in the living room, in a strange posture, with Ginger perched in her lap like a small king on his throne. She was feeding it pieces of raw, blood-red meat from her plate, dripping blood, and whispering incomprehensible words to it, a private language between them. She would laugh from time to time, quiet, chilling laughs, laughs that had no joy in them, but were closer to the muffled cackles of someone who had lost their mind. I could no longer bear this surreal, gripping scene.

I approached her, and said in a voice I tried hard to make firm and strong, despite the terror that was wringing my heart, ""Enough! This is enough, woman! Look at yourself! Look at what you've become! This cat... it's affecting you very badly. It's destroying you and destroying our lives!""
She raised her head very slowly, as if she carried the weight of the world on her neck, and looked at me with eyes completely devoid of any human emotion, eyes like windows to an abyss. I felt in that moment that I was looking at a stranger, at a creature I didn't know, a creature that had taken over my wife's body.
""What do you mean by that?"" she asked in a voice as cold as ice, a voice as sharp as a razor.
""I mean Ginger! That little devil!"" I shouted, my patience exhausted. ""Ever since that damned cat entered our house, you've been changing for the worse day by day. You don't eat with me, you don't talk to me like before, you neglect yourself and you neglect our home, which used to be a paradise. It's... it's not normal! This is not just a cat!""
I took a deep breath, trying to gather my courage, and said with finality, ""This cat has to go. I'll take it myself to an animal shelter tomorrow morning, whether you agree or not.""

In that instant, as if my words were the key that unleashed a caged beast, her demeanor transformed before me horrifically. She sprang to her feet with a swift movement, and Ginger fell from her lap quietly, like a piece of silk, but its amber eyes were fixed on me with terrifying concentration, with the focus of a hunter watching its prey. My wife's eyes gleamed with a frightening, animalistic glint, and her facial features hardened into a mask of pure rage, a rage I had never seen on a human face in my life.
""Don't you dare!"" she screamed in a hoarse voice, a strange voice, not the gentle voice I knew and loved. ""Don't you dare touch Ginger! Don't you even think about it!""
""But he's making you sick! He's poison!"" I cried out in desperation, trying to reach any remnant of sanity in her head. ""Can't you see that? You're not well! You need help!""

She suddenly lunged, with a movement I hadn't expected from her, towards the kitchen. For a moment, it crossed my mind that she might be getting a glass of water to calm down, or perhaps she would break down crying. But instead, I heard the sound of sharp metal scraping, the sound of a knife being violently pulled from the kitchen drawer. The blood froze in my veins, and I felt the ground sway beneath me. She returned holding a paring knife, its blade gleaming, waving it in my face with nervous, unsteady movements, as if she couldn't control her hand.
""If you try to take him from me,"" she said, panting, her eyes blazing like burning coals, ""I swear... I swear by his pure soul that I will hurt you. I won't let you! He's all I have!""

The horror that engulfed me in that moment cannot be described in words. This was no longer the wife I knew and loved. This creature standing before me, trembling with rage, threatening me with a knife, was something else, something dark and terrifying, something that had possessed her. I backed away slowly, step by step, raising my hands in a clear gesture of surrender, trying not to provoke her anger further.
""Alright, alright, my love,"" I said in a trembling voice, trying to calm her down, ""Calm down, please. I won't do anything. I won't touch him. Just put the knife down.""

But she didn't calm down. She continued to stare at me with that crazed look, the knife in her hand trembling dangerously. I realized in that moment that I was in real danger, that my life was on the line. I seized a fleeting moment of distraction in her eyes, when she glanced for a second towards the cat, which was sitting perfectly still, watching the scene, and I pushed her with all my might to the side. She stumbled, losing her balance for a moment, and that was my chance. I ran as fast as I could towards the bathroom, slammed the door behind me, and locked it just in time. I heard her furious, hate-filled scream, then the heavy thud of her body against the door, trying to force it open.

My heart was pounding wildly in my chest, like a trapped bird trying to break the bars of its cage, and my breath came in ragged gasps, barely able to draw air into my lungs. My hands trembled as I desperately fumbled for my phone in my pocket. I finally found it, called the police, and explained the situation in a broken, stuttering voice, barely able to string words together from sheer terror. They said they would send a patrol car immediately, and that I should stay calm and not open the door for any reason.

And while I waited, leaning against the cold door, listening to her panting, angry breaths from the other side, I heard her begin to speak. She wasn't talking to me, nor was she screaming or threatening. Her voice had returned to that whispering, intimate tone I had heard her use when talking to the cat in the dead of night.
""...Don't worry, my love... my precious Ginger... I won't let him hurt you or take you away from me... We'll be fine... Just you and me... Together forever...""
She was talking to the cat. That orange, demonic thing that had destroyed our lives.

Then, for the first time in my life, I heard another voice answer her from behind the door. It wasn't a meow, nor was it a hum. It was a thin, high-pitched voice, sharp as a knife's edge, coiling like a snake in the air, a voice utterly inhuman, whispering words in a language I didn't understand, an ancient, dark language, but it filled me with a horror beyond any description, a pure, primal terror. The cat was answering my wife! It was replying to her!

I froze in place, and I felt an icy cold seep into my bones, paralyzing my limbs. This wasn't the worst of it, oh, I wish it had been. For a few moments after that demonic dialogue between my wife and the cat, other footsteps reached my ears from behind the door. They weren't my wife's light steps, whose sound I knew so well. These were heavy, deliberate steps, very long strides, as if a giant creature, with unnaturally long legs, was walking slowly, prowling the hallway. Those steps walked alongside my wife's, and then both sets of footsteps stopped right in front of the bathroom door, where I cowered in fear.

I couldn't take this nightmare anymore. I started screaming, screaming with all my might, pounding on the door with my fists, begging them to go away, to leave me alone. I don't know how much time passed while I was in this state, trapped in this cramped bathroom, listening to that demonic conversation unfolding outside, and to the thud of those heavy, terrifying footsteps pacing the hallway, approaching and retreating. Every cell in my body was screaming in terror, and every nerve in my being yearned for salvation.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of torment, I heard loud, violent knocks on the front door of the house, then the sound of police officers announcing their presence, ordering the door to be opened. In that instant, my wife's whispering voice cut off, and those long footsteps vanished abruptly, as if they had evaporated into thin air. I heard a commotion outside, the sounds of shuffling feet, then my wife's sharp scream as she resisted violently. I waited a little longer, then opened the bathroom door very cautiously, my heart still pounding violently.

The hallway was completely empty, except for some disarray left by my wife's struggle. I saw police officers leading her away. She was in a state of extreme agitation, screaming incomprehensible words, and looking around with wild, unfocused eyes, as if she didn't know where she was or what was happening. She said nothing about the cat. She didn't even look in my direction. They took her, and said they would transfer her to a psychiatric facility for evaluation and treatment.

When things had calmed down a bit, and I had regained some of my composure, I asked one of the officers, my voice still trembling, ""And the cat? Ginger... where is he? Did you find him?""
The officer looked at me with obvious bewilderment, and said calmly, ""Cat? We didn't see any cat, sir. We've searched the entire house, there's no trace of any cat here.""

They didn't find him. Ginger had disappeared just as he had appeared, suddenly and without a trace, as if he had never existed, as if he were merely a figment of my sick imagination.

My wife is now in a psychiatric facility. The doctors say she's suffering from an acute nervous breakdown and auditory and visual hallucinations. They blame me indirectly, saying I left her alone for too long, and that loneliness might have pushed her to the brink of madness. Maybe they're right in part. Maybe I unintentionally neglected her. But I know what I saw and what I heard. I know that this is bigger and deeper than just a nervous breakdown.

I'm writing this now from our home, or what used to be our home. I live here alone, in this desolate silence. I'm desperately trying to get my life back, to piece myself together, but it seems impossible. Every night, when complete silence descends upon the house, and everything is shrouded in darkness, I wake up suddenly. I wake up to the sound of those footsteps. Long, heavy, terrifying footsteps, pacing slowly outside my bedroom door, in the dark hallway. Sometimes they stop right in front of the door, and I feel something standing there, in the darkness, watching me, waiting, breathing quietly, terrifyingly.

The cat is missing, yes, that's what the police say. But I am not alone in this house. I know it's here. That thing that was walking beside my wife, that thing that answered her whispers with a demonic voice, that thing that possesses those long strides. It's here with me.

I don't know what to do. I'm afraid to sleep, because I know I'll wake up to that sound. And I'm afraid to wake up, because I know it's waiting for me. I fear this silence that precedes hearing those footsteps, and I fear the darkness that hides the unimaginable.

Have I gone mad too? Has my wife's illness spread to me? Or is there something, some entity, that has crept into our lives through that orange cat with the piercing amber eyes? I have no answers. All I have is this unending terror, and the echo of those long footsteps that haunt me in the dead of night, reminding me that I am not alone... and I never will be.",4,1748107028.0,nosleep,0,0.83,False

I never told anything about this to anyone except some months before me and my sis were watching a south movie which included a little girl and it kinda have the same story so I asked my sis what she thinks would happen if something like that happens to us and we tell our parents, her first response was maybe they would believe us and I genuinely kinda knew that it's true.


 After that I asked my mother when we were just sitting watching something about the same thing that what would you do if something like that happens to us , she said she'd believe us and take action, then I added what if someone she knew well did that so she was like we'd still take action BUT anyone I know would not do that , I said they would and you still wouldn't believe us she asked me what I meant which I ignored for a while .


 After somedays we were somehow talking about that shit of a person on which I obviously didn't say good stuff about him , so my brother yells at me saying he has done so much for your and us you should be nice to him and mind your language and shi , my mother also agreed so after my brother left I asked her if she really wants to know why I hate that person on which she said yes so I told her everything that happened and how I was so disgusted of myself and all until I realised that it wasn't my fault because I who did nothing am still traumatized about that stuff and the person who did it just casually comes at our home and talks so nicely with anyone like he never did that sick stuff, and guess what my mother says that I understand but he was also young at that time that mf was like 18-19 so I was like that shit was not young and if you think he was young then I was barely born.
She treated me very nicely for some days maybe traumatized or just showing sympathy.


But now after all this time that mf still comes home and my mother tells me to go and greet him and serve him chai/coffee etc and still takes his side on so many things in front of me .

This shit makes me feel sick how could she do that, people treat strangers better than this ...

It‚Äôs the day before my birthday and here goes another attempt: 

I miss making a woman feel loved and so many other aspects of a relationship. I‚Äôve been single and have been focusing on myself this year, but I can‚Äôt help but think about having a life partner. With it almost being my birthday it‚Äôs been heavy on my mind.

I‚Äôm incredibly affectionate, and I love words of affirmation. I express all love languages because I don‚Äôt believe in being dead set on one. I miss being held by another woman and holding them in return. I miss having intellectual conversations with someone who can also be a silly goose with me. I‚Äôm a texter, so you‚Äôll never be left on read for long, and one of my biggest focuses is having effective communication when a situation arises. 

A little about me: I‚Äôve lived in plenty of states ranging from the east to the west and then back to the east. I‚Äôm an avid traveler and will take a spontaneous road trip with you at any time (Can I drive though?). I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 with tattoos. I love creating art and working with my hands and can hyper-fixate on an art project for hours. I‚Äôm attentive and all about attention to detail when caring for someone, friends, family, or lover.

Sexually, I am attracted to femme lesbian as mentioned above. They make my heart go boom boom boom. Would love to be with someone who is a switch because sharing is caring, but I don‚Äôt mind being the dom for the majority of the time if we click and that‚Äôs what you prefer. Definitely kink friendly and can‚Äôt go through another vanilla relationship. 

Love to geek out with games when I have time. Watching horror movies, documentaries, or just a Disney movie will do. Music is pretty huge in my life and I‚Äôm almost always wearing my headphones. I love to propagate plants and gift them to everyone. I‚Äôm huge on having my morning coffee and evening tea during my self-care routine. Being outdoors is my haven as long as it‚Äôs not during the summer in an Arizona (did that for like seven years ü´†).  I‚Äôm looking to go back to school for either visual arts or IT this Fall. 



Anyway, I would love to get to know someone and have great banter with. Let‚Äôs see where this goes!

Whether you're debating if it‚Äôs worth the buzz or just entertaining the idea of switching to a long-lasting water filtration system, I've got you covered.

**A Design Built for Simplicity and Stability**  
The product offers a compact and lightweight build, weighing just 14.4 ounces, ideal for tight spaces like under the sink or behind the fridge. Measuring 3.38 x 3.38 x 10.78 inches, it doesn‚Äôt feel bulky, which is nice. Aesthetically, it‚Äôs not a joyride but hey, it‚Äôs a water filter, not a piece of art. What I did appreciate is how the fittings‚Äîa 1/4"" direct connect system‚Äîmade installation a breeze. I‚Äôve installed clunky filters before, but this one clicks into place without requiring tools or plumbing expertise, saving me a headache. From both plastic and copper water lines to RO systems, this filter adapts smoothly to diverse setups.

**Performance in Real-World Scenarios**  
Every sip of water, every ice cube from the freezer, feels fresher. The 0.5-micron coconut shell activated carbon block reduces not only chlorine but also PFAS/PFOA contaminants, odor, and other impurities. Does it make tap water taste like glacier spring water? Nearly. While I can't scientifically test its claims of removing 99% of chlorine and other nasties, I can vouch for its performance in improving taste and smell. My seven-year-old daughter, notorious for her selective taste, even noticed the improvement when I refilled her juice cup.

**Advantages**  
- Extended 5-year or 5,000-gallon service life, which reduces the hassle and continuous expense of frequent replacements.  
- Universal compatibility with refrigerators, ice makers, coffee machines, and even RV setups.  
- BPA-free and lead-free construction for peace of mind.  
- Quick installation system, requiring minimal effort or adjustment.

**Ease of Maintenance**  
Another standout feature is the low-maintenance aspect. Being someone juggling work and home responsibilities, I definitely don‚Äôt want to fuss over cleaning or replacing cumbersome parts. This filter simplifies things‚Äîyou only need to replace it after five years or based on how much water you consume. The instructions recommend a snug insertion of the PE tube (around 20mm) to avoid leaks. I can't emphasize this enough because a poorly fitted tube did cause a mini flood in my kitchen on day one. Lesson learned.

**Drawbacks That Might Make You Pause**  
- It doesn't reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), which might disappoint enthusiasts of ultra-purified water.  
- Although connection fittings are easy to handle, the plastic material raises concerns about long-term durability.  
- There's a slight drop in water pressure, although not deal-breaking, it's noticeable compared to no filter.  

**Competing Options for Fridge and Water Filters**  
Now, comparing this product to a competitor like the 3M Aqua-Pure Inline Water Filter, the AQUA CREST filter wins in longevity, as the latter usually supports a year or two at max. On the other hand, some high-end brands like EveryDrop might filter additional minerals and particles. If TDS filtration tops your priority, you may need alternatives or supplements. However, for casual, multi-purpose users like me, the AQUA CREST filter is like that dependable friend who gets the job done.

**Smart Spending Perspective**  
While the upfront cost might seem like a commitment compared to other water filters, the long-term savings justify the investment. Breaking it down, you're spending cents daily for cleaner-tasting water, and I find that worth the reliability it provides. Cheap systems might lure you in only to burden you with frequent replacement costs, but here, you‚Äôre essentially paying for peace of mind over the next several years.

1kugiqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kugiqy/people_selling_puppies_outside_my_house/,People Selling Puppies Outside my House,"I live in a residential neighborhood in a city on the East Coast where row houses are common, and we have brick sidewalks. We are about a block and a half from a farmers market on the weekends and get a lot of foot traffic, but I am a full block into the residential area. There are a park and a church right across the street and a triangle grassy where the streets come together just a 1/4 block from the park. In other words, there is lots of public space‚Äîwith sidewalks surrounding all of it. 

I arrived home one Saturday morning (after leaving early to get coffee) to find someone set up with a temporary fence holding about eight dogs on the parking between two grassy tree boxes right in front of my house. I asked what was going on and they replied, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre selling puppies.‚Äù 

I was really bothered by what felt like an intrusion into my personal space. Yes, the sidewalk is public property, but you have to have a permit to do business, and they are usually limited to commercial areas. Also, these puppies clearly were not trained yet, so they were going to poop and pee all over the sidewalk steps from my front door (like 12 feet). 

Before saying anything, I went inside to think about it. Then the puppies started barking. A LOT. I went out to my porch and told the people that there were lots of places that weren‚Äôt directly next to someone‚Äôs house, like right across the street, where they could set up. A few minutes later, they moved, which I appreciated.

I realize I should have asked them more directly to move. And I didn‚Äôt berate them or call the police on them. Reminder, they were set up illegally. 

But am I a jerk for not wanting them literally outside my house? If it were a lemonade stand, you would think it were my kids because of the positioning. And for the record, if it were a lemonade stand, I would just buy some and let them be. But these were puppies peeing and yapping right outside my door. 

I love dogs‚ÄîI have one, who was also pretty irritated by them even though she is very social most of the time.

I'm almost 3 months in on modified carnivore and doing great. Loving it. Mainly eat 1 lb of chuck or shoulder roast and butter. Baked chicken thighs with cheese and sour cream or rotisserie chicken with skin a couple times a week (1.5 lbs to feel full). I do drink coffee with necta sweet (sucralose). I do drink Zero Sugar soda- couple sips after dinner to assuage my sweet tooth until urge/habit is gone. Getting less and less. Of course, sometimes I like to party on Friday night so I actually have 4-6 ounces of zero sugar soda. Woo-hoo! No alcohol.

I'm also doing OMAD. More so out of habit - not a big breakfast/lunch guy so was a good fit. If I do get hungry in the afternoon, butter and some over-medium eggs. I can also just have a cup of coffee to put off eating. I drink a lot of coffee - about one pot a day. Not super strong, melt sand coffee. Not even close to Starbucks coffee. I get nauseous if I drink strong coffee all day. I do add butter to it.

Started at 274 and in 2 months and 3 weeks, 250lb. This even though I stalled for 2 weeks after the first month. LOVED the first month losing water weight - LOL! True about mental clarity, focus & less brain fog. Eyesight better. Also noticed less bleeding when brushing teeth. Would happen every so often, a little red. Now weeks with no blood. Even though I'm still overweight, I feel lighter, not bloated/stuffed & weighed down. I'm satiated by food and wake up feeling much better. Don't have to make an ""extra-effort"" to get myself out of bed.

Also, I have hypothyroidism. Started in 2022. Taking 100mcg Synthroid and is now within ranges. TBH, before and after taking medication, zero change in how I feel. Said I should feel more energy and possibly lose weight. A year after and no change. After carnivore, feel better. Definite change.

With that background, wanted to ask the group their thoughts on this magnesium supplement. It has the GABA sleep support and I like it as it helps to end the evening and get to bed.

Main reason I started taking this and water with Potassium Chloride Powder and salt is because my feet get hot. I read that was a dehydration issue and this worked for others. Taking all this seems to reduce hot feet.

So,

1. Do y'all like this magnesium supplement or is it acceptable? I have read some are better than others, especially for absorption. This has a mix so is it diluting a good magnesium or covering a lot of bases? Any recommendations welcomed!
2. I know some people don't get hot feet or take supplements. I don't feel a difference when I do or don't, other than hot feet. Even prior to taking supplement and drinking water with potassium+salt, didn't feel bad or tired. Just had hot feet. I'm in South Texas and working in the sun on our yard on occasion. At those times I drink plenty water, etc. No issues or dizziness. About a month after starting carnivore diet I began having hot feet.

The career platform he co-founded at just 20 now routes Fortune 500 job offers to over 17 million students and alumni. But Handshake‚Äôs origin story isn‚Äôt classic Silicon Valley. It‚Äôs pure Midwest grit‚Äîa startup born of handwritten notes, McDonald‚Äôs Wi-Fi, and a $2,000 Ford Focus.

It was the kind of story we live for at the **Bay Area Founders Club**‚Äîand one I knew our 30,000+ founders, builders, and dreamers needed to hear.

>*‚ÄúTalent is evenly distributed; the on-ramps are not. Our job as founders is to pour concrete where the highway ends.‚Äù* ‚Äî Garrett Lord CEO at Hanshake, Stanford ETL, May 21, 2025

# Detroit Winters, Silicon Dreams

Garrett‚Äôs journey began outside Detroit‚Äîthrough community college, then Michigan Tech in the snowy Upper Peninsula. It was ‚Äúcloser to a moose than a Google recruiter,‚Äù he joked. The talent around him was undeniable. The access? Not so much.

An early internship at Los Alamos changed everything. The next year, he landed at Palantir and met Stanford interns fluent in ""cap table"" and ""seed round"" speak. He returned to Michigan armed with the most powerful entrepreneurial motivator:

>**rage at an avoidable injustice.**

# Coffee Mugs and the Ford Focus Doctrine

Handshake‚Äôs first version was built on:



* A $2,000 Ford Focus loaned by Garrett‚Äôs dad
* 1,000 ceramic mugs with college mascots
* A Sharpie for hand-written notes

They drove 10,000+ miles, crashed in McDonald's parking lots, and snuck into campus pools for showers. The coffee mugs weren‚Äôt swag‚Äîthey were Trojan horses. Each mug got them 30 minutes with a career center director. That turned into 5 pilot campuses. Then into the seed of a network.

>*‚ÄúA mug can out-negotiate a cold email‚Äîif you‚Äôre willing to drive far enough.‚Äù*

Our BFC founders felt that. We‚Äôve taped together MVPs the night before demo day. But Garrett‚Äôs commitment‚Äîmeasured in road miles and borrowed showers‚Äîreminded us: **real grit leaves a trail.**

# The Keystone Strategy

Garrett didn‚Äôt chase dollars first. He chased **the roster.**

Instead of going straight to recruiters, he sold to universities‚Äîthe gatekeepers of student directories. Once schools came online, students followed. Once students were active, recruiters had no choice but to join. It was network effect aikido.

We jotted down:

>*Who‚Äôs my roster-holder?* *What system of record can I rebuild?*

# 150 No‚Äôs, 1 Yes

The road to funding wasn‚Äôt glamorous. ‚ùå 150 rejections. üõãÔ∏è Couch-surfing. üéß Morning runs scored by Gucci Mane and doubt. üè† A refinanced family home to keep the dream alive.

The ‚Äúyes‚Äù came only after live pilots and an LOI from a Fortune 500. Garrett didn‚Äôt chase hype. He built receipts.

>*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not looking for ten term sheets. You‚Äôre looking for the one believer already living in your future.‚Äù*

# Culture Written in Road Dust

At Handshake, hustle wasn‚Äôt temporary‚Äîit became culture.



* Every launch passes the **Ford Focus test**: would this feature have saved a campus trip?
* All-hands start with a student story, not a metric.
* Each quarter, founders ask: *‚ÄúAm I still the best person for this job?‚Äù*



We took notes. At our next BFC town hall, we‚Äôll open with a founder win‚Äînot an MRR chart. Stories move people. Metrics just move sliders.

# From Job Board to Talent OS

Today, Handshake is powered by machine learning. Recruiters search ‚ÄúRust-fluent interns in Texas‚Äù and LLMs respond. AI interview simulators mimic real hiring panels.

But Garrett waited. He ignored early AI hype and only moved when users demanded it.

>*‚ÄúAdopt the wave when it breaks on your beach‚Äînot when Twitter says surf‚Äôs up.‚Äù*

# What We Packed Back to BFC

üõ† **Bridge where the road ends** Talent gaps are market gaps in disguise.

‚òïÔ∏è **Pick your Ford Focus gesture** The mug. The prototype. The late-night Figma file. Make the hustle visible.

üìá **Court the roster-holder** Someone owns the master list in every industry. Find them. Win them.

‚è≥ **Let love ripen before rent** Handshake didn‚Äôt charge employers for five years. Networks grow best when trust comes first.

üìú **Write rituals before you raise** Culture isn‚Äôt set by funding‚Äîit‚Äôs set by founding.

# A Closing Whisper to Founders Everywhere

We stepped out into a golden Palo Alto dusk, hearts full, minds spinning.

Maybe your Ford Focus is a bus ticket. A GitHub repo. A handwritten note. What matters is **the drive**‚Äîthe belief that overlooked people deserve on‚Äëramps, and that **you‚Äôre willing to pour the asphalt yourself**.

As Garrett Lord proved, a compact car can carry a billion-dollar dream‚Äîif the trunk‚Äôs packed with grit and the passenger seat, with empathy.

Keep building,

1kugaa5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1kugaa5/questions_from_an_engineer/,Questions from an engineer,"Hi guys!

Firstly - thanks to mods for letting me post this!

Long story short I'm a software & mechanical engineer (and recent grad) who's always been interested in the first responder space for a lot of reasons. The biggest one is that it's such a high and positive impact field, and I want to help change the world for better.

With that being said, I've recently been trying to learn more about the space, the problems in it, etc. So, I was hoping to ask a few questions

1. What is the day-to-day in the life like? (Is it mostly sitting around the station, admin work, etc, what's the actual breakdown?)
2. What's the most painful/unpleasant part of the job?
3. What gets in the way of doing the job well, on a consistent basis?
4. What is the most painful recent memory you have on the job? (doesn't need to be anything hugely awful like a bad car accident - can literally be 'i spilled coffee on myself'!)
5. What feels like a problem that drives you crazy, that you're surprised hasn't been solved yet?
6. How does safety feel on the job? Do you ever worry if SHTF, that your guys might not know?
7. Do you feel like at any given moment, everyone else knows what your up to and your status? Are there things that aren't kept track of, that you wish were?
8. Are you satisfied with the current state of firefighting, or do you think there needs to be change? (This can be anything, equipment sucks, policy sucks etc - afterall 200 years of tradition and all..)
9. For my senior officers out there - what sucks the most about your job?
10. Again for my senior officers/captains out there - what's the hardest part about being a senior officer? Do you feel like managing so many officers is hard?
11. For my chiefs / dep chiefs - what's the hardest part of what you do?
12. Do you feel like there's a question I should've asked, that I missed? Really feel free to pour your heart out here!

And finally, thank you guys for your service. I realize being a first responder is really unforgiving, but I like to think most of us appreciate and understand the importance of what you guys do. I've got a good amount of positive memories with firefighters and think you guys are especially badass.

Hope my questions aren't too strange!",1,1748105817.0,Firefighting,2,0.67,False

1kug8qo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kug8qo,‚ÄúPeter was Nerfed in SM2‚Äù,"Heads up, this is a yappy rant (I‚Äôm on my second coffee today lol) 

I absolutely hate the lazy ass narrative that Peter was nerfed in SM2. One of the main claims people make is suggesting it was done to somehow prop up Miles, which is just so ridiculous imo. People also contribute Peter being ‚Äúnerfed‚Äù to the games writing, when in fact, they don‚Äôt take into account the context of what happened in SM1 vs SM2. In world time, the first game stretches about a month. Peter has much more time to recover physically and mentally, all the while fighting much weaker villains in SM1. The narrative of SM2 stretches about 8-9 days, and in that time he fights the some of the strongest versions we‚Äôve ever seen of Kraven, The Lizard, and Venom (He also fought Scream and Miles as well.) I mean, Kraven wiped most of Spider-Man‚Äôs rogue gallery from the first game himself. If that‚Äôs not already enough to indicate a clear difference in what Peter had to deal with, you can‚Äôt also forget he was grieving Aunt May‚Äôs death in SM2, as well as trying to save his best friend‚Äôs life. He might not of had as many spectacular feats in SM2, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs nerfed. I know everyone is gonna point to the fridge moment, but I give it a pass due to all he endured in the 6-7 days leading up to that moment. Plus, every rendition of Spider-Man has been dropped by some pretty stupid things. What do you guys think?",188,1748105705.0,SpidermanPS4,49,0.87,False
1kug8oe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kug8oe/i_worked_as_a_security_guard_at_area_51/,I worked as a security guard at Area 51.,"There‚Äôs a level of anxiety that comes with starting a new job that I just hate. Not sure if it‚Äôs just the process of learning what to do, the pressure of proving myself to new coworkers, or just the stress of being in a new environment, but it‚Äôs been a constant across every job I‚Äôve ever taken. This newest one piled that anxiety on to the max though, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be going back after what happened last night. 

To be perfectly clear, if I end up hitting send on this and you‚Äôre reading it right now, well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not really up to me if I go back to work or not. They‚Äôre probably going to ship me off to some blacksite that‚Äôs further off the map than my current position. One week here and I‚Äôve learned all those conspiracy theories Americans have about Area 51 barely begin to scratch the surface, so might as well go for broke and tell the whole story, right?

I‚Äôve been in the Air Force for about five years now, and this was supposed to be my latest post. Something my commanding officers said was a breeze, which I honestly had doubts about considering I‚Äôve been in Germany for the last two years and it was, for lack of a better description, the easiest shit I‚Äôve ever done. They said it would be just as easy, except I would get to be back on home turf in the desert of Nevada. Guard duty isn‚Äôt that hard anyway, right? Assuming you‚Äôre guarding humans‚Ä¶

My first day started out like any other I‚Äôve had. Get to the base, find the CO there, and get my orders directly from them. They assigned me to this older officer as my trainer, Mills, and he started leading me through the main building towards our post. According to him, all we had to do was keep an eye on the security cams for the entire place and notify higher ups if anything looked out of place. 

The base itself was‚Ä¶ well, what you expect from a base in the middle of the desert. A few big, nondescript buildings surrounded by fences with a healthy amount of razor wire. I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting much when I got in, but imagine my surprise when Mills told me to hop into a golfcart so we could get to the monitor room. I mean I always figured there was more to Area 51 than what we could see from the outside, but then we drove at least four miles through this huge tunnel on a pretty steep incline. He was talking to me the whole time, asking me if I had found a place to live nearby yet and telling me about staying away from the Vegas Strip on my off days  Seemed like we were driving for hours through a long concrete tunnel, my stomach getting more and more uneasy with every passing foot, when we finally stopped in front of a small door built into the side of the tunnel.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky, kid. This has to be the cushiest job in the entire US military. We just watch these screens and give a little check in every other hour. Sometimes they‚Äôll have us do rounds and check doors. Otherwise, I get to sit here and work on my sudoku puzzles for as long as I want while getting top dollar for it!‚Äù He said to me when we entered. The room was surprisingly big, with almost the two entire walls filled floor to ceiling with monitors that we were supposed to keep track of. Some showed empty, grey rooms with nothing but abandoned desks, others were static shots of desert sand, another with the exterior of the buildings we entered through‚Ä¶ then one in the upper right corner caught my eye.

‚ÄúWhat in the world is that?‚Äù I asked, pointing to the screen in question. Mills gave a chuckle, pulling up a chair at the small desk and grabbing the nearby mouse. With a few clicks, he enlarged the image for me to see better. 

In the middle of a small, all-white room, sat a table. On that table was one small body, and at first I honestly thought it was a child. Maybe the kid of a superior officer having a nap or something while their dad was working, I don‚Äôt fucking know. Then when Mills made the picture bigger I noticed the odd proportions of it. A massive head, long arms and legs with a small torso that seemed barely strong enough to hold up the rest of it. The grey, flushed skin was nearly a pale white that looked sickly against the walls of the room

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fucking with me, right?‚Äù I asked, looking back at Mills. He smiled, shaking his head and putting the screen back on multi-view.

‚ÄùNope. Welcome to orientation day, kid. That there is an original.‚Äù He said, taking a seat and pulling out a massive thermos before beginning to pour the contents into a mug. ‚ÄúWhat did they tell you when you were assigned here?‚Äù

‚ÄùNothing, pretty much.‚Äù I said, mind swirling. There was no way he just confirmed the existence of aliens so‚Ä¶ casually. It was like showing me an animal in a zoo exhibit for him. All he was doing was smiling, watching as I tried to reconcile what I was seeing on the screen. Scanning through different views from the cameras, I began to notice even more odd sights. A massive disk in one that had tons of tech set up all around it, a mechanic using an arc welder on one side. Another view showed‚Ä¶ something in another room. It looked like a concentrated ball of darkness, the occasional tendril reaching outward towards the door before a light would come on causing it to snap back into place. Then another room, with one lone person sitting in a chair, dressed like your every day civilian with just a shit-eating grin on his face. All of it looked so out of place to the regular human but Mills was smiling at me like it was just another day. ‚ÄúSo what is all this?‚Äù

‚ÄùWell, what have you heard about Roswell 1947?‚Äù He shot back at me. I shrugged as he continued, ‚ÄúDoppelg√§ngers, dark matter, all kinds of weird shit out there that the regular joe doesn‚Äôt get to know about. Come on, want some coffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you mean all the little green men cartoons and shit like that‚Ä¶ all real? Like not even an exaggeration or change to how they look?‚Äù I sat next to him, taking the mug of coffee he offered and sipping slow. It burned a little, but that burn was helping to distract me from the near-existential crisis going on in my head at the moment. 

‚ÄúBest way to hide something is to do it in plain sight.‚Äù He retorted. ‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôre not green, as you can see. More of a grey pallor, though they look a lot like a corpse in most lighting. That one there is perfectly healthy though, far as we can tell.‚Äù

‚ÄùHow can you tell? It looks dead.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, we don‚Äôt have anything that can pierce its skin, and of course vitals aren‚Äôt going to be the same as what we measure for ourselves, but they have picked up brain waves. From as far as sixty feet away, even. That‚Äôs why that room has lead walls three feet thick. Damn thing will start talking into your brain if you‚Äôre close enough.‚Äù He muttered, his face flickering for a moment from being playful to a look of horror.

‚ÄùTelepathy?‚Äù I asked. He only nods.

‚ÄùSome Professor X shit if I‚Äôve ever seen it. Went through it myself on one of my first guard duties here. They didn‚Äôt have the walls thick enough yet and when I passed by on rounds it started screaming in my head.‚Äù

I nearly choked on the hot coffee, earning myself a coughing fit in the process. ‚ÄúWhat did it‚Ä¶ what did it say?‚Äù

‚ÄùBegged me to let it go. Then when it realized I couldn‚Äôt do that it started begging me to kill it. It hasn‚Äôt moved from that table in the almost eighty years its been here so they think it‚Äôs paralyzed or something, totally unable to move. Probably happened in the crash. Was like it was reading my mind though because I barely got the thought out and it was screaming curses at me for letting it live. Hell, like I have a choice. Uncle Sam would have me erased from existence if I did that.‚Äù He looked around the monitors, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say I blame it for asking though. Must be a hell of an existence just‚Ä¶ stuck there like that.‚Äù

I just couldn‚Äôt compute what was happening. Somewhere in my brain was a voice going ‚ÄòWell, of course aliens exist‚Äô while a whole other section was telling me this makes everything I‚Äôve ever known a total lie. Why the hell did I get chosen for this post? I‚Äôm nothing remarkable, I haven‚Äôt done anything bad to piss off superiors so why would they put me here and shatter my entire worldview? Did someone really just hate me? Or was I just another faceless rank that they tossed on the job.

‚ÄùJust don‚Äôt let it get to you too bad, alright?‚Äù Mills said, genuine concern on his face now. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs a lot to take in, but trust me, it‚Äôs normal after a while. Just don‚Äôt think too hard on any of it.‚Äù

The rest of the day was spent watching monitors and doing rounds. Between our patrols Mills clued me in on the‚Ä¶ guests that were kept around here. The grey was obviously the big deal, but the other things on the screen were a whole other ballgame of weird. 

The disk thing was the ship the grey arrived in. Not too big of a surprise there. Mills said they haven‚Äôt been able to crack the damn thing since the crash though. There‚Äôs no door in, no visible way out, and nothing we have can get through the hull, though the guy with the arc welder gave it his best for about three hours before finally calling it quits. 

Dark matter was what he called the‚Ä¶ well, the mass of darkness in the lighted room. Said he wasn‚Äôt sure where the hell they found it, but anything that went into the dark never came out. There were at least ten high powered UV lamps in that room that acted as a deterrent, and apparently it could assimilate any sort of shadow or darkness, potentially using it to escape.

By far the creepiest one though was the doppelg√§nger.  Mills mentioned to me that it had breached containment once before, able to nearly perfectly imitate any human it wants. About brought the entire damn place down and killed five guards before they got it back into a cell. It just‚Ä¶ sat there. Totally rigid, upright, smiling huge with pointed, inhuman teeth that gave away it wasn‚Äôt one of us. Damn thing gave me a shiver every time the rotating cameras passed back over it. 

I went home that night unable to sleep. I know it seems cliche but finding out we aren‚Äôt alone in this universe is fucking terrifying. Like ruin your entire worldview level shit. I was raised Baptist, and even though I didn‚Äôt hold to it I started to question if god was even real. And if he was‚Ä¶ why the hell would he make anything like what was being kept in Area 51?

That was four days ago. The next two days were uneventful, for the most part. Some dumbass conspiracy theorists were trying to climb one of the fences near the upper base, but here underground in lower base, nobody knew we were there. Mills about drove me out of my mind with small talk. The guy is nice and everything, but when you‚Äôre looking at aliens and deadly mimics on security cameras it seems kind of trivial to discuss your favorite food or what was on television the night before. 

Last night everything went straight to hell. 

I got in for my first solo guard duty. Guess three days of training was expected to be enough time to acclimate myself to the horrors of the universe Uncle Sam was hiding deep below the Nevada desert. Wish I had called out, if we‚Äôre being honest.

Around 9:30, not long after the last rays of sunlight had finally faded over the horizon, I went on my first patrol of the night. Through the long tunnel, down to the cells area. A long hallway, each holding cell about thirty feet apart with most of that space filled with solid concrete between rooms. There were other guards on duty, of course. Each cell had two men posted outside, ready in case anything might make a break for it. 

From the cells it was back upstairs to upper base and R&D where they were trying to crack the Disk once again, this time with a massive laser setup that looked like it could do some gnarly damage if it was aimed elsewhere. Nothing out of the ordinary, so far. 

When I got back to the monitor room it was around 10:30. Going through the cameras nothing was really out of the ordinary. The dark matter had the UV lights all the way up, a normal precaution during the night hours. Why, when we were over a hundred feet below ground, is beyond my pay grade. Not like sunlight is reaching down here to help during the day. The doppelg√§nger was sitting, staring into the corner. I didn‚Äôt stay on the camera for it too long because it made me shiver involuntarily. It was like no matter if it was facing you or not, it could always see you. I swear it was watching me more than I was watching it, and there was no fucking way it could see me. 

Eventually I hit the outer cameras. These things were all over the surface, disguised as cactuses, shrubbery, random rocks‚Ä¶ whatever could hide a camera had one in it, covering every possible inch of the surface above the real base. It was camera 46 that stood out tonight though.

I don‚Äôt know if I would have noticed it if it weren‚Äôt a clear night. Every damn star in the sky was visible through the cams, shining bright to show the entire desert. Except right up in the top left side of the camera‚Äôs view. There, the stars were blinking and moving ever so slightly, wavering from side to side like something was swinging them around for its own amusement. 

As I stared it began to affect more of the stars nearby, nearly engulfing everything in view before finally settling in. As I looked closer, reaching for my radio to call one of the surface guards, something flashed.

Every camera went out, along with the lights. The base shut down completely for a moment, darkness taking over as whatever flashed outside cut off the electricity. Before I could even reach for a flashlight, it was back on though. My face was mirrored on the black screen, a look of fear in my eyes.

I booted everything back up, looking close as it took its sweet time, desperate to bring Cam 46 back up so I could see what the hell was going on. My worried expression stared back at me as alarms began going off across the base.

‚ÄùAttention, lock down protocols are now active. Please stay at your post and report any strange occurrences. Lock down protocols are now active. Do not, under any circumstances, open cell doors.‚Äù

The screen came back on, but it wasn‚Äôt on cam 46. Instead, there was my own face, still staring back at me but this time in full HD color, rows of sharp teeth in a huge grin smiling right at me. Nearly fell back out of my chair when I realized the doppelg√§nger was staring straight into the camera, taunting me. I don‚Äôt know how the hell it took my face, whether it could just sense me there through the camera or it just did it randomly, but it freaked me the fuck out. 

‚ÄúWash! Wash! What the hell are you doing in there?!‚Äù The radio started cackling. I could barely hear it through my own racing heartbeat, one of the superior officers on the base calling for me to check in. Meanwhile the doppelg√§nger was still just staring at me over the screen, daring me to make some kind of move or come after it. My hands shaking, reaching for the radio, I pushed the button down to talk back.

‚ÄùYes sir, I‚Äôm here.‚Äù My voice sounded distant, frail. The smile on the doppelg√§nger seemed to get bigger as my fear grew. 

‚ÄúWell what the hell happened out there? Did you see anything on the surveillance?‚Äù He shot back.

‚ÄùThere was something in the sky, like it was shimmering. Then a flash and everything went out.‚Äù I stammered back.

‚ÄùSon of a bitch, they‚Äôre back!‚Äù He was shouting now.

‚ÄùWho? Who‚Äôs back?‚Äù Good god, you would think if there was some history of attacks on this place they would have clued me in so I could keep an eye out.

‚ÄúGreys.‚Äù He replied. That was when a huge explosion sent a tremor through the building. Switching through the cameras back to the one above ground, I could see that the sky wasn‚Äôt empty anymore. There were at least three disks, just like the one being kept down here in R&D, hovering in the sky. One fired off a thin beam of light towards the ground, causing another tremor to rock the base. Lights flickered, but didn‚Äôt quite go out this time.

‚ÄùI need someone with eyes outside to answer me, what the fuck is happening!‚Äù Another voice came over the radio.

‚ÄùMultiple hostile spotted over lower and upper bases. We are under attack!‚Äù Someone else answered. Clicking through the screens, even more of the disks were visible over the above-ground base, already firing off shots at the buildings up there and sending them up in flames. It took everything in me not to just sit in the corner and cower, desperate to believe that this was just a bad dream. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got worse problems. The dark matter escaped when the power went out. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not good.‚Äù He said.

Should I run? I was trying to come up with any kind of plan to get out of here, job be damned. The only way of escape I knew of was through the tunnel back up to upper base though. Even if I managed to escape up there, there‚Äôs still the problem of these damned flying saucers that would probably evaporate me on sight. Maybe my best hope was just to stay down here, out of sight, out of mind, and wait for everything to calm down before I escape‚Ä¶

‚ÄùAAAAHHHHH!‚Äù Another voice over the radio, screaming out in pain. ‚ÄúHelp! Send reinforcements to upper base, they‚Äôre coming in!‚Äù

I flipped the cameras over, watching as the disks let out an even larger beam of light. On the ground where they shone, more of the aliens suddenly began to appear. They looked just like the one laying on the table down the hall, but far more dangerous. A soldier moved towards them, raising his gun and firing off a couple of rounds at one of the alien‚Äôs massive head. The bullets stopped in front of it like the Matrix, hovering in midair for a moment before falling harmless to the ground below. 

The Grey didn‚Äôt take that particularly well. Honestly, can‚Äôt say I would blame it, getting shot at is never something you just shrug off. But it simply looked at the soldier, barely even moving its head. What I saw next was something that no horror movie or years of watching Liveleak could have prepared me for.

Something picked the shooter up, raising him into the air with invisible hands. He struggled against it, begging it to let him go. Before anyone else could step up to help though, he began folding in on himself. I couldn‚Äôt hear the bones cracking over the cameras, thank God, but I could vaguely hear his screams of pain as they were caught by the small microphone. He kept folding, smaller and smaller until he was barely the size of a baseball, compressed into an orb of flesh and pulverized bone, dripping blood as it hovered there over the ground. 

‚ÄúOh my god.‚Äù I muttered as the Grey simply moved its head slightly, sending the flesh ball flying through the stomach of another soldier that was approaching. It punched straight through the poor guy, making a huge hole as it blew chunks of intestines and bone through his back. 

The Grey continued on, unimpeded as it simply crushed anyone that got in its way. I could only watch in terror as it walked calmly through a dozen men, taking them all out without even lifting a finger. More began to beam down to the surface, following it toward its goal and joining the march.

‚ÄúFall back! Air support is inbound!‚Äù The radio cackled to life once more. On one of the big monitors I could see a jet take off from one of the nearby runways, already beginning to veer back around so it could fire a shot at the disks floating nearby. Two choppers took off around the same time, taking their own positions close by. Before I knew it, the plane and choppers all fired off their shots, aiming for the cluster of disks.

A bright flash of light came from the disk closest to the ground, causing munitions to explode in midair before they could even touch the alien vessels. A small laser erupted from it next, quickly spinning around the edge of the disk. As it passed through the choppers and plane in a clean arc, they split, flames engulfing them from the subsequent explosion. 

It was pure hell outside. Nothing we had could possibly stand up to these things. There was no other choice but to run. 

Except I couldn‚Äôt. The Greys would be coming through the tunnel and that was my only way out. The other way was the cells and after hearing about the darkness escaping‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it was worth the risk.

All I could do was wait. There‚Äôs no point risking a direct run in unless I wanted to die horribly. No, it was time to hunker down and wait for the storm to pass.

I got up, closed the door, locked it, and tried to move what spare furniture I had in front to block it off further. If anything got in here, I only had my handgun on me and god knows that‚Äôs like hunting a bear with a water gun. Nope, got to play this smart and avoid any kind of confrontation.

If only it was that easy. I kept my eyes on the monitors after that, tracing movements of the Greys while keeping an eye on the lower cells. They were‚Ä¶ well, the dark matter obviously wasn‚Äôt in its cell anymore. The lights were on, but they were simply illuminating the bright white room now. Where the darkness managed to go, I‚Äôm not really sure. There were a dozen guards stationed at each end of the cell block though, each shining a UV light around, trying to illuminate any shadowy corners where it could have been hiding. 

Another explosion made the ground under my feet tremble. The Greys had broken through the tunnel now and begun a slow but deliberate descent towards the lower base. They would probably pass me in around ten minutes, meaning I just needed to keep holding out. The other monitor showed that my time here was coming to an end though. 

The lights flickered when that explosion came through, plunging the cell block hallway into total darkness for just a fraction of a second. That was all the dark matter needed though. It must have used that brief time to flank around the soldiers at one end of the hall, and as they were still flinging their lights around desperately, shadows suddenly began to swallow them one by one. It was like‚Ä¶ well, it was almost cartoonish. They were just falling right into these massive pits of darkness that would appear in the wall or floor. Like a damned cartoon gag, but when they got sucked in it looked painful, like they were entering a black hole and being torn into shreds as it pulled them in. 

‚ÄúHey man, let me in!‚Äù Someone began knocking at my door. They sounded terrified. Can‚Äôt say I blamed them. ‚ÄúCome on, they‚Äôre coming! Don‚Äôt let them get me, please!‚Äù

‚ÄùHold on, I‚Äôve got to move the furniture!‚Äù I shouted back through, starting to move the chairs. 

‚ÄúPlease, Wash, hurry! They‚Äôre gonna kill me if they see me!‚Äù He shouted back through as I was starting to unlock the door. I froze instead, hand just about to turn the deadbolt and let him through. Slowly, I turned back to the monitors, afraid that I was right about what I was about to see. 

The only other person on base I had spoken to and given my name were the commanding officer on upper base and Mills. Neither of them were here tonight. Sure enough, as I faced the monitor, I saw the room that the doppelg√§nger was being held in- empty.

‚ÄùWaaaaaash! Let me in!‚Äù The voice shouted again. Something was off about it. Like it was more than one voice saying the same thing, but talking out of turn so they didn‚Äôt quite harmonize. ‚ÄúLetmeinletmeinletmein!‚Äù

All I could do was pile the chairs in front of the door again, desperately hoping it would go away. I don‚Äôt know how it knew my name, but when it spoke my blood ran cold. There was pure malice in its voice, and all I could feel was that it was going to hurt me. I got this distinct feeling that it didn‚Äôt want to kill me though, only inflict as much pain as it could.

My blood ran cold as I made my way back behind my desk, climbing under it and holding hands over my ears as it just kept screaming at me. The voice kept changing, turning into other people as it first begged me to let it in, then turned more violent, demanding that I open the door for it to get through. Before long it must have gotten bored though, because it stopped knocking on the door and shouting. I waited a few minutes, afraid if I came out of my hiding spot it would just be waiting there on the other side of the desk, that huge grin full of teeth ready to devour me within seconds as soon as it saw me. 

I took a deep breath, crawling out little by little as the monitors above me blared with chaos. Everything on upper base was a disaster, fire all over the place. Even if I can get through the tunnel and get back there, making it through the flames was going to be a whole other challenge. God, I didn‚Äôt even know if my car was crushed out there considering all the carnage. A walk through the desert in the middle of the night was almost as dangerous as the aliens attacking from every direction. 

The lights flickered again as another explosion rocked the base. Looking at the monitors, I could see the Greys approaching my section of the tunnel. All I could do was keep quiet, hoping that they didn‚Äôt try to look in here as they continued along their war path. 

Too much to ask, especially for my luck. The first Grey that was leading the pack stopped in front of my door. It raised a hand and I heard the metal begin to bend and creak. Diving back under the desk, I pulled myself in as much as I could, desperate to avoid being seen as it ripped the door from the hinges without even touching it. 

Pretty sure I involuntarily squealed a little when the door hit the wall, falling to the floor with an even louder bang as the Grey stepped into the room. I saw its feet as it walked around for a moment, inspecting its surroundings for whatever it was looking for. It stopped in front of the monitors, staying there for the longest minute of my life as it studied them before walking back out, leading the rest of the Greys forward. 

At that point I could only assume they were after the one that was laying in a cell down the hall. Guess aliens have the same code of ‚Äúno man left behind‚Äù that we do. Who says we have nothing in common, right? Too bad they were slaughtering us to make sure it happened.

I have to get out of here. There‚Äôs no excuses now, I was exposed to the dangers outside without a door on the hinges. I had to move. Fast.

Looking at the monitors, the Greys were far enough ahead in the tunnel that I could slip out without them noticing. I poked my head out, making sure there were no stragglers that could fold me like origami with their mind, and started my escape. Running as fast as I could towards upper base, I was quickly out of breath. The incline in here was killer, and god knows it‚Äôs at least a couple of miles directly up. Nevertheless, I‚Äôve got to keep trying. 

I managed to get maybe halfway there before I came across a body. It was slumped next to a wall, head down and blood all over the front of its uniform. As I got closer, trying to give it a wide berth, it began to cough. I paused, unsure of what my next move should be.

If it‚Äôs another soldier the obvious answer is that I should help, right? But then there was the other chance nagging at the back of my mind. I‚Äôve had this‚Ä¶ pit in my stomach since the run-in with the doppelg√§nger. This guy could just be that damned thing trying to lure in prey. If it is‚Ä¶ well, then trying to help him is a death sentence.

‚ÄùH-help.‚Äù A weak voice came through the coughing. Ah, hell. I can‚Äôt leave them in good conscience to die on the slight chance they could be that damned monster. I know it goes against self-preservation, but I can‚Äôt just leave him here. 

‚ÄúHey man, what the hell got you?‚Äù I said, moving toward him slowly. His head tilted a little, looking for where my voice was coming from. As he looked up, I could see that although he was pretty messed up, he was definitely human. His throat was slashed pretty bad though, and judging by the amount of blood everywhere, he wasn‚Äôt making it out of this tunnel. 

‚ÄúDamned thing‚Ä¶ disguised itself as one of us.‚Äù He gurgled out. The doppelg√§nger then. It had been through here already. Shit, was I going to have to face it when I get to upper base? Before I could think further, he kept talking. ‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ he tore out their throats with his damned teeth. Ate them while they were still screaming. I tried stabbing him but he slashed me‚Ä¶ oh, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to make it. It‚Äôs cold‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúHey, hey, stay with me, okay? I‚Äôm going to get help and come back here for you, alright?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄùIs that death?‚Äù He asked, pointing towards the tunnel going to lower base. I looked forward, squinting as the light seemed to dim. It was definitely getting darker‚Ä¶

‚ÄùOh shit.‚Äù Was all I could get out before a long shadow appeared in the middle of the room, steadily getting closer as it made its way out. God knows what this thing can do once it hits outside, but I wasn‚Äôt about to stay around here and figure it out. I grabbed the soldier, hoisting him over my shoulder and starting to move as fast as we could.

This guy was dead weight, almost cold to the touch too, not able to contribute at all to escaping certain death. We got a few feet before I tripped over one of his legs while trying to haul his limp body, dropping him as I fell to the ground. 

The shadow caught up, taking hold of one of his feet first then slowly drawing the rest of him in, whatever blood he had left in there slowly seeping out as it crumpled his body into shadow. 

Look, it might seem like I got over it quick, but I promise once the dark had him there was no saving him. Instead I ran my ass off, heading towards upper base as fast as I could in the hopes that I could outrun that primordial dark that was still devouring a man behind me. After a minute, I could tell I was getting close. Smoke began to fill the tunnel, causing me to nearly choke as I ran, gasping for breath desperately. 

Emerging from the tunnel almost made me want to go back in and chance it with the darkness. The disks filled the sky above and everything was on fire. I had to move carefully, afraid that they were going to vaporize me in seconds if they caught sight of me. My best bet was to go around the main building and find my way to the parking lot. If my car wasn‚Äôt totaled, then I could maybe wait out the disks until they leave then get the hell out of dodge. It was a pretty far-fetched plan, but it was all I had at the time. 

Slowly, sticking to whatever shadows I could with the fear that they might devour me any second, I made my way from the tunnel entrance to the R&D building. Logically, the parking lot was on the other side of it, so I could just go straight through the building and out the other side, minimizing my risk of being seen by the disks or the Greys as they made their return trip. 

Inside of R&D was rough. There were various aircraft in differing stages of construction, with pieces and parts all over the place. Different testing arrays lit up on one side of the massive hanger, while down at the far end, there was something making a continuous beeping noise. Further on to my left I could see one of the disks, the one that we had in our inventory from the old crash. The big laser cutter was still sitting nearby, lights blinking on a control panel to show it had been abandoned mid use. 

A loud crash made me jump. Just up ahead, in shadows between the fluorescent bulbs, was a soldier. He had pushed something over, seemingly on the hunt for something in the huge hangar. 

I tried to hide from it, trying to quietly duck towards one of the walls and out of the fluorescent lights where it could see me. Unfortunately for me, this place was a mess, and I tripped over a rolling tool box that was in the path, causing it to crash to the ground.

Not sure what I expected to happen, but the creature let out a roar when it heard the noise, now aware that it wasn‚Äôt alone in here. The roar was quickly stifled though, instead being replaced by a discordant voice that phased in and out of normal range, moving from male to female, adult to child as it tried to modulate. As it‚Äôs turned, I kept going to try and hide, even though it felt futile. 

‚ÄúCome here.‚Äù It shouted, moving towards where I was ducked down behind a workbench. ‚ÄúSon of a bitch, get OVER HERE!‚Äù

As it got closer I could feel the sense of dread in my stomach growing. I couldn‚Äôt make out the face, covered in shadows, but where its eyes were seemed to be shining. Reflecting little bits of light like a predators will in the dark, looking for its next meal. I don‚Äôt know if it could see in the dark, but I could swear it was homing in on my with ease. 

‚ÄúWash, it‚Äôs you!‚Äù The doppelg√§nger shouted now. Shit, it must have seen me. I had to make a run, hell with giving my position away. If I was faster, I could make it to the far door and get the hell out of here before it had a chance to catch up. ‚ÄúCome here!‚Äù

It moved fast. Faster than I had ever seen any human move in my life, seemingly going down on all fours to run at me faster. As it closed in, I fell back, crashing to the ground beside the disk as it gained ground on me. Looking around, I grabbed my gun from its holster, leveling it at the doppelg√§nger and firing. My aim was good, and the bullet hit it right in the face, making its head blast back for a moment.

‚ÄùNow why would you do that?‚Äù It said again. The voice was more discordant this time, hundreds of different inflections and tones all fighting for supremacy under the tide of noise. The prevailing feeling I got from it now wasn‚Äôt just malice, it was anger. I had pissed it off, and now it really wanted to hurt me, even more so than before.

I scrambled, firing off more shots into the monster. They each hit, but did nothing when it came to slowing it down. The bullets were useless, and as I looked around, my only options were crowbars, various mechanic tools, and‚Ä¶ the laser. 

I have no idea how to use this damned thing, so I just had to hope that when it was left here, they had already primed it so it was ready to go. The doppelg√§nger lurched frontward, screaming at me in an ancient language I couldn‚Äôt understand. I turned the dial on the console, all the way towards the top to max it out, and hit the green button that was lit up next to it.

The light that came out of that thing was practically blinding. I closed my eyes, turning my head as it flashed. I could hear the damned creature screaming even louder now, and smelled something burning as the laser hit it. After a moment, the light died down, and I finally opened my eyes.

The doppelg√§nger lay on the ground, half its face melted and the entire torso on fire. It was twitching on the ground, still cursing me in an ancient language, but unable to keep moving. 

I‚Äôll be honest, I wasn‚Äôt going to wait to see what happened to it. I ran, heading towards the back door and bursting through it. On the other side of the road, there was the parking lot. My car was parked in the back corner, and from the looks of it, still intact. 

I kept to the back wall, desperate to avoid being seen, and continued slowly moving across the road towards my car. After a moment, I finally made it, pulling out keys and unlocking the door manually so the lights didn‚Äôt alert anything to my presence. 

Before I could get in, I looked across at the burning base and tunnel entrance to see the Greys emerge. The one that had been prisoner was floating alongside the others, levitating out of the tunnel with whatever powers they had used to tear dozens of soldiers apart. As they emerged, the disks began to shine their lights down, beaming them up into the ships one by one.

Just to be safe, I ducked down in my seat and waited to see if they would leave. After the last Grey was picked up, the disks fired off a few more lasers before rising further into the sky, suddenly blinking out and disappearing completely. As they left, a laser suddenly hit the R&D building, causing it to explode and hit me with a blast of heat.

That was the last thing I needed to tell me that this wasn‚Äôt the place to be. Turning the key, I threw it into drive and hit the gas, nearly smashing into another car when it lurched forward. I steered around it, hitting the road and flooring the pedal towards the entrance. The guard arm was down, but I smashed straight through it, unwilling to wait for it to raise. Not like there was still la guard at the gate to raise it anyway.

The flames were in my rear view for almost twenty minutes, burning into the night sky as I drove as far away as I fucking could. I came home, surprised a cop didn‚Äôt pull me over for speeding. At some point a bunch of fire trucks passed me, heading towards the base to deal with the chaos I had left behind. 

About six hours ago I walked in the door of my apartment and haven‚Äôt looked back. Typing this up just seems silly now, considering all that I‚Äôve gone through in the past twelve hours. I‚Äôve been looking out my window every five minutes, waiting to see black vans roll up ready to cart me off to some black site where I‚Äôll never be heard from again. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be lucky enough to have some aliens come break me out if they do take me, but goddamn it, they‚Äôre real. They‚Äôre out there. We are not alone. If this country is smart, they won‚Äôt try picking any more fights with [them](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/kO4XYBNkg9).

SpongeBob Lore:
The hot-tempered yet kind and sweet money-lover, Betsy Emma Krabs and the stoic yet kind Victor Joel Krabs are a poor married couple during the Great Depression. Betsy and Victor both join the Navy to fight in the war, but Betsy gets kicked out for being a woman while Victor gets kicked out for supporting her. Betsy later gets pregnant with a jolly and cheerful and business-savvy yet kind money lover named Eugene Harold Krabs (who is Mr. Krabs). 4 years later, Betsy gives birth to the sweet and innocent cinnamon roll of a crab Delia Kathryn Krabs.

Meanwhile, sassy and stupid yet kind hillbilly Mia Joanna Plankton and goofy and stupid yet kind hillbilly Gordon Randall Plankton are going to join the military‚Ä¶but then Mia gets pregnant with 12,001 kids (including Plankton). When they're all born, they're all dumb hillbillies (6,001 boys including Plankton and 6,000 girls) with 3,000 girls being tomboyish, 3,000 girls being girly, 3,000 boys being boyish, and 3,000 boys being girly, except for the one smart one - the hotheaded and impulsive and snarky yet kind and smart scientist Sheldon James Plankton (who is Plankton). Despite being the only smart child, Sheldon loved his family as much as they loved him.

Krabs and Plankton were born in the same hospital at the exact same time, but since they were in different social levels (the Krabses being poor and the Planktons being rich due to Sheldon's intellect impressing the superficial and snooty rich bitches), they didn't meet each other until they both enrolled in Seatown Academy. Despite Seatown being an incredibly kind town, Seatown Academy is practically the cruelest school in existence. But they couldn't go to Seatown Center (the kind school) due to the fact that if they didn't go, Academy would stalk and abuse them, meaning they had to go to the Academy to stay safe from worse harm.

When Sheldon and Eugene got there, Sheldon was relentlessly bullied for being a nerd while Eugene was relentlessly bullied for being poor. However, they bonded with each other in solace of their bullying. Their parents were gonna tell them the truth about why they're at the academy, but when they realized just how great of friends they were to each other, they held back.

Their friendship blossomed. They had first met in daycare as 3-year-olds and have been going strong ever since.

When they turned 18, Sheldon and Eugene got accepted into a really smart university. But unfortunately, Eugene couldn't go to that school because his family was still poor. So, Sheldon stayed at the cruel Seatown University with him, just to protect his best friend.

Sheldon later invented a computer to help with his science experiments. However, the computer later short-circuited, developing a hot-tempered, snarky, and logical yet kind and smart scientist personality. She got adopted by two strict yet loving parents Emilp Amy Bot and Fredrick Russell Bot and they named her Karen Ivy Bot (she becomes Karen).

Karen, Sheldon, and Eugene were an amazing bestie group throughout college. Eugene was there when Sheldon and Karen confessed their love to each other.

On Sheldon and Karen's third date, Sheldon and Eugene opened up Plabs Burgers. A restaurant that was repurposed from Stinky Burgers, a restaurant that was shut down by the health department for getting people sick. So, Sheldon and Karen could date while the restaurant was being run. However, when they accidentally killed a customer, the hotheaded Sheldon got in a huge fight with Eugene over who killed him. Sheldon stormed out while Karen followed after him. Karen encouraged Sheldon to go back and reconcile, because no one lets a simple argument destroy a friendship. Sheldon agrees, and they go back.

But when they got back, it was too late. When Sheldon stormed out, the perfect Krabby Patty formula was created. And Eugene stole it and betrayed Sheldon to get rich. Sheldon and Karen tried to get through to him, but it was no use. Sheldon broke down in tears while Karen carried him back to the dorm the 3 shared.

That night, Karen had an epiphany. Eugene was once genuinely Sheldon's best friend. This means that there's still good in him. She spends the rest of the night making a plan.
1. They quietly steal the formula without hurting anyone (Sheldon can't cook and Eugene will never willingly share it)
2. They tell the truth to everyone Eugene manipulated (since he saw how angry and murderously vengeful Sheldon was getting and used this to make everyone in the ocean think he's a murderer. The ocean's concerns are justifiable (since they're just trying to protect themselves and everyone else) and they always try to be nice to Sheldon when she shows a kinder side and are ready for this BS to be done.
3. They use the formula to make a successful restaurant called the Chum Bucket
4. Eventually, Eugene will redeem himself and they'll be playful rivals and best friends once more

However, the next morning, Sheldon was too far gone. But Karen wasn't giving up on getting this plan to work. She's still doing it to this day as they're married in the Chum Bucket, even when Sheldon forcefully reprograms her and stops her from telling the truth against her will and also does this to Spot James Plankton, Chip II Shane Plankton, and Giggles Jason Plankton.

Eugene, meanwhile, did this: after heartlessly betraying his best friend for money and finally being rich, he joined the Navy. However, he later got kicked out for bullying other people and fell into depression over this. He got out of it by moving to Bikini Bottom and purchasing a bankrupt retirement home called The Rusty Krab and changing it to The Krusty Krab. When it opened, he hired 18-year-old Squidward Johanssen Quincy Tentacles as the cashier, a hot-tempered and snarky yet smart, cultured, kind, and talented artist. Squidward was a victim of Seatown Academy's cruelty, and when he finally made friends in high school, they never actually loved him and betrayed him for Squilliam. This gave Squidward trust issues a mile deep. The only people he truly trusted were his family. After graduating Seatown Academy, he fled so that they wouldn't be able to abuse him. At the same time, Jim Landon Fishgelle, a chill and confident guy who always gives great advice, joined the restaurant to be the fry cook. While everyone in town was caring and genuinely loved Squidward, they were way too friendly so they were oblivious to Squidward's trust issues. Much to Krabs's chagrin, Squidward and Jim bonded immediately. Jim tried to help Squidward realize that he doesn't hate his job and actually belongs in Bikini Bottom being his artsy self and having a great found family, but it never worked. But Jim's not giving up, even as he moves away to start his dream job of running a restaurant of his own. And he also saw both the good and bad in Krabs while Squidward only saw the bad and the town only saw the good.

During Krabs's time in Bikini Bottom, he fell in love with a sweet whale named Marina Cady Blue. Despite their giant age gap, they fell in love, and when Marina accidentally got pregnant with the Pearl Annabelle Krabs (kind, girly, cheery, and nerdy. Loves pop music, cheerleading, and math.), she and Krabs got married. However, Marina later divorced Krabs due to him being greedy and cruel. Krabs then manipulated baby Pearl into thinking her mom left because of her. Now, as a sixteen-year-old high schooler at Bikini Bottom High, Pearl is an incredibly insecure nervous wreck who is kind and sweet but desperate to please her father and the mean popular kids. And her dad doesn't listen to her SO much that she has to resort to throwing superficial tantrums just to get through to him. Currently, Krabs is dating Mrs. Penelope ""Poppy"" Rose Puff, a hot-tempered and anxious and cautious yet kind and protective young woman. Puff has always been like that, but when one of her students died in a boatmobile accident, a crazy stalker manipulated her into thinking it was her fault for being too nice. Puff was forced to flee her hometown of Ocean City with her fun-loving boyfriend Harold Joshua Puff and marry him to change her last name from Swell to Puff so the stalker wouldn't catch her. Puff's world got even worse when her Harold got turned into a lamp by humans. Now, she gets incredibly nervous around her students and has to be incredibly strict, scared that they might die if she's not strict. And with SpongeBob, it's ESPECIALLY hard.

But despite Krabs being a cruel bully now, he sometimes shows unexpected kindness, showing that Karen's right about him - he DOES still have a heart.

Karen Ivy Plankton (ne√© Bot)'s birthday: December 20, 1969 at 10:00 PM in Seatown, underneath Fiji (she's 54 years old, a Sagittarius with a few traits of a Capricorn in the sun, a Taurus in the moon, a Leo in the rising, and a Rooster)
Garold ""Gary"" Gareth Wilson Jr's birthday: July 1, 2014 at 9:00 AM in Bikini Bottom, underneath Bikini Atoll (he's 9 years old, a Cancer with a few traits of a Gemini in the sun, a Leo in the moon, a Leo in the rising, and a Horse)
Pearl Annabelle Krabs's birthday: May 12, 2007 at 10:00 AM in Bikini Bottom, underneath Bikini Atoll (she's 16 years old, a Taurus with a few traits of a Gemini in the sun, a Pisces in the moon, a Cancer in the rising, and a Pig)
Mrs. Penelope ""Poppy"" Rose Puff (ne√© Swell)'s birthday: September 15, 1972 at 2:30 PM in Ocean City, underneath New York City (she's 51 years old, a Virgo with a few traits of a Libra in the sun, a Sagitarrius in the moon, a Sagitarrius in the rising, and a Rat)

Bikini Bottom: A cheerful and sweet town akin to a tropical California town. It's also somewhat magical, which isn't a surprise since Bikini Atoll is a nuclear testing site. Despite this, the town is incredibly kind and sweet.
Seatown: A sweet and sophisticated town with a sweet and inclusive school called Seatown Center and a cruel and controlling school called Seatown Academy. But other than Seatown Academy forcing people into their school, Seatown is a very amazing place. A lot like the tropical Fiji but slightly more cultured.
Galveston: A seaside Texas town with Texan flair, tropicality, country music, karate, and science.
Ocean City: A HUGE bustling and beautiful and diverse city akin to New York City.

Shelley: SpongeBob's pet scallop. Quiet, calm, sleepy, yet loyal and kind

Snellie: Squidward's pet snail. Graceful yet playful

Sebastian: Squidward's mischievous yet kind pet scallop who loves spraying people.

Clarry: Clarry, Squidward's go-to clarinet, is incredibly loyal and dependable and patient and understanding. Treated like a daughter

Woody: Woody, the wooden clarinet gifted by SpongeBob, has a warm and rich tone that brings a sense of comfort to Squidward. Playful and lighthearted (it's from SpongeBob) and treated like a son.

Rocky: Rocky, quite literally a rock, is steadfast and unmoving. Despite showing no signs of sentience, his steadfast presence is oddly comforting to Patrick. Rocky's immobility and unchanging nature make him a reliable ""pet"" in Patrick's eyes.

According to Patrick, Rocky has ""nerves of steel,"" humorously highlighting his unflappable nature. No matter what happens around him, Rocky remains calm and composed. Despite being an inanimate object, Rocky has an air of mystery. His unexplained victory in the snail race in the episode ""The Great Snail Race"" adds a layer of intrigue to his character.

Mr. Doodles: Krabs's loyal and playful pet worm

Sheldon: Krabs's playfully sassy and kind pet scallop. He unknowingly named him Sheldon because he deep down misses Plankton.

Annette: Mrs. Puff's calm and nuturing and adorable pet snail. She and Snellie actually look identical.

Mrs. Puff's 30 mischievous and protective peanut worms, with 6 being tomboys, 6 being bubbly girly girls, 6 being sassy girly girls, and 12 being flamboyant and theatrical boys

Here's an analysis of each Plankton family member based on their personalities:
1. Spot: Playful and cheery, despite being a guard dog
2. Chip: Sensitive, creative, and introspective. Despite living and working at the First Nautical Bank, he visits his family all the time.
3. Giggles: playful and cheerful. Additionally, despite being the youngest in the family, he's WAY BIGGER than Spot, his grandfather

Chip is a robot, while Spot and Giggles are amoebas. The amoebas only make dog noises, so we find out what they're saying by how they act and their expressions and noises and how people respond to them. Chip's the only one in the family who can talk alongside Plankton and Karen. Spot is Plankton and Karen's pet and therefore adopted son, Chip is their robot adopted son, and Giggles is Spot's grandson (but Spot's still young because amoebas multiply rapidly all the time). Spot, Chip, and Giggles are all part of Karen's crew to guide Plankton to the better path of just harmlessly stealing the formula (because that's their only option), telling the town the truth, bringing Krabs to justice, and Krabs will eventually become their bestie again.

All of the pets in the SpongeBob universe do not talk. They only communicate through animal noises (dogs for worms and amoebas, cats for snails, birds for scallops, and so on) and we have to find out what they're saying through those noises and their body language and how characters respond to them.
Sure! Here's an analysis of each of the Mathletes members' personalities:

1. Squidina (a squid)

‚Ä¢ Personality Traits: Shy, sensitive, kind, supportive.

2. Bubbles (a jellyfish)

‚Ä¢ Personality Traits: Cheerful, optimistic, playful, energetic.

3. Calcula (a mantis shrimp)

‚Ä¢ Personality Traits: Intelligent, focused, serious, determined, a little sarcastic and hotheaded.

4. Statistica (a seahorse)

‚Ä¢ Personality Traits: Analytical, observant, thoughtful, reserved.

Moving on to the other characters!!: SpongeBob's personality: Bubbly, cheerful, and naive yet sweet and kind.
Patrick's personality: Stupid, lazy, and short-tempered (gets offended easily because stupid) but incredibly hilarious and kind
Sandy: Tough and short-tempered and competitive yet smart and cheerful and levelheaded. Obsessed with all things karate, science, music, and Texas
Gary: Calm and quiet and a lot smarter than SpongeBob but still his best friend (but also snarky towards him when he needs to be)
Karen (hot-tempered and snarky and logical yet kind and smart scientist)

Before trauma for all these 5 characters (these above characters have zero trauma):
Plankton (hot-tempered and snarky and impulsive yet kind scientist)
Krabs: jolly and happy and business savvy yet kind money lover
Puff: hot-tempered and cautious yet kind and protective
Squidward: hot-tempered and snarky yet kind and smart cultured artist
Pearl: kind, girly, cheery, and nerdy. Loves pop music, cheerleading, and math.

Fred (the my leg guy) used to always purposefully injure his leg just to be with the tough yet kind Nurse Daisy Bazooka in the hospital she worked at. When they started dating, he stopped. But now he has Weak Legs Syndrome from constant injuries, but he has a high-pain tolerance and him and everyone else finds humor in this. He embraces himself as the leg guy.üíñüíñ

Squilvia: Squidward's girlfriend, calm and artsy, plays the trumpet
Dr. Coral: Squidward's therapist, calm and wise and understanding

Pearl's only friends in school are the Mathletes. The Mathletes just want Pearl to join them and have them all transfer to Bikini Bottom Academy, a sweet and inclusive school. But they're not going without Pearl.

Squidward's actually super talented. He only sometimes plays badly due to being burnt out from trauma and pretends to be arrogant to scare people away‚Ä¶it never works.

The parantheses are what each of these are a reference to, including the show's continuity and the pop culture references

All of the parody artists have their discography songs and albums share the same names as their land counterparts.

Just because something's not in their favorites doesn't mean they don't like it. They love it, it's just not in their favorites section. Eg: Squidward definitely loves things that SpongeBob likes, even if they're not a core personality trait. I mean, he DID get addicted to Krabby Patties in Just One Bite.

SpongeBob is asexual but capable of falling in love
Squidward is bisexual
Sandy is a lesbian
Plankton is pansexual
Karen is pansexual
Krabs is straight
Puff is straight
Pearl is bisexual
Patrick is demisexual (though he immediately falls in love with mermaids)

1kug50n,https://www.reddit.com/r/securityguards/comments/1kug50n/questions_from_an_engineer/,Questions from an engineer,"Hi guys!

Long story short I'm a software & mechanical engineer (and recent grad) who's always been interested in the first responder space for a lot of reasons. Security is obviously adjacent to law enforcement and often times is a first line of defence, so felt it'd be a good idea to post here 

With that being said, I've recently been trying to learn more about the space, the problems in it, etc. So, I was hoping to ask a few questions

1. What is the day-to-day in the life like? (Is it mostly writing, admin work, etc, what's the actual breakdown?)
2. What's the most painful/unpleasant part of the job?
3. What gets in the way of doing the job well, on a consistent basis?
4. What is the most painful recent memory you have on the job? (doesn't need to be anything hugely awful like a violent person - can literally be 'i spilled coffee on myself'!)
5. What feels like a problem that drives you crazy, that you're surprised hasn't been solved yet?
6. How does safety feel on the job? Do you ever worry if SHTF, that your guys might not know?
7. Do you feel like at any given moment, everyone knows what your up to and your status? (I don't mean general public here, more mean - do you feel like if you're in a pickle, the cavalry will come a-runnin')
8. Are you satisfied with the current state of the industry, or do you think there needs to be change? (This can be anything, equipment sucks, policy sucks etc)
9. For my seniors out there - what sucks the most about your job?
10. Again for my seniors out there - what's the hardest part about being a senior guard? Do you feel like managing other guards, etc is hard?
11. For my top level managers - what's the hardest part of what you do?
12. Do you feel like there's a question I should've asked, that I missed? Really feel free to pour your heart out here!

Hope my questions aren't too strange!",1,1748105433.0,securityguards,2,1.0,False

Need help with this one folks. How do you sort attendees for each event and create a table on a separate sheet using a formula if the events are all in one cell?

  
For example: I need to create a table for all the attendees of ""Meeting - Tuesday"" and then a separate table for ""Book Club"". I tried using the filter and query formulas but it only picks up the name of the one attending only one event.

  
TIA for the help!

Setting there watching! Looking out onto the Himalayan mountains! Looking at them seemingly as they ascended into the sky above them. Knowing that over the years, that many had fallen to their demise just trying to climb them. 

But Elizabeth‚Äô wasn‚Äôt there to climb! But she was here with a friend who will be mentioned later. For that morning setting there in Kathmandu, the air was brisk and breezy that morning in Kathmandu. For Elizabeth‚Äô and Paul‚Äô But to them it wasn‚Äôt nothing that a nice cup of hot Coffee Couldn‚Äôt fix. With her setting there seeing and feeling the coolness of mountain air making its way up to the balcony. To Where Elizabeth was setting. Setting there looking at what was to come for her and Paul‚Äô on this day.

And if she knew what was about to happen to them that day! Knowing what was to come! For as Elizabeth‚Äô was now looking straight into what was going to be there moment of knowing! Of knowing the difference in wanting to stay alive! Or die trying! With her setting there looking straight at the Himalaya Mountains! Feeling the 
Majestic  hold that the mountains had! 

Mountains that had brought many from a far just to climb them. Only to see many of them die trying, but for what as to come for her and Paul‚Äô later that day that day. Would be the mountain letting them know that their only chance of surviving would be up to them. Knowing death would be most certainly to them on that day! For it was either die trying! Or stay where they were to just die! 

Knowing that The moment! You stop! It could be your last! With her now setting there as the wind from the mountains Blew through her long dark hair. For Elizabeth‚Äô a 36 year old! Having long dark hair and green eyes! Always the being the adventurous girl that she was, always like the outdoors. But there was nothing that was going to remotely prepare her for what was to be for them on that day.

Whether it was going to be them staying put and dying, or to only try and die! For no one, not even a Professional Mountain climber. Could possibly see themselves surviving what was coming that day for them. But as Elizabeth‚Äô sat there looking out to the morning sun as it slowly climbed over on what was going to be either their demise. Or trying to survive what be the impossible that was coming for them that day. As the sun shined down on Kathmandu shining its light down through out the city. 

As Elizabeth‚Äô set there looking out from her balcony! Out into city that was just before her! Just as she would then give a quick glance, with her seeing just from out of the corner of her eye. A image of the person that was going to be! that day! A person who would survives! Or dies trying! Knowing that the one that stays where they are dies! Or try‚Äôs only to just die! For standing there just inside of a sliding glass door! Revealing the image back to her. As the image of her then looked back at her saying! 

‚ÄúAre you ready for this! For what was to be! Setting there looking at a girl! Who was looking back at her not knowing on whether, she was ready. Ready for whatever the day would bring‚Äù

Just then as her friend Paul‚Äô a blonde haired blue eyed guy! Who himself! Was a very experienced outdoorsman! But! On this day! Nothing could have prepared them! making his way out onto the balcony, looking over to Elizabeth‚Äô setting there as the wind from the mountain air was blowing through her long dark hair! 

Giving Paul‚Äô a moment of memories! Memories of them going on many adventure‚Äôs together as he stood there looking over at Elizabeth‚Äô just as he then pointed his Polaroid camera towards her saying! ‚ÄúNow give me that big o‚Äôl smile‚Äù As Elizabeth set there looking to him smiling just as Paul‚Äô was focusing in as her! As she then looked to Paul‚Äô with a smile! Just as her then took her picture! But only if they knew what was going to be for them on that day. As the photo then slowly began to come in, showing to them the Himalayas in the background. 

With the mountains saying to them in their own little way! The feeling of knowing that later that day. That him and Elizabeth‚Äô would soon be there! Just as he then placed the photo down in front of her! As he then told her

‚ÄúA picture is worth a thousand words!‚Äù As he then looked to her smiling! As Elizabeth‚Äô sat there looking at the photo of her! As Paul graciously smiled away seeing the moment in her eyes. Not knowing what was to be for them that day on Annapurna! Setting down at the table beside Elizabeth , Paul then said

‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm so ready for today! how about you‚Äùlooking over to Elizabeth‚Äô seeing her smile knowing that she was most certainly ready! 
As Elizabeth then looked at him with a smile saying to Paul‚Äô ‚ÄúOh I bet you are! The mighty photographer! going to get his pics‚Äù As she then Leaned over to Paul‚Äô saying! ‚ÄúHey I just know that You will get some really great pics! I just know it‚Äù looking up to him smiling.

But before Elizabeth could say anything else Paul replied back saying ‚ÄúThe Himalayas are just so spectacular in themselves, the grandest mountains on the face of the planet‚Äù As he then Reached over to her place in his hand on her to Elizabeth‚Äôs shoulder saying to her. 

‚ÄúAnd just to think! That the mighty mountains just ahead of us! Brought us here! But!  Now that I think about it! I could see you climbing one!‚Äù Just as Elizabeth‚Äô then said! ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so! Even though we will be flying over them soon! I like my feet just where they are.‚Äù With Paul‚Äô then giving her a Quick Look and a smile! Saying to her.

‚ÄúWell Me and you are going to get to fly over them today! And get some spectacular pics! I can just see it now! My Elizabeth‚Äô the look on her face! When we reach her! Annapurna! Reaching his hand up behind her head telling her!

‚ÄúNow we both have been friends ever since high school! Now with the both of us now setting here at the top of world. Can it get any better than this.‚Äù With Elizabeth just smiling back saying 

‚ÄúBest friends!‚ÄùAt that! As Paul then turning his head with a look and smile saying to her 

‚ÄúBest friends! So what time is the plane taking off for us! On this glorious morning for us‚Äù

With Elizabeth replying 

‚ÄúJust in a couple hours! But you may be the mighty photographer! But I have always been the one to keep us on track‚Äù

Giving Paul a little laugh and smile knowing that today was going to be very special for them. For it was a day that they had been planning for over a year now. As Paul‚Äô and Elizabeth‚Äô sat there on their balcony looking out over into the city of Kathmandu. Setting there watching as the morning sun brought its light echoing through the busy streets below. Knowing that the their plane was going to take off in just a couple of hours flying them over the Himalayas.

After finishing up their breakfast Paul‚Äô and Elizabeth‚Äô then made their way through the city to the airport. With excitement all around! For both of them had looked forward very much to this day. Not wanting to skip a beat Paul then looked to Elizabeth‚Äô Saying 

‚ÄúA little late to ask this, but do you think that have we brought everything that we need?‚Äù

With Elizabeth looking to him replying 

‚ÄúPaul! It‚Äôs only going to be for a few hours! I‚Äôm sure that we will be just fine, just as long as you did not forget the camera‚Äù With Paul then giving a Quick Look of surprise saying 

‚ÄúHad you there for a minute didn‚Äôt i ‚Äú

As Paul‚Äô then Placed his hand on his bag assuring her with a smile and quick shake of his head. As he then placed his arm her shoulder saying! 

‚ÄúNow what would we ever do without each other‚Äù

Smiling as they both then gave each other a smile looking at each other just as the driver that was driving them to airport. Let them know that they had arrived with them now getting out the car as they made their way across the tarmac. Looking ahead to the mountains not knowing of what was to come! What was going to be for them on that day. 

With them now walking up to the plane just as Elizabeth‚Äô then took one last look over to what was to come. And that was the mountains that they was going to be flying over. As the pilot then approached them. Letting them know that they would be taking off shortly! After getting everything situated that was! As the pilot then asked them. 

‚ÄúAre you ready! Are you two ready for a flight of off life time?‚Äù

With Paul replying 

‚ÄúReady as we will ever be!‚Äù

For unknowing to them at the moment! that this plane ride was going to be a plane ride that the two of them would never forget. As they then looked around the plane Paul then noticed a couple of parachutes. With Paul then jokingly replying pointing to the chutes 

‚ÄúYou think we will need those laughing‚Äù

With the pilot giving a reply back saying 

‚ÄúHey you never know‚Äù

But Little did they know that indeed they would be needing the chutes in the worst way possible. After a couple of hours of flying! they were now approaching what Paul was there to get pictures of. As Paul‚Äô and Elizabeth‚Äô set there looking out of the window looking over into the vast landscape. A vast landscape that seemed to go on forever but a brutal landscape it was! For in just a few moments they were about to find out just how brutal it was. Just then as the pilot then looked back to them saying to them

‚ÄúNow if I can get your attention! Your captain speaking here! Now if you look out in front of us! You can see coming upon us here! Is one of nature‚Äôs finest creations Annapurna herself‚Äù 

With Paul quickly grabbing his camera to get a photo just as he then suddenly had the look of terror on his face. For heading straight for them was a massive flock of birds! Leaving them with only a few seconds just before the birds would smash into the plane. Leaving Paul and Elizabeth with a look of disbelief at what was about to happen just as the pilot screamed out

‚ÄúOh my Fucking God! Hang on!‚Äù

Acting quickly with Paul then grabbing Elizabeth‚Äô holding her saying 

‚ÄúHold on!‚Äù

Just as the birds then slammed into both engines of the plane quickly sending it plummeting down into the mountains below. With them fast approaching the mountains ahead! knowing that they only had seconds to act. Acting quickly with Paul‚Äô grabbing the chutes throwing one to the pilot then looking to Elizabeth‚Äô saying 

‚ÄúLook at me! Now you are going to have to trust me! No time to argue!‚Äù As the plane was going down with no time to act! 

‚ÄúWe only have a couple of minutes till we cannot do anything at all! So I am going to need you to trust me on this!‚Äù

With emotions now running all through her! Emotions Of an uncontrollable moment! For as Elizabeth‚Äô then looked to Paul saying!

‚ÄúI trust you! Now just do what you have to!‚Äù Holding tightly onto him! Thinking that this was going to be their last moments. 

Quickly as Paul then placed the chute onto her knowing that every second counted! For one mistake meant certain death! saying to her just before he then forced the planes door open 

But As Elizabeth‚Äô then looked to Paul as the fear was taking over her! The fear of not knowing! Gripping her arms even more tightly around Paul‚Äô knowing that what was about to happen. Was now going to happen! She just looked to him saying! 

‚ÄúI trust you!‚Äù Placing her head on his chest holding him onto tight! As the was now descending faster! No more time to react! 

And with that Paul‚Äô quickly pushed themselves out of the plane and into the unknown! The unknown of what was just below them. With them followed quickly by the pilot! holding tightly onto her as the mountain rushed quickly upon them! With only seconds to act deploying the chute holding tightly onto her as the force of the chute propelled them up. 

Not knowing what was going to happen! Or if they would even survive they now begin to approach the side of the mountain fast. And hard but almost before either of them could take a breath they then slammed into the side of the mountain hard.

Looking down a mountain that most certainly meant death to them. Just then as Elizabeth‚Äô then slowly looked up to Paul still very much shaking! saying to him. Grabbing onto him! Holding onto him tightly! As Paul was looking around and down a mountain knowing that, they would be dead if they tried! And that they would most certainly be dead if they stayed! 

‚ÄúI think so! Oh my God! I think so! How about you are you okay‚Äù As Elizabeth‚Äô was still holding onto him tightly looking down a mountain. That had most certainly meant death

With Paul now looking in total disbelief! Disbelief what in the Hell just happened! As he just set there leaning back on the mountain!

(i would usually bring my own water) for the most part i didn't mind it. before and during working there.

now in 2025 i CANNOT stand scooters coffee, the matcha is never mixed correctly so its always chunky ü§¢ and the espresso and all the flavorings u can get are bitter. the blenders just taste like ice. the lemonade tastes like water and so do the refreshers. 

i've chalked it up to my changing tastebuds but idk i'm sick of scooters, it doesn't matter what i pick it all tastes bad. what makes it worse is that's the closest coffee place. 

also my dad very obviously doesn't really like it either and goes out of his way to get dunkin if we're going to the city, even if we stopped at scooters before leaving town. i think it's funny.

This situation is my own doing, and the consequences of my own actions. I also know how stupid I was in almost every decision I made in hindsight. I'm just looking to get this off my chest.

In November 2024 I ended a 6 year relationship. I had been confused for a long time and had been struggling with mental health. She was understandably upset and wanted me back, but I knew I wasn't in the right place to commit to her as she deserved.

In February 2025, contact naturally started again after she posted a love letter through my door. I knew immediately that I wanted her back, but had given myself 6 month minimum so I could mentally improve, but rather stupidly I didn't tell her that.

Contact continued regularly, as it went on it was getting to a point of messaging almost daily, but wasn't anything deep. At the end of April or start of May, she made another attempt to meet up, suggesting we get a coffee together. I didn't agree or disagree as the conversation moved on, but wanted to, however, I again thought that I was only 3 weeks away from 6 months and should stick it.

Contact continued under Sunday 18th May, exactly 6 months after the breakup. I called her and told her how I felt and that I had improved and could commit now my mental health was better. She told me that she needed time to think. After 5 long, anxiety inducing days and 2 love letters that I wrote her, on Friday 23rd May she told me that after I didn't accept coffee with her, she accepted the fact that I wasn't coming back and decided to move on. She said that although it had only been 3 weeks, it was almost as if the entire 6 months of moving on hit her all at once. With that, she didn't see the future anymore, didn't feel the connection anymore and told me no. I could see in her face that she was emotionless to me, and that it was truly over.

We have now cut all contact and I am distraught. I am so angry at myself for so many reasons. I didn't truly know what I had until I left, I thought of 6 months as some golden rule rather than following my heart, and I should've just said yes to Coffee. I would've said yes to Coffee if I knew it was my last chance.

I know all the cliches of 'there's plenty more fish in the sea' and that 'it'll get easier with time', but at the moment I honestly feel that I've thrown away my entire life. I've thrown away the amazing future I've been dreaming of for 6 years, even during the 6 months apart as I thought we'd get back together once we had grown.

I am someone who struggles very much with connection due to my neurodiversity. In the 27 years I've been alive, she is the deepest connection I have ever had, she is the only person I have tolerated for such a prolonged time, she is the only person I have not been able to easily discard from my life like I have friends, and she is the only person I felt I could truly be myself around without judgement, no matter how weird I was. We got on so effortless and felt like we were meant to be so quickly after we started dating.

I have to accept I have made the biggest mistake of my life, and move on from it, but right now I cannot see myself making that same connection with anybody else ever, and don't want to. I am crying every hour, even whilst writing this, and don't see hope.",1,1748105150.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Breakfast: carnation instant breakfast with fiber powder and flax seeds, sometimes I'll add protein powder if I know I'm not going to meet my protein goal without it. 
Or oatmeal, add flax seeds and whatever fruit I have available. To drink I have black coffee with ground cinnamon. 

Lunch depends on where I'm at. If I'm at work, 2 hamburger patties with the garden, sometimes with ketchup and or mustard, or a side salad with either a cut up hamburger patty and thousand island or chicken with either lite Italian or honey mustard, or 2 scoops of chili sauce and ranch. Water to drink. If I'm at home quinoa with beans and a variety of spices, an orange, water to drink. Sometimes pasta with tuna, horseradish, and shredded cheese. This is also occasionally dinner lol.

Dinner is usually chicken and rice casserole, broccoli either in or on the side or a southwestern bowl with either rice or quinoa, black beans, corn, tomatoes with chilis, dal with naan and rice, tuna pasta with a veggie, or bean and rice burritos with tomatoes. Water to drink.

my mom gets mad/annoyed easily. when she gets mad, she also tends to blow up a lot of the time, which to me is her yelling and/or punishing. the issue i have is that she withholds ‚Äúi love you‚Äù VERY easily. even if it‚Äôs over the smallest things. 

for example, yesterday i made leftovers for my breakfast. i have two dogs who would absolutely eat anything straight away if they had the opportunity, so when i needed to use the restroom i closed my bedroom door behind me. 

while i was in the bathroom, i heard my mom open my door checking for me. then i heard her yell at one of our dogs. i remember rushing out and asking if he had eaten my food, to which my mom said yes. i asked her why she let the dog eat my food (you could very clearly see my food in my room. you could also hear my dog eating it from the restroom because of the silverware against the plate.) she said she didn‚Äôt let the dog eat my food (the plate was licked clean when i came out), and that i was the one who left my door open? i told her i knew for sure that she was the one who left my door open, but she kept denying it and telling me it was my fault. i didn‚Äôt argue about it, it would‚Äôve gone nowhere. however, when she left for work, i noticed she didn‚Äôt say i love you. when she‚Äôs in a good mood and she leaves the house, she always says i love you. i remember texting her that i loved her and i hoped that she had a good day at work. no reply back. i know she saw my message. 

last night she invited me out to coffee with her and her friend. she also said me and her could go shopping afterwards for stuff for my room and plants. i obviously said yes. she told me that we‚Äôd be leaving at 8:30. completely fine by me. 

i remember being woken up at 8:00 with my mom telling me i had 30 minutes to get ready. i went to the bathroom, did my thing, she calls my name. please note that i had literally just woken up, my eyes hadn‚Äôt even adjusted properly yet. i open the bathroom door and she jumps out and tries to jokingly jump scare me. i laughed a little, but i really couldn‚Äôt share the same energy. i tried to make a joke about it, saying: ‚Äúi‚Äôm not in the mood right now but-‚Äú which made her blow up again. she starts yelling ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù and starts calling me disrespectful and rude. 

i didn‚Äôt know what to do. it was so sudden, especially since i thought she could tell i was making a joke in the moment, but she didn‚Äôt even let me finish it. 

i automatically assumed i wouldn‚Äôt be coming with anymore, and i was right. i remember she came into my room a little bit before she left. i said, ‚Äúi love you,‚Äù and all she said was ‚Äúsure.‚Äù 

then again, when she actually did leave, i said i love you. no response. just the front door slamming. 

i don‚Äôt know how to navigate this. these are just two very recent examples, but this has been going on for years. it‚Äôs getting to the point where i want to do something about it, negative or positive i don‚Äôt care. i‚Äôm tired of this. sometimes my mom will tell me that she loves me, but she doesn‚Äôt like me. now it just seems like both. 

i don‚Äôt want this to be the norm, and i don‚Äôt want this to keep going any longer. i need help. i feel so lost about it all. i want to do something that‚Äôll make the situation better, whatever it may be. any advice is really appreciated, thank you.",1,1748104904.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Long story short I'm a software & mechanical engineer (and recent grad) who's always been interested in the first responder space for a lot of reasons. The biggest one is that it's such a high and positive impact field, and I want to help change the world for better.

With that being said, I've recently been trying to learn more about the space, the problems in it, etc. So, I was hoping to ask a few questions

1. What is the day-to-day in the life like? (Is it mostly admin work, etc, what's the actual breakdown?)
2. What's the most painful/unpleasant part of the job?
3. What gets in the way of doing the job well, on a consistent basis?
4. What is the most painful recent memory you have on the job? (doesn't need to be anything hugely awful like a bad car accident - can literally be 'i spilled coffee on myself'!)
5. What feels like a problem that drives you crazy, that you're surprised hasn't been solved yet?
6. How does safety feel on the job? Do you ever worry if SHTF, that your guys might not know?
7. Do you feel like at any given moment, everyone knows what your up to and your status? (I don't mean general public here, more mean - do you feel like if you're in a pickle, the cavalry will come a-runnin')
8. Are you satisfied with the current state of the industry, or do you think there needs to be change? (This can be anything, equipment sucks, policy sucks etc)
9. For my senior medics out there - what sucks the most about your job?
10. Again for my senior medics out there - what's the hardest part about being a senior? Do you feel like managing so many officers is hard?
11. For my chiefs / dep chiefs - what's the hardest part of what you do?
12. Do you feel like there's a question I should've asked, that I missed? Really feel free to pour your heart out here!

Thank you guys for your service! Been lucky enough to (so far) have not needed to call an ambulance in life, and hope to keep that up, but know that if I have to, will be in good hands :)

He paid for my purchase without saying anything to me (I didn't know he was doing it) so when I got to the register the cashier waved me past and said the officer had paid for them. 

I felt grateful and happy about this. I yelled thank you so much after him and even made a post about it on my (very small) city's subreddit. I ended up deleting the post and my comments in it. (The post had like 65 upvotes when I deleted it). This was because 1) I realized I didn't want people connecting my account with any personal info about me and 2) people were posting stuff like ACAB and police domestic violence statistics in the thread and it really made me kinda paranoid about the interaction. 

Thinking back I'm wondering if the police officer recognized me. I didn't get a good look at him but his hair looked like the hair of a guy who did a wellness check on me before, it is kind of distinctive. Maybe it was some kind of signal that he is watching me or surveilling me. 

I generally am not one to be super trusting of police and I feel like I made a mistake posting that thread, the response I got turned my view of what had initially been a positive interaction into something I'm feeling paranoia and suspicion over.

1kuft2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1kuft2y/like_a_disco_librarian_ds_durgas_radio_bombay/,"""Like a disco librarian"" - DS & Durga's Radio Bombay | Margiela's Jazz Club","Like, a year ago, this sub helped me out with a reccomendation request:  
*Non-binary and in my 30s, looking for a warmer scent that's like vinyl records, coffee shops and disco. The funkiest librarian you know. Gender*ful¬†*rather than genderless. Worn semi-regularly to be approachable.*

And u/seaintosky, u/Solution-Proof and u/LLIIVVtm all came through with their selections - D.S. & Durga's Radio Bombay and to look into the Maison Margiela taster set.

Since then I've grabbed taster sets of both houses and have bought and worn Radio Bombay and Margiela's Jazz Club for a while. I thought it would be good to give my thoughts and findings, and thank folks for taking the time to give me suggestions. I am very new to fragrance and don't have all the terminology, but hopefully it's still useful.

**Jazz Club**

This was much easier to get hold of, so I got this first and had the most time with it. Definitely my favourite of the Margiela sample set; many of which leaned towards being light and friendly, but kind of insubstantial. Jazz Club is still very friendly, but less of what I'd call 'light'.

The sweet, boozy fragrance is really clear without being overpowering, and there's a more mature, leathery smell when it dries down that gives this impression of 'your skin but better', like makeup that doesn't change your appearance, just smooths it out. I don't really smell the tobacco, but as a fragrance designed to be accessible, I'm not surprised that it's not prominent. It lasts long enough with 1-2 spritzes to feel present for the start of an evening, and more intimate in distance after that. I could probably go 3-4 spritzes and have it last much longer, but I'm wary of overdoing it haha.

My go-to wear now for evenings and social activities though I wouldn't be reluctant to wear it somewhere more serious.

**Radio Bombay**

Oh man, it's a good thing D.S. & Durga is generally praised and has it's really strong music-themed branding to hook me in, cause I had to both do a bit of travelling and spend a lot more than I would normally on cosmetics/toiletries to get hold of it. And I definitely don't regret it - it's a scent I like a lot! But it has also opened up the plausibility of spending over ¬£100 on a fragrance, which I've (alas) done since.

Y'know how in cocktail bars the drinks that are less sweet and more alcohol prominent are called 'Serious'? Radio Bombay feels like the Serious variant of Jazz Club. It's got the spiciness and woodiness, but it's not sweet at all, and has a bit of a sharper smell. Focused, rather than hazy. It smells *expensive* which is apt!

However, I struggle to pick out exact ingredients/objects in it which is possibly my own inexperience, but it also means that it's more abstract to describe. It makes me think of a well-used but very tidy crafting workshop with unvarnished wooden tables. To that end, it lingers *very* well on paper and fabric. Possibly bizarre but it's an excellent pencil case/craft box fragrance.

Because it feels like it means business, it's solidly become my daytime office fragrance. It's definitely not like anything I smell on other people day-to-day, and I really appreciate that.

**Closing Thoughts**

While I don't aim to be a fragrance collector in any serious way, finding these has been both affirming of my own personal style, and got me interested in finding fragrances to match other aesthetic vibes I like to wear. 

I found out about Jusbox's Beat Cafe today, though I don't think I need to own *three* scents with a similar profile. I've also never had anyone comment on my changes in fragrance which might just be British politeness. A little bit of a shame, but ultimately I'm doing all this for me.

In that same request post I also asked about an artifical *in*human fragrance. I am yet to get hold of the suggested CdG Odeur 71, but I did do some self-research and ended up getting Xyrena's Neon Sunset which I could post about in future once I've worn it a bit more.

1kufri4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLE/comments/1kufri4/question_from_an_engineer/,Question from an engineer,"Hi guys!

Long story short I'm a software & mechanical engineer (and recent grad) who's always been interested in the first responder space for a lot of reasons. The biggest one is that it's such a high and positive impact field, and I want to help change the world for better.

With that being said, I've recently been trying to learn more about the space, the problems in it, etc. So, I was hoping to ask a few questions

1. What is the day-to-day in the life like? (Is it mostly tickets, admin work, etc, what's the actual breakdown?)

2. What's the most painful/unpleasant part of the job?

3. What gets in the way of doing the job well, on a consistent basis?

4. What is the most painful recent memory you have on the job? (doesn't need to be anything hugely awful like a bad car accident - can literally be 'i spilled coffee on myself'!)

5. What feels like a problem that drives you crazy, that you're surprised hasn't been solved yet?

6. How does safety feel on the job? Do you ever worry if SHTF, that your guys might not know?

7. Do you feel like at any given moment, everyone knows what your up to and your status? (I don't mean general public here, more mean - do you feel like if you're in a pickle, the cavalry will come a-runnin')

8. Are you satisfied with the current state of policing, or do you think there needs to be change? (This can be anything, equipment sucks, policy sucks etc)

9. For my senior officers out there - what sucks the most about your job? 

10. Again for my senior officers out there - what's the hardest part about being a senior officer? Do you feel like managing so many officers is hard?

11. For my chiefs / dep chiefs - what's the hardest part of what you do? 

12. Do you feel like there's a question I should've asked, that I missed? Really feel free to pour your heart out here!

And finally, thank you guys for your service. I realize being a first responder (especially LE) is really unforgiving, but I like to think most of us appreciate and understand the importance of what you guys do.

I'm a 51m by the way, so it's not like I should have know. But as I reflect on my life, on the things I do, yeah, I'm really scared of being alone. I've been working on this for the past 2.5 years, about the time my twin sons were graduating and leaving for college. For context, I've been working from home for the past  9 years. Still, my FOMO has been around since, well forever, and I know the exact moment my traumatic experience created this fear in my brain. I'm working through resolving that. I do things, like constantly have youtube playing, or I'm constantly listening to a podcast, I go work from coffee shops, I'm constantly scheduling things to do with people. Heck, I even got a dog 8 years ago. For my kids for sure, but mostly me. I don't like to think about him being 8 because the thought of him gone just kills me.

ANYWAY I digress. 

Something I've noticed is that - from Season 1 to 8 so far - Sam tends to clear his throat a lot, but in a really natural way that I find soothing and nice. I don't know if this is something Ted Danson was directed to do for the character, or if it's something he did as himself and he just incorporated it into the character... but I just love that he is always so organically clearing his throat. I can't explain it, it just adds this realism to the character. Like how he is often chomping on nuts or pretzels, the way the characters drink water or alcohol so naturally... all their mannerisms really. I just love how organic the show looks and feels. 

It's why I loved Frasier so much tbh, not just the obvious brilliance of the show but the organic way the characters would sit and drink a coffee together and talk to each other. Little nuances like that in fiction make it feel more real and believable when you see characters doing little things like that.  

  
Anyways I suppose my main point for making this post was to ask if anyone else really noticed this much and if anyone knew if it was an intentionally done character thing or Ted just incorporating his own throat clearing into the performance. Either way I love it. ",9,1748104421.0,Cheers,1,0.85,False

I know that a Cottage Food Operation doesn't allow for selling from something like a stand unless it's at a farmers market, but what if the stand is at my front door?

Have you ever truly pondered the mystery of how two strangers can become such close friends over something as simple as sharing a favorite coffee shop table? I was sitting in this cozy spot the other day, watching people come and go, and it hit me‚Äîthese tiny interactions hold so much power in shaping our lives.

Maybe it's the comfort of knowing we're all just trying to make sense of our own little worlds. Idk, but there's something magical about how a 'hello' or a shared smile can plant the seeds for connection. As someone who spends way too much time with her nose in a book and coffee cup in hand, I often wonder about the stories behind the faces I see. We're all just passing through, connected by these fleeting moments.

I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who finds the beauty in life's small, shared mysteries. It's like we're all pieces of a much larger puzzle, figuring it out one cappuccino at a time. ü§î",5,1748103904.0,dearUnknowns,0,1.0,False

1kufinp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1kufinp/ex_reached_out/,Ex reached out,"Hey guys,

So i am struggling at the moment because my ex reached out to me after me going in to no contact for 6 months.

To give you a backstory; she was a struggling addict and just never kind to me, when i reflect back on it and after doing much Needed therapy i saw why i wanted to save her because that is a woud that i have in me from childhood and i am finally starting to love myself after 34 years wandering this earth.

So i got a message: Hey how have you been, after going through therapy i reflected on a lot of things, and i was wondering if you would be open to grabbing a coffee together.

This came out of leftfield because you know when they say: they always come back when you let them go..


Well thats what happend, i finally said to myself you have you‚Äôre version of the story and you knew you tried everything to communicate and connect with this woman.

2 days after that i got the message, and i was profoundly dumbstruck. It felt like a test from the universe to check if i would live out that truth.

So my response was: Hey i am happy you are doing good, and i am good to. It is not that i am not open to meeting up, but before that i would really like your intention for this meet up, because clarity would help.

I got a message back, but it was mothersday and i tried to entertain my mom and not be with my head on the clouds on a day for her. (Yep you guessed it, the wound started with my mom)

I tried reading it that night, message deleted..

I was so angry because it was a flasback to our relationship dynamics, me stepping one foot towards her and her running away.

Then 2 days later i get a whole paragraph about she talked to much about the intention and she finds it hard talking via text, which i fully understood and again i did what the other person wanted. I said let‚Äôs call and then talk about it. 

‚Äò‚ÄôBut i really want to know your intention, because i am go to be honest i have a weakness for you‚Äô‚Äô is what i texted her last. 

2 hours later phonecall:

She wanted to apologize and how she started that was: so look i am sorry but you lied to me.. i was like wtf here we go again‚Ä¶

I let her finish her statement and said this is why i need to choose me and you need to choose you, because again you are calling me a liar where i was not. 

‚ÄòSo i have a weakness for you but no we are not going to meet for the coffee.‚Äô

I felt like it was part of the twelve step program, like she needed to make her excuse as a checkmark like okay got him who is next, no sincereness no empathy..

And know the final weirdness of it all, now i am blocked haha. Again everything comes out left field with her. As i am typing this it explains it a bit.

But i like to hear your thoughts, opinions, questions.

Kasi yung body clock ko hindi ko binabago kapag weekends kasi gusto ko nang tuloy tuloy yung tulog ko kasi feeling ko masama if pabago bago sya or kulang kulang tulog mo or interrupted in between.

Ano ginagawa nyo para maging productive weekends nyo? Like when you end your shift on a Saturday morning, hindi na ba kayo natutulog para buong araw may time kayo? Hindi ba mahirap kapag walang tulog?

1kuffry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kuffry/toxic_psychologist/,Toxic psychologist,"Hello, I'm writing this from a coffee shop while I take a drink to process what just happened to me.

I recently contacted a Spanish psychologist who has his office near the Eiffel Tower. I wanted a person who spoke Spanish to be able to deal with the aggressiveness of the city and its chaos.

Before leaving for the consultation, my bicycle chain broke, I fixed it as best I could but my hands were a little dirty, so I stopped for a moment to wash them (without soap) and then try to remove the grease with a tissue. I was a little late but I arrived at the exact time with a lot of effort.

When I arrived at his office, I told him in a very natural way what had happened to me, hoping to open a conversation based on the unforeseen events of life, but when he saw me like this, he reacted in a slightly aggressive way and told me ""with those hands I can't let you into my office."" I explained to him that I would have stopped at a bar to wash my hands but I wanted to get to the office on time. He responds by saying ""you are an adult and you should have solved this problem sooner"" then goes on to tell me in a very weird tone ""GO and wash your hands"" like when an adult talks to a child. I told him that as an adult I understand the fear that I might get something dirty and that I wouldn't touch anything with my hands. While he was answering me, I saw his office and it looked like Richard Bateman's apartment, everything in its place but in an excessively neat and strange way and this made me freak out, I am a very intuitive person and immediately my brain felt that I was in front of someone who was too particular.

Anyway, since we put psychologists on a pedestal I told myself ""suddenly you are exaggerating and oversizing everything so try to give a logic to all this and put yourself in his position"", he tells me again ""are you going to wash your hands, can you go down to a bar or not?"" And I told him ""If you give me some time I can go wash my hands at the bar on the corner"" he accepted and closed the door. While the elevator arrived, I started to think and felt uncomfortable with a person who gave me a bad feeling. I knocked on his door again and told him ""I prefer to cancel the appointment"" and he told me ""why?"" And I could simply answer him ""because I find your attitude bizarre"" and he said ""whatever you want"" and closed the door.

I wanted to analyze the situation, I understand that there are normal conditions to enter an office, what upsets me was that supremely authoritarian, almost humiliating tone, his energy, his strange office, also when you go to see a psychologist you expect a little empathy and in these unforeseen events even more, perhaps I am somewhat to blame (even though I don't think so) for not having found a solution but that is not the way of doing things on the part of a professional. For my part, my bicycle/universe saved me from falling into the hands of this guy.

I am writing this because fortunately I am not in a very complicated mental space, I simply wanted to talk to someone about the difficulties of living in another country, but I was a bit worried to think about the people who are mentally fragile and who fall for these types of psychologists who in the end are other human beings sometimes with great power of domination and who can be crazier than a goat. Psychologists can also be giant redflags. Be very careful out there.

For those who live in Paris, the initials of this psychologist are P P.

It started with a visit to Traverse City, MI to tour the old buildings that remained in their abandoned state. While gearing up for the tour, I had a delicious BLT at Red Spire in the basement and found a hospital postcard at the bookshop. Summer and fall would lead me to buffalo and WNY for a whole week and subsequent weekend because the week simply didn't offer enough. On that weekend, and just minutes before an expanded tour of the Richardson Olmsted, I was this piece of patient art from Buffalo State Hospital at a local antique shop. On the way back, I stopped for the night in Athens, OH just to catch a glimpse of the former state hospital on the college grounds. The first couple floors are open for gallery space and are free to the public. The upper floors are alarmed but staring up the stairwells, I could see the crusted paint up there and the adventurer in me died a little inside. Many of the details in the building have been lovingly preserved and the art gallery was fantastic. Time didn't allow to visit the cemetery but still amazing that I got to visit all these places in just a year; and two visits to one no less. What a wild ride. ",1,1748103610.0,Asylums,0,1.0,False

Summer is ""here""ish. My whole summer is totally jam-packed. A trip to my moms next week, a fiber festival the weekend after, father's day weekend (which I need to figure out what Im doing), a 5 day adventure to Southern Oregon.. finally I get a weekend off, then its 4th of July, my anniversary vacation, and then we finally get a few weekends of chill before we go back to back again in August, and my big 2 day adventure at the giant fiber festival in Seattle.

I might be obsessed with yarn and fiber. I had a nightmare last night I was crocheting in the car, and I dropped my favorite hook and somehow it fell out of the car entirely and got crushed by the car behind us. Only made funnier that I dropped it right as I was asking my husband if he minded if I bought more hooks. As soon as I dropped it he said ""well apparently youre buying more now."" Even in my dreams, he's still the most supportive husband I could ever ask for.

I've been on a spending freeze, or more accurately ""only spending if it doesnt come out of my bank account"" freeze so I can hoard money like a dragon and go hog wild at Flock in August. What better way to end the summer than dropping 1,000 on yarn?! Theres totally nothing unhinged about that at all. Still cheaper than crack.

With the fiber festival in two weeks though, I really want to get some projects finished so I can devote some time to spinning. I wound off the first ounce, the fiber I started spinning after I caked my first bit was so much better than my first attempt. Definitely makes me feel better about it. Spinning isnt as easy as it looks.

Im trying to categorize all the projects I have, and set goals to finish. I just need to not overdo it or I'll end up in the brace for the 3rd time this year. Moderation was never my forte. If I can get the wedding present done this weekend, I can make good headway on my daughters blanket, and my socks. Socks will probably come with me to southern Oregon, because theyre small. I really need to finish what I have before I start more, but the list of things I want to make is insanely long. And of course I have yarn for all of it.

I think we need a fiber anonymous meeting. Its a problem.

But, in true Saturday form, husband got up with princess and let me sleep in. He didnt make me coffee so that probably means we are going to Dutch. I got catch up on the YouTube videos I missed over the week and theyre watching old Disney movies.

I didn't sleep well, woke up at 1am ready to start the day. Did some thinking before I fell back asleep. I feel guilty? But not? I feel like I should be much more upset. I just ... dont? Besides being a bit confused by the toddler style temper tantrum that entered my inbox yesterday, I just ... I cant say I dont care, obviously I do. But I'm completely at peace with whatever outcome happens. Would it be sad to never have my friend back? Of course. Its not the outcome I want. But if I dont get the outcome I want, there's nothing I can do about it. Its out of my hands, the decision is not mine anymore and I'm alright with that. Hopefully he can find that same peace with his choices.

Its a really freeing feeling, actually. Even as things got heated yesterday, and things were being said with the intention to hurt and upset me, it just didn't phase me. I could see it for what it was. In or out, I offered the olive branch and that's all I can really do. Now it's time to accept the outcome and keep going.
