1jkrqhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BritBox/comments/1jkrqhh/the_tower_question_about_the_phone_spoilers_inside/,The Tower - question about the phone ... (SPOILERS INSIDE),"I thought 'The Tower' was top notch overall, and especially liked Gemma Whelan as Sarah Collins. But there's one plot point that is just bothering me!  This relates to Seasons 1 and 2; have not yet seen S3 (so no S3 spoilers please!).

In Season 1 of The Tower, Hadley (the big cop) stole Farah's phone from her when he learned that she had the recording of him making the racist remarks. He hid it in his locker.  Later, we learn that DI Shaw (the Irish cop) retrieves the phone from Hadley's locker in order to protect him.

Fair enough.  But in E3, we learn that he still has the phone; he brings it to the meeting with Lizzie Adama and she hears the recording herself.  And at the conclusion of that meeting, DI Shaw still has the phone, and has to hide it in the coffee cup when he sees that the cops are at his home (and then it ends up in the hands of his wife ... I'm guessing S3 will reveal more but I'm not there yet).

So my main question is - WHY did DI Shaw keep the phone? Why didn't he destroy it as soon as he retrieved it from the locker? It was nothing but trouble. 

Also (less important question but still a mystery) - how did Hadley get the phone from Farah? Did he make a special visit to her, just to steal it from her? And if so, why wouldn't Farah go to another cop to complain that this guy stole her phone? And did Hadley specifically call DI Shaw to ask him to get that phone from the locker, before the incident at the tower?",1,1743036588.0,BritBox,0,1.0,False

She had coffee thrown on her and around the clinic, was threatened (that she would blow up the clinic), and was also racially abused (which I believe in this context should constitute a hate crime- told to go back to her country and that she’s an Indian b*tch). 

My mom’s secretary called the police immediately and an officer took my mom’s and a witness’s statement (another patient who was in the waiting room). He didn’t give her a case number which I thought was odd but when I found out what happened, I called OPP and was able to speak to him and get the number.

I also found out that the patient is being charged with (sorry for the non-legal language- I don’t recall all of his exact words): assault with a weapon, 2 counts of assault (she pushed her twice), vandalism, and threatening. He said she agreed to surrender herself today and is being held since she has a prior assault charge (her ex murdered a man and she I believe helped with the coverup!). He said the judge will decide tomorrow morning what happens and if she will be out on bail. I said we want to charge her for a hate crime too, but he said that will be up to the crown based on the statements my mom and the witness gave about the racist language the patient used during the assault. 


My question is…what next? 

-I’m very confused, and to be honest, have little faith in the Canadian justice system. Is it likely that based on her prior charge, she will get jail time? 

-And if so, for how long? I’m frustrated at the idea that someone who is violent and a threat to society could once again be let out, and I would appreciate some clarification into what the likely outcome is of this? Is this woman likely to face *any* legal repercussions besides a slap on the wrist and probation? Losers like this have zero care about what their record says.

My commercial tenant (small upscale corner grocer and caterer) has begun to fall behind on rent payments for the past few months and is making small partial payments. Their insurance coverages have lapsed as well. From my perspective, it seems like they are prioritizing payments to their bank for their construction loan and paying us what they can when they can.

As of today, they still owe almost $2,000 just for March and April is rapidly approaching. We don't want to pursue legal channels unless absolutely necessary. We are more focused on keeping this tenant in the neighborhood (previously a food desert) and trying to help their business grow.

I worry that they are going to collapse on themselves and we would like to have a positive and effective discussion on how they can capture more revenue. The problem is that this tenant is abrasive, sensitive, and not usually open to feedback. They are a very tit-for-tat personality.

For instance, the tenant's bank insisted that ridiculous rent escalations be included in the first lease. After construction concluded and before the first escalation took place, we offered to lower the escalation schedule, which gave them a savings of $30,000 over 6 years. However, the original lease expired a year ago and I have not yet given them a new one due to personal health issues (which is totally my fault and I am just as frustrated with myself as they are with me). We are also a family run business and have been overwhelmed with lots of our own very serious business woes and projects over the past 5 years.

The lowered rent escalations were signed and attached to the lease. Major terms are not changing in the new lease and they know this, but they have refused to pay the increased rental rate (an additional $200) that went into effect a few months ago until they get the new lease. I'm not going to lie, I feel a bit snubbed by this considering we didn't have to lower the rent escalations at all. They technically owe more than the $2,000 right now due to the shortage of the $200, but we have let that slide for now as a concession for not giving them the lease.

Anyway, we want to give them some feedback to them, but we are sure it will be received poorly.

Our recommendations:

\- Extend business hours. They currently open at 10 AM. We have another tenant, a luxury doggy daycare, in the same complex that begins drop offs at 7 AM. The daycare's clients are high earning professionals that have money to burn and need coffee and snacks for their day. The problem tenant is completely missing out on capturing this business.

\- Some of their food is just not good at all/downright terrible. They are very healthy/vegetarian/vegan geared. My parents are home chefs who have won tons of cooking awards/contests. We would be more than happy to share our recipes with them.

  
I don't know. I just don't want them to fail and I obviously am worried about being able to pay my own mortgage and insurance if they fail. Anyone have any advice or have been in a similar situation with a commercial tenant?",1,1743035847.0,Landlord,3,1.0,False

I've been playing Elder Scrolls Online with a group of older guys (I call them Xbox Grandpas) for the past 10 years. They've been with me through good and bad, and when l've been pregnant (twice since knowing them) they've thrown virtual baby showers (with in game gifts) as I had no one in real life to do so. This summer l'm going on a road trip to meet them.

I need help finding/designing gifts! We have a ton of inside jokes.

Blankets would be a good option for all of them as I don't know their clothes size and who doesn't love a blanket? But l'm not sure on designs!

The easiest is: I need a compass where every direction is south! This grandpa and I give one another the most (affectionate) shit. We have a very antagonistic relationship. He plays in Cyrodiil (on Red only: Red or Dead!) and spends a lot of time standing on Chalman with his lancers. He loves making gold but doesn't like to spend it.

One grandpa made a joke so now we always say
""Heavy Sack on (Gamertag): He is a sweet guy with a chaotic, golden retriever energy. His wife (Xbox grandma but she doesn't play she just says hi sometimes) is also adorable but that's an aside. He's a bit distractible and is always starting fights when we are trying to travel because he can't help himself. He is an optimistic pessimist (says things like 'oh, we are gonna die' with a cheery tone.
He's just here to have fun.

The third grandpa/uncle (he's not quite old enough to be my grandpa so he refuses lol) is always leading the pack. He gives us crap about it but he's the only one who knows what's going on. With the other four of us (myself included) it's like herding cats). Out of the game he gives me a lot of life advice and tries to help me manage being a SAHM of three kids in a foreign country. He encourages me to take care of ""my kids mom' because I can't take care of them if I don't take care of me.

My fourth grandpa/uncle (also not old enough) loves Oogie Boogie so something Oogie Boogie parody would be great - and he never has enough transmutation crystals. He loves chaos and doing something new.
Any links to Etsy or other sellers who might be able to help would be greatly appreciated! Suggestions for ideas, memes that I might be able to work with, etc.

Not in weakness, but in warmth. The kind of woman who wraps her love around the people she cares for like a favorite blanket, always there, always comforting. I’ve dreamt of tending to a home that breathes gentleness, where every room hums with quiet care and smells faintly of sweet vanilla. The kind of scent that clings to memory, wrapping around your shoulders like a hug the moment you walk in.

I want to be the wife who rises early to make coffee just the way he likes it, steam curling in the air before the sun fully wakes. The wife who knows when it’s been a hard day just by the way he sets down his keys, and without a word, pours a glass of his favorite whiskey, setting it beside him like a silent reassurance: I see you. I know.

I want to cook meals that bring the family together, where the table isn’t just a place to eat, but a space to share, to laugh, to slow down. A home where everything has its place, where needs are anticipated, and nothing is ever really lost because love keeps it all in order.

And I want him to feel that love always, day or night. To know I am fully his, in every way. That he can find love not just in my heart, but in my body, in the way I give, the way I respond, the way I adore him without hesitation. That in our most intimate moments, he is deeply wanted. And I’ll cherish the way he gives himself too-his heart, his hands, his body. Making love something we both become.

That’s all I’ve ever wanted.
To give that kind of tenderness.
To live in that kind of love.

And though it hasn’t come to me yet-though the days pass quietly without it, I still believe it’s out there, making its way to me just as I’ve been waiting for it.
Maybe a little slower than I hoped.
Maybe arriving in its own time.

Jumped at the first offer I got, a guy I briefly worked with during a stint at a shit job. I always knew he was something of a druggie, the city is notorious for that as well. Not meth or something but party drugs. I knew I was in for trouble when he one day comes home and tells a story making him out to be the victim- he had just shouted at a woman on the subway who responded ""rudely"" when he asked her to move aside. I was stunned he came across looking worse in a story told from his perspective. Showed this guy can't really be reasoned with.

Now his hair trigger temper aside, this guy is just loud. Incredibly loud. The walls are thin and I hear every sound when he's yelling on this phone, talking to himself (he does this a lot) laughing maniacally at something he sees (like screaming laughing) sneezing incredibly loudly, blowing his nose, hawking spit after doing a line of ket or coke, telling me something at least 3 or 4 times a day when I'm home. He at least doesn't play music when I tell him I'm working or I have a meeting or.i need to sleep but I can't stop him from doing everything else. 

I work remotely and he was recently fired from the shit job I met him at, for losing his temper several times. So I'm around him a lot more. And it's getting unbearable. He deals drugs a bit to get by and that means guests. My relationship with my girlfriend has run its course but she's clinging on and I'm delaying the inevitable with her just to have a place to get away to a couple night a week. I've had to work more frequently at cafes to escape the noise and at this point I'm spending more than I'd like on overpriced coffee. Finding a room let alone a flat in the city is absurdly competitive, and my network of friends isn't quite extensive enough to find a place through.

between the noise, temper, drug addiction and messiness I could tolerate one, maybe 2 - but all at once it's just a horrendous mixture. The thing is generally we get along ok - I wouldn't mind him as a friend I see on a night out every few months - but this close I just can't.

It’s really weird I’m only 9lbs away from my ultimate goal. I wanted to lose all of it by May, but I’m just going to do what I’ve been doing and know the weight will eventually come off.

I truly feel so much better but large weight loss isn’t without cons. I still feel chunky sometimes. I have loose skin. Certain parts of my body are deflated and sad. My back and neck pain is actually worse? I will be treating myself to a mommy makeover when I’m 30 LOL. 

But overall the pros outweighs the cons. To anyone else who may be around my before weight, it is possible to lose the weight! Give yourself time, grace, and figure out what works for you!

Part 3: The morning air is thick with warmth, carrying the scent of damp earth and sulphur. The steam rising from the ground makes everything feel heavier, like the town itself is breathing. I rub the sleep from my eyes, trying to shake the lingering unease from the night before. The sound of breathing—was it the wind? A dream? I’m not sure anymore.

Koro is already up when I step into the kitchen. He sits at the small wooden table, staring out the window with a cup of tea cradled in his weathered hands. His fingers are wrapped too tightly around the cup, his knuckles slightly pale.

""Morning,"" I say, grabbing a cup for myself.

He hums in response but doesn’t look away from the window. I follow his gaze—just steam drifting lazily through the trees, the same as always.

Something is off with him. I can feel it.

""You sleep okay?"" I ask, sipping my tea.

He takes a long time to answer. ""Dreams can be tricky things, girl. Best not to dwell on them.""

I frown. ""I never said I had a dream.""

Koro doesn’t reply. His grip tightens just slightly on his cup, and he takes another sip of tea, his eyes still fixed on the mist.

I need to get out of the house. The weight of last night’s unease still clings to me, and Koro isn’t helping. So, I walk.

Golden Springs looks even smaller than I remember. Most of the town has been reclaimed by nature—grass pushing through cracks in the pavement, trees growing too close to the road. A few houses have lights on, but most sit empty, paint peeling, curtains drawn tight.

It isn’t a ghost town. Not yet.

But it feels close.

I stop outside a small café—the only place still open. The bell above the door jingles as I step inside. The scent of coffee and baked goods mixes with the damp, musty smell of old wood.

Behind the counter stands a familiar face. Han. We used to go to school together. He’s taller, leaner, but his face still holds traces of the boy I once knew.

His eyes widen slightly when he sees me. ""Evelynn?""

I offer a small smile. ""Hey, Han. Long time.""

He wipes his hands on a cloth, glancing toward the back of the café as if making sure no one else is listening. ""Didn’t think you’d ever come back.""

""Just visiting Koro,"" I say, stepping up to the counter. ""How’s the town been?""

Han exhales through his nose, shaking his head. ""Same as always. Just... quieter.""

I grab a coffee and a small pastry, paying quickly, but as he hands me my change, I feel it again.

That **prickle**.

Like someone is watching.

I turn slightly, scanning the empty café. Nothing seems out of place, but the feeling doesn’t fade.

Han must notice my unease because he hesitates before speaking again. ""Marama... she used to feel like that too.""

I tense. ""Marama? Your sister?""

He nods, voice lower now. ""She had nightmares. Said someone was following her. She was convinced of it. And then..."" He glances toward the fogged-up windows. ""She disappeared.""

A cold weight settles in my stomach. ""What do you mean, disappeared?""

He hesitates, then sighs. ""Just... be careful, Evelynn. People talk about the estate taking folks, but there’s no proof. Just whispers.""

The estate. That damn estate. I wondered if they had expanded more. Driving to Golden Springs, I had noticed massive gates with symbols on them. Strange—so strange.

I swallow, gripping my coffee a little tighter. ""Thanks for the warning.""

I turn and leave, stepping back into the humid air. The steam curls through the streets, moving unnaturally, shifting around the buildings like it’s alive.

That’s when I see him.

A figure dressed in grey, standing about a hundred meters away.

Motionless. Watching.

I freeze, my grip tightening around the coffee cup. My breath comes slow and shallow. The figure doesn’t move. I take a step back. Then another.

He follows.

I turn and walk faster. My pulse pounds in my ears. I glance over my shoulder—he’s still there, keeping his distance but never stopping.

By the time I reach Koro’s house, I’m almost running.

I bolt the door behind me, heart hammering. Peering through the curtain, I scan the empty road outside.

No one.

I let out a shaky breath before grabbing a bag and shoving a few essentials inside.

Checking in on Koro, I force my voice to sound steady. ""I’m going for a hikoi. I’ll be back later.""

Koro doesn’t look up from his tea. Just gives a small nod, as if he already knew I’d be going.

As if he expected it.

I hesitate for a second longer, then turn and step back out into the mist.

I follow the stream, its surface shifting with the heat rising from the ground. The further I walk, the denser the mist becomes, curling around my ankles like grasping fingers. My feet crunch against damp earth and scattered stones as I trace the water’s edge, searching for… what? Clues? A sign? Anything to explain the growing unease pressing against my ribs.

The world feels smaller here, swallowed by the fog, sound muffled beneath the steady gurgle of flowing water. That’s why I don’t notice right away.

The fence.

Tall. Rusted. The iron bars stretch high above my head, vanishing into the mist. Symbols, unfamiliar yet unsettling, have been carved into the metal, some newer, others so worn they bleed into the rust. My pulse quickens. Without realizing it, I’ve wandered onto the estate’s grounds.

A shiver crawls up my spine. The air here feels different, heavier, thick with something I can’t name. I turn, ready to retrace my steps—but then I hear it.

A low whisper.

Not words. Not quite.

The wind? The trees shifting in the breeze?

Or something else?

I step back, heart hammering, but the whisper comes again—closer this time.

Then the figures step into view.

They stand just beyond the fence, their clothes pristine, their eyes glazed over with a white, unnatural sheen.

Marama is among them.

My breath hitches. She looks straight through me, unblinking. And she isn’t alone.

The mist twists around them, thick and cloying, sticking to my skin like damp fingers. The air is wrong—too still, too hot. The figures beyond the fence stand motionless, yet their presence presses against me like a weight on my chest.

Marama’s lips part first. A slow, deliberate movement, like a puppet on invisible strings. The others follow, their mouths opening in eerie unison.

And then—the whispering.

It crawls into my ears, slithers beneath my skin. Not words. Not voices. Something deeper, older, twisting and coiling in a way that makes my bones feel hollow.

My breath hitches as a shape shifts in the mist, something bigger, watching from behind them.

And then they step forward.

I don’t think—I can’t think. I run.

The mist blurs around me, my heartbeat a frantic drum. Behind me, the whispers rise, twisting through the air like fingers reaching for me.

I don’t dare look back. I can feel them closing in.

And I know, without turning—

They are right behind me.

I ran.  
I didn’t think—I couldn’t think.  
My body moved on instinct, feet pounding against the dirt, breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps.  
The air felt thick, wrong, like it was pushing against me, trying to slow me down.

But I didn’t stop.  
I burst through the trees, past the broken fences and overgrown paths, my legs screaming, my lungs burning. Koro’s house—there.  
Just beyond the next rise.  
I didn’t care if I was loud, if I looked insane—I needed to be inside.  
Now.  
I reached the door and slammed into it, nearly fumbling the handle in my desperation.  
My fingers trembled as I twisted it, throwing my weight forward.  
The door flew open, and I stumbled inside, nearly collapsing.  
With shaking hands, I turned and shoved it shut behind me, twisting the lock with a sharp, metallic click. Silence.

Only the sound of my breathing—ragged, uneven, animalistic.  
I pressed my forehead against the wood, squeezing my eyes shut.  
The cold from outside still clung to my skin, but inside—it was warm.  
Safe.  
No whispers.  
No figures with empty eyes.  
No towering shape bleeding from the mist.  
Just home.  
My knees buckled.  
I turned, moving on autopilot, my limbs sluggish, my body heavy with exhaustion and fear.  
I made it to my room before my brain even caught up, before the reality of what had just happened could sink its claws into me.  
The bed.  
I lunged for it, yanking the covers over me like a child.  
My heart thundered so hard I could feel it in my throat.  
I squeezed my eyes shut.  
If I don’t look, it can’t get me.  
If I don’t look, it’s not real.  
The blankets were warm, cocooning me, shielding me from the world.  
I was safe. I was safe. Right? …Right?  
reaching for my laptop I thought that writing would be the best way to unfold it all and look at it.   
Was I being delusional, was this my mental health playing a trick on me?   
Or is this really happening.   
It was terrifying. I never had experiance anything like it guys.

Time: 53 minutes and 42 seconds 

Small talk exchanges are undoubtedly an unavoidable part of life. Even though it is unavoidable, there are some benfits of small talk that benift both parties of the conversation. For example, it can allow workers to get a promotion and to build close friendships.

It is no wonder why very few people get promotions at work. Only 0.1 billion out of 3 billion workers attempt to make small talk with their coworkers. Jamie Terran, who is quoted in ""The Awkward but essential Art of Office Chitchat,"" by Lindsay Mannering in the *New York Times*, says, ""..building rapport through interaction with colleagues could be the thing that gets you the promotion or keeps you in the role you're in,"" (Source A). Here, Terran agrees that when someone interacts with colleagues, it allows that person to have a stronger chance on getting a promotion. Mannering also mentions, ""People hire people they want to work with, not necessarily who's perfect for the job. Engaging in small talk with your interviewer helps make a positive impression."" (Source A). Mannering made an important point that in order to do well in the workspace, the worker has to be good at talking which means that he or she has to be good at small talk in order to make a positive impression. Therefore, it is needless to say that small talk is the key to getting a promotion or a good job in the workforce.

Small talk is one of the ways genine friendships or realtionships can be created. For example, Janet Homles from her book of essays ""Doing Collegiality and Keeping Control at Work: Small Talk in the Governemnt Departments,"" mentions, ""...workplace the exchange of greetings, complaints about how busy life is, promises to get in touch for lunch, coffee and so on, are examples of small talk tokens that serve this positive politeness function,"" (Source B). Homles mentioned that when someone will make these small greetings, it creates a politeness between the two parties that can evolve into a friendship. As well, according to a Pew Research Center study of teenagers' mobile-phone usage that surveyed 625 mobile phone users, aged 12-17, 51 percent- the biggest percent on the mosaic graph comapred to 28 percent to report where the person is or 11 percent to text about school work- of people text someone just to say hello and chat several times a day. In other words, more people have small chats on the phone compared to any other reason. These small chats help people stay connected even through mobile phones. To add, Roberts David, writer of ""Why Small Talk Is so Excruciating,"" writes, ""Which means if you hate and avoid small talk, you are also, as a practical matter, cutting yourself off from lots of meaningful social interaction, which is a bummer,"" (Source E). David, depsite being against small talk, admits that social interaction is the key to meaningful, geniune, friendships. Therefore, small talk is one of the only ways in order to gain real realationships.

Some might argue that small talk is worthless and just annoying. For example, Sofia Warren drew a piece named ""*Small talk Vortex,*"" that was featured in the *New Yorker* magazine. This artwork illustrates how small talk is a ""vortex"" in the panel with a graphic weight on the vortex in the middle and on the lady dress who tries to leave the men who are saying very general small talk terms such as ""Great weather we're having!"" Overall, the piece attempts to allude to small talk being an unavoidable, anxiety-enduring mess that everyone should stay away from. However, this is wrong because people need to learn to treat small talk as if it is a way to lighten up his or her day and does not have to be anxiety-enduring. As Mannering says, ""repurpose your anxiety about making small talk with your co-workers and worry instead about not making small talk with your co-workers"" (Source A). Here, Mannering is saying that small talk is only anxiety-inducing if someone makes it to be. Therefore, there is no reason why small talk has to be a ""vortex,"" and should be instead considered as a positve thing in someones day-to-day life.

Overall, it is important for everyone to realize that small talk is human nature. Without it, people wouldn't be able to gain promotions at work or gain friendships that last a life time. Next time someone tries to avoid small talk, he or she should consider all of the oprtions he or she are most likely losing out on.

I deleted the text as it was impulsive and didn’t have the level of care I would want to reengage with. Anyway, she texted back anyway long after I’d deleted saying she wasn’t ready to meet quite yet, but suggested we get coffee next month.

Could there still be any kind of hope here? I’ve been doing much better since the breakup and enjoying getting to know myself and grow in independence.

Tom blinked as the sensation of warm liquid soaked through his shirt. He looked down to see dark brown coffee staining the crisp white fabric, the same way it had countless times before. The young woman gasped, clutching an empty cup, her face a mask of mortification.

""Oh my God, I am so sorry!"" she exclaimed, just as she always did.

Tom forced a chuckle, falling into the familiar script. ""Don’t worry about it. Consider it my war trophy for the day.""

Her nervous laughter followed, and Tom smiled. He had long since given up trying to change his response. It didn’t matter; no matter what he said, the next week, she would spill the coffee again, and the cycle would repeat.

Monday bled into Tuesday. He helped the UPS guy with the oversized package up to the fifth floor, nodding at the predictable ""Man, you just saved my back!"" The conversation unfolded word for word as it always did. Wednesday brought Elinor’s birthday party, a slice of cake with too much frosting, and a chorus of off-key voices. Thursday, the dreaded morning meeting, where Bob droned on about efficiency metrics. Friday, the casual dress day, when his old tee-shirt and blue jeans felt like a small rebellion. Saturday, overtime, the empty office humming with fluorescent lights. Then… nothing.

Sunday never came.

Tom had tried everything. He had stayed awake past midnight on Saturday, but always, without fail, he would wake up on Monday morning to the same coffee spill, the same apologetic woman, the same war trophy.

Weeks turned into months. Maybe even years. He stopped counting. He stopped questioning. He simply lived within the loop, learning to ignore the strange repetition like someone growing accustomed to a background noise they could never turn off.

Until one day, something changed.

It was a Thursday morning, and Tom was in his usual meeting. Bob was droning on about the quarterly performance review when Tom felt something peculiar—something he had never felt before in all the countless repetitions.

He felt… light.

Not in a good way, not in a euphoric, weightless manner, but in the way a loose thread feels moments before it is tugged free from fabric. The sensation rattled him. His grip on his notepad loosened, and for the first time in forever, the pen slipped from his fingers, clattering onto the table. Bob stopped talking mid-sentence. The room fell silent. Eyes turned toward him.

""Tom?"" Bob’s voice was uncertain.

The air itself seemed to hold its breath.

Tom bent down to pick up his pen, but as soon as his fingers brushed it, the room flickered.

No. Not the room—the world.

A brief moment of darkness, a static-like fuzz along the edges of reality, and then he was back, sitting upright in his chair. Bob was still talking, but something was off. He looked around, his heart pounding. His coworkers seemed frozen, their eyes unfocused, mouths moving soundlessly. The air shimmered, like heat waves rising from asphalt. He blinked hard, willing it away, but it didn’t stop.

And then it hit him.

This wasn’t real.

None of it was.

The sensation of slipping intensified. He gripped the edge of the table, as if anchoring himself. His mind raced. If this wasn’t real, then where was he? What was this place?

He closed his eyes, trying to think, trying to remember—

And suddenly, he did.

A car accident. Rain slick on the pavement. Headlights too bright. A horn blaring. The crunch of metal folding in on itself. The sharp, final jolt of impact.

He had died.

Tom gasped, his eyes flying open. The office was gone. The meeting was gone. Everything was gone.

He was standing in a vast, featureless white expanse. He turned in every direction, but there was nothing. Just an endless, quiet void.

A voice spoke.

""You’re ready now.""

Tom whipped around. A figure stood before him—neither man nor woman, neither old nor young. Its presence was familiar and yet completely alien, as if it had always been there, waiting for him to notice.

""Where am I?"" Tom asked, his voice hoarse.

""You were in the waiting room,"" the figure said. ""A place to help you process.""

""Process what?"" Tom demanded. ""I didn’t even know I was dead!""

The figure nodded. ""That was the point. You weren’t ready. People need time to come to terms with the end of their stories. Some stay longer than others. But eventually, everyone moves on.""

Tom swallowed hard. ""Move on… to where?""

The figure smiled, a sad, knowing expression. ""That is for you to decide.""

The world around him rippled. In the distance, shadows formed—places, faces, possibilities. Tom saw a glimmer of his childhood home, the laughter of people he had once loved. He saw a path leading into light, one leading into darkness, one leading into something entirely unknown.

He took a breath. This time, when he stepped forward, the choice was his own.",1,1743034011.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

1jkqta2,https://www.reddit.com/r/VelocityFrequentFlyer/comments/1jkqta2/my_experience_flying_united_as_velocity_gold/,My experience flying United as Velocity Gold,"Hey everyone,

For any of you Gold/Platinum members considering flying United to the US, i thought I’d share my recent experience flying MEL-LAX-IAD last week. TLDR; it was surprisingly solid.

I’m Velocity Gold (but then again who isn’t these days) and the trip was booked as a Velocity reward redemption.

- Velocity gold members get United “Premier Access” for free. It’s a product United typically sell but was added to my booking around 24 hours before departure free of charge. It formalises priority baggage, boarding and security (only applicable at big United ports in the US) in their system and is very handy.
- Departing Melbourne, i knew i had access to the SQ lounge, even though the lounge attendant was super confused when i showed up. She eventually let me in after i showed her my digital Velocity gold card. The lounge itself isn’t anything special but the coffee is excellent and it’s a little nicer than the terminal.
- Gold members don’t get any special seating privileges so I could only choose from the basic economy seats that were free of charge 
- If connecting at LAX, gold members can use the Premier Access security lane which is a lifesaver at peak periods. I had a 3 hour transit but would have missed my connection without it, even though immigration only took 5 minutes (wtf right)
- The United Club at LAX T7 is also basic but has pretty good views, free booze (ETA: only really useful before your long haul to Australia …. and even then I’d avoid alcohol entirely) and decent food selection; which is critical because there’s no food at all on your connecting domestic flight. The system didn’t automatically let me in on boarding pass scan, the lounge agent had to do something manually which involved writing down my Velocity number. Although the policy is that you can only use the lounge when transiting to/from Australia, i got the sense that it’s not strictly enforced - but YMMV
- Priority boarding is also super useful at LAX as overhead bin space is a massive issue. Gold members should be in Group 1 but United have about 6 different passenger cohorts who “pre-board” so it’s not as impressive as i initially thought 

For a non-alliance status partnership i think VA have done a pretty good job of ensuring their elite frequent flyers are well looked after by United.

Happy to answer any other questions if you like.

I was pretty set on the BenQ TH575 but then had a look at the throw calculator and the brightness results scared me a bit.

The projector would be in the basement which is basically blacked out apart from what bleeds down the stairs during the day, which is very minimal. 

While keeping my TV console, the height available under the wood beams would be 50"" (which would be ideal as I don't really have space to put it anywhere else) but removed, I would have 66"" available.

It would ideally be placed behind the couch, roughly 125"" to the wall. I could also ceiling mount it on one of the beams about 90"" to the wall. As there's not much celing height, I'd like to avoid that if possible less an accident happen when standing up. It could also be placed on the coffee table much closer to the wall but that would mean I'd have to move around either cables or consoles before and after use every time to avoid clutter. This is something I'd be willing to do however if that means that I stay within the budget I set myself.

According to the throw distance calculator, my ideal setting would lead to roughly 250nits which would be very high brightness and might ""blind"" me considering the ambiant darkness. All the options I looked at seem to have the same issue. Would the eco mode help against that or maybe any other setting? If not, do you have any other recommendation?

I live in Canada and projectors seem quite pricier over here, I set myself a budget of 800CAD before tax. It would be mainly used for movies as well as some gaming, I do play fps from time to time but nothing competitive, mostly RPGs and open worlds. 

Random list of other options I looked at in my budget: Epson Home Cinema 1080/2200 and EpiqVisionFlex CO-FH02 (could not find input lag info), BenQ HT2150ST (refurbished), Optoma HD146x (read about the low quality control so crossed it off the list). The used market in my area is pretty dead and 1080p projectors are quite expensive if you take into account the lack of warranty and the higher risk of equipment failure or piece replacement.

With all that in mind, please help me make the right call!

Still waiting Medicaid to come through. As such i have been taking only on anxiety meds (Gabapentin), as needed. I’ve been looking into herbal tea as a way to just temper my anxiety now and again. Well last night I decided to put some coconut oil in my chamomile tea to make it a bit more potent (NB: I didn’t have any of my meds last night). I gradually started having stomach discomfort. I later read that coconut oil can cause that. Well later in the night I couldn’t fall asleep. My anxiety was through the roof. I had a mild tension headache and my fingers, face and legs were numb and tingly and would get worse whenever I was falling asleep. Because of this i got zero sleep. I felt off. And while I felt somewhat better today my stomach is a bit sore and I get subtle occasional cramps. The body numbness isn’t bad but it’s still there. Yes I regret adding coconut oil to my loose leaf chamomile tea but I figure coconut oil goes on salads or in bulletproof coffee so it must be edible.

I went to college today, and during the seminar class, a girl I barely knew asked to sit next to me because there was another person creeping her out (dunno the exact details, but it was an older man who kept staring at her. I know this because I saw him staring at her profusely during a previous class). She basically directed the convo the entire time and we ended up talking for a couple hours and going out for coffee after the class ended. We exchanged contact info and I went home after that.

It then started occurring to me that she's at risk of being attacked by that guy (or anyone else for the matter, since she commutes to a pretty densely populated area for work). It's putting me in a quasi-hypomanical-stressor situation because I get loud thoughts that I need to stop them and I can't stop interpreting these as metaphysical signs of brutality. These are not hallucinations since I'm taking my meds and usually voices sound completely different from this. I start laughing and whispering to myself whenever I get these thoughts (it's been happening for the past two hours) for some reason and I don't know why.

I have made a full recovery, but I still had moments of rage. Not uncontrollable rage, but I get pissed by mildly frustrating things.  Talking with my neurologist, he prescribed be lamictal. I have been on it for two and a half months. I can definitely tell its working. Frustrations have become fleeting angry thoughts in my head now, that don't last long. But neither does being happy. Infact, I don't even have a fleeting happy thoughts like I do with angry thoughts when I get mad.

I used to love music. Like Jazz. Rock. Rap. I used to love listening to WFMU, the independent radio station. I used to love to paint. I was so excited to paint tabletop miniatures. I play a tabletop game with my brother and his friends; I wanted to surprise them with their characters that I painted. I haven't touched the miniatures or paints in weeks. I used to love playing video games. Now all of that is gone. I come home from work, lock myself in my room and watch youtube. But I might as well be staring at a blank screen, because its just on in the background as I sit in the dark and think. I used to watch this guy, ""History for Granite"", but now I can't concentrate to watch videos at all, even his. Its heartbreaking, because I used to find him so interesting.

At work, everything is an act. I remain quiet and I feign emotions. No one has noticed a difference in me.

My memory is absolutely terrible. I have suffered from eating disorders in the past. When I get depressed, its hard to be hungry, and I will often have to make sure I eat. However, the other day when I took Lamictal, it made me really sick and I realized when I thought about it, I hadn't eaten anything in 3 days. like literally nothing, but coffee and water, and I wasn't hungry.

I believe people when they say Lamictal works for them. And everything I am experiencing, people say they are experiencing. Like, I know its working, but I don't understand how anyone is happy with the way this makes you feel.

I feel like Lamictal has freed me of rage, but it has also robbed me of happiness.

I guess, when you think about it, would I rather having moments of controllable rage? Or do I want to feel numb for the rest of my life? Its like a choice; ""do you want your sh\*t sandwich hot or cold?"" I don't like that ultimatum.",1,1743033348.0,lamictal,0,1.0,False

1jkqiew,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jkqiew/help_me_decide_my_1st_setup_1000/,Help Me Decide My 1st Setup [$1000~],"Hello! I know this topic is very common but still wanted to ask some of yall opinions. Maybe things have changed after few years. I have finally decided that I would like to invest in an espresso machine setup since I do drink coffee pretty often.

At first of course I was tempted to get the Profitec GO due to the look, PIB, build quality and more consistent temperature, but wanted to see if you guys recommend any other machine that could either save me more money to invest in accessories/better grinder or if you guys believe this machine is worth the investment.

Here are the **machines** I've been recently looking at.

1. **Profitec GO**
2. **Gemilai Owl (G3006)**
3. **Breville Bambino**
4. **MiiCoffee Apex V2**

Gaggia Classic Pro was also an option but I'm new to home machines so modding seems intimidating

And here are the **grinders** I was looking at:

1. **Baratza Encore ESP**
2. **DF54**
3. **Baratza Sette 270**

I enjoy milk drinks more so the steam wand is pretty important to me but will crave something like Espresso Tonic/Iced Americano/Etc. I will most likely make drinks for my girlfriend and I so I wont be in a rush to make multiple drinks.

Regarding to bean type, im still figuring it out lol, but I will just say medium.

If you guys could choose/recommend me a combo what would your personal choice be? Also how important is Pre-infusion for lattes? If I understood correctly, most of the machines above don't have that feature.

  
Some of these combos will exceed over $1000, but that is fine. I don't need the best of the best, but Coffee is bit of a hobby of mine so eventually would like to learn more and go deeper into the realm. So if the GO is the winner then okay xD

Rhidi laid against her pillow and slowly let her eyes course down her golden chain of duty, all while her thumb played along the surface of the fist holding the broken dagger.

After she and the rest of the Kafya had received their chains, it meant that none of her training Company had shirked the responsibility. The Pwah had stayed due to their rogue noble, the Kafya due to her, and the Lilgara stayed just so they wouldn’t bear the shameful mark of being the only off-world race to refuse.

A great, crackling bonfire had been lit behind the sword and spear, casting warm light and deepening the shadows around them. The firelight danced along the broken shards of old weapons and metal within the sword and spear statues, glimmering in the flickering blades of flame. Rhidi and all the other troopers reaffirmed their creeds in the glow of the bonfire, as well as their newer oath.

The moment had been nearly ethereal, a surreal, feverish dream as her energy supplements were going offline. She barely remembered getting back to the barracks, having gotten transport on a cattle car with the rest of the successful recruits… but the oath she remembered quite clearly.

She spoke quietly to herself as the words of Senior Drill Sergeant Fairymoss came back to her mind, still as crisp as the first time she heard them. “To the cries of the innocent, I will always answer.”

Rhidi ran the large pad of her thumb down the golden fist of the emblem, tilting her head slightly as she kept whispering. “From the heavens I blaze a trail to their salvation.”

“With blade and bullet, I will carve away the taint of the wicked.” Rhidi said breathily, running her thumb pad down the broken dagger. “With open hands and compassion, I uplift the worthy wounded.”

Rhidi slowly put the chain over her ears and back around her neck, swinging her legs over the side of her bed. “My body is my honor, my armor my virtue, my weapon my redemption. I am a guardian to the righteous, and remembrancer of the twenty turned to ashes.”

Every time she repeated the oath, it always sounded so much like an apology, or a declaration of purpose. She knew full well it was not the fault of Humanity for failing to save those twenty races of the stars; Humans couldn’t be *that* fast, that direct, yet they still took the shame upon themselves as a whole.

Rhidi stood and opened her locker as everyone else buzzed around her, enjoying the Sunday after their graduation ceremony. Within her locker was her very own UAA service uniform, still as perfect as they day she wore it. The Humans, ever doting on their history, still used the service uniform from their second “world war”, a uniform nicknamed “pinks and greens”. The uniform had a smart looking dress hat made from leather and wool, cut at the sides and tailored to fit her ears.

The Humans had even gone as far as to make dress paw-shoes for the Kafya, enlisting their moon-based AI to craft paw-boots made with scaled leather plating to look the part.

Rhidi had felt extremely smart in the uniform, both her and the other Kafya looking at themselves in the mirror with broad smiles on their faces. It was odd for them all to be wearing such old fashioned clothes, and both Rhidi and the other yellow Kafya kept getting asked by the Humans to “cat walk”.

Rhidi most certainly did *not*, instead enjoying how her hat looked with a jaunty little tilt to it.

The ceremony was brief, since they still had more schooling to do, and was recorded for their families back home. It was a hard ask for the off-worlders to ship their families to Earth for a simple ceremony, so they would instead have to make do with the recording.

For some odd reason, a lot of Kafya were now arriving on Earth for schooling, and Rhidi had not received an answer from her parents after sending them her graduation video.

This was not uncommon, as it turned out, as many of the other Kafya were getting a lot of radio silence from their own families. They had already braced for it, though, as they figured they would get cut off from the other Kafya as soon as the elder councils found out about them *not* returning.

Some of the Kafya with mates back home had already put in packets to get them to Earth, which was causing *quite* the kerfuffle in the Inner Dolcir Coalition and kept the Human officials quite busy. There were even rumors of wives and husbands being kept in ransom as the elder councils demanded more answers.

Rhidi was mulling over that little tidbit as she closed her locker, turning to see Private Morris rolling something around in his hand, and her tail gave a light swish; She had seen him doing that ever since graduation, and he had been acting cold to his family when they came to visit him.

She had nothing better to do, so she slowly padded her way across the tile towards his rack. Rhidi had been trying to come up behind him as quietly as possible in order to get a peek at his hands, but he closed them before she was even within ten feet. Humans had excellent senses about them, better than any creature she had ever seen, actually.

“Morris?” Rhidi asked politely, instead stepping up beside him and leaning against his rack. “Are you okay?”

Morris drew in a deep breath, his left fist clenched around the thing she had been trying to get a peek at. He blinked a few times, then leaned backwards as he cleared his throat. “I’m alright, Rhidi.”

“You say that, but you haven’t been looking very… *happy*, since graduation.” Rhidi said, rolling her shoulder along his rack so she was fully facing him. “And you have been quite… in your own head, if you would. You’ve been quieter than usual.”

Morris let a small smile break along his clearly pensive face. “Watch me a lot, do you?”

“No.” Rhidi answered quickly, blood instantly flowing into her ears and face. “It’s just, I know how you normally are and it isn’t this.”

“All I’m hearing is more evidence for the *watching* thing.” Morris teased, though his face couldn’t hold the smile for very long. The smile faded, and Morris sighed out through his nose. “I just got some bad news, that’s all.”

Rhidi’s tail gave a deceitful wag; Morris was confiding in her, and this pleased her. It meant he trusted her a little bit, and that made her rather happy.

“Bad news?” Rhidi asked, coming around from the side of the rack and instead squatting down in front of him, resting her elbows on her thighs; Kafya could rest in this position for quite awhile if their knees were together, like they were now.

“Yeah.” Morris said with a twitch of his lips. “Turns out my plans didn’t align with someone else’s.”

Rhidi tilted her head, confused, and Morris opened his clenched hand; Resting on his palm was a simple silver band.

“... I don’t understand.” Rhidi said, reaching up with a hand and taking the, very warm at this point, silver ring. “Did someone give you this as a warning?” Rhidi’s neck and arm fur rose up sharply as another thought crossed her mind. “A threat?”

“No, it’s not a threat.” Morris said with a chuckle, smiling as Rhidi’s yellow fur slowly relaxed. “It means I am being refused.”

Rhidi’s eyes widened, though her tail did give another ominous wag. “You were married?!”

Morris laughed, a natural laugh that dragged the sadness away from his face, and he reached over to take the ring back. “No, merely in the opening phases. I had, stupidly, asked her to marry me before I left. We had been dating for nearly three years, and I thought the action would solidify my devotion to her.”

“And she…?” Rhidi asked, and she reached back to actually grab her tail to stop it from trying to wag.

“Apparently, did not agree. I should have known something was up when the e-letters stopped, and she had given my family the ring an hour before they left to come here.” Morris said, a bitter edge to his voice. “My poor mother was bawling the entire way here, and my sisters are furious. It put a huge damper on their visit.”

Rhidi narrowed her eyes; Who the hell wouldn’t take Morris as a mate? There was nothing wrong with him, no diseases, he was strong, handsome, what was this other Human’s deal?

Morris saw Rhidi narrow her eyes, and leaned forward onto his own knees. “It’s alright. If anything, I may have dodged a bullet. Besides, I cheered mom up when we went out to dinner.”

“How did you cheer her up?” Rhidi asked. “I always had trouble cheering my mom up, all she wanted to do was dress me in clothes and have me look at possible suitors with her.”

Morris exhaled a laugh through his nose at that, then flexed his fingers in a shrug. “The restaurant we went to had a little dance floor, so I bribed the manager to put on some music and I danced with her in my uniform.”

The word was, oddly enough, foreign to Rhidi, and it took her a minute to remember what the hell “dance” ment. She thought hard, and could only remember that the image correlated to the word had two Humans moving awkwardly, as if frozen in time.

“What is dance?” Rhidi asked, then shook her head. “Dancing, what is it?”

It was Morris’s turn to narrow his eyes. “What is dancing? You’ve got to be shitting me, Rhidi.”

“What?” Rhidi asked, holding out her own hands. 

Morris let out an incredulous scoff. “Dancing! You know, moving the body in certain ways with a partner or by yourself, following a pattern of movements to replicate… you know, a *dance*!”

Rhidi, for the life of her, could not understand what the hell the Human was talking about.

“Kafya don’t dance?” Morris asked, then snorted. “And here I thought it was only cats...”

“Anfilid!” Rhidi called out, spotting the brown female Kafya walking by, and waved a hand over. “Come here!”

Anfilid obeyed, striding through the racks and lockers until she was beside Morris’s rack.

“What’s up, Rhidi?” Anfilid asked, tucking her hands in her pockets and giving her brown, patterned tail a few swishing wags.

Rhidi pointed a finger gun at Morris while looking up at Anfilid. “Do we dance?”

“Dance…” Anfilid murmured, closing her eyes as she too tried to find the word in her memory. “Had the image of the uh… two Humans standing all weird?”

Morris was astounded, crossing his arms as he looked around. “Cyril!”

“Whaaat?” Cyril drawled out, as the yellow haired, yellow eyed Pwah was deep into  his data-slate.

“Pwah dance, right?” Morris called out to him.

Cyril snorted. “Of course we dance, we still have a monarchy for fucks’s sakes.”

“Dancing is a form of submission and domination in Pwah culture.” Rhodil said, being a prince in Pwah culture, but a mere Private now. “Some forms of dance are even forbidden to non-royals, you know.”

“We Lilgara alssso dance.” A passing Lilgara said, her arms full of her dirty laundry. “But it isss only for finding a mate, or wooing the opposite sssex.”

Rhidi and Anfilid glanced at each other; Both of them knew that they had never known a Kafya to dance, let alone indulge in random bursts of movement. The closest thing to dancing was maybe melee combat, but that was not really something a Kafya did for pleasure. Such things were judged as a waste of time by the elder councils, as why bother learning a useless pattern of the feet when there was knowledge to be obtained, and breakthroughs to be broken. 

Now that Rhidi thought about it, she had never seen a single program or recording of dancing on her Kafyan deltad device.

“Here, I’ll show you.” Morris said, standing up and moving past Rhidi. “Shorsey!”

Shorsey’s freckled face popped out from around her locker, her eyebrows drawn together and face in a light snarl. “What?!”

“Come dance with me for a moment, the Kafya have no idea what it is.” Morris said, kicking off his boots and setting them next to his rack.

Shorsey grimaced. “Oh c’mon man, I told you that in confidence!”

“Come on Shorsey, you’re the only one in here who I know can waltz.” Morris said, coming to an open area between the walkways and the racks. “Just do a simple box-step for me.”

Shorsey growled in her throat, looking murderous, but slammed her locker shut and stomped over towards Morris. She kicked off her boots, took off her uniform top, then came before him.

“Are we doing an underground waltz or a slow?” Shorsey asked, tossing her uniform top onto a nearby rack rail.

“Let’s go with a slow waltz.” Morris said, and he held out his arms. “No need to make the Kafya wonder too much.”

Rhidi watched the angry, red-orange haired, freckled female Human *change*; Her back arched slightly, and her face composed itself as she took Morris’s hand. Her other hand draped along his shoulder, while his came to the small of her back.

“Hey, Kubrick, give us something we can dance to.” Shorsey said, looking over her shoulder to another Human trooper who had skin the color of milk… when he wasn’t sunburned to hell.

Kubrick sniffed, then started to whistle out the Vampire’s Waltz.

The two began to… *move*, with slow, deliberate, elegant steps.

Blood began to slowly flow into Rhidi’s ears as she watched Shorsey and Morris make a *lot* of eye contact, as well as twirl, flow, and step around this little empty space in the barracks. They went through several moves, showing the Kafya underarm turns, open rolls, slowly turning in place with their arms pressed to each other…

Rhidi and a lot of the other Kafya had to swallow and look away; There was a lot of intimate touching in dancing, it seemed, and the body language was easy enough to understand. Even the waltz was getting Rhidi a little hot in the neck, though Anfilid looked on with perked ears and a dreamy smile.

“He makes her look so pretty…” Anfilid said, leaning back against Morris’s rack. “Treating her like she’s special… as if terrified of letting go completely.”

Morris spun Shorsey a few times before they came back together, and the woman gave Morris a playful shot to the stomach; She had been smiling the entire time they had been dancing, but the old Shorsey quickly came back when she had enough of being treated like a piece of glass.

“Alright, enough of that.” Shorsey barked out as Morris deeply laughed, though she did not stop smiling. “I won’t be having anymore of *you* making me look like a dainty flower.”

Morris drew down his laughter, then looked towards Rhidi as Shorsey sauntered off to retrieve her uniform top.

Rhidi was staring straight at him, and when he smiled at her, her tail gave a mutinous wag.

“Must be too sexy for the Kafya.” Alias said from his own little seat on someone’s top bunk. “Kafyan society has been trying to streamline themselves forever now. After all, why bother with getting hot and heavy while dancing when you can just do the dirty and get to the end point.”

Rhidi and Anfilid glared at Alias, though he wasn’t wrong; Marriages in their culture were little more than contractual, and children were born with a kindred efficiency. Everything had been fine before the Humans came into contact with the Kafya, but now there were rumors that the younger Kafya are stressing the elder councils.

The rest of the day went by smoothly, though Morris was too busy getting poked at and made fun of by his fellow male troopers to have any more time with Rhidi.

With graduation out of the way and them all being proper, bonafide UAA infantry, their true training came the following Monday: Heavy Onslaught Infantry and drop pod training. They had to first earn their armor, then learn to fit themselves and get used to the forces of a drop pod.

Monday started off with an entire day of physical fitness, one that the Kafya and Pwah would call “wet day” since they never stopped sweating the entire time.

Heavy Onslaught Infantry required more muscle than regular infantry, their bodies needing to be bulky and thickly corded with strong muscle. Rhidi and the other troopers were subjected to a number of exercises designed to make them solid racks of muscle, and Humans used only *loose* weights. There were no grav rooms, no torsion arrays…

… just bars, benches, and steel.

Drill Sergeants coached every trooper in the ways of strength, from elevated squatting to the humble arm curl, and the training would always happen three times per week. Rhidi had thought they were joking, but the next four days were further study in mastering the workout regime.

Rhidi had thought herself plenty strong after all the normal physical training in basic, but she quickly learned that she could, in fact, have muscles she had never known about get sore.

Then there was the weird issue with the food; Rhidi felt like she was getting way, *way* more meat and other proteins than normal.

The DFAC workers now kept an eye on her, even holding up lines to make sure they weighed her tray.

Rhidi had the same problem one day at breakfast, her tail fuzzing out in a fray as the very tall and *wide* Human called out to the line.

“Hold up there.” He said politely, holding up a massive hand as he took Rhidi’s tray. He looked over at her as he placed her tray onto a scale. “Good morning missus Rhidi! How is your fifth day of Black Phase?”

Rhidi yawned, her muscles screeching at her with every movement. “I thought we already learned how to work out, but it appears we have all been led to believe lies.”

“Ha!” He guffawed, placing various meats on her tray along with eggs and pancakes, all weighed by the gram for accuracy. “Well I’m sure you know, those big ole suits of armor can get quite heavy! Gotta make sure you poor little troopers can handle the weight in case something goes wrong.”

Rhidi sniffed, lightly wobbling back and forth with a deep desire to drink an entire gallon of orange juice.

With her heavy tray in straining hands, attached to tired muscles, Rhidi teetered herself over towards a table. She slowly started eating her massive tray of food as Alias dropped a glass of orange juice down for her. Shasta then set a small cup of hot, steaming coffee on her other side, then wiggled Rhidi’s ear.

Rhidi muttered a thanks through her mouthful of food, even though it sounded more like a lyrical groan.

“Poor little Rhidi, being forced to eat.” Shasta said in a sing-song voice, setting down to his own tray of food with a clink of his soda tab string. “Not that you have any issuesss putting all of that away.”

Rhidi sleepily slurped on her coffee, her eye twitching as the acrid, bitter fluid hit her tongue like hawthorn hitting the grill of a scout skimmer. Human coffee was a horrible, awful drink, but it had more stimulants in it than what were ever allowed in Kafya space. To Rhidi, she may have well licked a lump of charcoal and tried to drink a mouthful of battery acid.

She smacked her lips, pulling a pained face as the mouthy liquid grumbled its way into her system. “I’m always starving now. If my mother saw me eat like this, she would try to put me in a control jacket.” 

“Your body is just reacting to the sudden change in requirements.” Alias said matter of factly, happily cutting into his waffles. “Kafya eat gels and bars while staying lithe. The Humans are feeding you high nutrient food and making you lift heavy things, it’s gonna change some stuff in you.”

“Lilgara and Pwah are major meat eatersss.” Shasta said, his uniform jangling lightly as he reached over to grab a pepper shaker. “Meatsss, vegetables, bread, we share a very sssimilar diet to the Humansss, but their food isss just… different.”

Alias nodded, watching as Rhidi popped an entire fried egg into her mouth with worried eyebrows. “You guys have had an extremely controlled diet, so, who knows what’s going to happen. Earth produces nutrients in food like we’ve never seen before, so, I guess we’re all going to change a little.”

“Why are some of your ears different colors?” Rhidi asked plainly, groggily stabbing at another egg on her tray. “I’ve been too tired to really notice, but some of the Pwah’s ear tips are… yellow, or blue.”

Alias pointed to a nearby male with red ear tips. “They’re just a mod, adds a little flair. We can’t really remove them once they’re installed, but we agreed to keep them all off during basic training. Now that we’re in our job training, they were allowed to turn them back on.”

“Why don’t *you* have them?” Rhidi asked while leaning in close to Alias, then slipped the whole egg into her mouth to elicit a spine crawl from Alias.

Rhidi knew he hated how she ate eggs, and it was always fun to her.

Alias put a finger on her nose and pushed her away with a growl. “Because, *dear Kafya*, they can’t come *out*. And since they *can’t* come out, I don’t want them in *me*.”

Rhidi chewed open mouthed for a moment since Alias was looking at her, bursting the yolk messily. She then snortled in early morning glee when Alias erupted into disgusted noises. Shasta laughed as well, all while stealing one of Rhidi’s extra bacon slices.

We’ve lived together for almost a year and overall it’s been fine—different work schedules, different lifestyles, but nothing unmanageable. I work nights at a hospital, she does freelance design stuff from home.

The issue is... the kitchen. Specifically, this one drawer by the sink. At some point, Mel started keeping her hair stuff in there—brush, clips, dry shampoo, one of those wide paddle brushes that somehow always has a strand or two of hair stuck in it. It’s not gross gross, but it’s weird, right? A hairbrush next to the dish towels?

At first I ignored it. Like, whatever, maybe she just set it there temporarily. But it’s been months. I finally said something last week when I went to grab a bottle opener and pulled out a hair tie instead. I made a kind of dumb joke, like “Did your scalp move into the silverware drawer?” and she laughed. I followed up with a, “Hey, seriously though, could you keep that stuff in the bathroom?” and she didn’t really say anything back.

Next day—drawer’s still got the brush in it. I put it on the bathroom sink.

That night she texts me (I was at work):
Mel: “Please don’t move my things around. That drawer’s where I get ready in the morning bc the light’s better.”
Me: “I get that, but it’s still the kitchen. It kinda squicks me out when I’m eating toast next to hair product.”
Mel: “K.”

So yeah. Things have been... weird since. She still uses the drawer but moved the brush. Now it’s just like, hair ties and her little bag of bobby pins. And I know this is petty, but she also unplugged the coffee maker I always leave on (not sure if it’s connected but it feels connected).

I get that she’s used to her routine. I also get skeeved out seeing personal grooming stuff where food lives. But now I’m second guessing—like, did I make it a bigger deal than it was?

I got spontaneously pregnant in August 2024, with a MMC in October. My RE (and two others) kept insisting it was an egg quality issue, but I really pushed for them to test my husband. We are still waiting on DNA fragmentation results, but got the semen analysis:

Concentration 62 million 
Count 355 million

Morphology: 0% normal..
Head defects: 92% 
Tail defects: 85% 
Midpiece defects: 43% 
Cytoplasmic defects: 21%
Teratozoospermia index: 2.41 (meaning on average each sperm has 2.41 defects) 

So we called the RE since I'm about to have an IUI and his secretary said he's on vacation but she would ask if we should proceed. She called back and said he said it was ""nothing to worry about.""

How in the world can that be nothing to worry about?! Has anyone had success with these numbers? I wanted to move right to trying IVF again, but the RE convinced me to do IUI. 

My understanding is that sperm with head defects can't penetrate an egg. Sperm with tail defects probably won't make it to the egg anyway. And sperm with an average of 2.41 defects... we don't have a chance. 

Husband is 38, doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, has a coffee every day, is in good health and physically fit. Has extremely low testosterone, but RE doesn't want to treat it with clomid because his sperm concentration is adequate. ",1,1743032310.0,IVF,0,1.0,False

Our space is a mix of low cubicle dividers and a few private offices lining the perimeter. The break room—a cramped, hectic space nestled between HR and a set of tiny conference rooms—is where the drama unfolds. It’s equipped with two microwaves, a perpetually overstuffed fridge, and that sad, temperamental coffee machine we all pretend doesn’t exist.

For the past few months, I’ve had this coworker—let’s call him Jake—who has developed a disturbing habit. Every day, without fail, Jake somehow ends up “forgetting” to bring his lunch. At first, he’d politely ask for a bite of my chicken, rice, and roasted vegetables (my carefully prepped meal that I rely on not only for nutrition but also to keep my budget intact). I would laugh it off, thinking he was just having a bad day. But then it escalated.

Last Tuesday, I came back to the break room after a long meeting only to find my lunch completely missing. I asked around, and whispers soon confirmed that Jake had taken it. When I confronted him later, he shrugged it off, saying, “It’s just food, man.” That’s when it all started to build up—the disrespect wasn’t just about one missing meal; it was about the constant disregard for my effort and time. I’d been putting up with it for weeks, silently counting every stolen bite.

Determined not to let it slide any longer, that same day I returned to the break room with a fresh container of my meal. I caught sight of Jake eyeing it like a kid in a candy store. That was my breaking point.

I exploded. I shouted, “Jake, enough is enough! Every single day, you shamelessly take my food without even a thank-you or an apology! I work hard to prepare these meals to save money and eat healthily, and you’re treating it like a free-for-all buffet! Do you have any idea how disrespectful that is? It’s not just about the food—it’s about my time, my effort, and my dignity!”

The room fell silent. Some coworkers looked shocked, others nodded as if they’d been silently suffering the same fate. Jake’s face went beet red, and he mumbled a weak apology. I didn’t stop there. I continued, “If you can’t take responsibility for yourself, then stop acting like our lunches are a communal potluck. I’m not your personal food ATM, and I won’t let you take advantage of me any longer!”

Following my outburst, HR got involved. Jake was reprimanded and warned that any future incidents would have serious consequences. Now, a few coworkers are telling me I overreacted—that it was “just lunch.” But honestly? This wasn’t about a single meal; it was the culmination of months of feeling disrespected and taken for granted.

1jkq4mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stavanger/comments/1jkq4mf/best_restaurants_in_stavanger_norway/,"Best Restaurants in Stavanger, Norway","So I've lived in Stavanger for over two years now and I believe I've been to just about every restaurant that's peaked my interest in town. I figured I'd write a guild of the best spots for food in case anyone's interested. 

**Kafe Oransjeriet**: fantastic new place serving vegetarian food. It's primarily a morning / day spot since they close at 6 but you can get a really great glass of wine in the early evening if you're feeling it. 

**Gadja**: wow, it's really really good. Ethiopian food so you eat with your hands, there's something so incredibly human about using no utensils for dinner. 

**Restaurant SOL**: It's a fancy place, they do a preset menu with 8 courses. Nice for a special birthday but it's a one and done for me given the price point.

**Fisketorget**: of course. You need to make a reservation but it's not typically a big deal if you plan a week out. I usually go for the a la carte since I prefer just having a glass of red wine with a big bowl of their fish soup and sour dough bread / whipped butter. That's the reason to go right? 

**A. Idsoe**: really great steaks. We tend to order the cheapest filets and they're dang good. Don't miss the chimichurri! HOT TIP: you can book your table a bit early if you don't find one at the time that you want to come in. They hold the tables for 2.5 hours, meaning you can show up an hour late and still have an 1.5 to eat. Just make sure you call in to let them know you'll be late. 

**Molino**: best bakery in town without a doubt. They do sandwiches and coffee too, there is always people sitting and enjoying the sun on the weekends. 

**Kansui**: decent. It's kind of the only ramen place in town so there isn't much competition. The bummer is that it's a bit pricey for a bowl of noodles.

**Micro Kaffi**: awesome little coffee shop. They really care about their roasts and it's always nice to strike up a conversation with the baristas. I wish they did decaf or matcha. 

**Ouch Burger**: personally I like thinner, topping dominate burgers. It isn't everyone preference but if that's also your style, Ouch is the best. I also really really like their house French fry dip.

**Sirkus Renaa - Lagardsveien**: For sure the best Napoleon pizza in Stavanger. So Sirkus Renaa is a chain, they have two locations in the centrum but the Lagardsveien one in the hotel is hands down the best one. Frankly, I live in town and go out of my way to drive and get pizza from here instead.

**Pasha**: Turkish food, do I need to say anything more? It's darn good and it's the only place in town I can guarantee there will be people sitting there any night of the week. Portion size is generous, food is delicious, prices are right. 

**Norvina**: it's an asian grocery store but they have a little kiosk in the back corner that you can find a cheap lunch. That's a big deal since most of the places in town will hurt your pockets. 

**Thai Street Food**: There's a few Thai eateries but this one is the most cozy and authentic. Be careful with the spice level, they will actually make your meal spicy if you ask for it.

**Iddis Cafe (Canning Museum)**: This one's kind of cool because my local friends would never find it if I didn't invite them to it. To be fair, it's at a pretty small museum, good for tourist for an hour but not super interesting for someone who grew up here. But the patio area of Iddis is perfect, in direct sun and closed off so you don't feel the wind. They do some great open sandwiches, a must for a warm day. 

**Siddis**: Gelato! Made in house by a team of people who really care. Their chocolate ice cream is so good and the tindved (sea buckhorn) sorbet is a real delicacy. Love this place. 



  
Honorable mentions (aka places I haven't been yet but are on my radar): 

Taste of Poland: seems nice and fairly priced. 

K2: We've made a reservation and then canceled due to illness. A tiny bit frustrating that they won't tell you what's on their preset menu but it seems to be good? Very pricey. 

Gustav's Vinbar: looks great, we just haven't made it over there yet. 







Well, that's all I've got. Let me know if I missed one of your favorites, I could always use a new recommendation!

This isn’t financial advice. This is a **call to arms**. MOONIE isn’t here to hold your hand—it’s here to slap you awake. It’s for the ones who thrive on chaos, who laugh at “safe bets,” who know that in crypto, the crazier it is, the higher it flies. Fortune favors the bold, and MOONIE favors the borderline insane.

Hey y’all. I’m not publicly out to nearly anyone in my life so I have no one to turn to for advice or opinions. So here I am. If you’re not up for a novel, feel free to skip, I am long winded. 😅

I’m experiencing the most insane crush for one of the first times in my life and I’m in my mid 20s. But I cannot tell how she feels or if she likes me. I don’t even know if she’s queer. (Yes I know I could ask her straight out but I wanted to come here before ever going that route)

First off, she lives in Europe and I’m in the states.  I’ve known her for almost 3 years now- we meet in person about twice a year in Europe for work related events (we’re both writers/in film). She’s 29 and has never really dated. A lot of her friends are gay men and she’s very liberal and open minded. She has the biggest heart and will treat anyone like her best friend, so sometimes things are hard to read. We were all drunk once and she and our female friend started making out for fun, stumbling in the street. It was all in fun and she quickly grabbed my hand, laughing, and we all ran off like juveniles. 

We’ve always texted over the years on and off but this last summer I ran into her unexpectedly at a festival. Like literally ran into her. Although she was there staying with other friends we spent most all our free time together— picnics and lunch, clubbing, drinks, she bought us pastries for the beach and we swam and watched the sun rise after an all nighter on the town. (She later texted me saying she wish she would’ve taken pictures of me on the beach because it would’ve been “perfect with the light”) We sat on the asphalt cross legged like children and shared gelato. She called me in a panic one night asking if I had gotten home safe… our goodbye this last time was different (to me at least) - she loves hugs, as do I, so we hugged a lot. I saw her off on a bus and we waved until we couldn’t see each other. Then texted immediately. (Though she’s fluent, English isn’t her first language- she speaks about 6- so she says things in such an adorable way to me sometimes.) she said she missed me a lot already and would “even miss me when her brain rewired” - we were running on no sleep for a week. 

After that she would send hearts out of the blue, we would share music, send voice messages where she’d giggle and say she’s sending me kisses (oh, my heart) and send voices updating each other on day to day life. Then after a few months, radio silence. It lasted through the holidays and I decided not to push it- I had sent the last message and the last thing I want to do is annoy her. (If they wanted to, they would, right?) 

Then one January day I receive two videos, about 5 minutes total. In them, she apologizes and talks about how she’s known for being bad at responding to texts, but never this bad. She had some personal things going on, a very sick family member she had to take care of, loss of a secure job and whatnot. She said it’s been bothering her we haven’t talked but she didn’t know how to approach me so she just pressed record and started talking. She babbles for awhile sheepishly and ends the first video. The second starts with her taking a deep breath and saying what she was trying to say is that she misses me. Genuinely. And laughed at herself for rambling on for minutes just to tell me she missed me. She goes on to say she thinks I’m an amazing person and she’s “so so so” happy we reconnected this past summer and is sending me love. 

Well. I replied with a video of my own, and my pet was in it. She replied saying we “are both precious.” We texted more consistently, and began video calls every other week or so. We have to work around time zones, but make it work. She’s always the one to initiate the calls. They are always 1-2 hours long, or more. We have such good conversations outside of updating each other, but about goals and creative work, travel, religion, politics… it flows so lovely and we only focus on each other for those hours. It’s my absolute favorite. 

She always likes or comments my stories on social media. Recently she’s made comments during our calls here and there like that my eyes looked pretty, my outfit looked nice, that I can come stay with her whenever and she’d love to cook for me. I’ve been burnt out lately and expressed this, she said she’d “wrap me in a blanket, make me a tea and massage my hands until I slept” … I said I’d cry if anyone ever treated me like that. She just smiled. 

Now this all sounds great, going good for me and all, except she really is an awful texter. It’s at least a day in between responses, sometimes close to a week. Then she’ll be good for awhile, and back to poor again. She’s stated she’s bad at texting before, but I just have such a hard time believing she would like me if she takes so long to respond. She texts me and my heart leaps at the notification and I just want to stop what I’m doing and reply. I do think there’s a lot of truth to the “if they wanted to they would” idea, but the signals I’m getting are such polar opposites sometimes I am just so confused.

Is she just a flirty European? I will say I haven’t reciprocated much flirting (if that’s what it is) because I’m unsure, I freeze up and get very shy. But I blush and I believe she can tell over video. But I can’t imagine her having feelings, and then seeing my text for 5 days and just not taking a bit of time to respond. But maybe she wants to give a proper response- I can be bad at replying to friends and family. But a crush is … different. 

I can’t believe how enamored with her I am. She’s so intelligent and kind and soft and stunning. She is so funny and isn’t afraid to be dorky or silly in front of others— she’s unapologetically herself. I have a hard time even believing she would find an interest in me friend-wise let alone romantically. She is perfect to me. I want to cook with her and cuddle on the couch after our shifts. I want to wake up alongside her and make her coffee in the mornings the way she likes it and travel with her, teach her how to drive my car. Have someone to finally watch sunsets with…

I’m the first to be an advocate for finding yourself and learning how to be independent while single, etc etc. But I’ve backpacked over 50 countries, stayed in hostels, slept on floors, worked in dozens of countries and met and befriended people from all walks of life. And out of all the souls I’ve met on my adventures, hers is the most radiant to me. I also think I’d finally like to know what sharing is like. 

I want to tell her, I want to be honest and open but I’m so afraid of ruining the friendship we have. I don’t want things to be awkward or the air to shift. I’m so afraid of ruining this, because even if it stays friendship, I would cherish it forever. But I will tell her eventually. I see her in a few months as we’re sharing a hotel for work. I’ll say something, I just wanted feedback from an outside source before I go about this… 

Anyways. If you made it this far I commend you, thank you. I’ll take any opinions, advice, critiques, whatnot and otherwise. I’m sure there’s things I’ve missed but I just needed to get this out of my system, so even if I’m talking to the void, I’m still grateful.

If you received a cold email from me, I’m sorry to break the news.

It wasn’t actually from me.

It was from an AI clone that captures my voice and writing style. This digital version crafts personalized emails that sound like they came from an old college roommate, but without any of my human anxiety or hesitation.

Here’s how I created a free, open-source fully automated system that researches influencers, understands their content, and generates hyper-personalized emails.

# Why I created LeadGenGPT, an open-source Lead Generation System

I created this system out of a desperate need. I had to find people that wanted to partner with me for my content.

I first did the traditional approach. I had an Excel Spreadsheet, went to YouTube, and found influencers within my niche.

I then watched their content, trying to figure out if I liked them or not, and hoped to remember key facts about the influencers so I could demonstrate that I was paying attention to them.

I wasn’t.

Finally, I searched for their email. If I found, I typed out an email combining everything I knew and hoped for a response.

All-in-all, the process took me around 5 to 15 minutes per person. It was also anxiety-inducing and demoralizing – I wasn’t getting a bunch of traction despite understanding the potential of doing the outreach. I thought about hiring some from the Philippines to do the work for me.

But then I started deploying AI. And now, you can too faster than it takes to send one personalized email manually. Let me show you how.

# How to set up and deploy the hyperpersonalized email system?

Using the lead generation system is actually quite simple. Here is a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1)** Downloading the source code from GitHub

**Step 2)** Installing the dependencies with

    npm install

**Step 3)** Creating an account on Requesty and SendGrid and generating API keys for each

**Step 4)** Create a file called .env and inputting the following environment variables

    SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
    CLOUD_DB=mongodb://your_cloud_db_connection_string
    LOCAL_DB=mongodb://localhost:27017/leadgen_db
    REQUESTY_API_KEY=your_requesty_api_key
    TEST_EMAIL=your_test_email@example.com
    SENDGRID_EMAIL=your_sendgrid_email@example.com
    FROM_NAME=""Your Name""
    FROM_FIRST_NAME=FirstName

You should replace all of the values with the actual values you’ll use. Note: for my personal use-cases, I automatically send emails connected locally to my email for testing. If this is undesirable for you, you may want to update the code.

**Step 5)** Update *src/sendEmail.ts* to populate the file with a list of emails that you will send.

    const PEOPLE: { email: string; name: string }[] = [
    // Add emails here
    ]

To figure out *how* to acquire this list, you’ll need to use OpenAI’s Deep Research. I wrote an article about it here and created a video demonstration.

**Step 7)** Update the system prompt in *src/prompts/coldOutreach.ts*! This step allows you to personalize your email by adding information about what you’re working on, facts about you, and how you want the email to sound.

For example, in the repo now, you’ll see the following for *src/prompts/coldOutreach.ts.*

    const COLD_OUTREACH_PROMPT = `Today is ${moment()
      .tz(""America/New_York"")
      .format(""MMMM D, YYYY"")} (EST)

    #Description
    You will generate a very short, concise email for outreach
    
    #Instructions
    Your objective is to generate a short, personable email to the user. 
    
    Facts about you:
    * [List your key personal facts, achievements, and background]
    * [Include relevant education, work experience, and notable projects]
    * [Add any unique selling points or differentiators]
    
    Your company/product:
    * [Describe your main product/service]
    * [List key features and benefits]
    * [Include any unique value propositions]
    
    Your partnership/invitation:
    * [Explain what kind of partnership or collaboration you're seeking]
    * [List specific incentives or benefits for the recipient]
    * [Include any special offers or early-bird advantages]
    
    GUIDELINES:
    * Only mention facts about yourself if they create relevant connections
    * The email should be 8 sentences long MAX
    * ONLY include sources (like [1] in the comments, not the main content 
    * Do NOT use language about specific strategies or offerings unless verified
    * If you don't know their name, say ""Hey there"" or ""Hi"". Do NOT leave the template variable in.
    
    RESPONSE FORMATTING:
    You will generate an answer using valid HTML. You will NOT use bold or italics. It will just be text. You will start with the body tags, and have the ""container"" class for a div around it, and the ""signature"" class for the signature.
    
    The call to action should be normal and personable, such as ""Can we schedule 15 minutes to chat?"" or ""coffee on me"" or something normal.
    
    For Example:
    
    <body>
        <div class=""container"">
            <p>Hey {user.firstName},</p>
            
            <p>[Personal fact or generic line about their content]. My name is [Your Name] and [a line about your company/product].</p>
            
            <p>[Call to action]</p>
            <p>[Ask a time to schedule or something ""let me know what you think; let me know your thoughts""
            <div class=""signature"">
                <p>Best,<br>
                ${process.env.FROM_FIRST_NAME || process.env.FROM_NAME}</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
    
    <!-- 
    - This email [why this email is good][source index]
    - [other things about this email]
    - [as many sources as needed]
    -->
    
    #SUCCESS
    This is a successful email. This helps the model understand the emails 
    that does well. 
    
    [Example of a successful email that follows your guidelines and tone]`;
    
    const COLD_OUTREACH_PROMPT_PRE_MESSAGE = `Make sure the final response is 
    in this format
    
    <body>
        <div class=""container"">
            <p>Hey {user.firstName},</p>
            
            <p>[Personal fact or generic line about their content]. My name 
    is <a href=""[Your LinkedIn URL]"">[Your Name]</a> and [a line about your
     company/product].</p>
            
            <p>[Call to action]</p>
            <p>[Ask a time to schedule or something ""let me know what you think; let me know your thoughts""
            <div class=""signature"">
                <p>Best,<br>
                ${process.env.FROM_FIRST_NAME || process.env.FROM_NAME}</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>`;

Here is where you’ll want to update:

* The instructions section
* The facts about you
* Your company and product
* Guidelines and constraints
* Response formatting

Finally, after setting up the system, you can proceed with the most important step!

**Step 8)** Send your first hyperpersonalized email! Run *src/sendEmail.ts* and the terminal will ask you questions such as if you want to run it one at a time (interactive mode) or if you want to send them all autonomously (automatic mode).

If you choose interactive mode, it will ask for your confirmation every time it sends an email. I recommend this when you first start using the application.

    Generating email for User A...
    Subject: Opportunity to Collaborate
    [Email content displayed]
    Send this email? (y/yes, n/no, t/test, , s/skip, cs/change subject): y
    Email sent to user-a@example.com

In automatic mode, the emails will send constantly with a 10 second delay per email. Do this when you’re 100% confident in your prompt to send hyperpersonalized emails without ANY manual human intervention.

This system works by using Perplexity, which is capable of searching the web for details about the user. Using those results, it constructs a hyperpersonalized email that you can send to them via SendGrid.

But sending hyperpersonalized emails isn’t the only thing the platform can do. It can also follow-up.

# Other features of LeadGenGPT for cold outreach

In addition to sending the initial email, the tool has functionality for:

* Email validation
* Preventing multiple initial emails being sent to the same person
* Updating the email status
* Sending follow-ups after the pre-defined period of time

By automating both initial outreach and follow-up sequences, LeadGenGPT handles the entire email workflow while maintaining personalization. It’s literally an all-in-one solution for small businesses to expand their sales outreach. All for free.

How cool is that?

# Turning Over to the Dark Side

However, I recognize this technology has significant ethical implications. By creating and open-sourcing this tool, I’ve potentially contributed to the AI spam problem already plaguing platforms like Reddit and TikTok, which could soon overwhelm our inboxes.

I previously wrote:

>“Call me old-fashion, but even though I LOVE using AI to help me build software and even create marketing emails for my app, using AI to generate hyper-personalized sales email feels… wrong.” — me

This responsibility extends beyond me alone. The technology ecosystem — from Perplexity’s search capabilities to OpenAI’s language models — has made these systems possible. The ethical question becomes whether the productivity benefits for small businesses outweigh the potential downsides.

For my business, the impact has been transformative. With the manual approach, I sent just 14 messages over a month before giving up.

[Pic: My color-coded spreadsheet for sending emails](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*eGgrVWc9U14HIUk4o8LsBw.png)

With this tool, I was literally able to send the same amount of emails… in about 3 minutes.

[Pic: A screenshot showing how many more AI-Generated emails I sent in a day](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*lxOJrocRBYkFFZ2jddqZjA.png)

Since then, I’ve sent over 130 more. That number will continue to increase, as I spend more time and energy selling my platform and less time building it. As a direct result, I went from literally 0 responses to over half a dozen.

I couldn’t have done this without AI.

This is what most people, even most of Wall Street, doesn’t understand about AI.

It’s not about making big tech companies even richer. It’s about making small business owners more successful. With this lead generation system, I’ve received magnitudes more interest for my trading platform [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/) that I could’ve never done without it. I can send the emails to people that I know are interested in it, and can dedicate more of my energy into developing a platform that people want to use.

So while I understand the potential of this to be problematic, I can’t ignore the insane impact. To those who decide to use this tool, I urge you to do so responsibly. Comply with local laws such as CAN-SPAM, don’t keep emailing people who have asked you to stop, and always focus on delivering genuine value rather than maximizing volume. The goal should be building authentic connections, not flooding inboxes.

# Concluding Thoughts

This prototype is just the beginning. While the tool has comprehensive features for sending emails, creating follow-ups, and updating the status, imagine a fully autonomous lead generation system that understands the best time to send the emails and the best subjects to hook the recipient.

Such a future is not far away.

As AI tools become more sophisticated, the line between human and machine communication continues to blur. While some might see this as concerning, I view it as liberating — freeing up valuable time from manual research and outreach so we can focus on building meaningful relationships once connections are established.

    RESPONSE FORMATTING:
    You will generate an answer using valid HTML. You will NOT use bold or italics. It will just be text. You will start with the body tags, and have the ""container"" class for a div around it, and the ""signature"" class for the signature.
    
    The call to action should be normal and personable, such as ""Can we schedule 15 minutes to chat?"" or ""coffee on me"" or something normal.

Finally, after setting up the system, you can proceed with the most important step!

**Step 8)** Send your first hyperpersonalized email! Run *src/sendEmail.ts* and the terminal will ask you questions such as if you want to run it one at a time (interactive mode) or if you want to send them all autonomously (automatic mode).

If you choose interactive mode, it will ask for your confirmation every time it sends an email. I recommend this when you first start using the application.

In automatic mode, the emails will send constantly with a 10 second delay per email. Do this when you’re 100% confident in your prompt to send hyperpersonalized emails without ANY manual human intervention.

This system works by using Perplexity, which is capable of searching the web for details about the user. Using those results, it constructs a hyperpersonalized email that you can send to them via SendGrid.

But sending hyperpersonalized emails isn’t the only thing the platform can do. It can also follow-up.

# Other features of LeadGenGPT for cold outreach

In addition to sending the initial email, the tool has functionality for:

* Email validation
* Preventing multiple initial emails being sent to the same person
* Updating the email status
* Sending follow-ups after the pre-defined period of time

By automating both initial outreach and follow-up sequences, LeadGenGPT handles the entire email workflow while maintaining personalization. It’s literally an all-in-one solution for small businesses to expand their sales outreach. All for free.

How cool is that?

# Turning Over to the Dark Side

However, I recognize this technology has significant ethical implications. By creating and open-sourcing this tool, I’ve potentially contributed to the AI spam problem already plaguing platforms like Reddit and TikTok, which could soon overwhelm our inboxes.

I previously wrote:

>“Call me old-fashion, but even though I LOVE using AI to help me build software and even create marketing emails for my app, using AI to generate hyper-personalized sales email feels… wrong.” — me

This responsibility extends beyond me alone. The technology ecosystem — from Perplexity’s search capabilities to OpenAI’s language models — has made these systems possible. The ethical question becomes whether the productivity benefits for small businesses outweigh the potential downsides.

For my business, the impact has been transformative. With the manual approach, I sent just 14 messages over a month before giving up.

[Pic: My color-coded spreadsheet for sending emails](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*eGgrVWc9U14HIUk4o8LsBw.png)

With this tool, I was literally able to send the same amount of emails… in about 3 minutes.

[Pic: A screenshot showing how many more AI-Generated emails I sent in a day](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*lxOJrocRBYkFFZ2jddqZjA.png)

Since then, I’ve sent over 130 more. That number will continue to increase, as I spend more time and energy selling my platform and less time building it. As a direct result, I went from literally 0 responses to over half a dozen.

I couldn’t have done this without AI.

This is what most people, even most of Wall Street, doesn’t understand about AI.

It’s not about making big tech companies even richer. It’s about making small business owners more successful. With this lead generation system, I’ve received magnitudes more interest for my trading platform [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/) that I could’ve never done without it. I can send the emails to people that I know are interested in it, and can dedicate more of my energy into developing a platform that people want to use.

So while I understand the potential of this to be problematic, I can’t ignore the insane impact. To those who decide to use this tool, I urge you to do so responsibly. Comply with local laws such as CAN-SPAM, don’t keep emailing people who have asked you to stop, and always focus on delivering genuine value rather than maximizing volume. The goal should be building authentic connections, not flooding inboxes.

# Concluding Thoughts

This prototype is just the beginning. While the tool has comprehensive features for sending emails, creating follow-ups, and updating the status, imagine a fully autonomous lead generation system that understands the best time to send the emails and the best subjects to hook the recipient.

Such a future is not far away.

As AI tools become more sophisticated, the line between human and machine communication continues to blur. While some might see this as concerning, I view it as liberating — freeing up valuable time from manual research and outreach so we can focus on building meaningful relationships once connections are established.

If you received a cold email from me, I’m sorry to break the news.

It wasn’t actually from me.

It was from an AI clone that captures my voice and writing style. This digital version crafts personalized emails that sound like they came from an old college roommate, but without any of my human anxiety or hesitation.

Here’s how I created a free, open-source fully automated system that researches influencers, understands their content, and generates hyper-personalized emails.

# Why I created LeadGenGPT, an open-source Lead Generation System

I created this system out of a desperate need. I had to find people that wanted to partner with me for my content.

I first did the traditional approach. I had an Excel Spreadsheet, went to YouTube, and found influencers within my niche.

I then watched their content, trying to figure out if I liked them or not, and hoped to remember key facts about the influencers so I could demonstrate that I was paying attention to them.

I wasn’t.

Finally, I searched for their email. If I found, I typed out an email combining everything I knew and hoped for a response.

All-in-all, the process took me around 5 to 15 minutes per person. It was also anxiety-inducing and demoralizing – I wasn’t getting a bunch of traction despite understanding the potential of doing the outreach. I thought about hiring some from the Philippines to do the work for me.

But then I started deploying AI. And now, you can too faster than it takes to send one personalized email manually. Let me show you how.

# How to set up and deploy the hyperpersonalized email system?

Using the lead generation system is actually quite simple. Here is a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1)** Downloading the source code from GitHub

**Step 2)** Installing the dependencies with

    npm install

**Step 3)** Creating an account on Requesty and SendGrid and generating API keys for each

**Step 4)** Create a file called .env and inputting the following environment variables

    SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
    CLOUD_DB=mongodb://your_cloud_db_connection_string
    LOCAL_DB=mongodb://localhost:27017/leadgen_db
    REQUESTY_API_KEY=your_requesty_api_key
    TEST_EMAIL=your_test_email@example.com
    SENDGRID_EMAIL=your_sendgrid_email@example.com
    FROM_NAME=""Your Name""
    FROM_FIRST_NAME=FirstName

You should replace all of the values with the actual values you’ll use. Note: for my personal use-cases, I automatically send emails connected locally to my email for testing. If this is undesirable for you, you may want to update the code.

**Step 5)** Update *src/sendEmail.ts* to populate the file with a list of emails that you will send.

    const PEOPLE: { email: string; name: string }[] = [
    // Add emails here
    ]

To figure out *how* to acquire this list, you’ll need to use OpenAI’s Deep Research. I wrote an article about it here and created a video demonstration.

**Step 7)** Update the system prompt in *src/prompts/coldOutreach.ts*! This step allows you to personalize your email by adding information about what you’re working on, facts about you, and how you want the email to sound.

For example, in the repo now, you’ll see the following for *src/prompts/coldOutreach.ts.*

    const COLD_OUTREACH_PROMPT = `Today is ${moment()
      .tz(""America/New_York"")
      .format(""MMMM D, YYYY"")} (EST)

I've been using Oral-B's mouthwash and it completely wrecked my teeth. Initially saw some good results, but after I stopped using it, my teeth started getting these awful stains. Coffee and tea are now sticking to my teeth like crazy, and they feel weirdly sticky all the time. Was this supposed to happen? Has anyone else experienced this? The product didn't mention anything about increased staining as a ""side effect"" after stopping use. One of my students asked me if I don't brush my teeth .

I’ll give some details about myself so that you can compare your results to my own, and maybe some of the more experienced guys on the sub can give me some pointers.

I’m Caucasian, a little below average height, and have pretty bad eyesight. I got out of the military 5 months ago and am working a min. wage. food service job. I’m 25.

Before my current streak, I had difficulty looking people in the ye, my voice was unstable, and I lacked the motivation to do anything but what was necessary.

Alright, on to benefits:

-the most notable is the lack of debilitating anxiety when talking to others, especially those who I perceive as doing better than myself.

-I’ve found d the motivation to get back in the gym

-for those who care, women seem to be more receptive to me than they were previously

-I’ve gotten back into reading

-I’ve been playing some guitar

-I don’t get caught up in negative thinking nearly as much, and can usually shake myself out of it

I haven’t experienced anything too surreal, except a phrase I keep hearing repeated to me in seeming unrelated situations:

“Iron Sharpens Iron”

Now I’ll admit, I’m on the nicotine patch right now, I drink one cup of coffee a day, and I sometimes binge drink, so this may not be a clean streak. I also had one wet dream about a week ago. But so far the most noticeable benefit has been increased confidence.

Any tips to maximize benefits would be helpful. Thank you guys.

Part 3 :  
The morning air is thick with warmth, carrying the scent of damp earth and sulphur. The steam rising from the ground makes everything feel heavier, like the town itself is breathing. I rub the sleep from my eyes, trying to shake the lingering unease from the night before. The sound of breathing—was it the wind? A dream? I’m not sure anymore.

Koro is already up when I step into the kitchen. He sits at the small wooden table, staring out the window with a cup of tea cradled in his weathered hands. His fingers are wrapped too tightly around the cup, his knuckles slightly pale.

""Morning,"" I say, grabbing a cup for myself.

He hums in response but doesn’t look away from the window. I follow his gaze—just steam drifting lazily through the trees, the same as always.

Something is off with him. I can feel it.

""You sleep okay?"" I ask, sipping my tea.

He takes a long time to answer. ""Dreams can be tricky things, girl. Best not to dwell on them.""

I frown. ""I never said I had a dream.""

Koro doesn’t reply. His grip tightens just slightly on his cup, and he takes another sip of tea, his eyes still fixed on the mist.

I need to get out of the house. The weight of last night’s unease still clings to me, and Koro isn’t helping. So, I walk.

Golden Springs looks even smaller than I remember. Most of the town has been reclaimed by nature—grass pushing through cracks in the pavement, trees growing too close to the road. A few houses have lights on, but most sit empty, paint peeling, curtains drawn tight.

It isn’t a ghost town. Not yet.

But it feels close.

I stop outside a small café—the only place still open. The bell above the door jingles as I step inside. The scent of coffee and baked goods mixes with the damp, musty smell of old wood.

Behind the counter stands a familiar face. Han. We used to go to school together. He’s taller, leaner, but his face still holds traces of the boy I once knew.

His eyes widen slightly when he sees me. ""Evelynn?""

I offer a small smile. ""Hey, Han. Long time.""

He wipes his hands on a cloth, glancing toward the back of the café as if making sure no one else is listening. ""Didn’t think you’d ever come back.""

""Just visiting Koro,"" I say, stepping up to the counter. ""How’s the town been?""

Han exhales through his nose, shaking his head. ""Same as always. Just... quieter.""

I grab a coffee and a small pastry, paying quickly, but as he hands me my change, I feel it again.

That **prickle**.

Like someone is watching.

I turn slightly, scanning the empty café. Nothing seems out of place, but the feeling doesn’t fade.

Han must notice my unease because he hesitates before speaking again. ""Marama... she used to feel like that too.""

I tense. ""Marama? Your sister?""

He nods, voice lower now. ""She had nightmares. Said someone was following her. She was convinced of it. And then..."" He glances toward the fogged-up windows. ""She disappeared.""

A cold weight settles in my stomach. ""What do you mean, disappeared?""

He hesitates, then sighs. ""Just... be careful, Evelynn. People talk about the estate taking folks, but there’s no proof. Just whispers.""

The estate. That damn estate. I wondered if they had expanded more. Driving to Golden Springs, I had noticed massive gates with symbols on them. Strange—so strange.

I swallow, gripping my coffee a little tighter. ""Thanks for the warning.""

I turn and leave, stepping back into the humid air. The steam curls through the streets, moving unnaturally, shifting around the buildings like it’s alive.

That’s when I see him.

A figure dressed in grey, standing about a hundred meters away.

Motionless. Watching.

I freeze, my grip tightening around the coffee cup. My breath comes slow and shallow. The figure doesn’t move. I take a step back. Then another.

He follows.

I turn and walk faster. My pulse pounds in my ears. I glance over my shoulder—he’s still there, keeping his distance but never stopping.

By the time I reach Koro’s house, I’m almost running.

I bolt the door behind me, heart hammering. Peering through the curtain, I scan the empty road outside.

No one.

I let out a shaky breath before grabbing a bag and shoving a few essentials inside.

Checking in on Koro, I force my voice to sound steady. ""I’m going for a hikoi. I’ll be back later.""

Koro doesn’t look up from his tea. Just gives a small nod, as if he already knew I’d be going.

As if he expected it.

I hesitate for a second longer, then turn and step back out into the mist.

I follow the stream, its surface shifting with the heat rising from the ground. The further I walk, the denser the mist becomes, curling around my ankles like grasping fingers. My feet crunch against damp earth and scattered stones as I trace the water’s edge, searching for… what? Clues? A sign? Anything to explain the growing unease pressing against my ribs.

The world feels smaller here, swallowed by the fog, sound muffled beneath the steady gurgle of flowing water. That’s why I don’t notice right away.

The fence.

Tall. Rusted. The iron bars stretch high above my head, vanishing into the mist. Symbols, unfamiliar yet unsettling, have been carved into the metal, some newer, others so worn they bleed into the rust. My pulse quickens. Without realizing it, I’ve wandered onto the estate’s grounds.

A shiver crawls up my spine. The air here feels different, heavier, thick with something I can’t name. I turn, ready to retrace my steps—but then I hear it.

A low whisper.

Not words. Not quite.

The wind? The trees shifting in the breeze?

Or something else?

I step back, heart hammering, but the whisper comes again—closer this time.

Then the figures step into view.

They stand just beyond the fence, their clothes pristine, their eyes glazed over with a white, unnatural sheen.

Marama is among them.

My breath hitches. She looks straight through me, unblinking. And she isn’t alone.

The mist twists around them, thick and cloying, sticking to my skin like damp fingers. The air is wrong—too still, too hot. The figures beyond the fence stand motionless, yet their presence presses against me like a weight on my chest.

Marama’s lips part first. A slow, deliberate movement, like a puppet on invisible strings. The others follow, their mouths opening in eerie unison.

And then—the whispering.

It crawls into my ears, slithers beneath my skin. Not words. Not voices. Something deeper, older, twisting and coiling in a way that makes my bones feel hollow.

My breath hitches as a shape shifts in the mist, something bigger, watching from behind them.

And then they step forward.

I don’t think—I can’t think. I run.

The mist blurs around me, my heartbeat a frantic drum. Behind me, the whispers rise, twisting through the air like fingers reaching for me.

I don’t dare look back. I can feel them closing in.

And I know, without turning—

They are right behind me.

I ran.  
I didn’t think—I couldn’t think.  
My body moved on instinct, feet pounding against the dirt, breath coming in ragged, desperate gasps.  
The air felt thick, wrong, like it was pushing against me, trying to slow me down.

But I didn’t stop.  
I burst through the trees, past the broken fences and overgrown paths, my legs screaming, my lungs burning. Koro’s house—there.  
Just beyond the next rise.  
I didn’t care if I was loud, if I looked insane—I needed to be inside.  
Now.  
I reached the door and slammed into it, nearly fumbling the handle in my desperation.  
My fingers trembled as I twisted it, throwing my weight forward.  
The door flew open, and I stumbled inside, nearly collapsing.  
With shaking hands, I turned and shoved it shut behind me, twisting the lock with a sharp, metallic click. Silence.

Only the sound of my breathing—ragged, uneven, animalistic.  
I pressed my forehead against the wood, squeezing my eyes shut.  
The cold from outside still clung to my skin, but inside—it was warm.  
Safe.  
No whispers.  
No figures with empty eyes.  
No towering shape bleeding from the mist.  
Just home.  
My knees buckled.  
I turned, moving on autopilot, my limbs sluggish, my body heavy with exhaustion and fear.  
I made it to my room before my brain even caught up, before the reality of what had just happened could sink its claws into me.  
The bed.  
I lunged for it, yanking the covers over me like a child.  
My heart thundered so hard I could feel it in my throat.  
I squeezed my eyes shut.  
If I don’t look, it can’t get me.  
If I don’t look, it’s not real.  
The blankets were warm, cocooning me, shielding me from the world.  
I was safe. I was safe. Right? …Right?  
reaching for my laptop I thought that writing would be the best way to unfold it all and look at it.   
Was I being delusional, was this my mental health playing a trick on me?   
Or is this really happening.   
It was terrifying. I never had experiance anything like it guys.

Starting in early February, I started focusing more on my diet, however I haven't seen any weight loss, so I wanted to ask for some critique of my diet, and any improvements to be made. I wouldn't consider myself extremely active, I do an intense upper/lower body routine every other day (Usually \~30 mins drop and standard sets), a mile-long bike low intensity bike ride, as well as gardening, if that counts as an exercise of sorts?

I am not the one shopping for groceries a majority of the time, as my parents' schedules are very tight, and I am usually at school when they like to go shopping. However, they are supportive of my weight loss goals, just as long as its relatively affordable.

I'll give a rundown of what I eat on an average day here along with reasoning and such. (Most seasoning/flavoring with 0 Cals will not be included)

**Breakfast:** \~350 cals, 37g carbs, 4g fat, \~13g protein

2/3 cup of nonfat, plain Greek yogurt  
\~1/2 teaspoon of artifical sweetener (Varies, usually stevia or sweet and low)  
1/8 cup of Granola  
Handful of blueberries/strawberries  
Coffee creamer

I think Greek yogurt is a solid choice for my mornings. Its quick, easy to make, and satisfies my morning sweet tooth. Ideally, I would use protein granola, as well as sub out any coffee creamer, but they don't carry protein granola at my local store, and I hate black coffee.

  
**Lunch:** 275 cals, 18g carbs, 10g fat, 40g protein

2 scoops/45g Naked whey protein powder  
1 cup Unsweetened soymilk  
1/4 cup lowfat cottage cheese  
\~teaspoon of artifical sweetener (Varies)

A quick protein shake is usually great for my lunch (I think). I only get about 20 mins for lunch at school, and I need to talk with teachers, leaving me with about 5-10 minutes to eat depending on the line at the microwave. Because of that, I just bring a protein shake so I can stay relatively full until dinner, while still hitting protein goals. I hate the taste of normal protein powder, so I use unsweetened ones so I can add my own sweetener. I use soymilk because it's about the same protein as regular milk, but without as much sugar. I add cottage cheese because it makes the shake creamier, while still adding protein.  


**Dinner:** Varies

I don't make my dinner a majority of the time, and when I do, it's my parents who choose what we're making. Luckily, a majority of these meals are healthy, and I've managed to convince them to eat less fried dinners for my weight loss. However, they do still tend to be a little carb heavy with noodles and such. On average, my dinner comes out to around 500-600 cals. 

**Snacks:** 

Ok now here is where I could improve. A lot of time when I'm in the kitchen helping clean/wash dishes, I become tempted to indulge in a dessert off some kind. When I've eaten a heavy or fried meal, I tend to skip it, but on an average day, I have dessert.

Ice cream is my go-to here. I eat a ""light"" version of it coming out to around 150 cals. 

I also have a late-night fruit every day in order to subdue my sweet tooth. I usually stick with a pear or apple.

Occasionally, I do eat extra during school if there is someone selling snacks or something, but I stay aware of my limits.



With all of this, I average about 1600-1800 cals a day. I am aware that I eat more carbs, but that shouldn't completely negate the effects of a caloric deficit, right?

I could get rid of my dessert every afternoon, but it would be a hard choice to make, and I feel like it will make my diet less sustainable?

I do have a cheat meal every week, tending to be about 500 cals more than my average meal. Does that play a factor?

I don't consider myself extremely informed on diet, and I'm just confused here. You can ask me for anything else, any advice is appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read all of this!

Now, I have to stop taking Levothyroxine for a week before my PCP refers me to Endocronology? WTH?","I have 5 diagnoses that covid gave me, including Hashimoto's and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). My MCAS is managed by Hydroxyzine and Fluticasone. I take Omeprazole for Gerd (it's a PPI that also acts as a mast cell stabilizer). I'm one of the unfortunate people who can't tolerate the medications and/or fillers in OTC H1 and H2 antihistamines/histamine blockers. 

When I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's in August 2024, my TSH was 11.9. I took Levothyroxine 50mcg for two months. It seemed to improve some symptoms. But, it caused itchy, watery, and goopy eyes. And my muscle aches and pains plus crippling fatigue didn't improve. I discussed these symptoms with my doctor. 

I asked him to switch me to brand name Synthroid 50mcg four months ago. I thought everything was going great. No more severe muscle aches and cramps. No more severe fatigue. Except now I get flushing/hot flashes, I'm itchy, and my eyes are worse than ever: dry, crusty, and itchy. I have interstitial cystitis that rarely flares up. I thought I had a UTI or a yeast infection for 3 months. Constant burning. Constant urinating. I had to pee every hour, sometimes, multiple times an hour. No UTI. No yeast infection. 

I asked my doctor to switch me back to Levothyroxine because I can't tolerate these symptoms. My TSH was 3.0, recently. I asked him to increase my dose from 50mcg to 75mcg due to my symptoms. Now, I've been taking Levothyroxine 75mcg for three weeks. The muscle aches and cramps are excruciating. The fatigue is completely debilitating. I now have gastrointestinal problems that I didn't have before. I have to take Hydroxyzine up to 3xs a daily. And take Fluticasone multiple times a day. My eye problems are gone, though. (Before you ask, I couldn't ask for Tirosint before because I have a cheap ass HMO that we pay an abhorrent amount of money for in monthly health insurance premiums).

I just talked to my doctor and explained all my symptoms. I told him I need to be switched to Tirosint.

>Tirosint and Tirosint-SOL are thyroid hormone replacement medications, designed for hypothyroid patients with sensitivities or absorption challenges. Tirosint is a liquid gel capsule, while Tirosint-SOL is a liquid solution, both free of allergens like gluten, lactose, and dyes.

I told him it's my MCAS. Or I'm having allergic reactions. He said, ""We don't do that."" As in, he doesn't prescribe Tirosint. He also said, ""I doubt it's the medications. I haven't had anyone other than you who's had these reactions."" 

Excuse me?!.......WTF?!

I continue to tell him my symptoms in detail. Coughing that can last up to 20 minutes. Feeling like I can't breathe. I ask for Singular (Montelukast) and an asthma inhaler (Albuterol) to use for acute attacks. BTW, I don't have asthma. He prescribed both. He said he'll put in a referral to Endocronology and get back to me.

He calls me 20 minutes later. The Endocronologist told him to tell me to stop taking Levothyroxine for a week. If I stop having the symptoms, then they'll know I'm allergic to the fillers. I have to wait to take Singular until after this little experiment is conducted. After the week is up, I message my doctor, and he'll contact endocronology. And then, hopefully, I'll get my Tirosint. 

I'm sorry for my rant, but why the heck is this such a pain in the ass? It's well documented that long covid causes Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and Histamine Intolerance (HIT) issues. It's well known that people react to the fillers in thyroid medications. It's well known that people react differently to different thyroid medications. My doctor doesn't even believe in prescribing T3 and T4 medications. Forget asking my doctor for T3 and anti-TG, ""those aren't needed."" Despite me asking him for these tests three times. I would've never been diagnosed with Hashimoto's if it wasn't for my own efforts. I'm so sick of this crap. 

Everyone thinks, ""Oh, you have Hashimoto's hypothyroidism? Take your levothyroxine, and you'll be fine."" That's not the case for a significant portion of us. Our thyroid is responsible for so many functions. I had no idea!

I've completely overhauled my diet last year. I switched to an anti-inflammation diet. I cut out gluten, dairy, and sugar for 3 months. It didn't improve my symptoms. After getting MCAS, I switched to a low-histamine diet. I've added foods back in as tolerated. I cut out alcohol, caffeine, coffee, and soda. I lost 50lbs. I had a complete vitamin panel. All my levels are in the normal range. I'm careful with which medications and supplements I take. What else can I do? Any and all ranting and/or suggestions or recommendations is appreciated.

A delusion of grandeur that is 'meaning'.,"Pleasure is a chemical mechanism that evolved to promote behaviors that achieve the objective of the DNA, which is the endless propagation of a gladiator war. Rolling the dice such that an entity with a stronger compulsion to continue to replicate is born and so on.

Let's stop pretending that anybody, even scientists for instance ever pursued anything for 'intellectual reasons'. They did it because they felt good. 

What was once a big picture mechanism has evolved to the point that we now assess the fitness of other DNA in real time. From our desire for acknowledgement, validation and acceptance to the desire to be famous and everything in between, it is all a real time competitive system by design. There will always be losers. You cannot 'opt' out because your very own DNA will assess you as having negative fitness. Not only that but you come preprogrammed with code that constantly calculates its own value based upon others perceptions of yourself.

Things that make us happy nearly all of the time are unintentionally contributing to the propagation of the gladiator war. To reject your programming is to reject your happiness. From the cup of coffee you had this morning to your ego trip at work the other day. Pleasure only activates when your DNA believes that some objective of the propagation of the gladiator war is at work. You don't choose what you get to be happy about. It is all rooted in tribality, survival and multiplication. 

I just can't make sense of why I should opt into this stupid gladiator war, a system of endless competition for the sole reason of chemical addictions in the brain, a meaningless reward mechanism, promoting the very same things I hate. Whether I do nothing with my life or do something I should not be judged by fools who are DNA slaves. Their meaning is just a deluded dream of something greater, something they did not even choose. It is a band-aid, and a pure excuse for their own lack of understanding and lack of justification of the truth. The truth is that they all just want the same things as any other animal. From pleasing your parents to wanting to get promoted, all of it is really just a grandiosity of 'meaning' plastered over an animalistic desire to multiply and create more entities for the meat grinder gladiator war that is all life. There is no meaning in this world. There is no rational reason to be doing anything at all. ",0,1743030515.0,nihilism,2,0.17,False

I'm having lactose free dairy milk at home which is fine. But cafes don't have it. The choices are oat, soy, coconut, sometimes almond.

Oat is considered the tastiest milk alternative. But I can only have up to 1/2 cup. I always ask for a flat white, which should be a small amount of milk, but it varies from place to place and sometimes you get a big ol' cup like a latte.

I think soy is no good as our soy milk in the UK is made from whole beans and is high FODMAP. I haven't tried.

Coconut I think similar to oat I can only have a small amount.

Almond I haven't tried but I've heard it's watery.

- Plant(s): wanted to put one in the corner to the right side of the sliding glass door. Thoughts on types? Always loved the look of an olive tree, but not sure if it fits the space (style and space wise)
- Lamp for the couch area: lost here - id like something that goes to the floor and maybe hangs above, but not sure about shape. Any suggestions are appreciated (working with limited space close to the sliding door)
- Kitchen: any ideas to spruce it up?
- Bar stools: will probably replace these eventually - as thinking a burnt orange leather stool. Thoughts? Recc’s?
Misc: Pillow ideas/colours, media stand ideas for shelves, coffee table decor, accents, etc. - Anything else you can think of feel free to shoot me a note!

1jkpgjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1jkpgjl/relationship_edition_what_would_you_do/,Relationship edition: what would you do?,"I, 28f, was lied to by my boyfriend, 28m, of two years for the 5th time a few days ago. We’re gonna call my boyfriend Joe.

Joe and I were friends for about two years before we started dating. We weren’t close up until the last few months of the second year. Towards the last few months is when we began hanging out with a group of friends every weekend and sometimes during the week. He was in a relationship while we were friends and they broke up. After they broke up, we became closer and hung out a lot more. He leaned on me heavy to vent about the break up. He began to like me while I was heavy on not being a rebound and him not getting into anything with me so fresh off the break up. We eventually started the “talking”/dating casually for about three months.

NOW THAT YOU HAVE SOME BACKGROUND-

LIE NUMERO UNO:

While Joe was venting to me, he told me that it is ex emailed him saying that she was getting married. I asked him if he responded and he told me no and I left it at that. Welllll me, Joe and a few friends went to go eat while I got up to go somewhere, my friend brought up his ex and Joe brought up the email to my friend. When he left the table for whatever reason, my friend told me what he said to see if I knew about it and what he told her was that he responded. I asked him about it and he denied it. I was in a weird spot. I knew I didn’t believe him, but I wasn’t gonna continue discussing it.  I had no reason for my friend to lie to me. I wasn’t and couldn’t be mad that he responded because we weren’t in a relationship. I was upset that he lied.

Eventually, one day it slipped that he responded to it, and I pointed out the lie.

Keep in mind that the line didn’t get addressed because it didn’t slip out until after the second lie.

LIE TWO:

Joe likes to use substance recreationally wont disclose which kind because it doesn’t really matter and I’m not sure of the sensory for Reddit. I was gone for the day and I asked Joe if any recreational activities were done. I was told no, later on the same day, I figured out he had lied. This is when I addressed lying to me. I made him aware that I do not tolerates lies. Not even white lies. If I’m lied to, I cannot trust you. I told him I’m not willing to build a relationship with someone who lies and I have no problem leaving over it.

LIE 3:

He went through my phone. I asked him if he went through my phone. He told me no. Eventually admit it and I don’t remember how I handled it.

LIE IV:

This lie was not an outright lie, it was more like I wasn’t told something when something happened, and it was kept for me AND it was asked to be kept from me from someone else. I can’t really go into the details of it because I want to stay anonymous. Money was raised for a really important person in my life, and when all the money was gathered by Joe, it was stolen. He hid the fact that it was stolen for a couple days before I found out.

Conclusion was that we would move forward and he would work to earn my trust again.

LAST LIE - # 5- month of sobriety of any and all things (time frame 2 weeks in)

I come home and see traces of substance, I ask about it and am told by Joe but he had a tiny bit of what was left of whatever was in the house. all night he swore up and down that’s all it was because I would make sly comments here and there saying something about it. It wasn’t an ongoing conversation. Even when I asked the first time I knew I was being lied to by just intuition. The next day he was acting shady. I can’t explain it, but I could just tell something what’s going on. I made it a point to keep my eye out. That’s when I caught him and he eventually admitted he ended up getting more stuff. I was pissed. not because of the action but because he lied about it.

Meanwhile, I’m over here working on myself trying to trust him and then I get lied to. Feels like a slap to the face.

Told him I didn’t wanna be in a relationship with a liar. I wanted him to leave the house and stay somewhere else and we can figure out where to go from there. I left the house because I did not want to be around him. He text me that he wants me in his life wants to be with me forever yada yada yada. I just send back 😒. I go home and I don’t discuss it any further. Cause what am I going to do beg him to do the right thing or beg him to leave the house. I had already told him what I wanted him to do and he didn’t it. I’m not gonna waste my breath.

We do have had a good relationship outside of this issue and maybe a few others which is typical. We have had great connection and have started building a life together. Plans to be married and maybe have a baby. He does so much to make my life easier. I’m a hard-working girl and work lots of hours so he definitely picks up my slack. He also spoils me. He makes my coffee in the morning and dinner every night. He always makes sure I have what I want and need in various ways. Not a bad dude.

As of now, I don’t even know how I feel. I’m numb. I don’t feel love. I don’t feel hate. I don’t feel like. I don’t feel dislike. I’m not necessarily angry. I hate being lied to. It causes me to become a bit paranoid because I already have anxiety. It makes it worse and it makes me think all sorts of things. Also, why should I try to trust someone when they are breaking my trust after the fact of me even trying. How can I trust anything that I ask about or how can I trust that he’s going to tell me the things that I should know without having to ask??

Am I overreacting if I end the relationship?

1. TunnelBear: Seems really easy to use, and it looks like they take security seriously.
2. Opera VPN: It’s built straight into the Opera browser, so it’s super convenient.

Anyway, he told me to meet him at the uni cafeteria to catch-up over a coffee which caught me off-guard cause not like we're close friends so what are we catching up on? Goes on to tell me he's liked me ever since we started uni but was waiting for the right time to say it cause I seemed very closed-off in his eyes. 

I kid you not, this kid has no business liking me. Besides the aforementioned differences, I have an extremely dysfunctional family. I never saw love b/w my parents growing up. Their marriage turned out to be like the ones where they stayed together for the kids even though it was a love marriage. If you don't know what it's like growing up in a house like that, I'm happy for you. 

I currently only dream of graduating with my computer science degree, hopefully get a job where I can get paid enough to live a decent average life. My only little wish is to be able to live a little, be able to not feel like a burden to my parents. 

Not only my parents but there's so many problems going on in my siblings lives too. One is barely passing high school, another has been unemployed for 3 years after graduating from uni, lives as a couch potato with our parents.

I cannot for the life of me stand my family's situation anymore. There are fights going on everyday. We can't even have dinner in peace without my parents breaking into an argument. 

I live on campus and I even dread coming home. I get depressed when home cause unlike at uni where I'm not constantly reminded of how miserable my life is, at home I have to come to terms with the fact that I cannot afford to have fun because I should be busy trying to get away from whatever's going on at home.

Anyway, I told him I'm not good with emotions and that even though he would be considered a great guy by most girls, I cannot get into dating right now or anything like that. I just don't have it in me to even think about my feelings ’cause I was never taught how to love. I don't know what it looks like when two people are in love (keeping fiction aside). I don't think we'd be a good match given our differences too. 

We had like a 30 min talk and I just walked away after saying what I had to say. I obviously didn't go into details about my family but we all agree he deserves someone so much better than this. It's to the point where I just don't even wanna be within his radius ’cause I don't wanna ruin whatever he has going on for himself. I'm sure he'll go on to live a great life and hopefully have a great family. 

A small part of me feels bad for rejecting him because whatever he said to me in the cafeteria that day seemed quite genuine. Although I'm not the best when it comes to judging guys so Idk. 

It was my first time being told by someone they like me and honestly I'm clueless as to why this is. But like I said, I'm not the greatest with feelings so maybe there's something I'm missing here. I still have classes with him and probably will do for the next couple of years and hopefully this doesn't turn into anything bitter. 

Thank you for reading. Thank you for your time. I cannot talk about this with my siblings cause.. Idk they already have shit going on in their lives. 

Peace. Have a good day. ",1,1743030060.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

I feel sick to my stomach and nauseas about it. I don't even want to drink , I literally just want my horrible flashes of anxiety to go away. 

I haven gotten a break now from my kids in almost a month, plus we had spring break 2 weeks ago and they where with me the entire time. Everything was fine until the last few days I feel like I just can't handle it anymore. 

I bought a 4 month old puppy on impulse and the stress from that is really building up. I have 3 kids and there finally at there dad's this weekend I just don't know if the puppy is feasible. 

I know I need to quit coffee and ciggerates as well they really add to the anxiety but it's been so hard trying to do that. 

All I wanted to do was just to lay down in my bed and then I realized the puppy had peed in my bed. ",1,1743029988.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False
1jkpbnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoonieMemeCoin/comments/1jkpbnh/moonie_the_meme_coin_thatll_ruin_you_in_a_good_way/,MOONIE: The Meme Coin That’ll Ruin You (In a Good Way),"Listen up, degens: MOONIE isn’t something you buy with SOL. You buy it with *guts*. Right now, as you’re reading this, some absolute madlad is smashing that Buy button. They’re not smarter than you. They’re not richer. They’re just faster—and every second you sit there scratching your head, they’re stacking MOONIE, laughing like lunatics, and flexing gains that’ll make your eyes bleed. Don’t let them leave you in the dust.

MOONIE isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a **dare**. A middle finger to the normies who play it safe with their index funds. It’s the vibe check that separates the legends from the “I’ll buy it when it’s stable” losers. You either get it, or you don’t—and if you don’t, well, enjoy watching from the sidelines while we moon.

# 🚀 Why MOONIE? Because It’s So Dumb, It’s God-Tier.

Meme coins are crypto’s version of playing chicken with a freight train. But MOONIE? It’s like doing it blindfolded, on a unicycle, with a lit firecracker in your hand. It’s reckless. It’s absurd. And that’s why it’s **genius**.

* **Utility?** Zero. Nada. Who cares?
* **Roadmap?** Scribbled on a bar napkin at 3 a.m.
* **Whitepaper?** Written in crayon by a toddler on a sugar high.
* **Potential?** Straight to the damn moon, baby.
* **Devs?** Based, unhinged, probably eating glue sticks as we speak.

This isn’t some polished project for suits. It’s for the degens who missed DOGE and swore they’d never miss again. The ones who see “high risk” and hear “high reward.” MOONIE is the crypto version of “hold my beer”—and if you’re not holding, you’re the one getting left behind. Picture this: your buddy’s posting pics of his MOONIE-funded Lambo while you’re still hodling stablecoins. Don’t be that guy.

# 😎 MOONIE Doesn’t Wait. It’s Already Mooning.

Here’s the cold, hard truth: MOONIE doesn’t need you. It’s already got a cult of wild-eyed lunatics riding this rocket to Valhalla. But if you’ve got the stones to join us, here’s how you get in on the action:

1. **Grab some SOL**—you know, that fast, sexy blockchain that’s not Bitcoin.
2. **Hit up Raydium or Jupiter**—links below, no excuses.
3. **Search for MOONIE** with this token address: 56ta7j2vmqqvumqzbkframrboxvpuefpefth7eavsw17.
4. **Swap your SOL for MOONIE** like your life depends on it—because your crypto cred does.
5. **Pray to the meme gods** (or don’t—they’re too busy mooning).

**Real Talk:** If you’re still reading this and haven’t bought yet, you’re already late. Some degen just 10x’d while you were sipping your coffee. FOMO’s clawing at your chest—don’t fight it. Give in.

# 📉 The Stats (Because You’ll Pretend They Matter)

* **Market Cap:** Low now, irrelevant later. It’s going up.
* **Liquidity:** Deep enough to drown your skepticism.
* **Community:** A pack of howling, MOONIE-obsessed psychos.
* **Vibes:** Off the charts.
* **Your Future:** Either a yacht or a ramen diet. Pick your poison.

# 🤝 Join the MOONIE Cult—or Get Wrecked Watching

This isn’t financial advice. This is a **call to arms**. MOONIE isn’t here to hold your hand—it’s here to slap you awake. It’s for the ones who thrive on chaos, who laugh at “safe bets,” who know that in crypto, the crazier it is, the higher it flies. Fortune favors the bold, and MOONIE favors the borderline insane.

So, what’s it gonna be? Will you be the one holding bags—or waving the MOONIE flag from the top of the mountain? 🏁

**TL;DR:** MOONIE is dumb as hell. Buy it anyway. You’ll thank me when you’re mooning—or curse me when you’re broke. Either way, you’ll feel alive. 🚀",2,1743029954.0,MoonieMemeCoin,0,1.0,False

I have been living in my car (2005 Jeep Grand cherokee) for about 10 months now.  It started as a temporary thing while I worked a temporary summer job,  but has extended throughout the winter and now into the spring.

It has been great,  has given me a lot of gratitude for things that I once took for granted, made me more adaptable and resourceful, and yet--

I feel trapped.  I feel like I have gotten all I can get out of this experience and that now for me, I am starting to suffer.  Its getting hot here, I'm sick,  I just want to lay down in a bed on my days off but I cant,  constantly on the move from coffee shop, to library, to gym, to park, to campsite,  with little to nowhere to be in between.  I got rejected a few days ago from the job that I thought was going to take me out of this situation and feel really upset about it,  and now back to the drawing board sending out more applications.
