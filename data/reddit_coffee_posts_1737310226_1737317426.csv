1i57m5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i57m5v/deerman/,Deerman,"# The Deer Man

Julie drummed her fingers against the steering wheel, her dark straight hair falling like a curtain around her face as she sighed at the endless stretch of highway. The three-hour drive from Burberry to her mom's house in Northwoods First Nations always felt longer when she was alone – and lately, being alone had become an all-too-familiar state.

Highway 13 stretched out for miles before merging onto Highway 6. She made a quick pit stop in Hollowsville, a quaint paper mill town, for a much-needed coffee and bathroom break, then continued. The rocky landscape between Hollowsville and her childhood home in the Northern Woods was always stunning in the fading twilight – her mother loved to call them the Wajiwiinsan (Little Mountains) in Ojibwe. Even with the trees bare, the scenery was a spectacular sight and a refreshing change from the city's smog and busy traffic.

Julie stopped at the small bridge connecting the mainland to the island, and idled patiently, waiting for the light to change. During the busy summer months, the bridge swung open every hour to accommodate an influx of large seasonal boats. But in November, just after sunset, it appeared deserted, as did the sleepy town of Little River that lay just beyond it. Her phone beeped in the seat next to her, a text message.

**Mom:** ""Watch out for deer on the road! Love you.""

Julie's thumbs moved deftly over the keypad: ""No worries. See you soon. Xo.""

Driving alone at night made her acutely aware of her solitude. The occasional flicker of wildlife eyes was the only break in the emptiness. Then, about a half mile ahead, she spotted something enormous standing in the middle of the road; a buck, the biggest she'd ever seen. The car slowed to a complete stop a safe distance away, and she peered over the dash, surveying him carefully. He was tall and magnificent. Antlers stretched majestically upward from his head, looking regal and poised like a picture frozen in time.

Julie nodded. ""Boozhoo, Waawashkesh,"" she said with a tone of respect. His gaze fixed somewhere beyond the glare at the windshield, a sight that sent an inexplicable shiver down Julie's spine. Then, suddenly, the buck sprang toward her; the sickening thud of his body collapsing against the hood was followed by the shattering of her windshield. Glass pieces peppered her skin as his antlers thrust through the broken glass, mere inches from her face. Lydia screamed in terror as she pushed back in the seat as far as she could. Her hand fumbled with the door; there was an awful grinding sound as it shimmied it open. The buck's convulsions caused the hood to groan under its weight. It stared blankly, eyes bloodied and bulging in a way that would haunt her forever.

Julie stumbled out onto the roadway and into a pair of oncoming headlights. A horn blared loudly, causing her heart to jump. She lunged out of the way as the other vehicle flew past and came to a screeching halt. She collapsed onto the cold pavement.

The last thing she saw was a blurry shape approaching, and a man's warbled voice spoke as she faded into unconsciousness, ""Miss? Miss? Are you alright? Help is on the way.""

\---

The rattle of a med cart and the murmur of voices outside her room jolted her out of a nightmare. When she opened her eyes, the images floated, impressed like a misty mirage before her. But instead of a deer, a young man about her age stood there unflinching against a vast, empty darkness with his arms folded across his chest. ""Lora,"" his voice echoed like a chant in a big room. The car rushed toward him. The brakes were failing; she couldn't stop the collision from happening.

""Miss Wabigwan?"" Nurse Lumley's voice broke through the haze. Julie blinked, and the dream dissipated like a fine mist. She struggled to sit up, wincing at the stiffness in her neck.  

""Your neck is giving you trouble, huh?""

Julie nodded. ""Yes, where am I?""

Still groggy, she looked around the room and realized it was a hospital room.

""We'll get you something for the pain in a minute. And you're at Little River Hospital. They brought you in late last night. The medics said you hit a *deer* on the road."" She said it in a way that implied that Julie was lucky to be alive.

The deer. Julie remembered it all now. The deer had charged at her. ""Yeah, he came at me."" Gingerly, she touched the cuts on her face, wincing.

Nurse Lumley offered a sympathetic smile. ""Well, you're safe now, dear, and don't you worry about those nasty cuts; they'll be gone in no time.""  

Julie's mother, Mary walked into the room, carrying two large coffees in a tray. ""Good, you're awake."" She set the tray on the bedside table and sat next to her.

Nurse Lumley finished fluffing and straightening the pillows. ""There, all nice and comfy now."" She straightened. ""The doctor's going to be in soon to see you. Click the button if you need anything in the meantime."" She pointed to the call button at Julie's side. Julie nodded, and the nurse departed.

Her mom opened the tabs on both coffees, letting the steam escape. Julie rested back against the pillows.

""So how are you feeling, Julie?"" her mother looked her over, concern etching lines across her face. As a young widow and single mother, her daughter's well-being was always her main priority. There had been many uphill struggles along the way. However, Julie had grown into a beautiful young woman only months away from her bachelor's degree in creative writing; Mary couldn't have been prouder.

Julie thought carefully for a moment, ""Well, to be honest, Mom, I feel like I've been run over by a tow truck."" They both chuckled. ""But now I really just want to get out of here and go home.""

""Well, just wait for the doc to come in and look you over first,"" Mary winked.

As if right on cue, Doctor Swanson strode into the room, wearing a standard white coat with a clipboard clutched in his hand.

""Hello,"" he said, sounding almost chipper, setting the clipboard on the counter beside him before leaning against it casually. ""So, how are we feeling this morning, Julie?"" She noticed his lacklustre blue eyes, a clear sign of sleepless hours. She knew that look all too well, having spent many sleepless nights focused on her studies, living on coffee and cigarettes just to get by. Still, she had to credit him for at least trying to sound upbeat.

""I could be better, but I think I'm okay.""

""Well. Good, let's take a look then."" He walked over and applied gentle pressure to Julie's neck and back. She tried to not wince at the tender parts. When finished, he stepped back and thoughtfully weighed in on the evidence before passing final judgment. ""You may have some neck stiffness for a little while, but pain meds should take care of that, and plenty of rest."" He cast a side glance at Julie's mother, undoubtedly knowing she'd see to that.

Nurse Lumley re-entered, holding a small pill cup and a glass of water. ""Sorry, doctor, but an officer is waiting outside to speak to Julie."" She placed the pills and water down, then turned on her heel to exit.

""Well, I guess that's my cue to leave. Take care, Julie, and if anything comes up, then just come back.""

Julie downed her meds and then nodded. ""I will.""

Officer Josh Miigizi came in after Dr. Swanson left. Julie's face lit up. ""Josh!"" she exclaimed

""Hey Julie, long time no see."" He smiled warmly, then turned and nodded at her mom, ""Mrs. Waabigwan.""  

""Aanii Josh, come on in."" She nodded back and smiled; it made her heart glad to see Julie smiling again. Then she got up and conveniently excused herself to find a washroom so they could talk. Julie patted a clear spot on her bed next to her. ""come, sit,"" she commanded.

They spent the next while discussing the details of the accident at length for the report. They then graciously moved on to lighter subjects, like what's been transpiring in their lives up to the present. Julie gave him a quick three-minute summary about her pursuing a Creative Writing degree in Burry, a three-hour commute away. Josh shared he had joined the police force right after high school and returned to the island after his father's passing. He'd inherited his dad's house and lived there ever since.

""Hey, how about I swing by with coffee tomorrow? We can catch up some more.""

Julie nodded, a hint of a smile on her lips. ""Sure, why not?"" They quickly exchanged cell numbers. Suddenly, Josh's police radio crackled at his side; he immediately answered it and then had to leave in a hurry.

Moments later, Mary reappeared, looking more refreshed. ""Well? Are you ready to go, daughter?""

""Absolutely!"" Julie carefully got up to get ready. The pills eased the discomfort but some stiffness remained.

\---

It was good to be back on the rez again; on the way home, they stopped at Mogey's Variety just past two o'clock corner for some groceries and snacks. The sky was a slate grey; its smooth surface stretched for miles without a break in the cloud surface. It gave the land and the leafless trees a shadowy, colourless feel. Julie wished she had brought her sketchbook and pencils along for the trip.

""You need anything else before we go home?"" Her mom interrupted her reverie as she fiddled with the music playlist, trying to get it to play again.

""We're in the dead zone, Mom; you'll have to wait a few secs for the sound to kick in again,"" Julie pointed upward, signifying there was no service.

Oh, yeah, that's right, you'd think I'd remember that by now,"" her mom said, relaxing back into her seat again. Sure enough, the music automatically resumed playing only moments later.

The house seemed quiet, as if it were asleep. Her uncle's dog, Benji, from next door, waited near the front steps, his tail wagging cheerfully.

""Awe, Benji,"" her mom's tone was soft-spoken.

Benji waited for the car to park before circling around to greet Julie. She patted him gently. He was old in years, but still a happy boy, nonetheless.

The door was left unlocked like it usually was during the day, and the familiar scent of cinnamon air freshener told her she was home. Her mom headed to her room to put her purse away, calling back over her shoulder, ""Oh, before I forget, Josh dropped off your bag last night; it's by the couch."" Julie sighed with immense relief; her laptop and favourite books were in that bag, including a couple of first editions.

It had been quiet that night, and yet she couldn't sleep; the images of the accident kept seeping back into her thoughts. She remembered the name ""Lora"" and wondered what it all meant. She flipped over to her other side, facing the bookshelf, and spotted the pack of smokes she had left stashed on the second shelf a month ago. It rested on her copy of 'Bear Walker,' she slid one out.

Even though it had been a month since she quit, she couldn't resist the urge to have just one, especially now after the deer and car accident. And then the haunting nightmare, to boot. The whole thing was just too eerie for words. The first drag was the best; it made her feel grounded and connected to the present moment, as did the cold night. She thought about what Josh had said at the hospital. Maybe he was right; perhaps the car lights spooked the deer into panic, and it lost all direction. It really was the only reasonable explanation, the only one that made any sense, anyway. Her phone bleeped in her pocket. It suddenly occurred that she hadn't checked her messages since yesterday. Josh's name appeared on the screen: Hey, hope you all settled in. How about I drop by with coffee around 1ish tomorrow?

**Julie**: Sure! I take mine, black. :)

**Josh:** Okay, see ya then. ;)

SNAP. Julie jumped with a start, nearly dropping her phone. Her eyes immediately scanned the darkness for whatever it was. The hairs on her neck prickled up; she had the uncanny sensation of being watched. Her cigarette had burnt down to the nub, singing her fingers. She shook her hand and winced, then hurried back into the house, locking the doors behind her.

A tall figure stood out from the shadows, unaffected by the cold. Watching the house, his attention immediately drawn to the window where a single light was lit in one room; a woman's slender silhouette grazed by the curtains, and then the light went out.

\---

The savoury scent of bacon sizzling and freshly brewed coffee pulled Julie from sleep. Again, she'd been dreaming of 'him' - the attractive man with dark hair and deep-set eyes, only this time he motioned for her to follow him into dense woods. In the peaceful scene behind him, colourful birds took flight, and a young fawn, its large brown eyes sparkling with innocence, darted amongst the sun-dappled trees. The dream felt so real; she reached out with a pang of yearning to follow him into those woods. Yet, like water between her fingers, the dream slipped away, leaving only the ache of wanting.

During breakfast, her mom spoke enthusiastically about a gathering she was heading to this morning with the aunties, and she invited Julie to tag along with them. She declined her mom's offer, explaining that she had already made plans to spend the day with Josh. Mary playfully nudged her daughter, insinuating that they might wind up becoming a thing. Julie laughed. Though Josh was good-looking, the idea of dating right now seemed ludicrous. Since the beginning of her studies, there was little time for much else. Period.

That afternoon, Josh and Julie took a leisurely stroll through the woods behind the house with coffees in hand. The sun glared in the clear November sky, casting a cool haze over everything. ""So, how are ya today? Still hurtin?""

Instinctively, Julie touched her neck. ""Well, the pills help a bit; it's not that bad now,"" she replied.

""Good."" He kicked a stone out of the path and kept walking.

She continued, ""I haven't slept too well the past couple of days, though.""

""Really? Why's that?"" He glanced at her briefly, then took a sip of coffee; steam rose, mingling with his breath.

""It's nothing major, really."" She shrugged, then took a swig from her own cup; three-quarters of the way done, she could feel the effects of the caffeine already kicking in, giving her a slight energy boost..

""Come on, just lay it out."" He nudged her encouragingly.

They stopped at a large fallen tree and sat down in the middle. That's when Julie opened up about her dreams and the mysterious deerman. When she finished, she downed the rest of her coffee and gazed thoughtfully out at the trees. Waiting for his response.

Finally, after a moment or two, he spoke. ""This man you're dreaming about reminds me of a story my grandpa Joe told me a few years back when we were out at his camp.""

Julie's interest suddenly piqued. ""Oh yeah? I don't think I've heard it. How does it go?""

He shivered in his jacket. ""Well, how about we head back, and I'll tell you on the way?""

She nodded, ""Deal.""

Waashkesh Nini

On a fall day back in the 70s, a chilling presence settled over the reserve. Word started spreading throughout the community: reports of an unusually large deer, unlike anything seen before. The first sighting happened in the woods just behind the apartment complex at the southern end of the community.

Hoofprints left behind, undeniably from an animal, like a deer or an elk, but much larger than that. The elders talked in quiet voices; their weathered faces etched with concern. A spirit animal, a visitor from the unknown.

Some villagers believed the deer was a kind of protector, while others viewed it as evidence of sorcery at play or a shapeshifter. Suspicion rippled through the tranquil reserve of what or who it could be.

One quiet evening, a young native woman named Lora stood outside her home wrapped in a wool blanket, as she so often did, to gaze up at the stars. Lately, a kind of loneliness had settled over her life.

At twenty-two, she lived alone in a house inherited from her late grandmother. Being adopted at the young age of three, she had no memories of her real birth family, and her shyness always made it difficult to get to know people. More than anything, she craved companionship and romance. Lora often wished for a handsome, tall man to come into her life and sweep her off her feet.

The following Saturday, after the sun sank over the horizon, Lora sat on the deck again with a cup of steeped tea, this time gazing at the distant glow of the local dancehall. She imagined people dancing there and having fun under the glowing lights and wondered what it must be like.

""If only someone would ask me to the dance,"" she whispered to the evening breeze, ignoring her late grandmother's wise counsel to always be careful what she wished for. Instead, whether or not she realized it, Lora sent her intent out into the void of all things. Her invitation beckoned to a place deep in the woods where the oldest things still lived. A shooting star trailed across the sky like a silver ribbon, and she felt a warm energy begin in the pit of her stomach. A familiar yearning emerged.

That evening, as she lay in bed staring at the tiled ceiling, images of couples dancing filled her mind. ""…handsome man,"" she murmured before drifting into a restless sleep. The stillness of the night thickened with anticipation. An intrusive rapping on her door echoed through her dreams like thunder. Lora jerked awake. It was strange for anyone to visit this late, but out of curiosity, she pulled on her shawl, cautiously approached the door, and turned on a light.

As the door swung open, she gasped in surprise. Before her stood, undoubtedly, the most attractive man she'd ever laid eyes on, his skin a warm tan, his eyes gleaming like polished obsidian. An air of mystery surrounded him.

""Hey, I'm Devin,"" he said, a charming smirk playing on his lips. ""I know it's *really* late, but I'm trying to get to a dance hall. Could I bother you for directions?"" A crop of dark hair fell over his eyes as though it were deliberate, catching. The fading light.

Lora swooned slightly and wondered if this was all a dream. A handsome man shows up at her door late at night, asking for directions. A feeling of doubt niggled at the pit of her stomach.

She suddenly remembered stories her grandmother told of mysterious, handsome young men in black who were not really men at all, who would seduce women and take them, never to be seen again.   

""Uh, look, I'm not up for going anywhere tonight. ,""Sorry, I can't help you,"" Lora replied hesitantly and started closing the door. His gaze locked onto hers with a magnetic pull. He stepped closer, and a mysterious air of energy hung around him. ""You should come to the dance with me. It'll be fun. Just forget everything else."" In that instant, the energy shifted, enveloping her in a heady aura of intoxicating and alluring magnetism. He was… irresistible. Lora felt her resolve melting away. ""Okay… I'll go,"" she said, despite the smallest protest in the back of her mind. I'll get ready.

As they climbed into his shiny, black pickup truck and drove off, her mind was floating lost somewhere in a white fog on the outer fringes of her consciousness, but she could still sense and feel things: the truck jolting along the dirt road, the smell of the vehicle's interior, and the warmth of a man's rough worn hand intermingled in hers. A single memory fragment floated past, and her mind latched on, holding fast. And then she remembered something. Devin. It's Devin, and then it all faded to black.

\---

As they arrived at the dance hall, her earlier memories had all but faded and been replaced by new ones: Devin knocked on the door, asking for directions. They hit it off, and then he graciously invited her to the dance, and she happily accepted.

The thrum of music pulsed from the speakers; under the warm lantern glow, the dance floor was alive with people adorned in cowboy hats and boots, moving and swaying with the music. Lora felt an overwhelming thrill in Devin's presence. Tonight, she felt like the prettiest woman in the room. As they moved across the dancefloor, all eyes drew to them. Women watched with envious sighs while men regarded Lora with looks of admiration.

Yet unease flickered to life within her as the night went on. She noticed Devin's eyes had changed–more comprehensively, with a new glint of darkness lurking in their depths. The atmosphere in the room shifted, but Lora tried to brush it all off as a side effect of the music. Still, an inexplicable tension now hung in the air; it was tangible enough that even the other dancers sensed something was off kilter.

As the music died, their dancing slowed to a stop. Devin leaned in close and whispered in her ear, ""Midnight's almost here. Time for us to go."" She broke free from his embrace and stepped back, confused. ""What do you mean? She turned and glanced at the clock, both hands now pointed to Midnight.

""Oh, oh. Too late!"" His tone dripped with amusement as he took a few steps back.

The crowd had now cleared a circle around them. In that instant, Devin's body contorted and shifted where a man once stood; a hideous creature now emerged. Antlers spawned grotesquely from his head, casting eerie shadows across the dance hall. His feet twisted into hooves and clattered noisily against the wooden floor as he took two steps towards Lora. Fear descended, replacing the buoyant atmosphere and sending ripples of horror through the crowd. Lora stumbled back in terror and awe.

The crowd erupted in utter panic. The frantic rush to get away turned the space into a scene of chaos. People stumbled into one another, sending fall harvest decorations and balloons twirling and swaying wildly in their mad rush to escape. Lora remained frozen, torn between fear and the haunting sense of connection she felt with this strange creature that now stood before her.

Devin looked around pleasantly, pleased, his arms raised to address an empty room. ""Ah, good. Now that we're alone. We can talk.""

""Wha… what?"" she asked, her voice croaking shakily. Then she cleared it and tried again to sound steadier this time."" What is it you want?""

""You've experienced the night's enchantment, but now I want something in return.""

Panic rose in Lora as the weight of his words settled in. She dared to ask,

""What is it?""

""You."" He mused. ""I have travelled far and wide to find a woman like you who will balance me. Someone worthy,"" he said. ""Come with me now. You will never be alone again.""

A wave of dread washed over her at the thought of being tied to Devin, a sorcerer and shapeshifter. Trembling, she stepped back and shouted, ""No!"" struggling to stay calm. ""I won't go with you!""

Devin's expression shifted from amusement to fury as the lights flickered. A hearty laugh reverberated off the walls of the dance hall.

""You dare refuse me, Lora? You'll face the consequences.""

 

""No one will love you, Lora. You'll always be alone, just like you always have been.""

 

Summoning all her courage, Lora declared, ""If I'm going to love someone, then it should be of my own choosing, not anyone's or any *thing* else'*s*.""

She turned on her heel and pushed through the hall doors, running out into the night. It no longer held any of its magic for her. Looming shadows seemed to stretch and stretch, morphing into eerie shapes. She could hear strange noises, rustling in the trees, and the familiar sound of hooves crunching on gravel from behind her, getting closer. Frightened, she ran on, never daring to look back.

Suddenly, to her great relief, a set of blurry car lights came into view half a mile down the road. Lora waved her hands frantically in the air until the vehicle slowed to a stop. Sweating and breathless, she stumbled over to the passenger side, glanced over her shoulder, and got in. As the car turned around, her eyes briefly scanned the road in the headlights, but thankfully, there was no sign of the creature anywhere.

 

After arriving home, she thanked the driver and got out. A wave of relief washed over her as she walked down the driveway. The familiar sight of the house, filled with precious memories of her grandmother, was a great comfort. Standing beneath the moon's glow, Lora realized, at that moment, that love wasn't merely something to wish for but a journey of self-discovery that she'd have to undertake to truly understand.

She began her first week of school at a nearby college a month later. The first bell buzzed as she slammed her locker shut. She rushed down the hall late for her first class, incidentally, colliding with another student exiting a room from the right. Books flew off in all directions.

""Oh, my god. I'm so sorry, ""a young man, Lora's age, glanced down apologetically. Without looking, she quickly bent to retrieve the textbooks.

The young man squatted beside her, grabbed one, and handed it back. ""Uh, here you go,"" he said nervously.

She looked down at the hand holding the book and raised her eyes to meet his. She noted their colour, sea green---her favourite color.

""Thanks,"" she replied shyly and took it.

""Um, I'm Stephen,"" he extended his right hand.

""Lora,"" she smiled.  

 

 

""The End.""

""Wow,"" Julie exclaimed. Clapping. ""That is an amazing story!""

Josh grinned, ""yeah, Gramps always was a skilled storyteller.""

Julie nodded thoughtfully. ""The story… it's not real, though, is it?""

According to Gramps, it happened back in the 70s; the girl Lora supposedly died in a car accident two years after it happened; it was long before we were born. In fact, you are living two houses away from where she did, Josh said matter-of-factly. He stopped and turned to face her; his expression was quizzical. ""You really never knew?""

Julie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. ""Uh, no,"" she replied, her voice inflecting slightly, ""I had no idea. And the name Lora. That's the name I heard in my dream.""

""Yeah, I know,"" Josh said and grew silent. They continued walking, each lost in their own quiet reflection.

Josh stopped dead in his tracks twenty meters from the woods' edge. His eyes riveted to the ground; with a murmured exclamation, he sank into a crouch.

""Why did you stop?"" Julie asked, coming to stand beside him. Josh hadn't replied, his attention focused on the ground. She traced his gaze to where he'd cleared away some leaves, revealing large hoofprints.

""Oh, my goodness."" Julie followed his lead and hunkered down to study the outline of the prints more closely. She splayed her hand over it; it was almost a perfect fit. Slowly, their eyes met, then turned to look at the house. Together, they brushed some more twigs and dried leaves out of the way, searching for more evidence of prints, but found none.

""How can that be?"" Josh asked, dumbfounded. They both exchanged bewildered glances.

Julie shook her head. ""That's so weird.""

""Julie, "" her mother called out to her, carrying an arm full of groceries in from the car. They both rose to their feet and walked back in silence.

Later that evening, **Josh texted:** Hey, my grandfather is back home from out west. You should come out for a visit. He brought back some homemade elk jerky! ;)

Julie knew that Josh's grandpa was a respected elder in the community.

It had been a long time since she'd sat with an elder. Amidst the growing peculiarities in her life lately, now was probably a good time as any to seek wisdom again.

**She texted back:** Okay, I'll be there soon.

With a trade blanket and some tobacco, Julie snuck out quietly and set off down the highway in her mother's car to Josh's grandfather's place on Mukwa Road. Just past Miigwan's craft shop, the darkness suddenly thickened with unexpected fog. It seemed surreal to see fog in mid-November, but climate change was worsening. Julie slowed her speed, moving cautiously through the formless shapes in the mist. Until one shape appeared to become more solid and took the familiar form of a man. He stood off to the side of the road and waved his hand to get her attention. Despite her initial wariness, she pulled over and rolled down the passenger window. He seemed non-threatening and claimed to be headed in the same direction. Acting against her better judgment, perhaps because of sympathy, she offered him a lift.  

Julie dared a quick glance at him, her eyes refocused back on the road. There was something vaguely familiar about the guy, though she was sure she'd never seen him before. He looked young, about her age. Even with his mussed hair partially swept over his eyes, she could tell he was a handsome Nish, mysterious, and kind of sexy; her mind wandered, entertaining thoughts she hadn't had since school began. ""So, uh, what's your name?"" she asked, trying to keep her mind from lingering in places it probably shouldn't be.

His voice then dropped to a mumble; words indistinguishable as his hands moved as though they were signing in a type of unknown language. A wave of dizziness swept over Julie, and her skin became flushed.

They came to a fork in the road. ""Turn left here,"" he gestured toward a deserted dirt road opposite her turnoff. Though it was out of her way, she did as she was told, an inexplicable pull guiding her hands on the wheel.

""Stop here,"" he commanded. Julie pulled off to the side of the deserted road. It was pitch black out, and no other vehicles were in sight. Unable to move, Julie could only wait for whatever dark fate awaited her. From her peripheral vision, the man beside her appeared to be nothing more than a blurry shape in dark clothing, his face obscured by the shadows.

In the eerie silence that hung there between them, her phone rang, the high, shrill buzz temporarily breaking the spell of enchantment. She seized the moment to escape and flung open the car door and ran for the trees, her feet splashing through a partially frozen puddle. The cold water prickled at her damp feet, but she didn't care.

""Lora,"" He called out behind her. You can run but won't get away from me this time.""

Thin branches whipped at her face, stinging the newly healed cuts on her cheeks as she rushed further into the trees; the frozen earth crunched beneath her feet. Darkness engulfed her. She tripped on a loose deadwood in the path and fell to the ground with a thud. The earth felt cold and rough beneath her. Quickly, she struggled to her feet, leaning against an old oak for support. Its cold, twisted bark pressed to her back as she struggled to ascertain her thoughts. Why did he call her Lora? Was there any truth to this? Doubt crept into her thoughts. Or was this all an illusion? A cruel sorcerer's trick.

""Lora, there's no use hiding."" He called out.

With each step into the woods, the man's body shifts and contorts. His limbs lengthen, his torso narrowing as he takes on the tall, muscled form of a deerman. His transformation into a half-man, half-deer creature is a blend of flesh and wilderness magic. Branches cracked beneath the weight of his hooves as he came to stand in an open space 15 meters away from where Julie hid. Steam snorted through his nostrils as he turned his head, sniffed the air, and continued disappearing into the foliage.

She clung to the tree, desperate to keep from sight. Her heart pounded furiously, threatening to burst from her chest.

Three miles down the road, in a rustic log cabin beneath a tin roof, an elderly man sat before an open altar of sacred items; he picked up the turtle shell rattle handed down through generations and grasped it in his weathered hand. The rattle shakes, and he chants in a low, raspy voice, singing from his heart centre, imploring the ancestors to help shield Julie. The potent medicine from the rattle swirls about the cabin and goes forth into the night. In the meantime, Josh had already bolted from the cabin in search of Julie, racing against time to find her before it was too late.

Julie trembled behind the tree; the cold pricked at her toes like sewing needles and stung her blood-stained cheeks, but she dared not move a muscle until it was gone. After a few moments of unsettling silence, she mustered up enough courage to peer out, her eyes strained to see into the trees. When there was no sign of the creature, she made her way out into the open, cautiously looking around so more for fear that it might come back.

Josh peered over the dash in the headlights, looking for any sign of Julie. He spotted a car ahead parked off the roadside, the driver's door ajar. He immediately got out and grabbed his rifle and a flashlight, then ran after the footprints leading into the forest.

Twigs snapped and rustled behind Julie. Her heart leaped as she realized she wasn't alone. Slowly turning, her gaze met two glowing yellow eyes, like separate entities, hovering five feet above her. For the first time, she witnessed the thing chasing her. It was a partial man's body with the head of a deer, complete with gnarled antlers that twisted upward, grotesque and misshapen. His arms were sparsely covered in deer fur and had become more elongated. Looking down, she saw Hooven feet. Julie then screamed in sheer terror at the monstrous being that stood before her in all its horrifying glory. She thoroughly believed that the devil had come to steal her soul.

Joe sang with even greater intensity, his eyes still closed. He shook the rattle vigorously, its high-energy vibrations piercing the ether. Powerful chanting carried through the night to encircle the creature. The spiritual assault had begun; it stumbled back, shaking its enormous head in blind confusion and fury; antlers broke the nearby branches. Josh broke into the clearing, calling Julie in earnest. He spotted her a few feet away from the beast and raised his shotgun, firing a single shot at the creature, grazing its arm. The sound echoed through the night; the monster stumbled back, shrieking in pain. Josh ran to Julie. Dropping the shotgun, he grabbed her in his arms, shielding her.

The aura around the creature shivered and vibrated with preternatural intensity; suddenly, it let out a chilling scream–a horrifying cross between a man's cry and a deer's wail. Julie and Josh clamped their hands over their ears, recoiling from the sound. Then, in frantic desperation, accepting defeat, it bolted, crashing through the underbrush with mad abandon. The Deerman tore through the woods, driven by a primal urge to escape.

Julie collapsed in Josh's arms, and he held her close, rubbing her back with reassurance, ""it's over now, Julie, he said reassuringly, ""It's over.""

""Not this time, Waawasshkesh Nini, not this time,"" Grandpa Joe spoke, seeing that Julie and Josh were together and safe; he lowered his rattle, his face shining from perspiration. He nodded. It is done.

A Little About Me:

Hey you! I’m a 36-year-old professional overthinker from Europe, armed with a PhD in sarcasm and a master's degree in memeology. I love my motorcycle more than I love most people (sorry, not sorry). When i'm not riding my motorcycle, i'm either traveling, gaming, or pretending I’m an extrovert with friends. 

I asked a librarian once if the library had any books on paranoia; she whispered, “They’re right behind you.”.... i hvn't visited a library eversince...🤣🤣🤣fuckthat! 

My life’s chaotic, but I’m here to embrace the chaos with laughter and questionable life decisions.

Quickfire Facts About Yours Truly:

🏍 Motorcycles are my therapy. Don’t ask me how many I’ve almost bought on impulse.

🎮 Board/video games champion. (Trash talk included for free.)

☕ Starbucks owns my wallet.

🍕 Pineapple on pizza does belong there, fight me.

🍷 Red wine > beer. No arguments.

📸 Your pic gets you mine. Bonus points if you have a cute pet.🐕


About the pineapple on pizza discussion. Just hear me out okay?

Pineapple on pizza is like that one quirky friend you didn't ask for it, but now the party's better because they're there. Plus, it’s fruit, so technically, it makes pizza a salad. You're welcome.....😌🤣

Closing Argument:
If you’re looking for a partner-in-crime who will take you on wild motorcycle rides, crush you at Mario Kart, and debate pizza toppings with unshakable confidence, slide into my DMs. If not, may your coffee be hot, your Wi-Fi fast, and your day lovely. 😊🍷👋🏽

1i57l3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1i57l3r/my_best_friend_started_to_vape/,My best friend started to vape ,"Hey, so as the title already says, my best friend started to vape. That may sound harmless but I think you need a little backstory first.

I am f(15) and she is f(16). I’m gonna call her Lilly to make things easier for you. So Lilly has always been against smoking and vaping and any other stuff that goes in that direction aside from alcohol. In spring of 2024 she tried vaping for the first time at a party. But she didn’t like it at all and hasn’t had the urge to vape ever since.

Now her boyfriend, who I’m gonna call Ethan is pretty much addicted to vaping, which has been pissing her off since they got together, which was 2 months ago or smth. She always got mad when he vaped when she was nearby and like 3 days ago, she vented to me about how much all his vaping stressed her out, so I felt really sorry for her, knowing how disgusting she thinks vaping is and me sharing the same opinion. 

Today, me, Lilly Ethan and a friend were just chilling at her house when suddenly she grabbed the vape of her boyfriend and started smoking it like it was nothing. Then I heard that she had tried it yesterday and thought it ‘felt like being drunk’ and that’s why she likes it now. 
Every few minutes she took either Ethan’s or his friend’s vape and they all just smoked there with me sitting there and having no clue what to do. 

I don’t know why she started doing that. Even Ethan and the other boy told her not to start because she would become addicted. She didn’t really care and just said ‘I’m not gonna get addicted’. But I know that she becomes addicted to things super fast, like coffee and alcohol. Now she bought a vape herself, which she will receive in a few days. 

I just don’t understand how someone can totally change their opinion about something in only 2 days. Also, it was not nice to sit in the smoke for a few hours, I am really nauseous right now. That’s why I won’t tolerate any of them smoking right next to me again and I will tell her, but I feel like as a best friend, I should do more. But I also know that it is her own thing what she does and being over a year older than me, she should know better, but she doesn’t. Maybe I’m exaggerating but I really care about her and of course my health. Because I’m definitely not going to the smoker place in school breaks with her.

1i57j26,https://i.redd.it/482ps2edb0ee1.jpeg,New to tea ,"Greetings. I gifted my mom this tea kettle from Japan, and a large assortment of fancy teas about 15 years ago. We lost mom last year, and when going thru stuff I found the kettle and some Teavana teas. I decided to put this lil guy into action and learn how to make tea properly. Anywho, I heated the water in the kettle, and then like a big dummy, burned my fingers taking the lid off. Then burned my fingers again trying to get the lid off a second time and removing the basket. Am I supposed to heat the water in a different vessel and add to this one for steeping? Or do I simply leave the lid off while heating? How do you remove the basket after steeping? Just carefully? 

Also, I apparently really like tea with a dash of some sort of cream, although I think other non dairy options would work fine like I do with my coffee. Are there any highly recommended teas that go better with cream? I vaguely remember black tea? 

Lastly, Is there a good article or short book summarizing well the various types of teas someone could suggest?

A Little About Me:

• Books and Movies: I’m into Gothic stories, classic horror films, and anything with a bit of mystery or drama. If you’re into Dracula, The Haunting, or anything by Edgar Allan Poe, we’re already off to a good start.

• Cooking and Hosting: I love cooking—especially recipes that feel like they’ve got a story behind them. Whether it’s an old family recipe or something inspired by a cookbook from the ‘50s, I enjoy making meals that bring people together.

• Hobbies That Keep Life Interesting: Fencing, sketching, and wandering through antique shops or bookstores are some of my favorite ways to spend time. I like finding unique things and learning their stories.
      Also some video games

• The Little Things: I believe life’s better with a good playlist, a cozy atmosphere, and someone to share it with.
What I’m Looking For:

Someone who’s curious, creative, and appreciates the little things that make life special. If you’re into thought-provoking conversations, enjoy a good ghost story, or simply love discovering hidden gems (whether they’re books, cafés, or experiences), we might just click.

A Great First Date Idea:
Grabbing coffee or drinks somewhere cozy, checking out a cool gallery or bookshop, and seeing where the conversation takes us. Or, if you’re into it, cooking a meal together and putting on a classic movie in the background.
If this sounds like your kind of vibe, send me a message—I’d love to hear from you.

Put on clothes. Brush teeth. Wash face. Make coffee. Sit down at desk to start the work day. Read the news/see what's going on in the world. Work...avoid work...work...avoid work. Check social media for no reason. Check my stocks that never make money. Avoid laundry. Avoid cleaning cat vomit. Do some online shopping for household items. Avoid opening delivery boxes/mail. More work. Make lunch. Clean kitchen. Clean cat vomit. Open packages. Maybe go for a walk. Back to work. Do some laundry. More work. Maybe work out. Make dinner. Clean dinner. Watch some mindless TV. Pretend to care about sports on TV. Shower. Go to bed. Do it all over again the next day.

Took me circa 38 years to realize just how exhausting existence is. Even making a sandwich for lunch seems like a burden now.

And the weekend days aren't really any less exhausting: more chores, 'keeping up with the jones' lifestyle, etc etc.

I even realized that pretending to care, or even pretending like I know what I'm doing, is exhausting.

And it's just going to get worse as I age. My body is already deteriorating. I avoid going to the doctor. Every year there is a new pain somewhere in the body. The worst part is...I believe in nothing...so all this is essentially for nothing.

So let’s say we go in at 4 and open at 4:30. Or 5 then open at 5:30 see the problem is that we aren’t ever ready to have people Immediately at 4:30 ( sometimes we are sometimes we aren’t ) which happens everyday without fail and they complain or get upset that 1. We aren’t all cheerful and delightful at 4 in the morning and 2. We all “ seem so tired “ ( like be for real yall ) and that we never seem ready to accept customers. Well surprise  surprise we aren’t. My store usually opens with 3 people but due to the other one always being chronically late like shows up at 4:15 ( yes we’ve talked to store manager but nothing , other openers are always late too)  and so we have to cover their task as well so it’s mainly 2 openers and it’s so much more too it especially when bars aren’t cleaned or we don’t have the tablets to clean them and so then we don’t have bars ready or coffee machine is acting up again , like we simply aren’t ready at open. I also have a question for people who always come right when the store opens , do you guys think it’s faster or something? I feel like it takes way longer in the morning cause I’m doing bar, warming , and drive by myself sometimes. People will literally show up when we show up, like there will be 4-5 cars sometimes , wait 30 minutes sometimes demand we open the doors early and just expect us to constantly cater to them. What do you get out of this? And always commenting on how tired the baristas look? Like come on you guys. It’s 4am most of us woke up at 3 sometimes 3:30 cause of a late alarm . Please stop being so Rude about it . Yes we are short staff. No store will ever be complete ready By 4:30 I mean all task done everything. of course while we are making your drinks we are also doing our other task. You can’t be mad not everything is in place like it would be if it was mid day.

Like Us workers are trying our best. It doesn’t help that my store is extremely story staffed for the area and we have like 14 partners when apparently we need around 30+ cause we are like literally right next to a highway but we aren’t able to take people in cause or DM and everyone is being picky.

I just want to say that please don’t come in immediately when we open the doors and expect Hollywood acting and our store to be ready for like 6 customers at the exact same time and all of you being rude or just straight up not talking to us to figure out what you want.

1i57d2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/artbusiness/comments/1i57d2d/hosting_a_workshopclass/,Hosting a workshop/class,"Hey there y’all, a little background information about myself if that I am currently a high school senior trying to get money along with pursue my passion for art.. About a week or two ago I got my hands on a plethora of paintbrushes, a mix between acrylic and watercolor all for free.



I only paint periodically and I don’t want these brushes to go to waste in my closet. That’s when I had the bright idea to possibly host a class/workshop. For the first workshop I was thinking about asking a local coffee shop if they would allow me to host it there. (They could post it as an event on their page and have the painters buy their coffee). 

I did the math and after calculating the cost of paint, easels (6, bigger initial purchase but I can get a lot of use out of them), aprons, canvases, and paint trays, the materials would cost me around $80 If this entire thing went through I’d probably charge around $20 per person with a 6 person maximum leaving me about a $42 profit if all the spots are filled.

My mindset going into this is that I can continue the classes, getting the bang for my buck out of the easels, and make more money down the road. 

In the summer I could also try and host an art camp for kids through my local art council if I receive enough experience.

My name is Dr. Wael Shaaban, and I am a doctor currently residing outside the country. Recently, my family experienced a serious incident. Two days ago, my brother, who is a university student, was kidnapped for four hours. During this time, all the money was stolen from our house, and he was eventually left in the Bab Hood area of Homs. Thank God for his safety.

Here are the details as I received them:

On January 17, 2025, at seven in the evening, two cars arrived with five individuals claiming to be from the Commission. They were wearing uniforms and driving official vehicles. Three of them entered our house while the others remained in the second car outside. They entered my family's home in Homs's immigrant area respectfully. Inside the house were my father, mother, and my brother Akram, a 23-year-old engineering student. 

The perpetrators instructed my family to take out all the money and gold and place it on the table, stating they would search the house to ensure nothing was lost. They proceeded to search the house and inquired about the source of the money. My father explained that it consisted of funds sent by our family members living abroad and earnings from my brother Akram's job at an internet company. 

They acted politely throughout the encounter, even drinking coffee with my family and receiving them warmly. They reassured my family that everything was just a routine procedure and that there was no need for fear. After completing their search, they took away…",1,1737316506.0,Alawites_Forum,0,1.0,False

1i577i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KremersFroon/comments/1i577i0/no_taxi_necessary/,No taxi necessary,"It would appear that the girls didn't take a taxi to the trailhead because they wouldn't have to and while a tourist could, there are vans that run around town, taking people here or there.

In Spanish the vans are called ""collectivo,"" and they have regular stops and routes around Boquete.  The restaurant that is in one day photo, where the girls are sitting on the upper level of ""Boquete Bistro"" is right across the intersection from a van stop.  So, all the girls would have to do after eating, if in fact they ate there that day (April 1), is walk across the street and get on a van.

This is significant, not to the story itself necessarily, but to everything that has been said about how they would get to the trailhead.  Did they take a taxi?  Did the taxi driver alert a gang that two white girls were starting the Pianista Trail?  Did this gang murder them?  It is odd that locals might have a story like this, but we notice that the blame for the disappearance is being put on young males that are dead and cannot speak for themselves.  Of course, they had nothing to do with it and there was no taxi.

If you look at the area, you'll see the restaurant that the girls ate at only it's no longer called Boquete Bistro.  It is now The Perfect Pair Coffee and Chocolate.  The black arrow points to the table upstairs where the girls were sitting and Lisanne was looking at the map.  Possession of that map tells us that the girls had been at the SbtR school at least one day earlier as this is a map that is given to tourists at the school.  It was then that they spoke to Feliciano and made arrangements for both the Pianista Trail and the farm tour, and Hans Kremers says in an interview that he knew the girls had made plans already for the entire week.  This is possible because Boquete offers much in the way of touristy things to do.  One reason the Panama economy is so tourist oriented.

Feliciano had made an appointment with them to walk the trail but was late meeting them, so they went on their own.  He admitted to a tourist when they asked him why the girls disappeared - his answer was, they didn't wait for me.  His medical appointment in David made him run a little late, maybe they drew his blood for some other exam, and he didn't get back to Boquete before 11am.  The girls it seems, got tired of waiting and decided to go on their own.  There are times on the trail a person can go the wrong way, but it seems that the girls always made the right decisions and made it to Mirador in nearly a perfect 2 hours.

Here's the Perfect Pair restaurant and if you pan the image to your left, you will see one black van and one white van.  These are the vans that take tourists around and one of their stops is the Pianista Trail.  You tell they driver that's what you want, and they take you there.  I don't know how much it might cost, if any, to ride one of these, but the point would be to take many people and share the cost of getting around.

The point to knowing about the vans is that the greater likelihood is the girls just got on a van, and this puts to rest all of the discussion about a taxi driver being involved.  Click the link and pan to the left to see the vans.  On the front the vans have their company names -Arco Iris el Bajo (the short rainbow), and Zona Urba (city zone).

1i574eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Salary/comments/1i574eh/28f_from_17hour_barista_to_110k_customer_success/,28F. From $17/hour Barista to $110K Customer Success Manager ,"Just a little over two years ago, I was working as a barista at a small, rundown coffee shop, making $17 an hour. I loved making people’s mornings with a good cup of coffee, but deep down, I hated the life it gave me. I was constantly told by my manager that I was “doing a great job,” but that praise came with no raise, no promotion, no path forward. It was a dead end.

At the time, I was living paycheck to paycheck, sharing a tiny apartment with my younger sister. We were both struggling - me to make ends meet, and her to balance school with a part-time job. My dad had passed away a few years earlier, and I was the one holding everything together. My mom, who was still grieving, couldn’t help much financially. I was the breadwinner. And the weight of it all felt like it was crushing me.

And then there was a night where I just snapped. I’d just finished a grueling 10-hour shift, and as I walked out of the café, I noticed the neon sign above the door flickering like it was about to burn out. I stood there in the cold, the city buzzing around me, and realized that this wasn’t it. This couldn’t be my life forever. I didn’t want to keep waking up in a panic every morning, scraping by, and feeling like I had no control. I needed something different. 

I started researching different career paths, and the more I thought about it, the more it became clear that customer success management could be a perfect fit for me. It was all about helping people, building relationships, and making sure clients had the best experience possible - things I was already good at without even realizing it. But the leap felt huge. I didn’t have any formal experience in the field, and the idea of starting over was intimidating.

I decided to go for it anyway. I started taking free online courses in customer service, customer success, and relationship management. I even reached out to a few people on LinkedIn who were working in the field and asked if I could pick their brains for advice. I revamped my resume, focusing on my customer-facing skills, and applied to every job I could find, even if it felt like a stretch. I was rejected over and over, but every time I got that dreaded ""not selected"" email, I reminded myself - this was just a part of the journey.

Six months later, I finally got a break. I was offered a customer success associate position at a tech company, making $70K a year. I could hardly believe it. It was double what I had been making as a barista, and I was going to be able to leave that grind behind.

I poured everything into that new job. I absorbed everything I could from my colleagues, watched hours of webinars, and learned how to connect with clients on a deeper level. Slowly but surely, I started excelling. My natural ability to make people feel heard became my biggest asset. I was promoted within a year to a senior customer success manager role, making $110K annually.

Now, I’m able to support my mom and sister in ways I never thought possible. My mom’s stress about finances has lifted, and my sister graduated last year, debt-free, because I was able to help her with her tuition. I can finally breathe and enjoy the life I’ve been working toward for so long.

It wasn’t easy. It wasn’t fast. But I finally stepped into a career that values my strengths, and now I’m thriving. And I’ll never take that for granted.

1i573ly,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i573ly,Soft colour grading in television,"I’ve noticed a certain trend in the colour grading style of TV Shows from the late 2000s to the 2010s, where they tend to have certain softness to them that you don’t see in television today.

I showed screen-caps from Gossip Girl, Veep, Skins (UK), Shameless (US), 30 Rock, Boys over Flowers, Coffee Prince, The Real Housewives of New York and Pretty Wild (1 photo) respectively.

Gossip girl, Boys over Flowers, Skins (the first generation and a few episodes of the first season of the second generation) and Coffee Prince are my strongest examples of this phenomenon. Unlike most shows I’ve put here, they maintains that soft, hazy yet raw look in the entirety of their show (However I do think gossip girl starts to lose it slightly in season 4 and upwards).

Weirdly, the softness of Gossip Girl and Boys over Flowers reminds me of a David Lynch movie, specifically Mulholland Drive and Blue Velvet.

Veep’s look stays that way only for its first season. To me that suggests that the show looked that way possibly against their will, maybe due to low budget costs, because in season 2 and upwards it looks completely different from that. 
Veep’s look is slightly different from gossip girl and the rest, because it has a lower contrast making it look a bit hazy and less raw, however it still has that warmth other shows I’ve listed do.

I think 30 Rock only fits this description for earlier seasons…maybe season 1 and 2. Season following this still have the soft appearance I’ve described, but it has way higher saturation which I find a bit distasteful…

Shameless’ look is also a bit different from the 
others, probably the one that looks the ‘rawest’ to me. Unlike gossip girl, the show doesn’t constantly maintain a warm look. There are scenes where you see cooler tones, specifically in episodes that take place during colder seasons. However on gossip girl, the show constantly looks that way no matter the weather.

I’ve noticed this look is also a bit prevalent in reality tv of the 2010s. Although I haven’t watched the ones I’ve listed - Real housewives of New York & Pretty Wild - I’m drawn to watching them now because I’ve noticed this pattern on them.

I know nothing about videography, but this has been ringing in my head for a while now and I’m curious as to what made them look this way. Were they stylistic choices, were they even intentional? Is it even colour grading or is it the camera that makes it look this way? 

I never see tv shows look this way anymore so I’m also wondering what made people stop making them look this way…it’s very nice in my opinion. Of course it may not look the best for certain genres but for the shows I’ve listed it definitely worked perfectly for them.

I know this might be oddly specific, but if anyone has noticed this pattern at all please reply or share your thoughts! ",1,1737315951.0,videography,1,1.0,False

For the life of me I can't seem to find someone who likes me. I'm 19 male in college so I know I'm young, but I haven't even had a silly highschool fling, and I honestly just want a relationship. (I'm attracted to women btw forgot to mention)

Anyway here's a crap ton of oinformation about me over analyze:

Physically:
19 Male
6'2""
Skinny, yet have muscles. (No abs but who really has those.) (I'm stronger than I look, people have said)
I shoot archery which isn't that physical of a sport but still requires focus and certain muscle training.
I attend a weekly yoga club.
I have danced in stage plays before.
I work out almost everyday, whole body, with focus on shoulders, arms, and back (archery muscles) and cardio.
Also I have good hands eye coordination.
I carry myself high, if im in a rush, then I'll carry myself in a rush. But unless is pouring rain all day and slush is everywhere outside I never mope around feeling sorry for myself.

Appearance:
Straight Brown hair with brown eyes.
Hair is nearly cut, although sometimes gets grown out. (Used to be bleached at the tips, might to that again, cuz I like the look).
Clean shaven face.
Long eyelashes, thick eyebrows,(I don't think these matters but everybody says that about me).
Nice teeth (people say as well, my grandfather's a dentist so I guess it makes sense).

Intellect:
Currently attending college for my dream career.
Speak fluent English and a little of Spanish and ASL.
Mainly book smarts and a college level understanding of most topics.
Special interest in paleontology and animals (so I know alot of random information about that and the environment).
However I can be ditsy at times, I've noticed.

Personality:
A little bit nerdy, (I like Nintendo games).
One of the weird devil spawn introverted extroverts, who gets more active around people I'm comfortable with.
fun goofy attitude, i get unserous when I want to and when the time is right.
But when I'm upset or tired I get very serious and don't mess around.
I know who I am and I'm comfortable with myself.
I get excited about things I really like, and will give things I don't like a few tries before giving up.
Often take charge within the friend group, as I'm the biggest so I have to talk to the people at the store and ask the questions (everyone in my friend group is very introverted).
I'm respectful to everyone.
I have a great group of friends in real life and online.
Hate smoking and drugs and alcohol.
I really do love myself, and I know who I am, but it gets really lonely sometimes.
Confident in myself, but I do get nervous sometimes like everyone else on the planet.

Skills:
Acting/voice acting (have stared in many shows during college and highschool).
Sports/physical activity.
Building.
Cooking. 
Writing.
Drawing. 
Anything hands on really.
Worked retail so I know people skills.

Ok probably forgetting stuff but that's me in a reddit post.

Anyway whenever I meet a new girl I'm very upfront about who I am, and I'll tell them most of this information if we meet in person. I don't try and pretend to be cool and slick. But none of them seem to stay.

The last date I went on, was pretty good I thoughy, we got coffee and chatted for about 2 hours. But then she lost interest and I just stopped texting and never heard back. She then made an Instagram post today about how she matched with someone on a dating site, so now I know how she feels about me.

Same with this terrible girl I went out with for a little (never dated because I realized how crazy she was). I just saw her with some new fling, but she's really not a good person.
So how do they keep getting guys to like them??? Same with those sleazy gym bros, I just don't get it.

I never do anything I'm not supposed to when meeting a girl. I ask her questions about herself and actively listen to what she's saying. And answer honestly when she asks.

I have a type, but I don't specifically only date girls like that. I don't believe in people being in sperate leagues either, if I find a girl pretty and nice I'll ask her out. If it's a no, so be it.

I've never had a second date so I have no experience with taking someone out to an activity like Ice skating or something. Because I like taking the first date slow and just getting to know someone better.

I meet girls in person or online, It really just depends how it happens. I don't use dating apps, but if I end up talking to one one social media and if the conversation goes well. I'll ask them if they want to meet in person to get to know each other better, and for a formal introduction.

I guess it's overall just bad luck. But it's getting really frustrating. 
Probably just the biology talking, but I want to care for someone.
Am I doing something wrong when meeting women? And I not showing them how great I am, or am I being too boring by just wanting to take it slow.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks for reading all this by the way. It's super long but I needed to rant.

She was extraordinarily beautiful - a Turkish woman who received constant attention from modeling agencies and admirers on social media. Having never dated before, I was struck by what seemed like clear signs of interest, including an incident where her bag got stuck in my car during orientation, leading to her encouraging me to ask her out.

She was upfront about wanting to become more religious in her Muslim faith. I repeatedly sought assurance that our different religious backgrounds wouldn't be an issue, and she consistently reassured me. We both shared that we were inexperienced in relationships.

she was a virgin as well with no romantic history. It seemed so perfect. On our second date she climbs on top of me. I push her off and tell her that I don't want to have sex. then the next time we come over She initiates again and I am less hesistant this time, but I still say it's a bad idea. I had told her these things were hard for me because of childhood SA. she keeps on saying that she wants to do this, and she promises me that she won't regret it after about 4 times I say okay. It doesn't work mechanically. and a couple of days later she says she we should slow down and I tell her I agree. Then the next time she comes over I take her away from my apartment. she says she wants to come over to my apartment after this. Then she initiates again. I say no once, but I relent more quickly. It works this time. Then during aftercare we say we saw each other forever. The next week she cancels on me everyday. except for one where she asks me to meet her friends. Note that she does work on Friday-Sunday. The next week she cancels on me again on Monday. I tell her that I am not happy with the way she has been treating me. and then she tells me that she has never felt the way she feels for me before and that she feels everytime she gets close to me she has to push me away. I am sympathetic. I tell her I am willing to do whatever it takes, but not texting me for a day at a time makes me feel bad. The next time she comes over. She says she wants to go to a coffee shop near my house because she felt guilty about sex. instead of having my house, but when we get to parking garage she says she wants to go to my room. Then we start cuddling and then she initiates sex again. I said let's slow down then she says the guilt will go away with time. I tell her I don't want to do this because I don't want to lose her. She promises me I won't lose her. and then we do it again. Then I go on vacation and she starts pulling away again, and when I get back doesn't text me for two days when I ask to hangout, then gets super defensive and lies to me when I call her out on it. The next time we see eachother I tell her I love her for the first time and she breaks up with me. saying that she has been crying at night, feels like allah is punishing her, and that she doesn't see it working out because of her religion. She also told me she almost dropped out of school and failed all her classes and that she was in a bad place. She acknowledged that she treated me badly. I wished her the best.

Then she asks me to read the Quran, and tells me she misses me twice. I ask to speak to her and don't say anything smart and got desperate. She said she felt so guilty she wanted to wear hijab. and it was completely over within a week after that when I spoke to her the next week. We haven't seen eachother since.

This all happened over two months.

I see her dancing with one of her male friends one week later, and she had pictures of herself with revealing clothing within two weeks after that.

I didn't really have time to process this. This was all during one of the most important times in my career. I was preparing for exams, and I was barely holding on, but everything worked out. I avoid her at work, but the one time I do see her she starts tearing up. When everything calmed down, I wrote her a love letter and tell her I promise I will never contact her if she texts me the word no. and she texts me asks me how I am doing and then blocks me immediately without giving me a chance to respond and then when I confront her over it over email, she lies to me makes up a story and calls me toxic. We argue. I wish her the best, and acknowledge my mistakes as well.

\-Self-Reflection

There were things I liked about her outside of her appearance. She insisted on paying for herself on dates, she didn't ever use her appearance for personal gain. she had an interesting family background, her father was a blacklisted professor from her home country and was a former professional soccer player as well, but I realize the main thing that I liked was the validation I received from getting an extremely hot girl to give me her virginity. Now I am a pretty attractive guy, pretty much everyone I meet comments on my appearance, but I'm not have modeling agencies comment on my instagram posts that they want to sign me.

I have been struggling with it. I have some time now, and want to get back into dating before I go to medical school, but during the study period and dealing with the heartbreak I put on some weight. I have options, but my issue is that I subconciously compare everyone I meet to her. When I see a hot girl online or in person I compare them to her and honestly none of my prospects compare to her in raw physical beauty. Which sends me into a spiral of looking at her social media and reliving our last argument.

The thing is that I don't think that I want to get back with her. When I saw her text me before I realized she blocked me I was conflicted about whether I really even wanted to deal with it, but the sense of security I got from having her want me so much at that time that I don't know if I'll ever get back there.

1i572n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1i572n0/review_of_virgin_voyages_jan_2025_notes_for/,Review of Virgin Voyages Jan 2025 + notes for embarkation and central sea terrace bid (couple in late 20s-early 30s),"Completed the Eastern Caribbean Antilles cruise on the Scarlet Lady in January 2025 out of Port Miami. This review is about the experience in the Scarlet Lady, not the ports for Eastern Caribbean Antilles.

This is my favorite cruise line at this point. Virgin Voyages always makes me feel very well taken care of and the value is pretty good if you book far ahead to get a discount or included bar tab, so we (me (30F) and my husband (29M)) will be doing another VV cruise in 2026.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Summary (9.3/10):** very well organized, clean, kind crew members, food is great with large variety, lots of events during ship time, good free wifi (premium required for streaming), pool is small, fitness facilities are great



**Embarkation and Debarkation (9/10):** Embarkation was pretty smooth, we had a 3:30 pm embarkation time and got there early unexpectedly (traffic lightened) at 2:30 pm. We thought we would have to wait, but the 2:45 pm group was already starting to board and we got on by 3:15 pm (*so show up an hour early and people will probably already be lining up for your group*). 

Debarkation was by 10:30 am and you can walk off with your luggage or leave it out by 10 pm the night before. Debarkation was also pretty smooth, HOWEVER - getting an uber or lyft might be difficult if you leave when everyone else leaves around 10 am, so leaving a bit earlier (maybe 9 am or 9:30 am) might be better.



**Service (11/10) :** This is my second voyage on the Virgin Voyages and I will be doing a 3rd cruise with them in 2026. The staff are all so kind and it feels a lot more relaxed chatting with them than a typical cruise line. They remember you from the night before if you frequent the same restaurant or bar and I like to tip them a bit at the end of the cruise (you can give cash if you like, not required but a little bit is still nice to give). Our stateroom attendants (we had 2) were so sweet and really attentive to our needs.



**Food and Dining (9/10):** I never felt rushed when at dinner and always encouraged to get dessert or more if I wanted. I really like that you can try different specialty restaurants as included in your cruise fare, it can be difficult to get a reservation if you don’t book as soon as the app opens, but you can always go to sailor services in the beginning and see if they have any times that work for you.  My favorite restaurant is either the Wake or the Galley, but their Pizza Place is a casual made-to-order pizza that has *my favorite* ricotta pizza. The really popular restaurants like the Wake can take some time to serve your entree, but that restaurant is packed around dinner so you might need to be more patient, but the wait staff is  doing their best to give you a good experience. The Galley also provides dinners if you don’t have a reservation or want a more relaxed dinner experience like butter chicken, greek lamb shank, and beef Wellington, you just won’t know the menu until that night. I really enjoyed getting breakfast at the galley because each station had something different: panini breakfast sandwiches, eggs Florentine, pancakes, omelettes, muesli or overnight oats were all offered for breakfast before 11 am. Cruise food can also feel a bit repetitive,  but I feel like that's a cruise thing and there are still a large variety of options.

The Wake and Extra Virgin were close to completely booked for dinner once we finally stepped on the cruise, so make sure to book those first in the VV app.

\*If you get a bar tab, you can use that on non-alcoholic drinks too like juices and coffee (I get a latte each morning)



**Stateroom (10/10):** We bid $200 on the central sea terrace and were awarded the room 2 days before our cruise (we probably could have bid $180 and got it as well). Me and my husband have a bit of motion sickness so we got the Central Sea Terrace and felt very little rocking during sea days, maybe a bit of shaking but nothing that made us feel at all nauseous. One note is that I think the Rockstar Suites are at the front of the ship, so we decided not to bid on those because we worried about motion sickness. Our stateroom was always very clean, the bed was comfy, and the room is controlled by an iPad for the lights and tv.

  
**Age Range (not a rating thing lol):** By eye, maybe like 20-30% in the 30s and below age range and the rest were older. Most people were super kind and chatty, but of course, some people will always find a way to be less kind to the crew (an older gentleman (50s-60s) was yelling at a young crew member at the Social Club and saying she looked like a child about a candy that he wanted, but thankfully the management came over. It's literally just candy), but most people were friendly.



**Entertainment (6/10):** The shows are meh for me, we had a really great comedy magician duo, but I wasn’t as into the other shows. We saw Ships in the Night and Dual Reality - very pretty to look at in terms of the dancing and gymnastics but I feel like there isn’t much of a plot to either show. However, the trivia is really fun and it’s fun to watch the different events the happening cast puts on (you can just watch if you don’t feel like participating). I think there are a lot of events you can go to like bingo with the diva, karaoke, or beauty classes, you just have to find a way to fit it in to your schedule and get out of your stateroom. But if you feel like staying in the stateroom, there are plenty of on-demand free movies and the free ship wi-fi is fine for using google, using iMessage or WhatsApp, or any social media apps. And if you get the premium ship wifi for a day, it works really well for streaming. If you do get the premium wi-fi however, it is only assigned to the one person who clicked on it for that day or for the cruise duration, but you can share if if you switch logins.



**Fitness (9/10):** And if you’re at all into fitness, the gym is awesome: one side has a bunch of new and clean treadmills, stationary bikes and a cycling class room (with all fitness classes included in your cruise fare). The other side of the gym is a weight room with dumbbells up to 50-60 lbs I believe and most machines you would find in a complete gym including a smith machine for doing squats or chest exercises. I subtracted a point because the classes are a bit more beginner/intermediate fitness level so if you're more advanced, you might be better off doing your own workout routine. I recommend trying a class you're interested in at least one time and see if you like the instructor's method of teaching. Also, ask that instructor when they teach that class during the voyage because instructors can switch time slots.



**Pool (5/10):** The only thing I don't like about VV is I wish the pool area was more exciting or bigger, but not many people seemed interested in the pool as much so I’m ok accepting that as a caveat (we did an excursion that involved waterfall jumping in the Dominican Republic so that was our adrenaline hit for the vacation). There are 4 normal sized jacuzzis and I think a pool near the galley that is like a jacuzzi on Decks 15 and 16, but all VV pools are more for relaxing than anything.

  
We really loved the service, the convenience, and the cleanliness of the ship and facilities, so we will be back on the Scarlet Lady in Europe next year.

1i572br,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i572br,Momo Tea is open for business,"


This was my second kit and way more than I anticipated after the Rolife Coffee Shop. I appreciate all the words of encouragement from folks on here, and especially the YouTube link. The directions were unclear at times and the images in the instructions not great, so being able to see the real pieces definitely helped fill in some gaps!

I made a few missteps along the way, but learned a lot from building this one. 

Gorilla Glue’s gel glue was perfect for the stairs. It holds immediately on contact and dries super quick. The downside is that you have to have steady hands–there aren’t really any redos. The glue was incredible for both the steps and window panes… less so for some of the other details. 

I used a mix of Gorilla Glue, craft glue, and glue sticks. I should have been more patient with some of the components and opted for something other than the Gorilla Glue. There are a few spots with noticeable residue. 

I made a few minor adjustments. I lost the sheet of silver paper after making the mirror and improved with aluminum foil for the espresso machine. And I didn’t love the gold paper in the cabinet so I swapped it out for a small piece of a picture of a mural to cover the part label. I’m debating adding the stair railing. Since it’s paper, I’m worried it’ll be quite fragile and might be better without rather than risking damage. And I LOVED the little couch (which is supposed to be downstairs) so I swapped with the bench to put it on display. 

Overall it was really fun and took about a week and a half to build. While the Rolife coffee shop feels like the sum is greater than its parts, with the Cutebee tea house, I think the overall product isn’t quite as cute as some of its components. ",27,1737315865.0,miniatures,1,1.0,False

1i5710m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i5710m,"COMC! 150 board games, 100+ of which are solo-able ☝️","Games! Games everywhere! I’m not even sure if I found all of my hiding spots. Luckily I have a very tolerant and understanding wife. 

Hi there - frequent contributor to the community here and I wanted to do a rare r/soloboardgaming COMC. I play mostly solo and have amassed a sizable collection that I love very much . 

Quick about me: I grew up on video games but at some point along the way they started to not leave me satisfied. I still crave playing them but it just doesn’t hit the same way as it did when I was a kid. There are some exceptions to that, but for the most part I’ve mostly moved on. Lucky for me, board games scratch that exact itch. As I said, I’m mostly a solo player - first off, none of my family members are as excited about board games as I am. Second, I spend most of my social energy on my kids, wife and work, so it’s very therapeutic for me to sit by myself with some coffee in the morning and play an hour or three of a solo board game. It’s so therapeutic that I do it almost every single day before the rest of the house wakes up. Because of that, I have a large collection that gets a *lot* of playtime put into it.

Anyways, this isn’t my life story, I just wanted to provide some context. I track my plays on BG Stats, so I can report that I play roughly 1/3 of my collection each month. I’m currently sitting at 153 games (not including expansions). Roughly 10% of it is “junk” like What Do You Meme, Apples to Apples and the like. I keep the junk for when the kids have friends over that want to play them. Outside of those, I look at the rest of my collection pretty frequently. If a game hasn’t been played in a year, I usually will get rid of it. I’m pretty quick to cull in general at this stage of my board gaming career - if I don’t like a game, or if I feel like I got what I needed out of it, off it goes. There are some exceptions to that rule… Dead Cells probably won’t get a bunch of play time, but I love owning a physical representation of one of the few video games that has truly captured me as an adult. 

Some random thoughts:

** My favorite games of all time: ** Marvel Champions has been there since the beginning and will always be my true love. I can’t get bored of it. The full collection isn’t visible on the shelves, but it’s there and it has its own special storage system. I had Arkham Horror first and wanted it to be my favorite, but it feels just a bit too much like a chore to play. Marvel Champions is so easy to get to the table and slam a round out, has really fun deck building options that have only gotten more fun to me as more content has released, plus I’m a bit of a comic book nerd so it satisfies that. Final Girl is another all time favorite. It takes the horror slot that I wanted Arkham Horror to fill. As I’ve played more and more games I’ve come to realize that it’s really not that great mechanically, but man-oh-man does it nail the theme. It does such a great job of creating a campy horror movie story that I forgive it for it’s flaws. I think I could move on from this game and not miss it all that much to be honest, but it was one of my first favorite games and I enjoy it enough still that I will probably back every season that they release until the end of time. 

**What I’m a Sucker For:** Upgraded components. I’m not a collector and I play my games, so I feel qualified to go against the grain here. I know that a bunch of extra nonsense add-ons and stuff like that gets a bad wrap in the gaming community, but I just love it. This is one of the few things in my life that I spend a bunch of money on so I really allow myself to lean into what I want to enjoy. A bunch of extra goodies falls into that bucket so I embrace it. I obviously want there to be a good game there as well, but give me the metal coins, the upgraded tokens, etc. 

**Getting new games:** This is a high that hasn’t worn off even a little bit: experiencing a new game is so much fun. I love unboxing a game, punching tokens, reading the rule book, exploring what it has to offer, etc. I assumed at some point that feeling would wear off, but I’ve been consistently doing this for several years now and I still get the same excitement of digging into a new game. 

**Spreadsheets:** Most games go into BG Stats, but if a game is really special like Marvel Champions, it gets a spreadsheet. It’s my own little checklist and I love using them. Usually I reserve this for games where I want to beat every villain with every hero, but I’ll do it for any game that I know I’m going to play dozens of times. 

**Games I’m excited About Right Now:** The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick-Taking Game just arrived and I’ve been enjoying the every loving crap out of it. It is super thematic, great art and loosely follows the book. It has a solo mode that works very well and I’m exciting to try to drag my family into playing it. I couldn’t hook them on the Crew, but I’m thinking I can get them to enjoy this. I have a birthday coming up and I’m willing to leverage that to guilt them into playing with me if needed. I’m also learning Cloudspire. It’s an absolute beast, but what I’ve played and learned so far is incredibly intriguing. It kind of goes into my love of upgraded components, but Chip Theory Games have been really speaking to me as I’ve dug into Too Many Bones and now this. 

**Up Next:** There are three publishers/designers that I really want to dig into more: Uwe Rosenberg, Garphill, and Chip Theory. I have a loose long term goal that I want to play every solo-able game that each has to offer. Ignoring what I’ve already played, I’m going to do it roughly in release order (just picked up Agricola so that’s next after Cloudspire). I plan on trying out the stinkers too, just to say I did. As I said before, playing new games is exciting to me so I don’t mind bouncing off of some them that I don’t enjoy. This will take years obviously, and there are plenty of other games outside of those three that I want to play, but it’ll be a list sitting there for when I’m in the mood to treat myself to a new game and I don’t have anything immediate that I have to get my hands on. I also have a pretty good log of crowdfunded games that I’m excited to have arrive this year. At the top of the excitement list: Earthborne Rangers, Leviathan Wilds, Deep Regrets.

**Non-Solo:** My son and I play the ever loving crap out of Dice Throne and Unmatched. He’s 10 and loves PvP games. My wife and teenage daughter love Cascadia, Carcassonne, and Sky Team. The four of us really enjoyed Hogwarts Battle and we’re slowly playing though Invincible: The Hero Building Game now. Pandemic Legacy Season 1 was a huge hit with my wife. She’s not a huge gamer and doesn’t have a very high tolerance for medium and heavyweight games, but that one really grabbed her. 

That’s it. Happy to answer any questions if there are any. This is a great community and one of the very few social media corners of the internet that I partake in. Happy gaming. ",14,1737315770.0,soloboardgaming,1,0.89,False

Second picture is a drawer bottom and references the same 78670. I’m pretty certain the W is width and the L is Length. Other drawer bottoms in the kitchen have the same 78670 with different “Cab” numbers, along with the sub text under that being different. Seems like the builder or sub contractor laid out the kitchen then marked the parts accordingly for easier assembly. 

I’m mostly wondering what the 78670 means.

I have been using them both, but the Lingo is showing higher highs and not always close to the prick. The graph above was recorded on my Lingo after a piece of banana bread and coffee with cream / sugar (experimenting). The lingo reached 175, but the highest my finger prick recorded was 150 at 45 mins. The prick also lowered to 130 10 mins after the 150 reading. During my lingo spike, it was showing my glucose at 188. Later, it reduced the spike to 175 like the 188 never happened.

Has anyone had experience with the Lingo overestimating glucose spikes?

Has anyone noticed that the numbers often change on the Lingo after the spike declines?

Additionally, if we do wish to use the heater, we would have to wait for 30 minutes to allow the heating to take place. We figured it was a waste of time and just dealt with it. Back then it was gruelling because we’d sometimes shower in 3-5 degrees. Now, I take my cold showers with ease as I got very used to it.

Literally eats nothing but canned meat and the cheapest bundle of spoiling spinach off the wet market. Doesn't socialize with friends nor date.

Only 'buddy' he has is a 7 Eleven employee who sells him knockoff cigarettes.

**The current timeline is 2031. There's an ongoing war on Europe** and biochem companies are pumping out drugs and research at ginormous scale. This is what I kinda plan he gets on, but I'm just not sure how he gets into it in the first place exactly. Mind you, he becomes a millionaire! Though, I guess inflation would have made that a slightly nearer goal post.

(As far back as 2023, he was foreseeing a WW3 event and by 2028, the ""Continental War"" is officially started with NATO declaring war on Iran. Lots of bombings and damages would take place and lots of treatments for survivors would then be developed. So, he starts buying stocks before the war? At what point in the war would the stock price in these fields begin to grow?)

As a side note, there's also this black market of surplus military drugs just ending up all over the world, but that shouldn't directly be one of courier MCs ventures.

In terms of taste, the espresso convinced me again! The Robusta provides a thick crema and clean extraction, but surprisingly does not drown out the fine acidity of the Arabica. I would actually place it in the orange or perhaps peach (?) range. It loosens up the chocolaty base note and the fat body of the blend and enlivens it. A nice blend of classic espresso with a little modern twist.

I told my husband I can’t handle it anymore and he talked to her about only staying until the end of January due to me needing a break and she packed her bags and abruptly left hours before her work shift.

Newbie here! Sorry if this is redundant but the basics FAQ didn’t quite help. This is my first espresso machine and for the past couple of weeks I’ve had it, I’ve had pretty much no consistency with the end result 🤣 

I’m weighing fresh beans with a scale - 18g. Grinder set on 2 if you’re familiar with this brand, there’s about 1-3 setting that is set for espresso. Pulling anywhere from 32-36g of liquid. I don’t measure the liquid each time…

My grounds overfill the portafilter pretty heavily so I assume I’m losing about 1g at a time and basket seems VERY full no matter how much I whisk, tap, and tamp, which I try not to do too aggressively. 

Sometimes (never consistently) it’s the best pull of my life - better than any coffee house I’ve been to. Other times it’s extremely sour or very bitter and strong. I’ve recently switched the beans hoping this would help and today it was extra bitter. I’m using medium roast.

Does anyone have any knowledge regarding this grinder and its actual best setting? I am looking to tweak my set up and get a different grinder down the road but I’m trying to make this one work for now. 

Is 18g really necessary? Seems like I could get a better pull with less 🤔 help! TIA! ",0,1737315202.0,espresso,5,0.5,False

1i56o9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1i56o9p/the_power_went_out_in_my_apartment_complex_im_the/,The Power Went Out in My Apartment Complex. I’m the Only One Who Didn’t Leave.,"I’m not really the adventurous type. I’ve always been more of a homebody, someone who’s perfectly content staying in, cooking something simple, and watching reruns of shows I’ve already seen a hundred times. My apartment isn’t much to look at, but it suits me. It’s a little rundown, sure, but there’s a kind of charm to it: narrow hallways, flickering overhead lights, and those thin walls where you can hear every muffled conversation or late-night TV show your neighbors are watching.

I’m not exactly buddy-buddy with my neighbors, but I know them in that distant, city-living way. There’s the single mom, whose kid likes to stomp around, the retired couple in 3B who sit by the lobby window every morning, and the guy across the hall who blasts music way too late at night. It’s predictable, even comforting in its own way. I like knowing the building isn’t completely silent.

My routine is pretty simple. I work from home, cook for myself, and scroll through social media when I feel like I need to pretend I’m still connected to other people. It’s not the most exciting life, but it’s mine, and I’ve never felt the need for more. The background noise of the building, the hum of activity, faint voices, footsteps in the hallway, reminds me I’m not completely alone, even if I keep to myself most of the time.

That’s why I noticed right away when things started feeling... off.

It started a couple of nights ago. I was lying on the couch, scrolling through my phone like usual. I wasn’t paying much attention to anything in particular- just the endless doomscrolling we all do when we’re too tired to sleep but not tired enough to do anything productive. Then the lights flickered.

It wasn’t unusual for the power to hiccup in this old building. It’s happened a dozen times before, usually during a storm or when someone’s messing with the breaker panel in the basement. But this time was different. This time, the lights didn’t come back on.

I sat there for a second, waiting for everything to reset, but the apartment stayed dark. I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight, shining it around the room. My first thought was that maybe it was just my unit, so I got up to check the breaker box. But when I looked out my window, the entire street was blacked out.

The whole building was silent. No footsteps, no voices, no faint hum of TVs or music. Just this heavy, oppressive quiet that made my skin crawl. I told myself it was nothing, that it was probably just a temporary outage like before. But for some reason, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

You’d think a power outage in an apartment complex would cause some kind of commotion, people talking in the halls, fumbling for flashlights, maybe complaining loudly about the inconvenience. But there was nothing. No murmurs, no doors creaking open, no footsteps. Just this oppressive, heavy silence that felt like it was pressing down on me.

I shone my flashlight down the hallway, expecting to see someone poking their head out, but the entire floor was empty. That’s when I started to feel uneasy. It wasn’t just the lack of noise, it was the way the silence felt alive, like it was waiting for something.

I went to the window at the end of the hall and looked out. The entire block was blacked out. Streetlights, buildings, even the distant glow of the city- everything was gone. But here’s the thing that didn’t make sense: a few apartments in my building still had faint lights on. Not normal lights, more like a soft glow, almost like candlelight, but colder somehow.

I decided to knock on a few doors, just to see if anyone else was around. I started with my neighbor across the hall. Nothing. No sound, no shuffling, no muffled “Who’s there?” Just dead silence. I tried the woman’s door, the single mom. Still nothing.

It was around then that the unease started creeping into panic.

I went back to my apartment and grabbed my phone to text a friend. That’s when I noticed I had no signal. No Wi-Fi, no data, nothing. I couldn’t even get a text to send. I told myself it was just because of the power outage, but the isolation was starting to get to me.

After a while, I went back to the window to check the street. And that’s when I saw them- people leaving the building. At least, I think they were people.

They weren’t running or shouting, like you’d expect during an emergency. They were moving fast, but eerily quiet. Some of them were dragging suitcases; others just clutched bags or backpacks like they’d left in a hurry. They didn’t stop to talk to each other. No one even looked back at the building.

I watched them disappear into the darkness, one by one, until the street was empty again.

I thought about leaving too, but... where would I go? The entire neighborhood was blacked out, and the idea of stepping into that darkness, with no clue where I was going, felt worse than staying put.

I locked my door, sat on the couch, and told myself I’d just wait until morning. But even then, I couldn’t shake the feeling that staying might’ve been the worst decision I could’ve made.

\-

The hours dragged on, and the silence in the building started to mess with my head. I don’t mean the kind of quiet where you can still hear the occasional hum of the city outside, sirens in the distance, cars passing, people talking. I mean real silence. Heavy. Unnatural.

I kept telling myself it was normal during a blackout, but it wasn’t. Even in the dead of night, there’s always some kind of noise. But now? Nothing. It was like the entire world had just... stopped.

At first, I tried to distract myself, scrolling through my phone even though I had no signal, pacing the room, anything to keep my mind occupied. But then the noises started.

It was subtle at first: faint tapping sounds, like someone lightly drumming their fingers against a wall. I ignored it, thinking it was just the old building settling, or the barely maintained pipes, but it didn’t stop. The tapping moved, shifting from one side of the apartment to another, as if it was circling me.

Then there was the creaking. It came from above, like someone was walking around on the floor above mine. Except... I’m on the top floor.

I grabbed my flashlight and opened my door to check the hallway. It was empty, just like before. I stood there for a while, listening, but the air felt off, thicker somehow, like it was pressing in on me. I shut the door and locked it, trying to push the unease down.

But the worst sound came later. I was lying on the couch, trying to convince myself I was overreacting, when I heard it: the faint sound of a child giggling.

It was soft, barely there, but it made my skin crawl. It didn’t make sense. There were no kids in this building, at least none that young. And it wasn’t just the sound, it was the way it echoed, like it wasn’t coming from the hall but from everywhere.

I grabbed my laptop. The building’s security cameras still worked, even though the power was out, so I thought maybe I’d catch something on the footage.

At first, everything looked normal, just empty hallways and the lobby. But the longer I watched, the more I noticed something was... wrong.

The movements of the people leaving earlier? They weren’t smooth. They were jerky, like old film footage missing frames. And then there were the shadows. I didn’t notice them at first, but in a few frames, I saw faint figures standing in the corners of the hallways, completely motionless. Their faces were blurred or obscured, like the camera couldn’t quite focus on them.

I sat there, staring at the screen, trying to rationalize what I was seeing. Maybe it was a glitch. Or maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me. But the longer I stared, the more certain I was that something wasn’t right.

And then came the knocking.

It was faint, barely more than a tap, but it sent my heart racing. I froze, listening as it grew louder, more deliberate. I grabbed my flashlight and crept to the door, every step making the air feel heavier.

“Hello?” I called out, my voice shaking. The knocking stopped.

I peered through the peephole, half-expecting to see one of my neighbors finally breaking the silence. But there was no one there. The hallway was empty.

Except... it didn’t feel empty.

The shadows in the corners looked darker, longer. The air outside felt different, heavier, like it was waiting for something. I backed away from the door and locked every bolt, every chain, and then I sat down in the corner of my apartment with my flashlight clutched in my hand.

I told myself it was all in my head, but deep down, I knew something was wrong. 

By the time daylight rolled around, I was barely holding it together. Every noise, every shadow, every second of silence felt like it was pressing down on me. I thought maybe if I saw the building in the daylight, it would snap me back to reality, make me realize this was all just in my head.

With my flashlight in hand and my phone (still useless) stuffed in my pocket, I decided to explore the building. Daylight streaming through the windows made me feel a little braver, like I wasn’t completely alone.

I started knocking on doors again, hoping someone, anyone, would answer this time. Most of the apartments were completely silent, but a few... they weren’t empty. Not in the way I expected.

The first one I walked into was unsettling, but not in an obvious way. It looked normal at first glance: a couch, a coffee table, a stack of magazines. But then I noticed the plate of food sitting on the table, half-eaten, like someone had just stepped out for a moment. The TV remote was on the couch, angled like it had fallen from someone’s hand.

The next apartment was worse. The faucet in the bathroom was running, and the sink was nearly overflowing. There was a mug of coffee on the kitchen counter, steam still curling up from it, but the air in the room was ice cold, like no one had been there for hours.

It was like everyone had just... disappeared.

By the time I made it to the lobby, I was shaking. I hadn’t seen a single person, not even through a window. But that wasn’t the worst part.

The message board.

It was covered in notes, hastily written scraps of paper, some in handwriting I recognized from my neighbors. “Leave now. It’s coming.” “Don’t stay.” “Get out before dark.” Over and over, the same desperate warnings.

I stood there staring at the notes for what felt like forever, my mind racing. Who wrote them? When? And why hadn’t I noticed them before?

Despite everything, I started to feel a weird sense of relief. The building itself looked fine, untouched by whatever nightmare I thought I’d been living through. The sunlight streaming through the lobby windows almost felt reassuring, like the world outside was still normal.

I decided it was time to leave. Enough was enough. I grabbed my backpack from my apartment, threw in a few essentials, and headed straight for the front doors.

For the first time in hours, I felt like I was making the right choice. I was getting out of here, leaving this nightmare behind.

But when I pushed the doors open, the relief vanished in an instant.  
  
Instead of stepping out onto the street, I found myself staring at the back wall of the lobby.

I blinked, frozen in place, trying to make sense of it. I turned around, expecting to see the doors behind me, but I was back in the lobby. Exactly where I’d started.

I tried again, running this time. But no matter how fast I moved or how hard I pushed, I couldn’t get outside. Every exit led me back to the same spot- the middle of the lobby, staring at that message board with its endless warnings.

The light from the windows didn’t feel reassuring anymore. It felt... wrong. Artificial, like it was part of the trap.

And I realized: I wasn’t going anywhere. This building wasn’t going to let me leave.

I think that’s when I finally lost it, when I realized there was no way out.

I tried every door. Every single one. The fire escape? It led me right back to the hallway, like the stairs had twisted around on themselves. The basement? I ended up standing in the same lobby I’d just left, staring at that damn message board. I even tried the windows, but they wouldn’t budge. It was like they weren’t real, just painted-on illusions meant to keep me trapped.

And then the building started... changing.

The hallways stretched longer than they should have, twisting into impossible angles. The staircases looped endlessly, taking me in circles no matter how far I climbed or how fast I ran. One door opened into a room I’d never seen before, someone else’s apartment, pristine and untouched, with sunlight streaming through the windows. For a second, I thought I’d finally found an exit. But when I stepped inside, I ended up back in my apartment, the door slamming shut behind me.

The noises didn’t help. They were everywhere now.

The whispers started first, low, indistinct voices muttering just out of earshot. Then came the footsteps, slow and deliberate, echoing from somewhere above or below. I couldn’t tell. At one point, I heard laughter. It wasn’t loud or obvious, just this faint, airy giggle that made my stomach twist.

And then I saw it.

I was standing at the end of the hallway, catching my breath, when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. A figure. Tall, dark, and completely still, standing at the far end of the corridor. I froze, my flashlight trembling in my hand.

It didn’t move. It didn’t even seem to breathe. But I swear it was looking at me.

I blinked, and it was gone.

That’s when I bolted back to my apartment. I locked the door, shoved the couch against it, and piled every piece of furniture I could find in front of it. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might give out. I told myself I’d wait it out until morning, but deep down, I knew that wasn’t going to help.

The tapping started again. Louder this time.

At first, I thought it was coming from the door. But then I realized it was all around me, behind the walls, under the floorboards, above the ceiling. It surrounded me, closing in.

I grabbed my flashlight and turned in circles, trying to pinpoint where the sound was coming from. And that’s when the light started flickering.

For just a moment, the beam hit the wall, and I saw them.

Faces. Dozens of them, pressed against the plaster, their features distorted like they were trying to push through. Their eyes were empty, their mouths moving silently, forming words I couldn’t hear.

The flashlight cut out, plunging the room into darkness. I backed into a corner, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps, and all I could think was: I’m not alone in here.

The tapping escalated into pounding, shaking the walls so hard I thought they were going to cave in. The floor beneath me felt unstable, like it was tilting, pulling me downward. It wasn’t just the building anymore, it felt like the whole room was alive, trying to swallow me whole.

The air was freezing now, so cold that my breath came out in visible puffs, even though I knew that made no sense. My ears were ringing, my hands shaking, but I needed to do something.

I grabbed my laptop, hoping, praying, that maybe the security cameras would show me something I could use to make sense of this nightmare.

When I opened the feed, my stomach dropped.

The hallways were no longer empty. They were filled with shadowy figures, standing perfectly still. There had to be dozens of them, all facing my door. The camera quality wasn’t great, but even through the grainy footage, I could tell there was something wrong with them. Their shapes didn’t look... human.

My hands hovered over the keyboard as I tried to convince myself it was a glitch, some weird reflection or artifact. But then the figures moved.

Not naturally. Not like a person would. They moved frame by frame, jerky and unnatural, each step bringing them closer to the camera.

The pounding on the walls stopped abruptly.

I froze, staring at the screen, waiting for something to happen. My apartment was dead silent now. No whispers, no footsteps, no creaking floorboards, just a suffocating stillness that made my skin crawl.

That’s when I noticed the shadows on the feed. They weren’t just moving- they were converging. Slowly, deliberately, they turned toward the camera, as if they knew I was watching.

I slammed the laptop shut, my heart racing.

I stood there, trembling, and turned toward the door. I don’t know why- I think part of me hoped I’d see something normal outside. Maybe someone had come to help, or maybe I was imagining all of it.

I peered through the peephole.

All I saw was darkness.

It wasn’t just the hallway lights being out, it was wrong. The kind of darkness that doesn’t feel empty, that presses against you like it’s waiting to consume you.

And then, I felt it.

A breath on the back of my neck.

I spun around, clutching my flashlight, but before I could even turn it on, I heard the whisper.

“You stayed. Now you’re one of us.”

It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t even threatening. It was calm, almost welcoming, which somehow made it so much worse.

The light flickered back on for a brief moment, and I swear, just for a second, I saw them. Faces- blurry and distorted, standing all around me. Watching. Waiting.

And then everything went dark again.

\-

When the power came back on, it was like nothing had happened. The lights stopped flickering, the hum of the refrigerator kicked back in, and the apartment felt... normal.

I sat in the middle of my living room, surrounded by overturned furniture and the mess I’d made while barricading myself in. The silence wasn’t heavy anymore. It felt lighter, almost peaceful, like the building was trying to convince me that everything was fine.

And for a while, I let myself believe it.

Over the next few days, things settled down. I started putting my apartment back together, trying to convince myself that it had been some kind of stress-induced hallucination or a nightmare I hadn’t fully woken up from. But I couldn't settle. I packed up and drove away, the roads feeling like a ghost town until I hit civilisation again. People. Seeing real people made my heart skip.

I checked into a motel, and settled in, hoping to regain some sense of normalcy.

But then the little things started.

The first time I noticed it was in the mirror. I was brushing my teeth, staring at my reflection like usual. But when I turned to grab a towel, I could’ve sworn my reflection stayed still for a fraction of a second longer than it should have. It was subtle, so subtle I convinced myself I imagined it.

But it kept happening.

Sometimes I’d hear myself muttering under my breath, only to realize I hadn’t said anything. Other times, when I walked through the apartment, I felt this strange heaviness in the air, like someone was standing just behind me. Watching.

And then the note came.

It was slipped under my door, sealed in an envelope with no return address. At first, I thought it might’ve been a mistake, junk mail or a neighbor’s letter delivered to the wrong place. But when I opened it, my stomach dropped.

The handwriting was mine.

“It’s not the building. It’s you. You brought it with you.”

I tore through the apartment, searching for any explanation, anything that could make sense of what was happening. When I got to my suitcase, the one I’d unpacked weeks ago, I found something I didn’t recognize.

A key.

It was old and tarnished, the kind of metal that feels unnaturally cold when you touch it. And I knew, deep in my gut, exactly what it was: the key to my old apartment.

I didn’t pack it. I don’t know how it got there.

That night, the tapping started again. Soft at first, but it grew louder, more insistent, like it was demanding my attention.

The key sat on my nightstand, vibrating faintly. I grabbed it and threw it out the window in a panic, desperate to get it away from me.

But when I turned back to my bed, the key was there again, sitting in the exact same spot.

I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t even think straight. I looked out the window, and saw the other motel guests looking wary. They had started getting the same symtoms I had. I could tell by the way they were looking around for something that seemingly wasn't there.

I didn't have a clue on how to get rid of it. But if the note was true, and I truly had brought it with me, the only thing I knew for sure was that I couldn’t stay there anymore.

It wasn’t going to let me go.

So, I did the only thing I could think of. I went back.

The drive to my old apartment complex was a blur. The key was clutched in my hand the entire time, cold and heavy, like it was pulling me back.

When I got there, the building looked exactly the same. Dark. Quiet. Empty. The lights flickered as I stepped inside, just like they had before.

The message board in the lobby was still there, covered in those desperate notes. But this time, there was a new one. It was written in my handwriting:

“Welcome back.”

The air grew colder as I climbed the stairs, my footsteps echoing down the empty halls. I could feel something watching me, the weight of unseen eyes pressing down on me with every step.

When I reached my old apartment, the door was already open.

Inside, everything was exactly as I’d left it- except for the walls.

Black smudges were spreading across the plaster, twisting and branching out like veins. They pulsed faintly, as though something was alive beneath them.

And then I heard it.

A voice from the shadows, calm and welcoming.

“Welcome back. We’ve been waiting.”

I shouldn’t have gone back. I know that. But I didn’t have a choice. I couldn't bring this to more of the population, and the building... it never really let me leave.

It wasn’t just the building, though. It was me.

Thus, what examples do elders give by their life to us Christians who live in a very complicated world today? And what can and must we contrast with the troubles that come crashing down on us like an avalanche?

***""Pray Always""***

**We laypeople like stories about miracles very much, and about grace-filled gifts, but we forget somewhat about the price we have to pay for these things. Your book opens with a conversation about the holy elder Joseph the Hesychast. Tell us a little bit about the labors that he and his community performed, and about what lesson we laypeople can derive from this—without, of course, dreaming of duplicating it all.**

Elder Joseph the Hesychast lived on Mt. Athos, though I did not manage to meet him while he was alive, as he reposed in 1959. But I did get to meet all his disciples.

My *starets*—Elder Joseph from Vatopedi Monastery—was a disciple, the first disciple of Elder Joseph the Hesychast, and so my monastic life began under the influence of his spiritual school.

Elder Joseph was one of the most outstanding spiritual figures on Mt. Athos in the twentieth century. He was a great ascetic, but also a notable hesychast.^(1) His life was full of miracles and the activity of God and the Most Holy Mother of God. In spite of the fact that he was a hermit—that is, he did not go out anywhere—four of his disciples subsequently became the spiritual fathers of hundreds of monks.

Right now there are approximately a thousand of us—monks who came from Elder Joseph the Hesychast. Out of the twenty monasteries on Mt. Athos, six of them were revived by spiritual children of Elder Joseph. We consider that his prayers and his presence greatly influenced our monastic life.

We inherited three important things from Elder Joseph the Hesychast and his disciples: the first consists in the value of obedience—to the Church and to one's elder. The second, in taking part in the Divine Liturgy, in the Eucharist, that is, in regular Communion. And the third is the practice of mental prayer.

Our whole monastic life was and is dedicated to these three important things. Elder Joseph the Hesychast was occupied in unceasing mental prayer for six hours every evening.

He would spend eight hours at night serving the all-night vigil. Six hours were dedicated to mental prayer and spiritual reading, and two hours to the Divine Liturgy, which was celebrated daily. This all began at sunset. On Athos, if eight hours pass after sunset, it is already sunrise—especially in the summer.

And after sunrise the fathers would rest a little, then, after a small breakfast—a cup of coffee or some kind of dried bread—they would work very hard in order to survive. In the afternoon they would have dinner, and after that they would lie down to sleep. An hour before sunset they would get up and once again perform Vespers by prayer-rope, have a cup of tea or eat some kind of fruit, and after sunset the all-night vigil would begin, which would last eight hours.

His disciples lived by such a rule, and for some time we also lived like that.

Today it is a great blessing that Elder Joseph's teaching has spread over the whole Orthodox world. But even Western Christians and people of other religions are interested in the elder and translate his few works into their own languages.

**Today laypeople are so busy that in the morning when they get into the car they turn on tapes of the morning rule, and glory to God, that they manage to do even this. What should laypeople do—contemporary people who are busy at their work but who should nevertheless pray and come to church?**

Prayer is the unceasing remembrance of God. God’s presence ought to be unceasing in our life. If we learn to say the Jesus Prayer, this little prayer: “Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me,” if we fill all our time with addressing God, if we do the Jesus Prayer at all times—when we are taking a shower, eating, or when we are in the car (instead of listening to the radio), or when we’re in the subway, on a bus, or in church, that will be more than enough. The remembrance of God must accompany all the things that we do in our life.

**In your book, when you are telling the story about Elder Porphyrios, you cite this episode: A woman called him on the telephone, after he had already died on Mt. Athos. He answered her: “Don’t call me any more—I’m dead.” What did he do that for, when she could find this out by ordinary means?**

*(Laughs)* Yes, when she asked, “May I call you again, Elder?” he answered her, “You don’t need to call me any more—I’m dead” *(Laughs)*. And the same thing happened to a nun on Cyprus. She heard about this occurrence, and, as she had very close ties with Elder Porphyrios, she started to get curious, and she decided to call him on the phone, wondering if he would answer her or not. He answered her, “Dear, what are you doing—experiments here?” and hung up the phone.

[Elder Paisios and the young Fr. Athanasios    ](https://preview.redd.it/h8iuln6y10ee1.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=d03ff1416054220e49505e1846053fbe63cd3755)

**Elder Paisios was your teacher. Two stories: when Fr. Paisios was on Mt. Sinai, at St. Catherine’s Monastery, they sent an** ***imam*** **there—and as is well known, there is a mosque on the territory of St. Catherine’s Monastery. The father superior wanted to complain, but Fr. Paisios said, “Wait, wait, we’ll say a prayer right now…” They prayed, and the imam went away and never showed up there again. The second case—when they were supposed to show the film** ***The Last Temptation of Christ*** **in Greece, and the elder blessed people to fight this, to protest. Where is the line here—when should we try to influence what is going on around us by prayer, and when must we express our position?**

Holy people such as Elder Paisios did not behave themselves in life simply by going by some sort of rule. Even in little life situations, before undertaking anything, they first prayed, received a notification from God, and behaved accordingly.

Elder Paisios never went out into the public, but in this case he went, in order to participate in this protest together with all of the people. I am sure that he did this after prayer, after having prayed.

Even when some visitor would come to him, he would pray first, and only then would he open the door to him: that is, first he received notification from God whether to open the door to this visitor or not.

Once I even asked him, “Elder, but they’re knocking at the door—let’s open it!” And the Elder answered that he didn’t have any directive from God to open the door to this person.

That is, even in such simple things he had to receive notice from God. And all the more so, when this had to do with more serious situations. Therefore, we cannot establish any rules as to how we should behave in this or that case by some story, because the saints in each case prayed to God before acting.

We shouldn’t think that if some protest is organized, that we must by all means participate in it, because Elder Paisios participated in one.

Likewise, we shouldn’t say that we won’t go, because Elder Paisios didn’t go. We have to have discernment and discern God’s will in each separate case.

**In your book you also tell about St. Arsenios of Cappadocia, and there are such penetrating words there: “He overcame the torment of the saints.” And, telling about Elder Joseph, you talk about how he endured eight years of the cruelest demonic warfare. “Give blood and receive the Spirit.” What does “Give blood” mean for a contemporary Christian? How can he put this into practice?**

When Elder Paisios returned from Australia—he had gone there at the invitation of an Australian archbishop—I asked him what kind of people lived in Australia. How do they struggle, how are they saved, and do they love God?

The Elder answered that he had met great people in Australia, because there people are saved through pain, through humility, patience and prayer.

I think that this relates to all people who live in the contemporary world. Pain is present in every person’s life—in our personal life, in the life of our family, in the life of our country, in the whole world, in all of society.

Wherever you look, everywhere there is pain, war, death, and problems. It’s enough to listen to one news bulletin and your heart is already filled with pain.

Now we have the ability to get information from the whole world. And we must pray and display endurance in this whole situation.

That is the way that will lead us into the Kingdom of Heaven. Not for nothing did the Lord Jesus Christ say to us: “In your patient endurance save your souls.”^(2) He did not tell us that it was through fasting or prayer—He said that it was through patient endurance. Patient endurance is the fruit of faith, and it is nourished by prayer. And all this happens within the Church.

**“*****No one can cause harm to John except John himself”***

**Since we have already begun to speak about patient endurance, I will ask you about the family—a good number of pages are dedicated to it in your book. Here, a great many people are only first-generation church-goers, and they do not have the experience of a Christian family—their mothers, fathers, and grandfathers. Where can they learn about the Christian understanding of the family?**

The Christian life is not complicated and not hard. The Christian life is simple. The Lord did not teach us things that are hard to put into practice. We have to fulfil God’s commandments with simplicity, live with the Sacraments of the Church, teach our children God’s Word and not worry, not get upset about what tomorrow will bring.

The Lord told us that, first of all, we must seek the Kingdom of God, and He will give us everything else.

Let’s take the first Christians—they didn’t even have a Gospel that they could read, because it hadn’t yet been written. But Christ was for them their Guide and Teacher.

We people on Cyprus were in slavery for 800 years—about 400 under the Franks and 400 years under the Turks. They didn’t allow Greeks to get an education—all Greeks were uneducated. Priests learned the Divine Liturgy by heart. My grandmother didn’t even know how to write her name. Nevertheless, in the course of 800 years the people preserved the Orthodox Faith, and preserved their families, because they lived within the Church.

And in the course of 70 years what preserved Russia? Absolutely, the Divine Liturgy preserved Russia and the whole world. And this little leaven was enough for all of Russia.

**In your book it tells the following story: a son complains about his father, that he drinks and is going out with another woman. And they tell him, “Look at this from another point of view. He is suffering and therefore he is acting like this.” How can we learn to put up with our close ones who, in our opinion, are behaving badly in some way?**

One day a young man came to Elder Paisios and said, “Elder, my relatives, my brother and sister—no one understands me. I am suffering a great deal because of this.” The Elder answered him, “My dear! If they do not understand you, then you try to understand them! First, understand right away that they are not able to understand you—what do you want them to understand you for, when they aren’t able to understand you? Understand that their weaknesses, their problems keep them as it were to themselves. Look at them with understanding and love. Don’t expect anything from people, so as not to suffer. Better to expect something from God.”

Then this person thought: “If I understand them, then I won’t suffer from the fact that they don’t understand me.” I also say this to people who complain about similar things. “My husband doesn’t understand me.” At that I tell her, “Understand him, and then your problem will be solved.” It seems to me that this works.

**Vladyka, you often talk about the upbringing of children. There is this problem: often children at 12, 13, or 14 years of age go out of church or don’t want to come to the services. What do you advise parents to do in such situations?**

If a parent concerns himself over his child’s upbringing from the moment of his conception—that is, when the child is still an embryo, because contemporary elders say that the upbringing of children begins even before they are born, even before they are conceived—if even then we begin bringing them up, then before they are 12 we can do a great deal.

And when a child gets to be 12, 13 or 14 and he reaches adolescence and is going to “rebel” and “revolt,” then outwardly, doubtless, we will not be able to do much—but perhaps this isn’t even necessary, because we have already done everything before this. And in this case we must simply pray very hard.

[Elder Porphyrios the Kapsokalivite](https://preview.redd.it/djzcql2120ee1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=e798660dd501b61434fbeba8c3c262118194b3db)

St. Elder Porphyrios told one woman who was complaining to him that she talked to her son about God, but he didn’t listen, “Don’t worry. Just change the way you act. Talk to God about your child, instead, and God will want to listen to you. Then the Lord Himself will have a talk with your child.”

The Lord doesn’t worry, the way we start to worry. And He doesn’t panic. He doesn’t have any situations where He doesn’t know what to do. The Lord leaves a person his freedom, then He embraces him and leads him back to Himself.

Once a young man who had disavowed everything came to Elder Paisios. He said to the Elder, “I have done everything possible and have left God.” The Elder embraced him, kissed him, and said, “Here you have run and run and run and have run right to the doors that lead to God.”

**In one of your conversations you say that we have to show respect for each person, for his faith and culture, without detriment to his faith or culture. How was it possible to realize this under the conditions, for example, when Cyprus was enslaved for 800 years?**

Undoubtedly, those who enslave other people do not respect them. However, they can enslave our body, they can destroy our house, they can kill all the people around us, but they cannot take our soul.

One great saint of the times of the Turkish domination in Greece, St. Cosmas of Aetolia, used to say to the enslaved Greeks, “If the Turks want your money, give it to them. If they need your houses, give them your houses. If they want your cattle or your fields, give them all of this. Give them everything that they want. Only do not give them your soul.”

Do not give anyone your soul. People can enslave everything they please, except our souls. Only sin can enslave our soul. The holy fathers feared sin, but not any kind of outward event. But even sin cannot enslave us if we do not consent to it. There is a story about St. John Chrysostom, who rebuked and reproved Empress Eudoxia. She was very angry and wanted to send him into exile. She was a very bad person. Then the Patriarch’s deacons and subdeacons came to him and said, “The Empress is looking for you, in order to send you into exile somewhere. She wants to cause you harm.” St. John Chrysostom began to laugh and answered, “Don’t fear—no one can cause me harm, except me, myself. No one can cause harm to John except John himself.”

**“*****The Body and Blood of Christ unites the Church”***



Metropolitan Athanasios of Limasol The Church’s Open Heart / Translated from the modern Greek by A. Volgina and A. Saminskaya. Moscow. Sretensky Monastery Press, 2014. 320 pages, illustrated.**In your book there is a chapter dedicated to the goal of the Church and of our Christian life. Many of us come to church with requests: Lord, help my son to enter the Institute; help me to recover my health… This is all very important, too, but what is the goal of our Christian life?**



The goal of the Christian life is Christ. Christ is not simply some kind of idea, He is not a philosophy, Christ is not Someone Who is far away in heaven. Christ is the greatest experience that a person can have in his life. He is the greatest reality of all the realities of life. The ancient Greeks used to say, “There is nothing new under the sun.” One great saint replied, “There is nothing new under the sun, except Jesus Christ.” He is our goal. Vigil, prayer, fasting, chastity, virginity—all this we do in order to attain one goal: Christ.

**Vladyka, here in Russia people love Elder Paisios very much, as you probably know. Very, very much. Why do you think it is him in particular?**

*(Smiles.)* The Lord gave him the gift even during his lifetime of loving people, of loving people very much and of praying for all people, for the whole world.

It is my personal opinion, but when I saw him praying in church, then I thought: if there is some person who holds the helm of the whole world, it isn’t the president of America (then Russia was not as strong), it isn’t a communist, it isn’t any person of this world—it’s Elder Paisios. He is able to steer the rudder of the whole world. I don’t know how this goes in Russian, but in Greek in the troparion dedicated to St. Anthony, we sing: “He supported the whole inhabited earth by his prayers.”^(3)

And I believe that Elder Paisios had this gift from God—to support the whole world by his prayers.

Everybody knows about Elder Paisios today, although he was a simple, humble man somewhere in the forests of the Holy Mountain, illiterate, who avoided people: if he saw a gathering of people he would avoid it. How did the world find out about him? On Cyprus sometimes I visit schools and talk with the pupils. They may not know about Christ or the Mother of God, but if I say “Fr. Paisios” everyone understands.

**Vladyka, today much separates people, including politics. How can we remember that we are all Christians of the various Local Churches—one Body of Christ?**

Orthodox Christians, we are all the Body of Christ, because we perform one and the same Divine Liturgy and communicate of the Body and Blood of the Lord. At every Divine Liturgy the whole Orthodox Church is present—all the patriarchs, archbishops, metropolitans, bishops—the whole world. We are all the Body of Christ.

I arrived in Russia and communed of the Holy Sacrament^(4) of Christ. I didn’t understand anything during the Divine Liturgy, because I don’t know Russian. Only (*he says in Russian)* “Gospodi, pomiluy”^(5) and “Axios,” too—I heard that yesterday, but this isn’t important. What is important is that it is the one and the same Body and Blood of Christ. And you, when you travel to Greece, will not understand anything during the Divine Liturgy, perhaps, but you can receive Communion. The same thing applies to our Orthodox brethren, the Arabs in Syria, and our brethren in Africa, and in the whole world. The Body and Blood of Christ unites the Church. We love all people, whoever they may be. But our brothers according to the spirit are members of the Orthodox Church. Our brothers according to the flesh are the whole world; but according to the spirit, only Orthodox Christians.

Alright, so I lost my brother 1.5 years ago in June to terminal cancer, he was 20. I don’t think I have complex grief as I’ve accepted he’s gone. While my consciousness accepted that he was gone, I guess my unconscious wasn’t so ready, as on his birthday in October I went to his grave with his/my friends and some voice in the back of my mind said, “wow, he’s really gone. You’ll never be able to drink with him in a bar, this is how you will spend his birthdays until you die, you won’t have nieces or nephews that are blood related to you, your inheritance has literally doubled” all these other things. 


I thought before this that I was doing alright on trying to be happy and live my life as I’ve felt better since the first few months after his passing. I realized that I actually haven’t really been all that happy for a bit. I remember when he was going through chemo when I was in undergrad and I was a mess. I was passing my classes with As and Bs, but I was barely putting in effort and procrastinating doing things last minute. I went to a coffee shop and started studying German for the first time since my brother started chemo. I kept coasting in my German class because I was the best at grammar (my professor and a few classmates told me this) and was able to guess meanings of words reliably enough, but I used to actually study and I did better. I started to get a tingly feeling in my brain and I realized I was starting to get happy that I was being a good student; my mind quickly made me think about my brother and what he was going through, almost not letting me be truly happy. I also have severe ADHD so I’m already naturally starved of dopamine, so this has been a struggle. I realized that I’ve been doing this almost every time since his diagnosis and now death. Whenever I start to actually get sort of happy, I’m reminded of him. I almost feel like the narrator in “Notes From Underground” by Fyodor Dostoevsky. He says something like he’s fully aware that he’s in the “Underground,” but feels like he belongs there even though he knows he is able to climb out of it.

Ciao a tutti!  So, my Italian adventure is over, and I'm already dreaming of my return.  It was an incredible trip, filled with moments I’ll cherish forever.  But beyond the stunning photos and delicious food (which, let’s be honest, were plentiful!), I came away with some valuable takeaways that go beyond just ticking off bucket list items.

**The Charm of the Unexpected:**

Italy, for me, wasn't just about the iconic landmarks. While the Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa were breathtaking, it was the unexpected moments that truly stole my heart.  A spontaneous gelato break in a sun-drenched piazza, chatting with a friendly local in a tiny village, stumbling upon a hidden trattoria serving the best pasta I've ever tasted – these are the memories that truly define the trip.  My advice?  Embrace the unplanned. Get lost in the charming backstreets, deviate from your itinerary, and allow yourself to be surprised.

**Slow Down and Savor:**

Italy operates on a different rhythm.  There's a slower pace of life, a greater emphasis on enjoying the present moment.  This was a welcome change from my usually hectic schedule.  I learned to appreciate the simple pleasures: a leisurely breakfast, an afternoon spent people-watching, the evening ritual of aperitivo.  Taking my time allowed me to truly absorb the beauty and culture of the country.  This is a lesson I'm eager to carry back into my daily life.

**The Power of Connection:**

Despite the language barrier (my Italian is, shall we say, *in progress*), I found connecting with Italians remarkably easy.  Their warmth, generosity, and passion for their culture were infectious.  Even simple interactions, like ordering a coffee or asking for directions, were opportunities for connection and cultural exchange. Remember, a smile and a genuine effort to communicate go a long way.

**Food is More Than Just Fuel:**

Italian food isn't just delicious; it's an experience.  Each region boasts its unique culinary traditions, from the fresh seafood of Sicily to the hearty pasta dishes of Bologna.  It's a celebration of fresh, seasonal ingredients, prepared with love and passion.  Beyond simply eating, I learned about the history, culture, and traditions woven into each dish.  It's a culinary journey within a journey!

**Embrace the ""Dolce Vita"":**

The phrase ""dolce vita"" – the sweet life – perfectly encapsulates the Italian spirit.  It’s about embracing life's simple pleasures, appreciating beauty, and fostering strong relationships.  It's a philosophy I hope to incorporate more fully into my own life back home.

Italy wasn't just a vacation; it was a transformative experience.  It's a country that nourishes the soul, sparks the imagination, and leaves an imprint on the heart.  If you're planning your own Italian adventure, go with an open mind, embrace the unexpected, and savor every moment.  You won't regret it.  Arrivederci!

I'm 5'2"" and my heaviest weight was 285 a year or two ago. Which is a BMI of over 50. It's insane. All the other women I'm biologically related to are my height and they all weigh like 100 lbs. It's mind blowing to me how little they eat. I treated myself like crap for 10 or 15 years because my mental health was shit and I didn't care about my life. I didn't think I had a future. I coped by abusing edibles and binge eating.

I tried a couple times to lose weight but it never really got off the ground. I didn't bother with fad diets or anything because I know that stuff doesn't work. I didn't try any surgeries or weight loss medication because I can't afford it. I know that exercise and calories in/calories out is the way to go. I never pretended otherwise. My mental health was just so bad that I didn't care to really try. It never helped that I didn't have the best living situations. I ate takeout all the time. I would guzzle down sugary foods all the time.

I'm finally in a good, permanent living situation. I can cook in my own kitchen. My boyfriend and I don't eat out anymore. Maybe like once a month. I've been buying groceries regularly. I'm spending a lot on groceries since food prices are only going up, but it's still cheaper than eating out.

I quit drinking all carbonated drinks a year ago. Coffee (no sugar, only cream), water, and ice tea (unsweetened or zero sugar) are my drinks. I rarely drink alcohol. When I cook, it's a lot of salads, chicken, eggs, baked vegetables and potatoes, ground beef or pork dishes, and sandwiches. I'll still cook the occasional mac n cheese, pizza, or pasta, but I have gone easier on carbs and sugar lately. For snacks, we love cheese, yogurt, hummus, salsa, and fruit.

Diabetes runs rampant in my dad's family. I've had numbness/tingling in my hands in the past few years. Since I've cut out so much sugar, I can actually feel it now when my blood sugar goes too high or too low. I guess I was on such a sugar high 24/7 that I never noticed the difference.

I still have some sweets around the house. My boyfriend is obsessed with chocolate. Right now we have pop tarts, granola bars, and chocolate. I wanted to completely cut out sugar. But I've figured out lately that if I don't eat enough and don't have any sugar, my vision and my brain get so foggy. 

This post is longer than I planned. I just wanted to say that I have lost 25 lbs so far. Getting close to 30. I want to lose at least 100 lbs. I should exercise more. But I'm on my feet all day and they hurt a lot. I want to lose more weight first because I don't want to do more damage to my feet and joints. It was getting more and more difficult to move around. Having asthma doesn't help. But I do feel less bloated lately.

If I lose 100 lbs, my reward for myself is getting a tattoo that I've always wanted.

I’m a 27-year-old guy, and I’ve been getting to know a 24-year-old girl I matched with on a dating app about a month and a half ago. She’s still in college and lives in a hostel about 8 km away from where I live. We’ve both talked about wanting a long-term relationship and turning it into something meaningful, but we’re not officially in a relationship yet.

For some context, I haven’t dated in the last 7 years, so I’m a bit out of touch with how things work these days. Over the past month, we’ve met 4 times and have been in constant touch through calls. She’s not much into texting, so we mostly connect over the phone.

Since she doesn’t have her own mode of transportation, I always pick her up and drop her off at her hostel whenever we meet. Her hostel is on the outskirts of the city, so we need to travel back into the city for food or to hang out.

In these 4 dates, I’ve spent around ₹3,000 on food and outings. She hasn’t offered to split the bill or asked if she could contribute. I hesitated to bring it up because she’s not working yet, but at the same time, it feels one-sided.

What confuses me is that she often goes out with her friends for food or coffee, so she does have some budget for outings. She also sends me Instagram reels that hint at men providing gifts, surprises, etc. I haven’t given her any gifts so far, but I’m starting to feel like she might have certain expectations.

I genuinely like spending time with her and enjoy our connection, but I’m not sure if I’m overthinking this or if I should be concerned. I also don’t want to strain myself financially or set an expectation that I’ll always cover all expenses.

Is this normal when you’re just getting to know someone? How should I bring this up without sounding rude or awkward? Or is it a red flag, and should I step back before things go further?

TLDR: I’m M27 and getting to know a 24-year-old college student. I’ve spent ₹3,000 over 4 dates as she hasn’t offered to split or contribute. She often goes out with friends, so affordability doesn’t seem like an issue. She also shares reels hinting men should give gifts.

My biggest stressor is this couch. My fiance wants it, its a great quality, electric and everywhere reclines so understandably so it’s great. My only problem is how do we make this a new style living room? 

For context in the picture, that is the only configuration the couch can be. It’s a long skinny living room so it’s a big L shaped couch with a window & tv to the left of it. And a sliding glass door to the right behind the couch. 

I am open to painting, rugs, decor, coffee table, shelves, frames, light fixtures, plants.

The couch & the floors must remain the same though. I enjoy color, we’re in our mid twenties so we want our home to be youthful and stylish! Midcentury, gothic, traditional, industrial have all caught my eye but I just have no clue where to even start. The couch feels like it doesn’t match with anything.

The Aiden Coffee Machine:
This machine is fantastic—super sleek and functional. It has made my mornings so much smoother, and everything about it screams quality. I got the Big Aiden Bundle for under $300, which feels like a steal. The only downside is that it doesn’t have a drip stopper, so every time I remove the pot, I end up with some coffee drippings on the base. It’s a minor inconvenience, but it’s something to keep in mind. Otherwise, this machine is top-notch, and I highly recommend it.

The Ode 2 Grinder:
I have mixed feelings about the grinder. Given that it’s $100–$200 more expensive than the Aiden, I expected better performance. The first unit I received jammed multiple times within the first month, and I had to get it replaced. So far, the replacement unit is working fine, but it’s still quite loud, and I occasionally worry about it jamming again during certain grind settings. For the price, I hoped for a smoother experience.

The Bundle Deal:
The Big Aiden Bundle is an excellent value for what it includes. Despite the minor frustrations with the grinder and the drip stopper issue, I’m still very happy with my purchase. It’s a stylish, efficient addition to my kitchen, and the coffee quality is amazing.

If you’re considering this bundle, I’d say go for it! Just keep the potential grinder issues and drip situation in mind. All in all, it’s been a solid upgrade to my coffee game.",0,1737312968.0,pourover,13,0.27,False

1i55t1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LinguaMotion/comments/1i55t1d/why_breakfast_at_the_bar_is_an_italian_tradition/,Why Breakfast at the Bar is an Italian Tradition You’ll Love,"https://preview.redd.it/nmtgnbltxzde1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a033d5e22356912383f768b684ced30d1cd311de

Breakfast in Italy is more than just a meal; it’s a cherished ritual showcasing the Italian way of life, especially at the bar. When you have breakfast at the bar, it’s usually before going to work or during a mid-morning work break. Breakfast might be a quick affair at home—biscuits, coffee, or a packaged brioche are the usual staples. But at the bar, breakfast transforms into a cultural experience—an authentic moment of flavor, tradition, and connection.

# Here’s how it works:

**What Italians order:** The classic combo is a cappuccino (or *cappuccio* as we call it) and a croissant (*cornetto*). If you’re feeling fancy, there’s always a *cornetto alla crema* (with custard) or *alla marmellata* (with jam).

**The atmosphere:** It’s quick and social. Most people stand at the counter, chat with the barista, and leave in under 10 minutes.

**The cost:** It’s surprisingly affordable! A cappuccino and a croissant will cost you around 3 dollars/euros.

**Etiquette:** Sometimes, you may need to pay extra if you sit at a table, so it’s good to check first—it’s for those who want to take their time.

**Why it’s special:** It’s not just about food—it’s about community, routine, and the simple joys of life.

Have you experienced breakfast at an Italian bar? What captured your heart—the flavors, the vibrant atmosphere, or the authentic Italian charm?

I’m a 27-year-old guy, and I’ve been getting to know a 24-year-old girl I matched with on a dating app about a month and a half ago. She’s still in college and lives in a hostel about 8 km away from where I live. We’ve both talked about wanting a long-term relationship and turning it into something meaningful, but we’re not officially in a relationship yet.

For some context, I haven’t dated in the last 7 years, so I’m a bit out of touch with how things work these days. Over the past month, we’ve met 4 times and have been in constant touch through calls. She’s not much into texting, so we mostly connect over the phone.

Since she doesn’t have her own mode of transportation, I always pick her up and drop her off at her hostel whenever we meet. Her hostel is on the outskirts of the city, so we need to travel back into the city for food or to hang out.

In these 4 dates, I’ve spent around ₹3,000 on food and outings. She hasn’t offered to split the bill or asked if she could contribute. I hesitated to bring it up because she’s not working yet, but at the same time, it feels one-sided.

What confuses me is that she often goes out with her friends for food or coffee, so she does have some budget for outings. She also sends me Instagram reels that hint at men providing gifts, surprises, etc. I haven’t given her any gifts so far, but I’m starting to feel like she might have certain expectations.

I genuinely like spending time with her and enjoy our connection, but I’m not sure if I’m overthinking this or if I should be concerned. I also don’t want to strain myself financially or set an expectation that I’ll always cover all expenses.

Is this normal when you’re just getting to know someone? How should I bring this up without sounding rude or awkward? Or is it a red flag, and should I step back before things go further?

TLDR: I’m M27 and getting to know a 24-year-old college student. I’ve spent ₹3,000 over 4 dates as she hasn’t offered to split or contribute. She often goes out with friends, so affordability doesn’t seem like an issue. She also shares reels hinting men should give gifts. Should I address this, or is it a red flag?",1,1737312620.0,AskIndianWomen,18,0.67,False
1i55qoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i55qoi/dad_cheating_on_mom/,Dad cheating on mom??,"So my brother saw that my dad was dming a girl the other day because her message popped up when my dad was showing him something on his phone. It was about meeting her somewhere that afternoon.

So, background on me.  I am tech savvy and know my stuff, and I'm in the market for a new laptop, but I'm planning to customise it for the best specs I can get.  I can do all this online, but what you can't do there is get a feel for what you're buying, so I'm in my local big electronic store checking out different makes.

While browsing, I overhear a woman looking to buy a new laptop for her 13 year old daughter to help with her schoolwork.  She has a budget and the salesman is going through different specs while her bored little girl quietly loiters behind her.

The guy helping her starts going on about how she needs different things and throwing performance figures out all over the place. He's pointlessly upselling her in my opinion, but it's not really my business.

""This one's just a base model, so will struggle with some tasks, but we do have it with an upgraded processor, new out, that will definitely handle what you want"".  I'm thinking ""Well that's bullshit, she's only doing homework""

""The second HDMI port on this model gives it more flexibility"". More flexibility for what?  Plugging it into a second TV so you can see Wikipedia better?

""The better integrated graphics means you can get 120FPS compared to a normal 60FPS which is better for the eyes when sat there for a long time"".  I'm sorry, what?

By the time this sleaze had finished, the poor techphobic woman was looking at a £1200 top of the range laptop, capable of on the going gaming and acting as a mobile media hug.  Frankly I'm surprised the guy didn't try telling her it would keep your coffee warm too.  It was more than the £700 budget she said she had, and more than you need to spend on a 10yr old to help her do her homework.

But that's no big problem.  The guy can set her up on buy now pay later.  And then monthly payments for a years at 19.7% Apr.  It's a steal, he swears.  And with that he goes off to the warehouse to get hew new purchase 

And, well, sod it, let's make it my business.  I can see the lady is unsure, she doesn't know what he's selling her, let alone that he's selling her more than she wants or needs.  And I can see that the money was a bit concerned for her.

""Sorry, excuse me ma'am, I couldn't help but overhear you wanted a new laptop for your daughter?"" I said across the top of the display.

""Oh, I'm ok, I'm being looked after, thanks"" she muttered back with a weak smile.

""Yeah, I heard.  I don't work here, but I wanted to say that I think he's screwing you and you don't need what he's selling you."". She looked puzzled and didn't say anything.

""I'm just browsing myself, but he's selling you a top of the range media laptop.  You said you just wanted it for your daughter for her homework, but with what he's getting you... well, it's massively overkill for what you want.""

Looking over to where the guy went she said ""are you sure?""

""Yes ma'am.  Look, let me show you"" and I went round to her side of the display.  ""I'm assuming you want it for her to look things up online, write her essays, that sort of thing?  I'm guessing you don't want it to plug into your TV and stream movies?  And your not planning to use it to make your own PIXAR films or that she's going to be gaming for hours?""

""No, none of that, just schoolwork"".

""Ok, then yeah, he's trying to rip you off.  I'll show you want you actually need"". And I walked her back down to the mid-tier spec devices.  As I'm showing her the guy comes back, new laptop in hand and I see him stop out the corner of my eye slow up as he approaches.

""Hi, I've got it here, did you want to follow me to the....""

She looked up at him and just went ""Oh no, I'm ok, this young man is just helping me right now"" and turned back to me.

The guy looks me up and down and just goes ""but he doesn't work here, he can't help you""

I just looked at him and said ""it's no worries dude, I've got the time and it seemed like she needed some help so she knows what she's buying""

The guy stuttered and tried to cut in and again asked the lady to go to the checkout, and I just cut him off and said he was good to go as were just browsing and we'll shout him if needed.

The guy walked off quickly and I saw him heading across to the checkouts where there were two managers stood talking.  And I figured my business was going to be shortly unwelcome, so I quickly told the lady to take a photo of the laptop's sales label with the details on it and said I'd write down a shop online where she could buy it for 20% off at the moment as they had a sale on.

As the lady said thank you and turned to leave with her daughter, the guy reappeared with one of those managers and as he came down the aisle I just covered the middle so the lady had a headstart and didn't get collared by the sleaze again, and as I did the manager said ""excuse me sir"".

I just turned and looked at them and, smiling, I said ""oh, we're all good thanks, just browsing, but as I told your colleague, I'll give you a shout if I need anything"" and slipped the earphones that were hanging round my neck back in, took out my phone and hit play.  Not trying to be cool about it, but just being a nuisance as I was still blocking the aisle.

I don't know what laptop the lady ended up getting, and she may have gone back to that store for all I know, but I figured I did my good deed for the year that day.",75,1737312554.0,IDontWorkHereLady,7,0.95,False

1i55kh7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i55kh7,"Update on Sam, the Hot Wheels, and our date. ","A lot of yall wanted an update and I got lots of DMs about it! See down below! TLDR at the end. 

Well, we went on our date! 

I dusted off my other ride in the morning, gave it a wash, then gave myself a wash, stopped at Starbucks for our usual, then headed to her place to pick her up. I got out and went up to her door, coffees in hand, took a breath and knocked on the door. She opened the door and immediately was all smiles, I practiced which coffee was hers so naturally I gave her my cup even though I knew hers was in my left hand, but anyways, after fumbling with that we started walking back to the car and she’s immediately noticed I was not in my daily. I daily a Camry TRD, and my fun car is an Audi S6. She’s questioning me about it, and I’m telling her it’s my other ride that I take out on special occasions. She’s gushing over my car you guys. Noticing all the little things and commenting on things I had done to it. I have this emotional support vehicle sticker on my quarter windows and she was having a laughing fit over it. 

Anyways, we went off, we went across Houston to different Targets, Walmarts, DTs, FDs, Krogers, stopped at an Ulta to buy some hair stuff she wanted, took note of some of the stuff she liked and had picked up and placed down, and I made it point to stop by the colognes under the guise that I might want something to see what she liked since the perfumes are right next to the colognes. Plan on getting her a little basket of stuff for Valentine’s day. Then, around 2 my stomach makes a whale call in the car, we laughed about it and decided on sushi, so I took her to my go to sushi spot. While we’re eating I’m dealing with the whole Overdrive thing, so naturally I word vomit more hot wheels like an idiot, but she was engaged the entire time. We finish up eating, and we go walking to this arcade called Cidercade, arcade and hard ciders. We played games and drank for a couple of hours, the day was gorgeous was decide to go walking downtown some more, its getting kinda of hot for me so I took me hoodie off and she pretty much gasp and it hits me, she’s never seen me without long sleeves. I have a half sleeve tattoo. She grabs my arm and immediately is like oh my god the detailing is great, I love this, and I’m literally blushing and at the same time getting the biggest confidence boost that idk what took over me but I just grabbed her hand and we continued walking. We had been flirting the entire day, the bumping each other, the giggling, the weather, the drinks, it all just felt right. We locked fingers and kept walking, swinging hands, just chit chatting. At this point I just wanted to know more about her felt like I had vomited everything about me, so just kept on asking more about her and learned a lot aside from the superficial stuff I already knew from work. Couple more hours of walking, two ice cream cones, we decided to go back to my place to hang out and listen to some music. We arrived at my place and what’s waiting for me at the door? Big ass box of hot wheels, the sealed set arrived. This day could have not been better. I moved it inside, let her in, show her around, showed her the garage, my bike, more hot wheels, showed her my plants, where I work out, the stray cat that won’t let me adopt him but uses me for food, showed her the neighbor who hates me because the bike is annoying or whatever. We decided to continue to drink and listen to music up until maybe 2am. We danced battled, we played Jenga, made a frozen pizza, burned it, still ate it. 

Come bed time I offered to uber with her back to her place and I would uber back since I didn’t want her to go alone and I wasn’t in any condition to drive or I offered my spare bedroom or my bed if she was comfortable. She elected for my bed. Gave her a t shirt, hoodie, new pair of boxers, some joggers, and we went to bed. We cuddled all night long into the morning. I woke up first in the morning, didn’t want to be a creep and just keep staring at her, she so beautiful btw, anyways, got up, and made coffee and a breakfast scramble with toast, she woke up as I was wrapping up cooking, gave her a toothbrush, momma said you alway gotta have spare toothbrushes at home, we had breakfast, talked a bit more then I drove her home. She kissed me good bye, didn’t slam my door, and when I got home, I went to clean the car, in my passenger door, was a scrunchie. IM OFFICIALLY MARKED LMAO. 

She did text me 30 minutes or so after I dropped her off that she had a great time and thanking me for everything. I told her that she still got me smiling and that I open to hang out again whenever she wants. She hearted my message and said she’s looking forward to the next one. So yeah…. I’m head over boots here. Guys……. I think she IS the one. We’ve known each other for like 2 years now. She was the person who trained me when I got hired, and sadly I quickly got shuffled into another department so we didn’t each other as much but we always would teams each other to go to lunch and what not. About 8 months ago one of directors got let go, shook up the entire tree, moved my boss up and somehow I inherited his role, and then Sam’s department got merged into mine. She was now in my office space so I would make it a point to have candy in my desk and print my documents at the printer closer to her office so that I had a reason to go over there and drop off a jolly rancher or whatever. Not sure why I honestly took this long for us to make it out of the office, but I’m extremely happy it finally

TLDR: Took my date hot wheels shopping with me, we had sushi, went to an arcade, drank, had ice cream, my 2024 factory set arrived, we danced, burned a pizza and ate it, she slept in my boxers in my bed, we cuddled all night, had breakfast, my car has a scrunchie in its door pocket now. ",33,1737312176.0,HotWheels,9,0.93,False

I've made an outline for my new teammates to fit in and make the most impact. Maybe it will hep you too.

This plan isn't just a checklist—it's a roadmap to quickly add value to your new team or help a new team member align with the group's dynamics and goals. In this guide, we’ll break down the onboarding process, provide actionable tips, identify potential pitfalls to avoid, and wrap it up with a playful quiz to test your knowledge.

# TLDR: 30-Day Onboarding Plan for UX Designers

This guide provides a detailed 30-day onboarding plan for UX Designers. It covers essential practices for absorbing company knowledge, setting initial goals, building relationships with the team, and learning the products. You’ll also find ways to practice these steps, common pitfalls to avoid, and tips for making the most of your fresh perspective. A quick quiz and a bit of humor at the end will help reinforce what you've learned.

# 🧽 The Learning Tour

**Goal:** Absorb as much information as possible.

In the first month, your primary objective should be to soak up knowledge like a sponge. Resist the urge to start fixing things immediately. Understanding the systems, the context behind projects, and the people involved is crucial. This approach will help you spot opportunities more effectively and craft logical plans for execution.

**Ways to Practice:**

1. **Shadow Experienced Team Members:** Attend meetings, observe workflows, and take notes on how decisions are made.
2. **Ask for Documentation:** Review any existing documentation on processes, previous projects, and design systems.
3. **Daily Reflections:** Spend 10 minutes each day reflecting on what you've learned and how it connects to your role.

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**

* **Jumping to Conclusions:** Making changes without full context can lead to missteps. Avoid proposing major changes until you’ve thoroughly understood the landscape.
* **Overloading Yourself:** There’s a lot to learn, but don’t burn out trying to master everything in the first week. Pace yourself.

# 🥅 One Month Goals

**Goal:** Establish foundational relationships and understand the basics.

Your first month should focus on building relationships and getting a handle on the products, processes, and expectations.

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Meet and Connect with the Design Team:** Understand their roles, working styles, and how you’ll collaborate.
2. **Learn the Products:** Dive into the key products you'll be working with. What problems do they solve? Who are the users?
3. **Understand Internal Processes:** Familiarize yourself with how the team communicates, collaborates, and delivers work.
4. **Align with Your Manager:** Set clear expectations with your design manager about your role and how success will be measured.

**Ways to Practice:**

1. **One-on-One Meetings:** Schedule time with each team member to introduce yourself and learn about their work.
2. **Product Walkthroughs:** Spend time using the products, identifying user journeys, and noting any immediate observations.
3. **Process Flow Mapping:** Create a visual map of the internal processes you’re learning about—this can help solidify your understanding.

**Avoid:**

* **Superficial Connections:** Don’t just introduce yourself—make an effort to remember names, roles, and how each person fits into the bigger picture.
* **Assuming Similarity:** Just because a process worked at your last job doesn’t mean it’s a fit here. Be open to learning new ways of doing things.

# 👀 Fresh Eyes Advantage

**Goal:** Leverage your outsider perspective.

As a newcomer, you have a unique perspective that others may have lost over time. Use this ""fresh eyes"" advantage to ask questions and gather insights.

**Ways to Practice:**

1. **Ask Questions Daily:** Aim to ask at least five questions each day, whether they seem basic or complex.
2. **Document Observations:** Keep a running list of things that stand out to you—both good and bad. These can be revisited later for potential improvements.

**Try to Avoid:**

* **Criticizing Too Early:** Be cautious about making negative comments before you fully understand the context behind existing decisions.
* **Holding Back:** Don’t shy away from asking questions because you think they’re too basic. Fresh perspectives often lead to valuable insights.

# 🎯 Getting to Know the New Manager

**Goal:** Align on expectations and build a strong working relationship.

One of your first priorities should be getting to know your new manager. Understanding their expectations early on will help you align your work and performance with their standards.

**Key Questions to Ask:**

1. **What Does Success Look Like?** Clarify what is expected of you and how you can exceed those expectations.
2. **Performance Tracking:** How will your work be evaluated? Understanding this will help you track and demonstrate your progress.
3. **Support and Training:** Are there opportunities for additional training or mentorship? Knowing this can help you grow in your role.

**Ways to Practice:**

1. **Weekly Check-ins:** Set up regular meetings with your manager to discuss progress, challenges, and feedback.
2. **Create a Success Plan:** Outline what success looks like based on your manager’s feedback and use it to guide your work.

**Avoid:**

* **Assuming Expectations:** Never assume what your manager wants—always ask and clarify.
* **Overpromising:** Be realistic about what you can deliver, especially in the first month.

# ☕️ Getting to Know the Team (Your New Crew)

**Goal:** Build strong relationships and understand team dynamics.

Your team will be your closest allies, so it’s essential to get to know them well.

**Key Areas to Explore:**

1. **Past Collaborations:** Learn how they’ve worked with product designers before and what they expect from you.
2. **Team Goals:** Understand what they’re working on and what they hope to achieve.
3. **Shared Interests:** Discover common interests outside of work—it helps build camaraderie.

**Ways to Practice:**

1. **Lunches or Coffee Chats:** Informal settings often lead to more open conversations. Use these to learn about your teammates’ work and interests.
2. **Team Introductions:** Offer to present a quick intro about your background and how you’ve tackled past challenges—this builds credibility and opens the door for collaboration.

**Pitfalls:**

* **Staying Isolated:** Don’t wait for others to approach you—take the initiative to introduce yourself.
* **Misunderstanding Roles:** Make sure you understand what each team member does, so you know who to go to for what.

# 📝 Learning the Products

**Goal:** Deepen your understanding of the products you’ll be working on.

Understanding the products inside and out will be crucial to your success.

**Key Questions to Answer:**

1. **Project Kickoff:** How does a project start? Who’s involved?
2. **Design System:** What is the source of truth for designs? How is it used?
3. **Review Processes:** How are designs reviewed? What’s the critique process like?

**Ways to Practice:**

1. **Hands-On Exploration:** Dive into the products as a user. Map out user flows and identify pain points.
2. **Attend Product Demos:** If available, attend demos or walk-throughs to see how the product is presented and used.

**Try to Avoid:**

* **Overlooking the Details:** Ensure you understand both the high-level vision and the nitty-gritty details of the products.
* **Ignoring the User:** Always keep the end-user in mind when learning about the product. Their experience is paramount.

# 🗓 At 30 Days

**Goal:** Reflect and plan your next steps.

By the end of the first month, you should have a good sense of the company, teams, and systems.

**Reflective Questions:**

1. **What Have I Learned?** Summarize key insights from your first month.
2. **Was It Interesting?** Are you excited about the work ahead?
3. **Am I Interested in Learning More?** Identify areas where you want to dive deeper.
4. **What Support Do I Have?** Take stock of the resources and support available to you.

**Try to Avoid:**

* **Not Reflecting:** Don’t skip this step—reflection is crucial for growth.
* **Rushing Ahead:** Ensure you’re fully onboarded before diving into more complex tasks.

# 🚀 After 30 Days

**Goal:** Begin contributing more actively and planning for the future.

Now that you’re more comfortable, it’s time to start making more significant contributions.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Evaluate User Experiences:** How is the experience for new users? What about power users? Is it seamless across devices?
2. **Plan Your First Strategic Project:** Work with your manager to identify a project that will allow you to make a meaningful impact.

**Pitfalls:**

* **Taking on Too Much:** Be mindful of your bandwidth—don’t overwhelm yourself with too many projects at once.
* **Forgetting the Basics:** Continue to refine your understanding of the products, users, and processes as you take on more responsibilities.

# Summary

Your first 30 days as a UX Designer on a new team are crucial for setting the stage for your success. By focusing on learning, building relationships, and understanding the products, you'll position yourself to add value quickly. Remember to take advantage of your fresh perspective, align with your manager, and pace yourself. Avoid common pitfalls like jumping to conclusions, overloading yourself, or making early criticisms. Reflect at the end of your first month, and prepare to contribute meaningfully as you move forward.

Mel Gibson appeared on Joe Rogan and mentioned 3 stage 4 cancer cases among his friends reversing with Fenbendazole/Ivermectin protocol (see link to previous coverage below)

Since the Joe Rogan podcast has viewership that exceeds all TV news channels in US combined, this is being seen as a direct threat to the capture of cancer treatment by traditional medicine practice (which discounts metabolic approach and gears most efforts towards genetic approach to cancer treatment)

For context, here is the Mel Gibson appearance on Joe Rogan:

Mel Gibson on Joe Rogan - reversing stage 4 cancer - it can't get more mainstream than this - when random celebrities have friends who have reversed stage 4 cancer with Fenbendazole/Ivermectin/Mebendazole



&nbsp;


**Rebuttal:**

I raised some questions on the questionable logical arguments in the article in r/ivermectin - which are reproduced below:



&nbsp;


https://www.reddit.com/r/ivermectin/comments/1i4o1gd/comment/m80du13/

Thanks for posting this article. 

The article fails to provide any proof that ""Ivermectin doesn't work"" or couldn't work

Esp for the stage 4 demographic which has few treatments from traditional medicine practices

The rebuttal also fails to address Fenbendazole and focuses mainly on Ivermectin - and tries to create a narrative of why someone might think IVM works (the whole background of the pandemic and IVM)


&nbsp;


I find it interesting how there is a different interpretation of reality in the medical field

If they can justify something cures sometimes (esp if there is a commercial interests - like that recent Alzheimer's drug which most didn't think should be approved but was approved nonetheless) 

Then it is considered ""science"" 

And pushing that treatment is not challenged


&nbsp;


However if a drug has not passed through these stages - may have a public following and lots of anecdotal reports - then it is not considered as an approved treatment

This is valid, in that it is playing by the rules

HOWEVER, what actually happens - that is not science - is that an ""approved"" treatment is called a possible cure 

And the drug that has not been approved yet - is called that ""it is not a cure"" (note the language in the article) 

To be precise, they should say it is not an ""approved treatment"" - that would be fine and it would be accurate

What I find surprising is that the fact checkers/debunkers ALSO go overboard - and say that ""it is not a cure"" or ""it does not work"" 

This is overreach

How do they know it actually doesn't work? 

If to say that something works requires proof 

Then to be accurate, one also needs to provide proof why something doesn't work conclusively

The number of stage 4 cases we are seeing reversing with Fenben/IVM is starting to exceed what one would expect for a rare event of stage 4 reversal

Given the ""potential"" of benefit this suggests, the burden of proof that Fenben/IVM ""doesn't work"" is considerable 

And these fact checkers are unable to provide that proof - that would make the public ignore the growing anecdotal evidence

It is also even more untenable an approach given the traditional treatments for stage 4 are largely ineffective - do not guarantee remission or reversal

In such a context, the burden on Ivermectin should be less, given the traditional treatments are not that effective either (yet fact checkers like to compare Ivermectin effectiveness to a perfect cure) 


&nbsp;


Summary: if the public is convinced of something - then regulators, if they want to debunk that, also need to bear the burden of proof that ""it does not work"" 

Absence of ""it works"" is not the same as ""it does not work"" 

Saying ""it is not an approved treatment"" is more appropriate - BUT when there is panic about loss of revenue then fact checkers and locusts lobbyists can slip up and overreach

Labos: No, ivermectin doesn’t cure cancer, either

By Christopher Labos

January 15, 2025


Mel Gibson claims three friends were cured of Stage 4 cancer by taking ivermectin. Readers would be well served to ignore everything the actor says with regard to medical therapies, writes Dr. Christopher Labos.

Recent events have only reinforced my belief that you should never take health advice from Hollywood actors.

On Joe Rogan’s podcast, actor Mel Gibson announced that three of his friends had Stage 4 cancer and were cured by taking ivermectin.

Readers would be well served to ignore everything he says with regard to medical therapies.

Just as ivermectin failed as a way to prevent and treat COVID-19, it has no role in treating cancer.

Believing celebrities’ medical advice will usually only make you sicker.

Before COVID, most people had probably never heard of ivermectin because it is mainly used to treat parasitic infections. But it is an objectively amazing drug and its impact on global health led to William Campbell and Satoshi Omura receiving a Nobel Prize.

Ivermectin was discovered in 1970 and was initially used to treat parasitic infections in animals and was widely used in veterinary medicine.

However, by the 1980s, researchers found it could also be used in humans to treat onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness.

Though rare in North America, globally onchocerciasis is one of the most important causes of preventable blindness.

Manufacturer Merck ultimately decided to supply ivermectin free of charge to developing countries in an effort to combat the disease.

Excitement over this medication was amplified when it became clear it had a broad spectrum of activity and could treat roundworm parasites like strongyloides, as well as conditions like lice or scabies.

But despite its amazing properties, ivermectin is not magic. It doesn’t treat COVID and it doesn’t treat cancer. Its popularity during the pandemic is both hard and easy to understand.

In the early days of COVID, much research was being produced that was preliminary and non-definitive. One study suggested ivermectin could stop the replication of the virus in a petri dish. There were obvious shortcomings to this paper, namely that viruses and parasites are not the same thing and this was a lab paper, not a study in humans.

Still, the idea took hold with prominent celebrities like Aaron Rodgers and Rogan buying into the hype. Many more studies would come … and then go.

Advocates would point to a 2021 study from Lebanon, but it was retracted when irregularities in the data were discovered. 

Another meta-analysis of ivermectin studies also had to be retracted. This past weekend, the 12th retraction of an ivermectin study was announced.

All these retractions stand against the good quality studies that failed to show ivermectin has any benefit for either hospitalized patients or outpatients with COVID-19.

But it stopped being about science long ago. Ivermectin became a rallying cry for those who opposed vaccinations because contrarianism can only take you so far. 

Opponents of public health measures had to provide some alternative solution and ivermectin fit the bill.

In that respect, it’s probably not surprising it’s now being touted as a cancer cure. When you declare something a miracle drug, there becomes no limit to its uses in your own mind.

But no cancer doctors are giving people ivermectin to cure their disease. Some researchers are looking at combining ivermectin with other chemotherapies to boost their effectiveness, but these are preliminary studies that may very well follow the same trajectory seen during COVID: initial enthusiasm that doesn’t pan out.

I don’t know who Gibson’s friends are or what the truth of their medical history actually is. But ivermectin is not the magical cure he claims it to be.

When we are unconstrained by facts, medications can do anything and treat everything. But in the real world, meds have specific uses. They work in some circumstances and not others.

Ivermectin actually is a wonder drug. It can treat a devastating parasitic infection that can leave you blind. It just won’t cure COVID-19 or metastatic cancer, no matter what celebrities say.

We started trying in my late 40s, and I’m now 50. Unfortunately, we experienced a few miscarriages early on. Initially, I had only undergone a standard sperm test, which gave me an “OK/average” score. Based on this, our consultant at the time assured us there was nothing to worry about, so the doctors focused their investigations on my partner.

It wasn’t until we changed doctors and went to the Lister Hospital in London that I was recommended to take a sperm DNA fragmentation test. To my shock, the results revealed I had a high level of DNA fragmentation, which essentially classified me as infertile.

This news was obviously devastating for both of us. My partner’s gynaecologist then suggested we see an andrologist / urologist, as there could be underlying issues like a varicocele—a common abnormality in the veins of the testicles that can affect semen quality and male fertility. I was initially skeptical, thinking I’d notice if something like that were wrong. However, that turned out not to be the case.

After further testing with the andrologist (Tet Yap, who is brilliant), it was confirmed that I did indeed have a varicocele and also low testosterone levels. The treatment began with a procedure to remove the varicocele, followed by Clomid to boost my testosterone production. The procedure went smoothly, and I responded very well to the Clomid. In fact, my testosterone levels at one point were comparable to those of a teenage boy! They’ve since stabilized at an optimal level.

Three months later, my latest sperm test showed significant improvement—I’m now well within the normal range. It’s such a relief to finally have a bit of positive news after everything we’ve been through so far.

To summarize what I believe worked for me:

1. **Addressing the varicocele and low testosterone** – The varicocele removal and Clomid treatment helped a lot
2. **Adjusting my exercise routine** – I think my previous long-distance running habit may have negatively impacted my testosterone levels and increased heat in the groin area, so I replaced it with weightlifting and jogging.
3. **Lifestyle changes** – I reduced alcohol and caffeine intake, but still allowed myself the occasional treat (a glass of red wine or coffee now and then is fine in moderation).
4. **Avoiding excessive heat** – I completely avoided saunas and hot baths, as well as anything that might overheat the groin area.
5. **Using a standing desk** – Sitting for extended periods can also be problematic, so I set up a standing desk to help mitigate this issue.

But today I woke up and my dad was having some coffee with a friend while doing a fix in the house, and I just felt like I wanted to have some, spontaneously, I had half a cup, and I kinda liked it and had had more.

Merely getting some coffee necessities was something he felt was below him. However, his tune quickly changed when he realized if someone else took the job, they'd probably mess up and get subpar products.



Rex Diamandis, however, would do no such thing. He quite enjoyed coffee, and was sure as hell not letting anyone give him a subpar cup of coffee! So he took it upon himself to finish this job.



Luckily for one Aubrey Hart, Rex had plenty of money to throw around. While he would not admit to having brought a lot of money with him like the rich kid he was, he would indeed be using some of it on this trip. He looked at his list, trying to decide what exactly he should buy. Coffee filters, an aeropress, and a grinder? Easy. Coffee beans? That might take some thought. He was never too picky, his butler buying varying brands over the years; when someone like him made it, brand was irrelevant.



As he waited to arrive in NYC (with the help of Argus), his thoughts lingered on his butler; Mr. Bentley. One of his few five stars. Not even his own father knew where he went, but his butler did, being one of the few aware of Rex’s true heritage. He never mentioned Eunomia by name, but the man clearly knew why Camp Half-Blood was important to Rex. Mr. Bentley was always the one man he could look to for advice; his father and stepmother were useless on that front. He was like a father to Rex, though that wasn’t something he’d ever admit out loud.



One long drive later, and Rex was back in New York City. Rex tipped the driver a hundred dollar bill, of course (mostly as an apology for dragging Argus all the way here for picking up some coffee).

  
\*\*\*

  
… On second thought, perhaps Rex should have left a note or something for his father about leaving for camp. He had now donned a face mask and took his glasses off because he saw a missing poster for him every few seconds, promising a reward of $10,000 for returning him to his father. Fun.

  
He went into a store that he knew had the supplies he needed, having assisted his butler with getting coffee-related supplies in the past. He got the aeropress, coffee filters, a coffee grinder and… quite a few bags of coffee beans. It was about ten bags of coffee, two for each of the five brands he picked up. He had no clue what brand Aubrey wanted, so he’d leave it up to her. (OOC: I know nothing about coffee, so the brands Rex has picked out are intentionally left ambiguous. Also, these aren't massive bags of beans, these are just the ones you'd find at a store. Though, since it's Rex, assume these are more expensive brands.)

  
As he began checking out, the cashier unfortunately decided to point out a very true fact: “Aren’t you a bit young to be picking up all of this? Do you even have the money?”



Rex scoffed, before responding right back. “Aren’t you a bit old to be working a job like this? And yes, I do have the money.”



It seemed Rex had hit a sore spot, as the cashier paused and replied moments later. “... damn, kid. Alright, whatever. Have it your way then.”



Rex pulled out a few hundred dollar bills to pay for his purchase. When the cashier attempted to give him the change back, Rex held up a hand. “No need. Pocket it; you need it a lot more than I do. Could you give me some quarters, though?""

  
\*\*\*

  
Another session in the arcade. Rex hadn't played an arcade game since leaving for camp, but it was always a guilty pleasure of his. He was also probably a good chunk of this arcade's profit with how often he went here in the past.



Upon beating the final boss of Street Fighter III: Third Strike once again (because this arcade was a godsend when it came to classic fighting games), Rex looked at the leaderboard. He now had the highest score… again. The top 5 places all read: IAM, REX, DIA, MAN, DIS. Rex had carefully made it say his name before, but now that he got first again, he added a little extra with the “IAM” name to cement his dominance. Rex Diamandis and styling on people, name a more dynamic duo.



*… Alright, time to go back to camp; Argus should be picking me up soon. I can’t stall and play games all day… though maybe I should consider getting my arcade cabinet from home* *sometime.*

  
\*\*\*

  
A few hours later, Rex was back at camp, coffee in tow. He thanked Argus for taking him to New York City, and quickly took the coffee products over to cabin 26, where Aubrey stayed. He left a note that basically said *I got all of this, figure out what to do with it yourself.* Though, he may have taken a bit too much glee when writing the postscript, which read:

  
*P.S. If it is up to you to decide, please do not serve any of this coffee to Jaime Northington-Sinclair, son of Nemesis. I would be quite displeased.* *- Rex Diamandis, King of Diamonds.*

  
Rex had no clue if Jaime even liked coffee, but he was both petty and vengeful, especially after [Jaime humiliated him](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1hs1zk8/comment/m6s2qai/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), so it didn't hurt to try. While the thought crossed his mind, he decided against threatening to take his coffee back; that would undermine the point of taking this job. Asking for Aubrey to not serve coffee to Jaime was just a small little shot in the dark Rex wrote there for fun, nothing more.



This job was one small step for Rex and his plan to eventually become a counselor. It was only a matter of time.

Overall insight:  Cafe Affetto makes espresso that tastes nearly as good as Jura for less than 1/3rd of cost (comparing machine costs) and will cut coffee costs by at least a 3rd vs Nespresso.

The biggest risk with all super-autos seems to be break-downs.  I mitigated this risk by paying ~$30 for an extended 3 year warranty.

Notes:

1. I purchased the machine for $215 + tax + 30 for warranty (Walmart.com)

2.  The machine pays for itself in less than a year (in my situation) based on what I save vs Nespresso pods ($700 for beans vs $1,222 for the original pods).  I used the least expensive subscribe and save  price for the comparison of Nespresso pods and $12.99 Starbucks espresso roast beans to give a frame of reference that most US readers can relate to. The economics will get better for bean coffee soon since Nespresso plans to raise prices.

3.  The Cafe coffee sucks in default mode.  Obviously taste preference is subjective but I found the coffee to be excellent once I tweaked settings (finest grind + lots of tweaks for the my coffee button)

4.  The app is a little confusing but there is a tech support phone line if you really get stuck.  Once you get it working the app is impressive in terms of customization options.

5.  The machine comes from the same company that owns GE Appliances so they’ll likely have the staying power to support repair, replacement, etc.   

6.  There is concern that connected devices from large Chinese firms listen and have access to other devices on your network.   This does not concern me but I guess it’s something to consider if security is critical to you

Bottom line:  this is a solid alternative if  you don’t want to shell out for the best super-automatic and a no-brainer relative to Nespresso.   Since Super-automatics break down it’s a good idea to consider buying an extended warranty.  ",0,1737311284.0,superautomatic,1,0.5,False

and my last as I closed my eyes for sleep. 
You were the one for me. 

Despite it all, this somehow turned toxic, and we couldn’t heal. I was always chasing you, trying to hold on, knowing that you would break my heart, that you would leave me again.
What were your running from? 
Where were you running to?
When did wanting me turn to pushing me away and needing space? 
When did the magic end for you? 
When did I disappoint you? 
When did you stop loving me?

I was so in love with you. Despite what you think, I wasn't jealous.
 I was terrified of losing you, and you had made it clear that I couldn't keep you, that I would lose you,
That I could never be enough, That I was not your forever. 
I shouldn't have held on for so long and so tightly. I shouldn't have asked for so much. I shouldn't have loved you so hard. For that, I have been punished, and I am sorry. 

In your letter, you say you hope I can remember the good times once the pain subsides, 
but these are the reasons why the pain cuts so deeply.

I don't want to just be a memory for you, so 
I won't hold on to these memories anymore.
I won't cherish them at all. 
I will forget. 

Despite it all,
you wanted to be free, so my gift to you is that I release you. I let you go. 
I should have done that the first time you pushed me away. Be free.

I hope one day that I will be free as well. 
Free of every memory.
Free of every thought of you. 
Free to find the magic in living again. 
-But for now, I am still crying.

Floor - printed ACM with heavy duty laminate bolted down and routed to shape.

Storage benches - soft side amazon benches.. stupid light and are held to the truck bed with magenta so they’re easily removable

Hardkorr light bar pair - magnetic backs so I can move them to the exterior of the vehicle when we’re at camp

1i553l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1i553l8/someones_been_photographing_me_while_i_sleep/,Someone's Been Photographing Me While I Sleep,"I never thought I'd be the kind of person who'd share something like this online. But after what happened last week, I need someone—anyone—to hear me out. Maybe writing it down will help me make sense of it.

It started with the mailbox. Not anything dramatic, just... something slightly off. A letter addressed to me, but the handwriting wasn't familiar. Spindly, almost spider-like script that seemed to tremble on the envelope. No return address.

Inside was a single photograph. Me, standing in my bedroom, but not from any angle I recognized. Taken from somewhere high up, through the window. And I wasn't looking at the camera. I was staring at something just out of frame, my expression frozen in this weird mixture of confusion and terror.

The timestamp on the photo was from two nights ago. But I hadn't seen anyone. I'm always careful. Always.

At first, I tried to rationalize it. Maybe someone was playing a prank. Maybe it was a weird photography project. But then the small details started accumulating. The way my curtains would shift when no breeze was blowing. The faint scratching sounds from inside my walls—not mice, something more deliberate.

I started checking my locks obsessively. Double-checking windows. But something felt... watching. Not threatening, exactly. Just present. Like a cold breath against the back of my neck.

The next photograph arrived three days later. Same handwriting. This time, it showed my kitchen. A glass of water on the counter, slightly tilted. A shadow just at the edge of the frame that didn't look quite human.

I'm not crazy. I know how this sounds. But something is tracking me. Documenting me. And I can't shake the feeling that these photographs are just the beginning.

Last night, I woke up to find another envelope slipped under my bedroom door. No sound. No indication of how it got there.

I'm almost afraid to look inside.

My hands trembled opening the envelope. Not from fear—or maybe entirely from fear, I can't quite distinguish anymore. The photograph this time felt different. Heavier. The paper stock seemed unusual, almost textured like skin rather than standard photographic paper.

This image was closer. Intimate. A shot of my pillow, taken from inches away. A single dark hair—not mine—curled against the white pillowcase. And in the background, just barely visible, a reflection in the dresser mirror that didn't match my room's geometry. Something angular. Something watching.

I realized then that whoever—whatever—was documenting me wasn't just observing. They were establishing proximity. Testing boundaries. Each photograph felt like a calculated invasion, mapping the intimate topography of my personal space with surgical precision.

The psychological weight of being observed became a physical sensation. My skin started feeling like a membrane too thin, too permeable. Every shadow seemed potential, every peripheral movement a potential breach.

I knew I should call someone. Police? Friends? But how would I explain this without sounding completely unhinged? These photographs were too precise, too deliberate to be random harassment. This felt methodical. Ritualistic.

Something was collecting photos of me.

The final envelope arrived without sound, without warning. Its weight felt significant—substantial in a way that defied mere paper and photograph. When I opened it, the image inside made my breath crystallize in my throat.

It was a photograph of me. Right now. Sitting at this exact desk. Typing these words. But the perspective was impossible—taken from inside my closet, through a crack in the door I'd never noticed before. My fingers were mid-keystroke, frozen in digital amber.

And then I saw it. A pale hand. Just barely visible. Emerging from the darkness behind me. Fingers long and thin, with joints that bent at unnatural angles. Reaching. Always reaching.

I turned slowly. The closet door was open just a sliver.

Something inside was breathing.

Not in rhythm. Not human.

Just waiting.

And then—a soft click. Like a camera shutter.

The breath caught in my throat—a ragged, desperate thing that felt more like a sob than oxygen. Survival instinct kicked in, primal and sharp. I didn't think. I moved.

My hand swept across the desk, grabbing the nearest object—a heavy ceramic mug from last semester's writing workshop. One swift motion, and I hurled it toward the closet door. The crash was spectacular, splintering wood and shattering ceramic in a cacophony that shattered the unnatural silence.

In that moment of disruption, I ran. Not strategically. Not carefully. Just pure, animal desperation. My fingers fumbled with the apartment lock, muscles trembling so violently I could barely grip the mechanism. Behind me, something shifted in the darkness. Not a sound. Not a movement. Just a fundamental wrongness that pressed against my consciousness like a bruise.

The hallway felt like salvation. Fluorescent lights. Mundane carpet. Normal architectural angles that didn't bend or whisper or watch. I didn't stop moving until I reached the building's lobby, my laptop clutched against my chest like a shield.

I'm writing this from a 24-hour coffee shop. Public space. Witnessed space. Somewhere with witnesses. The photographs are in my laptop bag, sealed in a clear plastic evidence envelope. Proof. Documentation. Something tangible I can show someone—anyone—who might believe me.

But I know the truth. Whoever—whatever—was taking those photographs wasn't just watching. They were selecting. Choosing. Mapping something far more intricate than mere physical space.

And I can't shake the feeling that this isn't over. Not by a long shot.

I (F/40) gave up my job to take care of my relative who suffers from COPD and dementia. He's 79 and mainly needs someone around him from the moment he wakes up til he goes to sleep. Basically his whole day has to be structured for him, from giving meds to putting coffee and food in front of him, reminding him to drink and so on.  He gets anxious when noone is around which triggers respitory issues so I'm home 24/7 except we have the privilige and have someone monday-friday from 10-2 who takes care of him. Since I'm single with no kids I use that time mainly to run errands cause otherwise I can't leave the house. I feel I lost the few friends I had cause it's difficult for me to plan ahead, for example when he has a bad day or the help is sick herself. Also my main topic of conversation is the dire situation I am in. I try to talk it positive but it is what it is, my life is on hold. I have his health and wellbeing on my mind and every day without any incidents is a good day. I feel not one of my so called friends can understand how it is to be in such a position.

I took a break from querying while working on other things last summer, but now I'm ready to jump back in. I'm trying a different strategy in this one than my other attempts, so any and all feedback is appreciated! (I can never decide whether or not to pitch this as Upmarket or Literary, or if it's okay to just do both. So any feedback on that is extra appreciated.)

...

Dear AGENT:

I’m seeking representation for THE RUDE MECHANICALS, a dual-POV upmarket/literary novel complete at 84,000 words. It would sit well on the shelf beside a dysfunctional family novel like Stephen McCauley’s *You Only Call When You’re In Trouble* or a trickster tale like Zoe Whittall’s *The Fake.*

After his adoptive father dies, Henry doesn’t know where he belongs. He drinks his way out of college and spirals into an identity crisis that makes him seek out his biological father. He’s never met Liam, a musician in a midwestern Shakespeare company, but Henry’s desperate for a father figure. However, when he asks Liam to meet—Liam says no. His family doesn’t know about Henry, and he wants to keep it that way.

Determined to meet, Henry dons a disguise and pretends to be an actor named “Nick.” He auditions for *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* and charms his way into a minor role\*.\* After he’s warmly welcomed into the theatre community, he and Liam become backstage drinking buddies. Not only can they match each other shot for shot—but it’s the first time Henry’s had a friend who truly understands him. (Or, well, who he’s pretending to be.)

As opening night approaches, their partying creates problems for Liam at home. To assuage his wife, Liam lies about attending AA meetings with “Nick.” Henry’s acting abilities are tested when Liam needs “Nick” to come to dinner and convince his family they’re working the Twelve Steps. At the same time, a cast emergency promotes Henry to a major role in the play. As his lies grow more complicated, the easiest thing would be to quit the play and leave town—but what if Henry’s finally found the place he truly belongs? (Or, well, who he’s pretending to be.) 

I’m a recovering alcoholic from \_\_\_, where I teach college writing. I live with my partner, an actor on the board of the \_\_\_ Shakespeare Festival, and often spend my summers watching them perform. My writing has recently been funded by the \_\_\_\_, and my short fiction has appeared in or is forthcoming from such places as (a few mid & top-tier literary journals). 

Thanks in advance for your time and consideration!  
...

First 300:

Each night Liam watched the lovers die. At rehearsals, they collapsed on one another in t-shirts and yoga pants. At performances, in dresses and doublets. Liam watched them die in high school auditoriums, on stages in old playhouses, in tiny black box theaters, and inside drafty churches. The play always started as a comedy but took a dark turn in Act Three. The dances and revelry became duels and banishments. No matter how many times the same scenes played out, Liam always hoped for new outcomes. For rivals to drop their swords. For letters to find their ways. Even now—closing night, Act Five, in the crypt—he still prayed for a miracle to bring the lovers to back to life. He imagined them running off to the countryside in secret, changing their names, starting new, boring lives. Most people got second chances, after all. Even those who didn’t deserve them.

Fans blew through the church. Rain splattered the stained-glass windows. When Juliet stabbed herself, the actress unspooled red sashes from her dress. Blood and silk. The audience and orchestra remained hushed as she fell onto Romeo. But the quiet moment was studded with doors creaking open and shut. Footsteps. Downstairs, it sounded like an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting was about to start. The rumble broke Liam’s concentration. He could smell their rain-soaked cigarettes in the parking lot, their coffee brewing in the basement. His throat burned. Didn’t they know the lovers were dying?

He counted his breaths and looked to his wife, waiting for her cue. 

When Sabine lifted her baton, Liam drew his bow. Soon the other violins joined, followed by the oboe and flute. The Montagues and Capulets stormed the stage to discover their dead children. The cellist plucked heavy strings.",2,1737310637.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

We had a coffee date and he invited me over afterwards. We ended up having sex and I spent the night and stayed there the whole week. We love bombed eachother and both agreed it was going too fast but the sex slowly turned into making love. 

A week in he sat me down and told me he was still in love with his ex. I got up and left but he told me he was going to stop talking to her so I stayed. Since that point I got very self conscious and we would see eachother nonstop and continued to have sex. He started treating me poorly and told me I was annoying. He would game more often and we wouldn’t do anything I ever wanted to do. He eventually admitted to me he’s only keeping me around for the sex, and I was sad but stayed because I really liked him. We broke things off the day after Christmas, that night he said he didn’t care about me and I was ready to move on. 

A week into our situationship ending I noticed my period was late. I reached out to him asking if he could buy me a pregnancy test and he was livid. After a lot of hassling he bought me one and it came back positive. I was debating on telling him or not because the comments he was making were unsettling. He told me he would hate our baby because of me, he would make sure I got an abortion (he knew I didn’t want one), he would hire a private investigator to watch my house to find out if I’m pregnant, etc… 

I eventually did tell him but it’s just been stressful since. He did stop pressuring me to have an abortion, but hes still trying to get back with his ex. He told me he wanted to raise our baby with her, yet he still agrees to having sex with me. I have feelings for him but he doesn’t for me anymore and the idea of another woman raising my child does tick me off. She doesn’t know I’m pregnant and that we’re still having sex, I’ve been tempted to contact her but I know it’ll make things worse. 

Right now we’re taking some space from each other. I just want to be prioritizing my baby at this point.",11,1737310560.0,venting,42,0.77,False

","I suddenly found out that my body reacts negatively towards anything caffeinated: coffee, black tea, green tea, and now even chocolate. My few joys in life. It's quite saddening that I had to let go of these things but the main issue is the symptoms have been persistent for about 2 weeks now. I've also reduced my screen time on electronics. Sometimes it lifts and sometimes it intensifies. What do I do now? 

Main Symptoms:

""I often experience a floating or weightless sensation in my head, making me feel disconnected from my surroundings.""

""When this floating sensation occurs, part of my head/brain feels denser/stiff and slowly forms in other areas.""

""I also struggle with a lack of focus or clarity, which is sometimes accompanied by weakness or shakiness.""


Additional Symptoms:

""I feel pressure on the sides of my face leading to my ears, which eventually feel clogged or almost blocked.""

""During these episodes, I sometimes get a surge or throbbing, electric-like sensation through my head. My mind goes blank, and I can’t think or recall anything clearly.""

""The harder I try to focus, understand, or remember, the more these sensations intensify, leaving me feeling weak and unable to function.""

""It becomes difficult to articulate my words now"" 

What Helps:

""I’ve noticed I feel some relief when watching TV, talking to someone, or when my attention is drawn away by something else.""

Going on keto instantly clears my sebderm (10+ years of severe sebderm, lots of hair loss, etc) MCT oil did help some. 

Keto foods aren't the only low histamine foods, berries and some other fruits and vegetables. Anything that is a fruit, root, or a bulb vegtable I consume, aside from starches.

(I recommend looking into the plant toxins in some of these vegetables that cause vitamin deficiencies. Brussel sprouts contain more carcinogens than cigarettes. The USDA refuses to fund studies on this, and funds studies that paint all gross tasting vegtables in good light)

So now I follow a strict diet of meat, dairy, eggs, berries. This makes me feel amazing in every way and reduces histamine. I love my sausage and eggs with my fruit smoothies.

It's worth noting some dairy is high in histamine, hinting on how reducing dairy has helped others. 

If you pursue this diet, make sure you are consuming enough fats, and not just lean meat. Not all cholesterol and Cholesterols are the same. Why do I feel better and have better cardiovascular health after upping my Cholesterol? 

I supplement Vitamin D3, 10,000 IU with K2 (D3 toxicity is actually just a K2 deficiency, same thing with zinc with copper.)

I also supplement iodine, and put cacao in my coffee.

","Hi! 24F, 5’4”, 119-122lb, recently diagnosed with very light PCOS. Work out 6-7 days per week and currently training for a marathon, min 10k steps every day, got a body scan and PBF was 11.3. Diet is overarchingly very lean and whole foods, unfortunately I do have a history of ED (bulimia / binge / orthorexia) which sometimes bleeds into my current day, mostly in the form of the latter 2. I’m very disciplined in my supplement routine, take them every morning and night (basics like fish oil, K2+D3, B complex, l theanine, ashwaghanda, magnesium glycinate, berberine some weeks on some weeks off) and additionally take l glutamine most mornings and drink ACV in water before biggest meals. Hypothetically should be a picture of health?

Main sources of protein, ranging from 100-150g per day, I don’t track or any amounts intentionally: 
- 99% lean turkey 
- sirloin steak
- egg whites / eggs 
- lactose free greek yogurt (fage)
- canned albacore tuna sometimes 

Other foods in daily rotation: 
- usually black coffee, sometimes matcha / espresso with almond malk 
- Any type of berry really, mostly blueberries / raspberries / strawberries / blackberries 
- Honeydew melon 
- Banana sometimes if running, paired with pb2 or pb fit smooth peanut butter 
- Purple sweet potato / Orange Sweet potato / Butternut squash / Acorn squash 
- Avo sometimes maybe 
- Broccoli every day basically 
- Kale / onion / peppers / cucumber
- Lentils sometimes 
- Lactose free cottage cheese 
- cocoa powder / SMALL amounts of maple syrup, honey, coconut sugar if sweetening anything 
- Ezekial bread, rarely sourdough if making toast
- Recently eating decent amount of cashews lol 

I try to keep everything as relatively low GI as possible due to the PCOS and it makes me feel more energized. I had a stint where I was eating a ton of fruit all day and had very intense sugar cravings which I have worked on moving away from. 

TMI: But I wake up many mornings and have passed stinky gas essentially all night! Continues all throughout the day, paired with very uncomfortable and visible bloating, 
to the point where it can really interrupt my work day. I’ve gotten bloodwork done a couple of months ago and everything was normal, even my testosterone and insulin levels which can be uncharacteristic  of PCOS.

As a bonus, since I’ve been marathon training, I often have issues sleeping, waking up at 4:00 am without being able to fall back asleep. I am aware that this is likely a result of high cortisol, what can I do to remedy this issue?

 Thank you for your help everyone! ",1,1737310427.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1i54umw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1i54umw/hario_switch_recipes/,Hario Switch Recipes,"I have been brewing with the Hario Switch for years now using Hoffman's recipe in his ""daily driver"" video. I found it quite enjoyable, because it seems to lean into the acidity (or at least my execution of the recipe), and I find I rather enjoy more acidic coffees.

I recently decided to go exploring with different recipes (namely Coffee Chronicler's and Tetsu Kasuya's new recipe), different cones (switching out the Switch's cone with the Mugen cone), with or without Sibarist's booster cone, and more recently bought the SWorks bottomless dripper though I haven't used it yet as I ran out of properly rested beans. 

I am not enjoying any deviation from Hoffman's recipe. CC's recipe comes out extremely bitter. Kasuya's as well, but definitely a lot more palatable than CC's. Adding the Sibarist Booster Cone to Hoffman's recipe is a close second to just his normal recipe, the booster cone seems to make it even more acidic, and is even a bit much for me at times.

Ultimately, I am wondering if there is a breakdown in my brewing technique that is causing my brews to not be as tasty as they should be. I wonder if it can be grind size, the type of water I am using, my water pouring technique, or my proclivity to swirl the slurry to even out the bed are to be blamed. 

For grind size, I do use the ZP6 @ 5.5 with burr lock at 0.

For water, I used the third water wave packets. One stick per gallon of distilled water

My pouring technique, I do find it hard to pour the 45g of water in the initial bloom phase to evenly wet the bed. Finding high 50s/low 60s is needed. So, maybe I am pouring too fast or my circles are too tight? I know with Kasuya's recipe, the bed looks awfully muddy by the end of it.

The swirling. I noticed with my swirling that it causes draw down issues. When I use the Mugen cone in the switch, the water comes out super super slow. So, I think the swirling maybe causing the filter to clog.

My name is David, and I’m a 29-year-old IT tech from New Jersey on a quest for a meaningful, long-term relationship with someone who shares my values and passions.

**A bit about me:**

I’m about 5’10”, bald but naturally blond, and I sport a stylish beard. My usual attire includes black band shirts and black jeans—think laid-back, metalhead vibes with a touch of nerdy charm. If that sounds like your kind of aesthetic, we might just click! (Pics here: [https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0](https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0))

**What I’m into:**

When I’m not diving into the worlds of extreme metal (Black Metal is my jam) or gaming, I enjoy spending time with friends doing things like:

• Camping trips under the stars

• Exploring museums

• Renaissance faire adventures

• Watching movies (especially showing my best friend ones he hasn’t seen)

• Playing board games or video games

Recently, I’ve started learning a new language (こんにちは!) and experimenting with building Gundam model kits.

**Professionally:**

I work in IT and hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. My job keeps me busy but also lets me hang out with a great group of coworkers.

**Personality-wise:**

I’m laid-back, lighthearted, and always quick with a joke to brighten the mood. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs (not even coffee!), but I’m completely cool with others enjoying their drinks around me. My friends would probably describe me as funny, reliable, and someone who thrives on meaningful connections.

**What I’m looking for:**

I’m hoping to meet someone younger (ideally between 18 and 24) who’s also looking to build a future together. I’d love to find someone whose experiences and goals align with mine, so we can grow and share meaningful moments side by side. While I don’t have a timeline in mind for things like eloping or kids, I value the idea of creating a life full of shared adventures and growth.

I’m especially drawn to someone with an average or slim body type. I’m not a fan of tattoos, but piercings aren’t a big deal, so don’t hesitate to reach out if we connect on other levels!

If you’re a fellow nerd, gamer, or someone who shares my love for metal, movies, and meaningful connections, I’d love to hear from you. Send me a message and a picture—I’m looking forward to getting to know you better!",1,1737310385.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

After a **long night of work**, I decided to take a short break. I stretched my legs and stepped out of my room, only to be greeted by an unsettling silence. The hall, usually filled with warmth, felt empty. **The dim light from the nila vilakku (traditional brass lamp)** cast flickering shadows, but the house seemed devoid of life.

That’s when I heard it—the faint sound of water dripping. **Tip-tip-tip**. It seemed to come from the kitchen. My heart quickened as I walked toward it. The neatly stacked steel plates on the counter and the coffee filter stood as usual. The sink was dry, no sign of leakage. Yet, the sound persisted, soft but unnervingly clear.

Brushing it off as my imagination, I returned to my desk. But the silence around me started to shift. Slowly, the sound of dripping water faded, replaced by faint murmurs. It felt as though someone was whispering just behind me, their voice indistinct but chilling. My breath quickened. The air around me grew colder, heavier.

Summoning courage, **I turned sharply—and froze.** There, standing right in front of my face, was a girl. No older than seven, she was dressed in a cream-and-gold pattu pavada (silk skirt), her long black hair cascading over her shoulders. Her face was pale, her eyes wide and hollow, staring directly into mine. Her presence was so terrifying, I felt the blood drain from my face.

I couldn’t move. My legs felt like they were rooted to the floor. My heart pounded in my chest, and my vision blurred. Before I knew it, everything went dark.

When I woke up, the sunlight was streaming into my room. I was back in my chair, drenched in sweat. It was morning, but the night’s events felt all too real. Even now, I can’t shake the image of the little girl. Sometimes, **I hear faint whispers in the stillness of the night. I tell myself it was just a nightmare, but deep down, I know she was real.**

I am re-selling coffee, so I take information about coffees from the roaster’s website and add them on my own.

What I basically do, I:
1.Download the image and resize it in Camva for a specific 4:5 llus skme compression. The I add it to Woo
2.Write a product description and a short description 
3. Add some information in custom attributes like “origin of the coffee, bag weight, tasting notes, etc”
4. Create sku, add the price and stock and thats basically it.

Coffee are changing monthly and I have quite a few hundred.
So I am thinking, how can I automate this?

Currently I am working to test WP all import to import everything from an excel file.
Once I get this done with all columns I need, i will try to use Chatgpt to create that csv file base on some URL I provide from the roasters websites.

Are there any other ideas for this? Maybe I can do it better.
