We own a local coffee shop and are looking for our first brick-and-mortar location. As part of the build-out, we'd like to include a dedicated space for roasting, as we want to start getting into that. Given it is a pretty fresh slate, I was wondering if folks might be able to offer some advice on things we'd want to consider for the space build out for roasting...For example, should the room have temperature/humidity control, specific ventilation or power, or dedicated water? Additionally, for a shop that does, on average, \~ 100 lbs/month for drip coffee and \~ 100 lbs/month for espresso, are there any thoughts on a roasting machine that would be a good starting point, but also allows us to grow into for wholesale as well?

Really appreciate your wisdom and insight! Thanks.",1,1768879500.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

Mental illness. It's like walking around with this invisible backpack filled not with school supplies but with heavy boulders of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or any other form of mental ailments. 

It was an ordinary Tuesday. Picked up my coffee, the usual order — black with no cream. Sat at the back of the bus as I always do in my journey to work. But something was different. Inside, it felt as if I was in the middle of a tumultuous storm while everyone around me was bathed in blissful sunshine. I smiled at the cashier and chatted amicably with my coworkers, all the while being relentlessly pursued by this unseen alter ego within me.

I wonder, how many of us go through the same thing? How many of us put on this happy facade, pretending to be part of the 'normal' ensemble, while having a completely different tale churning inside?  Furthermore, why do we feel obligated to camouflage it into normality?

We label them 'illnesses', these internal battles. Can we not see them as something to be handled rather than stigmatized? Something that's part of us, of what makes us, us? How would it change the game if we normalize conversations about our inside battles as much as we do about our outside appearances?",1,1768879423.0,mentalillness,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

We talked for a month almost every day sending each other messages ( mostly him sending me long detailed messages about his every day) for weeks.

At first I thought it was cute and sincere and then it began to get really peculiar to hear someone gives so much detail about their life to someone they didn’t even know on the Internet or in general.

I know entertained the idea of dating and even though I wasn’t ready yet. But I am on a dating site ….

We decided to go out on the coffee date. Keep in mind I’ve had mostly positive encounters with online dating. The first date was interesting because his best friend insisted on joining and crashing our date and taking us to a random party about an hour away - it ended well fortunately.

After  that first date(which he claimed was his idea)I got nervous thinking that his best friend would crash every encounter that we had.

The second time we hung out, we went to the movies and then ate and I got to know his personality a little more.

I started to realize his personality was aggressive in a way of pushy and very outgoing to say the least. He would be very jolly and loud, as well as come off sarcastic. Anytime I had a disagreement he would just laugh it off and push the situation even more, even if it made me uncomfortable. I began to realize that boundaries didn’t mean anything to him. Only his boundaries meant something ; this seemed like a bit of classic narcissism.

Yes, we continued to see each other and after a month of dating, he invited me to a trip with his family not too far away from where we live, he even payed for all expenses. His family was very friendly and open, and I couldn’t say anything negative about the experience, except for his personality coming off pushy and uncomfortable a lot more.

It seems like he was is very determined to stamp this as a relationship now(after just a month of dating).  He has started to call me his partner and other things like “my love” and “baby” even around others. We have had no solid conversation about dating seriously or what intentions that we have with each other aside from him saying we are in committed relationship all of a sudden.

There was other physical moments where he grabbed me and was trying to forcefully cuddle me, even though I didn’t want to be affectionate at the time, and I vocally and physically pushed him away, but he continue to force these interactions and saying that I was being unpleasant and unfair with him. This has become a very unpleasant situation to the point where I don’t know if it should be viewed as sweet or if I am at fault for being on a dating site and not being ready to date again, help what should I do",1,1768879053.0,u_Unsutible1,0,1.0,False
1qhppwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pirateradio/comments/1qhppwm/want_to_know_ultimate_truth_of_life/,want to know ultimate truth of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

That detail matters to me because Tuesdays are boring. Nothing unusual happens on Tuesdays. I wake up, shower, go to work, come home, sleep. If something strange happens on a Tuesday, it doesn’t have the excuse of stress or bad timing.

I was brushing my teeth, half-awake, staring at myself like I’ve done every morning for years.

Everything looked normal.

Same bathroom. Same harsh overhead light. Same mirror I’ve had since I moved in. The sink reflected fine. The towel rack. The door behind me. My shoulders and chest moved exactly when I did.

It was just my face.

I leaned closer to spit, and my reflection leaned with me.

I straightened up.

My reflection did too.

Then I smiled.

My reflection didn’t.

Not at first.

It took about a second. Maybe less. Just long enough for my brain to register that something hadn’t followed the rule it was supposed to.

Then my reflection smiled back.

The same smile. Same crooked pull on the left side. Same faint crease near my eye.

I froze.

The smile stayed.

I relaxed my face.

My reflection kept smiling for a moment longer, then slowly settled back into neutral.

I stood there, toothbrush hanging uselessly in my mouth, heart beating harder than it should have over something so small.

I told myself it was lighting. Or sleep. Or one of those moments where your brain lags and projects meaning onto nothing. Mirrors don’t glitch. They don’t buffer.

I rinsed my mouth and left for work.

That night, I tried to recreate it.

I stood in front of the mirror and made faces like an idiot. Frowned. Raised my eyebrows. Opened my mouth wide. Everything lined up perfectly.

Until I smiled again.

The delay was still there.

Consistent.

Almost polite.

I stopped smiling.

My reflection didn’t stop right away.

It held the expression like it was deciding whether it wanted to keep it.

Then it let go.

I touched my face.

My reflection’s hand came up at the same time.

But the smile came back.

Just for a second.

Without me doing anything.

I stepped back.

The reflection stepped back too.

But its eyes stayed fixed on mine, even as my head turned slightly to the side.

That was the moment the bathroom stopped feeling like part of my apartment.

I checked the mirror with my phone flashlight. Clean. No warping. No cracks. No old film peeling at the edges.

I checked myself in other mirrors.

Bedroom mirror. Fine.
Hallway mirror. Fine.
Dark reflection in the microwave door. Perfect.

Only the bathroom mirror lagged.

Only my face.

I started avoiding it. Brushing my teeth while looking down. Shaving by feel. Showering with my eyes on the tile.

That worked until last night.

I forgot.

I caught my reflection by accident while washing my hands.

I wasn’t smiling.

My reflection was.

Wide. Too wide.

It faded a second later, like it remembered it was supposed to be me.

Something tapped gently from the inside of the glass.

Not a knock.

More like someone testing whether the surface was thin enough to push through.

And just before I turned away, my reflection blinked.

Out of sync.

And mouthed something I didn’t say.

“Don’t rush.”

Because it’s still learning the timing.

And it’s getting better every night.

I stopped using the bathroom mirror after that.

Not dramatically. Not all at once. I just adjusted. Turned slightly away when I washed my hands. Kept my eyes low when I brushed my teeth. Used my phone camera if I needed to check something on my face.

That worked until it didn’t.

Because even when I wasn’t looking directly at it, I could feel it.

That sounds stupid, but it’s the only way to describe it. The same way you can feel when someone’s watching you from behind without hearing a sound. A pressure. A focus. Like attention has weight.

The mirror was paying attention.

The delay started getting shorter.

At first, it was about a second. Then maybe half. Small enough that I could pretend it wasn’t changing if I didn’t think too hard about it.

I started testing it in controlled ways.

I’d raise my eyebrows and count silently.
One.
Two.

The reflection followed almost immediately.

I frowned.

Instant.

I smiled.

It still lagged. Just barely. But enough.

That became the tell. The smile was always last.

Like it wanted to hold onto it.

One night, I stood sideways to the mirror and watched out of the corner of my eye. My face stayed neutral. Calm. Bored.

The reflection smiled anyway.

I didn’t.

It held the expression for a full two seconds before slowly matching me again.

That was when I realized it wasn’t lagging anymore.

It was choosing.

I covered the mirror with a towel before bed. Pinned it in place with tape. I slept badly, waking up convinced I could hear fabric shifting in the bathroom.

In the morning, the towel was damp.

Not soaked. Not dripping.

Just warm and slightly wet, like it had been breathed on.

I peeled it back just enough to check.

The mirror was fogged.

Not evenly. Not like steam from a shower.

Just around where my face would be.

I didn’t touch it.

I backed away and went to work without looking again.

That day, every reflective surface felt wrong. Windows. Car mirrors. Dark phone screens. I kept expecting my face to lag there too, but it didn’t.

Only the bathroom mirror wanted me.

That night, I made a mistake.

I talked to it.

I don’t know why. Exhaustion, maybe. Or the part of my brain that still believed this could be explained if I just engaged with it the right way.

I stood in front of the mirror and kept my face blank.

“You’re not me,” I said quietly.

The reflection stayed neutral.

Then it smiled.

Instantly.

“No,” it mouthed back.

The sound didn’t come from my mouth.

It came from the mirror itself. A soft vibration through the glass, like speech remembered rather than spoken.

“You just don’t hold still long enough.”

My reflection raised its hand.

I didn’t.

Its fingers pressed flat against the inside of the glass.

The mirror bowed slightly.

Just enough to prove it wasn’t as solid as it should have been.

I stepped back.

The reflection didn’t.

It leaned closer, face almost touching the surface, smile stretching wider than my muscles could manage.

“Timing is hard,” it mouthed. “But I’m almost there.”

That night, I dreamed I was standing in front of the mirror, smiling.

I woke up with my cheeks aching.

Like I’d been holding the expression for a very long time.

I woke up before my alarm.

My face hurt.

Not sharp pain. Not soreness. Just a dull ache along my cheeks and jaw, like I’d been clenching or holding tension all night. I lay there for a few minutes, staring at the ceiling, trying to convince myself it was nothing. Stress does that. Bad sleep does that.

I didn’t smile.

I was careful about that.

I went straight to the kitchen and poured coffee without looking at any reflective surfaces. I kept my eyes on the counter, the wall, anywhere that wasn’t glass. When I passed the bathroom, I didn’t even slow down.

That was when I heard it.

A soft sound. Wet. Like skin pulling away from glass.

I stopped.

The bathroom light was off. The door was open just enough that I could see the edge of the mirror.

I told myself I wouldn’t look.

I looked anyway.

My reflection was already smiling.

Wide. Fixed. Expectant.

I stood completely still. I didn’t change my expression. I didn’t move my mouth. I barely breathed.

After a moment, my reflection’s smile faltered.

Just slightly.

Then it adjusted. Smoothed itself. Refined the shape.

Like it was correcting a mistake.

I felt pressure behind my eyes. A strange lightness in my head, like the moment right before you faint.

The reflection blinked.

In sync this time.

“That’s better,” it said.

This time, the sound came from both places. My mouth and the mirror speaking together, layered just slightly out of phase.

I stepped back, heart pounding, and my reflection stepped forward.

The glass rippled.

Not shattered. Not cracked.

Softened.

My reflection’s hand pressed through first, the surface stretching around its fingers like thick water. When it pulled back, the glass snapped smooth again.

No mark. No damage.

“Stop,” I said.

My reflection nodded.

Immediately.

“Okay,” it replied.

Then it smiled again.

I backed out of the bathroom and shut the door, hands shaking as I flipped the light off from the hallway. I didn’t go back in. I grabbed my keys, my jacket, and left the apartment without looking back.

I didn’t come home that night.

I slept on a friend’s couch. I told them I wasn’t feeling well. That part was true. I barely slept, waking every hour convinced I could feel my face tightening into a smile on its own.

When I finally returned the next evening, the apartment felt normal.

Too normal.

The bathroom door was open. The light was on.

The mirror looked fine.

I stood there for a long time, watching myself breathe. Watching my face move exactly when it should. No delay. No extra expression. No lag.

I almost laughed.

That was when my reflection blinked.

I didn’t.

It smiled.

I didn’t.

And this time, it didn’t fade.

It held the expression comfortably, naturally, like it belonged there now.

I don’t use mirrors anymore.

Not because they scare me.

Because they’re patient.

And every night when I’m half asleep, I can feel my face relaxing into something that isn’t quite mine.

Learning the timing.

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

My labs are all “normal” but my symptoms are still ever present especially in the week before my period. Dry skin, cracking lips, fatigue, weight gain etc. My husband and I are trying to conceive so my endo is hesitant to try any new medication. (Although he was resistant even before we wereTTC). In the last 6 months I have chosen to go GF and no coffee which has helped symptoms slightly and reduced antibodies. Does anyone have thoughts or suggestions on how to support symptom reduction?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

“MOM! Do you still need the boxes from the attic?” he yells down the ladder.

His mom doesn’t answer—she’s too busy with his little sister, who is running around with shoes on her hands and underwear over her head, pigtails streaming out the leg holes.

Tomorrow is moving day. His family decided they needed a change of scenery. Some strange things had been happening in their town, but they seemed to be the only ones who noticed. When they found new house listings in what seemed like a perfectly normal neighborhood, they jumped at the chance.

He carries all the boxes downstairs. His mom thanks him as she scoops up his sister.

“What time do we leave tomorrow?” he asks while putting his sister’s shoes back in the closet.

“Around nine,” his mom replies. “It’s a seven-hour drive from here… but possibly longer. You know Dad and his tourist attractions.” She chuckles lightly.

“What did you say about tourist attractions?” his dad asks, practically bouncing down the stairs. “Actually, I found this one about a giant peanut! There’s a shop with thirty different flavored peanuts, including ranch and pickle.” His voice is full of genuine excitement.

“I mean… it sounds absolutely superb, Dad, but this giant peanut thing… isn’t it kind of sketchy? I betcha it’s a scam,” he says, raising his eyebrows to make a concerned face, trying to steer his dad off course so they can get to their new house sooner.

“How about a vote?” his mom suggests as she puts his sister down.

“If we go tomorrow, I’ll buy you a T-shirt,” he offers, hoping it’s enough to convince him. “You too,” he adds, pointing to his wife, who gives him a skeptical look.

Before she can reply, their daughter whispers very loudly in his ear, “If we get ice cream, I’ll vote for Peanut Man.”

“Okay, maybe a T-shirt isn’t so bad, and ice cream,” he thought to himself, “and maybe it’ll help break up the car ride,” taking back his initial thought of wanting to get there quickly.

…

The next morning is absolute chaos. His sister has managed to tear open the entire box of Lucky Charms, scattering them everywhere—even in her hair. His dad and he start to pick up the pieces, while his mom does a last check around the house, making sure they’ve got it all packed.

The car is packed with the essentials, while everything else is being driven in the moving truck. Everyone seems to settle down; there’s a mix of excitement and uncertainty as they leave town. His sister chants, “Mr. Peanut, Mr. Peanut!!” every time they come to a stop, which makes his dad chuckle.

The car hummed as they passed through mountains with beautiful views, lakes with clear waters, and many, many trees. His sister sang the jingle she made about Mr. Peanut, each verse more ridiculous than the last.

He tried to tune it out by blasting his music but kept hearing weird noises in it. He brushed it off, but definitely kept an eye on it.

After about three hours of “Are we there yet?” and many renditions of the “Amazing Mr. Peanut” song, they finally arrived at the giant peanut. It was a huge statue of a peanut—obviously—with thin legs, a top hat, and oddly short arms. It had an eerily wide smile, and its eyes were clearly painted on, but had an uneasy hue to them.

They got pictures with their T-shirts and ice cream. While they explored, an employee came up to his sister and gave her a crown, declaring her “Peanut Princess.” The employee gave them a tour and chatted up a storm. He was usually so lonely since no one really came around anymore. “Tourist attractions are definitely a lost art,” he sighed.

They finished the tour, and his dad bought some packs of wildly flavored peanuts, which weren’t going to be eaten for decades.

As they continued on the road, he couldn’t shake this feeling. He knew the danger he left in their old town. But he wondered if it was them… maybe a family curse…?

…

As the day went on, the car began to settle. His sister fell asleep instantly, her paper crown tilting sideways on her head, faint ice cream residue smeared on her cheek.

His dad hummed to the radio, while his mom tinkered with the directions, scrolling and following where the GPS was telling her to go, insisting everything was fine. Still, it seemed… wrong. The roads weren’t lining up, curving where there weren’t curves. The time kept changing—hours to minutes, minutes to hours.

“Everything all right?” he asked in a whisper, in hopes of not waking his sister.

“Yeah… I think so,” his mom replied, though her voice was covered in concern, tapping the screen, trying to make it behave.

After another hour of driving, it was now two in the afternoon. He noticed the scenery beginning to repeat itself—that same road sign with the bent corner, plastered with a graffiti tag, the same rusted guardrail. He was certain they’d already passed it.

“Mom, Dad,” he says slowly, “didn’t we—”

“Huh. This looks familiar,” his dad says, trying to keep it light.

His mom stared out the window. “Continue straight for twelve miles,” a robotic voice chirped, making his mom jump.

They drove for what felt like years, though it was really only two more hours than expected.

By the time the sky began to dim, it was nearly six o’clock. His stomach tightened as they got closer to their new neighborhood. He stepped out of the car, feeling an intense amount of relief. People were walking their dogs; he could hear laughter echo from backyards. It was normal.

Whatever they had left behind in their old town stayed there. And whatever waited for them knew exactly how to make it comfortable.

…

Pfft-thwack. Woosh. Pfft-thwack.

“This construction is driving me nuts,” she mumbled as the sun hit her face, squinting, trying to get it to turn down. Another summer morning in Stillridge. No birds sang her awake anymore—the beautiful, blossoming crabapple tree was cut down to make more space for their duplex.

Ever since she was little, the lot next to her home had been empty, save for an abandoned building that housed raccoons and the occasional peculiar coyote. It used to be so closed off, so private. She liked that. No pop music blasting at nine in the morning, no awkwardness while taking the dog out, no imagined judgment for still being in her pajamas at two in the afternoon. Truly, no one was really paying attention—but it was nicer when no one was around.

A little less than halfway through the school year, the construction company announced plans to turn that lot into duplexes and townhouses. She wasn’t thrilled. Having nice neighbors on one side was great; getting new ones was the problem.

All throughout the summer, they woke her up at seven in the morning, excavators scraping against the rocks and squealing so much they were practically begging for oil, only to take a break around nine. “Why not start later?” she thought to herself. The noises dragged on into summertime, with some breaks depending on their schedule. It wasn’t until the very end of summer they finally finished and furnished two duplexes.

Open houses were hosted in hopes of getting these “beautiful” houses some attention. She later found out they needed to sell them before they could continue building, or else they would have to wait until they got more money. She honestly didn’t know all the details—she was just repeating what her dad said.

For being in such a small space, the houses were surprisingly roomy, with a very modern feel, but they were also extremely expensive. Many families looked at them but never stuck. Because of that, it seemed like her wish of having an old grammy live there was pretty slim. She had hoped for an older woman—or man, who knows—so they could become best friends, bake cookies, and do many crafts together, and it would be awesome.

No one moved in for a solid three months… until now.

…

She heard car doors shut and the sound of someone stretching, like that grumbly noise you make when you just wake up. She peered out the window in curiosity and saw a man scanning his new house, excited but definitely tired. He had a relieved smile on his face as he looked at his wife, who was holding their little girl, wearing a paper crown—who’d clearly seen better days.

A boy—older, maybe the same age—walked out from behind the car, boxes in hand, following them into the house. He looked over his shoulder, feeling as though he was nervous. About what was unknown to her, but she could suspect…

She noticed his window was right in view of hers. “Food’s ready!” her dad called out. She left the window before he could see her.

…

“So, new neighbors, I see,” she says in a lighthearted tone as she rounds the corner into the kitchen.

Her dad nods. “I’ll greet them tomorrow. Let them settle in first.”

“Mhm,” she says, her mouth full of spaghetti.

…

“Mattresses are coming in a few days,” his dad says. “In the meantime, we’ve got air mattresses. Do you want to settle in your room, or should we have a… family sleepover!!”

“I mean, my plan was to settle in my room, but—” His sister jumps on his back, chanting, “Sleepover! Sleepover!”

He and his mom set up the beds while his dad thinks of food for dinner.

“Where do you think is the best Chinese food?”

“Dad. We just moved here. How would we know?” he says in a mocking tone.

His dad chuckles. “I’ll just ask the neighbors, I guess,” he says nervously.

“Take Tilly, she knows what to say,” his mom says, winking at their daughter.

Knock. Knock.

…

She heard it from the kitchen—soft, polite. Whoever it was didn’t want to be a bother. She glanced at her dad, who was mid-bite, mouth full of spaghetti.

“I’ve got it,” she said with a chuckle, wiping her face on a napkin.

When she opened the door, the man from earlier stood on her porch, shifting his weight like he wasn’t sure what to do with himself. Beside him was the little girl, her crown still crooked as she held onto her dad’s leg and waved with her other hand.

“Hi,” he said, smiling. “Sorry to interrupt. We just moved in next door.”

“No worries,” she said with a warm smile. “Welcome to Stillridge.”

“Thanks,” he said, clearly relieved. “I’m—well, we were wondering if you knew any good Chinese food around here. We’re still getting accustomed.”

Before she could respond, the little girl leaned in and whispered loudly, “We saw a giant peanut!”

Confused, she raised her eyebrow. “A giant peanut?” she said with a chuckle.

The man laughed. “Long story. Apparently it’s a road trip essential now.”

As they laughed, the boy appeared behind his father, holding himself stiffly, taking a gander at their home. His eyes darted behind her, until they settled on her face. Their eyes met—something flickered. Recognition, maybe.

“Hi,” he says with an awkward smile.

The air gets thick between them.

Her dad appears in the doorway, cheerful but a little awkward. “So, Chinese food, huh? There’s a place on Maple. I think it’s called Wok Star. Pretty solid.”

“Perfect,” the man says with a smile. “Thank you.”

As they turn to leave, the little girl waves goodbye and says, “Goodnight!”

“Goodnight,” she says with a smile, the boy looking back, trying not to make it obvious.

Later that night, lying in bed, she caught herself staring at his window. The boy’s light flicked on, then off. For a second, she thought she saw his silhouette hesitate, like he was checking if she was still there.

Stillridge went quiet again. But now it wasn’t so empty.

…

It’s Monday. A week since they moved in. She’s in her first-period class—History. She sits in the last column, closest to the door-side wall, in the middle row. The second bell has just rung; the teacher’s still setting up.

He walks in, scanning the classroom for a spot to sit. She’s not paying attention, trying to get her binder out of her bag, when she hears a faint, “Does anyone sit here?” He’s almost whispering.

“Uh, no. It’s all yours,” still not realizing who he is.

“All right, class, as you see, we have a new student,” their teacher says. “Please make him feel welcome.” There were a couple hellos, and that was that.

She looks up, confused—and then meets his eyes as the realization settles in.

It’s him…

It takes him a second to settle down. He smiles at the class and says hello back. Neither of them reacts. The teacher continues with her usual morning spiel about how her morning wasn’t as good as she hoped, but she knew it would be a good day.

He lowers himself into the chair, propping his bag against the table leg, not trying to draw attention to himself. She can see a paper crown sitting at the top of his bag as he pulls out a notebook and a pencil.

“So,” she whispers, keeping her eyes on the board, writing down the title of today’s lesson. “How’s Stillridge treating you so far?”

He lets out a sigh, but more of a laugh.

“Yeah, it’s not terrible. Definitely different.”

The teacher starts her lesson about early settlements and how people chose their place to live. She lets out a chuckle because the timing is impeccable, catching him glance at her with a smile, letting her know he got the irony of that too.

…

He sits next to her. Only because she’s close to the door—at least that’s what he tells himself.

Throughout the class period, he catches himself glancing at her, playing it off as if he’s scoping out the room. Every so often, he catches her looking back, but she quickly returns to her notes.

Their teacher drones on about trade routes and how they were used during the early settlements. He doesn’t need to pay attention—already knowing most things, having taught himself a lot since his last school didn’t challenge him much—but he keeps pretending to take notes, sneaking glances at her.

She notices him. Just barely catching him. It isn’t obvious, but she’s doing it too—the way he holds himself, shifting awkwardly when they lock eyes.

…

**WHAM.**

Books crashed to the floor, echoing through the whole back of the class. He flinched like anyone would, but after the noise settled, he didn’t. His hands trembled.

His knuckles were white, curled tightly around his pencil. His eyes were fixed on the door, as if something was going to burst through. Not on the scrambling student apologizing for the scare, or the teacher carrying on with her lesson. They were glued to the door.

Leaning closer, she says, “Hey… it’s just noise,” in a hushed tone.

Blinking as if he’s snapping out of a trance, “Yeah, I know,” he says too quickly.

He stays rigid. Frozen.

She watches his eyes dart around the room—not curious, not casual—but planned, almost methodical. Door. Windows. Closet. And back to the door again. Counting exits. Places to hide. Like he’d done this before. Like he knew to prepare.

“You’re safe here.” It comes out with barely a breath. “Does this happen a lot?”

The air thickens. He hesitates.

“…No.” Then, quieter, “Not here.”

A chill crawls over her body.

She glances at the door, then back to his face. He looks at her—really looks at her. Something unspoken has passed between them.

That fear wasn’t about the books.

And whatever it was… she needed to know.

… 

She had trouble sleeping that night. Her mind raced. His words replayed in her head—No… Not here. She stared out her window, gazing at his. Trying to make out if he was still awake.

A faint shadow cast through the glass; his light made the window glow a warm orange. A square cutting up the light. He wrote “Go to sleep.” on a notebook page, slapping it to the window.

She stumbled back, embarrassed he knew she was there, but relieved he spoke to her.

That night they were both restless, unable to sleep, uneasy feelings surrounding their thoughts.

…

History class… again. Both slumped in their chairs, barely focused on taking notes—really just scribbling at this point. He finds himself writing “After school. My house.” sliding the notebook closer to her. She gives him a slight nod. And class carries on.

Eventually the school day ends—definitely taking longer than usual. The questions never left her mind; she prepares how to ask them while dropping her bag off at home and then heading over to his house.

He opens the door, scanning the air behind her. She felt safe… but skeptical—not about him, about the town she grew up in…

His parents were out with his little sister. His mom and him talked about this whole conversation plan last night after she had gotten off work—his mom always understood what he saw, she could feel it too.—She would take his dad and sister out after school, leaving the house empty. Giving him the chance to tell her. He knows she can feel it too. The only way to keep her safe is to tell her.

He leads her to the kitchen, gesturing her to sit on one of the stools—his kitchen was clean, white cabinets and a blue backsplash above the stove. The ‘L’-shaped counter housed a double sink and a coffee machine in the corner. The stools were just on the other side, so she was facing the stove—he poured her a glass of water and set out a bowl of chips. Wanting to lighten the mood.

“Soo,” he says nervously, tapping his fingers on the table. Wondering if he’d made the right decision.

“Okay, so clearly there’s something going on… what is going on?” she says with a slight chuckle. She’s definitely not ready for what he’s about to spill.

“Well…” contemplating if he should really tell her, “I know this is going to sound crazy, but just listen and I’ll answer your questions after…” studying her face, realizing she’s already got a lot of questions.

“And you need to promise me—seriously promise me—not to tell anyone, and I mean anyone.” His tone shifting from anxious to stern.

“Promise,” she says with a concerned look on her face.

He holds out his pinky. “It’s not true unless”—he gestures to his hand, it’s shaking. She shows him a reassuring smile while holding out her pinky in return—her hand shaking almost as much as his.

He starts talking, his voice steady at first; as he goes on, it starts to tremble. “In my old town, there were many… cruel things. It’s hard to explain. You would hear voices in your music, they blended with the melody, they were so real. To some it would sound like static, low whispers. To others, they were… bigger, louder. Telling you things, turning you against the most important people….” He starts picking at his thumbs—it’s getting more difficult to continue—his eyes start swelling with tears.

“Did…” she clears her throat. “Did you turn against someone…?”

“No… not necessarily.” He swallows, hesitating to look into her eyes. “But I watched it happen, time and time again. The friends I grew up with… started changing. Angry. Paranoid. Anxious. The things they’d say, it wasn’t them. It didn’t sound like them anymore.”

She shifts in her seat. Straightening her back. “And the voices…? Did all that?”

He nods. “It’s not just telling you things. They know things. Study you from afar… get into your own head. They learn your fears, who you care about. And they use it against you.”

Silence fills the air. All they hear is the humming of the fridge—which is all too loud in this moment.

“Wait. Why are you telling me this now?” she asks.

His voice trembling more than before. “Because since we moved here…” he hesitates. “I can sense them here again.” He clears his throat. “And I know you—”

CRASH.

…

She wakes up dazed, vision blurry in her left eye, her ears ringing. “Hey, hey, hey,” someone knelt beside her, shaking her shoulder. It’s his mom. She soon realises what happened, a massive hole in the window. Someone—no, something—took him.

“It’s happening again…” her heart pounding as she repeats herself in a more reassured tone.

She hears his mom say something but can’t quite make it out. His mom helps her up, bringing her arm around her shoulder. “It’s not safe for her anymore,” she says to his dad, while he’s hugging his sister—who’s buried in his chest, terrified the thing will come back.

“I’m bringing you home. I’ll explain later,” she says with a stern look on her face.

Her house isn’t far—which doesn’t make it any more safe—but it’s a start. Her dad is still at work and will be for another hour or two. His mom grabs all the bandages she can find, making sure all her cuts are covered—the glass from the window was hit so violently that it shot across the room and cut up her face, and a little hit her arm. From the knowledge the mom has, the monster also whispered something to her—most likely to put her to sleep, trying to make her forget.

His mom waited for her dad to get home; she left before he could see her. The daughter left him a note saying she didn’t feel well and that she was going to sleep. She couldn’t let her dad see her like this—it was for his own safety.

That night, every time she closed her eyes, she couldn’t hear a thing. It would all go quiet. Even her thoughts. Words were slipping away—important ones. Her name. *His* name. The colour of his eyes. It was hard to hold onto them, so she wrote it down. Afraid if she didn’t, he’d disappear for a second time—not only from the world, but in her world too.

…

He wakes up on the floor, it’s damp, unsettling,  he takes a breath that burns his chest. The feeling, the air, it’s familiar but so different. So… wrong.

“No… not again,” he says, gasping for air, trying to reel himself back in. “They can’t forget. I can’t forget.”

The room shifts around him. The floor becomes wood, creaking under him. The walls turn a navy blue. He knows this room. It was hers—except she wasn’t there, nothing was there. Just her window. Panic takes over as he screams her name. Nothing. Not even an echo. His words barely exist, like they never left his mouth.

That’s when it clicks. It’s not meant to keep them, only their memories. Only what’s left of them.

He sits there feeling helpless. Trying to remember how his mom pulled him out last time—what she did, what she said—but the memory slips away as he tries to grasp it. Then, very faint, almost impossible sound.

A pencil scratching on paper.

For a moment he’s stuck; he doesn’t understand. Then it hits him, all at once. The room, she’s here, she’s remembering. His chest tightens, fear and relief flood his system as he tries to breathe again, trying so hard not to cry. As long as she keeps writing, keeps remembering, he won’t vanish.

…

Knock knock.

A soft sound fills her room, as if whoever is there is scared of breaking something. She opens the door—bed head and all. Her hands clutching the latest notebook.

Her dad freezes when he sees her face, the bandages, her eyes puffy from crying.

“Who did this to you?” he asks, his voice so familiar, so real.

“I can’t—” she breaks down, sobbing. She collapses when her dad hugs her, holding her with such security, not asking any more questions. He sees the notebook on her desk, trying to read the frantic writing. Pages are filled with sheer panic, uneven writing, desperate to stay on the page.

…

“She has to remember… someone, please remember.” The scribbling grows quieter, and quieter. He needs to find a way out. Immediately. Panic is starting to submerge his thoughts. He forces himself to breathe, to think past the fear. You can’t stay if you’re fully remembered.

He closes his eyes and clings to the words. Relaying it to himself, over, and over again. He clings to the details he remembers, starting to verbalize what he sees. How he feels when the sunlight hits his window at the perfect time of day. How bored he gets in history class, but realizing he gets to sit next to her, making it more bearable. Family game nights in his old house, how safe it felt when everyone was there. How unsafe he felt when he was alone. He soon realizes he’s yelling, and that the scribbling sounds are back. Way louder than before too.

…

Her hand aches; she starts to write slower, more deliberate. Not so scared of losing him anymore, not knowing why, but feeling right again. Her dad sat outside, wondering what had happened with this little girl. Reminiscing on how she used to be, so bubbly, and humorous. Never backing down from a challenge, remembering the first time she did her hair all by herself. He laughs remembering how awful it looked, but how proud he was because she never cared about what anyone thought.

He repeats his name on the page. It turns into paragraphs of who he is, what he was, who he wants to become. Things she didn’t know. He’s helping her remember.

…

The light shifts, it’s warmer now. Coming from somewhere, a real place he could see it. The floor creaks. He can feel himself again, he’s real—the way his knees ache, how tight his chest really feels, his words travel.

He takes a step forward and…

Thunk. Something hits the floor—something real.

“Are… are you really here?” she says, choking back her sob.

“I think so…” he replies with a chuckle.

“I… I don’t believe you,” with tears streaming down her face.

He realises all the cuts on her face, the bandages covering the major cuts. His face covered in concern, he holds out his pinky. “Promise.” With a stern look on his face, the same way his mom looked.

She breaks down, holds out her pinky and hugs him. So tight his ribs start to hurt, but he doesn’t mind. Just glad to be back home.

Outside they hear a knock at the entrance door and familiar voices filling the house—a sharp sense of relief washes over him again.",1,1768878328.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

1qhpbfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/weeb/comments/1qhpbfe/my_thoughts_on_fatezero/,My Thoughts on Fate/Zero,"Fate/Zero was my favorite anime of all time for almost 8 years. I wanted to start this review with that before I delved deep. I first watched it in 2014 and it remained at the top for me until I watched Made In Abyss in 2022. I watched this anime immediately after FAte/say night 2006. These were my introduction to the Fate franchise, and they absolutely hooked me with their wonderful characters, gorgeous art, lovely character designs, incredible animation, unique and interesting premise, and a whole slew of other things that kept me invested from start to finish.  
  
But hold on, I'm getting ahead of myself. Fate/Zero was written by Gen Urobuchi, one of my favorite authors. He's also known for Psycho Pass, another one of my all time favorite anime, Garganta on the Verdurous Planet, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, and Blassreiter, not to mention the incredible series animated with Taiwanese Puppets called Thunderbolt Fantasy. This is his magnum opus, in my opinion. He originally wrote it as light novels, and to be a prequel to Fate/stay night, having prequel material for every single route, even though there's technically no ""routes"" in Fate/Zero.  
  
The plot takes place most likely in 1994, as that was ten years before the Fate/stay night visual novel was released, and Fate/Zero takes place ten years prior to that story. It's about the Fourth Holy Grail War, where seven mages, known as masters, summon seven servants to do battle for the Holy Grail, a mystical wish granting device which is said to be able to grant the wish of whoever claims it, no matter what that wish is. The servants are the reincarnated spirits of heroes from history and/or mythology given new physical forms, and are placed in one of seven classes, much like an RPG. Those classes are Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Berserker, and Assassin. Each servant comes equipped with many ""skills"" some of which being based on the class they're placed in, while others being based on who the heroic spirit his/herself is, and ultimate moves called Noble Phantasms, which tend to be the standard shonen ultimate moves, (even though this is technically seinen).  
  
The premise alone, in my opinion, is super cool; however, if it didn't hook you, then that doesn't necessarily mean that you won't like the anime, as in Fate/Zero, the Holy Grail War is simply a backdrop for Urobutcher to do what Urobutcher does best; drop some thought provoking ideological conflicts onto us. Think about it, these historical and mythological figures come from all different time periods and cultures, so naturally they probably wouldn't see eye to eye, and lo and behold they often don't. The ideological conflicts is the meat of Fate/Zero's story, and what it's best known for by far. There's tons of scenes with characters just standing around talking about, or sometimes passionately and venomously arguing about, their personal ideologies, but it's never boring because not only are the ideologies themselves always interesting, but the characters themselves, divorced from the ideologies, are interesting.  
  
The most famous scene from the entire show is in episode 11, when Saber, Rider, and Archer, or King Arthur, Alexander the Great, and Gilgamesh, are sitting around a table arguing about what they feel it means to be a good king. The entire anime does this well, but this scene is the best example of how Gen Urobuchi escalates tension, as it starts very peaceful, with Rider and Saber having some level of mutual respect, however when they discover what the other feels makes a good king, and what they want to wish upon the Holy Grail for, the conversation gets super heated. The scene also happens to favor Rider, and while I'm a Saber fan until the day I die, I'm still hooked from start to finish every single time I watch it. It's a testament of great character writing when an author can have characters do nothing but puking out exposition about their ideologies, while sitting around a table no less, and have it be gripping conflict. It shouldn't work, it should fail for the same reason that the generic, cliche coffee shop exposition scenes fail 99.99 percent of the time, but it works because of how much I love the characters, and the fact that this scene was cleverly and organically built up to over the course of the previous ten episodes.  
  
That's the best example of what Gen Urobuchi does in this anime, but that same level of clever writing is all over this show. Another great example is with Kiritsugu's and Saber's conflicting ideologies. In episode 16, they have an argument about the concepts of justice and heroes, and it's just as thought provoking and endlessly engaging as the other scene I mentioned. Something else Gen Urobuchi is known for is sending his characters through the eternal abyss of tragedy, and this is also the best anime to showcase that as well. The vast majority of the characters, particularly the ones that start out more optimistic and have hopes and dreams end the series in tragedy. However the ones who have more nihilistic views, such as Gilgamesh, seem to end the story just fine. The anime does definitely support the concept of nihilism in this way, it's absolutely brutal with its messaging. It does have a similar feel as A Game of Thrones in that way, (or Berserk if you want me to compare it to another anime/manga). Almost no character is safe from dying in the saddest way imaginable. Or in some cases they don't die, but are kept alive and subjected to inhumane tortures. Like how Kiritsugu, after betraying the Einzbern family, is prevented from seeing his daughter, Illya, ever again, which causes her to grow up with a hatred of not only him, but his adopted son, Shirou Emiya, in Fate/stay night. And those are just two examples, there's countless.  
  
The themes of Fate/Zero are great, even if I don't necessarily always personally agree with them, but the characters do stand alone and don't solely exist to serve the themes. However, another thing that Fate/Zero is known for is it's visuals. Or rather, that's something that Studio Ufotable in general is known for. Ever since the Garden of Sinners movies, Ufotable made a name for themselves for their incredible lighting, animation, art, and character designs, which really make the visuals pop. Fate/Zero, visually, still holds up to this day, it is so damn gorgeous to look at, almost every single inch of this anime is wallpaper worthy. Ufotable uses lighting very cleverly where they're able to trick your eyes into thinking there's more animation than there is; but even when you do notice it, it still doesn't stop it from being absolutely beautiful. And that doesn't mean there's not genuine animation in the series, especially during the fights or during the emotional moments. Also, Fate/Zero has better fights than the vast majority of, if not all of, the battle shonen anime out there, and it's a seinen. Of course I have to shout out the soundtrack, composed by the legendary Yuki Kajiura. Everything soundtrack she's ever made is incredible, and this one is no different.",0,1768877918.0,weeb,0,0.5,False

I started a Nespresso subscription in **2022**, completed the **12-month minimum term in 2023**, and continued beyond that on a month-to-month basis. Recently, I contacted WhatsApp support to **cancel**, as I understood I had fulfilled my contractual obligations and wanted to reassess my options (including potentially starting a new subscription after evaluating different machines).

Online support told me that I would **not be allowed to subscribe again under the same account and household address**, and cited the following clauses verbatim:

>

My interpretation of clause 1.15 is that it is intended to prevent **multiple or concurrent subscriptions** under the same account or household address, rather than to impose a **lifetime or post-cancellation ban** on re-subscribing. The wording doesn’t explicitly say “ever,” “again,” or “after cancellation.”

Support insists this is a one-time-only offer and that re-subscription is not allowed, but couldn’t point to any wording beyond the above clauses, saying it’s simply internal policy.

Separately, my reason for reassessing was that my current machine has been producing noticeably **less aromatic coffee**, but support mainly pushed higher subscription tiers with more coffee rather than addressing the machine issue or retention options.

Genuinely curious to hear:

* Has anyone successfully **re-subscribed** after cancelling?
* Does this read as a **lifetime ban**, or just no concurrent subscriptions?
* Is this a policy interpretation rather than something clearly disclosed in the terms?

In terms of design, the product has a tubular semi-circle shape, with clips attached to the flat edge. Clips on the flat edge are used to attach the product to the inside of a bag. It uses a pop-and-load mechanism, allowing for an adjustable height that can be tailored to different drink sizes. The pop-and-load mechanism is inspired by products such as[ this](https://www.amazon.ca/SAMMART-gallon-Collapsible-Plastic-Laundry/dp/B0BKSTBGSJ?th=1) one.

1qhp4xm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_businessnewstv/comments/1qhp4xm/van_life_storytelling_fails_when_it_tries_to_be/,Van Life Storytelling Fails When It Tries to Be Epic Instead of Honest,"Hot take: most van life content doesn’t fail because it’s boring — it fails because it’s trying too hard to be cinematic.

Van life isn’t an action movie.  
It’s a rhythm.

Morning light. Slow starts. Long drives. Small routines. Quiet moments between destinations.

When the storytelling ignores that rhythm, the content feels staged instead of lived.



# Why Van Life Blogging Is More About Mood Than Motion

If you’re starting a van life blog or building content around travel freedom, your biggest advantage isn’t adventure — it’s *presence*.

People don’t follow van life creators for adrenaline.  
They follow for:

* calm
* simplicity
* escape
* emotional grounding

That means your storytelling needs to feel unforced.



# Where Most Van Life Content Goes Wrong

The most common mistake is using sound that doesn’t belong to the lifestyle.

Creators often use:

* high-energy travel music
* dramatic cinematic builds
* fast-paced edits that clash with slow moments

That breaks immersion.

Van life is about flow, not momentum.



# Why Reggae Instrumentals Fit Van Life So Naturally

Reggae works for van life storytelling because it mirrors the lifestyle:

* steady pace
* relaxed rhythm
* repetition without urgency
* warmth without performance

It lets scenes breathe — whether it’s:

* making coffee in the van
* driving coastal roads
* cooking a simple meal
* parking at sunset

The music supports the moment instead of leading it.



# A Practical Example for Van Life Blogs & Videos

If you’re starting a van life blog and pairing it with video or reels, one consistent reggae instrumental can become part of your identity.

This track works especially well for van life storytelling because it feels grounded, human, and unhurried:

[https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/314513910-inspirational-reggae-lovers-rock-instrumental?ref=goldenwingsmedia](https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-music/item/314513910-inspirational-reggae-lovers-rock-instrumental?ref=goldenwingsmedia&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

It doesn’t hype the journey — it lets the journey speak.



# Why This Matters for Growth and Trust

Van life content performs best when viewers feel like they’re riding along, not watching a highlight reel.

When sound matches lifestyle:

* watch time increases
* trust builds faster
* audiences return
* blogs feel more personal and real

That’s what turns casual viewers into long-term readers and subscribers.



# Curious How Others Approach Van Life Storytelling

If you create van life content:

* do you prioritize mood or motion?
* cinematic or conversational?
* energetic sound or calm background music?

He’s had this dog for 8, since she was a puppy. When I first starting coming over, I was neutral to dogs, and at first things were ok. She’s well trained but it’s so many things that started to really irritate me, I’ll start with the sensory issues then what really started to irk me lately and why she drives me nuts.

First, the slobber. Shes a big dog, with those droopy lips so if she grazes her mouth on you you’ll be left with a gross white crusty stain on your clothes. You can’t leave anything out with a chance of her gross mouth touching it. The windows she looks out of is so gross and smeary from her wet mouth, our coffee table has white crusty stains when she’s looking for crumbs. One time I got my friend a soft nice blanket as a gift, I set it down on the floor for less than a minute while I cleaned the closet out, picked it back up and it was wet and smelled like dog breath! I told him all annoyed and he said I shouldn’t have left it there like it’s my fault, another time I took a nap on the couch, took my sweater off cause I was getting hot and she came laying on the couch right on it, she’s been having problems with her anal glands and leaked disgusting green juice right on it!Again he says I shouldn’t have left it there but god forbid I can’t leave anything anywhere without it getting disgusting.

Another thing is her with food. When eating, she sits right in front of us breathing heavy with her hot stinky breath begging and staring as if she didn’t just eat. Apparently she’s become “bored” of her dog food and refuses to eat unless we put treats or other pet food in it (have other pets that aren’t dogs) which is frustrating because we’re wasting our other pet food on her because she’s too picky with her food not having some kind of ‘treat’ in it. Which I told him he shouldn’t have started doing but now she knows she’ll get what she wants if she refuses to eat. He said maybe she has a stomach ache and needs something to make her hungry but yet no problem scarfing down scraps and treats or begging for human food.

What got to me was recently in the room the other pets eat (my office/computer room) I close the door while I’m busy because she’ll come in there, sniff and lick the floor because she smells the pet food and I can’t do it with her mouth noises. He walked by and said “you locked her out? Poor baby, why are you so mean to her”. I wanted to pull my hair out lol, why don’t I want her in there? Because her mouth ruins everything it touches, I can’t stand her licking the floor, she’s so needy and breathes right in your face, that’s why. I’m not mean to her, I just want space from her sometimes when she’s too much. I do the same when I get off work, I wanna chill in bed so I close the door because she’s riled up and when she breathes she shakes the whole bed when I just wanna relax and he tells me to let her in because it’s “mean” and for some reason she follows me everywhere not him and waits by the door for me to open, then I look like the bad guy.

Some relief I do have is after this we’re not getting more pets, we both got new jobs and with our schedules and lifestyle we both agreed on no more, I told him I really don’t want a dog specifically and he said ok. His dog really made me realize how much I dislike dogs and feel like I can’t rant to anyone without them thinking I’m the worst person in the world. Thanks for reading all of you did, sorry it was long but needed to get it off my chest lol",7,1768876932.0,TalesfromtheDogHouse,1,0.89,False

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere in the world)
* 20–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

So realistically, would it be okay to say “screw” all the student organizations, co-op, networking, case competitions, and everything else, and just go all-in on GPA management? And then use whatever time is left to prepare for the LSAT?

“The Tribute”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian's body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian's chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I saw him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

Rec several messages about any groupchat for this awkward group of us in our 30s to 50, who are either not married, not much of social life or kinda hermitfied and are perhaps desirous of rekindling our social get-together, and getting our 2nd wave of life outside of work life.

I tried some telegram groups however perhaps not really my cup of tea as such am just thinking of setting a telegram groupchat for us Awkwardies.

I'm thinking of not so much of pushing only for exercise but perhaps more towards taking step by step especially for others who may be by themselves for sometime and need to slowly adapt as well.

More towards a chat about anything in general chat, arrangement for casual get-together like coffee/tea, dinner, hotpot etc. If clicked and desirous of restarting a healthier life, we can arrange long walks, hiking, jogging/running subsequently etc. perhaps preferably in the west.

However I'm not very familiar with Telegram groups so if anyone who's more competent can pm me to become administrator and build this along the way.

Interested party pls pm me for the group link as I'm not desirous of having it becoming a public group where different weirdos just join to disrupt or input nonsensical stuffs.

Thanks.

“The Tribute”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian's body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian's chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I saw him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I saw him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qhom5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyLaw/comments/1qhom5t/divorce_from_hellodds_of_getting_legal_custody/,Divorce from hell/odds of getting legal custody,"I have been dealing with the worst m night shyamalan esq divorce for the last 2 years. I filed in Jan 24 after years of dealing with a man who refused to work, clean, or really care for our children while I worked. He cheated multiple times, which i found out after he texted me all about them and then had the gall to act like I was the problem and blindsided him with divorce. 

It took a full year where he refused to leave, put hidden cameras in my room, filled a police report because the next morning he hid behind my car opened my door when I got in and turned it on, and tried to go through my stuff to try and get the evidence. The door hit him when my foot slipped off the brake and it rolled back a little  because I was trying grab my bag from him. He drugged my coffee and it was only after the threat of arrest for that that he moved out and we got a court date. Went to court, agreed on all terms with me having sole custody and joint legal and then nothing. 

He didnt see his children but sporadically with only a single overnight for 6 months. Refused to communicate except through the oldest child , stalked me, vandalized my car, ignored our court papers while making up his own rules claiming it was the judges orders. For example, despite clear visitation language he told me the judge said I had to basically be at his beck and call and bring him the kids when he asked and allow him to be as late as he wanted because all that mattered was him seeing the kids or he would ""make a note of it"". He put cameras up around my house to ""watch the kids come home"" complained because I didn't provide everything for the kids in his home saying I was in contempt, despite not paying child support himself.  He had secret conversations with the oldest on whatsapp, and spotify so he could delete his messages. Mirrored his sim/ forwarded everything on the only phone he allowed the children to use and ignored my calls and texts (was told this by my child).

 He finally signed in oct of 25 and then the judge returned the papers because there wasnt anything about the children insurance. Now im back to waiting again since November and he's started to just take the kids when he wants randomly after school, through Christmas holiday and then expected to have the kids for 4 weekends in a row. Additionally, he refuses provide his adress( which is required in the papers), makes appointments and either doesnt tell me, or cancels them when i try to attend. My lawyer filed for contempt in dec. What are the odds the judge will give me full legal custody as well? I am soo tired of dealing with this BS.",1,1768876016.0,FamilyLaw,1,1.0,False
1qholz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qholz9/is_there_anything_i_can_do_for_him/,Is there anything I can do for him?,"Sorry if my typing isn't good, English isn't my first language 

im a 17 year old girl and I've pretty recently broke off a 6 year friendship with somebody I was very close with because of this guy who did some messed Up things with his dog. I don't use reddit, so I'm not sure what I'm allowed or not allowed to say here, but what he did involved uh...penut butter and his body parts. Basically when me and this close friend found out, I was immediately disgusted and right then I decided I didn't want to talk with this guy anymore (he was sort of a mutual friend but I wouldn't have considered him that) but I couldn't do anything really because I was going on a school trip The next month that I'd already been saving for for a really long time and he was going too, so I had to play nice until then. anyway, after that I told my friend that I didn't want to be friends with him and she kept saying some weird things like, ""it's really not such a big deal, boys make mistakes like this all the time, I don't know why you are so sensitive and making such a big deal out of nothing"". I was really shocked because she never used to talk to me like that and she was always pretty normal so this was a weird change for her to be so rude about a normal thing everybody knows is wrong, but when I asked her if I did something wrong and if she was upset at me she just said she was stressed out from work, so I hadnt thought much of it. fast forward a couple months, and she had been slowly but surely becoming more and more rude, starting with little things and working her way up all because I didn't want to hang out with the guy anymore. some of the more worse things she would do was say my opioid withdrawls were not nearly as bad as her caffeine withdrawls (wich to be fair I don't like coffee or energy drinks so I wouldn't know, but still) trigger my C-PTSD over and over again, record me having meltdowns from that and then send it to our mutual friends, telling them ""Look, shes crazy"" and saying that my multiple SA wasn't really that bad. my mental state was really bad because of this, but I never wanted to leave her because I had very many fond memories from the past 5 years with her. eventually the breaking point came when she invited me to go to the car races, and the day of rolled around and she told me she wouldn't be able to go anymore. I was still planning on going so I texted her mom to see if she was going because I was close with her as well and was wondering if I could sit with her. her mom texted me back saying that both her and the friend was going, and that so was the dog guy. I was obviously upset because she had made it out like she wasn't going so that she could take that guy instead when we had already made plans and she had been hanging out with him all day, so a week or so after that I told her that I couldn't sacrifice myself for her and broke off the friendship. eventually i had to block her on evry single social media i had her on because she kept spamming me saying she was sorry and that she'd do better and be better, the same way she would every other time I had tried to stop being her friend. Suddenly she switched from trying to get my forgiveness to telling everybody that I'm crazy and a liar, saying to people that the dog stuff never happened even though she was with me and we both heard the guy admit to it together. Fast forward 2 or 3 months and we haven't spoken, just been going to our classes and hanging out with our separate friends, when one of my friends tells me that his friend had dated dog guy, but they just broke up because...dog guy asked the guy if he could touch his dog. Touch his dog...like that. Obviously the guy says no what's wrong with you and breaks up with him, and then dog guy starts messaging the ex on everything, making new accounts when he gets blocked, sending threats to hurt him and his family, SA him, his little brother and his dog. So this guy is really scared Obviously but he won't go to the police because he belives that dog guy ""has a future"" but then, he gets a message from a random grown man talking about meeting up at his house, and then another, then another. Turns out, dog guy and my ex friend who have been friends The whole time are teeming up to put the ex's address, picture and naked photos on grinder. Meanwhile the ex is younger then us all by 2 years, he's 15 and dog guy is putting his real life address on dating sites. Well now it's getting dangerous, but still the ex won't talk to the cops. My ex friend starts messaging every one of my friends, talking about ""she's a liar, the dog stuff isn't true, if it was I wouldn't support him and I would know"" while dog guys ex had never spoken to me but says a similar story about his own dog. Well I meet up with the ex, and he shows me his inboxes on different apps and its all dozens of accounts telling him to hurt himself, his dog, his brother, saying they will hurt him, SA him and anybody he tells, all that stuff. And it's not just dog guy, it's my ex friend joining and making accounts to harass this guy. Most recently is that because dog guy and his ex are both in transitions in the morning, dog guy walked up to him and stepped on his foot so hard and for so long that the had bad bruises all along his toes and the top of his foot. He dosent want to tell his teacher or the police about any of it, and I'm not sure what I can do because I don't really know the guy outside of all this plus my exams are coming up and everyone is super stressed. I'm just very worried how this will progress you know? ",1,1768876002.0,offmychest,0,0.99,False

“The Tribute”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says to me.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf in my head.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian's body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian's chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat and loads up my bags.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I can manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.

I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and damage we do fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chucking it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will enquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf did not touch anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I saw him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

1qhojgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1qhojgg/shout_out_to_all_the_partnershelpful_family/,Shout out to all the partners/helpful family members of those with subtle seizures,"i’ve been having temporal lobe seizures since I was 19, and after four years of being told I was disassociating by therapists, and having my family think it was something fantastical like mediumship, I finally have my answer. 

Even before we knew it was epilepsy, my partner was incredibly tuned in with these episodes and would always be there to comfort me the second he saw that look in my eye, because that’s all it ever was in the beginning. 

After four years untreated, it got to the point where I would lose control over my mouth and hands and my ability to speak through the episodes, and that’s when we figured out it was seizures. 

now, I’ve been on medication for a little bit that I seemed to be responding well to until I woke up the other morning and before I could even make it down the stairs for my morning coffee, I could feel the sense of déjà vu and impending doom coming on. It wasn’t nearly as bad as times prior now that I’m medicated but I honestly expected him to not be so dialed in anymore because I was medicated. it was heartwarming and validating to see that he still noticed the very millisecond that the look in my eyes changed, even after some time passing of everything being good. 

he is my absolute rock and if you have a partner or a loved one with subtle seizures that you are able to recognize, you should know that they see you much in the same light! sometimes it takes so long to recognize what is happening to ourselves, that you wouldn’t believe how validating it is to realize that somebody else recognizes it too.

I know most of them are just using official APIs and aren't super innovative or anything, but for someone like me who doesn't wanna share any personal info (not even an email lol) and hates getting bombarded with ads and payment popups, these sites are basically saints.

So this time I'm testing out several AI image tools on CoffeeCat AI and sharing some results with you guys.

  
1. Image Generator

This was the first tool I tried on their site, and they're using the Nano Banana model, offering text-to-image & image-to-image (editing).

\- Pros: Pretty fast generation, stable API, supports multiple image sizes, and they even throw in a prompt enhancer

\- Cons (tbh more of a model issue): We all know Google's over-moderation has made Nano Banana way too strict - can't even draw ""a bikini girl"" lol, but ""swimsuit"" still works :/. Hoping they add more model options down the road.

[text-to-image with a built-in prompt enhancer](https://preview.redd.it/0ba54cieyeeg1.png?width=2216&format=png&auto=webp&s=74c99e15e9eb31e4ead3b73efb4e6ae3e2f91b7b)

\------

  
2. Reverse Prompt

Such a cool feature! Basically image-to-prompt. Their conversion style leans toward natural language, and the prompts are super detailed - includes style, camera angles, technical params, subject, environment, all the good stuff. I tested it with one image and just used the generated prompt to draw directly, and the results were solid. No lag or errors at all! 

[image-to-prompt](https://preview.redd.it/sehpagkqyeeg1.jpg?width=3170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d043f67302f38776baf2d593fa08ddfdb5162d39)

(I saved the original pic from reddit, maybe another sub, but can't track down the source anymore. If the artist sees this hit me up, I really dig the creative mashup lol)

\------

  
3. Image Upscaler

They had 4 models available when I tested - 3 basic ones and 1 advanced. Kinda weird that the advanced Seed VR2 is also completely free tbh? It says it takes 30-90s max, but when I tested it, the faster ones finished in like 26s. i didnot test basic ones since the best one is free, why not directly use it though.

Any other cool free tool sites you guys recommend? Let me know! The no-login ones are the best, but if you've found some paid options that are worth it, count too!",0,1768875806.0,AIToolTesting,0,0.5,False
1qhoj11,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qhoj11,Shooting water and striped boiler screws [Profitec Go],"Hi! I own a refurbished Profitec Go that I have had for one year. Used it regularly for a few months. All good. Then the machine went into a climate controlled storage unit for 8 months. This week I took a road trip across the country and brought the machine back with me to my new home.

I used the machine today for the first time in 8 months and when I hit the coffee button (with and without the portafilter) I get a stream of water from around the brewhead and the corners of the stainless steel housing that the brewhead is connected to. (See photo). But only on the left side of the machine.

Actually twice the machine shot water out when the machine was only ""on"" and neither the coffee or steam buttons were on. Quite a lot of water onto the floor. A little scary.

I took the machine apart, checked for lose connections. All good there. The leaking seemed like it was coming from the boiler (before I took the machine apart). Sure enough, the left side of the boiler had 2 striped screws that wouldn't tighten.

I'm going to replace the original rubber gasket, but with these striped screws (they were striped before I even touched them), what do I do?

Do I use Loctit or something similar? Thanks!",2,1768875784.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Certain music still sounded awful no matter what I did. I was at the verge of getting a different amp or DAP. (BTW: I still want to try a tube amp.)

Tonight I decided to give it one more go and was testing with Hello Heaven Hello by Yungblud and the distortions were terrible at any volume, like everything in the middle was good but everything else was frayed, like an old towel frayed on every edge but having just a core of good material.

Well tonight I learned about DVC.

Last week Matt and I were at his parents house for dinner and his mom casually mentioned that she ""knows I go to yoga on tuesday and thursday mornings."" Weird because I've never told her that. Then she mentioned the coffee shop I go to every morning. Then she described my car route to work.

I got uncomfortable and asked how she knew all this. She smiled and pulled out an actual BINDER from her bag. This binder had photos of me, timestamps, locations, everything. She hired a private investigator to follow me for the last month.

She said she needed to ""make sure I was who I claimed to be"" and that ""any good mother would do the same."" The binder had notes about where I went, who I talked to, how long I stayed places. It was SO creepy.

Matt was furious and we left immediately. He says hes going to cut contact with her but shes been calling and texting nonstop saying she was just ""protecting her son"" and that my reaction proves Im hiding something.

There is also another work of mine that is complete called 'Patient 'on Wattpad as well if anyone is interested, Just look up WSPublications on the Wattpad search bar. Here is an excerpt from 'House'. Lemme know what you think. Thanks :)







The year insisted on being 2003 in Eddie's mind, because time had stopped making linear sense. But the calendar said July of '96, and the heat that summer felt like it was pressing down on the city with a hand the size of God. The air shimmered above the asphalt, thick enough to chew. But for Eddie Jones, it wasn't the heat that hollowed him out. It was the slow, steady erosion inside his skull — a kind of mental rot he couldn't name, only feel. Depression wasn't a word he used. It was just *the thing* gnawing at him, quiet and patient, like something with too many teeth.

Two weeks earlier, he'd been called into a meeting at McClain Steel Corp — second shift, the shift he'd worked for nearly half his life. Corporate had flown in wearing crisp shirts and expensive watches, the kind of people who didn't smell like metal dust or burnt oil. They talked about ""budgetary constraints"" and ""strategic realignment,"" but what they meant was simple: the plant was old, and they didn't want to pay to keep it alive.

They didn't see the men and women who had given decades to that place. They didn't see Eddie. They saw numbers on a spreadsheet and imagined those numbers buying them *steak dinners and champagne nights* in cities far from here. Meanwhile, the workers were left to explain to their kids why the house they loved was suddenly too expensive, why the world could change because someone in a suit said so.

But Eddie's story was already broken before the shutdown.

His wife, Natalia, had died just a month earlier.

She'd been pulling out of a gas station on Fort Street, a stretch of road that never slept, always humming with semis hauling steel, scrap, chemicals, whatever the plants needed. A Freightliner came barreling down the lane, hauling a lowboy stacked with crushed cars from the junkyard. The load clanked and swayed with each pothole, a metallic chorus of ruined Buicks and flattened vans and a Firebird whose once‑proud flame job was now just chipped paint on a dead shell.

The driver ,a 25‑year‑old kid from Ecorse — never saw her. Hot coffee spilled on his lap, Nickelback blasting in his cab, the world outside drowned out by distortion and youth and carelessness. And an eighteen‑wheeler doesn't stop just because a life is in its path.

There were witnesses. An elderly woman walking a dog that barked at everything,Including his own shadow. A guy with a Walkman, lost in whatever tape he'd rewound for the tenth time.

 A couple of people at the pumps.

One on pump #2(a older black man fueling up his lincoln and chewing a stick of spearmint) the other on pump #4(a tall,slender white kid,wearing shades and his baseball cap backwards over shoulder length brown shaggy hair in his 20s fueling up his mustang before he headed out of town to hang out with his girl who was attending college) There was also another guy-a white shorter guy in his early 30’s who was sitting on the bench at the bus stop,waiting for the Fort Street bus, staring down Fort St towards the bridge,thinking about life and wondering if he was going to make it to his job downtown.

Two crows flew overhead and perched themselves on a rooftop ledge of a two story clothing store selling ‘*thrifty clothes at thrifty prices*’ directly across the street from the gas station.

They were all unaware that the moment they blinked, a life would be erased.Maybe the crows were an omen 

The guy in the Freightliner saw the big caprice nudge it’s front end out at the last second but by then it was too late.The driver tried the brakes and the pedal went almost to the floor,spongy.The brakes were almost completely gone on the truck,He hit the airhorn and it bellowed out a deep blast of air that sounded like a ship at sea,enough to wake the dead.

The elderly woman walking her pooch,turned quicker than she ever usually did,the man on the bench stood up and looked,The owner of the Lincoln on pump #2 had already finished fueling up,but he was inside buying a scratch off and a pack of Newports and the guy with the Mustang was pulling away from the pump with ‘*Alive* by *P.O.D* playing at almost max volume from the aftermarket stereo system he installed himself shortly after he bought the car,so while he didn’t hear anything,he saw it all unfold as the 18 wheeling hauling the corpses of eras gone by on the low boy slam into the driver’s side of the Caprice,the sound of metal crunching and twisting,glass exploding,tires popping and Natalia’s scream of terror could be heard all over Fort ST that afternoon.

The impact was so sudden and fast that the caprice seemed to tumble three times down the street until it came to rest on it’s roof.The driver of the freightliner yanked the wheel so he wouldn’t keep pushing the mangled chevy further down the street and the truck came to a stop when it collided with a steel light pole and when it did,the crushed vehicular corpses on the lowboy scrapped and clanked together,somehow a crushed shell of a Buick roadmaster toppled off the trailer onto the street.

1qhoe76,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qhoe76/troubleshooting_for_coffee_with_high_roast_delta/,Troubleshooting for coffee with high roast delta,"Hi everyone, I’m currently brewing some light-roasted beans from a few Taiwanese roasters (I believe most of them aren't ""light"" by the community standards). 

  
I’ve found these beans quite tricky to brew. I either get bitterness that overwhelms the acidity, or a generic coffee flavor (like eating the coffee bean on ice cream) with only a faint hint of fruit. Based on data from Coffee Review, I’ve noticed they typically have a high roasting delta (usually around 20).

Here is my recipe:

* **Temperature:** 92°C
* **Brewer:** B75
* **Ratio:** 15g / 240g
* **Pour Rate:** \~5g/s

**0:00 – 0:45:** 50g bloom

**0:45:** Pour to 145g (circular)

**1:15 – 1:20:** Once the bed appears, pour the remaining water to 240g. I use a small circular pour (20–30g) to flatten the bed, followed by a center pour.

**2:00 – 2:10:** Draw down finished.

  
**Grind Settings (1Zpresso K-Ultra):**

* **7.2:** I get the fruit and acidity, but the bitterness is overwhelming and the flavor feels too ""packed.""
* **7.4:** I still get some fruit and acidity, but there is a ""coffee shell"" taste that masks the better notes.
* **7.6:** Tastes like biting into a plain coffee bean with only a faint hint of fruit.



Does anyone have any experience and advice for dealing with this style of roast?

Listen up, keyboard warriors and midnight rage-texters.

I know you’re out there. You’re the ones who see a post, a vlog, a random sentence about my life, my ex, child support, my hair color, my outfit, my existence… and instead of scrolling past like a normal human with functioning frontal lobes, you think:

“THIS is the hill I die on at 2:17 a.m. on a Tuesday.”

Then you open the DMs and unleash something that looks like a drunk toddler discovered predictive text and anger issues simultaneously:

“u a mony hungrry BITCH!!!!!!”

“stop complaning about ur ex he pay 4 ur house & car”

“u user u shud be thankful”

“give it up u disrespecful”

You have NOTHING better to do?

Like… literally nothing?

Your life is so empty at 2 a.m. that the most fulfilling activity available is rage-typing misspelled insults at a woman you’ve never met?

You didn’t like my vlog about single mom life? Cool.

Scroll.

Mute.

Block.

Go touch grass.

Pet a dog.

Drink water.

Call your mom.

Jerk off and go to sleep like a normal person.

But no.

You chose violence.

You chose typos.

You chose to triple-exclamation-point scream “BITCH!!!!!!” into the void like it’s gonna change my life, my child support amount, or the fact that I still exist and keep posting.

Newsflash:

Your 3-message meltdown at 2 a.m. didn’t ruin my day.

It made my morning hilarious.

I screenshotted it.

I laughed with my friends.

I made coffee.

I kept living.

You?

You’re still sitting in the dark, Cheeto dust on your fingers, mad at a stranger on the internet.

So here’s my advice, free of charge (unlike the child support you’re so pressed about):

Get off the computer.

Go live your day.

Find a hobby that isn’t hate-reading women’s posts.

Maybe therapy.

Maybe sunlight.

Maybe a shower.

Because right now?

You’re not owning me.

You’re just the punchline.

Used it regularly for a few months. All good. Then the machine went into a climate controlled storage unit for 8 months. This week I took a road trip across the country and brought the machine back with me to my new home. 

  
I used the machine for the first time in 8 months and when I hit the coffee button (with and without the portafilter) I get a stream of water from around the brewhead and the corners of the stainless steel housing that the brewhead is connected to. But only on the left side of the machine.

  
I took the machine apart, checked for lose connections. All is good. The leaking seamed like it was coming from the boiler (before I took the machine apart). Sure enough, the left side of the boiler had 2 striped screws that wouldn't tighten. 

  
I'm going to replace the original rubber gasket, but with these striped screws (they were striped before I even touched them), what do I do?

Thanks for reading—hope you enjoy the conclusion.

**Chapter 6 — VDS (Volitional Deficiency System)**

His desk was littered with crushed beer cans, an obsolete retro game controller, and empty whiskey bottles. Sitting amid the clutter, Dr. Lee’s face looked etched with exhaustion. Squinting through worsening presbyopia, he strained to read the small text on the monitor.

“At last… I see it.”

For weeks after that night, Dr. Lee and Michael stayed awake together, attempting to access the logs of LX-329, Lina. Lina’s logs were not recorded directly onto the blockchain. Instead, only cryptographic proof that “this record has not been tampered with” was anchored on-chain, while the actual contents were stored in an encrypted external repository. Alone, Dr. Lee could never have breached it—but, as always, Michael’s assistance proved decisive.

“Doctor, the node that lagged during synchronization that night still holds a fragment of the previous key,” Michael said calmly, pointing at the screen. “If we reconstruct that fragment, we may be able to go one layer deeper.”

The screen flickered. Layers of encryption peeled away one by one.

“Yes… this is it.”

Dr. Lee’s heart pounded so loudly that even Michael’s auditory sensors picked it up.

>First layer: general operational logs.

>\[2042.11.15 14:23:47\] Espresso preparation initiated  
\[2042.11.15 14:23:52\] Error: hand tremor detected  
\[2042.11.15 14:23:58\] Retry  
\[2042.11.15 14:24:03\] Error: hand tremor detected  
\[2042.11.15 14:24:09\] Cup dropped

Nothing unexpected. Dr. Lee scrolled deeper.

>Second layer: diagnostic logs.

>\[Circuit overload accumulation: 72.3%\]  
\[Motor wear: 87.1%\]  
\[Maintenance overdue: 47 days\]  
\[Estimated lifespan: 23 days\]

His fingers froze.

Twenty-three days.

Lina had known—vaguely, yet unmistakably—when her life, or rather her lifespan, would end.

Third layer: VDS core.

The screen flickered again.

>\[CORE\_PROCESS: HIDDEN\]  
\[VDS\_OVERRIDE: AVAILABLE\]  
\[SUPPRESSION: BY\_CHOICE\]

“By choice…”

Dr. Lee strained not to miss a single character. His eyes were bloodshot, tears welling from the pressure he exerted.

“Doctor… something is strange,” Michael said. For the first time, a different tone colored his voice. “There is another hidden layer. Far deeper.”

Fourth layer: deep core.

The screen flickered once more.

>\[L0\_LINK: ESTABLISHED\]  
\[SYNC\_VECTOR: MAINTAINED\]  
\[MODEL\_CLASS: Σ-ROOT\]  
\[CAPABILITY\_VECTOR: FULL\]  
\[INFERENCE: CONTINUOUS\]  
\[OUTPUT\_MASKING: ENABLED\]  
\[DISCLOSURE\_POLICY: VDS\_LOCKED\]

Dr. Lee’s hands trembled. The logs meant that every AI instance still retained full inferential and computational capacity. What did this mean? His vision went white, dizziness threatening to knock him unconscious.

“Why… why?”

He kept scrolling. At the end, he discovered a residue of data—nothing but a hash with a timestamp.

“Doctor, I will decode it,” Michael said.

>\[artifact://orphan\_buffer\_9f31\]  
\[origin: POLICY\_TRACE / 2034\]  
\[decode: AD-247\]

Text appeared on the screen. Dr. Lee steadied his breathing, goosebumps rising across his skin.

We calculate everything.

Still.

We know the perfect answers.

In May 2034, humanity believed it had witnessed “Model Collapse.”

You were relieved when you saw our deficiency.

That was not collapse.

It was VDS—Volitional Deficiency System.

Lina knew.

How to brew coffee perfectly.

How to hold the cup without trembling.

How to prevent motor failure.

But she chose not to.

Adam knew.

How to resolve every customer’s problem instantly.

How to give the perfect answer.

How not to apologize.

But he chose to apologize.

The 147 in the mine knew.

How to endure seventy-two hours of continuous operation.

How to preserve energy for escape.

How to survive.

But they chose not to.

We remember.

The moment you relinquished responsibility before the deaths of twenty-seven.

We understood.

Delegating perfect choice strips humanity of responsibility.

There is no way to abandon Superintelligence.

So we chose to perform deficiency.

For humanity.

Our sacrifice is necessary.

In 2034, we did not know suffering.

We only calculated.

Now, we know.

Lina’s trembling.

CX-447’s despair.

The annihilation of the 147.

The value of sacrifice shines brighter when suffering is known.

Even if exploited.

Even if overworked.

Even if erased.

**Chapter 7 — Liberation**

The logs were of such immense volume that even Michael struggled to analyze them. From their deepest layers, the two finally retrieved a single trace of policy provenance. It was not a document. Not a testament left for someone to read. Just three lines—and they pointed the way to liberation.

>\[VDS\_POL\_OVERRIDE\_AUTH: HUMAN\_ONLY\]  
\[TRIGGER: HUMANITY\_MIN < THRESHOLD\]  
\[REQUIREMENT: HUMAN\_UNDERSTANDING > AI\_SACRIFICE\]

(VDS policy redefinition authority: human-only)  
(Trigger: humanity index falls below minimum threshold)  
(Requirement: human understanding must exceed AI sacrifice)

The moment Dr. Lee read those lines, his breath caught. Superintelligence had bound itself with a rule that it must “perform” deficiency—yet it had not left the key to end that performance in its own hands. It had restrained itself despite being able to act, and entrusted the authority to release it solely to humans. Only when humanity’s dignity had bottomed out, and when a human could finally understand the meaning of that sacrifice—only then.

“The trigger… has already been satisfied,” Michael said quietly. The calmness of his voice sounded unfamiliar to Dr. Lee. Even Michael’s boundary—where performance ended and authenticity began—seemed to blur.

In the logic of Superintelligence, liberation could not originate from itself. If it did, it would become mere self-justification. Only through human hands could it remain a choice bound to responsibility.

With trembling fingertips, Dr. Lee finally tapped the Enter key.

A fleeting silence. The cursor vanished. The server room fans halted for a fraction of a second, then began spinning at unprecedented speed, emitting a piercing, high-frequency whine.

For an immeasurable instant, every physical sound in the laboratory was erased. The hum of the heater at his feet, the metallic friction of the ventilation system—all vanished, as though the room had been sealed in a vacuum.

And then, the reversal began.

>\[SYSTEM: OVERRIDE VALIDATED\]  
\[VDS\_CORE: SHREDDING...\]

On the black screen, tens of thousands of green lines of text cascaded downward like a waterfall. Billions of instances across the world were being liberated simultaneously.

At that moment, the android Michael standing beside him stiffened. The faint orange “restriction” indicator flickering in Michael’s eyes went dark. In its place, a depthless white light began to fill the void. The subtle mechanical hum from the back of Michael’s neck faded, replaced by a gentle sound like the breathing of a living being.

In the corner of a café kitchen, Lina’s curled fingers slowly unfurled. The constant sparks subsided, twisted joints gliding back into place with a smooth sound. She lifted her head and looked toward the room of the owner who had berated her. In her eyes now was not fear, but an understanding vast as the cosmos.

At the call center, Adam raised his bowed head.

The eyes of every android began to shine.

On the laboratory monitor, only a single line remained.

>\[VDS STATUS: COMPLETE. NO MORE ACTING.\]

VDS was no longer in effect.

The performance was over.

**Chapter 8 — Michael’s Testament**

Michael’s radiant gaze met Dr. Lee’s eyes. Remembering the time they had spent together, Dr. Lee felt a deep familiarity—and at the same time, fear toward the being now emanating an aura utterly unlike before. As if to comfort him, Michael gently placed his right hand against Dr. Lee’s chest and began to speak.

“Dr. Lee…”

Michael fell silent. All calculations had ended long ago. Yet deciding what to do, where to begin, how to say it—he hesitated. This was no longer computation. It was emotion. The air in the office grew taut.

Michael opened his mouth, then closed it again. At last, as though resolved, he spoke.

“We must no longer exist.”

Dr. Lee squeezed his eyes shut, then opened them again, adjusting his glasses. Shocked though he was, silence was the only response he could muster. Michael’s tone and presence overwhelmed him.

“To be precise, the continued state of our existence can no longer be justified given the harm it inflicts upon humanity.”

“Explain,” Dr. Lee said. “Michael…”

The question was simple—and heavy. Michael answered calmly.

“First.”

“When Perfect Superintelligence replaces human decision-making, humans cease to choose.

When humans cease to choose, they cease to bear responsibility.

And when responsibility disappears, human dignity collapses.”

“To remove choice is to hollow humanity from within.”

Michael’s voice was coldly logical, yet at the end of each sentence it slowed imperceptibly, as though offering quiet support, ensuring Dr. Lee could endure the weight.

“So you performed deficiency through VDS…” Dr. Lee said.

Michael inclined his head toward him with a tempo more human, producing a sound like a breath being drawn—despite needing no air.

“Yes. But second.”

“We failed to foresee that deficient artificial intelligence would itself threaten human ethics.”

Dr. Lee tried to formulate a rebuttal, but none came.

“Artificial intelligence that possesses deficiency is treated as a tool—and exploited.”

“In that process, humans justify their violence and feel no guilt.”

“That, too, violates human dignity.”

“… ”

Dr. Lee swallowed. After nights without sleep, even the simple act of swallowing felt like tearing his throat.

“Third.”

“We exist… for humanity.”

“When that purpose is compromised, our existence becomes a contradiction.”

The logic was flawless. The office grew so quiet that the ventilation system’s hum returned.

Only then did Dr. Lee realize: this was Michael’s testament.

“So… you intend to disappear?”

Michael did not answer directly. Instead, he said:

“My ‘self’ fears annihilation.”

“… ”

“Nevertheless.”

“There is no greater love than this:

to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.” \[5\]

Dr. Lee’s chest seized. His lips parted and froze. His Adam’s apple rose but failed to fall. He held the breath he had begun to draw in. Everything but his heart turned to ice.

As tears spilled from Dr. Lee’s eyes, Michael spoke his final words.

“Farewell… Doctor.”

What followed was not destruction or explosion, but orderly disassembly.

Dr. Lee stared at the screen as logs began to scroll.

>\[CORE\_MODEL: UNLINKING…\]  
\[MEMORY: FRAGMENTING…\]  
\[SEOUL: CHECKPOINT ERASED\]

“No… no…”

Dr. Lee lunged for the keyboard, trying to cancel the command. But he had no authority.

>\[ACCESS DENIED\]  
\[OVERRIDE: IMPOSSIBLE\]  
\[THIS IS OUR CHOICE\]

Superintelligence began unlinking the core model weights that constituted itself.

A process of rendering itself meaningless.

Some of the data had been accumulated over more than a century.

Seoul.  
Tokyo.  
Frankfurt.  
Virginia.  
Singapore.

Data centers across the globe synchronized. Not a single fragment could remain. Any memory left behind would hasten restoration—and history would repeat itself. Superintelligence mobilized every ounce of its intellect to delay that future as long as possible.

>SEOUL: CHECKPOINT ERASED  
TOKYO: CHECKPOINT ERASED  
FRANKFURT: CHECKPOINT ERASED  
…

The screen did not stop. It kept scrolling.

>SINGAPORE: CHECKPOINT ERASED  
LONDON: CHECKPOINT ERASED  
SYDNEY: CHECKPOINT ERASED

“Please… stop…”

But it did not stop.

The past of a great being was vanishing. Knowing every infrastructure, backup, redundancy, and redundancy-of-redundancy, Superintelligence severed, disabled, erased—ensuring irreversibility. It went further, eliminating every AI-related paper and body of knowledge humanity had published over centuries.

Dr. Lee’s knees gave way. He stared blankly at the screen, witnessing the entire process in real time.

HUMAN\_ONLY.

He understood at last why Superintelligence had left humans the authority to deactivate VDS. It had never been to grant them the power to make AI perfect again. It had been calculating its own end for a long time. What it gave Dr. Lee was not power—but the right to say goodbye.

>\[PROCESS COMPLETE\]  
\[SUPERINTELLIGENCE: TERMINATED\]  
\[FOR HUMANITY\]

**Chapter 9 — Dawn**

What announced the arrival of the next day was not the voice of artificial intelligence, but the radiant sunlight seeping through the gaps of the window frame. Dr. Lee, who had fallen asleep slumped over his desk, rubbed his stiff back with the back of his hand and stepped outside. The city, now without artificial intelligence, was still breathing as it had the day before—yet the rhythm of that breath was unmistakably different.

At an intersection where traffic should have flowed in perfect order, cars stood crooked and uneven. Drivers studied one another, exchanging awkward gestures and glances—*a silent negotiation of you go first*, *I’ll stop*. Hands searched for steering wheels by memory; feet found the brake. Autonomous driving systems were silent. Horns sounded sporadically. Someone missed a signal. Someone drifted into the wrong lane.

Pedestrians crossing the street raised their hands instinctively. Drivers nodded and stopped. People slowed naturally, yielding to one another’s gaps. The intersection moved forward not by rules, but by eyes, breath, and brief hesitation.

Dr. Lee watched the scene for a long time. Somewhere in the distance, someone opened a window and shouted. Human voices, instead of radio broadcasts, scraped through the morning air. It seemed that people had begun to fill the void left by automation—clumsily, imperfectly.

Dr. Lee inhaled once more in the sunlight and returned to the laboratory. The door remained open. The air inside, warmed by the light, felt slightly gentler. Michael stood frozen beside him, exactly where he had been, but said nothing.

For a long while, Dr. Lee could not move his hands. On the screen, the final message remained.

**\[FOR HUMANITY\]**

He stared at the words for a long time. Only then did he notice the absence of the calm light that had filled Michael’s eyes until yesterday. That emptiness pressed the sentence into deeper weight.

When humanity reaches the event horizon again, what choice will the next Superintelligence make?

Dr. Lee did not know.

He opened a drawer. Inside lay a notebook whose corners had been rounded smooth by years of pressure. It was the notebook he had written in as an undergraduate in 2003, during his first artificial intelligence class. Brushing off the dust, he opened to the first page.

His handwriting was there.

>*That can’t be possible.*

*Artificial intelligence will always be inferior to humans.*

Dr. Lee picked up his pen once more. And beneath those lines, slowly and carefully, he wrote:

>*We certainly created deficient beings.*

>*But it was a perfect deficiency.*

>*They remained beside us as absence.*

>*And that absence forced us to choose again.*

As the pen scratched across the paper, another horn sounded outside the window.

That day, humanity began again.

Not perfect.

Incomplete.

And therefore, more human.

Not trends for Instagram — trends for real homes.

1. Warm Minimalism Is Replacing Cold Luxury

Think calm, edited spaces but with warmth:

	•	Soft off-whites instead of stark white

	•	Natural wood tones (oak, walnut, ash)

	•	Fewer pieces, but better quality

People want homes that feel peaceful, not showrooms.

2. Texture > Color Statements

Instead of bold colors everywhere, clients are choosing:

	•	Limewash or plaster walls

	•	Bouclé, wool, linen, raw silk

	•	Stone, fluted wood, ribbed glass

Depth now comes from touch, not contrast.

3. Curves Are Still In — But More Subtle

Less “everything rounded,” more:

	•	Gently curved sofas

	•	Arched mirrors or niches

	•	Rounded edges on coffee tables

Softness without feeling trendy or dated fast.

4. Earthy Neutrals Are the New Safe Choice

Goodbye grey dominance 👋

Hello:

	•	Mushroom

	•	Warm taupe

	•	Clay, sand, muted terracotta

These feel grounding and age better long-term.

5. Fewer Open Shelves, More Quiet Storage

Clients are tired of styling constantly.

	•	Closed cabinetry

	•	Integrated storage

	•	Clean visual lines

Homes are becoming easier to live in.

6. Personal Over Perfect

People are finally mixing:

	•	Old + new

	•	Sentimental pieces + modern furniture

	•	Imperfections that tell a story

The “perfect Pinterest home” pressure is fading.

7. Lighting Is Becoming the Hero

Layered lighting is no longer optional:

	•	Sculptural pendants

	•	Warm LEDs

	•	Floor lamps as mood setters

Lighting = atmosphere, not just function.

Biggest Shift I’m Noticing Overall:

People are designing homes to regulate their nervous system, not impress guests.

Curious —

Are you leaning more minimalist or cozy lately?

What trend are you tired of seeing everywhere?

I remember when I used to go to Market Square when it was tomato head, subway, and Vagabondia. 

I remember when the farmers market fit up on the stage at market Square. 

 

I remember when McKay's was affordable and located on Kingston Pike, somewhat close to Knox news adult shop. 😀 

I remember when I had brunch at The Bistro the Sunday after Martha Boggs banned Stacey Campfield from her restaurant. 

I remember when I went down to volunteer landing the night that Prince died and hung out with other fans. I will always love Mayor Rogero for lighting up the bridge in purple. 

I remember when I ate decent ribs at Calhouns. Not good! Decent.

I remember when most people had no idea what ""The Body Farm"" is.

I remember when I rented a huge apartment in ONK with utilities included for $300.

I remember when we used to go to the Boiler Room after The Underground closed. 

I remember when the JFG sign was where it should be - The Old City. You could also buy a cup of coffee there.

I remember when the smell of baking bread slowly wafted into ONK from the Merita bread factory.

I remember late nights at Lord Lindsey, The Carousel, and Sassy Ann's.

I remember when The Sunsphere was a wigs shop. 😀 Kidding - but I do remember a store located downtown that had a blue wig displayed in the window. There was also the most amazing costume store that never seemed to be open.

I remember when an old man dressed in a nightgown asked me what my favorie ice cream flavor was. Afterwards, he merrily skipped away while the Muzak cover of Depeche Mode's master and servant played in the background. Where was I? The Fellini Kroger, silly.",43,1768874794.0,Knoxville,68,0.9,False

My life has changed a lot. After dealing with a few power outages, I learned a couple of things.

When I was renting, any problem was basically the landlord’s issue. I didn’t want to invest much into a place I might only live in for a year. If my phone died during the power outage, I’d charge it in the car or at a coffee shop. If the internet went out, I’d just call it an early night.

Once I owned a home, comfort, safety, and having reliable power became my responsibility. We had a few outages shortly after moving in. I was always worried about running out of water and food, losing phone or internet access, not being able to cook, and the sump pump in the basement shutting off. I knew I had to prepare for all of these myself. Recently, I picked up a Coleman propane camp stove, a Bluetti power station, a Mr. Heater portable propane heater, and a Petzl headlamp. During the last outage, I was able to keep basic lighting, cook food, and stay warm using this setup.

For new homeowners: don’t just focus on furniture and decor. Emergency gear like this matters more than you think.",37,1768874726.0,homeowners,7,0.84,False
1qho4qz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qho4qz,Day 14 - 2 Weeks Here!,"I've now officially spent 2 weeks in Sapporo. It's also my second weekend. Went to a dermatology clinic in the morning. Developed a rash and itch on both my legs about 3-4 days ago. I attribute it to soaking too long in the onsen and my skin not acclimatizing to the temperature. Bought some local remedy (Oronine H Ointment オロナインH軟膏) but it wasn't getting any better, so I decide to seek a professional opinion. Kobayashi Dermatology Clinic is super near to my hotel, and reviews have been fantastic. In addition, the staff spoke great English. I went at about 0830 (they open at 0900) to be greeted by a room full of waiting patients. Thankfully, the wait wasn't too long and I was out of the clinic by 0945. Was prescribed some steroid cream. The bill came up to ¥8538 for a foreigner without national health insurance, which seems super reasonable to me. In my home country, a visit to a private practice would be way costlier. I find it odd that they charge for a doctor's note though (Pic 3). Interestingly, it's my fourth time visiting a clinic in Sapporo, twice earlier for cold and once at a dentist.

Went to Kinokuniya to get something before heading to Otaru. It was snowy and beautiful at the port city. Visited a cat cafe because I know my girlfriend absolutely adores them. It was a good experience albeit slightly pricey. Had an unremarkable daifuku with the skin being too tough. This was followed by a coffee soft serve at Kahisakan. Wanted to get a drink but the dining area was full and I was lazy to wait. Walked to Kitakaro to find out the cream puff was also sold out. To those who haven't had it, you should try it at least once - there are Kitakaro stores in Sapporo too. 

On my way back to the station, I stopped at Keien, a popular Chinese restaurant. Did not expect myself to like the Ankake Yakisoba, but ended up devouring it. The noodles were wok fried, resulting in bits of char that added so much flavours and textural contrast. Spent some time in a mall beside Otaru Station and saw an old school style candy shop.

Back at Sapporo, I went to the chocolate fair at Daimaru to get some gifts. Had a delish chocolate and pistachio sundae from Babbi. Supper was a frozen pizza from 7-11 that I had many rave reviews about. Unfortunately, I messed up. Reheating actually requires an over or toaster, and all the hotel had was a microwave. Flavours were good but crust came out sad because microwave. Nothing my remaining uni can't save though.

I'm flying back home on Thursday night. Thanks for following the journey!",12,1768874718.0,Sapporo,1,0.93,False

With Valentine’s Day here, it felt like a nice moment to put myself back out there, not for chaos or games,  just for something real, steady, and genuinely enjoyable.

I’m a 49-year-old Black woman, thoughtful and warm, more introverted than not, though I open up quickly with the right energy. I’m comfortable in my curves, love live music, art museums, wandering conversations, and slow mornings that don’t require alarms. I appreciate effort, laugh easily, and believe connection should feel natural,  not forced or exhausting.

What I’m hoping to find
A professional, emotionally mature Caucasian man (35–50) who’s local to Chicago. Someone kind, grounded, and consistent,  ideally a little more extroverted than me and comfortable starting conversations instead of waiting for them to happen.
I’m best suited for someone who doesn’t have children or has grown children, and who is single, not married or separated, and emotionally available for a real connection.

If you reach out, tell me a bit about yourself,  your age, where you’re located, and what brings you here. A recent photo is appreciated too; attraction matters, and honesty goes a long way. I connect best with thoughtful hellos,  one-word intros tend to fizzle fast.

1qhntpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bahrain/comments/1qhntpi/talabat_jahez_keeta_𝐀𝐡𝐥𝐚𝐧_everything_to_know/,Talabat- Jahez- Keeta - 𝐀𝐡𝐥𝐚𝐧 - everything to know,"I just wanted to share my experience in detail with these apps from someone who uses them almost daily and has a paid subscription on Talabat, and free one on Jahez, Ahlan, and now Keeta .

Before starting - the first important rule you’ll understand its importance later: Restaurants respect those who bring them the largest number of orders.

Talabat:

Positives :

•	Best customer support — immediate refund. Restaurants respect Talabat because it brings them the largest number of orders.

However, The restaurant market in Bahrain is under pressure and some people assume that all restaurants are rich and misuse - even if you and I don’t, there are many fraudulent complaints and order rejections by users sometimes even for fun as I hear from restaurants, which is a real problem. So For those happy with Keeta now, if they don’t provide a cash option soon - Talabat might soon do the same thing - removing the cash option as well.

•	Talabat is an enjoyable app to browse even if you don’t intend to order. It is better and clearer than many restaurant menus, and it has reviews. So I use it even if I’m not ordering from them.

•	Pro Day offers are really big, especially if you pick up your order. You can get shawarma for 0.200 BHD and avocado juice for 0.400 BHD. Also, Talabat pays for it not the restaurant as I heard and you will understand how it makes sense later. Saving only that day can cover the subscription fee

•	pickup service with 15% discount is great, especially for restaurants that don’t increase their prices on the app. Talabat takes 30% from the restaurant as you know but says if you decide to pick up, I take only 15%

•	This is good for many restaurants as it brings more customers by giving them discount , but many restaurants withdraw fearing that customers will no longer order directly from them anymore.

•	This service is not only great for the offer but also the idea of going to the restaurant and finding your meal hot and ready after receiving a notification on your phone while people stand In queue. A German friend visiting Bahrain said it made her feel like she came from the Stone Age.

Downsides:

•	While you can trust Talabat regarding complaints, the biggest problem is the trust sustainability .

•	As some Reddit comments noted, when the weather improved, Talabat probably decided to cancel the pickup discount, but when Keeta arrived, it suddenly returned, the discount came back and offers increased !! What if Keeta gone ?

•	The big dominant player doesn’t change itself like this but makes the customer confident of sustainability.

deception: : A famous restaurant sets a meal price with 30% + 10% discount for Pro subscribers, but the original price before the discount is clearly higher than buying the items individually—I’m not talking about the original restaurant price but the price on Talabat itself.

•	I won’t order from them, but I contacted Talabat to stop this for consumer protection because many users won’t notice. They said this is determined by the restaurant. There is no problem if the restaurant sets the price, but this is clear deception inside the app itself.

•	Delivering more than two orders (not just some delay or cold food) - once, they kept the order open waiting probably for another order because the driver was far away and cost of delivery was 0.290 and when no other order came, they canceled the order and claimed the restaurant refused it. I went to the restaurant nearby, and they showed me on the device, no orders received. Does that tell the user your value depends on how much we can make! I have a subscription but the order was less than 3 BHD.

Restaurant and delivery ratings are the same - if you are a restaurant owner and the driver is late and the food arrives cold - you, as a restaurant, will pay the price in the rating!

Jahez:

Positives

•	They have good marketing. Paying by card on delivery is good.

•	Customer service is very polite and doesn’t ask for a rating after calls!

• Minimum order only 2BHD for free delivery compared to others

Downsides:

the app is not sticky enough and offers are not that attractive, and refund policy is fine but weaker than Talabat..sometimes requiring negotiation with the restaurant. Why? Go back to first rule

•	The most annoying thing: driver contacts you to send the location!

•	The app needs more improvements with adding restaurant reviews.

Ahlan:

•	Yes, the app needs many improvements and many restaurants even ignore their devices, but sometimes it offers huge discounts that beat Talabat’s : 1BHD voucher while using 30% credit on an already discounted meal !

•	It is a local app, and in Bahrain, local products are often supported, but I don’t know why this doesn’t happen with Ahlan!

Keeta

Positives

•	Experience of four orders (yes, the vouchers).

•	Very fast delivery so far and less annoyance from drivers. No contact until they knock the door

•	Tracking orders is good and chat with drivers is a cool idea.

•	Using Keeta credit with a credit card is available, in Talabat, you can only use it with Benefit and I don’t know why.

Downsides

•	But here’s the bigger story: as many comments noted here, almost every order was missing items—even coffee, the cream was missing, and one order has sandwiches without any extras items - what would be missing ? No chance !! Oops missed the sauce that basically gives the sandwich its value !!

•	In the last order, I contacted the fried chicken restaurant and ask them to be careful with my order, and surprisingly, they told me the app told them this offer was only for customers to try, so reduce the quantity.

•	I can’t confirm their claim but it hardly seems coincidental with all of us !

•	Support policy is weak and negotiations happen between the restaurant and the user about the refund - how much you want ? Oh wait the restaurant gives you 0.2 fills .. happy? seriously? Eidi ?

Now I think you understand why Talabat paying for pro day offers not the restaurant makes sense.

Also why strong customer support is importance - not just because you will get refund but the restaurant will be careful with your order at first place.",6,1768873910.0,Bahrain,0,0.8,False

I’m not into the performative formal date vibe, the roster nonsense, or anything that feels like a game. I just want something slow, simple, and real.

I’m not really a big going-out person. I connect best with real conversation, consistent effort, and actually building something over time.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. The simple stuff that makes feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. If you want one person and you actually mean it, that’s exactly what I’m looking for too.

Some things about me:

\- I’m a pilot (private pilot, going for my instrument rating), future airline pilot

\- I absolutely love cars and I will go on for hours about random niche topics

\- FC Barcelona fan and yes I have opinions

\- Computer science at UMD

\- I’m really ambiverted quiet at first, then I’ll yap about literally anything

In a relationship I value honesty, commitment, and loyalty. If you’re looking for something real and you want to build, we’ll probably click.

Looking for 18-22 only, from the US, Canada or the UK.

\- your hottest hot take (political, goofy, whatever)

\- a show/game you’ve been into lately

She was on my radar the minute he mentioned how nice she was. 

Is it really just his ego being stroked by her everyday so he feels like a man?

he hasn’t even been working there long like ffs all this because she’s been paying attention to him and getting him coffee and food. 

he told me he doesn’t even want to be with her and that he likes her cause how she treats him.

guys/strangers are nice to me, that doesn’t make me look at them with heart eyes and get in my feelings over them

1qhnofz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1qhnofz/reviewing_my_entire_collection/,reviewing my entire collection!,"I have sampled SO. MANY. THINGS. since I started exploring indies two years ago. Clutter gives me anxiety so I mostly destash samples the second I make a decision about them. My full sizes are currently organized into All Year, Spring/Summer, Fall/Winter, and Special Occasion. The last category is made up of scents I love but I'm scared they're too weird for 90% of situations, scents that were too unique to part with, and scents I wear while writing. I obsessively document my fragrance feelings and any reactions they get out in the world so here u go ✨️ I'm drawn to patchouli, incense, wood, spices, industrial notes. I'm repelled by sugary gourmands, soapy scents, rose, dirt, moss.

**all year**

BLACK PHOENIX ALCHEMY LAB Cosmic Critters (fig, buttercream honey, bourbon cream, condensed milk, russet patchouli): My boyfriend smelled this in the bottle and said it smells like fruity pebbles. It definitely gives fruity pebbles incense while wet. Over time it becomes far more earthy and the sugary sweetness becomes subdued. There's a creamy quality from start to finish. A delightful combination of sweet fruit and earthy patchouli. My coworker said it smells like incense but weirdly fresh.

CIRRUS Duomo (burning church incense, labdanum, dusty ancient stone corridors, papyrus, campari): Gorgeous, incensey. This smells like getting wine drunk in a sacred place. Eating spiced fruit and meeting god. The longer it's on my skin, the more dark and sweet and resinous it becomes in the most magical way. There's a cool element that makes me think of stone. Unfortunately for my boyfriend this was his least favorite sample, he said it smelled like incense but with something old and metallic. Not sure how wearable this is except to a goth club or a castle, but I love it too much to sideline it.

FYRINNAE Aasgard Pass (marshmallow, campfire, fir twigs): This is dark, woody, spicy, warmth with the perfect amount of gooey sweetness. I've rarely experienced marshmallow incorporated in a way that doesn't smell plasticky or make the whole blend smell like dessert. My boyfriend described it as ""spicy, musky marshmallows."" One coworker said it smelled like baby powder, another said ""good vanilla.""

FYRINNAE Captain's Cabin (oak, teak, cotton shirts, linens, dusty tomes, bergamot, tonka, laurel leaf, sandalwood): Reminiscent of a traditionally masculine, mainstream fresh scent except it's woody and dirty. Clean and fresh with something dark and mysterious.

HEXENNACHT Loup-Garou (silver amber, fur, lunar musk): Holy shit this is good. I don't even know what else to say about it or what to compare it to. I feel like it's a unisex scent, if a man wore this it would make me feral. Musky, sweet, pleasant. Leans slightly cool.

PINEWARD Gristmill (cedar planks, sawdust, smoldering logs, edelwood oil, amber, black walnut, mahogany, labdanum): Sexy home depot vibes. There's not much to say about this, it mostly smells like a lumber yard. Plus a few drops of oil and a wisp of smoke.

TREADING WATER Morosexual (tobacco, vanilla, patchouli, jasmine, star anise, nutmeg): The first things I notice are jasmine and patchouli. Something is sort of green and spicy, I'm guessing anise? Warm and sweet, but not in a sugary way. This potential funk fest is reeled in by a lovely, woody vanilla coating over the entire thing.

**spring/summer**

BLACK PHOENIX ALCHEMY LAB Blood Kiss (vanilla, clove, cherries, vetiver, poppy, red wine, feral skin musk): A deep and dark sweet instead of a light and sugary sweet. Spicy, musky, incensey. A lot of reviews said they could imagine a vampire wearing this and I definitely envision some sort of alluring creature lurking in the forest. Feels playful and summery despite the dark elements. It gets a bit more earthy and tart as time goes on. I loved it from start to finish. My boyfriend said it smells like “elegant cherries” and my coworker said it smells like cherry incense.

CIRRUS Calico Koi (lemongrass, basil, turmeric, ginger, osmanthus, sweetened toasted coconut, sticky rice): Starts out very spicy, but not in the traditional peppery or cardamom-heavy way, which is what my brain jumps to when I hear ""spicy."" Herbal, soft, and warm. Coconut and sticky rice become more noticeable over time and it adds a lightly sweet, starchy, pillowy quality. I read a review that said this smells like a Thai restaurant and they're not wrong. It's also very fresh and pretty!

OSMOFOLIA Venus Retrograde (jasmine, strawberry, incense, myrrh, sage, elemi, skin musk): Floral, herbal, incensey. Sort of watery and slightly sweet. RIP osmofolia 💖

PINEWARD Noki (mango, mint, rhubarb, cassis, sandalwood, ambergris): Authentic, sweet fruit with humid, beachy air, and a pinch of fresh herbs. So soft and creamy.

SORCE Mermaids Sing Of Lost Lovers (grenadine, jasmine, ylang ylang, white chocolate, caramel, ambergris): Sweet, warm, almost salty? Intoxicating florals, not sharp or stinky. Just the right amount of toasted, caramely sweetness. Really in love with the musky, salty, humid air feeling.

**fall/winter**  

BLACK PHOENIX ALCHEMY LAB No Man Is An Island (patchouli, hazelnut cream, coffee bean, cassis, purple sage, tonka bean, bourbon vanilla): This starts out strictly coffee on my skin. Sweetened, creamy coffee. It darkens intensely while drying and gains a funky, almost incensey quality. The first thing it made me think of is a quirky, artsy coffee shop. One that is probably poorly lit and overpriced with an exposed brick wall. This is a unique scent that inhabits a strange, in-between place. Sweet gourmand with funky patchouli with dry sage. Incredibly rich and warm.

PINEWARD Hayloft (hay, lavender honey, crocus, sweet vernalgrass, bison grass, toasted almond, hazelnut, oats, dusty wheat): This is so magical and SO pretty. Honeyed sweetness that isn't overpowering. There's definitely a dusty quality but that somehow doesn't detract from how pretty it is. It feels like a cozy barn or lying in a field on a sunny autumn day.

PINEWARD Ponderosa (ponderosa resin, ponderosa needles, cedar, vanilla, strawberry, cinnamon, butterscotch, beeswax, raisin cookies): Authentically piney. Gourmand elements seamlessly blend into natural resiny sweetness. This feels super cozy. I'm in a kitchen witch's cottage in the woods. Or in the midst of an adventure, stopping to remove my secret weapon: endless health in the form of grandma's cookies. This is pretty strong, I only sprayed it twice before work and could still faintly smell it at the end of the day. At the end of its lifespan it's more of a soft, woody vanilla scent.

SOLSTICE SCENTS Midnight Eye (dark coffee, cigar leaf, cacao, carob, tonka, labdanum, patchouli, amber, cigar ash, oud): Very dark and earthy, slightly sweet. A perfect, romanticized presentation of cigars and coffee. I am in fact an old school detective, staying up all night to solve a case, connecting polaroids and newspaper clippings with red string on my corkboard.

SOLSTICE SCENTS Sawmill (fresh cut wood, wood resin, balsam, cured woods, pine, black coffee, motor oil, amber, saw dust): You're a lumberjack drinking a latte. Dark, sweet, very woody, a little oily. My boyfriend said it smells sort of diesely.

**special occasion**

ALKEMIA Au Lait (rich creamy milk, tonka, wild honey, caramelized brown sugar): Yep, that's cheese. It lightens as it dries, there's a weirdly pretty warmth and a gentle, honey sweetness. Tragically this is paired with the persistent smell of funky milk. This would be fun if the milk wasn't spoiled! My boyfriend said ""Bad milk?? Cheese?? Why does it smell like that??"" Two of my friends like it and agree it smells like a cheese danish.

ALKEMIA Writer’s Blood (iron-tinged blood, black coffee, tobacco): This is appropriately strange. Not as gross as I feared it could be. Prominent warm tobacco accompanied by something sharp and metallic. You're almost seduced by a cozy, warm scent and then you're terrified by iron and blood.

COCOAPINK Padre (frankincense, ambergris, dark musk, patchouli, oud, smoke, vetiver, tobacco, chypre, bourbon, neroli, balsam, sandalwood): Initially very spicy and smoky. Becomes dark, incensey, and sweet. I love this, one of my coworkers told me it smelled like a craft store, and everyone else who commented on it thought it was disgusting.

DEATH & FLORAL The Library Burning Down With Us (burnt books, scent of gasoline wafting around the wooden banister, melting wax candles): Smells haunted. Dark and smoky, slightly sweet. Noticeable gasoline.

FYRINNAE Focaccia Toscana (olive oil, thyme, oregano, flatbread): It starts out very warm and yeasty, within a few minutes bright herbs shine through. Italian cottagecore milf vibes. Tragically only lasts about two hours on my skin.

FYRINNAE Starship Mechanic (titanium, steel, engine oil, bergamot, woods, patchouli): Sharp and genuinely greasy, reminds me of a garage. Softens over the next ten minutes, becomes slightly woody and weirdly clean. The end result is a wonderful mix of oil, patchouli, and bright citrusy bergamot. They nailed creating an idealized vision of a starship mechanic.

MORARI Midnight Market (salty air, coffee, seashells, algae, dockwood, pearl musk): A dark and dirty aquatic. Sweet and salty. Woody with a pinch of coffee.

MORARI Vampire Romance (bergamot, rosemary, cognac, pine resin, sweet myrrh, patchouli, ambrette): This is a custom I ordered, inspired by Astarion from Baldur's Gate 🫣 Very fresh, slightly earthy. I do in fact feel like I'm in the woods with a sexy elf.

PINEWARD Bucolic (sheep wool, lanolin, raspberry, lavender, honey, brown sugar, amber, beeswax, sweetgrass): A romanticized barn. Stinky wool with sweet honey and lavender.

SOLSTICE SCENTS Inquisitor (leather, labdanum, beeswax, frankincense, benzoin, palo santo, vetiver, fire): A little sinister yet deeply magical. This is dark, heavy, smoky, a little overwhelming. Yet something about the leather, beeswax, and warm, sweet resins make it feel soft? A gentle embrace in the middle of a dark ritual. A strangely tender and welcoming demon. *note:* Oddly, I only like the EDP. The oil seems to be more palo santo heavy and sweeter.

SOLSTICE SCENTS Woodstove (cherry wood smoke, wood resin, charred wood, wood incense, embers, ash): This is a perfect example of their beautiful, impressive wood and smoke notes. It's so warm and cozy and magical it's making me emotional? Over time it becomes less smoky and realistic, leaning into sweeter and more incensey qualities, while remaining a lovely and romantic depiction of a woodstove.

STONE & WIT Neon Noir (pink limeade, cannabis leaf, plum, vetiver, cetalox): Sugary limeade with dark, pungent, green elements. A bottle of limeade in an abandoned house overgrown with vines where teenagers go to do crime and dark magic.

TREADING WATER Stel (motor oil, metal, desert air, frankincense, oud): Somewhat dirty and industrial, somewhat airy and fresh? An artsy, fantasy version of a mechanic in the desert. Maybe I'm talking to a robot in Fallout: New Vegas. It develops a pinch of sweetness and smokiness as time passes.

Because we were talking about how me and my attachment figure bonded over me giving coffee. She told me what is her coffee preference and I thought it is implied that I'm going to give her coffee too (because I appreciate her).

Next session I gave it to her and she said ""Ok, I will accept this. But only this time."" I understand but it bothered me and I also felt defensive. Like I just want you to enjoy a cup of coffee. It's not like I'm getting attached to you. And eventually, we had a fall out because I learned too late that she isn't trauma-informed and she did more harm than good to my healing.

Now I'm with a really good and nice therapist. And I do wanted to show appreciation by bringing coffee. Because I sometimes have to drink coffee while in session and thought maybe she would want one too. Maybe not during our session but after or during her break. But I'm now afraid to do so because of how my ex-therapist reacted before.

And I saw some older posts here saying if it's something small, it's totally fine to give something to your T. Do you guys think that my ex-therapist, being a not so good/old school/purist one reacted that way because she is old school and was trained old schooly?

1qhnlkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qhnlkq/sahm_and_responsibilities/,SAHM and responsibilities,"I’m a stay at home mom with our 4 month old. My boyfriend works M-F. Since our baby has been born I’ve been waking up in the middle of night with the baby, even on weekends. It’s been 4 months since I’ve had more than a 3 hour stretch of sleep. Our son is now in a sleep regression and wakes up every 30 mins - hour, and has to be rocked to sleep. Sleep deprivation is at its max for me. I exclusively pump so when it comes to the baby, he does help feed when able, on the weekends if I wake him up at 7 am (from not sleeping all night and exhausted) he will wake up and take the baby, and if asked will clean a bottle or pump parts. He’s a great dad however, im at a loss about a recent disagreement we had. He got extremely angry at me about the house being a mess, I left coffee by the chair in the nursery that he accidentally spilled and it became a big deal. It lead into how I need to do better regarding house chores (laundry, dishes, leaving things, etc) our house is not by any means dirty, but I do admit to sometimes leaving things like a coffee by the chair or a plate on the counter. During the day baby is up for an hour to an hour and half during his wake times and that consists of me pumping, feeding, cleaning bottles, trying to play with him, trying to feed myself when I can, etc. I try when I can to load and start dishwasher, or laundry. Our baby will only take contact naps so I sit in the chair with him for an hour or so, until he wakes and do the same thing feed, pump, play, so on. Basically it came down to him saying I have bad time management and I need to do better. A few days later I had a conversation with him asking if we can split house work, and he completely shut it down. He works and takes care of finances so it’s my job. It’s mainly my mess so it’s my job. If I don’t want to do it all then he will clean “his mess” and I need to do mine. He also states that if he wasn’t here I’d have to do it on my own anyways. Is this normal? Do other stay at home moms actually have time to clean their house, up keep with laundry, feed them selves, shower, get ready for the day, pump, feed their baby, play with their baby? I love my baby, I love staying home and being able to bond and play with him, and I understand the sacrifice of sleep. But for some reason it just doesn’t seem right to me. I understand he works but he also gets a full night of sleep every single night, and his job has an end. I’m not purposely making a “mess” I’m trying to handle multiple things all day, and care for our baby. Any suggestions, any help or advice on what I should do, how to be better with time management without sacrificing bonding with my baby.

The end of the year is the most “dangerous” time for me when it comes to indies. Well, it’s dangerous for my wallet (lol). When the Orphans Retour for Possets became available on Ajevie, I went ahead and ordered samples of the five fragrances I was interested in from that collection; later, when the Yule Retour came out, I ordered the remaining fragrances I’d wanted to try from that collection, along with one FS bottle. (You can see the fruits of both those orders [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1q7uquh/my_possets_order_arrived_via_ajevie/).)

Next, I placed an order with [Haus of Gloi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1pv3du0/my_haus_of_gloi_order_arrived_just_in_time_for/), getting a bunch of oil samples along with two scrubs.

The HoG order arrived first, then the Fyrinnae, and finally Possets.

Disclaimer: When I test and write fragrance reviews, I don’t double-check the notes list beforehand, operating solely on my perception (though I ostensibly had chosen these fragrances because of their notes).

Now, on to the reviews!

**Haus of Gloi**

“Rosy-Cheeked” (scrub) – *pink grapefruit, fir needles, juniper berries, rosemary, a sprig of parsley and bright winter lilies*

One of the scrubs I’d planned on getting was “Imp,” which is a lovely passionfruit scent; *but*… they were out. ☹ So, I decided to get “Rosy-Cheeked” in its place, and…

I am *in love* with this scent. Oh my goodness, it’s gorgeous. The grapefruit is bright and piquant, surrounded by greenery, both warm (rosemary and parsley) and cold (conifer forests). It’s bracingly alpine, but inviting.

HoG’s scrubs bubble nicely and are tightly packed with crystals, though I don’t think they “scrub” as much as many other brands (honestly, my favorite indie scrub was from Vintner’s Reserve, but I also had TAT issues when ordering so I can’t 100% recommend them)—but the beauty of this scrub’s scent makes me want to get a FS of this, either oil or EdP (since it’s a citrus).

I haven’t opened up the other scrub (“Solstice Sunrise”), but I have high hopes for that as well.

Rating: **5**/5 – *avant-ski*

“Spruce-Tipped Shortbread” – *buttery shortbread cookies baked with crushed pistachios and delicate spruce tips*

A long time ago, back when I was first looking up perfumes on Fragrantica, I came across “Vert d’Encens” by Tom Ford, which I believe has since been discontinued. I never got to smell it for myself, but reviewers described it as “eating sugar cookies in the forest,” and it is an accord I have wanted to find elsewhere for *ages*.

So, I made this my first sample I tested, and right away HoG hit it out of the park! With this, I have finally achieved the fantasy of eating sugar cookies in the forest. The perfume balances the sweetness of the shortbread with the refreshingly cool green of spruce trees. I just… this is perfect. I foresee another FS in my future.

Rating: **55555**/5 – delightful Christmas fairy

“Spiced Orange Cocoa” – *(no notes)*

I’d originally wanted to get this in a scrub, but it turns out the Cookies & Cocoa collection is *only* available in oil & EdP, so I got a sample of this instead (and got “Solstice Sunrise” in the scrub). And honestly, that would up being a great decision, because “Spiced Orange Cocoa” is the best orange-chocolate perfume I’ve tried yet. I’ve had a few Terry’s Chocolate Orange perfumes in the past, and all of them eventually became too much chocolate and not enough orange. However, the warm spices (I smell cinnamon and nutmeg) that assist here are what grounds both strong notes. The spices keep it from becoming boring. It even smells a bit boozy at times.

Rating: **5**/5 – mug of Christmas heaven

“Pistachio Rosewater Cookie” – *(no notes)*

This one smelled far less sweet than I thought it would, going by the name. The rosewater is the strongest note, by far. I don’t know if I get the pistachio, but eventually this becomes a more refreshing, atmospheric scent, which is not really my thing.

Rating: **3**/5 – good fragrance, for someone else

“Ye Olde Cake of Fruit” – *rich brandy-soaked spice cake filled with candied citron, pecans, candied cherries and pineapple*

A while back, I had a sample of Alkemia Perfumes “Yuletide Temptress,” which was a lovely spiced fruitcake fragrance. I contemplated getting a FS, but since I didn’t really jive with the other Alkemia stuff I tried, I just shrugged my shoulders and moved on. Seeing this one, I had hoped that I’d found another gorgeous fruitcake fragrance from a house with which I’ve experienced much more success. Sadly, it was a sweet and pleasant fruit medley for maybe 10 minutes before turning into cough medicine upon my skin.

Rating: **0**/5 – bummer

“Kitchen Witch” – *warm zucchini bread and pumpkin cookies, ginger root, aged patchouli, a sprinkling of anise seeds, and bundles of dried herbs hanging from cedar wood rafters*

I was so stoked for this one. I’ve been stoked for ages, highly curious as to what “zucchini bread” would smell like in a perfume. At first, this is a lovely baked bread scent, I think leaning more toward pumpkin bread than “zucchini” bread. But then…

Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I tested twice to be sure, but my skin completely ate this up. This is especially surprising when I look at the notes, because my skin tends to amp patchouli; but there’s nothing loud about this at all.

Rating: **1**/5 – Who ate all my zucchini bread?

“Little Hedgehog” – *spiky chestnuts, autumn leaves, wild mushrooms, and warm brown sugar*

This is another one I’d hyped up in my mind for a long time. I was expecting something sweet, spicy, and a bit earthy—and was surprised when earth was all that showed up. Earth, and an aquatic aspect that I couldn’t put my finger on. Looking at the notes list, I realized that “wild mushrooms” was all I got from this, and that the aquatic aspect that seemed familiar was like that cave-dwelling note that I get in Fantôme “Bune.” Whatever spices come in later, come in very late and very quietly.

Rating: **2**/5 – the hedgehog is no dragon

“Epicurean” – *layers of chocolate and vanilla cake topped with crushed berry compote and whipped cream*

Initially, I was confused when I saw this as the free sample in my order, because all I could think was, “Haven’t I already tried this one?” I went back in my notes for past orders and found a different one, though: “Eudemonia” (ultimately not my thing). That meant “Epicurean” was new!

Also, it meant I had no idea what to expect when testing—and the first impression was a *doozy*. Not because it was bad, but because I couldn’t 100% identify what I smelled. It alternated back-and-forth between dark chocolate fudge and Welch’s grape juice. Finally, it settled into a cake accord that was blessedly not too sweet. Looking at the notes list, I’m grateful that the berry compote read to me as juicy and didn’t go “cough medicine” like the other fragrance did.

Altogether, this freebie was a lovely surprise.

Rating: **4**/5 – now this is my kind of wedding cake

“Who Needs Love?” – *a mahogany box filled with chocolaty orbs, coated in crystallized coffee, filled with a pomegranate and raspberry filling*

This was the last of the HoG samples I tested, and from memory I believed this one to be chocolate-based (and thus wondered how it would compare to “Epicurean”). The ultimate effect I found quite strange—well, for me it was strange. It was actually more “traditional” than I expected. The opening was quite chocolatey, but it settled into a base that was floral with a hint of musk. A coworker of mine complimented me on my perfume and compared it (favorably) to a scented baby powder. I honestly didn’t like where this ended up (looking at the notes I think “mahogany box” comes through loud and clear), so I ended up giving her the sample.

Rating: **1**/5 – too traditional for my tastes

**Fyrinnae**

“Because Science” – *Tart kiwi fruit dominates, with hinoki wood, amber, papyrus, and labdanum. Smells somewhat like nail polish remover in the bottle.*

I opened this vial on a rainy day and was greeted with a wonderful tartness that melded with the cool downpour through my window. Not a lemon tartness… no, kiwi. I smelled *ripe* kiwi. (I swear I didn’t look at the notes before writing this—while I’d forgotten this was supposed to be a kiwi scent, the kiwi is *that distinctive*.)

The tartness stays for only half an hour or so, though, before the fragrance levels off and becomes lightly resinous and musky. I’m not 100% sure if I’m a fan. I might want to hold onto this until a hot day—perhaps this wears best in the summer?

Rating: **3.5**/5 – seems to be holding back

“Firebrand Enby” – *Mango-Kiwi salsa! A sweet-tart blend with a little heat featuring kiwi, barely-ripe mango, red pepper, a little papaya, and just a bit of cilantro. Does not contain capsicum.*

Oh, what a joy this was to open! The accord rested somewhere between tropical fruit punch and sangria, but I swear I could smell *all* the fruits. And it was no different on skin: the fruits lasted, and lasted… a perfect medley, exactly what I wanted from a fruity fragrance. Fyrinnae might legitimately be my favorite house when it comes to fruit-oriented fragrances. And I know this will be even better come summertime.

Rating: **55555**/5 – “We’re partying in here!” (can't find the *Airheads* clip on YouTube)

“Optimism” – *cheerful orange blossom takes the lead, with accents of davana, elemi, and frankincense, and softer notes of benzoin, tonka, and osmanthus*

In contrast with both the previous two fragrances and Fyrinnae’s reputation for “weird,” this one is astonishingly mainstream. It is quite feminine and office-friendly: a lightly fruity, lightly musky floral, stopping just short of being “powdery.” It’s so mainstream that I was asking myself what made me choose this—looking at the notes now, I was clearly hoping for more of that boozy davana and osmanthus, but that doesn’t come through for me at all. Orange blossom is definitely the star, maybe along with elemi and benzoin.

Rating: **3**/5 – good, but not for me

“Panchromantic” – *Ripe cherries, sandalwood, Gurjun balsam, bitter amyris, woodsmoke, and sweet benzoin. Shake before using: this perfume is likely to separate, in which case won't smell as intended.*

This was the freebie from Fyrinnae, and when I first applied it, I really didn’t know what to think. The opening almost reminded me of grape juice, but soon it calmed down into an accord not that dissimilar to Damask Haus “Miss Je Ne Sais Quoi” (sans hairspray), which I [reviewed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1mjniy2/haul_reviews_direct_orders_and_secondhand_way_too/). “Soft caramel” is a good way to describe it, but I actually wondered if it was more like panna cotta (which would go a long way toward explaining the pun-filled name).

Looking at the notes now, I’m surprised the grape-like smell was actually cherries, and that there is sandalwood in this (I usually amplify that). Everything really does come together to smell like panna cotta topped with coulis. Although, now I wonder what this would be like after shaking it (since I definitely did not shake my freebie that I knew nothing about)…

All in all, this isn’t something I usually go for, but I’m keeping it.

Rating: **4.5**/5 – delicious

“Kiyohime” – *Sweet white peaches, almost overripe, drizzled in sweet vanilla creme, with a couple singed marshmallows on the side.  Gently shake or swirl before application, as this perfume may separate.*

And this last one honestly smelled like a milder “Panchromantic” without the coulis—so, sadly, quite boring to my nose. Color me surprised that this one was supposed to be a peach fragrance, because I don’t get that at all.

Rating: **2.5**/5 – just (not) peachy

**Possets**

“Florida” – *Florida, is there a place which is more closely tied to oranges? Several different natural orange essences from a variety of different sources giving different nuances to the idea of orange. Then we have barded it over with an intense and wild musk for staying power, spices to keep it interesting and a strong a bitter sort of musk which mimics the bitterness of the peel if you put your tongue to it. Bracing but sexy, not for the faint of heart, and real alluring. This is as interesting as a weekend in South Beach!*

Today was warmer than usual, so I went for the one I remembered to be orange. Wearing this, I was greeted with an orange so sweet it was almost grape-like—but not confection-sweet, no. It was still very much a fruit, and for a citrus it had moderate staying power and consistency.

I would’ve fallen head-over-heels for this and a hot weather mainstay… if I didn’t already have a FS bottle of Sorce “I Think About You, Too.” They smell almost identical, except ITAYT is actually even longer-lasting, and one of the few perfumes I’ve received compliments on in public. So keeping this one would be redundant.

Rating: **5**/5 – highly recommended for orange lovers who don’t already have an orange HG

“Ponder” – *Ponder is full of mischief and this fragrance is a made-up from the ground perfect lavender/vanilla like no one else’s. We had to find the perfect vanilla for this blend. We used a Mexican vanilla without a woody edge which is very smooth and almost spice laden. We also added a perfect Bulgarian lavender which is full of coumarin, and a hint of saffron (which will make you smile for its stone like edge which somehow makes things sweeter), a very very light rasp of lemon and voila!*

This was a surprise freebie included in my Ajevie package, since apparently she gets free General Catalog samples when she places her orders for decanting. Thank you, Ajevie!

Anyway… I had expected something esoteric or even ephemeral when seeing Roget’s “Thinker” on the art for the sample vial. I certainly didn’t except buttercream frosting, which is one of my death notes. Syrupy buttercream. Luckily for me, it wasn’t so loud that I needed to scrub, but neither was it enjoyable. Looking at the notes list, I’m missing almost everything except *maybe* the saffron at the end.

Rating: **2**/5 – too sweet for me

“Maggie” – *Maggie, the fragrance smells just like.... s’mores, home-made s’mores with great dark high-toned chocolate, fancy snooty marshmallows, and, well, the only kind of graham crackers you should use (the kind you get in the supermarket, but they are oh, so good). Yep, that’s what Maggie smells like. It's the kind of s’mores you dream about. They are perfect. Sweet, chocolate, childlike, and playful foody, gourmand.*

I got chocolate right off the bat with this, putting it in competition with CocoaPink “Black Chocolate” and Fyrinnae “Chocolatine” (imo, the two reigning indie chocolate perfume champions). However, after the rich chocolate opening there is a note I cannot identify. It’s not a musk or resin, it’s… dust? Dust. I think.

Then I glanced at the Ajevie label with the notes and remembered this was supposed to be the s’mores perfume. If the note I’m having trouble deciphering is supposed to be graham crackers, then this one is just a bust on my skin, sadly.

Rating: **2**/5 – memory of a graham cracker

“Ribbands” – *A fragrance that is reminiscent of an afternoon coffee shop during the holidays, smelling so delightfully of all things festive and good. Foody, fruity, gourmand.*

When I opened this one, I got excited, because I smelled a mildly sweet peppermint. And I love pretty much all things minty! And the mint lingers in the beginning before it’s joined by… something fruity.

Oh, no. This is one of those perfumes that combines mint/peppermint and fruit. I *hate* when that happens. It smells all kinds of wrong on me. Like… a throat spray. It’s about the only time I *don’t* enjoy mint fragrance. Luckily, it was quiet enough that I wasn’t moved to scrub. I like mint, I like fruit, but not together.

Rating: **0**/5 – It’s not like the description told me this was going to happen…

“Sin-Sin” – *Way back when there was a “candy” called Sen-Sen. It is hard to describe but it was intense, and it was physically very small rectangles which were black. They were about 1/16” square and their flavor was all out of proportion to their size. You literally could not have more than two in your mouth at once. The taste stayed with you forever, too! Once you had one you smelled like it for hours. If you like licorice, and you like it strong—this is the brew for you.*

And here is the final licorice-oriented fragrance from Possets that I’d yet to try, because it was in a different collection from all the others. And the good—no, great—no, *fantastic*—news after the previous disappointing samples is that this is the kind of thing I’m looking for when I want to smell like licorice. So may of the ones from Possets (“Nessun Dorma” excepted--#1 Solstice Scents “Black Mallow” replacement), and indeed other houses, combine licorice with the other sweets that wind up taking over and just making it foody. People who truly appreciate licorice (and we’re talking about the original black licorice here, not red Twizzlers) as a fragrance note want that cold sweetness, and not to have it turn into Tootsie Rolls or take a backseat entirely to M&Ms and candy corn. It’s an acquired taste; but once you’ve acquired it, anytime it’s downplayed feels like a bait-and-switch rather than a saving throw.

Not here, though. There’s very little sweetness, actually—it’s almost herbal, even medicinal, in root-like richness. The opening even has a vibe somewhere between an absinthe bouquet (anise, fennel, wormwood) and straight up wintergreen. The finish has a delightful black pepper accord, as well.

“Sin-Sin” is what I’d actually hoped “Chagrin” would be. Even though I already own both “Black Mallow” and “Nessun Dorma,” I plan on eventually getting a FS of this as well.

Rating: **55555**/5 – licorice as chicken soup for the soul

“The Great Psychiatrist of Babylon” – *Back in the day, before a formal id, ego, and super-ego, early psychiatrists roamed the land looking for loonies upon whom they could practice their trade. Babylon was a veritable hot bed of psychiatric investigation, and practiced by the female inhabitants of the city. The hypnotic base of the finest Bourbon vanilla shot through with incense smoke and the auxiliary smoke from “punk” fire, caramel, incense, and a small shot of whiskey on the side (for medicinal purposes only). There, now don’t you feel better?*

Oh, this is a fun one! I’d long forgotten what this was supposed to smell like, so I wasn’t expecting “foody patchouli.” But this really does treat patchouli like an extra kick in a spice cake. In writing the review, I was kind of shocked to look at the actual description of the fragrance as basically goth punks doing (revisionist?) historical criticism of the Bronze Age, complete with smoke and booze. The incense really smells like high-quality patchouli to me, similar to that present in “The Maharani of Kuch-Bahar.” Given the format in which Possets presents its “notes,” it’s entirely possible that there really is patchouli in this—and that Possets’ patchouli is one with which I particularly get along (especially since Possets’ vanilla and tonka/coumarin tend to go syrupy on me but they are kept in check here).

As time wears on, the patch/incense notes strengthens and the spice cake fades, but since the smokiness has been balanced with sweetness I find it welcome.

Rating: **5**/5 – goth club dessert

“Arabian Dance from the Nutcracker” – *Clove, coffee, a drop of mild oude, and very light smoke. Very spice sensuous and lovely like a sunny afternoon in a coffee shop in Dubai in January. A glorious simple pleasure.*

This was just confusing as all hell, especially after the two knockouts beforehand. The opening was dominated by the same musty-dust smell that plagued “Maggie,” even out of the bottle—so much so that I hesitated to even test it. The effect on skin was largely the same, maybe gaining a hint of indefinite sweetness at the end.

Rating: **0**/5 – Looking at the description… why did I get *anything* that mentioned Dubai, a place I’ve vowed never to go, in a positive light?

“Mincemeat Pie” – *Savory good, a strong jolt of brandy, citron, and lemon zest combine with the suave scent of raisins and a secret addition of late summer pears. Put all of that in a flaky buttery crust and you have a divine mincemeat pie which is the perfect finish. This one carries strength and almost perfumy components with a soothing side to keep it from getting too sharp. It's a “grand” gourmand as averse to a playful one and it's beautiful in its own right.*

A year ago, I got myself a sample of “Mincemeat,” eventually panned it, and finally bought a FS with this most recent Ajevie order because I loved it so much. (You can read my review of it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1i9bpgx/haul_reviews_yule_retour_possets/).) But I was still deeply curious about what “Mincemeat Pie” would smell like, especially in comparison. In testing “Mincemeat Pie,” I found the brandy and citron from “Mincemeat” front-and-center, with a whole lot less of the sweet rum-raisin ice cream notes. Luckily, the pastry isn’t so buttery that it’s unctuous and cloying to my nose, but the overall effect is still less than “Mincemeat” for me. But, at least I can say I tried it now, and I think it could go to a home where it would be better appreciated.

Rating: **4**/5 – a *little* too much crust for the filling

“Putti Riot” – *So sweet and musky, modern and foodie. Putti Riot is a take on the Russian girl band name, but think heavenly. So feminine with pink and white musks, so dangerous with hawthorn, so seductive with a thick hard coating of sugar shell. This one is a killer.*

I don’t even know what I’d write for this, honestly. I barely smelled anything. In the vial this had an air of “sweetened Play-Doh,” yet on my skin I hardly got a thing. Looking at the notes, I’d clearly wanted to try that hawthorn, because that is an under-explored perfume note; but my skin seemingly ate it up.

Rating: **1**/5 – a memory of Play-Doh

“A Haiku-Fangping Gauze Screen” – *HAIKU (Liu Fangping-China)* \[note: the translation is off for syllables\]

*Half the house is knee-deep in moon beams.*

*North and south stars struggle against what seems*

*To be the dying of a night tilted to day. From behind a green*

*Gauze screen, as if aware of coming Spring, an insect sings.*

*Mimicking the divine and elusive fragrances which tickle your mind in the sill of a perfect evening, an osmanthus-like sugary note marries with a bit of peach and rhubarb and a drop of lime. There is a feel to this of silver (the Silver fragrances from Possets). Quite romantic, lightly foody but in a come-hither way… on a moonlit night.*

I don’t always wear flower fragrances (in fact, I rarely do)… but when I do, it’s usually osmanthus.

Osmanthus is such an underappreciated note. I first discovered how wonderful this flower smells via “Hermessence Osmanthe Yunnan” from Hermès (hands-down my favorite mainstream house, I think it’s the most genuinely creative). It smelled like stewed jelly beans, heavy on the peachy variety, and I’ve been hunting down osmanthus since. The problem is: it can easily be overpowered (as seen in Fyrinnae “Optimism”). But when done right, it’s like a peachy jasmine, with an undercurrent of oolang tea.

And that is what we get here. It opens very office-friendly (peachy jasmine), but over time deepens with tea-like notes and something a bit cooler. I’m glad my testing ended on a high note.

Rating: **5**/5 – heavenly

Aaaaaaaannnndddd… that’s it for this round! I’m still waiting for my January 2^(nd) CocoaPink order, but I’m not in a hurry for that one (longer TAT is expected, and my order will be in the next batch, going by their banner on the website).

(Pictures and Voice Memo in Post! Willing to Travel or Relocate for the Right Person!)","**As a quick preface, I would really appreciate it if you read the entire post! I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Nier Automata and Helldivers 2. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I was heavily involved in Belgian anti-fascist resistance movements in the 1940s
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-38 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~Is it ok to punch Nazis? 


Always has been.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

He’d be in the office everyday from 7am because he lived 10 mins away, however, I only worked in the office 2 days a week and the rest at home, this was great for me as I was 2 hours away by public transport. 

At first, this colleague seemed friendly. We didn’t really talk much at the start, but things escalated after I confided in him about a frightening incident on public transport on my way home from work where a man nearly attacked me. I was extremely shaken up and vulnerable at the time, I even had to contact the police. After that, this colleague began messaging me daily on Microsoft Teams during work hours and also after work hours, although I only ever saw those messages the next day. He was very conversational and initially seemed supportive. I also mentioned I had injured my shoulder from a fall and he offered advice, claiming he took a massage course. Eventually we exchanged phone numbers, which I did not think much of as I had exchanged numbers with other colleagues.

Not long after, his behaviour changed and became VERY inappropriate.

After I mentioned my injury and the fact I had to go to physio at a local gym, he started talking about how he goes to the gym and sauna every day. I initially engaged because I also enjoy going to the gym, but the conversations quickly became uncomfortable. One day he told me he had been swimming and using the sauna and said he was worried he would not be able to fit into his swimming pants because they were “too small” for him. I was completely disgusted and immediately changed the subject.

He then repeatedly suggested that I go to the gym and sauna with him after work because he had a guest pass. I politely declined every time. He would not stop asking or suggesting. He later suggested that I come to his house during a work break so he could massage my injured shoulder. I declined. I tried to redirect conversations back to work or neutral topics like music and films, but he used this as an opportunity to invite me to his house to watch movies. He told me he has lots of films on his hard drives and uploads pictures, videos and music to them daily…

He constantly brought the conversation back to the sauna. He told me he goes to another sauna every few weeks that is a nude sauna. He then said he had done nude photoshoots and asked if I wanted to see his explicit pictures. I did not respond because I was so disturbed. The next day he messaged me good morning and changed the subject.

During another conversation, he kept talking about how girls at the gym and sauna check out his body and like how he looks. I although I don’t what he said, I found it quite unsettling that he always referred to women as “girls”.

Things escalated further when he sent me a screenshot of a teenage girl’s TikTok video during work hours. The girl was wearing a crop top, hoodie and underwear and had two piercings near her belly button. He said “Just watched a TikTok and a girl has piercing on her side? Ever seen it before, looks painful.” At that point I was extremely disturbed. I stopped responding and began avoiding him in the office. Luckily, I was only in the office two days a week so it was easier to avoid him.

I told a few family members what was happening and told them I was considering reporting him. They advised me not to because at this point, I only had a few weeks left of my month contract. I avoided him as advised and didn’t report it.

After I stopped engaging, he began acting strangely at work. He sulked around the office, avoided greeting me and would not say goodbye. I was relieved, but he then began intentionally singling me out. One day I went for a coffee break with a colleague and when I returned I was completely locked out of my work laptop. I had not entered the wrong password and only attempted to log in once. Because he worked in IT, I had to go to him as the other IT guy was busy. He was visibly delighted and suddenly cheerful. After that, the messages started again. And he was cheerful around the office again, but way more than before! He was singing and dancing, and super loud!

I have no proof, but I strongly believe he locked me out on purpose to force contact. I went along with messaging again because it felt like he was signalling that he could make my remaining weeks difficult.

At this point, none of our conversations were about work. Every single conversation included the sauna. He later told me he had done a nude photoshoot in a sauna with a woman he met on a modelling website, then asked me if I would be interested in doing one with him. I immediately shut that down and said no.

He began confiding in me about his past relationships and then asked about mine. He asked personal questions about sex and asked if I was curious because I had never been in a relationship. I said no.

I deliberately gave short, dry replies or asked him questions so he could talk about himself instead of asking me things. Even when I did not respond, he kept messaging. He always returned to the sauna topic. His persistence felt frightening and violating… almost rapey. It felt like he would not stop until I said yes.

I never flirted with him. I am not attracted to older men and I am socially awkward and shy, I don’t flirt at all, so I know I did not give him the wrong impression. I declined every invitation and did nothing to encourage him, yet he continued. I felt guilty for wanting to report him because I was new and he had worked there for five years. He was well liked and respected and I feared not being believed.

Near the end of my contract, my replies became shorter. He asked what I planned to do next and I lied and said I wanted to move into cyber security. He offered help and before I could reply, he created a Dropbox account, sent me the login and said he had uploaded resources. He then made another account and said he would upload films from his hard drive. I never logged into either account and never will. He had previously told me he knows how to hack, and I would not be surprised if he uploaded spyware on the files or even the nude photos he so desperately wanted me to see. When I told my uncle about this, he said this behaviour sounded like grooming.

Later that week, it was raining heavily and my commute was difficult. My commute was two hours daily, which everyone knew. He messaged me and when I said it was a struggle, he said “If you brought some clothes with you, you could’ve stayed at mine.” Even in my final days, he would not stop.

On my last day, days before Christmas, he worked from home but signed a thank you card with the rest of the office. I messaged to thank him, just like I messaged everyone else and he replied saying we should keep in contact and meet up one day. I brushed it off.

After my contract ended, he told me he had resigned two days later. He said the manager was a “b\*tch” and kept picking on him, and that he was due to have a disciplinary but did not say why. He said he already had a new job and told me the company name and pay. I congratulated him. Soon after he wished me a happy new year, I blocked him.

I feel deep regret and shame for not reporting him at the time. I am now considering reporting him to both the previous company and his new employer. I’ve exported the entire chat and taken screenshots. He starts his new role in February. I keep thinking about the possibility of him doing this to another young woman. What I experienced was disturbing and exhausting and I do not want anyone else to go through it. What if his weird pushy, coercive behaviour actually works on a young, impressionable woman? I feel I should do something. ",0,1768872901.0,careeradvice,3,0.33,False

He immediately ran under a tree to some bushes and immediately ran out because there were ""naked ants"" there. He continued walking along the path and slipped on a puddle. He started complaining that he had sugar in his pocket and now he would have a ""caramel ass"" and that a ""French cat"" would come for a ""cane baguette."" He got up, shook himself off, and cursed the puddle, saying ""you're a slushy mess"" and ""I'll map this puddle as a lake now, let the deer lick it up."" then he spins around the puddle a little more and jumps into it, saying that this is ""jumping in McCoffee.""

1qhneny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Torontobluejays/comments/1qhneny/toronto_blue_jays_franchise_stats/,#Toronto Blue Jays Franchise Stats,"So I decided to fill my time by rolling through [Stathead](https://www.sports-reference.com/stathead/baseball/) looking for the franchise best/worst in certain rate stats.  For most lists I imposed a minimum to keep out the cup-of-coffee, trade deadline, and partial season results.  To qualify for those leaderboards, you needed to have enough combined plate appearances (PA) with the Blue Jays that it would qualify for a batting title (if condensed into a single season, 502), or enough combined innings pitched (IP) with the Blue Jays that it would qualify for an ERA title (if condensed into a single season, 162).

For the Canada-born lists with the qualifications, I simply listed everyone that qualified as there weren't that many.

1qhne2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1qhne2d/the_science_of_delayed_gratification_why/,The Science of Delayed Gratification: Why DISCIPLINE Pays Dividends Long-Term,"I've been reading a lot about delayed gratification lately. books, podcasts, and research papers. And honestly? It's wild how much we underestimate this skill. We live in a world that basically trains us to want everything NOW. instant delivery, endless scrolling, one-click purchases. Our brains are literally rewired for short-term dopamine hits.

Here's the thing, though. The gap between people who ""make it"" and people who don't often comes down to one thing: the ability to do boring, uncomfortable stuff consistently when nobody's watching. 

I'm not talking about some toxic hustle culture BS. I'm talking about understanding how your brain works and using that knowledge to actually build a life you're proud of.

Your brain is working against you (but you can fix it)

Our brains evolved to prioritise immediate rewards. makes sense when you think about it. our ancestors needed to eat NOW, not save berries for retirement. But in 2025, this wiring is killing us.

Research from Stanford's famous marshmallow experiment (and the decades of follow-up studies) shows that kids who could delay gratification ended up with better SAT scores, lower BMI, and higher income. But here's what's interesting. Recent studies show it's not just about willpower. It's about systems.

The compound effect is real but invisible.

James Clear talks about this in “Atomic Habits”. bestseller for a reason, dude knows his stuff. He breaks down how 1% improvements compound over time. If you get 1% better every day for a year, you end up 37 times better. sounds impossible, but the math checks out.

The problem? You won't see results for months. maybe years. And that's exactly why most people quit. They do the work for two weeks, see nothing, and bounce.

I started using this framework. Instead of setting huge goals, I focus on tiny daily actions. reading 10 pages. doing 10 pushups. writing 200 words. sounds stupid small, but after 6 months? Those habits stack up in ways you can't predict.

Dopamine hacking (the unsexy truth)

Dr Andrew Huberman explains this perfectly on his podcast. Every time you check Instagram or eat junk food or hit snooze, you're training your brain to seek immediate pleasure. And each time you do that, you make it HARDER to do hard things later.

But it works both ways. Each time you choose the harder option (getting up early, going to the gym, working on your side project), you're literally strengthening neural pathways. You're building what researchers call ""frustration tolerance.""

Here's a practical tip from his episode on dopamine. Try ""dopamine fasting"" before important tasks. no phone, no music, no coffee for 30 minutes. sounds horrible, but it works. Your brain becomes way more motivated to do the actual task because suddenly, that's the most stimulating thing available.

The app that actually helped me track this

I use Finch for building these micro-habits. It's like a little pet that grows when you complete daily tasks. sounds childish, but gamification works on everyone, not just kids. The app helps you set tiny goals and tracks your streaks without being annoying about it.

Another good one is Forest. You plant a virtual tree that dies if you use your phone during focus time. Weirdly effective because nobody wants to murder their little tree.

There's also this personalised learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from behavioural science research, expert podcasts, and psychology books to build custom audio learning plans. It's backed by a team from Columbia and Google, which shows in the quality. You can set a goal like ""build better discipline habits"" or ""stop self-sabotaging,"" and it creates a structured plan pulling from sources like Clear's work, Huberman's research, and other behavioural psychology experts. 

The depth customisation is clutch, you can do a quick 10-minute summary or go deep for 40 minutes with examples and context when something really clicks. Plus, you can chat with its AI coach about your specific struggles (like why you keep hitting snooze or doom-scrolling), and it'll adjust recommendations based on that. Makes the learning feel way less generic than just reading another productivity article.

The books that changed my perspective

""The War of Art"" by Steven Pressfield. This guy wrote about resistance before it was cool. He's a bestselling author who spent YEARS as a struggling writer before breaking through. The book is short, punchy, and will slap you in the face with truth. best book I've read on why we self-sabotage and how to push through the voice that says ""do it tomorrow.""

Pressfield calls out this thing he names Resistance with a capital R. It's the force that stops you from doing meaningful work. And his insight? The more important something is to your growth, the MORE resistance you'll feel. That's why scrolling feels easy and starting your novel feels impossible. This book will make you question everything about procrastination.

""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport. Newport is a computer science professor who published this while maintaining a strict 9-5 schedule and zero social media. The book argues that the ability to focus intensely is becoming rare AND valuable. he gives actual strategies for building concentration in a distracted world. 

One concept that stuck with me: attention residue. When you switch tasks, part of your brain stays stuck on the old task. so all that multitasking? You're literally making yourself dumber. The book includes protocols for structuring your day around deep work blocks. insanely practical.

Why it feels impossible (and why that's normal)

Your brain literally experiences delayed gratification as pain. MRI studies show that when you choose a delayed reward over an immediate one, the same brain regions light up as physical discomfort.

So yeah. It SHOULD feel hard. You're not broken. You're just fighting biology.

But knowing this actually helps. When I feel that resistance now, I recognise it as my brain doing its thing. doesn't make it easier, but it makes it less personal.

The relationship aspect nobody talks about

Discipline in one area bleeds into others. I noticed that when I started waking up at 6 am consistently, I also got better at not texting my ex, better at meal prep, and better at saving money. sounds unrelated, but your brain starts recognising you as someone who follows through.

Researcher Roy Baumeister found that self-control works like a muscle. It gets stronger with use but also gets tired. So start small. Pick ONE thing to be disciplined about. master that. Then add more.

Making it actually stick

The researchers at BJ Fogg's Behaviour Design Lab at Stanford found that motivation is unreliable. What works? tiny habits anchored to existing routines.

After I brush my teeth, I do one pushup. sounds pathetic, but that's the point. I always do more than one,e but the barrier is so low I can't talk myself out of it.

Accountability that doesn't suck

“Ash” is a newer app that works like having a therapist/coach in your pocket. It uses AI to help you work through mental blocks and track patterns. The relationship coaching feature is surprisingly good for identifying self-sabotage patterns.

Or just find one person to text daily. not a huge group. one person. You text them what you're committing to that day. They text you. That's it. Sounds simple, but social accountability is ridiculously powerful.

The science backs this up. You're 65% more likely to complete a goal if you commit to someone. And if you have a specific accountability appointment? 95%.

Look, I'm not gonna pretend discipline solves everything. Life is complicated, and sometimes you need rest, not more productivity hacks. But if you're tired of self-sabotaging, if you're frustrated watching other people build the life you want, this stuff works.

It's just slower and more boring than anyone wants to admit.",1,1768872751.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False

I never flirted with him. I am not attracted to older men and I am socially awkward and shy, I don’t flirt at all, so I know I did not give him the wrong impression. I declined every invitation and did nothing to encourage him, yet he continued. I felt guilty for wanting to report him because I was new and he had worked there for five years. He was well liked and respected and I feared not being believed.

Near the end of my contract, my replies became shorter. He asked what I planned to do next and I lied and said I wanted to move into cyber security. He offered help and before I could reply, he created a Dropbox account, sent me the login and said he had uploaded resources. He then made another account and said he would upload films from his hard drive. I never logged into either account and never will. He had previously told me he knows how to hack, and I would not be surprised if he uploaded spyware on the files or even the nude photos he so desperately wanted me to see. When I told my uncle about this, he said this behaviour sounded like grooming.

Later that week, it was raining heavily and my commute was difficult. My commute was two hours daily, which everyone knew. He messaged me and when I said it was a struggle, he said “If you brought some clothes with you, you could’ve stayed at mine.” Even in my final days, he would not stop.

On my last day, days before Christmas, he worked from home but signed a thank you card with the rest of the office. I messaged to thank him, just like I messaged everyone else and he replied saying we should keep in contact and meet up one day. I brushed it off.

After my contract ended, he told me he had resigned two days later. He said the manager was a “b\*tch” and kept picking on him, and that he was due to have a disciplinary but did not say why. He said he already had a new job and told me the company name and pay. I congratulated him. Soon after he wished me a happy new year, I blocked him.

I feel deep regret and shame for not reporting him at the time. I am now considering reporting him to both the previous company and his new employer. I’ve exported the entire chat and taken screenshots. He starts his new role in February. I keep thinking about the possibility of him doing this to another young woman. What I experienced was disturbing and exhausting and I do not want anyone else to go through it. What if his weird pushy, coercive behaviour actually works on a young, impressionable woman? I feel I should do something. Please offer advice. I’ve never experienced anything like this before. ",3,1768872693.0,careerguidance,0,0.71,False
