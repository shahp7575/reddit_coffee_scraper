-----------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a minimalist look using black decor can give your space a sophisticated and polished vibe. This design approach relies on simplicity while emphasizing the striking nature of black. Here are effective tips and techniques for you to achieve this beautiful aesthetic in your home.

### Choose the Right Shades of Black

Black comes in many shades, including matte, glossy, and textured finishes. When selecting black decor, consider the overall light levels and color palette of your space. A matte black offers warmth and depth, while a glossy black brings a modern and vibrant feel. Mixing different textures, like matte wall paint with glossy furniture, can create visual interest without overwhelming simplicity.

### Incorporate Minimalist Furniture

Opt for furniture pieces that embody sleek designs. Look for items with clean lines and understated details.

- **Coffee Tables:** A low-profile black coffee table can serve as a focal point, allowing other elements to breathe.
- **Seating:** Black chairs and sofas with simple shapes can anchor the room effortlessly.
- **Storage Solutions:** Choose black shelves or cabinets that blend into the walls instead of dominating the space.

When selecting your furniture, aim for multifunctional pieces to keep clutter at bay. This touches on the essence of minimalism—having less to maintain more.

### Use Accessories Wisely

Accessories can make or break your minimalist black decor. Since less is more, choose statement pieces that serve both function and form. Here are some ideas:

- **Art:** A large black-and-white artwork or a single bold graphic print can create a dramatic focal point.
- **Textiles:** Cushions or throws in soft textures invite comfort without drawing attention away from the overall theme.
- **Lighting:** Consider black pendant lights or floor lamps that add elegance without cluttering the designs.

Remember, every accessory should be meaningful, enhancing the overall look without complicating it.

### Focus on Lighting

The lighting in your space can dramatically affect how black decor is perceived. Consider these lighting options:

- **Natural Light:** Maximize natural light by keeping windows unobstructed. The contrast of black against light will enhance the minimalist style.
- **Warm Bulbs:** Use warm-toned light bulbs to soften the starkness of black decor and create a cozy ambiance.
- **Accent Lighting:** Integrate spotlights or wall sconces to highlight specific features or areas without overwhelming the design.

Investing in good lighting can lead to a drastically different look for your space, allowing your black decor to thrive.

### Accent with Neutrals

Introducing neutral colors can enhance the minimalist look while softening the starkness of black. Earthy tones, whites, and soft grays can balance and support the boldness of black decor. Consider using:

- **Wall Colors:** Soft neutral paints can complement black furniture and accessories nicely.
- **Flooring:** Wooden or light-colored flooring can provide contrast, making black decor stand out beautifully.
- **Greenery:** Plants in neutral planters add a pop of life and color while adhering to a minimalist style.

This method not only preserves a sophisticated aesthetic but also contributes to a more harmonious atmosphere.

### Layer with Textures

In a minimalist environment, textures can add depth and interest without creating clutter. Use various materials to give your space character. Consider:

- **Finishes:** Combine black leather, fabric, and metal to create layers.
- **Rugs:** A textured black rug can pull the room together while adding warmth.
- **Wall Treatments:** A painted black feature wall, shiplap, or wallpaper can serve as a stunning backdrop.

Textures invite touch and visual curiosity, enriching your minimalist design seamlessly.

With these tips and techniques, you can achieve a striking minimalist look with black decor. Embrace simplicity while allowing the powerful nature of black to define your space. Remember, the key to success is balancing functionality and aesthetics, crafting an atmosphere that is both calming and visually intriguing.

The Impact of Color Psychology in Minimalist Black Interiors
------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a minimalist black interior can be a liberating design choice. The strategic use of black in interiors goes beyond aesthetics; it taps into the principles of color psychology, influencing emotions and perceptions in profound ways. When you embrace black decor while maintaining a minimalist approach, you unlock a world of elegant simplicity that speaks to a deeper understanding of space and color.

Color psychology suggests that colors evoke certain feelings and reactions. Black, often associated with sophistication and elegance, can also invoke feelings of comfort, authority, and strength. By using black in a minimalist design, you subtly harness these emotional responses to create an inviting yet powerful atmosphere. Here are some of the impacts of incorporating black into your minimalist decor:

- **Creates a Sense of Calm:** Black tones have a grounding effect, establishing a serene sanctuary that encourages relaxation. In a minimalist space, where distractions are minimized, black walls or furniture can provide a peaceful and uniform background.
- **Enhances Focus:** A black decor palette eliminates visual clutter. This simplicity helps keep the mind clear, allowing you to focus on what truly matters in your space. Minimalism paired with black creates a calm environment ideal for work or study.
- **Increases Perceived Space:** Surprisingly, black can make a room feel more expansive. When executed correctly, dark colors absorb light and create depth. In minimalist interiors, fewer features mean that black accents can create contrasts that enhance the perception of space.
- **Emphasizes Texture:** Minimalist interiors often rely on the interplay of materials. Black decor highlights textures, making wood grain, fabric weaves, and other details stand out. This element adds richness to the design, ensuring the space feels inviting without overwhelming the senses.
- **Establishes a Timeless Aesthetic:** Black is eternally stylish. A minimalist black setting exudes timeless elegance that can easily be updated with changing trends through accessories. The inherent simplicity of black allows it to serve as a classic backdrop, announcing versatility in design.

When considering how to achieve a harmonious balance in your black minimalist interior, keep these strategies in mind:

- **Layer Shades of Black:** Incorporate varying shades within your black decor. This layering will create visual interest while preserving the minimalist aesthetic. Look at matte vs. gloss finishes or incorporate dark charcoal tones alongside pure black.
- **Introduce Accents:** Utilize small doses of color through accessories or plants. Vibrant artworks, throw pillows, or greenery can pop against a black background, providing balance and liveliness without overpowering the minimalist theme.
- **Focus on Functional Furniture:** Choose functional yet visually striking furniture pieces. A sleek black sofa or streamlined tables can serve as statement pieces without cluttering your space. Opt for items that embody simplicity and serve a purpose.
- **Use Natural Light Wisely:** To prevent the space from feeling too enclosed, maximize natural light. Mirrors or reflective surfaces can enhance the flow of light, bouncing it around the black decor to create a more open feeling.

Elements of color psychology into your design not only elevates the aesthetic appeal of your home but also enriches your personal experience within that space. With black decor, you can create a canvas that nurtures creativity, concentration, and tranquility. Embrace the dual aspects of minimalist black interiors: their visual simplicity, and the powerful psychological undercurrents they project. The result will be a chic and sophisticated environment that resonates with your core values and lifestyle.

Ultimately, achieving a minimalist look with black decor is a fulfilling journey. By being mindful of how colors interact with mood and atmosphere, you can design a balanced, inviting space that reflects minimalism's elegance. When executed thoughtfully, black can transform your home into a haven of simplicity that exudes both character and serenity.

### Conclusion

Embracing a minimalist look with black decor has the power to transform your space and elevate your design aesthetic. By incorporating essential tips and techniques, such as selecting the right balance of textures and materials, you can create an inviting environment that feels effortlessly chic. Remember, simplicity is key; minimizing clutter and opting for statement pieces will help you achieve that sleek aesthetic you desire.

anyway, it feels like all the responsibility of taking care of her has fallen on me. she’s pressured me to take care of her my whole life, especially during her drunken, manipulative trauma dumps. i’ve always told her she’s not my responsibility, that i don’t owe her anything—but in the back of mind i know that I can’t bring myself to leave her on her own. in my dad’s culture, we live by the fa’a samoa way, (along with God) family always comes first. The whole purpose is to serve your famiy. Even though i don’t want this responsibility, it’s hard not to feel guilty because I want to carry out the traditions in my culture but there’s so many conflicting circumstances.

but because of this, i’m giving up my dream, and it makes me so sad. my dream, even if it sounds stupid (and i don’t care if it does), is to save up enough money to buy a bus, renovate it, get a dog, and travel across the country—or maybe even the entire north american continent and live in solitude. i’d sell coffee out of my bus to make a living and run an online clothing brand on the side. it’s simple, it’s attainable, and it’s all i really want. but because of my situation, i know i can’t make it happen.
so instead, i’m in community college, studying in a medical assisting program, just until i figure out what career i’ll be stuck in for the rest of my life. not because i love it, but because i need a stable job to house my mom. it sucks that i can’t live the life i want. it feels like i’m trading my dream for hers, and no matter how much i tell myself it’s the right thing to do, it doesn’t make it any less painful.",1,1735718582.0,venting,1,1.0,False

It was sexy but don't think thats normal?,"So, I (22F) recently went on a first date with this guy (31M) I’d been texting for about a month and a half. We decided to grab coffee, and I was feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. I ended up wearing this top that’s a little low-cut, and honestly, it made my boobs (DD Cups) look *amazing.*

Normally, I’m a bit more modest with my clothing choices, but my friend practically talked me into wearing her shirt. She kept insisting I looked great in it showing some cleavage, and after some playful “bullying,” I ended up giving in. As much as I was hesitant at first, I ended up feeling confident. It was a mix of shyness and, at the same time, feeling a little sexy in a way I wasn’t used to.

The date was super chill, though. We spent like two hours just talking, laughing (he made me laugh a lot btw very funny guy), and even getting into some deeper stuff. It didn’t feel like your typical first date awkwardness. It was pretty effortless, which was such a nice surprise.

But what really stood out to me was how he acted. I was wearing a top that was definitely more revealing than I usually would, but not once did he even try to glance at my chest. It was like it wasn’t even on his radar at the end he just cupped my cheeks in his hands kissed at the end of out date. Honestly, I was impressed. It made me feel like he was way more focused on who I am as a person, not just what I looked like.

I’m sitting the NY bar exam in February this year, and my choices as a foreign lawyer will be Albany or Buffalo.

While I’d have loved to visit Buffalo and see the falls, it would be easier if I get Albany due to its proximity to NYC.

Nevertheless, I’ve made tentative hotel bookings in both cities, and wanted to get this subreddit’s opinion on my choice of neighbourhood in Buffalo and ask a couple other questions.

1. I’ve picked a chain hotel in the downtown area in a street where I see there are many restaurants and cafes. Is downtown Buffalo like some cities where it’s quite dead and sketchy after business hours, or is it lively into the evenings?

I am a solo female traveller, and I’d like to be able to walk around and get myself some food / coffee as a study break, and I’m hoping it’s a safe walkable area. 

2. I plan to use Amtrak Empire Service to travel from NYC Penn Stn to Buffalo - has anyone used this service, and how did you find it? 

3. Anything special (other than the Falls) that I shouldn’t leave Buffalo without visiting?

( End of Intimacy),"Becoming a father was one of the happiest moments of my life. When my twin daughters were born, it felt like my world had doubled in love and joy. But fast forward to four years later, and things weren’t as picture-perfect as I imagined.

My wife and I barely had time for each other. Between work, chores, and taking care of the twins, our marriage started to feel more like a partnership for survival than a loving relationship. We weren’t spending quality time together, and intimacy had taken a backseat. I loved my family, but it felt like we were losing touch as a couple.

One day, a friend gave me some unexpected advice. He said, “You need to find a hobby for your kids—something that keeps them engaged and gives you and your wife time to reconnect.” At first, I wasn’t sure what to try, but then he mentioned coloring pages.

I decided to give it a shot. I found a great app called [Coloring Pages,](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.colouringprintouts.app&pcampaignid=web_share) which offered tons of printable designs for kids. I printed out 10 to 20 pages at a time—everything from animals and princesses to fun patterns they could color however they wanted. I handed them crayons and the pages, and to my surprise, they were completely hooked.

For the first time in ages, my wife and I had time to ourselves. We started using those precious 1–2 hours to talk, laugh, and just be together without the constant interruptions of parenting. It wasn’t anything fancy—sometimes we’d sit and have coffee, other times we’d watch a movie or just enjoy each other’s company. But those little moments made a huge difference.

The best part is that the twins absolutely love coloring now. They look forward to their ""creative time"" every day, and it’s been great for their focus and creativity. Sometimes, we even join them and make it a family activity.

Looking back, it’s amazing how something as simple as coloring pages helped us reconnect as a couple while also keeping our kids entertained and happy. If you’re a parent feeling stretched thin, I can’t recommend this enough. The Coloring Pages app made it so easy to find age-appropriate designs, and it became a small but meaningful part of our routine.

Marriage and parenting are both full of challenges, but sometimes, the simplest solutions can make the biggest difference. For us, it all started with a few crayons and some coloring pages.",0,1735716460.0,Parenting,5,0.25,False

1hqxxct,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hqxxct/how_can_i_get_a_girl_to_like_me/,How can I get a girl to like me?,"So theres a bit of context to this, I had added this girl randomly a while ago and asked her out, she agreed to a date and it ended up getting postponed a couple of times before she ghosted me 2 days before the date was supposed to be. I messaged her like a week later asking if I did something wrong and she apologized and said that she just came out of a long term relationship and thought she was ready to date again but she wasn't, we talked it out and whatever then didn't talk for a couple of months. I jokingly asked her 2 months later, ""sushi tomorrow?"" and received a yes, surprisingly. 



She postponed a few more times, and I was annoyed at that point and after she didn't respond in 2 days said ""you know you can just say no lmao"", which she received as me being pushy, she said that she wanted to but wasn't interested anymore, I said that I understood and that I felt the communication was one way because she wasn't telling me what days worked for her, just that days we agreed to didn't work, or that something came up and we had to postpone (again). she saw my side and apologized and said that she was more focusing on herself currently and not actively looking for a relationship, and that she would be cool with proceeding as friends and maybe something would happen in the future.

  
we hung out a few times as friends, we got coffee, and I smoked weed for the first time with her, which I thought were dates but I wasn't really being forward enough apparently. We're still friends, yesterday we went out and got carolina reaper chicken together then binge watched anime for 5 hours at my place. My goal is to get closer to her to because I do really like her (even though what I wrote kind of portrays her as an asshole, there was a lot more context but I don't want to go into excruciating detail), but she is not looking for a relationship, she even wants to help me set up a dating profile lmao. 



I caught feelings for her and I like spending time with her. We do genuinely have a great time when we spend time together, but I know shes not looking for something and I am. I'm okay with waiting for her to be ready for a relationship, but I feel bad spending time with her when my goal is to eventually have a relationship with her when I know she doesn't feel that way about me. Are there any ways to make platonic girl friends like you in a non-platonic way? I've been working out myself pretty frequently and have lost about 50 lbs but still have a bit more to lose. Are there specific things I can say to them? The only thing I feel like I can do is distance myself from her, even if its temporary. Every time I hang out I fantasize about what could be and it makes me sad that she doesn't feel like that about me, and I don't want to spend all this time investing into a relationship between her and me just for our friendship to fall apart because I think of her as more than a friend, or if she finds a bf and doesn't give me a chance, I would be devastated, I'm not gonna lie. I feel like creating distance would be the healthiest choice here, we have a lot of the same values and she even goes out of her way to make time to spend with me, but I don't want to waste both of our time.",1,1735715520.0,NoStupidQuestions,10,0.67,False
1hqxx6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1hqxx6u/im_breaking_girl_code_but_can_it_be_better/,I'm breaking girl code but can it be better?,"So I'm at a bar tonight with a group of girls. My one friend (friend A) asks friend B to get a guy to come over to our group to come talk to Friend A because she thinks he is cute. 

Throughout the night, I get to talking to him (we're in a group) and we really hit it off. We laugh at each other's jokes, I find out he's looking for same things as me, a total match. 

Now, I'm frustrated because Friend B said I couldn't talk to him because she found him for friend A and friend A only. I didn't want to loose my chance at a real match so i snuck away to also ask for his #. 

So, yes, I broke the girl code without them looking and get his number. I want to text him tomorrow but I don't know how to go about this. Advice? 

I don't know Friend A very well but I AM trying to get into her circle of friends with her and be gal pals. I know this goes against that so I'm wondering if there is someway I could make this work or even just a coffee hang with no expectations. If he and Friend A really had something developing, I'd 100% drop out. But I just wanted to at least try. 

I ended up putting his number into my phone because I had a split second to ask for it and couldn't wait on how potentially slow he'd be haha. I literally said ""hey I really enjoyed talking with you and I'd love to just meet up and hangout sometime if you ever want to. I think you should still go on a date with Friend A but if you ever want to get together, I'll reach out and we can plan something.""

I feel like this approach was softer and less dramatic than strictly breaking girl code. Idk. Advice on what to do because I want to at least give a text tomorrow a shot. If he truly did like me, that's they only way I'd know. Thanks. ",8,1735715499.0,dating,15,0.9,False

1hqxwhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1hqxwhx/i_developed_an_intense_emotional_dependence_on_an/,"I developed an intense emotional dependence on an older, emotionally distant alcoholic woman who gives me mixed signals, and it's overwhelming me,a lot.","I'm a university student and a writer, and I often go to a somewhat sketchy café where I drink an absurd amount of coffee, write, and try to get inspired. About three months ago, I noticed this incredibly tall, somewhat androgynous woman who was clearly feminine. The first thing I noticed was how her gestures, mannerisms, and the way she carried herself were very masculine. I also noticed that she ordered an impressive amount of alcohol. Since I'm an extrovert (though I was a bit nervous), I approached her after debating it for about 16 minutes. I told her something that, in hindsight, was pretty stupid: I said I had a character in one of my stories that was basically her, and I explained that I write and go to this café regularly. I said this in a cheerful and concise way. She was already a little tipsy, chuckled, and said she was flattered. I’m pretty sure I blushed a little, but I brushed it off and asked if I could sit with her. She said yes. We had a casual conversation. She told me she didn’t go to the café often but came in because she figured they had alcohol. I told her it was a great place, exaggerating a bit to convince her to return. I asked her name, and we talked for almost four hours. When we finished, I offered to drive her home since we’re both women, and it was late. She said she had her car and was fine. To stay in touch, I asked if she planned on coming back and what time she usually did. I told her my usual schedule, and we said goodbye. The following Monday, I arrived around 8:30 PM, and she showed up at 9:00. She sat next to me, and we started talking again. I told her I felt restless sitting for too long and asked if she wanted to go for a walk. She agreed, and we strolled around the streets, chatting. This happened repeatedly over the next week—around seven days of us meeting ""accidentally on purpose"" and talking. Then, one day, a friend invited me to a Jewish party (I don’t quite remember the occasion), and I invited her along. I told her she could bring someone else if she wanted and not to worry about it. At the party, there were people our age and older, so it felt pretty normal. We stayed for about two hours before stepping out to talk. I invited her to have dinner at my place, mentioning (falsely) that other friends would be there. We went to my house, and I actually cooked dinner for her. She complimented my cooking and made a flirty joke about traditional roles. Since I live a bit outside the city, it was hard for her to leave so late, so I offered her one of my guest rooms. She agreed. I usually wake up at 4:00 AM, so that morning, I did my usual routine, then waited for her to wake up. When she did, I made her breakfast, and she left. We continued seeing each other at the café, and at some point, as our friendship grew, she asked for my number—not romantically, just because we’d become close. Over the next month, we became ""best friends."" We went out every single day, doing everything together: brunches, picnics, museums, libraries, movies, and more. Everything felt normal until one day I invited her for a sleepover. Knowing she liked alcohol, I bought a lot of whiskey. We watched a ton of movies, listened to music, danced, and although I have a pool, only I swam while she smoked from a chair. That night, she got pretty drunk and said a lot of random stuff, also told me she was 30 years old. Based on her appearance, I thought she was around 26 to 28, so it was a bit surprising. I’m 19, but I didn’t think much of it because I’ve always been more mature for my age, due to my high IQ and faster developtment of brain and maturity. That night, she also shared other irrelevant things before going to sleep in a small room I have that’s kind of a cute storage space. I brought her a blanket and, playfully, put it over her head. She kept pulling it off, laughing. I did this about four times until, apparently annoyed, she jokingly cursed at me and pulled me onto the bed and roughly kissed me. It’s worth mentioning that I’m a bit short (4’9” and underweight due to anorexia), while she’s 6’0” and much stronger. When she pulled me, I ended up on top of her, but then she flipped us so she was on top. Feeling her weight, I grabbed her arm to signal I wanted to switch positions, so we rolled again. This happened a few times until we fell off the bed. Startled, I let out a small scream and got up quickly. She sat up, and since it was so awkward, I just left. I wasn’t drunk, so I went straight to bed. The next morning, everything seemed normal. I assumed she didn’t remember anything because of how much she drank, and since she didn’t bring it up, I didn’t either. I made her breakfast, and she left. We continued seeing each other, talking, and going out as usual. There were days when she opened up about very personal things. One day, she told me about her time in the military, which made a lot of sense considering how physically strong she was—seriously, she was incredibly strong. I’d say our entire relationship was a friendship charged with tension. I divide our time into three phases: the first month, when we met and built trust; the second month, which I just described, where we grew closer and shared deeper conversations (including the kiss incident); and the third month, which I haven’t covered yet—where things escalated due to several factors and a specific situation that frustrated me. In the third month, I realized how much of an alcoholic she was. It didn’t take long to notice, but I didn’t give it much importance (again, lol). She would text me while drunk, sending short, often poorly written messages. Since she’s a millennial and very sarcastic, her messages were usually either overly brief or laced with irony. Despite this, she was serious in real life and mostly in text conversations. There were days when she bombarded me with messages, saying things like, “Can I go to your house?” or “Can I come over?” or even “I need you.” These texts felt urgent, but by the next day or a few hours later, she’d delete them. Most of the time, I didn’t even see the messages before they disappeared. When I did catch them, she’d act like nothing had happened. This was the biggest issue in our relationship: she’d do things and then brush them off with a casual “Oh, I was drunk.” I rarely asked her about it, but when I did, she’d dismiss it completely. This behavior frustrated me immensely. One day, after leaving work, it was raining heavily. I could’ve gone home with one of my theater buddies since they live nearby, but of course, I didn’t (love you know). I’m the only one out who lives far away. Sometimes, I bike home if I’m heading to a friend’s place first and hope they’ll drive me the rest of the way. That day, I biked to her apartment and arrived soaking wet. To my surprise, she was very drunk but still recognized me. Here’s where things got intense. Drenched, I expected her to just let me into her apartment. Instead, she told me to take off my wet clothes, saying she’d get me something. She showed me to the bathroom, and I stayed in my underwear because I’m very delicate about that. Eventually, she knocked on the door and handed me a leather jacket with a warm lining. Our height difference meant the jacket reached halfway down my thighs. I’m pretty sure she did it on purpose or maybe just didn’t have anything else. I came out, and she gave me a towel for my hair. Nervously, I told her I just needed to stay a bit and would call a cab. Instead, she picked me up bridal style, took me to her bed, and offered me a beer (lol) but I refused—which later she drank herself. Then, she made me coffee. Sitting beside her in just my underwear and her oversized jacket made me extremely nervous. I tried to keep my distance, but she just looked at me. I’m very insecure and don’t like comments about my appearance, even compliments. She knew this, and despite being drunk, she started talking about my femininity and delicate nature. She said I was “dainty” in a way that felt sincere. The way she spoke made me feel so special. I couldn’t believe a drunk person could say such heartfelt things without meaning them. As she talked, she moved closer until she was leaning on my shoulder, smelling me. I wear a lot of perfume daily and use countless scented products. She mentioned this as she leaned in. Then, she slowly unzipped the jacket to my lower abdomen, placed her hands on my ribs, and kissed my neck and torso—never my chest. I’m very sensitive about touch and was initially uncomfortable, but nothing she did felt inappropriate. It was soft, deliberate, and respectful in its own way. Her kisses on my abdomen and ribs made me hyperventilate. For a moment, I almost fainted. Eventually, she picked me up again and left me in her closet with her clothes, telling me to change. I didn’t like it but had no choice. When the rain stopped, she drove me home in her truck, putting my bike in the back. After that, I avoided talking to her for about a week because I was so overwhelmed. She eventually came to my house and stayed over one night. The next day, I had invited some elderly women I play tennis with at a club. I told her I was going shopping for the lunch—an excuse because I love shopping. She didn’t bring up what had happened, and I didn’t either. I gave her breakfast and then took her shopping. I bought her high-waisted blue pants, a soft fabric belt, and a loose white silk shirt with buttons. Meanwhile, I bought about seven dresses and several pairs of heels. Later, some elderly ladies mistook her for my boyfriend because of her androgynous style and height. That evening, we had a well you know sophisticated dinner. Afterward, we visited a paid-entry garden (capitalism, ugh).And you know, in the car, I didn’t do anything. I just smoked. She obviously noticed, so she asked me about it. I didn’t want to tell her, but she pulled over to the side of the road and confronted me. And you know, I started crying in a millisecond—almost screaming—and told her about it. Not everything I was feeling, but mostly about what she did and how she couldn’t just do that and then ignore it or pretend it didn’t happen. Even though it wasn’t explicit, I basically confessed part of my feelings for her. She was shocked, lol. She told me she had been super drunk and didn’t remember anything, saying she was sorry for making me feel that way. She insisted it wasn’t her intention and that she didn’t want me to see things the wrong way. She explained that when she’s drunk, she says things randomly without thinking. BUT LIKE, HOW CAN SHE SAY THAT? HOW CAN SHE DO THAT? It HAS to mean something—UGH. Anyway, after the car incident, we went to the garden, and I calmed down a little. But obviously, I went home completely devastated. I didn’t want to talk to her after that. When I say I didn’t want to talk to her, I mean for a few days. We’re talking normally now, but our ""visits"" have decreased because neither of us brings it up. But, you know, it really bothers me. I think it traumatized me a little. Recently, she’s been texting and calling me a lot, and I don’t know what to do. Oh, and by the way, I know her dad was also an alcoholic and emotionally distant, while her mom was normal but conservative. So I assume she might be closeted? I don't know but the whole situation is overwhelming me. So Do you think there are real feelings behind it or just confusion and me being delusional?",1,1735715413.0,confession,3,0.56,False
1hqxvvr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hqxvvr,Stolen bike ,"My rental has been continuously robbed since 2008. Everything my father owns is here; it’s not much. First they came for camera bodies Nikons and old film cameras from the 1960’s. These were my mothers fathers heirloom things. He died in 1974. They stayed long enough to take a shower and leave their shoes. 

The second time was a few years later and again shortly before Christmas. They took the camera lenses and left a white baseball cap. A police report was filed to ask for DNA. Police did Nothing. 

Sometime in the midst of these thefts they also came and took appliances like a washer and dryer. Entry was through the dead bolt back door. Obviously the Perp must have had a truck. 

My mom long suspected it was people related to her sisters daughter who spent 5 years in jail for drugs. 

Then 6/24 my Trek 950 dark green 1992 model was stolen out of a locked shed in my backyard. I posted on fbook who I thought it was and deadbolted the shed; a few days later that deadbolt was hacked off the shed. Taunting me. 

I have never had to file police reports except Acadiana. 

I want to post the names of the people I suspect here. My aunts daughter died but her daughter Sara Demourelle Richard is a felon. She is associated with ‘Christa’ a friend in Duson who she stays with. She recently had a baby. Congrats! 

My aunt was ‘one step away from rehab’ last January 2024; I let her granddaughter stay with her at my place while I went to a testing center in Baton Rouge. 

Sara stayed here with her father Paul who lives in Carencro. Paul hangs out with another guy named Paul Leblanc who is a four time felon on state labor. Then there is a guy named Todd Thibodeaux. 

If you google Thibodeaux manning Lowe’s you will see that this man owns a white truck. In broad daylight he stole items a person bought at Lowe’s out of the bed of their truck shortly after purchase. This was brazen in broad daylight. I now suspect this same truck was involved in the appliance theft and my recent bike theft. 

Kind hearted people replaced my fathers appliances. But I haven’t gotten my bike back. 

Description of bike: 
1992 trek 950. Dark green. Sticker with ‘earls cyclery’ on it. I bought it in Burlington Vermont around 1993. I had it for 30 yrs until losing it this year. It’s my baby. It has upright handlebars fitted to my frame. It has a toolkit with my card name and phone number email on it. Two water bottle holders, a new seat, pedals with straps, a bike pump. Reflectors on front and back and a bell. I want it back. It was the first thing I bought after returning to America from my time in the US peace corps in east Africa. It was my baby. 

I am posting screenshots of the ‘manning incident’ from 2018 at Lowe’s. There is a video available to watch on Facebook if you google it. 
I believe Todd thibodeaux is the culprit. But it could be Paul Leblanc. Any of the names I mentioned could also be involved as well as these. A woman named Christina who tried to date Paul demouroelke. She supposedly lives in Breaux bridge and has a daughter ‘just like Sara’ with oppositional defiant disorder. Sara is smart. She was adopted and went to Westminster but then somehow got involved with drugs, theivery, and bad eggs. I suspect she is at best very impressionable and at worst, mentally challenged. She has tried to reform herself. Her grandmother is my deceased mothers sister. 

Todd thibodeaux was on my aunts phone when she came to stay with me. He evidently knew her from he second husband who worked in car sales. Carol crochet? They lived in Sunset for many years. I asked Judy if she knew Todd and he had texted saying he wanted to see her. 

Last fall he came to see her. It was obvious years had passed since they had seen or talked. But since she was about to go to a nursing home I let them chat. 

I last saw Todd after Sara, Paul, Christina were here for a month in January 2024. We had coffee. I told him my aunt needed a wheelchair to fold up and put in my car so I could take her to church. He said he could get one for me because ‘he worked in Opelousas at st Landry hospital’. He said ‘I will be back’. Then texted me later saying ‘I want you’. Lol. A few days later my bike was stolen out of my locked shed. At 3 am. The left side of the lock had been hacked off with a crow bar. 

Now I gave the police a long list of other people. AA teenagers looking for work, landlords yard laborers. And this list above. ",4,1735715333.0,Acadiana,6,0.83,False

I just came back from a new years eve dinner at my aunts place with my mom, and where I live it's common for people, especially young people, to go to clubs right after. We however went straight home, and we stopped to say hi and wish a happy new year to some neighbours. They immediately asked me WHY I wasn't out dancing (like it's a duty of some sort) and they just kept going at it ""you don't like going out? What do you mean you don't like going out? Even my teenage granddaughter is out dancing right now, do you not go to clubs like ever???""

I felt so humiliated by this because it made me think of all the times I've been reminded in one way or another that I don't fit in and that I'm different. ""Why don't  you ever talk to anyone? How come you've never dated anyone, are you lesbian? What is wrong with you? What ever is that music and shows you like? You're weird. Hey, your friend over there, is sher******* or something?"" are some of the things I've heard said to or about me all my life.

The worst part if that ever since the pandemic it became trend to brag online about how you'd rather ""stay home with a cuo of coffee and a book than going out"" but when I do just that I get a visceral reaction from people like I just confessed to a murder.

About three months ago, I noticed this incredibly tall, somewhat androgynous woman who was clearly feminine. The first thing I noticed was how her gestures, mannerisms, and the way she carried herself were very masculine. I also noticed that she ordered an impressive amount of alcohol.

Since I'm an extrovert (though I was a bit nervous), I approached her after debating it for about 16 minutes. I told her something that, in hindsight, was pretty stupid: I said I had a character in one of my stories that was basically her, and I explained that I write and go to this café regularly. I said this in a cheerful and concise way. She was already a little tipsy, chuckled, and said she was flattered. I’m pretty sure I blushed a little, but I brushed it off and asked if I could sit with her. She said yes.

We had a casual conversation. She told me she didn’t go to the café often but came in because she figured they had alcohol. I told her it was a great place, exaggerating a bit to convince her to return. I asked her name, and we talked for almost four hours. When we finished, I offered to drive her home since we’re both women, and it was late. She said she had her car and was fine. To stay in touch, I asked if she planned on coming back and what time she usually did. I told her my usual schedule, and we said goodbye.

The following Monday, I arrived around 8:30 PM, and she showed up at 9:00. She sat next to me, and we started talking again. I told her I felt restless sitting for too long and asked if she wanted to go for a walk. She agreed, and we strolled around the streets, chatting. This happened repeatedly over the next week—around seven days of us meeting ""accidentally on purpose"" and talking. Then, one day, a friend invited me to a Jewish party (I don’t quite remember the occasion), and I invited her along. I told her she could bring someone else if she wanted and not to worry about it.

At the party, there were people our age and older, so it felt pretty normal. We stayed for about two hours before stepping out to talk. I invited her to have dinner at my place, mentioning (falsely) that other friends would be there. We went to my house, and I actually cooked dinner for her. She complimented my cooking and made a flirty joke about traditional roles. Since I live a bit outside the city, it was hard for her to leave so late, so I offered her one of my guest rooms. She agreed.

I usually wake up at 4:00 AM, so that morning, I did my usual routine, then waited for her to wake up. When she did, I made her breakfast, and she left. We continued seeing each other at the café, and at some point, as our friendship grew, she asked for my number—not romantically, just because we’d become close.

Over the next month, we became ""best friends."" We went out every single day, doing everything together: brunches, picnics, museums, libraries, movies, and more. Everything felt normal until one day I invited her for a sleepover. Knowing she liked alcohol, I bought a lot of whiskey. We watched a ton of movies, listened to music, danced, and although I have a pool, only I swam while she smoked from a chair.

That night, she got pretty drunk and said a lot of random stuff, also told me she was 30 years old. Based on her appearance, I thought she was around 26 to 28, so it was a bit surprising. I’m 19, but I didn’t think much of it because I’ve always been more mature for my age, due to my high IQ and faster developtment of brain and maturity. That night, she also shared other irrelevant things before going to sleep  in a small room I have that’s kind of a cute storage space. I brought her a blanket and, playfully, put it over her head. She kept pulling it off, laughing. I did this about four times until, apparently annoyed, she jokingly cursed at me and pulled me onto the bed and roughly kissed me.

It’s worth mentioning that I’m a bit short (4’9” and underweight due to anorexia), while she’s 6’0” and much stronger. When she pulled me, I ended up on top of her, but then she flipped us so she was on top. Feeling her weight, I grabbed her arm to signal I wanted to switch positions, so we rolled again. This happened a few times until we fell off the bed. Startled, I let out a small scream and got up quickly. She sat up, and since it was so awkward, I just left. I wasn’t drunk, so I went straight to bed.

The next morning, everything seemed normal. I assumed she didn’t remember anything because of how much she drank, and since she didn’t bring it up, I didn’t either. I made her breakfast, and she left. We continued seeing each other, talking, and going out as usual. There were days when she opened up about very personal things. One day, she told me about her time in the military, which made a lot of sense considering how physically strong she was—seriously, she was incredibly strong. I’d say our entire relationship was a friendship charged with tension. I divide our time into three phases: the first month, when we met and built trust; the second month, which I just described, where we grew closer and shared deeper conversations (including the kiss incident); and the third month, which I haven’t covered yet—where things escalated due to several factors and a specific situation that frustrated me.

In the third month, I realized how much of an alcoholic she was. It didn’t take long to notice, but I didn’t give it much importance (again, lol). She would text me while drunk, sending short, often poorly written messages. Since she’s a millennial and very sarcastic, her messages were usually either overly brief or laced with irony. Despite this, she was serious in real life and mostly in text conversations.

There were days when she bombarded me with messages, saying things like, “Can I go to your house?” or “Can I come over?” or even “I need you.” These texts felt urgent, but by the next day or a few hours later, she’d delete them. Most of the time, I didn’t even see the messages before they disappeared. When I did catch them, she’d act like nothing had happened. This was the biggest issue in our relationship: she’d do things and then brush them off with a casual “Oh, I was drunk.” I rarely asked her about it, but when I did, she’d dismiss it completely. This behavior frustrated me immensely. One day, after leaving work, it was raining heavily. I could’ve gone home with one of my theater buddies since they live nearby, but of course, I didn’t (love you know). I’m the only one out who lives far away. Sometimes, I bike home if I’m heading to a friend’s place first and hope they’ll drive me the rest of the way. That day, I biked to her apartment and arrived soaking wet. To my surprise, she was very drunk but still recognized me.

Here’s where things got intense. Drenched, I expected her to just let me into her apartment. Instead, she told me to take off my wet clothes, saying she’d get me something. She showed me to the bathroom, and I stayed in my underwear because I’m very delicate about that. Eventually, she knocked on the door and handed me a leather jacket with a warm lining. Our height difference meant the jacket reached halfway down my thighs. I’m pretty sure she did it on purpose or maybe just didn’t have anything else.

I came out, and she gave me a towel for my hair. Nervously, I told her I just needed to stay a bit and would call a cab. Instead, she picked me up bridal style, took me to her bed, and offered me a beer (lol) but I refused—which later she drank herself. Then, she made me coffee. Sitting beside her in just my underwear and her oversized jacket made me extremely nervous. I tried to keep my distance, but she just looked at me.

I’m very insecure and don’t like comments about my appearance, even compliments. She knew this, and despite being drunk, she started talking about my femininity and delicate nature. She said I was “dainty” in a way that felt sincere. The way she spoke made me feel so special. I couldn’t believe a drunk person could say such heartfelt things without meaning them.

As she talked, she moved closer until she was leaning on my shoulder, smelling me. I wear a lot of perfume daily and use countless scented products. She mentioned this as she leaned in. Then, she slowly unzipped the jacket to my lower abdomen, placed her hands on my ribs, and kissed my neck and torso—never my chest. I’m very sensitive about touch and was initially uncomfortable, but nothing she did felt inappropriate. It was soft, deliberate, and respectful in its own way. Her kisses on my abdomen and ribs made me hyperventilate. For a moment, I almost fainted.

Eventually, she picked me up again and left me in her closet with her clothes, telling me to change. I didn’t like it but had no choice. When the rain stopped, she drove me home in her truck, putting my bike in the back. After that, I avoided talking to her for about a week because I was so overwhelmed. She eventually came to my house and stayed over one night.

The next day, I had invited some elderly women I play tennis with at a club. I told her I was going shopping for the lunch—an excuse because I love shopping. She didn’t bring up what had happened, and I didn’t either. I gave her breakfast and then took her shopping. I bought her high-waisted blue pants, a soft fabric belt, and a loose white silk shirt with buttons. Meanwhile, I bought about seven dresses and several pairs of heels. Later, some elderly ladies mistook her for my boyfriend because of her androgynous style and height.

That evening, we had a well you know sophisticated dinner. Afterward, we visited a paid-entry garden (capitalism, ugh).And you know, in the car, I didn’t do anything. I just smoked. She obviously noticed, so she asked me about it. I didn’t want to tell her, but she pulled over to the side of the road and confronted me. And you know, I started crying in a millisecond—almost screaming—and told her about it. Not everything I was feeling, but mostly about what she did and how she couldn’t just do that and then ignore it or pretend it didn’t happen. Even though it wasn’t explicit, I basically confessed part of my feelings for her.

She was shocked, lol. She told me she had been super drunk and didn’t remember anything, saying she was sorry for making me feel that way. She insisted it wasn’t her intention and that she didn’t want me to see things the wrong way. She explained that when she’s drunk, she says things randomly without thinking. BUT LIKE, HOW CAN SHE SAY THAT? HOW CAN SHE DO THAT? It *HAS* to mean something—UGH.

Anyway, after the car incident, we went to the garden, and I calmed down a little. But obviously, I went home completely devastated. I didn’t want to talk to her after that.

When I say I didn’t want to talk to her, I mean for a few days. We’re talking normally now, but our ""visits"" have decreased because neither of us brings it up. But, you know, it really bothers me. I think it traumatized me a little. Recently, she’s been texting and calling me a lot, and I don’t know what to do. Oh, and by the way, I know her dad was also an alcoholic and emotionally distant, while her mom was normal but conservative. So I assume she might be closeted? I don't know but the whole situation is overwhelming me. 

So Do you think there are real feelings behind it or just confusion and me being delusional?

So, grab your coffee (or preferred testing fuel) and let's dive in

1. **AI-Powered Everything:** This isn't just hype anymore. AI is revolutionizing testing, from generating test cases and optimizing test suites to analyzing results and predicting defects. Tools like \[mention specific tools if you know any relevant ones, otherwise keep it generic\] are becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing us to test faster and smarter. If you're not upskilling in AI/ML related testing techniques, now's the time.
2. **Shift-Left and Beyond:** Shift-left is old news. We're talking shift-everywhere! Testing is becoming more integrated throughout the entire SDLC, from design to deployment and beyond. This requires testers to be more collaborative and have a deeper understanding of the development process. Think DevTestOps, continuous testing, and in-sprint testing.
3. **The Rise of the Citizen Tester:** With the increasing complexity of software, we need all hands on deck. Citizen testing, or crowdsourced testing, is gaining traction, allowing organizations to leverage the power of their user base to identify bugs and improve quality. This requires a shift in mindset and new strategies for managing and validating feedback.
4. **Focus on Non-Functional Testing:** Performance, security, accessibility - these are no longer afterthoughts. As software becomes more critical to our daily lives, non-functional testing is taking center stage. Expect to see increased demand for testers with expertise in these areas. Tools specializing in performance engineering and security testing will become even more crucial.
5. **The Metaverse and Beyond:** The digital landscape is expanding rapidly, with the metaverse, AR/VR, and other immersive technologies becoming mainstream. Testing these experiences presents unique challenges, requiring new tools and methodologies. Think about testing for user experience, immersion, and interoperability in virtual worlds.

My advice? Embrace change, be proactive, and never stop learning. The testing landscape is constantly evolving, and the only way to stay ahead is to stay curious and adapt.

What are your thoughts? What trends are you seeing? Let's discuss in the comments!

Bonus Question: What skills do you think will be most in-demand for testers in 2025?

Their [Paraiso 92 pink bourbon](https://archive.ph/aN0Ne) was something truly special. The [Berg Wu selection](https://archive.ph/WWGzR) was also one of my favorites this year.

But here’s the thing: all their Geshas seem to suck.

I tried this [Eleta multistage fermentation](https://archive.ph/cI5xT), and it was disgustingly funky—like burnt rubber. And I *usually* appreciate funk more than most people. But this? Unbearable.

Then there’s the washed and natural Geshas. I’ve had a few ([Santa Felisa](https://archive.ph/6mo9c), [CGLE](https://archive.ph/Z4FBW), [Gesha Village](https://archive.ph/JPiiP), and [Waliki Coconatural](https://archive.ph/w0C59)), and they all taste the same: empty, cardboard, a faint hint of strawberry, and that’s it. No sweetness, no acidity, no complexity. Just... bland. I even tried blind cupping them, and they all still tasted the same.

I know they’ve had some [stellar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9aCG9i9mos) [reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iWVjs5o7Hw) on Coffee Reviews, but is anyone else experiencing the same consistency problems with them?

This might be a longshot ([Hanlon’s razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) and all that), but I can’t help feeling like I’m the victim of a bait-and-switch here. How can all these Geshas from such diverse terroirs all suck in exactly the same way? It doesn’t add up, and it’s seriously disappointing given how great Wes Ngopi can be with other coffees.

She messaged me on fb with self deleting photo of herself in the bath which she's never done, she's never sent anything even semi nude before and was dead against that. Told me she was testing the self deleting feature. So far not really thinking anything but she is taking about a guy from our running club a lot and often messaging him, but nothing wrong with that.

A few days later I'm at work and happen to check our family tracking app, to see where she's out running after seeing she's left home and she's out an hours drive into the countryside on a river walk, I actually thought it was a GPS glitch as she doesn't drive and was meant to be spending the day with her son, my stepson, who was home. So I sent her a screenshot of the app with a question mark and laughing emoji and she replied saying she's on a last minute unplanned trip to do photography with this guy, (who is a photographer, which she is interested in). So far fair play but she sent me a photo of her holding the camera wearing his coat! Again nothing too bad but I'm not exactly happy cause she'd usually tell me about something fun like that, we chat a lot about everything usually so seems odd, especially his motivations fire driving her so far out for photos when he drives a fuel hungry motor home everywhere.

That night she was at the running club and i see she is being given a lift home, he's often given her a lift back and me too if i attend and weather is bad but I get a feeling and do something I've never done and read their chat history. Lots of love hearts, kisses, turns out the nature walk and photography was pre planned, included coffee. Messages about him kissing her all over etc and her reply was very accepting. Few unsent messages amongst it but it's clearly not just friendship and has been going on for some time.

So before they got home I was super angry and turned my location off and went to my parents house to have a coffee and calm down and try to work out what to do. Didn't want to see him or her... So finally here's my reaction and how things are going... i asked her about it all as calmly as i could starting with the trip out... again she just said it was spur of the moment, denied anything else until i said i know, i read the messages. She tried saying it was all him, but that just isn't true. She very quickly deleted their chat history, blocked him, swore to quit running club and never speak to him again.

So I've stayed with her two nights now. Ive told my parents as i have nobody else really to talk to right now and they offered for me to stay there but I'm trying to work things out, especially since its the festive season and we always do new years eve activities with my stepson and i dont want him knowing something is up!

I'm strugling with how i feel and knowing what to do, but for now im playing happy families, just without the intimacy, hugs only.  she tried to kiss me on the lips at midnight newyears and i didnt have chance to move away or anything and just said ""you've got some cheek but i guess its newyears after all"" now she's very upset, didn't want to come to bed, thinks i dont want her etc. eventually came to bed and cried herself to sleep. I've only slept a few hours each night, i just can't sleep, im just so, so sad, feel like i have lost her, like she's not the same person.

Do i give myself a talking to and man up and forget it ever happened?

  
sorry it's so long but i wanted to be as detailed as possible and my sleep deprived brain is not concice, i guess.

* I started my new medication today 
* Took pups for a walk in the drizzly rain which was nice but my shoes are sopping wet now as I got yanked into a puddle by that menace of a dog 
* Read my book 
* Looked at stuff to buy online like the coffee machine and got progressively more and more overwhelmed 
* Considered doing something productive several times 
* Decided against doing any productive several times 
* Made a spicy bean wrap thing with avocado, cucumber, cheese, hot sauce and coriander - delightful. 
* Played with pups and carried him around as I do everyday, he loves when I pick him up and carry him around on my hip like a baby, maybe because he’s a baby? But also I think he likes being high up. 
* Missed him. Why do I miss him so quick after spending hours with him last night? 
* I think I’ll go home on Friday with mum to pick up some bits and pieces as back to work next week (ugh). I need my work stuff, my crocs so I can walk into the river with pups and not kill my feet, a new tube of moisturiser and I want the two FW books to perhaps start rereading as the third comes out this month. I don’t even like them much I don’t think? But I’m still invested? Am I that easily ensnared by dragons and hot shadow wielding men? It seems so? But also I loveeee the dragons.

Even for simple transactions like buying coffee, using crypto can be needlessly complicated. Let’s cut to the chase.

I’m building a **Super Social Network**—a platform designed to redefine how we interact online. It features autonomous democratic systems, innovative moderation tools, and seamless cryptocurrency integration for legal, everyday use, with plans for even richer functionality in the future.

In today’s AI-driven world, the platform tackles challenges like oversaturated low-quality content and keeps bots out entirely. By using algorithmic rate-limiting and a tiered account verification system, it ensures high-quality content gains visibility while reducing costs. It also provides creators with significantly higher earning potential and allows them to reach more people without unnecessary barriers.

This idea has been in development for over 10 years, with the last 10+ months dedicated to active research, design, and coding. The goal is to launch the project successfully by late Q1 or early Q2 of 2025. If, as a reasonable person, this text-based explanation hasn’t convinced you (which is entirely fair), you can be among the first to gain access once the project’s MVP is complete.

I don’t have a proven background or flashy degrees—just enthusiasm and hard work. I tried to write this post in a more professional tone, but it felt forced and lost its meaning, so here I am, writing it this way.

Right now, I’m working with a limited budget and need an investment. There are plenty of ways to raise funds, but I refuse to share my startup for peanuts. That’s not the only reason—I value direct, meaningful conversations over unnecessary bureaucracy or endless negotiations.

Please look at this market: countless memecoins with no usage, no benefits, and no future dominate, yet they have billions in market cap. This is the reality of crypto today.

I’m considering an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), but it doesn’t necessarily have to be tied to a coin I create. Launching and listing a new token can be tedious. If you already have a listed token or network, I’m open to working with it. Limited supply is my preference for security and value, but I’m open to other strategies if your project operates differently.

**Here’s what I want:**

* To negotiate directly with a token or network owner and raise investments from people.
* Alternatively, launch a new token in exchange for investment.
* I’m open to hearing your ideas and exploring alternative approaches to achieve these goals.

I’m fully aware of the grants available in the crypto space. As I said, I find them insufficient and overly bureaucratic—Plan B at best. Venture capital? That’s Plan C.

I need an investor willing to take a risk, someone who sees the potential to build something big with a high ROI. Let me be clear: This isn’t about the money for me. it’s just the fuel. I’m looking for someone who believes in building long-term value, not just chasing short-term profits.

2nd of all, chappell roan is NOT the kind of music i usually listen to, but curiosity got the best of me and i queued up the album in the flair next to motley crue and my performance increased exponentially whenever some specific songs came on the playlist, i swear i've never played like that in a long while, and maybe the fact that i can vibe to the song because i'm playing by myself can be also a determining factor, but i find the ""her music gives me powers"" a lot more amusing

i just think the mental image of a shitter like me becoming somewhat competent because the funny redhead is talking about coffee among other things is really amusing, specially when they're fighting with a straight face for their lives in a game where you die and die all over again.

1hqxdmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1hqxdmj/vegas_25_trip_report/,Vegas $2/5 Trip Report,"I'm a recreational player with \~4 years of experience both online and live.

Every Christmas holiday, I visit Vegas to play poker and hang out. It was my 4th year this time. I was there from Dec 22th to 31st and played $2/5 the whole time at different rooms, ran well and made about $3,900. 

Here's my experience of the different poker rooms I played during this trip:

*  Wynn
   * $1.5/hr comp, \~4-6 tables running
   * IMO sleekest poker room in Vegas (but games aren't great)
   * Lots of regs, with most players were playing deep. They are super tight, even at late night (talking about 2am and later)
   * In general, people know what they are doing so they rarely punt. This isn't to say they are good or aggressive, they just wouldn't call off a big bet with random hands
   * There was a group of Japanese players visiting. I changed the table immediately if I spotted more than 2 at my table. They are tight, don't give action/help with my profit
* Venetian
   * I liked their $3/hr comp and free soft drink + coffee station
   * New room at Palazzo, which was almost as clean as Wynn
   * More recs than the Wynn but there weren't that many $3/5 tables running (Max I've seen is 3? Typically they had 2 tables)
   * Games were softer than Wynn but the wait was longer given # of table running and table change opportunity was limited
   * I wasn't a huge fan of double board PLO bomb pot every dealer change (lots of chopped pots and took a lot of time. But if this is your edge, I can see how you can leverage this game format)
* Bellagio
   * $2/hr comp, \~6 tables running
   * This is the only $2/5 game on the strip with $500 buy in now that Caesars is temporarily closed but that invites lots of recs who are scared to buy in for $1,000+
   * The 100BB cap facilitates action because people get pot committed/stacked easily. The game gets going after people buy in for a few times
   * Softest $2/5 game on the Strip with lots of limp and multiway pots. You can just play ABC poker and profit from their mistakes / bet when you have strong hands
   * Basically all my profit came from Bellagio to my surprise. I thought due to $500 max, it wasn't going to be profitable but the player pool more than compensates for the cap. My intention was to grind it out at the Wynn but I regret spending my time there early on tbh
* Impressions
   * Players are massively imbalanced (incl. me). Their betting range is strong and checking range is really weak
   * Really tight and linear 3 bet range, 4bets were always strong hands. If you play online, you need to make some pre-flop range tweaks
   * Post flop, you can put pressure on capped ranges heads up, but it gest much harder on multiway pots
   * Didn't really see lots of bluffs, esp in multiway pots
   * Table selection was extremely important to my profit. Proactively change tables and look for people who look like recs. Also look at how many people are logged-in/not. You want a table full of ""guests""
   * Players cbet too frequently, you can raise vs. this range, but the double barrel range becomes much stronger than GTO

I was already in a bad mood. We've had issues of infidelity in our past and major trust issues. I started the fight. I was going off about other girls and how he was complaining about spending too much time with our baby. Which he doesn't work I do so it makes sense that he watches her while I'm away. I told him I didn't wanna come over. He wanted me to bring him food from my job. Side memo he has trapped me at his home before with threats because I currently drive his car. The threats go along the lines of if I leave he will report the car stolen. I come into the house and put the food down he askes me what my attitude is about. I don't remember exactly what I said but I do know it ended up with me going out to the living room by myself. Sitting on the couch and trying to avoid him. He walks out of the room and lays 500 dollars of my money torn in half next to me on the coffee table. I flip I tell him I am going to call the police. After I said that he grabbed my phone and yanked me off the couch with it. I gave up for the night at that point and attempted just laying on the couch with a couple pillows and a blanket by myself. He ripped the blanket off me and pulled the pillows out from under my head. I was emotionally distraught over what happened and wasn't thinking correctly. So I went into his room and tried taking his phone from him so i could get anyone to give me a ride out. He was laying on his stomach with the phone in front of him. I reached over his left shoulder and tried snatching it. As I did that he flung his elbow back hard and hit me in the face. I had a very large goose egg at the time and the whole left side of my face swelled up. He claimed it was an accident. I was done at that point I was going to leave to walk to the gas station and call the police. As i was walking across the lawn he grabbed me and dragged me about 10ft in the snow/sleat. I was able to get up but lost a shoe. He took it and threw it about 20ft away in the snow. I threatened to go straight to the police if my phone wasn't returned. So he gave it back to me. I walked back in the house and was completely done with him. Just sat at the table by myself crying looking in the mirror at my goose egg. He came over trying to be all nice and wanting to make up for it. I told him to just leave me alone. He wouldn't take no for an answer and cradle style picked me up. He walked about 5 ft and dropped me onto hard wood floors he said it was an accident. There was another point in the night where he was chasing me and I tripped over a child sized for wheeler in the living room.... I woke up the next day feeling like I'd gotten hit by a truck. And he kept my torn up money. I threatened to call the police the next day if he didn't return it. So he did. And he dropped the car off to me. So the next couple of days were very hard. Covering my black eye with make up. Seeing new bruises forming from swollen parts of my leg. My ankle was very sore as well from the incident and I had a very large bruise on my right hip. I assume that was the 4 wheeler. But he claims these were all ""accidents"" and I honestly think next time he will kill me. 
So day 3 I called. I made a statement similar to the one I just gave. I was slightly intoxicated during this incident. I told them the truth. I told them to the best of my knowledge what had happened and I told them he said they were accidents. I'm not justifying him. He already has one dv against me from a time when he had grabbed my hoodie by the collar and dragged me across a bed with it in turn choking me out. We were both intoxicated during this one. Then the apple bees incident. He claimed he just wanted to talk but when we walked into the restaraunt he very loudly kept calling me a whore. So I got up and left. I walked out the back door and he followed me trying to grabbing for my phone. I wouldn't let it go he kept pulling and pulling at me and I started to scream for him to let me go. The police were called I claimed nothing happened. That we just got into a verbal fight. 
I'm mentally drained physically exhausted from these incidents. I'm so tired of being a narsasists pawn and I don't think he will change. 
The police tried contacting him and he hid in his house with his mother claiming I was intoxicated coming into the home. Claiming she didn't see anything. Well I think she heard and saw a lot more than she claims. 
Well now he is offering me money and a lot like 10k by the end of winter and 40k by the end of the year. He says he will get it in writing and notorized. If I just lie and say I fell and I had caught him cheating. I should say thats why I made up the story. He says i can use his texts that he bribed me if he doesnt follow through and say that I was scard of him doing something if i didnt take the bribe. And to be honest I am scard of him and I know I'm never gonna see compensation for my pain. My phone is connected to his mother's account, I sold my car to help his business so the only vehicle i can use is his. I'm staying with my mother but she wants me out by feb 15th. I have an eviction so I can't get a loan. Is it possible to take the bribe? Is it a good idea? Will there be reprimand on my part? Would this even work? Should I have a lawyer involved if i take it? Or should I just have him go to prison for 5 years or more since this is his 3rd dv? What do I do reddit?",0,1735713006.0,legaladvice,2,0.33,False

This one will be a bit of a long read, so strap in and get your coffee (sorry)

2025 will mark the 25th anniversary of the franchise, can you guys believe that Deus Ex will  be a quarter century old this year! Time flies 🤯


And since you only get to celebrate your 25th birthday once in your entire life, let's try to make this one as special as we can.


I want to dedicate this thread to reflect on the ""Deus Ex Experience"" each and every one of us has gone through, what is Deus Ex to you? How long have you been a fan of the series? What keeps you coming back?


The Deus Ex adventure is full of twists and turns. We all know the current situation of the series is poor, but I want to keep such negativity out of this thread, let's please try that 🙏 


2025 is a moment of happiness for Deus Ex after all.

Now speaking of myself, I'm a relatively new fan to the series, I was introduced to Deus Ex in 2018 or 2017 iirc, believe it or not, but I was quickly dismissive of Deus Ex, my first contact with Deus Ex was through watching gameplay footage of Mankind Divided but it didn't leave a lasting impression on me, in fact i didnt like it (which is funny considering it is now my favorite Deus Ex game), but there are 2 reasons for that;

the first one being is that at this point in my life gaming was more of a ""secondary hobby"", I didnt delve much into games as whole due to busy educational life, which leads to the second reason which is I was not into first person games at the time, I preferred the third person perspective of story driven games as I liked to see my character in action, but as the years go by, one's tastes and preferences change, altering what we like or how we like it. 


And what you know, a bunch of months later I got sick and during my recovery process I decided to kill the time by watching some trailers on YouTube, and what do you know, Deus Ex Human Revolution trailer was there... and boy it got me hooked! I saw in Adam Jensen a bit of what I was going through at that point in my life, a man fighting alone to overcome the obstacles thrown at him.


Now to save the time, Long story short, after this, I started digging more into the series, it opened a new world to me, it shaped how perceive the world around me, politics, corporate greed, technology and yada yada. And this kind of influence keeps brining me back.


One thing I wish it does not go away tho, is my love for Deus Ex, I hope I never lose interest in the series or for it to fizzle out in the background of my life, I want to keep hanging on.

","my sister and I have always been so close, like back to back best friends kind of thing, and ever since our family life god bad, we've always had eachothers backs. she was like my favorite person, and still is. 

a little background on her is that she has always been a very secretitive person. she wouldn't tell me much about her life, or her friends (id know their names and little stories but thats it), she didn't like people in her room, she didn't like people knowing what she brought from stores, she didn't like people knowing what music she listened to etc. but she'd always tell me to do hauls or what i did or how was my day, and idk if this is because ive always been the louder one but yk.  
she moved out around a year ago and i'd text her almost daily, just basically annoying her w reels n tiktoks n stuff like that n ramble on bout my day and shed just reply or ignore for a day or so. even if i asked about her life it was brief and short. i also was not allowed to see photos of her, take photos of her or be in any of her social medias. even tho she followed me, knew what i was doing etc.   
around a over a year back she had an eating disorder, and struggled alot, she 'recovered' i think, I didn't really know bc she was, as i said, secretitive, and i think my dad 'helped' her or was trying and u could visibly see she didnt like i t. during then shed tell me how shes just naturally skinny, (she isn't, growing up she was always ""bigger"" than me. I was the lanky one and she was the well built one, in a goodhealthy way.) she also said that, i quote, ""dad thinks i have an eating disorder, but i don't, like thats not good for you."" but it was obv she did. she moved out and started to not throw it up but clearly was eating ver yless. she would avoid bread, rice, heavy foods, n started eating so much berries and drink excessive coffee/tea (idk if thats related or not but id like to know).  
recently in the morning we'd have bread or rice w smth n we had rice. we have three bowls, and i was planning on eating some for lunch as well. I put my portion on a plate, and went out for a driving lesson. she, put her bit of rice, and put it onto my plate. and i could tell she did because it was to the rim, and i dont eat that much naturally. i asked her ""did u put rice on my plate"" and she goes ""no?"" inthe lying tone, and i knew she was lying. i said okay and went back to my room n shut my door. ever since then we have not spoke to one another and she ignores my messages. also a note that when we had bread, she was eating bread and i was eating rice, because i prefeered it more, the bread wouldnt lessen. n shed make me these sandwhiches for lunch. (im assuming to get rid of breadn to not let it look like shes not eating any), and then i asked her ""r u eating bread?"" n she got very irritated.   
today she switched from bread to rice n eats such a small portion. whenever i say i skipped a meal or worked out alot she'd excessively tell me ""make sure to eat"" or ""dont work out too much its not good for you"". which really irritated me because why r u putting ur portion onto my plate, and telling me  to do this and that when u cant even do it yourself. I don't like how she makes me working out seem like a ""bad thing"", when she doesn't even eat.   
I think another reason i get annoyed that she doesn't eat is because i think that ""if she doesn't have to eat, then why do i have to"", or that its a angry caringness for her but idk which one it is.   
also a note that once my sister gets angry at smth she never lets it go, and can go without talking to that person for the rest of her life. I have watched her do it to others and i am kind of sad that it might be me next. I do miss the friendship we had, she was the closest person to me, but sometimes (i used to think, and still do now), wonder why she knew so much about me and my life and asked about it when she would tell me absolutely nothing about hers. I can't even see her photos or her socials.   
Why is she like this? and what should I do? Am I in the wrong? and if so, please feel free to criticize harshly and tell me things I can do to be a better person. ",1,1735712285.0,FriendshipAdvice,3,1.0,False
