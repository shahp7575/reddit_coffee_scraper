1hypm8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sororities/comments/1hypm8h/winter_cob_feeling_discouraged/,Winter COB feeling discouraged,"I made a post on this subreddit a few days ago basically explaining my situation as junior transfer who dropped out of primary recruitment in the fall and decided to participate in COB. I signed up for three out of the four chapters and didn‚Äôt recover bids for two. The first chapter held a round over FaceTime during winter break and I didn‚Äôt get a bid but the conversation was very awkward. Additionally, the active that I talked to straight up told me that she had no idea how COB worked which I thought was off putting. Today, the second chapter had the first round of their COB process where I talked to three girls. The first girl that I talked to formed a great connection because we are both from the same area, danced growing up, and I loved talking to her. I thought I had good conversations with the other two girls.

The third chapter starts their COB process next week with coffee dates and then a sisterhood event followed by bid day next Sunday. I made it to philanthropy round for this chapter during primary recruitment but was not asked to back to pref. Looking back, I think it‚Äôs because of something I said to one of the actives during our conversation. I really liked this chapter and was very disappointed when I didn‚Äôt get asked back for pref. 

After not receiving bids twice during COB, I‚Äôm starting to feel discouraged and wondering if there‚Äôs something really off about me. I want to be apart of a sorority since I genuinely do want to be apart of a sisterhood and find my community and I think being in one would add a lot of value to my life. However, I think this would be my last chance to join one since I will be a senior in the fall and I don‚Äôt know if spring COB will happen. Recruitment and COB has taught me a lot but I just want a good outcome instead of being told that xyz chapter can only hand out limited bids and that I would be a great addition to another chapter.

1hypfor,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1hypfor/trees_part_one/,Trees (part one?),"I am writing this here hoping to find some answers explaining my late fathers recent passing. After we found out that he had been cheating on our mother years ago among a slew of other things amounting to having a second family, we had basically cut ties with him altogether.I have not communicated with him since my senior year of highschool, almost a decade ago. I hadn't thought of him in years when a few months ago I got a call from someone informing me he had kicked the bucket.

As some strange way of trying to reconcile with us, my father had left everything he had owned to me and my sister, Robin. Robin tragically died a few years back in a drunk driving accident while in grad-school. She would have been a lawyer. That left me as the sole heir to my fathers inheritance. Turns out, life had not treated him so well in the years since he had left our family. His other family didn't take too kindly to my fathers antics once they heard from Robin who tracked them down on social media and informed them of his double life.

My father had been living alone for the majority of the last nine and a half years and had become somewhat of a shut-in. He had moved out to the middle of nowhere Washington, among the trees and sticks and lived an exceedingly solitary life, which is why it was so strange when he was found in the woods bordering his house, a mile away, with almost every bone in his body broken and bent at odd angles.His body was found by two middle age hunters who had been spotlighting that night and were unfortunate enough to come across this gruesome visual. My fathers body sprawled out, head facing up, his torso twisted around under the ribcage so that his hips were front side down and the skin around his waist was twisted and pulled tight, almost breaking. His left knee went the wrong way, his right ankle spun so that his foot was backwards, his leg bone broke the skin in some places, matching his arms and a couple of ribs so that his body formed a grizzly, crumpled mass of flesh, blood, and bone-spikes.

The hunters ran back in the way they came out of pure instinctual fear and adrenaline on seeing this cruel display of a violent end. When they reached a point where their phone had a signal one of them contacted law enforcement and alerted them to the situation. When the investigators arrived, the sun was just beginning to rise and a cool blue morning light dimly illuminated the scene through the trees. No one could make any sense of what had happened. It was clear to them via autopsy that he had only been dead for a couple of days at the point of being discovered. For some inexplicable reason,plants and grass had already begun to grow, wrapping his body. There was no rational explanation. The leading theory was that my sixty year old,unfit, father had scaled a very tall tree and flung himself down with enough force to do that amount of damage to himself, or that someone had done this to him and then carried his six foot, two hundred fifty pound body a mile into the woods and placed him here. There were no dragging or tire marks anywhere around the area. Animals had been ruled out because of the fact that there wasn‚Äôt a single bite mark or claw mark anywhere on his body. It was utterly dumbfounding to everyone who witnessed it.

The woods around his body seemed slightly unsettling to investigators and law enforcement who spent time there. Everything seemed very manicured and deliberate. The trees seemed too evenly spaced, the leaves and pine needles covered the ground too well. There was no breeze. Nothing moved. Above all there was a distinct, noticeable, silence, the only sound you could hear was your breath and the sound of your footsteps on soft earth.
			*	*	*	*	*

When I heard that my inheritance included his house in the mountains, I planned on going there in a couple of months with some friends of mine from my auto technician school whom I had kept up with after I finished school. I was planning on having a good time hiking, drinking, and sitting around a fire dicking around.

Joey was five foot eleven inches and lanky. He had been going through a tough time dealing with some personal problems that I had been trying to help him through, even though we live halfway across the country from each other now. When he met me at the cabin, I noticed he looked like he lost some weight recently and my heart sank. When he moved away our other friends hadn't really stayed in touch like we did and he didn't have an easy time making new friends in the city he moved to. Making new friends as an adult is hard. He showed up around 11:00 and I offered him a drink.

We walked into the living room, it was still mostly unfurnished as I had thrown out most of my dead father‚Äôs old stuff. There was an old worn leather couch facing the fireplace, a dark wooden coffee table, a large accent chair matching the couch, a few stools lined up next to the bar dividing the kitchen from the living room, and a medium sized T.V. sat over the hearth. The cabin was dimly lit with warm light. My dog that I had brought with me from home, a Great Dane named Rosie, curled up on the couch, seizing half of it for herself. I walked over to the kitchen while Joey sat down and perused the liquor cabinet the old bastard had left to me. It seemed like one of the only things he had cared to spend money on and there was a costly selection at my disposal along with some nice crystal glasses. 

‚ÄúHey man, what's your poison of choice?‚Äô‚Äù I asked, looking over the array of options.

‚ÄúGot any tequila in there?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah, don‚Äôt know too much about tequila and there's a couple of kinds in here so you should come take your pick.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI'm a bourbon man myself.‚Äù

Joey looked over the bottles, found one to his liking, and pulled it down. We took our glasses and bottles over to the couch and drank and caught up for a while before calling it a night as Joey had gotten in pretty late and the others weren‚Äôt expected until tomorrow.

Daniel arrived late the next morning, waking us up by banging on the door. I made my way down the stairs quickly as his knocking sounded frantic and forceful.

‚ÄúFuck, man, I‚Äôm coming.‚Äù I shouted, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, ‚ÄúJesus, what's his deal?‚Äù I muttered to myself.

I reached the door and opened it to the continuous sound of his pounding on the door. Daniel, usually confident and unfazed, stood there disheveled and frightened looking, especially so because of his small frame. He was dirty, wearing blue jeans and a ripped white tee shirt that accentuated each dirt and grass stain on it. 

‚ÄúHoly shit man what happened to you?‚ÄùI asked, ‚Äúand where is Sarah?‚Äù his girlfriend wasn't with him.

‚ÄúI don't know‚Ä¶ where‚Ä¶ she is,‚Äù he stammered between panicked breaths,‚ÄùThe car‚Ä¶ there was a deer‚Ä¶ Sarah was driving‚Ä¶ we crashed into the woods.‚Äù

‚Äú The trees just‚Ä¶ closed in on us.‚Äù he said, questioning his own words.

Over the next ten minutes I managed to get the story out of him. Sarah had been driving with him in the passenger seat of his little Ford Fiesta when a deer jumped out from nowhere in front of the car. His girlfriend had swerved to avoid the deer and lost control, sending them off the road, down the steep embankment and into the woods. Somehow the car traveled miraculously far into the woods and hit a tree that seemed to knock Sarah unconscious. Daniel tried to get around to the other side of the car to try and see if he could drive it away but when he reached the other side there were bushes blocking his way to the door. He decided to run for help when he swears the plants in the forest tried to stop him. Trees bent down and branches reached for him, the bushes seemed to grow in his way and yank at his clothing and skin. He had left his cell phone in the car so he came straight here to call for help.

I gave him my phone to call an ambulance and woke up Joey. I relayed the story to him but said that I figured he had hit his head pretty hard in the crash and that the stuff with the plants was probably some kind of concussed hallucination. We all left to head down the road to the spot that Daniel said that the crash happened to flag down the ambulance when it came up the road.

When we got there I could see the Fiesta from the road and told them I would go to check on Sarah. Daniel protested and told me not to go in there but Joey and I told him it was going to be okay and I argued that they could see me from where they were standing while I made my way there.

I made my way down the steep roadside into the lush forest. I could see the Fiesta in front of me but something about it seemed off. It was silent in the woods.

‚ÄúSarah?‚Äù I shouted, making my way to the car.

There was no response. As I reached the car I slowed as a deep unsettling feeling washed over me. The car was covered in plant life as if it had been there for months. I walked to the side of the car and pulled the door open, ripping vines and moss from its way. 

Sarah wasn‚Äôt inside.

I asked if I could have brown sugar, because brown sugar is healthier than white sugar and I have been taking that for years.

The waitress gave me a strange look, she was giving me a ""why are you taking brown sugar with your coffee?"" vibe. Anyway, 10 minutes elapsed and the brown sugar never came, so I asked another waitress if there was brown sugar, and two minutes later, my brown sugar came. I tipped the other waitress who gave me my order and I didn't tip the first waitress, my brother tipped her, but I didn't, because she made me feel bad for ordering brown sugar.

I would understand if brown sugar wasn't available, but it was available, and the other waitress had no issues with me ordering and giving me my brown sugar, so why the issue?

On Yahoo! Answers years ago, I asked this question and was criticized for my choice, saying that I should just have white sugar with my coffee and I made it hard for the waitress because brown sugar, while available, is all the way in the back, so I made the job for the waitress harder and I was criticized for not tipping the first waitress.

I consider myself to be very easygoing when it comes to possessions in that eat/use/do anything you want with my stuff. I'd be really hard pressed to think of something my partner could use of mine that would get me upset or annoyed.  
My partner on the other hand gives much more importance to her possessions. I had unknowingly (nearly) finished a bag of coffee she had been saving up since September, and when she realized she was hurt that I didn't ask her if I could use it.  
Internally, I had several different reactions to her being upset.  
First was feeling bad I let her down. I wouldn't have taken it if I knew it meant something to her.  
Second was a kind of exasperation , it's not the first time I consume or use something that annoys her, and I just feel like her house is a maze of rules that I'll never be able to fully crack, and so I start second guessing whether I can touch anything at all.  
Third is slightly hurt, though this feeling is a bit unfair to her as she's allowed to have her own disposition, but I just kept thinking there's literally nothing she could do to my things that I would actually care about because my love for her trumps whatever thing she might touch or sorting system she doesn't abide by, so why can't she offer the same attitude?

At its core, I think she grew up enjoying the finer things in life and doesn't mind spending extra money if it means she will get more out of them, which I think explains her reactions since she works hard to get what she has and having someone take it away or mishandle it makes her feel like I don't respect her property and therefore the time and effort she put into her things.  
Meanwhile, I really need very little things to be happy and will usually take whatever is cheaper as long as it does the job well. 

We had a little discussion about it after the incident and I suggested I could simply bring my own snacks and coffee to her place, but honestly that solution still wouldn't negate that feeling of hurt if I'm honest. Plus I feel that I'll always be walking on eggshells about where I put the dishes, or how I hang her clothes, or any number of things with unwritten rules. She answered that I'm making her feel like she's stingy and difficult, but I know her and she's very generous with her money with me and it's just that she's peculiar about her stuff. Obviously I don't think telling her to get over this is a solution either because that's just a recipe to build internal resentment. I'm just trying to find a path for us.

I'll start off with my original Journey, I grew up chubby until I was about 16 years old, then throughout high school I went on a healthy eating plan worked out here and there and got to a decent weight. when I was 18 years old I went from about 160 pounds to about 250 pounds in 2 1/2 to 3 years. Eventually I realized enough is enough, I followed a strict diet eating about 1000 cal a day, and over the course of six months I lost all the weight and got down to about 185 pounds. I was also lifting weights in the gym and I am still consistently lifting weights, and have been for approximately three years now with no more than one week off about once every 4 months and on average five days a week of working out. Back in Feb 2024 I decided that I want to cut down further and see what it's like to be shredded, I went on a ketogenic diet and in about two months I hit 157.4 pounds. I felt great, looked amazing and was happy at that weight. 

These are where the problems hit, from April 2024, to current date I now weigh 210 pounds. So somehow I managed to gain 50 pounds in eight months, simply eating what I figured to be a normal day of eating, yes I would snack here and there but I still stick to mainly water for drinks and black coffee, with the occasional Diet Coke.

I am once again starting a diet to get this weight off once and for all because I'm sick and tired of living like this .

I am here asking for tips and help on #1, the best dieting plan that will not extremely slow down my metabolism and #2, once I have this weight off for a third time, what steps can I take to ensure that this completely unnecessary weight gain never happens again.

For some background info
I'm 25, Male, have a very respectable muscular physique, I've always preferred aggressive dieting over a slight defecit, I found it much more successful than me personally, as I am OK on a day-to-day basis eating very little food. With my current job I average around 3000+ steps per day and I currently work out 5 to 6 days a week 60 minutes of weight training with the occasional cardio. Due to my situation I'm unable to cook at home a lot, though I have meal prepped in the past. I do eat out quite a bit but I tend to stick with the healthier options. 

I want to get this weight off and keep it off, while still being able to go out eat with friends and enjoy my life without blowing up like a balloon.

1hyp1ln,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1hyp1ln/just_finished_taking_online_test_in_japan/,Just finished taking online test in Japan,"I‚Äôve been using this subreddit as a resource while studying for the pump exam. Hopefully, it‚Äôs behind me now, but I‚Äôm still waiting for my official results.

I started studying for the exam casually at the beginning of 2024 using AR‚Äôs Udemy course. Toward the end, I added the Third Rock notes and Study Hall to my prep. Since I live in Japan, I registered to take the exam online, and unlike in the U.S., the test was administered by ATA based in Beijing.

The process was similar to what I‚Äôve seen described on this sub, but with a few major differences. First, the test was conducted in Japanese, though English translations were available. As a native English speaker, I was concerned about how accurate the translations would be, but they were well-written and aligned with what I‚Äôd seen in Study Hall. However, using the translations was a bit tedious. Each question required clicking a ‚Äútranslation‚Äù button, which opened the English text in a separate window. You couldn‚Äôt select answers in the translation window, so you had to toggle back to the Japanese version to choose your answer. While the order of the answers was the same, this added extra time and could be frustrating if you frequently review your answers. I chose not to review my answers at all‚Äîpartly because i did not want to waste extra time and I tend to second-guess myself and make unnecessary changes.

Another difference was the need for a second camera. ATA required a second-angle camera (e.g., a phone or other device) positioned at a 45-degree angle behind you and linked to the monitoring feed. I had to buy a stand for my phone since it would have been awkward to manage otherwise.

I thought I had connected my computer via Ethernet, and my phone was obviously using Wi-Fi. However, I was a bit anxious because my Wi-Fi isn‚Äôt always stable, and I wasn‚Äôt confident it would hold up for the entire 4-hour exam.

The first section of the test went fairly smoothly. I found the questions in this section the most challenging, with subtle differences in the answers, but I finished it with about 3 hours remaining.

After taking my first break to grab some coffee, things seemed to be going well. I started the second section, found the questions easier, and finished in under an hour. But then the trouble began.

During my second break, I noticed the monitoring feed on my phone had disconnected, even though the app was still running on my phone and my computer was still connected to the test page. I contacted the proctor, who instructed me to restart the app on my phone. After resolving the issue and confirming everything with the proctor, I was cleared to continue. However, this used up all my break time, and I felt shook up.

As I moved into the third section, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the earlier issue, which made it hard to focus. Then, about 40 questions in, I got a notification on my computer that the Wi-Fi signal had dropped. My heart sank. Despite thinking I was connected via Ethernet, my computer had prioritized Wi-Fi, and the connection failure disconnected me.

Panicking, I refreshed the page repeatedly, hoping it would resolve itself, but nothing worked. I didn‚Äôt want to leave my seat in case I was still being monitored. Eventually, I gave up and turned around to my phone, which was set up for the second camera angle, and noticed two missed calls from the proctor. I immediately called back.

The proctor only spoke Japanese, but I know enough to discuss the situation. They asked me to re-log into both the testing page and the second-monitor app. After I reconnected, they allowed me to continue. At this point, my heart was racing, and it was hard to focus. However, I managed to finish the last few questions with 40 minutes left on the clock.

As I said, I didn‚Äôt review any of my answers as I will sometimes second guess myself. I also felt it was better not to make changes or even check them to ensure there was no doubt about the integrity of my answers during the unmonitored periods.

When I hit the final submit button, I was surprised to see a ‚Äútest results‚Äù button, as I thought this feature had been removed recently. It might be different for ATA‚Äôs system. I was relieved to see a preliminary pass, but I‚Äôm still cautious about celebrating until I receive official confirmation, given the technical challenges I faced.

On the bright side, I feel more confident in my ability now. If the worst happens and I need to retake it, I‚Äôll reschedule immediately and triple-check that my computer is truly connected via Ethernet!

Thanks to everyone on this sub and I will update when I get an official confirmation on my test results.

I had stopped Metpolol low dose 12.5 mg's around 6mg, EP confirmed it doesnt prevent AFIB but it can stop it from going so fast. My reason was sort of depressed, in the dumps, and vivid dreams. My sleep doctor (Pulmonolgist Sleep Medicine Chief of clinic near me)  said to try Atenelol. he said Atenelol does go to brain to affect dreams like metopolol.  So yesterday EP said he thinks ""its the same thing""

1hyozsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hyozsv/gaggia_espresso_evolutionstyledeluxe_breville/," Gaggia Espresso Evolution/Style/Deluxe, Breville Bambino, or something else entirely? AUD [$500] ","# Background

Until this week, I was the reasonably satisfied owner of a Breville (Sage) Bambino machine. I bought it new a couple of months ago, and used it once or twice daily until the pump gave out suddenly. I ended up getting a refund, and now need to replace the machine. When initially researching which machine to buy, I saw the Gaggia Classic Evo come up a lot, and had it not been so expensive, it would have been my immediate pick. Alas, it retails for around $900 AUD, and thus was out of my price range. While I am admittedly tempted to splurge on the Classic, it's hard to justify spending so much on a machine like that, especially at my skill level. As such, I'm wondering if the Espresso Evolution might be a better pick for me? Thank you all for helping out here, I'm keen for a new machine, regardless of what I end up with. I'm open to any suggestions.

# Useful Information

*  Location and budget.
   * I'm located in Australia. It should be noted that we tend to pay a bit more for electronics than people overseas, and our selection is typically a bit more limited. At this stage I'm looking to spend around $400-500 AUD, which is a max of $300 USD.

* Drink Type
   * I mostly drink milk based coffees, primarily Flat Whites. With this in mind, one concern re the Gaggia Espresso Evolution its incredibly low clearance height. It looks like I'd need to take the drip tray out to pour shots, and I'd have no hope of being able to use my scales. I typically drink 1-2 cups a day, and often make coffees for others, typically at the same time as I make my own. I always use freshly roasted and ground beans.
* Space limitations
   * My old Bambino was purchased *because* of its tiny size, but I use the machine enough that I don't mind it taking up a decent amount of space.
* Grinder
   * I've been using shitty little combined coffee and spice grinder to grind my beans, but I'm about to buy a Baratza Encore Espresso grinder. I'm so keen to use it.
* Experience Level
   * Although I have actually worked as a Barista before (about 8 years ago now), I definitely consider myself a beginner enthusiast. I love making coffee, and I love getting precise with it. This, to be honest, was one of the problems I had with the Bambino. Making coffee with it always felt a little soulless, and I was never able to properly dial my shots in to a point I was happy with. This, however, was likely due to the lack of a proper grinder, and my skills as a beginner. It doesn't help that the machine looks incredibly dull too‚Ä¶ With all this said, I also need a machine that I can use to make a quick coffee in the morning.

It's been about a few years since I've seen him so we went out for coffee to have a chat. I knew him back in my Christian days, and I was really hoping the conversation wouldn't turn religious. Welp... it did.

He asked me which church I go to now, and I just told him honestly that I don't attend anymore. He was baffled and asked if I maybe attended services online. Nope. He then asked, ""Don't you still have a relationship with Jesus Christ?""

""Not anymore.""

Cue the shocked face, the awkward minutes long pause of disbelief, and the bargaining questions. How could you lose belief in something so true? Don't you care about where you go when you die? What about your family? I tried to be as respectful as possible and just said, ""I don't believe in it anymore."" He wouldn't accept that.

""You must know there is a hell, right?""

""I don't think anyone *can* know, and since it can't been known, let alone proven, I withhold belief until I'm presented with enough evidence to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.""

""But everyone knows there's a hell, whether they realize it or not.""

I wasn't really perturbed until this statement.

""No, I don't believe in hell.""

""Yes you do. Everyone believes in hell.""

""Wow. That's pretty rude of you to assert what it is that I believe especially when I'm telling you I don't.""

""I'll prove you believe. What do you think will happen when you die?""

""I don't know. The evidence I have leads me to believe nothing. It'll be like turning off a life.""

""What is nothing?""

""I don't think anyone can define nothing because the moment we observe nothing it then becomes a something. What does this have to do with you proving I believe in hell?""

""Becuase the law of non conservation dictates that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Our consciousness is energy, therefore when we die, where does our consciousness go if it can't be destroyed? Therefore there must be an afterlife.""

I was just left staring at him for a moment before I responded with, ""I'm sorry, but I don't accept your post hoc rationalization as evidence for an afterlife.""

We went back and forth basically with him telling me I'm stupid for not believing in an afterife and pretty much telling me I'm for sure going there if I don't come back to Jesus. I finally stopped it and told him that it'd probably be best if we never met up again seeing as how he is incapable of respecting differing beliefs. He told me, ""I'll pray for you."" I was already done at that point, and that was the last straw. I view prayer as an impersonal act that Christians do to make themselves feel good about themselves because they think they're actually doing something when they're just shouting at windmills like Don fucking Quixote. I turned around walked right up to him and said, ""You can take your prayer and shove it. Your meaningless words shouted at the ceiling fall on non-existent ears,"" and then I walked off. He tried saying something to be but I just didn't care. I'm so sick and tired of losing friends because they can't accept me as an atheist.

I (26M) have been on a new journey that really kicked off end of August. At the time, I was 273lbs, kicking off a depression, and wanting so bad to be a person I could think of as amazing. Over ~18 weeks, I went California sober - only drinking water, black coffee, and the rare Diet Coke. Im a regular at the gym with a set schedule - 3 days of strength training, 2 days of cardio, and aiming for an average Kcal deficit of minimum 1000/daily. For 3 weeks my CW has hovered 241-245lbs. It felt good getting out of the 260‚Äôs. It felt AMAZING getting out of the 250‚Äôs. But for the life of me, going under 240lbs keeps eluding me. 

I know progress isn‚Äôt linear, and I know that staying consistent will yield results eventually. Knowing this doesn‚Äôt prevent the agony and frustration of wanting so badly to have your reflection match the ideals you desire - especially when you‚Äôre putting in the effort to achieve them.

1hyoxgt,https://v.redd.it/2c1jxlewuace1,Lace Tint 101: Find your perfect match üß©,"Hey WSHQ Fam,

Let‚Äôs dive into one of the most important steps in achieving that flawless wig look: lace tinting! Whether you‚Äôre rocking HD lace, transparent lace, or regular Swiss lace, getting the right tint is key to making your wig look natural and undetectable. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the types of lace tint and how to choose the best option for your needs.


1. Lace Tint Spray
	‚Ä¢	What it is: A spray-on product that comes in multiple shades to match a variety of skin tones.
	‚Ä¢	Pros: Easy to apply, buildable coverage, dries quickly.
	‚Ä¢	Cons: May transfer if not sealed; requires a steady hand to avoid uneven application.
	‚Ä¢	Great For: Quick touch-ups and beginner-friendly tinting.


2. Lace Tint Mousse
	‚Ä¢	What it is: A tinted foam that can be applied to the lace for a more customized finish.
	‚Ä¢	Pros: Lightweight, easy to blend, and doubles as a styling mousse.
	‚Ä¢	Cons: Requires a little more time and precision than sprays, can give an orange flashback/undertone.
	‚Ä¢	Great For: Those who want more control over their tint application.


3. Lace Tint Foundation (or Powder)
	‚Ä¢	What it is: Using foundation or pressed powder to color the underside of the lace.
	‚Ä¢	Pros: Accessible (use what you already have!), blendable, and good for beginners.
	‚Ä¢	Cons: Can smudge and transfer; may need frequent reapplication.  Foundation can contain oil which can interfere with your glue or adhesive. 
	‚Ä¢	Great For: Temporary fixes or trying lace tinting without commitment.


4. DIY Lace Tint (Tea or coffee Dye)
	‚Ä¢	What it is: Using tea, coffee, or fabric dye to color the lace.
	‚Ä¢	Pros: Budget-friendly, customizable to your exact tone.
	‚Ä¢	Cons: Messy, time-consuming, and permanent (no going back if it‚Äôs too dark!).
	‚Ä¢	Great For: Experienced wig wearers looking for a long-lasting tint.


Pro Tips for a Seamless Tint
	‚Ä¢	Always test a small area of your lace before applying tint to the entire wig.
	‚Ä¢	Seal your tint with a setting spray or hairspray to reduce transfer.
	‚Ä¢	Consider your skin‚Äôs undertone (warm, cool, neutral) when selecting a tint.
	‚Ä¢	Use natural light to ensure your lace blends seamlessly with your skin.

Dating sucks.. I think we can all agree to that. But a few weeks ago, I recently met someone on a dating app and we really clicked! I asked her out for coffee about a week after chatting via text and she happily agreed. 

The date was good! It was awkward at times, but conversation seemed to go well. However, she was VERY hard to read. I had no clue at all if she was even into me. There was zero flirting, no compliments, nothing that would really indicate that we were on a date and that she was into it. I on the other hand, complimented her smile, her eyes, and her outfit, and said she ""looked really nice today"". 

However, the date continued to go well and she said she was still down to hang out longer. So I suggested going to see a movie, and she was down. Fast forward to after the movie, she walked me to my truck. I jokingly with a smile said, ""you're really hard to read."" And she nodded and said ""Oh yeah? I'll keep it that way then."" And then she KISSED me. Full on make out session by my truck. So then...on the drive home I was like, okay you're way overthinking it. She's clearly into you.

So the next day comes around...I reach out to her and say good morning, thank you for yesterday, etc. I didn't hear from her for a few hours, which is fine. She said she was busy with a friend. So I said, no problem, text me later whenever you aren't busy! The rest of the day went by and I didn't hear from her...So I texted her and let her know I was about to head to bed, hoped she had a good day. She quickly texted me back a good night and to sleep good. -\_\_- Okay cool. I honestly got the feeling she just wasn't into it or having second thoughts...

So then Monday..I didn't really hear from her much again, but I still tried initiating conversation. She responded sparingly, but responded nonetheless. Very short..nothing reciprocating..I was asking all the questions. So I was still feeling like she just wasn't into it...but then I then get home from work and there's flowers at my door..From her..thanking me for a great date. Que head explosion....So now I'm like, okay wow you really ARE overthinking this. She likes you! I thanked her of course..and then asked her out to dinner the next night. Which she said she was down for! 

Last fast forward...Tuesday comes around, I text her around lunch time and ask if she was still down for dinner. She said yes, but that she got off work at 3:30. I said, okay cool! We can meet up down town, get some coffee and kill time before dinner since 3:30 is a little early for dinner. How does that sound?  
She texted back and said, yeah you're right that is early for dinner. We can do another night :)  
I then responded and said, no it's totally fine, I don't mind! Like I said, we can just kill some time until we get hungry for dinner.   
Again, she was resistant and said, it's really okay, I know that's early.   
So I felt a little pushed in a corner at this point and just reiterated again, that I did NOT mind the time, but finally told her, if another night works easier for you, we can do that too...

Her immediate text after saying that was ""Okay next time then :)""

I was so damn confused. I just told her, okay no problem, let me know if you end up changing your mind. She didn't follow up with anything else...no rain check attempt..nothing. 

So I kinda let her be...the day passes..we're into the evening at this point. If you want specifics, it had been 8 hours since that exchange and since I heard from her. So, naturally...I get the hint. She's hot and cold, and I don't have time for that truthfully. She clearly wasn't THAT into me. So I kindly told her, hey I'm not really getting the impression you're into this as much as I am. No hard feelings at all, I just feel like communication has lacked a bit and I was really confused about today.   
To keep from rambling, she basically got defensive back with me and said that she thought I was the one not interested. And said ""I wouldn't have sent you stupid flowers if I wasn't into you, but okay. Good luck.

The animals attacked the family dog, which had to be rescued from the mouth of one of them by the owner's mother. The dog suffered serious injuries and underwent surgery at a veterinary clinic. There is no information about the dog's state of health.

According to the resident's statement, a 28-year-old woman, she was talking to an acquaintance at the gate of her house, arguing about renting a property. They both entered the house to have coffee, at which point the gate was apparently left closed, allowing the wild dogs to enter. Shortly afterwards, they heard the desperate cries of the family dog.

On checking what was going on, the resident reported seeing the two dogs in the yard attacking her. The owner of the animals, who was present, tried to control the dogs, who were only tied up by ropes and without muzzles or harnesses. Despite the man's efforts, the dogs continued to attack until the complainant's mother intervened and managed to remove the dog from the mouth of one of the animals.

After the attack, the dog was immediately taken to a vet and underwent surgery due to the seriousness of her injuries.

The case was registered at the police station as an omission of caution in the keeping of animals, in accordance with article 31 of Decree-Law 3.688/41, which characterizes it as a criminal offence to drive animals in such a way as to endanger the safety of others. The police are investigating whether the owner of the dogs was negligent, considering that the animals were on the public highway without the proper safety equipment.

The Campos do Jord√£o police station will conduct investigations to clarify the circumstances of the incident. The police will assess the conditions in which the dogs were led and the possible legal consequences for the person responsible for the animals.

Some sparing a glance, eyes drawn to the guitar across the man's back the instrument seemingly out of place. Most simply ignored him to curse back at a blaring horn while others paid no mind to either; instead, simply pulling their soon-to-be-traded for winter-coats a bit closer.

The air cooling just enough to convince most that breaking out their thicker wear early was the wiser choice for any November noonday shopping. Those that had spared a glance *and* pulled their light jackets a bit closer did so to ward off more than the chill. Their suspicions of the obviously homeless man with his instrument quite clear, not that the man seemed to mind in the least.

Out of a great many things that had a place here in the square or even in this universe, Izime knew he wasn't one.

That being a good thing, as the types of creatures that shared his powers wouldn't take lightly to fresh competition.

Izime knew the safer option was to sit back and relax.

So that's what he did, taking a more hand's off approach to the species he'd been the soul caretaker of in his last life. Here in this universe, he would stand, maybe not beside them, but to the side. Adjacent to the cares and whims of earth as someone who stopped by to spend some time. The issues here were already firmly in hand, managed by those who'd been written in as the planets caretakers.

Izime could just kick back and be another human who made the most of their time. Working, struggling, and above all helping where he could. Though he usually did that last bit off world. Work and struggles tended to stick to Earth where humans were a lot more comfortable in judging other humans.

At least they kept it to a smaller scale here, though they had a guiding hand a lot earlier than his humans had. Wars broke out a lot less when odd were some Joe Shmoe with a cape would start throwing tanks or slapping jets out of the clouds. All in the name of peace. So, the big wigs casting their judgments had calmed down quite a bit.

Though that same level of casual human judgment forced Izime to work the crowd even now.

The few looks he'd noticed he returned with a smile hoping they'd feel a bit more comfortable at the polite response.

Izime more interested in watching the crowd as a whole. Carefully weaving through while they pressed towards him, observing the odd clash. Taking in every single movement and moment, still absorbing the people and the places around him years later.

The oddly comfortable mixture of buildings creating a perfectly working system that clashed with the otherworldly sensibilities behind his teal eyes. Architecture and styles from various ages and comic artists pooling together to form a working kaleidoscope of a time-period here.

Turn of the century cars popping their exhaust alongside electrics, smartphones and payphones sharing the space alike. All having equal support and infrastructure somehow supported in a working economy. During some period that compared to the Earth he held data on from the late 2020's. It all amounted to a slightly offensive world in comparison to the reality he'd known. All in all, it felt like watching someone do what he did better.

Though it also felt like the system here was cheating to achieve this flowing order somehow. Izime wouldn't judge to hard, he'd have like some cheat codes in his own reality. If he'd had those he'd still be there. So no, Izime couldn't say this wasn't a place where he could say he belonged. He'd still allow himself to be offensively impressed in the perfection as he stayed, however.

Even finding a home of sorts, which Izime was making his way back to. Even as his eyes roamed Izime's direction remained true, ears following the beat that signaled the location of his adoptive kin. The square filled with the gentle rhythm of a makeshift drum as two stood motionless in the flow of the busy shopping area.

Izime watched as the crowd passing around them like a bend in a river, the family who had helped him most in this world. Never halting just curving their flow around the obstruction that had anchored his new life; hews just a small trout returning to the comfort of those still waters. Weaving closer towards the two, Izime walked up to the man sitting on a lifted concrete flower bed.

Wesson was one of the first people Izime had met in Centropolis, or at least the first he'd gotten along with decently. The dark-skinned man was seated with one worn boot stomping a steady rhythm onto a five-gallon bucket at his feet. Thick woolen jacket showing stains and wear from the years as a yellowed bandanna held his dreads back from his brown eyes.

Twirling around him was a small girl, Wesson's daughter Shya. Her twisted braids swinging with the rainbow of beads that decorated the tightly woven rows. A small tambourine in her hands, the small toy tom and cheap metal cymbals enthusiastically playing a counter rhythm. The clothes she wore obviously much newer, the thick pink fluffy jacket still shiny and stainless. Though her jeans had a few holes the faded pink pajama pants poking through underneath provided extra warmth.

""Slow ass day Wesson,"" Izime complained, leaning back and watching as Wesson's daughter twirled away happily.

The young girl not yet fully aware of her father's struggles with busking in the chilling November marketplace. More focused on earning smiles than cash as she performed for the few shoppers that paused long enough to give a second glance. Something Izime certainly wouldn't begrudge the young girl of, he'd already had his share of burdens.

Wesson nodded in appreciation at Izime who was returning, holding two steaming cups of coffee under one arm and what he assumed was hot chocolate in his other hand. Izime had taken extra care to not spill the cups, walking with his guitar over his back after taking a break from vocals.

Wesson cast a worried look over Izime, the coffee stains wouldn't add or detract from the tattered dark brown hoodie Izime was wearing over his nicer but still ratty jacket. Both of the coats adding layers that hid the Caucasian man's thin frame while the jeans and boots he wore looked just as worn as Wesson's own clothes if not worse. Mostly because they had previously belonged to the more experienced homeless man.

""Sayna'thing, less te *pote move chans*. It's a good thing to be walking round the market with your guitar though."" Wesson wishing Izime'd not bring them bad luck in creole.

Nodding and casting a glance at the small gathering of bills sitting in the small case that usually held the toy tambourine as he worried. The toy obviously didn't go to the very expensive looking round case Izime had found but Shya had few precious things, and the case fit her toy perfectly. Izime had offered it to the girl to keep her own instrument safe without a second thought or any explanation.

The strange black polymer was just heavy enough to stay put and seemed to shield the days take regardless of how windy it got. A take that was looking like rough split if Izime took his cut.

Brown eyes holding that slightly worried look, the tense features on Wesson's face slowly easing as he turned towards Izime.

His brother not taking his share of the split the last few months had made things a bit easier. Something Wesson knew Izime had been holding back on for their sake

""Bit of advertising,"" Izime nodded placing one of the coffees down one the planter, not needing to look to know what had Wesson's tone worried. The two he'd gotten the drinks for struggling far more than he was now the single father obviously worried with winter fast approaching.

""Think you can give me the backing vocals for 'I'm the Sinner' after this?""Izime asked Wesson for a bit of help with their busking, hoping to fill the case a bit more.

Wesson gave as low nod as he reached for the hot cup of coffee. Thinking that the slow deep intro Izime was asking for would do well to draw attention in the square; the bluesy song well suited to Izime's voice.

He had to admit even if Izime lacked range, the white boy could still pour in that soul. It was obvious the younger man had put in practice at some point in his life. Combined with Wesson's own deeper tone and the natural acoustic reverb of the shopping square it was a sure way to score some quick cash.

""First acts almost done see, Shya come get a cupp'a hot chocolate."" Taking a slow sip of his coffee Wesson glanced upwards towards the dropping sun before calling his daughter over.

Shya turned and stopped the little rhythm she'd been tapping out. Quickly running back the short distance to her father and looking down at the old dirty planter he was sitting on, to finding nothing. Her bright green eyes instead turned towards Uncle Izime who was already standing there and holding out a cup of the sweet marshmallow topped drink.

""Hey Shya, think you can give me a bump and tap on your dad's next rest?""Izime bent down and asked the young girl while holding out the cup of hot chocolate. Explaining what he meant a bit better as he did so, ""The pause after your dad stomps?""

""*Mwenkapab*! Yes, I can,"" Shya agreed, smiling brightly as she took the paper cup. Blowing for half a second, she took a tiny sip, quickly covering her mouth with the back of her hand.

The drink still a bit too warm as it had burned her lips.

""Is Uncle Izime gonna sing more?"" Scowling as her hot chocolate betrayed her, Shya walked over and sat it in time-out next to her father's cup of coffee as she asked the question. The young girl looking up at her father and uncle Izime who were watching the crowd. Their minds full of the things that worried adults, Shya waiting for a response.

Izime smirked at Wesson over his coffee, taunting him a bit at Shya's apparent excitement before taking a few deep sips. The heat already being pulled away by the November chill. Bringing the steam wafting around Izime's face as he watched the shoppers pass by.

Wesson simply nodding at Shya while he watched the white boy's head grow several sizes. The Haitian listening to the square filling with the noise of idle chatter instead of replying, knowing it only feed that ego.

The small chiming addition of the toy tambourine and drum now absent as the three prepared to bring an end to their little drink break.

Izime waiting until there was a slight lull in white noise, calculating the near perfect moment he reached back and slipped his guitar around. Pulling the strap with a finger Izime felt the comfortable weight of the old electric acoustic in front of him. The worn wood looking just as rough as the stained brown jacket he had over his plaid button up.

Izime felt glad the only people he cared about were his fellow performers, not worrying about how he looked for the crowd.

Adjusting his jacket a bit, before grabbing the cheap split body by its neck and running his fingers over the strings. Izime could feel the wooden body begin to fill with vibrations, giving a nod in appreciation at the sound. Reaching down for one final sip, he turned and sat his coffee back on the concrete planter giving a glance at his two co-performers.

""On three?""Izime asked Wesson and looking at Shya as he waited for a nod.

Izime watched Shya's big eyes looking between her father's worn boot and himself, feet dancing nervously afraid she might miss her first notes. Wesson didn't bother replying, instead simply beginning the easily repeated intro to the song. His lower baritone reaching through the crowd. Izime tapping on his guitar setting himself along with the count Wesson was providing as Shya finally gave him a confident nod.

Pulling the chill November air in Izime was immediately glad he had gotten that cup of hot coffee.

The colder air threatening to take his attempt at sounding raspy and almost snapping the notes as his voice nearly cracked.

Izime shook head and doubled down as the air left his lungs, the square filled with the sound of his voice. The deep thump of a worn boot on a bucket was shortly followed by a small tap and crash of cheap metal. Izime giving an approving nod easing Shya's worries as she'd arrived right on cue.

Shya's smile grew as she watched her uncle sing.

Amazed at how quickly he'd recovered not even batting an eye in front of a square full of people. Her tiny body quickly loosing that little tense nervousness she'd always felt when they performed. Shya knew they needed to do their absolute best when her uncle Izime was in town.

It didn't take much to realize her life was a bit different that the others at school, something that had upset her after a while. At Shya's young age she had easily draw the correlations between a good performance and having a better night. A few good shows meant a new jacket or a treat, a few great shows could add to a week of clean beds.

Those weeks sounding much more like the lives those bullies at school had taunted her with; those coats not getting nearly as many jeers.

Something that'd angered the young girl; convincing her it was worth causing a bit of trouble with those kids in school. Trouble that'd eventually had her father coming in to school and leaving her with a whole lot to explain to both him and the principal.

After a few long talks with her father and Uncle Izime, Shya had agreed that working to better their lives was more productive that hating their situation uselessly. Shya knew it was up to her to and her father to make the most of the rare chances they had, not wanting to waste it. The only time they had a chance to really amp up their performances was when Uncle Izime was here to help her dad out properly.

Uncle Izime's smile was a sure sign that this show would go off well and they'd celebrate tonight once again. Shya still had to admit that it was rather hard work as despite their efforts the small crowd kept moving on regardless of Izime's abilities.

Though now more than a few paused to tap their feet as the three buskers filled the square with a touch of live music.

Some among the toe tappers already moving to toss bills into the small tambourine case.

Other stopping to record with their cellphones.

Wesson giving Izime an encouraging nod, both knowing the inclusion of social media usually encouraged generosity. The phones working their magic as some of those not even stopping to listen simply wandered through the frame to be seen tossing in their own change.

The three trailing into other more exciting genres than the attention-grabbing blues song as it ended. All the while each scanned the crowd, finding those who could be worked with. Shya dance happily with some passing children, Izime carefully lowering his volume and changing to a lullaby as a family with a stroller full of tiny sleepers passed by. Wesson doing a bit of rapping as the acoustic songs were burned out on the crowd.

Each carefully finding the moments where they could give a more personal touch, possibly squeezing out those extra few desperately needed pennies.

The small gathering of bills and coins growing slowly but steadily until the sun had finally dropped far enough that the squares lighting kicked on.

Wesson's foot eventually slowing as it tired, his throat a little sore from providing vocals. The man watching as Izime slid the guitar off his shoulder and sat it down beside him, hand rubbing at fingers tired from reaching for frets. Shya's tambourine tapping coming to an end as she looked up dejectedly. The lamps flickering to life around her the first signs of an approaching bedtime.

The square's lighting system activating was something Wesson and Izime had agreed was the best sign to close up shop for the day. Shya having school during the weekdays and neither of them wanting to try and work the rowdier weekend crowds that passed through the square.

Younger adults more prone to antagonizing them than stopping to enjoy the music.

Then there were the drunks that enjoyed fighting after leaving the high-end bars.

None of it was worth the trouble they might rouse or running the risk of getting kicked from the square, so the three buskers quickly packed up their things from the hard day's work.

""Another day *travay di*, get your cut *fanmi*?"" Wesson whined about the days labor in his native tongue before motioning towards the case in Izime's hands now that they were alone. The three having already left the square through a less traveled back alley, a path more comfortable socially for the three less attractive aspects of society.

""The crowds were easy today; besides I still got some stashed. I do want you and this little queen to get out of the shelters for a bit, so you take this,"" Izime gave Shya an exaggerated flourishing bow before turning to shove the case into Wesson's arms, ""Find a motel, I hear about you two couching it in a trap house I'll break my guitar over your fucking head.""

""You,"" Wesson was about to let it slide until he felt the unexpected heft of the case, yanking Izime back before quickly undoing the clasp to at least peek inside.

There among the loose change and pocket money lay a brick of much newer crisper bills still in their bank bands. Wesson swallowing back more than a few questions as he considered what little he knew of his 'brother'.

Izime had been a worse state than Wesson had originally.

Wesson had found him with little beyond the rags he had managed to turn into clothes. Now just a handful of years later Wesson found himself once again thanking his stars for the turn in karma, but that quick turn only worried him all the more.

""*Malpw√≤pte*"" Wesson cursed under his breath, knowing Izime could easily understand him. Still not handing the money back, Wesson instead clasped the case closed and leaned closer to Izime. The worried father trying to whisper through his tense nerves so Shya couldn't hear, ""Ye best not do something stupid Izime; that's a stack, an actual stack.""

""It's clean and so am I,"" Izime just shook his head thinking of things Wesson was better off not knowing. The words were true enough, though it had taken some work to turn that clean money into earth cash. Izime shoving the case closer to Wesson as he made himself clear, ""By the way I wasn't asking.""

Wesson gritted his teeth ignoring Izime's aggressive tone on the last part, taking the case that was now stuffed full of loose bills and an actual strapped band of much larger bills. It was clear enough that Izime wasn't being completely honest, not wanting to reveal the truth of where the money had come from. Wesson could also tell that it was more complicated than some petty crime and while it might not have been spotless the cash wasn't dirty.

Izime was his brother, and he trusted him to not put Shya in danger; if his brother said the money was clean then it was. Where it came from didn't matter nearly as much as making sure Shya and himself were taken care of. His daughter deserved a clean bed and a better life than he could currently provide, and Wesson wasn't so prideful that he'd refuse the help.

As much as he appreciated it though, one had to wonder if Izime was doing something questionable or maybe even shameful to help them out so much. Wesson could tell Izime still had his own world full of secrets they'd never shared; family always knew best after all.

""Iz, you leaving again hmm?"" Wesson gave Izime a bit of an accusing look as he asked the question. The man had stuck around for nearly three whole months this time, but Wesson hadn't forgotten that face; the spaced-out look of elsewhere. Worry forcing the man back into his native creole once more, ""*retounen byento*, come back quick; for Shya *tanpri*?""

""Need to take a trip, same as ever; but I will. So, you two make the most of that,"" Izime explained, tossing a lazy punch at Wesson's shoulder while they both watched Shya play. ""I had a run of luck and realized I don't need it, not like the rest of my family. Its clean and safe; you're family so I want to hear that your clean and safe to.""

""Same *mon frere*, right back at you."" Wesson managed a smile through his worry, grinning the irony of his brother's lighter skin in his own hand. The shorter dreaded man pulling his lighter skinned brother in for a shoulder bump before releasing the man.

Wesson carefully tucked the case under his arm before turning towards a pile of refuse in the alley as he began to remove the camouflage. Tossing a few bags and boxes to reveal a shopping cart that had been disguised as trash. Packed full of various bags and other luggage, bits of clothing and blankets poking through the mesh. Keeping their clothes and stockpile of food safe from the weather and prying eyes.

Wesson busily digging around, finding a place to bury the case before grabbing an extra jacket for Shya. Wesson turned the cart to wheel it down the alley trying to think of a question to ask his daughter, simply something to distract her.

""Motel 5 or Best Sleep-Inn?"" Wesson's words dying out as he watched his once much younger daughter doing her best to act just as big as both Izime and him tried to convince her she was. The girl's father not sure if he actually wanted his daughter to be quite so mature during moments like this.

It wasn't appropriate to throw a fit, but it was certainly understandable, the girl was dearly attached to Izime. Wesson wishing for a moment Shya would ask the question they'd talked her out of years back.

""Now Shya, you be good OK."" Izime turned towards his excitable niece, smiling brightly and confidently even as he knew he was hurting her so. Happy at least to heave take care of the two most important people in his new life. Even if the means were complicated, it wasn't illegal and it let Izime take care of those who needed it.

""Going on another trip?"" Shya stopped tapping at her tambourine letting it fall to her side, eyes dropping as her tiny fist wiped at eyes that most certainly weren't getting wet.

Taking a shaky breath Shya found a can to kick at releasing her frustration not quite comfortable with looking at the uncle she was trying not to blame. Izime was her only uncle and only other family member in this world, and he was leaving her again; she didn't want to part with an angry look and silence.

It still hurt though; her tiny world fell to pieces each time she watched the little family she had shatter. Shya had taken those first years roughly, age and repetition helping her learn that getting upset when Izime left wouldn't solve anything. Now that Shya was bigger, she understood Izime wasn't homeless like she was.

She couldn't afford a home, Izime moved around too much to have one.

It felt hurtful but a part of her young heart still whispered that Uncle Izime didn't care about having a home with them, not like she did with him. Though another part yelled back that it was because her uncle was much more worried that she was being taken care of.

Shya was probably spoiled like her dad said, it was easy to see Izime was doing far too much for them outside of the little work he asked for in return. If Uncle Izime stopped by, they stayed in hotels, and he'd take her swimming. She could eat at McRonald's with just a bit of puppy dog eyes. Something she knew she'd occasionally abused, possibly leading to Izime needing to leave even sooner.

Shya upset with herself as she childishly wanted that feeling of 'being spoiled' even longer. All while wanting to recognize the love she held for her uncle in letting go without a tantrum. Sniffling back the moments where she'd made the most of what little life had gifted her.

The tiny girl finally looking up at the man who'd patiently waited through her sniffles.

The strange funny man who'd she at first begrudgingly shared her suppers with as dad had shown him the local kitchens, now taking up a position as the second supporting pillar in her life. Still just as willing and patient with her, as she'd imagined she was with him back then.

""I'll probably be back around January."" Izime offered, nodding at Shya who hadn't managed another steady word. Bending his knees to give the girl a warm look, holding his arms open for a hug which the sniffling Shya quickly gave.

Izime tentatively giving her and Wesson a rough time frame on his return to Centropolis at the same time, never sure of just how long he planned to spend traveling. Sometimes it was a bit rough looking for places in the super-hero influenced world to ply his particular trade, sometimes staying was even rougher.

""Go'on south, best to stay till spring."" Wesson assumed Izime was chasing the warmer climates to do physical labor, only bothering to ask for one minor thing for his daughter. ""Be a treat for Shya to see you on the holidays but the *kizin gratis* aren't exactly welcoming, still the soup line would be warmer with you beside us, yes?""

Izime paused for a moment as he considered all the places he could go, had already gone in this rather odd universe. Almost instinctually refusing Wesson's offer before he'd really replied at all.

""North, got some business around Voltham City. Christmas is... I'll try and swing by but no promises."" Izime shook his head, stopping as he took a slow breath to offer that soft commitment for the holidays. Considering for the briefest moment how much nicer it would be to go south, let alone to just stay.

South didn't hold much promise aside from involving himself in the magical markets which meant running into Constantinople.

West was Middle City where FazzPazz and Thorn always seemed to be going back and forth at super speeds in a time-traveling rivalry.

Centropolis where he resided now in the middle of the USA was the legendary Thessian psychic's home city and Izime would never cause trouble where Wesson lived.

Then there was Radiation Man who was flying around the globe doing his Zexxian best as the world's defender. James would always return to that little farm in Kansas though.

Izime, well he'd always stay on the move.

""I'm headed this way, you two be safe here in Centropolis OK?"" Izime called out to the two who were walking away.

Wesson beginning to turn the cart down the alley towards one of their little homes, probably the bridge overpass near Gateway. Ears already tuning out any calls the two might have made back Izime turned away before cocking his head back just barely.

Izime bid goodbye to Shya one last time, unsure if she could still hear him. ""Be good for Wesson Shya!""

Izime knew it was probably a bit mean, but he'd already had a life. It had been difficult one but educational in hindsight, and this one had its moments so far as well. So, to make the most of this rerun, Izime just wasn't going to get too deeply involved. He'd had that one life already, all those pains and joys involved with it.

The already lived human had already lost one extended family, so he felt quite comfortable with his decision in keeping this one at an arm's length. That soft detachment would be how he'd trade the driving dagger that came at the end. Only suffering the smallest of paper cuts as those he knew faded away.

Call it being more emotionally efficient but that was his goal this time around.

This was just a second run at the same old simulations, albeit with a few major alterations like the whole Heroes and Villains thing. The trade-off being there was no propagation and no Bell in this universe. Izime knew he was simply a cheap imitation, an insult what Bell had wanted Izime to be.

So, this seemed like a decent plan for living this time around, actually living to some degree alongside these humans.

A better plan than the one he'd he had before that had ended in nothing but loss and him getting everyone killed.

Izime would leave earth to the heroes and take his little moments in the short slices he felt like he could handle. This way the pleas to stay just one more day, the offer to enjoy the winter in their company wouldn't ever be too hard to resist. They'd never have to suffer a no, and he'd never have to give one.

Shya could only hold back so long and the little catching up Izime had done with the family that'd saved his life years ago had drained his entire social battery. That bite of peace was all he could stand. It was better to slip away before he became too integral, too involved beyond being the funny 'Uncle' that stopped by once a blue moon.

Izime continued quickly down the alley opposite of his family, his smile dropping as he recalled the barely hospitable winter haven, he would be making do in. Mind focusing on his job here in this world where he could do more for them as that in-between creation. So, what if he was missing out on some thing's life offered, Izime wouldn't let something so minor bother him.Ironically the 'what' of who he was fit in well here, even if he wasn't ever supposed to have existed in this place. Once more he'd put that to use to ease the burdens of those who'd been left forgotten, that was reward enough.

*Sometimes being human was a pain, so he wasn't.*  
Izime smiled at the thought stretching his neck as he walked, mind returning to thinking about where his plans would be taking him. The hot box of activity and possibility of profit, the high crime area between Voltham City and N.Y.C.'s metropolis, prime grounds for turning a profit quickly.

Izime wasn't technically a super-hero himself and certainly not working for Earth.",1,1736571951.0,WriteFantasyStories,0,1.0,False

Diving into The Genius Wave wasn't all smooth sailing. Despite its flashy promises, some parts definitely left us wanting.

* Exclusive to the official website - You can't just hop onto Amazon or stroll into your local tech store and grab The Genius Wave. It's locked behind the gates of its official site, making it a tad inconvenient for those of us who love comparing prices or reading reviews on familiar platforms.
* Stock issues - Ever tried to get tickets for your favorite band, only to find they're sold out? That's the vibe here. The manufacturer keeps reminding us about ""limited stock,"" which feels more like an annoying marketing tactic than a genuine stock issue.
* Awaiting results can test patience - Imagine staring at seeds in a pot and waiting for them to sprout ‚Äî that‚Äôs kind of what waiting for results felt like. They said ""give it time,"" but how much time does one need to possibly see their genius visualization come to life?
* No quick fix ‚Äì Sure, syncing up to theta states sounds exciting until you realize it's not an instant switch for creativity or problem-solving magic; it‚Äôs more about setting the mood than directly boosting brainpower¬†

Then, there's the ominous stock warning. It's like the manufacturer is saying, ""Hurry up, or you'll miss out!""‚Äîcue the dramatic music. It stirs up a bit of FOMO, doesn't it? Suddenly, you're not just buying a cognitive enhancement tool; you're racing against an invisible clock.

So, while The Genius Wave promises to be your brain's best buddy, it's not without its quirks and qualms. Like any relationship, it's a mix of the good, the bad, and the ""hmm, let's think about this.""

Testing The Genius Wave kicked off with an ambitious goal. Aimed to see if this could really be the game-changer for cognitive abilities, a strict routine was set. Here's how it all went down:

1. Mark your calendar! Every day, like clockwork, set aside time - precisely 7 minutes after breakfast. Why after breakfast? Well, who doesn't enjoy a side of brainwaves with their morning coffee?
2. Get comfy - Find that sweet spot in your home where the noise of the outside world fades away. For me, it was the cozy corner by the window, bathed in sunlight and away from the hustle.

7. Reflection time ‚Äì After each session, jot down any changes in mindset or sudden bursts of inspiration on paper (or whatever digital note-taking app you prefer). Noticing patterns over time can be quite enlightening!
8. Rinse and repeat ‚Äì Same time, same place, every day for 90 days straight without skipping a beat... or a wave in this case.
9. Weekly wrap - up sessions included reviewing notes taken throughout the week to identify any significant shifts in anxiety levels, focus, energy levels... or lack thereof.
10. Pairing with physical exercise ‚Äì Three times a week, I combined my listening sessions with light jogging or yoga to test if movement encouraged stronger effects; mind-body connection was the buzzword here.
11. Sharing experiences ‚Äì Once a week discussions with other testers provided insights into their journeys and added motivation to stick with it even when skepticism tried to creep in.
12. Final assessment involved comparing notes from Day 1 to Day 90; looking for improvements in mental well-being, creative thinking ability, learning processes enhancements, and yes‚Ä¶ whether it made financial planning feel less like navigating through a stormy sea.

The journey had its ups and downs but followed these steps faithfully promised an adventure‚Äîa quest towards unlocking potential hidden within waves‚Ä¶ sound waves that is!

# Cons

Let's delve into the less sparkly side of The Genius Wave, shall we? It's not all brain-boosting sunshine and rainbows. Remember, every silver lining has a cloud or two lurking about.

* Limited Availability
* Official Website Exclusivity
* Stock Warnings Stir Concern
* Potential Doubts on Effectiveness
* Accessibility Concerns for Some Users
* 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee Leaves Some Skeptical

Here's the thing‚Äîgetting your hands on The Genius Wave feels a bit like snagging a ticket to a sold-out concert. It's only available on the official website, which means, if you're the type to browse through different platforms before making a purchase, you're out of luck.

Then, there's the ominous stock warning. It's like the manufacturer is saying, ""Hurry up, or you'll miss out!""‚Äîcue the dramatic music. It stirs up a bit of FOMO, doesn't it? Suddenly, you're not just buying a cognitive enhancement tool; you're racing against an invisible clock.

Accessibility, or shall we say the lack thereof, also raises eyebrows. It's like being part of an exclusive club, but not everyone's invited. If you're not tech-savvy or prefer the good old-fashioned in-store shopping experience, you might feel a bit left out in the cold.

And let's not forget the 90-day money-back guarantee. While it sounds reassuring, it's also the source of some skepticism. It raises the question: If it's so effective, why would I need 90 days to change my mind? It's like going on a date and thinking, ""Well, if it doesn't work out, there's always the return policy.""

So, while The Genius Wave promises to be your brain's best buddy, it's not without its quirks and qualms. Like any relationship, it's a mix of the good, the bad, and the ""hmm, let's think about this.""

**What we didn‚Äôt like**

Diving into The Genius Wave wasn't all smooth sailing. Despite its flashy promises, some parts definitely left us wanting.

* Exclusive to the official website - You can't just hop onto Amazon or stroll into your local tech store and grab The Genius Wave. It's locked behind the gates of its official site, making it a tad inconvenient for those of us who love comparing prices or reading reviews on familiar platforms.
* Stock issues - Ever tried to get tickets for your favorite band, only to find they're sold out? That's the vibe here. The manufacturer keeps reminding us about ""limited stock,"" which feels more like an annoying marketing tactic than a genuine stock issue.
* Awaiting results can test patience - Imagine staring at seeds in a pot and waiting for them to sprout ‚Äî that‚Äôs kind of what waiting for results felt like. They said ""give it time,"" but how much time does one need to possibly see their genius visualization come to life?
* No quick fix ‚Äì Sure, syncing up to theta states sounds exciting until you realize it's not an instant switch for creativity or problem-solving magic; it‚Äôs more about setting the mood than directly boosting brainpower¬†

8. Rinse and repeat ‚Äì Same time, same place, every day for 90 days straight without skipping a beat... or a wave in this case.
9. Weekly wrap - up sessions included reviewing notes taken throughout the week to identify any significant shifts in anxiety levels, focus, energy levels... or lack thereof.
10. Pairing with physical exercise ‚Äì Three times a week, I combined my listening sessions with light jogging or yoga to test if movement encouraged stronger effects; mind-body connection was the buzzword here.
11. Sharing experiences ‚Äì Once a week discussions with other testers provided insights into their journeys and added motivation to stick with it even when skepticism tried to creep in.
12. Final assessment involved comparing notes from Day 1 to Day 90; looking for improvements in mental well-being, creative thinking ability, learning processes enhancements, and yes‚Ä¶ whether it made financial planning feel less like navigating through a stormy sea.

The journey had its ups and downs but followed these steps faithfully promised an adventure‚Äîa quest towards unlocking potential hidden within waves‚Ä¶ sound waves that is!

# Cons

Let's delve into the less sparkly side of The Genius Wave, shall we? It's not all brain-boosting sunshine and rainbows. Remember, every silver lining has a cloud or two lurking about.

* Limited Availability
* Official Website Exclusivity
* Stock Warnings Stir Concern
* Potential Doubts on Effectiveness
* Accessibility Concerns for Some Users
* 90-Day Money-Back Guarantee Leaves Some Skeptical

Here's the thing‚Äîgetting your hands on The Genius Wave feels a bit like snagging a ticket to a sold-out concert. It's only available on the official website, which means, if you're the type to browse through different platforms before making a purchase, you're out of luck.

Then, there's the ominous stock warning. It's like the manufacturer is saying, ""Hurry up, or you'll miss out!""‚Äîcue the dramatic music. It stirs up a bit of FOMO, doesn't it? Suddenly, you're not just buying a cognitive enhancement tool; you're racing against an invisible clock.

And let's not forget the 90-day money-back guarantee. While it sounds reassuring, it's also the source of some skepticism. It raises the question: If it's so effective, why would I need 90 days to change my mind? It's like going on a date and thinking, ""Well, if it doesn't work out, there's always the return policy.""

So, while The Genius Wave promises to be your brain's best buddy, it's not without its quirks and qualms. Like any relationship, it's a mix of the good, the bad, and the ""hmm, let's think about this.""

I really love that they collab with local artists and create unique dishes to accent and marry the art and cuisine together. Dishes were beautifully presented and the attention to detail was duly noted. I also appreciate that the space has a minimalistic look.

I purposefully didn't look at the menu, pics, or reviews because I wanted to be surprised. My least favorite was the sweetbread. The taste and texture was a bit off putting for me. Some of my faves were the amuse bouche tartare, honeynut squash soup, caviar corn, chicken liver, sour tamarind candy, and raspberry jelly.

We ordered both supplements - the caviar with a savory ice cream and brioche truffle. The truffle dish was delicious and I enjoyed it way more than the caviar. To me, the caviar was overly fishy in taste. On the other hand, the truffles were generously served on the dish and complemented all the different components by letting each ingredient's flavor shine through.

The staff and service was beyond excellent. They took the time to explain the meaning behind every art piece and helped us understand the chef's interpretation of the dish. They answered our questions and engaged in conversation. One of the servers even gave us suggestions to some good Venezuelan places to check out.

All in all, there was good banter and laughter. I recommend this collab!",10,1736571321.0,chicagofood,0,0.92,False

1hyoe7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hyoe7i/my_wife_died_from_cancer_last_year_i_grieved/,"My wife died From cancer last year. I grieved, drinking alone inside our remote farmhouse for months, until I found an antique arsenic bottle in the the stream that cut through our woods... and a strange woman shortly after paid me a night visit.","As I sit here now beside my pond and watch the autumn fog dance along the water, and as the leaves whisper and chatter to one another as the wind lets them, I think of my wife, and how sorry I am I can‚Äôt live the rest of my days here like she wanted.

On our little 12-acre farm. Our little quiet heaven, or at least that‚Äôs what it was supposed to be.

But the land holds secrets.

I know now, without a lingering question in my heart, that Hell exists.

I wish that gave me comfort because that means that Diana is waiting for me at our next quiet little heaven, one that doesn‚Äôt mock the search for peace, but it doesn‚Äôt.

Once the sun winks its red eye closed and retires for the evening I‚Äôll be gone from this place. But there are two things I need to do first, and one of them is to write this down before I put it behind me forever.

Although, a part deep inside of me, the part that can‚Äôt be lied to, knows that the curtain will never close on me again no matter where I go.

Knows that I‚Äôm forever and always awake.

Cancer took her last year. She was thirty-seven. There are a million words in me I could say about losing her. The shock, the denial, the hope, the hope lost, and the twinkle in her eyes that was lost with it.

The pain. Those nonsense last words. The last breath‚Ä¶

She‚Äôs gone now. That‚Äôs all that matters.

We‚Äôd bought a twelve-acre homestead in Southern Illinois to escape the city. The house had been built in 1898 as a colonial revival home and was more or less falling apart, but there was a secluded, rural charm about it. It sat on a strip of land several miles off of any main road, with fields used for harvesting corn nestling the house on either side and behind it was a fenced-in pasture that shot back into the woods, which was perfect for our two horses.

When we did the tour we sat on the porch and looked out at what might‚Äôve been the most peaceful view we‚Äôd ever seen, with fields of wheat yawning and bowing in the wind like a sea of gold across from us. I could see in her eyes that she was in love, and so we made our minds up to make an offer right then and there.

During the final walkthrough, the sellers had forgotten they‚Äôd changed the locks (they were going through what was apparently a rough divorce) and our agent had to call the estranged wife in to give us access to the home.

She was amiable enough when she arrived and gave us a handful of apologies for not remembering to provide a new set of keys, but what struck me as odd, even then, was that she had seemed reluctant to step onto the property at all. She parked her car on the gravel road about one hundred feet in front of the house and talked to us from there, and when she wasn‚Äôt sure which key it was on her keychain to hand to us, she looked disquieted. She walked briskly to the house and fumbled with her keys and the deadbolt until she finally found the right one, and opened the door without walking in, pulling her hand away from the doorknob like it was something hot to the touch.

She said something about needing to get some fresh air, told the agent to bring her keys after locking up, and then hurried back to her car.

I thought there may have just been bad memories of the marriage that she didn‚Äôt want to revisit, or that she maybe felt awkward, or that she was intruding. It all makes sense now.

We knew we had our work cut out for us from the beginning, and when we settled in it was one thing after another: leaking toilets, bad insulation, water damage ‚Äî but we were happy. Diana got sick not long after, but I‚Äôm truly grateful for that short period of time when we would work on our old farmhouse, drink coffee, and watch the sunrise from our front porch, taking in all of the life around us.

After she passed, her sister took her horses as agreed, as well as our two dogs temporarily. The dogs weren‚Äôt my original plan but I was taking everything pretty hard and just needed to be alone for a while; just needed some quiet, which I didn‚Äôt get anyway because of the damned wind, with its constant howling and moaning through the windows.

My drinking had overtaken me. There are large gaps in my memory, especially right after. I drank from the bottle like the evening‚Äôs watery haze would drink me in return, hoping it would dissolve me into nothing.

One morning, I‚Äôd woken up to a massive hangover that felt like it couldn‚Äôt be cured by anything other than the sun and a walk, so I threw on some coveralls and went on into the woods behind the property. I‚Äôd known there was a stream or a creek of some kind that ran East through it, but the thorns and brush were so overgrown I couldn‚Äôt see through more than ten or so feet. There was a supposed path of some kind that led to the stream, and I thought if I could just push my way through enough, I‚Äôd eventually run into it.

It only took me about five minutes until an overgrown ‚Äî but ‚Äî manageable clearing revealed itself and led me to the small stream, a steady flow of water running through it. It was only about six or so inches deep but had carved its own winding path deep into the dirt over the years.

I followed, thinking I‚Äôd see the tracks of various animals nearby that came to drink from it, and I did. I continued on and in the water, I started seeing these broken fragments of bottles. They were old; very old; softened and smoothed by water and sediment and time. They were the kind of bottles you‚Äôd see on a movie set in some 19th-century period piece film, with deep brown and emerald glass with all of those gaudy, oblong angles, like some sort of snake oil elixir.

There were just a few scattered fragments at first, but the further I trudged on, the more abundant the shards became until I came to the stream‚Äôs watershed, and just beyond that was an opening in the ground that looked like some sort of den, big enough to walk in if I crouched. There must‚Äôve been a dozen or so broken bottles in front of it. It was like someone had dumped them in a hurry all at once, or had drunk them in unison and then smashed them for some reason.

Jutting out of the sand in the water, was a green bottle that seemed like it had remained intact over the years. It had two circular finger handles on either side of its neck and some kind of impressed label in the glass, but the letters were immersed and I couldn‚Äôt make them out.

I pulled it free and rinsed it in the water, and I was just able to make out the smoothed letters stamped into the glass: Arsenic.

Bottles of poison‚Ä¶ but why? Why here? And how had this been here all these years without being found or picked up by hunters or one of the previous owners? I reached into my pocket to take a picture of the whole scene with my phone but realized I had forgotten it.

The hole bellowed at me as if commanding me to gaze into its swallowing darkness, and although I couldn‚Äôt see anything, I felt I was being watched from within it.

A coldness crawled up my spine. I shoved the bottle into the big front pocket of my coveralls and made my way back, not being able to help but check behind me several times along the way.

When I got back to the house, I poured myself a neat glass of whiskey. It was still early in the afternoon, but hunting for little treasures on the land was something Diana had loved to do, and so the thought of coming across such a strange find made the antique arsenic bottle quite heavy in my pocket. I thought I‚Äôd lighten it with bourbon.

I placed the old, green bottle on my coffee table and sat across from it on my couch, and I sipped my drink. I stared at it in my quiet, empty house, quiet save for the wind. I sipped again. It was so interesting. I thought deeply on how it got there; how it hadn‚Äôt been found in, well, I don‚Äôt know ‚Äî one hundred thirty years, maybe more? I knew arsenic had been used in tonics and pesticides before they knew how deadly it was, but it just seemed such a strange place for them to be.

I thought maybe the isolation and grief had made me paranoid. I sipped my drink again. I poured another glass, and then a few more. The room went orange as the low sun came through the glass and the wind howled through the poorly-sealed windows.

The old poison bottle had entranced me, and in staring at it I‚Äôd lost track of time. Things went soft around the edges and the whiskey numbed my tongue, glass after glass, but I remember at some point I‚Äôd imagined it had comforted me; spoken to me with silent words.

*Drink*¬†it had said.

*Drink it in.*

And I did. It knew my pain and wanted it gone.

I sunk into the bottle and faded with the evening.

I awoke on the couch with a massive hangover, the bottle still staring. An empty one that had housed the whisky the night before now rested beside it.

I fumbled around in the medicine cabinet for some spare aspirin and forced them down with some water from the sink, and went to the front porch to sit in my favorite chair and catch some crisp morning air.

When I stepped outside, I noticed that the chair had been turned around, toward the windows, facing right into my living room where I had slept the night before.

It had been pulled close to the glass, almost like whoever was sitting in it wanted to be as close as possible to get a better view of the inside.

It had to have been me, I‚Äôd thought. But why the hell would I do that?

The wind had been howling and was known to blow things around, sometimes clear into the yard, but this chair was made out of cured oak and weighed thirty, maybe forty pounds. It didn‚Äôt seem likely to have moved it.

This heavy, floral smell clung to the wood, like some sort of gaudy lavender perfume you‚Äôd find buried in some box in your grandmother‚Äôs basement.

Not thinking of the absurdity of it, I went back inside and sniffed the mouth of the old bottle. Nothing but the remnant smell of water.

The pain from the hangover pulled the turned chair to the back of my mind. I had been in a drunken stupor and could‚Äôve fumbled around out there, doing God knows what. I only managed to make it a few hours before heading to the liquor store to grab another bottle.

I sat back on my couch, across from the old green bottle and its drained companion from the night before, and I drank in silence, just like it wanted me to.

Sometime during the night, maybe eleven or so but It‚Äôs hard to say, I was very drunk, I was browsing my phone from my couch, and three soft knocks tapped at my door.

I didn‚Äôt see any car lights come down the gravel road that ran adjacent to my house. Maybe one of the neighbors needed something, I‚Äôd thought.

For reasons I can‚Äôt quite comprehend, I offered a consulting glance at the bottle on the table. It told me to answer in its wordless way, and I listened.

I got up and went for the door, flipping the light switch to the porch on and remembering there had been a short in the wires. I opened it.

There stood a thin young woman, faintly bathed in what little light the only lamp in the living room offered. It was hard to make out her features, but she looked like she might have been in her early to mid twenties. Her hair was long and looked like it could‚Äôve been a light brown, draping halfway down her back. She wore this white embroidered nightgown that might have been beautiful, except even in the timid light I could see dirt on it in several places.

The shadows hid much of her face, but even then she looked pallid, her eyes bringing about this astounded look on her face as if she were confused or lost.

I stood there with my drink in my hand, unsure of what to say or how to address such a strange and unexpected visitation in the middle of the night.

She said that she was sorry for disturbing me, but that she was looking for her dog. She said she lived about a mile down the road and had been hearing prairie wolves the past few nights, and her dog had run off into the woods and was nowhere to be found. She said she was getting very worried they might have tricked him into chasing after them.

I told her I hadn‚Äôt seen or heard of any coyotes and then asked her about the dog. She said he was a collie and his name was Copper. I looked down and noticed she didn‚Äôt have any shoes on and her feet were covered in mud.

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ you go running through the woods in a gown without shoes on to look for him?‚Äù I asked her.

She glanced down and studied her muddied feet with that same surprised look and said nothing.

I thought maybe she was drunk or medicated, but she looked harmless and the whiskey had always made me well-disposed. I told her to wait a moment and I‚Äôd go get a towel so she could wipe her feet off and could come inside and warm up for a moment. Then, we‚Äôd take a spotlight to go looking for him.

As I reached to close the door handle and grab a towel, I noticed her eyes, so dazed and cloudy and confused before, now sprung alive in the dark with a distilled intensity, focusing in on the green arsenic bottle that sat on my coffee table.

She took a single, eager step toward it, stopping just before my doorway. I held my hand out to halt her, a little startled by the approach but still attempting to be polite.

She gave a sheepish grin and shook her head, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm deeply sorry. The cold has made me too eager for warmth this evening,‚Äù she said.

It was so fast I could‚Äôve easily missed it, but as she smiled I noticed the inside of her upper lip stuck to her teeth, lagging on one side before breaking free as if her mouth had been exceptionally dry. The flesh of her lips looked ‚Äî harder than usual; stiffer, thin slivers of her dark gums revealing themselves. The whiskey had dulled my senses, but when she stepped in closer, I also noticed a lavender perfume smell on her and thought of the chair outside.

She could‚Äôve just been dehydrated for all I knew, but the whole thing just felt off; felt wrong. I closed the door and caught her glance at the bottle with that same look again, unable to will her eyes from peering at it.

I stood there for a moment, hand still on the doorknob, and then flicked the deadbolt locked with careful fingers.

I thought about calling the police at that instant.

It was weird, sure, but I‚Äôd ran out after our dogs half-dressed, with no shoes on before when they chased deer or a passing car or something, so it wasn‚Äôt unthinkable.

But that smell. There was no mistaking it.

Behind me, I could feel the bottle was displeased.

*Let her in.*

I shook my head at it and then downed the rest of my drink. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúPardon?‚Äù I could hear her say from the other side of the door.

‚ÄúActually, I‚Äôm very sorry, but it‚Äôs late. I can call someone for you if you like. I‚Äôll keep an eye out for Copper and will take him to your house if he turns up. Which house did you say it was down the road again?‚Äù

There was a pause that felt like an eternity. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she said, finally, not answering my question.

She sounded disappointed. Not angry or insulted, just let down. I opened my mouth to apologize again, but the words never managed to crawl out of it.

The lamp‚Äôs dim light didn‚Äôt reach far enough to illuminate the porch through the windows, but in the darkness, I thought I could see the silhouette of a head tilt its way into view from the side of the windows the front door had been butted up against. The soft creaks of graceful bare feet on wooden steps groaned as she left the porch and she walked into the night without saying another word.

I grabbed my nine-millimeter and made my way around the other doors to double-check the locks. My mind was reeling; trying to process what had just happened. ‚ÄúPrarie wolves‚Ä¶‚Äù I said to myself as I poured more bourbon into my glass. Who calls them that these days?‚Äù

A part of me felt guilty. Maybe I‚Äôd just sent a poor girl with a missing dog back into the cold, but her mouth; that perfumed smell on her that saturated my chair the night before; how she looked at the green bottle on my table.

My heart pounded in my chest. I didn‚Äôt think she could pose any real physical threat to me, but I felt uneasy. Un-alone. I took another drink from the glass.

I pulled my phone out to call the police, trying my best to stay out of the line of sight of the front windows. Although I‚Äôd heard her walk off moments earlier, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel naked through the glass. I got ready to dial the local station‚Äôs number, but the old green bottle beckoned me over to it.

*Drink*¬†it had said. And I did. I thumbed my phone back into my pocket and sunk back into the couch, and drank myself into an empty void.

Three empty bottles greeted me from the table in the morning, the newest member lying on its side.

I was on the floor.

Even with the throbbing headache, I thought of the strange woman, and how I managed to get drunk instead of calling the police. I looked around. The house was trashed. I hadn‚Äôt cleaned it in weeks; hadn‚Äôt even swept up the clumps of dog hair that accumulated in the corners of the rooms and under the furniture from months before.

And now my drinking had gotten so bad, I couldn‚Äôt even manage to call the police before blacking out.

Diana would‚Äôve been heartbroken if she‚Äôd seen this. She hated my drinking. I let shame hit me like a puff of heavy smoke, and then I called the sheriff. As I dialed I could still feel that green arsenic bottle pulling my gaze toward it, weighing the room down from that coffee table and anchoring everything in place, drawing me in like a dancing fire in the dark.

The sheriff came by not long after and I told her what had happened the night before; that a strange young woman was knocking on my door in the middle of the night but hadn‚Äôt actually done anything illegal that I could be sure of, but that she might have been trespassing on my property the previous night and might have been on drugs.

I told the sheriff where the woman said she came from and asked her if she knew any of the homes along the road the woman had described to me. She said there was only one within a few miles on that particular stretch, but the house had been condemned twenty or so years. She said drugs had gotten pretty bad in the neighboring town, and it was possible the problem had made its way to the more rural parts of the area.

She told me she would ask around in the area to see if any of the other homes experienced anything similar and then offered to check in throughout the night.

I told her it wasn‚Äôt necessary and that I had plenty of guns in the house to protect myself with if it came to that.

After the sheriff left, I uncorked my bottle and poured a glass. I just needed to take the edge off. When I looked over at the coffee table I noticed the antique bottle was gone.

Panicked, I searched the house for it for fifteen or so minutes before I realized I‚Äôd put it in my coat pocket before the sheriff came by earlier, just to keep it close.

A few hours later, as the sun was going down, I went around back near the gated strip that led to our pond and pasture that was butted up against the woods, where Diana‚Äôs horses used to be.

There had been some equipment I‚Äôd left out there for weeks and there was supposed to be a storm coming that evening, and so I‚Äôd wanted to move everything into the barn.

When I got back to the gate I noticed it had been opened, which was something I never did, even with the horses gone. In the fading light, I made out‚Ä¶ footprints, along a thin beaten path that ran through the center of the strip where the horses used to walk up to get feed.

Bare footprints, from small bare feet. She had walked through the woods, through the pasture to come knocking on my door.

I thought I could make out at least two sets going both toward the house and then back down the path again, but with overcast blocking the moon and stars it was getting hard to see anything.

I followed the footprints two hundred or so yards until I could see them cut down into the pasture and to the gate that led into the woods.

It had also been left open. I reached for the old green bottle for comfort and realized I‚Äôd left it in the house.

I needed my gun. I needed my gun and I needed to call the sheriff, and I needed that god damned bottle.

I began making my way back to the house when I saw the woman, walking past the pond and the mausoleum where Diana rested, and heading toward the house. She would‚Äôve been impossible to make out in the dark if it weren‚Äôt for that white gown.

I yelled out to her and started running before tripping over some broken wire fencing that was on the ground. She either ignored me or couldn‚Äôt hear my voice through the rustling corn, which had begun to move with the wind from the oncoming storm.

I was just too far away from her. She made her way to the house with this calm grace and then went around it to the front. I realized my gun had been on my table, in plain sight, and I hadn‚Äôt locked my door.

I‚Äôd been drinking until I was numb, just like that fucking bottle had told me to; made myself careless and stupid.

There were hammers and a machete in the barn, but it was in the opposite direction, and by the time I grabbed one of them she could easily have been inside the house for a minute, maybe more. The best thing I could find on the way was a little trench shovel in the garden. I grabbed it.

When I got around to the front of the house, the door had been cracked half-open. She‚Äôd gone inside. The wind blew harder and began its howling, now carrying cold pellets of rain that stung as they hit my face.

My legs didn‚Äôt want to approach the house, but slowly, I did, that middle step to the porch creaking the loudest it ever had, even in the wind and the rain.

I pushed the door open further with the tip of the shovel. The whiskey bottles that had made themselves so comfortable next to the old green poison bottle were scattered about the floor, the green bottle gone. The gun was still sitting there, untouched. I grabbed it. I looked around for my phone but didn‚Äôt see it in sight.

I could hear her walking around upstairs, in what sounded like Diana‚Äôs office. I aimed my gun into the darkness toward the top of the stairs and yelled out to her: ‚ÄúCome out of there! I‚Äôll fucking shoot you if I have to.‚Äù

The creaking floorboards stopped for a moment, and then she walked out onto the landing; an obscure phantom in the dark, except for the faint lunar glow of her gown; except for the whites of her confounded eyes.

She had the bottle in her hands and she seemed to be crying. Her hands were shaking. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt drop it,‚Äù I said lowly; eagerly.

She tilted the bottle up above her head and stuck her tongue in the opening of its neck, desperate for something that hadn‚Äôt been inside of it for well over a century.

Her tongue made this squelching noise as she did it, as if it were much, much too dry. She gave me a distraught look and cried harder.

The wind moaned through the windows; through the darkness of the house. I‚Äôd never felt more alone in my life.

‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt it working, Elijah?‚Äù She asked me from the top of the stairs. I didn‚Äôt know what to say, nor did I have any clue who Elijah was. The woman had clearly lost her mind. I had to make sure she put the bottle down before she broke it.

‚ÄúCome on down. We‚Äôll just talk about it.‚Äù

She cradled the bottle tighter, taking slow steps down the staircase and stopping at its base. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt work for me,‚Äù she said in the dark, sobbing as the words left her.

I lowered my gun and reached for the lamp on the island in the kitchen near the foot of the stairs, and for the first time, I truly saw her.

She wasn‚Äôt much more than an emaciated skeleton. Her skin was hardened and yellowed and pulled tight to her. She looked‚Ä¶ she looked not much different than Diana did on her hospice bed just before the end. No doubt If I would‚Äôve left her in her bed a few days after she‚Äôd passed away, they would‚Äôve been hard to tell apart.

I should‚Äôve been terrified and a part of me was, but she looked so helpless; so pitiful, like a child holding a teddy bear. This overwhelming sensation of sadness filled me.

‚ÄúWhy did it work for you and not me, Elijah?‚Äù She asked me again. I set my gun on the table.

I thought for a moment about whether or not to correct her on who I was, and decided it didn‚Äôt feel like it was the right thing to do.

I asked her what she meant. Her eyes sobered like she realized I wasn‚Äôt whoever this person was for a moment, and then she retreated.

‚ÄúIt calls to me, but why am I still here and you‚Äôre not?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt respond, but I felt her words. I‚Äôd felt them in me every day since Diana had gone.

‚ÄúAnd the others?‚Äù she asked

I began crying with her.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

At this, she regarded me, then winced with a tender pain and looked away. She tried drinking from the bottle again in vain. I reached out and touched her arm gently to stop her. Her skin was cold and hard.

She sobered her gaze once more, and for a moment the faintest smile rose on her face, and then she retreated again for the last time, into whatever life she had known when she was still alive.

I guided her gently to the door, her bottle still cradled close to her, and stood in the doorway as she left. I wanted to hold onto it more than anything, but it didn‚Äôt belong to me.

I asked her, ‚ÄúWas there ever even a Copper at all?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you seen him?‚Äù She asked.

I shook my head. She turned and moved around the house. I walked into the yard and to the side and watched her go on, back through the pasture and into the woods, the rain and the wind blowing her hair and gown like wild rags. She never looked back once.

And then she was gone.

The next few days I did a deep dive into county records, trying to find anyone who ever owned a home in the area named Elijah, but nothing turned up. It was as if she ‚Äî and whoever Elijah were ‚Äî never existed at all.

I don‚Äôt know exactly what happened to her, but I feel like she was warning me in the only way she was capable, to avoid whatever Hell she had found herself in.

Every day I fight the urge to go back into those woods and see if that bottle is back where I found it. I catch myself walking towards the trees that lead to the stream; to that hole, and inevitably to that bottle.

But I don‚Äôt dare go in.

She‚Äôd no doubt come looking to reclaim it, like she‚Äôs likely done many times before. And if she didn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be strong enough to part with it again.

Which is why I‚Äôm writing this. I said that I have two things to do before I leave, and writing this down had to come first so you might understand when the realtor tells you why there‚Äôs an abandoned mausoleum near the pond in the back pasture.

I can‚Äôt let Diana stay here. I‚Äôm taking her with me and reburying her closer to our hometown, near the place we first met.

Someday, I‚Äôll revisit that place in the woods and see if I can do something; anything for the woman, but I‚Äôm not strong enough to face it. Not yet.

Even now, I can feel the pull of that bottle out in the stream, begging me to come back and take it. And even as I write this, I can feel I‚Äôm being watched from the treeline, and I get this feeling that it isn‚Äôt her this time.",25,1736571056.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1hyoe16,https://i.redd.it/dsp897d9pace1.jpeg,How often should I update my motion graphics?,"
Is Your Animation Rocking Bell-Bottoms?
Let‚Äôs face it: trends move faster than your caffeine-deprived brain on a Monday morning. If your motion graphics look like they belong in a 2015 PowerPoint presentation, it‚Äôs time for a makeover. Styles evolve, platforms update, and viewer expectations skyrocket. You wouldn‚Äôt wear a 10-year-old suit to a gala, so why make your brand do the same online?


---

The ‚ÄúOh No, Not This Ad Again‚Äù Syndrome
Ever seen that one commercial so many times you could recite it in your sleep? Now imagine your audience seeing the same animation over and over. Yikes. Keeping your motion graphics fresh ensures your brand doesn‚Äôt turn into ‚Äúthat ad everyone skips.‚Äù Plus, variety keeps people hooked‚Äîlike Netflix, but for your marketing.


---

Quarterly Facelifts: No Needles Required
Here‚Äôs a good rule of thumb: update your motion graphics every quarter. Why? Because seasons change, campaigns shift, and trends sprout faster than weeds. A spring sale deserves blooming animations; a winter promo? Bring on the cozy snowflakes. Keeping things fresh doesn‚Äôt just prevent boredom‚Äîit screams, ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre paying attention!‚Äù


---

Platform Evolution = Design Revolution
Remember when Instagram was all about square posts? Now it‚Äôs reels, carousels, and stories. Social media platforms evolve faster than your favorite series kills off characters. Your motion graphics need to adapt to these changes. What worked last year might not be optimized for the algorithm jungle today.


---

Don‚Äôt Fix What‚Äôs Not Broken‚Ä¶ Or Should You?
‚ÄúBut my current motion graphics are doing fine!‚Äù you say. Sure, but ‚Äúfine‚Äù doesn‚Äôt win you the spotlight. Even the best animations lose their charm eventually. Updating doesn‚Äôt mean reinventing the wheel‚Äîit means polishing the spokes, upgrading the rims, and maybe throwing in some LED lights for fun.


---

The Takeaway: Fresh Is Best
So, how often should you update your motion graphics? Often enough to keep them looking sharp but not so often you‚Äôre driving your designer to drink (coffee... mostly). Quarterly updates, platform tweaks, and trend awareness are your secret sauce. Because no one remembers the brand that stayed the same‚Äîthey remember the one that kept them on their toes.

Ready to ditch the bell-bottoms and give your graphics the glow-up they deserve?

1hyo8ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1hyo8ny/diamond_vouchers_beverage_packages_an_analysis/,Diamond Vouchers & Beverage Packages: An Analysis,"Having recently hit Diamond I had to reevaluate whether or not the Deluxe Beverage Package was worth it for my wife and I on our upcoming cruise.

In the past we've always purchased it, primarily for the peace of mind of not having a bill at the end of our cruises. Generally I've ""gotten my money's worth"", while my wife hasn't. This didn't really stop us, again, for the peace of mind.

Using my upcoming cruise (8 nights; 3 islands + CocoCay; Oasis class ship; DBP price $80 per person, per day; Refreshment Package $28; Soda Package $11; Coffee Card $31) I compared three scenarios. I'm excluding gratuities and rounding to the nearest dollar for simpler math.

Note as well that Diamond drink vouchers CAN be shared, for example ""could I please have a Tanqueray and Tonic on my Deluxe package and a Strawberry Daiquiri on Diamond Drinks"". This is totally allowed (and encouraged, if you have extra vouchers at the end of the night, buy a round for your new cruise friends!).

**Scenario 1**

Just get the DBP as usual. This would cost $1,280. This does not make sense for us as my wife barely has four alcoholic drinks per day when we buy the DBP (generally I make up for it) and thus can use the Diamond vouchers. This scenario can immediately be excluded.

**Scenario 2**

Buy one DBP and one Refreshment package. This would cost $864 (savings of $416) This can be done by calling Royal and asking very nicely for them to make an exemption.

**Scenario 3**

Buy one Soda package (for my wife) and a Coffee Card for both of us. We would also carry on a case of San Pelligrino sparkling water ($13 at Walmart) and two bottles of wine ($80). This would cost $212 (savings of $652 up front).

---

The up front savings of $652 represents just under 47 $14 cocktails. Over 8 days, that's 5.875 cocktails between my wife and I (or just under 3 each) that we would have to consume over and above the 4 Diamond Drinks we'd each be entitled to. This is not substantially difficult to hit given on past cruises I usually grab a San Pelligrino (while missing my SodaStream at home) or a bottle of still water (usually to stock up for port days) whenever I pass a bar.

Assuming 6 San Pelligrinos per day (they're small, only 250mL -- make sure to hydrate people) that's $18 assuming $3 per bottle. This reduces the price to $508 or 4.5 cocktails per day between my wife and I (2.25 each).

---

For my upcoming cruises, we ended up going with Scenario 2 for the reason that we don't want to worry about a large bill at the end of our cruise, nor do we want to be watching the prices of each drink we order.

Given 5 of the 8 days onboard the ship are either sea days, embarkation day or CocoCay, I suspect our bar tab at the end of the cruise would be close to $652 assuming we didn't look at prices and just ordered what we want.

---

**Final Thoughts**

This analysis was focused on a Caribbean cruise with a private island stop. I suspect if we were to take a port-heavy cruise, then the Diamond vouchers would be more than sufficient; but, given the nature of this holiday (escape the Canadian winter, rest and relaxation) not having a bar tab at the end of the trip outweighs the potential added cost of Scenario 2 over Scenario 3.",3,1736570509.0,royalcaribbean,5,1.0,False

1hyo6sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hyo6sg/sp_the_pallet/,[SP] The Pallet,"Occasionally, after busy periods of life finally slow and I find myself alone with completely uninterrupted moments, I find it within and without me. With work, relationships, and desires both gross and banal underneath all my daily doings, there must be a silent pallet where upon it all rests. Some nights the pallet presents itself.

Thoughts seem to cover the pallet. They cheaply imitate or describe the goings on of the senses, all for the consolation of being easier to shape. I have memories of the thoughts. The memories allow me to see predictable patterns or problems or solutions, and so on. Something allows me to forecast those patterns onto the future. It doesn‚Äôt matter the domain. On some nights, the endless twigs of it all brush aside to make better room for the pallet.

But there‚Äôs still stuff covering the pallet. Emotions are fleeting and, as far as I can tell, trigger from certain waves of thoughts or a grumpy body. Emotions can be felt in the body and there‚Äôs a nervous memory storing them in pockets throughout. On some nights, I feel weightless as those centers cool to uncover more of the pallet.

Though senses remain, still covering the pallet. I can smell the detergent in my sheets. I can feel dry air brought on by winter irritating my nose. I can hear bathroom fans circling. I can see amorphous shadows upon the ceiling. I can taste saliva drying in my mouth. At some point the crassness of the inputs force me to regard them as distractions even though I need them to interact with anything at all. They obscure most of the pallet.¬†

Yet on some nights, when the pallet wants to present itself, I bring a hand to my face for a look. Thoughts trigger up around its use, feeling, dimensions, etc. There are ridges and a light coat of sweat. For a moment past the twigs, however, the hand is briefly self-evident; exactly as the senses report it to be. Something flippantly connects a series of mental dots without my consent:

‚ÄúThe hand‚Äôs charted territory. We decided long ago what function it serves and what level of protection it deserves. No more attention is required on the utility it provides; like shaking someone else‚Äôs hand or picking up a coffee mug. Moving on.‚Äù¬†

This would be the hand recognition story told but recall, on some nights, the pallet wants to present itself.¬†

Therefore the hand in my field of view with its distant sensations, processed solely by these senses, side stepping twiggy thoughts and centers of emotion, on this night, after the pallet decided to finally present itself -¬† never had inherent value. It served no obvious function. It had no allegiance to the forces of good and evil. It had always been impossible to predict what it was capable of doing next. Its potential has always been infinite and hugely alien.

The most pressing part of all is that the hand appears to grow to colossal forms beyond mortal comprehension until all that remains is the pallet. This happens occasionally after busy periods of life finally slow and I find myself alone with completely uninterrupted moments, and so on.

1hyo2o7,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1hyo2o7/my_detailed_writeup_experience_vs/,"My Detailed Write-Up - Experience vs r/JapanTravelTips, plus size perspective, and more!","Been wanting to do a write up for awhile now, especially after seeing the usual slew of posts here, from my post-trip eyes. While we found many of the things shared here to be helpful/true, I did feel like many things varied so much, and I thought our particular experience may be helpful for those who match our details!


*Said details - 3 people, 30 - 35 years old, all us are 220 - 250 lbs. Relatively small amount of Japanese language knowledge.*

***

Our trip was the 1st 2 weeks of October '24. We chose to primarily spend time in Tokyo, with our 1st weekend being a wind down/onsen experience in Hakone, blending into a short day + overnight in Nara before travelling to Kyoto almost entirely for the Nintendo museum. We also did a lovely day trip to Kamakura to get our shrine itch in, guided by close friends of ours who are natives. 


***Some general thoughts, as well as feelings about some of the common advice.***


### Prepare for no trashcans

Yes and no? We were primarily in Tokyo, so I can't speak for all, but we only had a couple times where we were stuck with drink bottles or whatnot for a while. Just stowed them away in a bag til we either found a proper receptacle, or made it back to the hotel. 


***This one's just my advice*** - Buy hand towels, hankerchiefs, etc! We found cute ones all around, and just having one to wipe away sweat was invaluable. Also, many bathrooms didn't have towels or even a dryer, so another for that was often needed!


###Wear good shoes and train to 15k, 20k, or more steps a day before your trip.

Honestly, maybe we had a more chill trip than most. But even at my size and shape I never had issues with the amount of walking, and we definitely had some long days. 


***My takeaway/tips*** - Definitely bring 2 pairs of comfy shoes if you can! I did need the hotspot relief of a different fit after a week. 


**Drink all the water/pocari/bottled tea!** I bought a big bottle of the unsweetened jasmine or rooibos tea every other day for when we were at the hotel. Pocari and water while out walking, whatever sounded good in between! Keep up your veg and protein intake, soak them feets at night, and actually let yourself rest! 


###Plan a ""Zero Day""

If it fits into your schedule even a little, take a true break! We spent a day eating either from the Konbini or quick and delicious restaurants within a 5 minute walk of the hotel, rested up, and played co-op games on our steam decks/laptops we decided to bring üòÇ I don't regret, it was like day 9 or 10 of the trip and we were gassing out. 


###Hotels


A lot of folks change hotels SO many times. If you've got the energy and willpower to set up luggage forwarding and be on the move so much, I'm impressed! We only stayed in 3 places in our time in Japan. 

On that topic, we were lucky to have had enough funds to stay at a lovely apartment style hotel, with a great space for the 3 of us. A small kitchenette, a full shower/soaking tub set up, ect. If you can afford and want a comfortable space to decompress in and have room to basically triple your luggage from shopping and still have room, it's a godsend. We stayed in the Ueno area and loved it!


###Various thoughts/notes


Under the bridge across from our hotel was an adorable shopping area for artisan goods. We bought amazing umbrellas that were good for blocking rain and UV. They also were really compact folded up while still being a great sized umbrella for one. **The shop was called Noble Umbrella.**

While we splurged a little here, they're so nice and will last us for years to come. I'm very pale and have already used it to block sun since returning. 


**October is still pretty toasty!** Though after a week it had cooled down. We did have rain for a good half of the trip, but only one day with notable rain/wind. 


##Being in Japan plus sized 


I am the most curvy and the 2nd heaviest of our group. To be specific for those looking to soothe anxieties here, my BWH is 46/43/55, size 20-ish, and I'm 5ft 7in (170 cm). 


Honestly, I was more often than not enjoying myself too much to be self conscious! Which as an anxious AuDHD type, was a concern. I rarely had issues due to my size. I fit where I needed to, with just occasional awkwardness. I just tried to be extra aware of the space I took up. 


***On masking*** We chose not to mask for our trip, but we made it before flu season and had our vaccines a few weeks before the trip. None of us got sick during the 2 weeks, though 2 of us fell victim a few days after returning home. Honestly, I blame the flight. I'd take more precautions there than we did! I know we got lucky, but it was a risk we decided to take. 


###Staying healthy!

Either take vitamins, or for goodness sake eat more than junk food! We had so much food, good and not so good for you (my partner got addicted to everything Crunky LOL), but I think balancing solid meals and lots of good hydration/rest played a huge part in keeping us healthy for the trip. Oh, and of course plentiful hand washing!! It was the first thing we did getting back ""home"" in the evening. 


##On the train system

We didn't get any more rural than where we stayed in Hakone, but it was shockingly easy to get the hang of! This was one of the things I was really nervous about. We got the Welcome Suica cards at the airport, and taxi'd to our hotel, but quickly got moving after. Google maps was our friend. Suica cards just get quick tapped at the entry/exit gates, and auto deducts on the exit. Lots of them quickly show your balance at the gate arm, too.


**Download offline maps of all your general locations!** And of course make sure you have data to use. We have Google Fi and just adjusted our plan to cover the trip with unlimited, but there are definitely cheaper options out there that I'm sure would work just as well.


###The Google Translate app was amazing...

...and very accurate 99% of the time! Actually had one of our Japanese friends take a look at a long translate of a shrine sign and he was impressed! A great voucher to me *laughs* 

Also had a good experience with the conversation function, for the couple of times we encountered a true language barrier. 

##Learning/speaking Japanese


If you don't know a lick of Japanese, it's definitely helpful to learn some widely used words/phrases. I'm a bit of a nerd and am in the early phases of learning. My biggest win was my above friend complimenting my pronunciation, in his fluent English üòÇ

***Sumimasen*** - ""excuse me/I'm sorry"". SO widely used

***Kore*** - ""this"". Convenient for pointing at items/menus

***Arigat≈ç gozaimasu*** - ""Thank you"". Be polite!


Honestly, that's a microscopic drop in the bucket, but just use what you know! Brush up on pronunciation/enunciation as needed, and do your best. After a week we were much more comfortable breaking out what we did know. It was a super sweet memory when we bought the most adorable pieces from a chocolatier and exclaimed ""Subarashii!"", much to her delight. The feeling of having even short exchanges successfully was fantastic. 


#Lastly, go to Coffee-Kan in Ueno for hotcakes and everything else. Oh my lord, they will be missed! 


So ends my ranting. Feel free to ask questions/discuss your experience~

I can‚Äôt escape it. All of you fucks do not know how to speak English without starting every thought with ‚ÄúI mean‚Äù.

I found an article titled [Why Everyone Is Saying ""I Mean"" More Than Ever](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/language-in-the-wild/202408/why-i-mean-became-the-new-thing?amp) (validating my theory), and it says:

> The discourse marker ""I mean"" functions somewhat similarly in that **it tends to be used to correct or further explain a previous statement** (e.g., ""I mean, it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like eggplant, just not my favorite""). In this way, using ""I mean"" can function as a repair or a linguistic politeness strategy aimed at keeping the relationship among conversationalists harmonious. This is the more traditional and accepted use of the phrase.

> The recent uptick in use that gets some people‚Äôs goat seems to be related to the use of ‚ÄúI mean‚Äù not to clarify, but instead to signal that a speaker is intensifying/justifying something, marking a point as obvious, or making clear a stance or attitude. This type of ‚ÄúI mean‚Äù occurs, for instance, when, following your expressing dismay, a friend justifies driving the extra 15 miles out of the way to a specific coffee shop because, ‚ÄúI mean, they simply have the best coffee.‚Äù

TLDR: ‚ÄúI mean‚Äù used to be a way to correct or clarify a previous statement, i.e. ‚ÄúWhat I mean to say is, ‚Ä¶‚Äù Now, it‚Äôs used fucking constantly in other contexts.

It fucking sucks. I hate it. And I want to worsen somebody else‚Äôs quality of life by forcing them to notice this. 

And for that guy out there who‚Äôs going to use some comment search tool to find when I used ‚ÄúI mean‚Äù in my comments, I‚Äôll acknowledge that I‚Äôve definitely done it as well. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm trying to work on. Please join me. ",6,1736569866.0,unpopularopinion,43,0.58,False

I am on maternity leave with our 2nd baby, so our toddler is not in day care. When I‚Äôm home with both children (2 under 2), I do no screen time, ensure all the meals my toddler eats are healthy/ no sugar, ensure we do at least one social activity daily (play group, library story time, rec center toddler gym etc.) and get daily outdoor play/ exercise. It is exhausting, but it‚Äôs rewarding to me to know I‚Äôm doing the best I can for my toddler‚Äôs development. 

Our son‚Äôs grandparents (both mine and my husband‚Äôs parents) are VERY involved and very loving. They‚Äôre both retired and want to spend as much time with him as possible. They both take the toddler once per week. This was THEIR request and not something I asked for. They love him so so much and really look forward to their days with him.

The problem: On the days that grandparents watch him, they put the TV/ YouTube on for him regularly (not for too long, maybe 10-15 min at a time, but daily). They regularly give him little treats (for example, taking him for a cake pop while they get a coffee during every visit) and generally don‚Äôt prioritize socialization/ outdoor play/ exercise etc. We‚Äôve brought up some things (e.g. limiting sweet treats and snacks) but we feel like we can‚Äôt nag/ nitpick every single thing they do that we don‚Äôt agree with.

It really frustrates me to the point where I want to cut down how often they watch him (maybe every other week). My husband thinks this is unreasonable, as they love having him and look forward to it. He says ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt complain when we get free childcare‚Äù. The problem is, I don‚Äôt NEED the childcare as I‚Äôm more than happy to have my son home with the baby and I. I feel like he‚Äôd be better off at home with me, as I‚Äôd be doing more to ensure I‚Äôm fostering his development.

I feel like I should have the primary say in how my child‚Äôs time is being spent. I m, by no means, want to cut off my child‚Äôs relationship with his loving grandparents. I‚Äôm talking just reducing it to less often than weekly. With that being said, I‚Äôm very type A and regimented, so I realize I‚Äôm probably more bothered by this than a lot of people.

Black coffee steaming in the morning‚Äôs quiet.
A bird soared by, its wings stretched wide,
A symbol of freedom, the turning tide.

He thought of the doll, once frail and lost,
Her beauty purchased, her soul the cost.
Her Botox deflated, her lips now thin,
Her facade crumbled, a life steeped in sin.
He remembered her words, paranoid and wild,
‚ÄúPlease protect me,‚Äù she‚Äôd begged, like a frightened child.
‚ÄúMy ex says he knows people,‚Äù she‚Äôd said in despair,
But her claims were hollow, empty air.

The dark-skinned man, her ""Suge Knight,""
A wannabe king who lost his fight.
He hung himself, his ego gone,
A tragic end to a life all wrong.
And the doll, now convulsing, shaking with dread,
Her mind unraveling, her spirit dead.
Withdrawals tore her body apart,
Her bipolar episodes struck her heart.

Her last image burned as she gasped for air‚Äî
Sex tape screen grabs, a public affair.
The dark-skinned man had posted with pride,
His ""masterpiece"" in their plan‚Äôs final ride.
But as the doll‚Äôs life flickered and died,
Her kingdom of misery crumbled inside.

Wannabe criminals, junkies, fools,
A parade of losers who broke their own rules.
They couldn‚Äôt rob a lemonade stand with grace,
Their legacies ended in utter disgrace.

And the good man? He sat back with a sigh,
For the first time in years, his smile reached his eyes.
The tears came slowly, sadness in part,
But as they fell, laughter burst from his heart.
It wasn‚Äôt sorrow‚Äîit was release,
A cathartic moment of long-awaited peace.

He laughed at the irony, the tragic farce,
Of lives undone by powder and sparse,
Meaningless sex they couldn‚Äôt even feel,
A carousel of shame that spun surreal.

They died by their choices, self-inflicted pain,
Chasing shadows, living in vain.
Junkies, dumpsters, opportunists all,
Each one destined for their fall.

The good man stood, his future clear,
The chaos behind him, no more fear.
His life was his, no strings, no lies,
Under the ticking clock of open skies.

One month passed. The streets grew still,
The project gullies now void of ill.
Tick tock, motherf***ers, your time has gone,
And the good man walks free‚Äîhis life marches on.

The format is straightforward yet powerful, with MP4 videos that are accessible on PCs, Macs, phones, and tablets.

1hynx4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poem/comments/1hynx4n/the_last_reflection/,The Last Reflection ,"The good man sat by his window‚Äôs light,
Black coffee steaming in the morning‚Äôs quiet.
He stared out at a world now free,
From the chaos spun by that toxic three.

His ex rotted in a prison cell,
Trapped in her own personal hell.
The withdrawals she feared, now her only friend,
A slow decay, no escape to mend.
She knew deep down, as her body betrayed,
The good man once kept her demons at bay.
He‚Äôd held her steady, kept her clean,
But she traded peace for a shattered dream.

The dark-skinned man, who once boasted loud,
Met his fate beneath a prison shroud.
Inmates dealt with him in just two days,
His bravado crushed in violent ways.
No gangster crown, no throne to claim,
Just a hollow man consumed by shame.

The blonde-haired fool, the cocky grin,
Who shared in the doll‚Äôs life of sin,
Received four years, a bitter blow,
His arrogance fading as bars did close.

The others? They scattered like leaves in wind,
Some overdosed, their lives rescinded.
Others slunk away, their names erased,
Fleeing the shame they couldn‚Äôt face.
Family and friends of the fallen pair,
Changed their names, disappeared from air.
A suicide here, a silence there,
A legacy of ruin, beyond repair.

As the good man sipped his coffee dark,
A smile crept in, a quiet spark.
Not from malice, but a knowing glance,
At the irony of the doll‚Äôs failed stance.

He recalled her words, bitter and low,
Racist jabs she‚Äôd let freely flow.
She‚Äôd mocked the dark-skinned man in his care,
The very one she later ensnared.
‚ÄúHow ironic,‚Äù he mused, shaking his head,
‚ÄúAt her hypocrisy, now that she‚Äôs dead‚Äî
Not in body, but in soul, in pride,
Her own cruelty the thorn in her side.‚Äù

And yet he thought of her final days,
Her life of self-destruction and haze.
She was cruel, conniving, empty inside,
But her choices left her hollow, not dignified.
A wreck of a woman who chose the abyss,
Trading love for vengeance that wouldn‚Äôt exist.

He set his mug down, rose with grace,
A sense of calm upon his face.
He‚Äôd survived the storm, endured the pain,
And vowed he‚Äôd never look back again.

For justice had come, and though it was grim,
It left him whole, untouched by sin.
His family, his name, unbroken, alive,
While those who betrayed him failed to survive.

The future awaited, bright and wide,
No ghosts, no shadows, no hate inside.
The good man smiled as he walked away,
At peace with himself, a brand-new day.",1,1736569384.0,Poem,0,1.0,False

I was wondering if substituting the baking soda with more baking powder would work or is it still gonna turn out bad. I specifically searched for dutch process cocoa powder recipes but they all seem to have a softer structure and they're not as tall as I would like for a 3 layer cake.

I can try to get natural cocoa powder (which I know seems like the easiest way to go) if I absolutely have to but because I don't have much time I just wanted to know if there was a way to adapt this recipe.",2,1736569275.0,Baking,1,1.0,False

I got the Vertuo Next from Costco, and don't care for the overly foamy ""crema"" output. 

After more research and not pulling the trigger on a Breville Barista Impress Express, I got the Breville Creatista Pro. Disappointed at first that all the videos I watched happened to be the UK version (double heating element) simultaneously brew and froth. But I'm working my way past that. Now I'm trying to perfect my flat white, and it needs a double shot espresso. Watching the UK video on a flat white and he just hits the espresso + for another shot to run. 

On the US version of this machine, that + doesnt come up. Is there another trick? What's the answer? Would you just do first capsule as a standard  espresso pull, then drop the next capsule and then do the flat white? Kind of a bummer because they (Nespresso/Breville) know a flat white should have 2 shots espresso. Thanks. Side note pretty darn happy with the quality of the milk temp and frothing quality.

We hit it off and shut down Starbucks lol. Neither of us had realized how much time had passed. When is a good time to mention my ex-wife? I wasn't planning to just drop this information on date 2 or anything but my ex-wife is...just a lot...she constantly finds ways to cause issues, we argue often, she can be very mean and never hesitates to cause a scene. I have 2 kids which this new woman is aware of. I'm worried my ex will find out somehow that I'm dating again and I don't want this new woman to be shocked or surprised or worse yet lose a chance to turning into a real relationship. 

An example of my ex doing insane things to interfere in my life. My last girlfriend, she did a full background check on her, called my entire family to tell them that my new girlfriend wasn't divorced yet officially (which I knew about prior to my ex announcing it) and that she was a cheater because she was still legally married. It completely embarrassed my new girlfriend. I just don't want to see that happen again to another innocent possible girlfriend.

I (27M) and my girlfriend (28F, Latin)  have been together for 2-3 years. After a few years, she started mentioning that she doesn‚Äôt feel the spark like she used to. Initially, she suggested that we move in together to see if it would help. However, about a month ago, she brought up the same concerns again. I suggested we move in together and see how things go. I told her that if it doesn‚Äôt work, we can go our separate ways. And she always says that I‚Äôm not the problem that she is, and I asked her tell me if I‚Äôm doing something wrong so I can fix it and she said it her not me, and she said that she doesn‚Äôt wanna waste my time as well, also she doesn‚Äôt msg any other perosn. she said she wants to be sure that I‚Äôm the person that she wanna spend the entire life with me and marry and move on, I get that moving to different country is hard and you to start from beginning from buying a house when compared to seeing friend getting married back home and feeling lack behind. 

We are from two different countries, and I work two jobs, which leaves me tired all the time. Despite that, I always try to make time for her‚Äîgoing out together, opening the door for her, making food, buying her flowers, writing small notes and letters, and doing all those thoughtful things. The job market has been tough, and I haven‚Äôt been able to secure a position in the IT industry, so I‚Äôm currently working at a coffee shop.

Recently, she visited her home country and messaged me occasionally, sharing pictures. Two days ago, we exchanged messages in the morning, but she didn‚Äôt respond for the rest of the day. I called her twice, but she didn‚Äôt pick up. The next day, she messaged me as if nothing had happened, replying to my previous messages.

I called her to ask what was going on. She explained that she had met with her doctor and then spent time with her friends. I was upset and told her that a relationship takes effort from both sides‚Äîit can‚Äôt work if only one person is trying. After that, we talked normally, but I hung up. She hasn‚Äôt messaged me since, and it‚Äôs been two days now. She‚Äôs coming back in two days, and we live separately. I was the one who dropped her off at the airport, and I‚Äôm supposed to pick her up as well.

Should I call her and talk to her normally, or should I wait for her to message me first? If she doesn‚Äôt message me back, should I just let it go?


TL;DR: My girlfriend (28F) has been expressing doubts about our future after 2-3 years together, and I‚Äôm unsure how to handle it. How should I approach this situation? Should I give her more time, or is there another way to support her through her concerns?",4,1736569065.0,relationships,1,1.0,False
