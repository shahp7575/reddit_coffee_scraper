The Fix Was a Single Character.,"So, picture this. I'm working on this huge, mission-critical feature for a client. The deadline is breathing down my neck, and the project manager is starting to use that *voice*. You know the one. The feature is supposed to process a bunch of data and send a neat little package to a server. But it's not working. And when I say 'not working,' I mean it's failing so silently it's spooky. No errors, no crash logs, no network traffic... nothing. The data just vanishes into the ether.

My first thought? 'Okay, must be a simple networking issue.' I spend the next few hours checking firewalls, ports, and server configs. Everything looks perfect. So I dive deeper. I'm tracing every single function call, stepping through the code line by line until my eyes bleed. I start going crazy, questioning everything. Is it a compiler bug? A weird memory leak? Did a solar flare flip a specific bit on the server at the exact wrong nanosecond? By day two, I'm fueled by cold coffee and pure desperation, convinced the universe has a personal grudge against me.

Finally, at my wit's end, I lean back in my chair and just stare at the screen, completely defeated. I decide to review the code from the absolute beginning one last time. I'm scrolling through the file that kicks the whole process off, a file I've already looked at a dozen times. But this time, my sleep-deprived brain sees it. A single line of code, the most important function call in the entire sequence, is sitting there, innocently grayed out. It looked like this: `;sendTheData();`. Yep. A single, accidental semicolon before the function call, which in this language (JavaScript) just created a valid, empty statement and effectively turned the most critical part of the feature into a comment.

I stared at it for a solid minute, a weird mix of rage, relief, and humiliation washing over me. I deleted the semicolon, hit 'run,' and everything worked perfectly. Two full days of frantic, high-stress debugging, solved by deleting a single character. I felt like the smartest idiot in the entire world.

The children screamed as they fell into a swirl of dream-like clouds and landed hard but not harmful on top of a New York city building. 

“Ouch!” Max shouted. “I guess these wings are just for show.”

“Did that really hurt you?” Tina asked.

“No, but the idea of it did. Force of habit I guess.” Max responded as Akari-Maria and Tina helped him up.

“Come take a look at this!” JJ gestured to them. “Welcome to New York City!” 

“No way! It’s more beautiful than I imagined.” Akari-Maria said. The children were facing out to the skyline, full of the typical New York lights but the skyline was made even more magical with Christmas lights abound in the city. 

“Come on! Let’s go solve this mission then I can show you all around!” JJ said, jumping off the building without a care. The children gasped in shock as JJ fell. “Don’t worry! It doesn't hurt!” He said, landing like the superheroes he idolized.

“Here goes nothing!” Tina shouted as she followed suit. Akari-Maria and Max did the same and laughed as they landed. “Thank you Auntie Cici and Unc!” Tina giggled.

“Okay we have to get to Brooklyn. We’re right at the bridge. We can take bikes over then get our way to the apartment. Come on, let’s borrow some from this bike shop around the corner.” JJ said as he jogged up the block. The other children followed him. 

“Wouldn’t that be stealing?” Max asked.

“Not if we bring them back. Besides we’re Christmas spirits, I think the universe won’t mind us using them for a little while. I mean Auntie Cici and Unc are kind of embodiments of the universe. In a way, they gave us permission. We can ask them to return it to normal or something. They’re magic right?” JJ responded.

“I don’t think that’s how it works but we’re strapped for time so let’s just go. We have to come back this way anyway.” Akari-Maria added.

The children walked into the store and picked out the bike they loved the most and rode from the store in a fury of fun and determination. However, their joy was cut short when they noticed a man in a business suit noticing them. At first, they were weirded out by this man staring at them, especially when he dropped his coffee and briefcase to rub his eyes. But then Tina pointed out “oh no, we’re invisible but our bikes aren't!"" 

“Tina you’re right!” Akari-Maria said. “We can’t ride through the city like this!”

“New plan! The train!” JJ shouted as he popped a U-turn,

 

The children returned the bikes and made their way towards the nearest train station. With it being everyone’s first time except for JJ’s, the train ride was a source of laughter for him. The three of them had trouble standing up and kept knocking into people which caused others to get upset, because to all on the train, it looked like everyone was clumsy and knocking everyone over, but JJ knew it was his very green teammates causing the havoc.

They made it to their stop and found their way to the apartment. “Okay, pretty straight forward, we just have to wait until exactly 6:17p to prevent the catastrophe,” said Akari-Maria. 

“Right, but if we’re waiting right here, how can we prevent the catastrophe?” Tina asked.

“What do you mean? Auntie Cici said we have to stop the mom from using the stairs.” Akari-Maria retorted. 

“No, we have to keep the dad from using the side entrance.” Tina responded.

“Hang on, what’s this about a mom and dad? I thought we had to make sure the candles properly went out?” Max asked.

“I think we have different parts of the mission. I have to go!” JJ said in a sprint.

“I think he’s right!” Tina added. She too made her way towards the stairs. 

“I have to get into that apartment!” Max shouted as he went to bang on the door.

“Wait! How am I supposed to keep the mom from going downstairs?” Akari-Maria asked. 

“I don’t know! Turn yourself visible. I have to make sure that candle stays out!” Max blurted. 

The door opened to a middle aged woman who happened to be on her way out. Max, still invisible, snuck by her into the apartment. “Hello?” The woman asked. “I could’ve sworn somebody was knocking on this door. Okay kids, I’ll be back later, your father should be home soon. Make sure you blow the candles out before you go to bed, love you!” She shouted as she closed and locked the door. Akari-Maria, visibly nervous to us, stood frozen, unseen by the woman making her way towards the stairs. Akari-Maria followed behind her and closed her eyes to turn her halo light on, making herself visible to the people on this plane. 

Akari-Maria jumped towards the woman and pulled on her coat. The woman was startled and turned around to see Akari-Maria there. “Oh my, was that you knocking on my door before?” The woman asked. Akari-Maria made no sound. “Is everything okay sweety?” The woman said, kneeling down towards her. Akari-Maria just starred. “Can you talk honey? Are you hurt?” the woman asked. Akari-Maria, without thinking, said something in Japanese. The woman was confused but still comforted her. “Okay, I don’t understand you but I know someone who might.” The woman took Akari-Maria by the hand and tried to lead her towards the stairwell, but Akari-Maria resisted and pointed to her leg. The woman nodded her head to convey an understanding and suggested she carry her and use the elevator instead. Akari-Maria agreed and they waited for the elevator to arrive for them.

Tina made it downstairs and sprinted towards the side of the building. She saw the dad that was assigned to her heading towards the alley. She ran towards him and tried to nudge him in another direction, but the man just thought he was bumping into a mailbox as he was distracted reading his newspaper. She made another attempt by trying to trip him, but he only stumbled a little bit, blaming it on the uneven curb. Her final trick to prevent him from walking down the alley was to steal his newspaper and pretend it was floating in the wind. The man chased after it, passing the alley. Tina had the paper ‘float’ all the way to the front of the building, making him decide to use this entrance, rather than the side entrance’s short cut. Just as he passed the side of the building, debris from the neighboring construction site had fallen into the alley. The alley was closed off but the man still snuck into it because he believed it saved him time. He went to look back to see the loud bang and once he realized it would’ve been him crushed instead of the garbage can, he made a religious gesture and understood that the extra two minutes he saved were no longer worth it. Once in the lobby, he saw his wife holding Akari-Maria in her arms. “Hey love, who’s this?” He asked as he gave her a kiss on the cheek.

“I don’t know. She knocked on our door as I was leaving. I think she speaks Japanese; I’m going to take her over to Mrs. Yamada’s to find out what’s going on. What are you doing over here? Don’t you always take your life saving short cut?” 

“Not today. And not again until that construction is done. I’m just glad to see you.” 

At this point, Akari-Maria squirmed out of the woman’s arm and ran outside. The woman tried to chase after her but was too distracted by the loud bang and flashing of electricity coming from the stairwell. “What a weird two minutes,” the woman said with a curious face. 

Back in the apartment, Max cautiously waited in the living room for one of the kids to do what their mother asked and blow out the candles. Growing anxious that the children wouldn’t do it, Max made a loud noise to get their attention. This worked, as a teenager emerged, holding her 4 year sister in her arms. She placed the little girl down and blew out the candle then went to the fridge for a snack. She looked and smiled at the four year old and went back to her room. The four year old sat there for a moment then let out a mischievous smile as she went to climb onto the table that had candy on it. This is also the same table that had another candle on it that in fact was not fully blown out. Max, waiting in the living room for that candle to reignite, hadn’t realized that the dining room table was the candle of concern. The flame had already come back to life and was positioned on the table’s runner, which the four year old used to climb to get to the candy. When she tugged on the runner, the candle fell, causing a small flame on some of the coloring paper that had been left behind. Max heard the thump and immediately ran to the table. He was shocked by the flame and froze for a brief moment until the four year old let out a cry. Snapping Max back into reality, he jumped at the vase with flowers on the table and dumped the water on the flame and quickly put it out. The teenager hearing all the commotion ran out of her room and saw the mess that she of course blamed on the four year old. The little one insisted that it wasn’t her fault and that a ghost was the one who caused it, but the teenager told her to stop lying and to help her clean up the mess. Max let out a sigh and left the apartment, accidentally letting the door slam behind him. “What was that?!” The teenager shouted. “See, told you it was a ghost.” The four year old yelled back.

JJ arrived to his post on the roof. However, the sign that Unc gave him to look out for was not what he expected. He located the clue and realized his mission was meant for three buildings over. He jumped off the roof again to make his escape quicker than running down the stairs. He bolted passed civilians, bringing with him a breeze that they mistook for the wind. He made it to the building, but the door was locked so he had to climb the fire escape. Climbing faster than he had in the past, JJ made it to the top just in time to see his mission walking towards the edge. 

“WAIT!” He yelled. 

A little boy no older than himself, turned around at the aggressive sound of the wind. 

“Hang on, just give me a moment!” JJ shouted again. 

The younger boy turned around again, believing the wind was now talking to him. 

JJ remembering that he was invisible, closed his eyes tight to turn his halo light on, making himself visible to the little boy on the roof.

“What the heck?!” The little boy shouted. “Who are you? What do you want?”

“I’m JJ, I’m here to help,” he said, still trying to catch his breath. 

“What are you supposed to be, some Christmas angel or something?” said the boy.

“Something like that. I’m a spirit but that’s not important. What is important is why you came up here.”

“If you’re some spirit then you know why I came up here. I’m sick of this life. I’m ready for the next one!” The boy shouted from the rooftop.

“Hold on, hold on. Let’s calm down a little bit. I think there’s still time to make this one a little better. Why don’t you tell me what’s going on. Just give me five minutes.” JJ said, holding out his hand. The kid looked at him and shook it. “I told you my name, what’s yours?”

“Daniel, but you can call me Danny.” Danny answered.

“Nice to meet you, Danny. Wanna fill me in?” JJ asked.

“You don’t know already? I thought you were a spirit.” Danny snarked.

“I’m not that kind of spirit. I just got my wings today and they don’t even work.” JJ responded while looking back at the wings.

“Well, it’s no secret. It feels like everyone knows and they don’t care. I’m living in this stupid group home because my dad made up a story about my mom abusing me. He said she’s not taking care of us because I was home alone and had to cook for myself. Of course I was home alone, she had to work because he ran off with one of his secretaries and left us again. He makes all that money on Wallstreet and can’t even send us a dime. I know how to cook. She taught me everything! But he just wants me to live with him and make her mad. I hate him! He doesn’t even do nothing with me when I go over his house. I’m by myself more over there than I am with my mom. And at least she loves me.” Danny said, pacing back and forth.

“I’m sorry Danny, that sounds awful.” JJ said.

“And it keeps getting worse. I finally met a friend at the group home. A real nice girl, she’s like 13 or something. Helped me write a letter to my mom telling her how much I miss her and stuff and how I wanna go back to Staten Island. Even let me cry in her lap and didn’t make fun of me like some of the church ladies did. So, I asked her how she ended up here and she told me that she was from a different state. She got moved all around and stuff. She said it was called something like a traffic jam or something, I don’t remember but I do remember she said she had a baby they took away from her. Can you believe it? A kid like me had a baby and they took it away from their mom just like they took me away from mine. What’s wrong with these people? They said they’re here to help but all they do is tell us how much stuff we do wrong. Those nun ladies, fake nuns really because the ones I know would never say something like that, kept saying how it was the girl’s fault for having the baby and that’s why it got taken away. What a mean thing to say. The girl didn’t even want the baby in the first place, but somebody made her have it. She said she almost died when she pushed her out. And then they take it away from her! Another one of the kids I met was smaller than me and had broken ribs because his mom and dad got mad at him because he was struggling with reading. Can you believe it? We’re kids! We’re not supposed to deal with nothing like this. So, you tell me why I shouldn’t jump off the building. What’s the point of it all? The priest said God has a plan, but what kind of a plan is this? Why do so many kids hurt and why do grownups say they care when they don’t?! They don’t listen to us, they never do!” Danny was now crying his words.

JJ gave Danny a big hug and just held him tightly. Danny didn’t resist at all. 

“I don’t want to die JJ but I don’t want to live like this no more. I just want my mommy. Why can’t I have my mommy?” Danny said as he cried into JJ’s chest. 

The boys stayed in each other’s arms in silence for about 5 minutes. “Why don’t you tell me some of the things you used to do with your mom?” JJ asked Danny. Danny wiped his eyes and began to list off a bunch of things he and his mother would do on the weekend. JJ then asked him to make a list of all the things that he wants to do with his mother when he gets older. He listed very sentimental things that he would look forward to. The boys laughed at some of the suggestions JJ made and talked a little longer before Danny thanked JJ for listening. As they made their way towards the stairwell. JJ said “You know the purpose of life is Christmas lights, right?”

“What?” Danny asked.

“The purpose of life is Christmas lights. It's what my gramma says to me. She actually says a bunch of different things like ‘the purpose of life is art’ or ‘the purpose of life is laughter’ what it means is life is always changing, sometimes it gets better and sometimes it gets worse, so you should always change its purpose to fit the need of the moment. I think for you ‘the purpose of life is Christmas lights’ means that you should take your new friends to see some Christmas lights. It’ll probably make their lives a little easier for now and then you can change life’s purpose to something else the next day. Like ‘the purpose of life is snowball fights.’ Or the purpose of life is to care for kids because some grownups don’t. Look Danny, I’m pretty new to this spirit stuff, so I hope this is helpful. But even if it’s not, I’m really glad you shared all the things you’re looking forward to. I really hope you get to enjoy life the way you want to.” 

“Thanks JJ. I’m really happy I had someone to really listen to me. You’re not so bad for a Christmas angel or spirit or whatever you are. I’ll check out that show Wayans Bros. it sounds pretty funny. And I guess I can give the purpose thing a try too. I think life’s purpose right now is some cookies and soda.” Danny said with a smile.

“I like the way you think, Danny. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!” JJ said as Danny walked down the stairs. 

JJ waited for the door to close before checking his watch for the time. He double checked because he only three minutes before he needed to get back to The Realm. In a rush of emotions, he went to jump off the roof to meet back up with his new friends. However, when he jumped, instead of doing a superhero landing like he had been practicing, he actually floated. “I can fly? I can fly!” He shouted as he soared through the cold December air. 

The rest of the team all met up in the air as it would appear by completing this mission, they all achieved the ability to use their wings.

“Okay, two more minutes before we trapped here, how are we going to get back to the meeting spot?!” Max shouted.

Just then, the quick change of a large clock, turning back four hours caught their eyes. A billboard of a woman, winked at the children.

“I think we’ll be alright!” Tina responded.

Now that they had more time, they were able to see the city in a timely manner and enjoy all the things JJ told them about before making it back to The Realm. Once back in The Realm, they shared their stories with Auntie Cici and Unc and laughed about how much fun they had. 

As the night went on, it grew closer for the team to return to their lives and wake up from the deep sleep they were in. They all said their goodbyes but not before exchanging information to send letters and make phone calls to each other until the following Christmas to help those in need once again. 

JJ finally woke up lying in a hospital bed with all his friends waiting for him. They cheered with joy when he made a quip about wanting a rematch in ice skating. They brought him some food, and the group resumed their new tradition of watching sitcoms until it was time for bed. It was indeed a Merry Christmas for JJ and his friends, the ones in Harlem and the ones across the world.

It was a different kind of noise here: the clatter of aging keyboards, the hum of servers, the low murmur of journalists negotiating with sources who didn’t want to be named.

Kareem Hassan sat in his glass-walled office at the far end, a fishbowl of stress amidst the open-plan chaos. He didn’t look up when Lena tapped on the doorframe. He just slid her printout across his desk. It was bleeding red ink.

“Paragraph four,” he said, finally looking at her over the rim of his glasses. “And seven. And the entire conclusion.”

“They’re accurate,” Lena said, stepping inside and closing the door.

“They’re suicide,” Kareem corrected. He tapped the paper with a nicotine-stained finger. “‘Systematic erasure of heritage’? ‘State-sponsored displacement’? Lena, we are a newspaper, not a manifesto. You want to get us shut down?”

“I want to tell the truth about Warraq. Fifteen thousand people are losing their homes.”

“Then tell the truth that can be printed.” He sighed, rubbing his temples. He looked older than fifty, worn down by decades of navigating the thin red lines of Egyptian media. “The Ministry is already breathing down our necks about the licensing renewal. I can’t run this. Soften the language. Focus on the ‘human cost of modernization’. Drop the accusations against the developer.”

Lena stiffened. “The developer *is* the story, Kareem. ‘New Horizon Development’ is a ghost. I tracked their ownership to a shell company in Cyprus. If we don’t mention them, we’re just reporting on the weather.”

“The developer,” he cut her off, his voice hard, “is a red line. We don’t have the legal budget to fight them. And I don’t have the energy.” He pushed the pages further toward her. “Fifteen hundred words. Sanitized. Or I kill the piece.”

Another algorithm executing its logic: survival over honesty.  
The curtain the prophet spoke of wasn’t just smoke; it was red ink.

She took the pages. “Fine.”

––––––––––

A few hours later and fifteen hundred words on Warraq. Revised. Sanitized. Her original language deemed “too strong” for a newspaper in Egypt.

Lena closed her laptop and sat in the dimming newsroom, listening to the call to prayer layer over itself as different mosques fell out of sync, creating strange harmonies that hadn’t been designed but emerged anyway from the overlapping declarations of faith.

She packed her satchel, nodded to the security guard on her way out—a different one now, the evening shift—and stepped back into the world.

The square at dusk was a different creature than at noon. The heat had broken enough to make movement bearable. Families emerged. The vendors switched from cold drinks to hot tea and roasted corn. The traffic remained insane, but the quality of the insanity changed—became almost festive.

Lena walked slowly this time, no deadline chasing her. She wasn’t ready to be pressed into humanity on the metro quite yet. She’d walk to the station the long way, around the square’s perimeter, giving herself time to decompress.

The obelisk rose before her, lit now by spotlights that turned the pink granite golden. The mad prophet was gone. Of course he was. She hadn’t really expected him to still be there, but some small part of her had wondered.

She tilted her head back, looking past the granite tip of the ancient stone, searching the sky. The sky was a hazy, grey-orange blanket, suffocating the horizon. Not a single star in sight.

And as she descended into the metro station, her phone buzzed. Unknown number.

She almost ignored it—probably spam—but opened it anyway.

Two lines, no signature:

*The rot starts locally.*  
*Follow the water.*

Below that: an encrypted file attachment.

She stared at the screen, frozen.

Prologue:

Forever Sonder

According to the Kuwa,

There is no beginning,

There is no end.

All there is, is the reimagining.

Immortality resides within the memory of a yesterday

The current moment of the now

And the glimpse of a dream for tomorrow.

For they are one in the same.

We are one and the same.

This is your story too –

Whether this has happened to you in the past,

Is happening to you in the now,

Or you’ll soon experience it,

You are the protagonist,

You’ve always been.

You are now a child of the Sun,

You’ve always been.

Goooood Eveninggggg my beautiful people! Tis the season to indeed be jolly! And yes, I said evening because we all know the joy of the season is just after the sun goes down and all of the lights come on and the decorations are beaming with the glorious kindness and friendship. I want to welcome you all to this joyous moment and thank you for lending your ear to a new but familiar Christmas tale. Let us enjoy this pocket of time together and let go of our fears and trade them for cheers! I will be your narrator on this lovely journey into the meaning of a smile and snowflakes gently falling to rest on your pretty little head. You can call me Auntie CiCi - more on my backstory when we get to Act II of this snowy tall tale! But without further ado, let’s get into it!

Our story begins with the cutest little ten year-old boy, JJ! On one December afternoon, JJ and a close friend of his, Vic, were walking through the busy streets of Harlem and came across an inescapable aspect of fate; a neighborhood bully. You see, JJ’s grandparents and their parents had been living in Harlem for 70 years, but JJ was from a town called Roosevelt on Long Island, New York. So, anytime he got the chance to visit the city, his little heart would be filled with all the joy in the world. New York City around Christmas time is one of the prettiest places you could ever be. The streets are filled with Christmas lights, the air has hints of hot chocolate, and the people are a little nicer than usual. Christmas time was JJ’s favorite time of year; nothing could get in the way of the warmth a Happy Holidays and wink from a jolly stranger could bring for JJ. That is until JJ and his friend ran into Kenny from 127th. 

Each day for the week JJ spent in Harlem, he and Vic would have to walk past Kenny from 127th and another 14 year-old boy, Ducky, while on their way to visit a friend JJ’s known since he was three, a precious little girl named Kiara. You see, JJ only saw his friends from Harlem during Christmas break and a few weeks in the summer. He and Vic would meet up first because Vic lived close to JJ’s grandparents and they would walk together to visit Kiara. But this year, that trip to Kiara would be a test of bravery and wit.

On the first encounter JJ had with Kenny, Kenny stopped JJ and Vic, making them pay a ‘crossing fee’. JJ and Vic resisted but Kenny lifted JJ up by his jacket and shook the loose singles JJ had out of his pocket. Vic decided it was just easier to give Kenny the $5 he had rather than be hung upside down. “You lucky it’s cold outside and I have my mittens on or I woulda smacked that big bald head of yours into next week! What kind of 14 year-old goes bald this early anyway!” JJ shouted as he was almost a block away from the bullies. Kenny heard this and chased after the boys but luckily, they got away. The second day, JJ had a clever idea and offered to give Kenny money for the fare before Kenny could even threaten him, however, the money he paid was counterfeit and had an image of Marlon Wayans smiling instead of George Washington. The fake money aided in their escape but only up to the point that prevented a meeting of fist-to-cuffs; they were both pelted with snowballs as they laughed at the thought of getting away. One hit Vic in the back of the knee, forcing him to buckle to the ground. And another hit JJ square in the back of the head, forcing him to hit the deck in a looney-toonarian fashion. On the third day, the boys brought in three accomplices and had them sneak up behind the bullies for an old trick of the trade. Two of the boys pants the bullies while the third kneeled behind them for them to be pushed over. However, the plan went a lot smoother in thought than in execution. Kenny and Ducky grabbed JJ and Vic as they went down so now there was a pile of young boys rolling around in the snow, all trying to get the upper hand on each other. In a fit of rage, Vic punched JJ in the nose thinking he was Kenny and Kenny had Ducky in a headlock believing this to be JJ. What snapped the boys out of it was a neighborhood Granny chasing the boys with a broom. “When I catch you, I’m gonna kill you twig head!” Kenny shouted at JJ as he was hit by the broom. “Not if I catch you first Baldy Brown! You better put that hat back on before you get brain freeze!” JJ shouted back, but not before running backwards into a parked car. 

The next day JJ was fired up to fight Kenny. Vic tried to talk him out of it, but JJ said “nah man, I can’t go out like no punk! I watched all the Rockies and Ninja Turtles last night and been shadowing boxing all morning! The only way he can defeat me is if the sun reflects off that shiny head of his!” “It’s not worth it, JJ, we can figure something else out.” “Nope nope! That big idiot is shaking people down in front of a children’s hospital. Who knows how many people he’s bothered. I’m gonna stop him!”

Full of energy, JJ pretended to fight the air all the way to the corner Kenny and Ducky stood on every day. JJ sprinted towards the boy, unexpectedly leaving behind Vic and the other three boys he brought for back up. In an instant, JJ broke into his worst Michael Jackson impression and kicked his leg up in the air and shouted “you aint bad! You aint nothin! You aint nothin! Come on with it!” and kicked his leg in the air again before putting up the most uncoordinated boxing stance anyone has ever seen. With the most serious of faces, he growled at his antagonist and took an unathletic lung at him.

Everyone, including Vic and JJ’s comrades burst into a hearty laugh. Ducky fell to the ground and Kenny had to lean over to keep himself up. JJ took this as the perfect opportunity to jump on Kenny’s back and try to choke him. But Kenny kept laughing and stood up to fling JJ into a pile of snow. 

JJ struggled to get up but Kenny offered a helping hand to pull him out. JJ smacked his hand away and rolled down the pile and clumsily stood up to attempt to fight again. He lunged again and Kenny held him back by grabbing his head. “Look man, I’m trying to apologize. I don’t want to fight you. I’m sorry for messing with you. Here, take your money back.” Stunned by the generous gesture, JJ stopped fighting which made him fall to the ground in a loud grunt. Kenny picked him back up and dusted him off. 

“Sorry?! What do you mean sorry? Why don’t you want to fight anymore?” JJ grunted

“Because it was stupid and I was wrong,” said Kenny.

“Why the change of heart?” JJ muttered as he relaxed his shoulders.

“I had a session with my therapist, and he showed me how hurtful I was being.” Kenny sighed.

“Therapist? I didn’t take you for the emotional type. I guess you got more than air in that big bald head of yours.” JJ said with a little more cheer than anger.

“Well, he’s actually my cousin, in college to become a therapist. But my family thought I should talk to him. The truth is, I was angry at the world. My brother is in this hospital and I overheard my grandma talking about how expensive his bill was going to be. I thought I could get some money to help cover it. I know it was stupid, but I was desperate.” Kenny said, rubbing his head.

“Oh man, your brother is in there? How long has it been?” asked JJ.

“Since the summer. He’s got what I had, Leukemia. I just finished treatment in October. My dad won’t tell me anything about him getting better and my mom just cries all the time. So, I’m left to cope on my own as my cousin would say.” Kenny softly chuckled.

“That sounds terrible. Now I feel awful for almost whooping ya ass.” JJ snickered.

Both boys chuckled. “Actually, the last few days made things a little better. I used that money I took from you guys to get some hotdogs for me and my brother. Then when I saw Marlon Wayans’ face on that fake money I put on the Wayans Bros and watched it with my brother. I haven’t heard him laugh like that in so long. And he saw us fight yesterday and asked me about it so I made up a lie and told him I had a snowball fight with some friends. His eyes lit up because we always had snowball fights before we both got sick. Thank you for that. And now I get to tell him about your Michael Jackson impersonation and show him how to do the moon walk. But I’m sure he saw it for himself.” Kenny pointed up at his brother’s room. Another bald little boy was there waving at the boys on the street. Everyone waved back.

“Hey! He looks like little Bill.” 

Kenny laughed again and put his hand out for JJ to shake. JJ took it and they both nodded at each other.

“If you’re not doing anything, me and the guys are going to go down to Bryant Square Park tomorrow and teach ourselves how to ice skate. You and mini Green Mile should come with us.” JJ said pointing at Ducky.

Kenny laughed and said “Yeah, that sounds like a plan. 10:30a?”

“I’ll see you there, Headie Murphy!”

Kenny laughed again. “Kenny. My name’s Kenny.”

“I’m JJ. We’ll see you down there.”

“Oh and one more thing, You dropped your watch yesterday. I wanted to make sure I got it back to you.”

“Thanks man, I can’t believe I lost it. You’re a life saver!” JJ jumped into Kenny’s arms and gave him a big hug. 

And just like that, the boys became friends. They met up for ice skating and had a blast. Afterwards they bought some pastries and coffee that eventually became hot chocolate after they all spat it out for being too bitter. They walked around Central Park and had snowball fight before taking the train back to Harlem where they went to JJ’s house and put a marathon of Wayans brothers movies and other sitcoms like Martin, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Living Single, Sister Sister, That’s So Raven, Kenan and Kel and other shows that made them laugh and fill the house with joy. 

The next day, the boys planned to do the same thing. They met for breakfast then rode the train down to 40th and grabbed their skates to finish the races they competed in the day before. The boys were no professionals, but they were pretty good. Unfortunately, with ice skating in NYC, after a while you’re only as good as the people around you. While coming around the bend for the final leg of a 3 lap race, an unexpected novice skater jumped in the way of JJ flying towards the finish line. JJ managed to dodge the skater but couldn’t miss the wall that kept everyone in. He thought he could clear it by jumping over it but just like in his fight with Kenny, he underestimated the natural order of big things vs. small things. He went flying, doing a flip in the air and becoming very acquainted with the tree that halted his flight path. Everyone rushed to his aid and did their best to wake him up, but JJ was out cold. It wasn’t long before EMS showed up and got him loaded up in the truck to take him to the very children’s hospital the group of boys met at.

1pbk7sb,https://i.redd.it/pelvy853wm4g1.jpeg,Can’t decide on my living room layout,"Hello. Me and my partner cannot come to an agreement on the layout of our living room and hoping someone could share some light on this. It’s very square shaped and has a window and two entranceways, as a result it feels like the layout is pretty much set in stone. We currently have a sofa along the right hand wall, with a low tv unit and tv in the centre of the left hand wall. This currently leaves the walls with the doors and windows on undisturbed. I would ideally like to incorporate a corner sofa (there’s 5 of us) and a sideboard unit for storage. He would like a fake fireplace wall with mantle etc. neither of us care about floor lamps and coffee tables etc. The tv doesn’t necessarily need to go above the fireplace either. And the door can be slightly obstructed as we don’t use it as a main door. 

So my question is, are any or all of these things possible? Is there a layout that would make most sense here? I’m at a loss.

1pbk6te,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1pbk6te/ideas_for_setup/,Ideas for setup,"I have a functional setup but need advice/ideas.

**Main workspace:**  
32"" curved monitor  
Sit/stand desk  
Bluetooth keyboard & mouse  
Gaming laptop with AMD Ryzen 5 (dates from 2019), 256GB internal - my daily driver  
Work-provided laptop for WFH  
HDMI switch   
EHD (HDD) attached 

**Second workspace (family photo scanning):**  
21.5"" iMac, Late 2013, that runs Catalina 10.15, 1TB internal  
It has NTFS+ installed  
Bluetooth keyboard & mouse  
Plustek Scanner

**When I travel or work from a coffee shop:**  
Dell laptop with Intel Core i5 (dates from 2017), 256GB internal

**Pros:**  
Love the curved monitor. I have Parsec on all four machines so I can remote in to any of them from any workstation.

**Struggles:**

(1) Gaming laptop runs all the productivity software I need and does it very well, but graphics card is not capable of running 2025-era STEAM games at a normal or high level. Also minimal disk space so games are running off the HDD.

(2) The 21.5"" iMac runs the scanner software (I'm working on a family photo scanning project), Opera, Cyberduck, Parsec, and is not capable of much else. The display is mint and I love how this machine looks. This was my daily driver until 2019 when I bought the gaming laptop. This iMac is so outdated, but the display is SO nice. It can't be upgraded past Catalina, so most new software won't run. 

(3) The Dell laptop was a refurbished used, probably was a corporate leased one. It's not high-end but just like my gaming laptop it is capable. It's not attached to any of my home setups so it is the most portable and easiest to take for travel and WFA locations (no tangle of cables or dongles to detach.) But, I'm not getting much use out of it. 

(4) Likely can't do any machine replacement until late 2026.  I've got to mainly work with what I've got. Planning one small upgrade which is replacing my external HDD with an SSD so STEAM games can run slightly better.

**Ideas - Opinions Needed:**

(1) Use the iMac mainly as a monitor via Parsec for the Dell and the gaming laptop (in other words, give up on using its Apple functions.)  I could continue using it for local disk storage.  Or I could continue to use it for the sole purpose of family photo scanning since it does work for that.  One concern is that Parsec might eventually stop supporting Catalina.  So far I've only found one working browser (it's an older version of Opera). FF, Chrome, and Safari all crash. As long as Cyberduck continues to work, I can move files to/from the cloud.

(2) I'm not sure if there's any advantage to trying to get more value out of the Dell. It's already meeting the need of having an easy/functional travel laptop. 

(3) When finances open up (maybe Black Friday sales in 2026?) it seems like the highest priority is replacing my daily driver gaming laptop with a new one that is more capable.  That would free up my current gaming laptop to either (a) become my new travel machine, or (b) replace the iMac entirely.  Maybe at that point it is the right time to sell the Dell while it can still be useful for someone?

(4) I am not miserly but I feel really badly that this iMac looks so good and has useable space, but I can't get more out of it. I've seen it listed for only about $100 used so it doesn't seem like there's a lot of benefit to selling it. I imagine it would go into the e-waste stream and at least hopefully be recycled.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Philadelphia Flyers vs. Pittsburgh Penguins: A Battle of Brains, Brawn, and (Occasional) Bumbling**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans where the Philadelphia Flyers (58.6% implied probability) square off against the Pittsburgh Penguins (44.9% implied probability) in a game that’s as much chess as it is hockey. The Flyers, favorites at -1.5 goals on the spread, are the disciplined tacticians of this matchup, while the Penguins, armed with Sidney Crosby’s 16 goals and a defense that plays like a Swiss watch, are the underdog with a “*we’ve done this before*” swagger. Let’s break it down with the precision of a Zamboni and the humor of a penguin trying to ice skate.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams

The Flyers’ defense is a fortress—ranked **5th in goals allowed**—but their offense is about as effective as a screen door on a submarine (*27th in goals scored*). Enter Trevor Zegras, the 24-point maestro, who’s been practicing like he’s prepping for a math final. Without him, the Flyers’ attack would be a toaster in a bakery: present, but useless. Yet here he is, leading the charge alongside Travis Konecny and Owen Tippett, giving the Flyers a flicker of hope to pierce the Penguins’ defense.

The Penguins, meanwhile, are the NHL’s version of a Swiss Army knife: sharp, efficient, and led by Crosby, who’s scoring like he’s auditioning for a Hall of Fame highlight reel. Their power play? A well-oiled machine that hums with the precision of a Timbit-sized engine. And let’s not forget Parker Wotherspoon and Erik Karlsson’s defensive pairing, which allows goals like a locked vault allows thieves—*not often*.

---

### News Digest: Injuries, History, and a Dash of Drama

The Flyers’ big news? Zegras is active, and Dan Vladař is playing like a goalie who’s had a few too many coffee shots (*2.43 GAA, .912 save %*). Their recent 4-game road trip? A 3-1-0 romp, including a 5-3 win over the Devils that had the energy of a middle-schooler on a sugar rush.

The Penguins, though, are the definition of “*aging rock stars still nailing the encore*.” Crosby’s 16 goals this season are only trailing a sele

The next phase of the Solflare Card rewards is here and it’s powered by you: **our community.**

And yes… the grand prize is a **Porsche 911 GT3**.

Let’s hit the gas. 🏎️↓  


*It’s simple:*

Buy coffee, book a flight, eat out, maybe even buy another Seeker - all with your Solflare Card.  


Each swipe adds to the community spend, earning you points (and bragging rights).  


Points = entries.

Entries = a shot at a Porsche 911 GT3.   


You watch the spend climb…

You swipe more…  


And when we unlock it as a community, your entries have an equal chance to hit the jackpot.  


As the total community spend climbs, new car rewards unlock.

You’ll start humble, then level up to greatness - hint: it's the supercar mentioned before.

The silhouettes reveal themselves one by one as milestones are hit.



*Spend. Climb. Unlock. Repeat.*  


**How it works:**

1️⃣ Complete KYC (if you haven’t already, takes 2 minutes)

2️⃣ Get your Solflare Card (in participating countries)

3️⃣ Spend normally

4️⃣ Watch your points (and rank) climb the leaderboard

5️⃣ May the odds be in your favor

  
When it’s over, the leaderboard turns into a raffle and random Solflare cardholders turn into drivers.



You were gonna spend anyway.

Might as well make it count.



""Get in frens, we’re going swiping.""

I'm moderately athletic, extroverted, and apparently give off ""calm forest wizard"" energy. People tell me I'm easy to talk to, probably because I genuinely love those conversations that hang around in your brain for days like an unbothered cat on a windowsill.

What I'm looking for: A cuddle buddy. A snuggle homie. A professional-grade human burrito. Someone who enjoys affectionate, comforting closeness that's not about sex. Think: movies, deep chats, mutual decompression, head-on-chest moments, and that silent ""wow, existing is kinda nice"" feeling. I'm also open to more intimate cuddles or connection within boundaries, but I'm not looking to go past that.

We'd meet in public first, coffee, a chill walk, something that won't make either of us feel like we're auditioning for a Netflix true-crime episode.

Open my draw to find my coffees is practically gone. And the draws been quite obviously rummaged through. I've not locked my draws (until now) due to we have our own desks, there's no hot desking and I don't keep valuables at work anyway so I thought no need I just keep a few “life saver” bits in there just incase I need it. 


Found out from a co worker that he noticed the guy (who has always given me odd vibes from day one) was going in and out my draws while I was away. So I assume it's him. We have coffee in the kitchen for everyone to use, I only get my own as its the only instant coffee that doesn't stain my teeth. he's never been warm towards me, has always made me feel uneasy he's not done anything particular his vibes just off. I've never said he can use my coffee, he's also never asked to use my coffee. He'll happily use the coffee in the kitchen when I'm in the office I know this as he sits opposite to me. I really don't understand why he thinks it's okay to go into someone's desk draws and take things behind their back? (obviously if this was in the kitchen area or I left it in the open im asking for it but it was hidden away in my draws) 


I've only got one draw that locks and I've put everything in there and locked it taken the key with me. It is just coffee but the principal is a little weird to me. I've left a note in the original draw saying “there's coffee in the kitchen”. Don't really know best way to go about this as like I've said it's just coffee but doesn't sit right with me he's gone through my stuff without my knowledge?

1pbjvtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialNtelligence/comments/1pbjvtv/a_simple_discussion/,A simple discussion...,"We were in a coffee lounge working on our businesses when my girlfriend went outdoor to have a break. While she was scrolling on her phone, a homeless person walk in front of her, and ask her ""who invented the phone ?"", she didn't know so the guy said ""who he was trying to call anyway?"".

Following that, they had a conversation about how people were hypnotised by screens in general and leaving human interaction behind them. Then sharing his story: why is he living in the street, where he is coming from etc...

When she came back to me, she looked at me happy, explaining me the conversation she just had with someone who has nothing anymore than his thoughts to express, with no bad intentions, just a simple discussion.

Bear in mind, we both talk a lot about human interaction, how tech is taking over that and the future world we are going to. The question in my mind after that story was why some of the most honest questions come from people who have nothing to lose? And screen time was the first point, he has no phone or distractions following him everyday. Yes he doesn't have money today but he sees people passing in front of him with phones in front of them so he must knows what he is talking about.

And to be fair, he is right. Communication became zero or AI automated. Like we forgot how to write or speak to each other (I am half-including myself into that). Tech industry increased so much since OpenAI, new gens are growing with that and I have a guilty feeling about continuing without expressing the truth: we are just lazy to make changes (knowing that human is not the one to blame fully but the amount/speed of information, ads etc... absorbed by us make us less productive).

He needed to stay away from it and anyone who associated with it.

He’d always heeded those warnings, so it was with some hesitation that the 19-year-old from Tilton walked into Sanctuary Alternative Treatment Center, a medical cannabis dispensary in Plymouth, for the first time.

Suddenly, the thing he’d been told to avoid his entire life was recommended to him by a doctor. He was wary but willing to try it after having bad reactions to other medications he tried to treat a genetic disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

“That shift was kind of weird,” Jean said. “I remember getting driven home from the local medicinal dispensary and being like, this feels like I’m doing something wrong, even though it’s all legal in that sense.”

Recreational marijuana use remains illegal in New Hampshire, where cannabis is only allowed for medical use by patients who’ve been certified by a doctor and issued a special identification card by the state government.

The Granite State is on an island in New England due to its continual prohibition on selling and cultivating marijuana. Despite bipartisan legislative successes in the House to legalize the drug, those efforts have repeatedly been killed in the state Senate. Moreover, Gov. Kelly Ayotte has promised to veto any bill that would make marijuana widely available.

State lawmakers have expanded the therapy program in several spurts over the past 12 years, adding to the list of symptoms and conditions that make someone eligible to try cannabis as medicine.

Jean, now 21, started using cannabis early in 2024 at the suggestion of his doctor. His medical condition affects connective tissues in the body and causes fragile and hypermobile joints, meaning even small movements — a bump in the road, a sneeze, drinking coffee — can cause Jean to pull a muscle or dislocate a joint.

Like others in the program, cannabis wasn’t Jean’s first attempt at pain relief. He’d had serious negative reactions to other medications.

When he tried cannabis, Jean quickly saw improvements. It keeps his pain to a minimum, helps him sleep through the night and allows him to eat a full meal.

It took a few months for Jean to come to terms with how cannabis changed his life.

“For the longest time, it was that kind of mental block where it’s like, maybe I didn’t want to realize it was helping me because this whole time of being told, ‘This is a bad thing. We’ve got to get rid of it. We’ve got to make sure no one takes it,'” Jean said. “And then it’s like, ‘Oh, but I can sit without back pain now.'”

# Back on the table

As a child, doctors told Jean his ailments were just growing pains, but his symptoms came to a head in his senior year of high school, when Jean couldn’t keep up with all the things his peers were doing.

“I’m coming home and I’m immediately going to bed,” Jean remembered. “A normal 17-year-old should be able to handle a school day and not immediately crash out.”

Life with Ehlers-Danlos can be uncertain and limiting, as the course of Jean’s day can change at any moment. He decided not to go to college because of it, and he doesn’t drive out of fear that his knees will lock up and potentially endanger others.

As a kid, he used to play soccer and the drums, but the physical movement those hobbies required eventually took them off the table.

“With the cannabis program, now I’m able to kind of slowly dip my feet back in the water, whether it be playing drums or trying to be a little more active, getting more exercise,” Jean said. “It has made the transition into being able to do things a lot smoother.”

Jean said he knows he’s not the ideal candidate for a traditional job, what with the unpredictability of his condition. So, he’s taken over the spare bedroom of his family’s house to set up shop for his clothing company, Visionless Society. He makes the T-shirts and hoodies, designed by his girlfriend, by hand. He’s also taking business classes online.

Those efforts are possible, in part, because medical marijuana has given Jean time and energy back in his day, he said. Previously, injuries would completely debilitate him from even sitting up in bed. Now, even if he’s bedridden for a bit, he still feels well enough to get things done.

“If I pull a muscle or if a joint pops out of place, it’ll definitely lower the injury timeframe,” Jean said. “It also kind of puts your body in more of a relaxed state so you’re able to kind of get that healing process going quicker.”

# Green growth

Jean is among a minority of medical marijuana users in New Hampshire — one of roughly 3.2% of patients under the age of 26, according to data from the program’s annual report. More than half of registered users are over age 56.

The state has 112 other patients who use marijuana for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

The therapeutic cannabis program, established in 2013, serves nearly 15,000 patients. The production, sale and consumption of medical marijuana are heavily regulated by state law and an oversight board.

Though more patients continue to qualify and enter the state’s program, some say that high costs and distant locations of dispensaries across New Hampshire make medical marijuana products difficult to get.

Some lawmakers have tried to increase the possession limit, allow patients to cultivate cannabis at home and install other methods to increase access to the program. Those are typically stymied by an influential group of Republican state senators, who argue that expansions like higher possession limits would make it harder to regulate and enforce the program’s rules. Other lawmakers say they worry about misuse or illegal sale of medical cannabis, putting the drug in the hands of those who aren’t authorized to use it.

Jean said he’s a “big proponent” of the program — he hasn’t gotten addicted to marijuana or anything else, like he’d always been told he would, he said.

Still, he’s careful with it. When he started taking cannabis, he sat down with his 15-year-old sister to explain that, like any of his other medications, it would be off limits.

Aside from his own worries, which have largely subsided, Jean said New Hampshire’s strict lines of what’s allowed and what’s not can be a source of stress. For example, even certified patients like Jean must be careful about where they consume cannabis.

He said he always makes sure to carry his state-issued identification card. He sometimes keeps a vape in his pocket and hesitates to use it outside of the house, but he still worries someone could give him a hard time.

“That crosses my mind pretty consistently. I try to be very respectful about it … but it’s still like, ‘Oh, what if someone has an issue with it?'” Jean said. “You definitely still feel the, almost, anxiety aspect of it because it is still a thing that is in a kind of gray area, limbo state.”

Granted, these are small, non-mechanical switches, but I think it's hard to beat for a travel ergo keyboard when size and weight are a priority. I searched the sub and didn't find any other posts about it, so here is my ""review"".

* Cheap and readily available. They retail for $50, but can be found on eBay under $20.
* Super lightweight: 0.31lbs / 4.9oz / 141g
* Very compact
* Split, angled layout is way more comfortable than a laptop keyboard
* Quick switching between 3 bluetooth profiles
* Can be charged and used at the same time
* Durable
* Tenting could easily be added via adhesive legs

  
**Cons:**

* Membrane keys (for some, this is a plus for working in public places)
* Staggered, non-columnar layout
* No dedicated escape key (triggered with Fn + backtick)
* No customization software that I have been able to find
* Fixed split angle

TL;DR - my girlfriend and I have been together for 6 years but our personalities, interests, and plans for the future have just become too different and I don't think we're compatible anymore. I've never broken up with anyone before and have no idea how.

Background: I met my girlfriend in college when we were freshmen. We hit it off quickly and ended up dating not long after we met, and we just had our 6 year anniversary. We had some things in common but also a lot of things about us were different like our other interests and some aspects of our personalities. But opposites attract, right? Anyways, she ended up transferring at the end of the year so we did long distance. Due to our various obligations, we only got to see each other once or twice a year. I thought things were going great. I wanted to spend my life with her. We've met each others' friends and families, so we're really intertwined. We've gone through so much together (family deaths etc) and she's always been there to support me, and I for her. I've grown so much throughout this relationship with her by my side and I will always appreciate and value our time together and her support that allowed me to come into my own.

Up until about 6 months ago, I wanted to spend my life with her. We had vague plans of moving together once we graduated, plans for what our house would look like, kids, pets, all that. But now, I'm not so sure. Little things have been building up and approaching resentment. I graduated May 2024 and it took me almost 6 months to find a job. I applied to at least fifty ""decent"" jobs before swallowing my pride and applying to a fast food place. It sucks and it feels like I'm wasting my student loans, but it's money. She graduated this past January (2025) and still does not have a job, and it does not seem like she'll be getting one any time soon. She's putting in next to no effort to look for jobs, and therefore does not have any money to put towards a move together. She also has not shown commitment in wanting to move in with me. Everything I suggest, she shoots down with no real reason, feedback, or suggestions of her own. I can't handle long distance any longer. I want to see my girlfriend not in a phone screen. She doesn't seem to feel the same way.

It also feels like we've grown apart. At the start of our relationship, our differences were a positive, but now we're just \*so\* different that it feels like we have almost no common ground. I'm more extroverted and like to travel, try new restaurants, go hiking and kayaking and other outdoor activities, while she is very much a homebody and is content with just watching movies and getting takeout. When we've been together, we haven't gone on traditional dinner/brunch/coffee etc dates because she didn't want to, she just wasn't interested. This lack of a compromise has started getting to me, and it feels like I'm being held back almost? Like I can't do the things I enjoy because she doesn't want to, or at the very least I can't share them with her. When I do get her out, she's disengaged and seems bored, and she doesn't seem to be interested even when I try to involve her. I also have a plan for the future, and she doesn't. I'm volunteering with local organizations related to my degree to get experience and connections. I have a specific job in mind and ideas of how to get to that point. She has no clue what she wants to do, and doesn't really seem to think that it's important to even think about these things. This lack of ambition also sets us apart, and I think that our futures, whatever they may mean, aren't compatible. It feels like we aren't compatible as a couple at all anymore.

The last point is her mental health. It's always been bad but it's getting worse and it's really weighing on me. I won't go into detail out of respect for her, but I constantly worry that I'm going to wake up one day to her having done something and it terrifies me. I'm walking on eggshells around her to not upset her, and it feels like I can't discuss my own problems with her because she's already going through something and I don't want to add to it. And I know that if I break up with her, it's likely that she would do something drastic. I know that having that as a reason to stay with her isn't healthy; my friend said that if I'm thinking like that, then the relationship is already over.

The final push that made me realize that our relationship is basically over is a friend I made recently (no, I'm not leaving her just to get with him). We've only known each other for about 2 months, but he's already put in effort to learning about my interests and remembers things that my girlfriend still hasn't after 6 years of being together (my favorite hiking trails, the names of my coworkers etc). This has made me realize that there are people out there who might be better for me: more in line with my goals for the future, more similar in interests or at least more willing to participate in them with me, and someone willing to make a commitment.

But this is so unbelievably scary. She's all I've known for the past 6 years, and we're so involved in each others' lives (my parents LOVE her). It's like I can't imagine a future without her, but I also can't imagine one with her where I'm happy and fulfilled. I want to minimize the hurt because I do still care about her deeply, I always will. I want to stop stringing her along and give us the opportunity now to move on. I've never broken up with anyone before. What do I say? How do I bring it up? It has to be over text unfortunately. EDIT: We are still long distance and cannot meet face to face.

1pbjor6,https://www.reddit.com/r/expo/comments/1pbjor6/i_built_a_simple_crop_management_app_to_solve_a/,I built a simple crop management app to solve a problem I saw on my dad's coffee farm,"My dad and grandfather run a coffee farm in Brazil, and for years they've been tracking everything on paper: irrigation, pesticides, fertilizers, harvests. At the end of each season, they'd spend days trying to organize scattered notes and messy spreadsheets. It was frustrating and time-consuming.

The problem is that they're not tech-savvy, and most farm management software out there is way too complex for their needs.

So I built **Demeter**, a simple and intuitive mobile app designed for small and medium farmers who just want to record what happens in the field without dealing with complicated tools.

**What you can track:**

* Irrigation
* Defensives (pesticides/herbicides)
* Nutrition (fertilizers)
* Harvesting

The app is currently in Portuguese and focused on Brazilian farmers, but if there's enough interest, I'd love to create an English version.

I'd really appreciate your feedback. Does something like this sound useful? What features would you want to see in a farm management app?

Backstory: my mom left *7* big storage units of stuff when she died. There’s a lot of beautiful things, but sheesh the VOLUME. And a lot of it is in categories that aren’t very in-demand, like fine china & crystal, handmade art glass & pottery, a ton of beautiful serveware, linens etc (she was a chef/caterer) as well as hundreds of fine books/coffee table books/cookbooks & probably thousands of old decorating & cooking magazines. Oh, and a lot of clothes, from random casual stuff to designer. Due to the amount of stuff, I can’t hire a company to do a big blowout sale — it wouldn’t all fit in my house, especially with me living there. 

I seem to be doing ok pricing things at about 30% of online sales prices (prices of things that actually sold within the past year) averaging between eBay, Poshmark, replacements, & local Chairish). But I have some things that are lingering, especially colored crystal and some of the nicest china. These are selling for hundreds of $$ online, but I worry that it’s too much for estate shoppers. 

Is it worth putting the nicer stuff on Chairish etc? I hate eBay because if you don’t sponsor your ads go nowhere, but I’m not as familiar with Chairish. 

How do I price things to sell pretty quickly, without losing thousands of dollars?

Also, for designer/nice clothes like Ralph Lauren, Escada, St John, great vintage stuff and cashmere/leather items, is it better to sell individually on Poshmark? Or how do I go about it?

And finally, the books! I see stacks of pretty leather bound books or coffee table books selling well online, but at estate sales near me I mostly see paperbacks/modern hardbacks etc. How do I know how to group & price them? By the whole collection? Groups of 5-10? Sell by leather color like some do? And I’m planning to offer mags for 20 cents each — will anyone buy them or should I just trash them all?",1,1764611676.0,estatesales,2,1.0,False

She has always been very persistent and pushy and made a huge effort to keep in touch with me. Her only child has lived away in boarding school most of her student life and her husband works in a different country. She has multiple properties here and there and extremely well connected. Even though she’s educated, she relies on the rent and managing her properties and her husband‘s properties for her source of income.
I on the other hand and am an artist with two young children and a husband who runs his own business. We are hard-working and self-made, and I spent a lot of time supporting him and his business. I lost my mother in my mid-20s and my father when I was 11. For reason, I often turned to older friends for advice and support. This friend of mine has been extremely critical of my support of my husband and often comments that I should not be helping out with his business. I don’t financially contribute to the family and deeply appreciate how much my husband does to make us all so comfortable. I find it my duty to help him out whenever I think I can be of use. she has commented on my children many times as well as spent most of our time talking ill of every single person around us. She will talk about the person as soon as they leave the room. At the same time, she has supported my career and appreciates my work a lot. She has curated my work in a few shows. All of this has come from her and not been my initiative. I just never say no to her and send out a few pieces for her to exhibit. She has made me so uncomfortable at so many occasions, but I have not spoken up because of her anger. Last week I had had enough. She was going around advocating on my behalf to members of our Artist community who I have a huge amount of respect for. The next days you sent me over 50 messages and multiple voice notes and I had had enough. I responded with one line saying I am dealing with a lot right now. I will get back to you tomorrow. My daughter had food poisoning and I had to rush to the ER. The next day, this friend of mine messaged me again and I told her: sorry I am busy with my daughter she is unwell. her first reaction was: well your Instagram stories say elsewise. Early that morning before my daughter got sick. I had posted on my story two pictures of myself and my friend out having coffee. 
For the first time in my life, I was so enraged  that I immediately wrote back saying that are you 15 years old? Do you not understand that something bad can happen 10 minutes 20 minutes or an hour after you post something on your story? Don’t you think that me telling you that my daughter is sick is good enough. She replied by saying that she is so hurt by my anger and that she was only coming from a place of concern. I told her not to flip this and I am exhausted from a negative energy and I cannot deal with this anymore. I then went on to block her.
Even though I feel so so so good without her constant nagging and negative energy and judgment of everything I do. Her delegating work to me across the sea. Her sending me reading material every few hours and links to essay and demanding that I read them. I am educated well read person, and I have my own references that I look at for my inspiration. Even though I feel so light so fresh and so good and so ready to mend my bruised relationships that she is responsible for, I still feel guilty that I have blocked her. 

Part of me wants to write her an email and explain once again why did what I did. But I don’t want to let her think that it was me having a bad day because it wasn’t me having a bad day it was her behaving badly with me. Did I do the right thing?

There are no exceptions. No one wants the TV show, movie, podcast, song or conversation interrupted by an advertiser. When it happens, it almost exclusively generates negative impressions of the brand. This is why most users find ways to avoid ads. So why are brands spending real money on something that most people are ignoring and everyone else hates? Isn't that bad for their business. It sure is...but influence peddling is so effective that it doesn't matter.


Advertisers aren't really paying for the ad. They are actually paying for the space between the ads. The products that advertise on NBC are the same products on the shelves in the background of every SNL sketch. Starbucks pays for a banner ad in the corner of CNN.com that no one ever clicks on and in exchange then get articles like these:

https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/27/food/starbucks-changes-refills


All of these articles are forms of native-advertising, marketing content that's designed to look like real content. The whole ""enshitification"" of the internet thing is just Corey Doctorow, a guy aggressively marketing his book on the internet, rebranding the same old problem that the internet has: we have a spam problem.

When someone has hundreds or thousands of advertisers paying them and they eventually need to generate and promote a large amount of content for them, often about topics they don't actually understand. I believe this explains why ad-supported platforms are the ones filling up with slop the fastest. My theory is that the slop is a necessary by-product of advertising schemes. As YouTube fills up with this slop, the value of paying them to hide the ""ads"" decreases since you're still being exposed to an escalating amount of native-advertising.


tl;dr - Advertisers influence the content between the ads. Paying YouTube to hide the ads, doesn't hide all the native-advertising. The influence behind the advertisers seems to explain the least organic behavior on the platform.",1,1764611441.0,conspiracy_commons,3,1.0,False

✨ Things I need help with:

* Finding the most suitable rug for the space - Recommendations for the best possible carpet for this room (size, color, pattern, material)
* Wall decor (artwork, mirrors, shelves, etc.)

* For all complementary items such as decoration, style, objects, paintings, mirrors, shelves, side tables. These pieces of furniture will remain, so I'm looking for ideas that complement them. The coffee table between the two chairs will be removed. (six-basket coffee table) Please suggest another coffee table. Of course, take my center table into consideration as well. Because I will be getting a coffee table to place right next to my table. I haven't bought it yet. I'm not sure if I should get the anthracite gray coffee table shown in the catalog. I'm open to other suggestions as well.

I want to create an aesthetically pleasing look.

I am open to any honest criticism, adjustments (as long as the fixed elements remain unchanged), and any creative ideas that could improve the atmosphere of the room.

1pbjgrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeralaRelationships/comments/1pbjgrr/bumble_date_haunted_me/,Bumble Date — Haunted Me,"I was bored, so I downloaded Bumble on my phone. Within two hours, I had many likes.
I was staying in a port town in Kochi. There, I saw a guy named Dev, 24 years old, just 5 km away.
He was short, fair, chocolate-boy type. I swiped right. We matched instantly.

We started chatting—basic things at first, and the conversation felt smooth.
He said he was sitting in a café just 2 km from where I stayed, and asked if I could join him for a coffee.
He had a car.
I hesitated… but then thought “It’s just coffee, and he seems fine.”
He specifically asked to choose a place where people were around, so I felt safe and agreed.

Dev came to pick me up, and we went to the café.
The conversation was going great. At some point, I mentioned my obsession with horror and psychological stories.

Suddenly, he said,

> “I know a place nearby… extremely haunted. I’ve been there with my friends once.”



He looked so normal and trustworthy, so I said yes.
The time was around 7 PM when he started driving.

We drove through the town, then slowly left the city lights behind.
The road became narrower—no street lights, no houses.
Just trees on both sides, bending like dark fingers over the car.
I noticed silent couples parked along the way… staring blankly.

Soon the road turned into a single-lane path where two vehicles couldn’t pass.
If one came from the opposite direction, we would have to reverse nearly 1 km back.

Gradually, houses disappeared completely.
By the time we reached the top of the hill, it was 8 PM, but it felt like midnight.

Ahead of us, about 50 meters away, was an old iron gate, wide open.
Behind it stood a massive, broken mansion.
The walls were covered with hundreds of crosses—small, large, carved, painted… everywhere.
I had never seen anything like it. Something felt wrong.

Dev whispered,

> “People live here… but neighbours say they never see them outside. There’s a man who walks around here at night. Looks strange.”



My chest tightened. My hands turned cold.
I said,

> “Dev, please… let’s leave. I’m getting a very bad feeling.”



He nodded,

> “Okay, okay. If you’re uncomfortable, we’ll go.”



Just as he was about to turn the car, I saw him.

A man.
Standing at the gate.
Over 6 feet tall, with a long tangled beard, pale skin, and glowing red eyes.
His stare sliced through the darkness.
His smile—unnatural, stretched, monstrous.

He began walking toward us, slowly… step by step.
Not running.
Just walking.
But it felt like death itself was moving closer.

I started crying, shaking, unable to breathe.
Dev saw him too. His face went pale.
He quickly pulled the steering and did a U-turn.
The tires screeched, and the car flew forward.

I looked back.

The man was still walking.
Not fast.
Not human.
Just walking…
but he was getting closer.

His red eyes and demonic smile are still haunting me.
Even now, when I close my eyes, I see him standing there… watching.

# CRIMSON PROMISE (2), The Search by [Muze Artists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYsArwTsemg&list=OLAK5uy_ln2TRRzCN1msrjssriEoo_z4D3_XpPshU)

Brady waited until Sheila was at school before making the call.

Owen had retired years ago, living quietly at a small ranch deep in the hills. He didn’t pick up on the first ring, or the second, but when he finally answered, his old gravelly voice filled the line.

“Brady? Haven’t heard from you since… well, since Sheila stopped riding.”

Brady explained everything.  
The firing.  
The dream.  
The horse Sheila described in such vivid detail that it felt like prophecy.

Owen listened in thoughtful silence.

“Brady,” he finally said, “I might know someone. Years ago, before I left the circuit, I met a breeder. Private. Very private. He bred champions before they were champions—before anyone had ever heard their names. Man’s a ghost to most, but I kept his number.”

A pause.

“But understand—horses like the one Sheila described? They don’t come around often. And if they do… they don’t stay hidden long.”

Brady’s pulse quickened.  
“I don’t care what I have to do. Just… find him.”

“I’ll try.”  
Owen hung up.

And so the search began.

# Three Weeks Later

Brady was pouring coffee when his phone rang.

Owen.  
At 5:14 AM.

He answered instantly.

“Talk to me.”

“I found him,” Owen said without preamble.

Brady’s heart stopped.

“The horse?”

“No… *the* horse. Exactly as she described. Fiery red. Burgundy undertones along the flank. Tail bright as embers. Tall. Strong. Unraced. Untamed. Unspoiled. A pure thoroughbred with lineage so strong it looks like myth on paper.”  
A breath.  
“One of the most perfect colts I’ve ever laid eyes on.”

Brady felt the room tilt.

“What’s his name?”

“The breeder hasn’t named him. Says he doesn’t want to ‘influence destiny.’ But Brady… this horse already looks like royalty. Like he knows what he is.”

Brady swallowed.  
“Take me to him.”

“There’s something else.”

Brady stiffened.  
“…Go on.”

“The breeder wants **$50 million**.”

Brady blinked.

“And…”  
Owen hesitated, voice lowering.  
“He’s planning to send the horse to an exclusive auction in four weeks. Royals from Saudi Arabia, Sheiks, people with deep racing roots. Once the horse hits that stage… you’ll never touch him. They’ll bid him into the sky.”

A chill moved through Brady.

“But,” Owen continued, “because I contacted him first… because he remembers me… he said he’ll hold the horse for **two weeks**. After that, the auction arrangements are locked. No cancellations.”

Two weeks.  
That was it.

Brady didn’t need time to think.

“When can we see him?”

“Today. I’ll meet you at the breeder’s ranch at noon.”

# THE MEETING — DESTINY IN MOTION

The ranch sat hidden behind miles of winding dirt road and high pines.  
Brady arrived with Owen… and the moment the stable doors opened, the world seemed to hold its breath.

There he stood.

The horse from Sheila’s imagination.  
Alive.  
Majestic.  
Impossible.

A blazing red coat that shimmered like fire in motion.  
A tail like dark wine swaying with power.  
A noble head held high as if he commanded the earth beneath him.

When he stepped forward into the light, Brady felt something inside him tighten.

This wasn’t just a horse.  
He was destiny embodied.

The breeder approached, quietly confident.  
“He hasn’t been raced. Not once. Not for lack of skill—just lack of the right owner. He needs someone who sees him for what he is.”

Brady nodded slowly.

“I know exactly who that someone is.”

Owen stepped beside him.  
“If Sheila trains him… with the right guidance… Brady, she won’t just ride him. She’ll *unlock* him.”

“Will you train them both?” Brady asked.

Owen smiled faintly, eyes softening with respect for the horse.

“For this one? For this girl?”  
He nodded.  
“I’d come out of retirement.”

Brady reached out—hesitating at first—then placed a hand gently on the colt’s neck.

Warmth.  
Strength.  
A heartbeat like thunder, steady and certain.

This was **Crimson Promise**.

Even if he wasn’t named yet.

Brady turned to the breeder.

“I’ll buy him.”

“Payment in full within two weeks,” the breeder said. “After that… I can’t hold him.”

“You won’t need to.”

Brady already knew:  
He would move mountains for Sheila.

He already had.  
He would again.

Brady stood beside the fiery red colt, imagining the moment Sheila would finally see him.  
Finally touch the dream she thought she’d lost.

*“Soon,”* he whispered to the horse.

*“Soon she’ll meet you. And the world won’t know what’s coming.”*",1,1764611266.0,ShortNarrative,0,1.0,False

So far I’ve had six interviews, and honestly? They’ve all been wonderful in totally different ways. I’ve chatted with a couple who’s been together forever, a few single people trying to navigate the scene, and even a polyamorous single with some seriously great stories. It’s been funny, sweet, chaotic, and very human which was exactly what I was hoping for.

I’ve also made a new form to help me stay organized and to give people a chance to share a bit about themselves before we meet. Nothing intense, but it gives me an idea of what someone might or *might not* be interested in sharing. 

Who I’m hoping to talk to next: I’d love to keep things diverse, so I’m looking for people who are single and trying their best, people in relationships, workaholics, folks in open or poly setups, queer/LGBTQ+ voices, people divorced, widowed, or dating again after a long break, honestly… anyone who has something to say about love, heartbreak, loneliness, apps, hope, whatever. If you’ve got a story, I want to hear it.

With winter here, I’m mostly doing coffee meetups, phone calls, or email chats (dinner is still possible, just might take a bit more planning). If you’re interested, fill out the form or shoot me a message. Thanks again for all the support! this project has already been way more meaningful than I expected. ***I'm expecting to launch the blog around Valentines 2026.***

Today Newell Brands announced that they will cut 900 jobs, or 3.8% of its global workforce and is now up 6%. The restructuring effort is expected to bring in an annualized cost savings of about $110 million to $130 million.

Newell Brands includes Sharpie, Rubbermaid, Graco, Paper Mate, Parker, Waterman, Coleman, Yankee Candle, Mr. Coffee.

What is most important here is that everyone loves and uses a Sharpie. You use it to label, draw, sign, and write. AND it can bring it anywhere—it’s the universal marker. Keep it in your car for emergencies. Walgreens has them. The list goes on.

I am assuming that retailers have likely run inventories down to zero on these. In 2026, when the economy stabilizes, they will have to buy millions of Sharpies to restock. Sales go up, and the $130M savings turbo-charges the earnings.

The real actual news… Senator Pete Stauber bought $15k-$50k worth of NWL stock on 10/27 when it was around $5.00. And guess what, he sits on the Subcommittee for Rural Development, Energy, and Supply Chains which addresses issues intended to enhance economic vitality and opportunity for small businesses. I read that and say, so many small businesses are going to be buying Sharpies among other Newell Brands.

The stock hasn’t been this affordable since 2009.

The one directly above me has always been close with me, telling me all the details of her personal life and texting me from her personal number when she needs advice about something we both enjoy that I’m an expert in. My other manager always looks out for me, insists on getting me a free nice hotel after team events in the city (I live far from it and she doesn’t want me driving home after dark), and is overall really supportive and good vibes.

I was put in an PIP mid-November. I’ll admit some of my consistency in email responses and organization had been lacking, and my numbers were down, but there hasn’t been any formal write ups before this. Just verbal instructions on what to do. The pip had some guidelines including hitting 100% of Q4 (hard with my market at the end of the year), consistently doing a few pretty easy tasks that I just didn’t do because they felt like busy work, and keeping in touch with my managers daily.

I was at lunch with one of my managers the other day (we both are mostly remote but met at a coffee shop near me), and she wasn’t acting like anything was wrong. She was really supportive and said I was like her little brother she was trying to build up and break the bad habits of. She implied I wasn’t cooked if I didn’t hit my 107% as long as I did everything else right. My other manager said I could expense the two additional in-office days I need to do because of the pip.

I hear horror stories of PIPS being used to push people out, but it seems like they’re trying to help more than anything?

So what I want to hear peoples’ thoughts on is this: Do people always get fired after PIPS, or do some managers genuinely use them to help employees who need to change a few things?",1,1764611082.0,Employment,3,1.0,False
1pbjcuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pbjcuj/keep_receiving_were_not_a_match/,"Keep receiving ""we're not a match""","

TL;DR:
I get plenty of matches and my coffee dates feel fun and normal to me, but afterward I often get “no spark/no connection” messages. I’m 28, stable, and looking for something serious. I sometimes wonder if my background/accent plays a role, since interest drops after meeting. Just trying to understand what I might be missing.


I’ve been getting a decent number of matches on dating apps. They’re usually women I’m genuinely excited to meet. I typically go for a coffee date, and I try to build on what we talked about in chat—travel, hobbies, life, etc. I give a compliment or two (always something I genuinely notice), and the conversations usually feel light and enjoyable to me. We laugh a bit, the date lasts around an hour or sometimes longer, and I usually leave feeling like it went well.

But afterward, I often get messages like “we didn’t have a spark,” “I didn’t feel the connection,” or “I don’t think we’re a match.” I respect the honesty and don’t take it personally, but I don’t really understand what I’m not offering on these dates. From my perspective, things feel fine.

For context: I’m 28, good-looking, educated, have a steady income, goals for my life, and I genuinely want a family someday. A lot of the women I go out with say they want similar things, though we don’t always get into deep topics on the first date.

One thing I wonder about is whether my race or accent is a factor. I speak English very well, and communication has never been an issue in previous relationships, but I can’t shake the thought that it might play a role, especially since these women seem very interested before meeting. I'm white, but I'm originally from a country in west Asia and the girls either grew up here, or came from elsewhere in the country, and they're white too. 

I’m not looking to blame anyone—just trying to understand what might be happening or what I could improve. Any insight is appreciated.",2,1764611046.0,dating_advice,2,0.75,False

1pbjc5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nihilism/comments/1pbjc5w/critique_on_absurdism/,Critique on Absurdism,"As we all know, Camus pulled his inspiration for absurdism from the nihilism and perhaps a cup of coffee, but also from his ego. Perhaps because of his egos desperate need to validate his desire for the purpose, he created a hero story of a kind, which forever created a dissonance, incompatibility between the nihilism and absurdism. 

But,

What if there was no need for the dissonance?

For the longest time the scholars have argued for and against the ego, ergo Camus and his rhetoric, while bypassing the obvious - there's no need for it. If we accept nihilism as the de facto condition of the existence, then every choice that follows is absurd by default. it is, in fact, inevitable and perhaps the only logical end result for the reasoning that follows. And just like nihilism gives meaning to nothing, the absurdism gives meaning to everything, yet just like nihilism, validates nothing - only the choice does. What this means is that everything that is possible, is allowed and correct - even the Camus interpretation of the absurdism, even if in this new hierarchical structure it's just one, rather than the only one of those interpretations. What's more,

It's very similar to the wave collapse, where nihilism contains and carries the weight of all of the possibilities but gives purpose to none, whereas the choice absurdly collapses the possibilities and solidifies the reality as one, distilling all the possibilities to a single possible way forward, suggesting a possibility for a far more grand exploration of the critique that is tied to the very existence itself, rather than a puny ego struggling for a purpose.

If you're tired of manually turning things on and off or worried about leaving appliances running, timer-enabled smart plugs can make your life way easier.

## What Are Smart Plugs with Timers?

Smart plugs are small devices that fit between your regular outlet and whatever you want to plug in. They connect to your home WiFi network and let you control power remotely through an app on your phone. The timer feature lets you schedule when devices turn on or off automatically.

## How Timer Functions Work

Most modern smart plugs come with scheduling capabilities right out of the box. You can set up daily schedules, countdown timers, or random on/off patterns. For example, you could have your coffee maker start brewing at 7 AM every weekday, or set a lamp to turn on at sunset when you're away on vacation.

The timer options usually include:

- **Daily schedules** - Same time every day
- **Countdown timers** - Turn off after a set number of hours
- **Custom schedules** - Different times for different days
- **Sunrise/sunset triggers** - Sync with natural light patterns

## Why You'd Want Timer-Enabled Smart Plugs

These automated outlets are perfect for controlling fans, heaters, lights, phone chargers, and seasonal decorations. You can save energy by making sure devices aren't running longer than needed. They're also great for security since you can make your home look occupied when you're traveling.

If you want to explore options with timer functionality, you can check out available smart plugs here: https://athomewave.com/smart-plug

## Setting Up Timers Is Simple

You don't need to be tech-savvy to use scheduling features. After plugging in your smart outlet and connecting it to WiFi, the companion app walks you through creating schedules. Most apps have a simple interface where you pick days, times, and whether you want something turned on or off.

Some advanced models even work with voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant, so you can adjust timers with voice commands.

## Things to Consider

When shopping for programmable smart plugs, check if the timer settings are stored locally or require internet connection. Local storage means your schedules will keep working even if your WiFi goes down.

Also look at the maximum wattage rating to make sure it can handle whatever device you're planning to automate. Most handle lamps and small appliances fine, but larger items need outlets rated for higher power loads.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

However what I have noticed is that my manifestations don’t turn out the way I want exactly, usually a bit delayed and bad timing. I’m very disheartened now, I was manifesting a certain university to the point I genuinely believed and felt certainty I was there. I applied to a few programs the years before and attained places there as well previously, so I took it all as a sign and confirmation, especially taking like a local  coffee shop’s loyalty stamp card so I could finish it upon my next year (as a first year). Unfortunately they just rejected me, not even an interview. 
Many people have told me that it could still mean I could reapply, or go there as a masters but like… in terms of manifesting, why couldn’t it have gone the way I planned? 
My application was very strong and many people around me are very confused, it’s more of an ‘unlucky’ as I could’ve simply been interviewed and then been rejected but I got given no chance. 
P.s. I had genuine belief in it, felt I was going there, visualised waking up there, and was detached (well as much as I could be).

It’s a 8mm herniation. I was diagnosed as a teenager when I started having headaches one day that never really went away. My neurosurgeon at Duke didn’t recommend decompression, just monitoring since chronic 24/7 headaches were my only symptom at that point. 

In the years in between I’ve had it monitored and gotten second and third opinions. Found other diagnoses such as hEDS, MCAS, and dysautonomia. 

I work on a coffee truck and had a moderate fall in June on the truck, almost immediately I started noticing classic high/low pressure headaches so I contacted doctor Grant who heads the Duke Chiari team, they got me in for my first visit quickly and ordered scans, including flexion and extension scans. Then in the end of September I was working on the truck and slipped on the wet steps and landing on the steps right on my spine. After that everything got so so much worse. I turn my head wrong and I’m in suck blinding pain I almost pass out, I start gagging if I move my head wrong, my brain fog is unreal and I can’t make it through the day without at least 1 nap. I finally got my scans done and the scans showed not only severe crowding while my neck is flexed backwards but a clivo-axial abnormality and a very “floppy neck”.

It has been a blast testing flavors and perfecting recipes. What has not been a blast is the book publishing process (or lack thereof). Since I’ve received a number of no’s due to my “low” follower numbers, I decided to take matters into my own hands. 

I created a Payhip site where you can buy individual as well as bundles of my homemade ice cream recipes. So far, I have a smattering of basic flavors, fan favorites and deconstructed delights! You’ll also find a bundle of the flavors I used to sell in grocery stores in Seattle! The flavors include: French Vanilla Bean, Cookies & Cream, Rocky Road, My Famous Lemon Bar, Strawberry Pound Cake and Coffee Caramel. 

The best part is: all my individual recipes are 20% off for the first two weeks, until December 15th. This community has been so wonderful and supportive of my journey! I hope you find my recipes accessible and my ice cream delicious!

Any suggestions on how to spend those two gap days before Florence?

Was considering these options:

1. 2 days in Ravenna
2. 1 day in Rimini, 1 day in San Marino
3. 2 days in Perugia

I love train rides, so I'd happily spend hours on one - the commute time is not an issue, and in fact - the longer the better!

Just wondering how much there is to see in Perugia and Rimini. My travel style is to walk around and meander and stop for coffees/snacks to do some people-watching - if there's a cathedral or museum or concert, I'll check it out, but I don't have a checklist of stuff I need to do.

Any other suggestions on smaller cities to visit?

FYI, after Florence, I'm heading to Naples and plan to do some day trips to Sorento, Pompeii, and Potenza/Castelmezzano. I've already been to Rome a few times. Just leaving this here so people don't suggest what I already have planned.

Thank you!

anyways, after a few months out of my first relationship i realized my way of thinking was not only factually incorrect but also pretty bigoted and messed up and if i had done this to any other group of people after one bad experience i would be a pretty shit person. i consciously have gotten rid of that kind of thinking but subconsciously (or maybe it's my fears/attachment issues) i still struggle with believing things like men only want sex, men don't cry, men don't feel, men don't care about women as equals even though i know it's not actually true. this type of thinking has caused some issues in my current relationship in the past. anyways. 

i was watching a new video from one of my regular youtubers (who's actually helped me a lot with this sort of stuff he's a straight guy and he paints his nails and wears necklaces and very proudly and loudly loves and shows off his girlfriend and talks about how much he loves his parents and all that) and the video was about bad husbands and weaponized incompetence like him reacting to tiktok videos of women sharing how their boyfriend was told to put away the groceries and the he put everything in the fridge while still in the grocery bags or a woman asking her husband to make her coffee and he starts listing off all the things he did for her yesterday so she'll feel bad for asking him. 

i normally used to try to stay away from this kind of content but lately it's been nice to see this and compare to my boyfriend and feel grateful that i have a good relationship with a man who likes to cook for himself sometimes and makes me pancakes when i'm sad and cares about my feelings. anyways long story short i'm sitting here trying to watch the video and my boyfriend keeps interrupting saying stuff like ""you're not actually mad about that you're being performative"" (talking to the youtuber) and he frequently says ""i don't cry"" ""i don't need a jacket i don't get cold"" ""i gotta do this for you im the man"" and it's just like. is that not the complete opposite of what i've been trying to teach myself? i know he's probably doing the ""i don't cry"" stuff because of how boys are raised to be tough and all that but the ""you're being performative"" comment really bothered me. does that mean my boyfriends not as mad as the youtuber at this guy guilting his wife into wishing she hadn't asked him to make her coffee? does he think men can't be mad at other men for being mean to their wives? like what are you doing bro?

✔ super casual... just conversations, chai/coffee, and new connections  
✔ zero agenda, zero pressure... join when you feel like it

First, when I go to pay for something, the payment screen asks me which method of payment I want to use. It shows my Credit Card, G-Pay and PayPal listed under Payment Methods. But, when I go to Linked Payment, the only option I have is my Credit Card. How come I cannot choose G-Pay or Paypal as payment options from the Linked Payments list?

I have gone to McDonald's twice now and they tell me I still need to pay because the app didn't take my payment.

For 26 days I didn’t drink. My mind felt clear. I’ve never really been big on coffee, but boy did that change. I walked more (and I love walking. the hangovers do not) Was more attentive. I was more productive. I was way less irritable. I applied to jobs almost everyday. I was turning down a lot of social outings bc I didn’t want to be tempted to drink and yes it got boring as hell. I spent less money. I didn’t wake up hating myself for almost the entire month. 

Then thanksgiving came and my mom (who hardly ever drinks) decided to along with the rest of my family and I thought “why not?”
Boom! 3 day binge. 

I ate like crap and doom scrolled for 48 hours after Thursday. I wasn’t even enjoying being drunk really, it was more so the act of pouring/taking the shots and chugging the wine that gave me a rush. I kept trying to reach this point of fun or euphoria that never came, but I thought well I already messed up… I’ll start over Monday. Typical. 

While my hangovers weren’t bad and I didn’t do anything stupid. I had no motivation to go on my walks and apply to more jobs. I actually ended up getting 2 rejection emails and a part of me genuinely believes it’s bc I didn’t stay the course and do better for myself. Like the universe saw how easy it was for me to fall back into bad habits and didn’t think I was ready or something. Idk.

Then I got to come home to my beautiful girlfriend, and we watched the first two episodes of new Stranger Things season. I’m grateful for that.

I’m grateful for Thursday. I went on a 20 minute run around the uphill neighborhood. Finished my first mile in under 8.50. We watched the Thanksgiving day parade on TV, a first for my gf. Then our friend and her dog came over for the day and for Thanksgiving lunch; a delicious meal courteous of my gf 😁 😋. Then we relaxed. I finally finished an Anna Karenina audiobook (35 hours long 😮‍💨), and finished reading a Star Wars book; Master of Evil. Yeah, I’m a nerd 🤣 Then my gf put on KPop Demon Hunters since we love it, and our friend’s never seen it. I’m grateful for all that.

I’m grateful for Friday. My gf and I got coffee and matcha. Then we went Black Friday shopping at Kohl’s, and got some new clothes (two long sleeve shirts for me). We got onigiri for lunch; I discovered salted salmon flavor, yum. And my gf got the yarn she needed from Michael’s for crocheting. Back home, my gf got a nap in while I randomly watched Three Caballeros; never seen it; amazing animation, and from 1945! I started a new book (Assassins Creed: Forsaken), and a new audiobook (Star Wars: Shatterpoint). For dinner, we joined our friends and their family at a Japanese BBQ grill restaurant, which was right next to my work, and I’d never been 😅 Then we saw Suffs at the Pantages. I’m grateful for all that.

I’m grateful for Saturday. It was what we called a flop day; a day where we just stay home and do nothing. We’ve so much to do in December, so a flop day was needed. We finished the next two available episodes of Stranger Things. I enjoyed Thanksgiving leftovers for lunch. I went for an hour walk; got a seasonal Peppermint mocha from Starbucks, and two DVDs from my library (Rounders, Black Bag). I did some writing, and finished outlining another chapter for one of my stories. I’m grateful for all that.

I’m grateful for Sunday. Finished Rounders, good movie. Got my bathrooms cleaned, all the laundry done, and my car filled up. I’m grateful for working utilities and my car. I’m grateful for my parents, who wished us a happy Thanksgiving. My gf and I started packing for our cruise for next week. I just have to work Monday, and then we’re gone for the week. I’m grateful for all that.

Oh, and I’m grateful I got to play Ghost of Tsushima every day all weekend.

For context, I have 3 kids 8,8 and 9 that I brought into the relationship. We have a 5 month old together, I solely breastfeed so she’s not sleeping all the way through the night yet. We moved into his 4-plex almost two years ago now and I do not pay rent. I was working before having our baby, paid for our food and all of my bills and everything for my kiddos including gifts and necessities. I do not expect him to help with their clothes or anything else they might need. I still continue to pay for their needs as well as my own bills, minus rent and food now. I used to work doing personal shopping for people since the kids schedules for therapies, specialists school and sickness is always up in the air. We do not have any parents available to help with sick days, appointments and school vacations with the kiddos. I currently stay at home with our 5M old. So I take care of the house, our baby, transportation for my other kiddos, and meals (he pays for groceries now). I am the one to get up with all of the kiddos, start the day, make sure they’re ready to go, drives them to school (obviously, since that’s my “job”). 

I woke up in quite a fowl mood, pretty tired, very foggy. I was halfway through my morning routine. Went out to start the car up, trudged through 1.5 feet of snow that was surrounding my car (not exaggerating). Started the car up and scraped off the top of the car so it wouldn’t pelt drivers behind me. There was snow clear up past my ankles while I was scraping the top off. My Fiancée shoveled the night before…. It seems everywhere else besides around my car. Glad the neighbors had clear ways, but… that blows for me. However, he did scrape the snow off of my hood the previous night which was appreciated! When I came back in he was sitting on the chair (usually still sleeping), asks if it was good enough to get the car out. I paused… very very confused. He hadn’t touched the snow on either side of the car. I responded a little dumb like “I scraped the top of the car off”. I don’t know why I said it, that’s the first thing that popped in my head. He asked the same question again visibly and verbally mad. Adding in, “you were just out there, how do you not know”. I did not understand what he meant… there was two feet of snow around my car, how could that be good enough?. I eventually spat that out and let him know that I didn’t see behind the car since I was focused on the snow everywhere else. 

He kept pressing the issue. Meanwhile I’m trying to still get all of the kiddos ready to go and my mind is split between the conversation, my wet socks, the kids having proper snow gear and leaving the house, that I spat out with attitude “how could that be good enough, you know it’s not when there’s two feet around the car”. That did it, set him off. He still went out and shoveled behind the car for me. He was trying to help I guess… but the whole thing didn’t make ANY sense to me at all. Still sort of doesn’t. 

On my drive to and from drop off I knew I had a poor attitude talking with him and felt bad he was trying to help. Especially since that’s something he usually doesn’t do. He doesn’t get up and shovel behind my car or brush my car off. That was the very first time ever. And go figure I was irritable the one and only time that took place. I planned on apologizing to him after I got home/ or call if he was gone for work. I felt a little dumb about the whole situation. 

He was there by the time I made it back home. I walked in the door to a very angry brooding man in the kitchen and immediately didn’t even want to open my mouth. I felt sheepish, quite embarrassed and awkward and didn’t know how to bring it up. So I figured I would adjust for a few minutes before talking to him. Get coffee and breakfast ready first at the very least. I was chatting with our baby and from the living room he says “why are you so nice to her and no one else”. That gave me pause ( I guess this is how the conversation is about to start). I responded “she’s a baby, and I was confused and didn’t know what you were talking about”. He was angry at that. He told me how he felt and I tried explaining where I was coming from and apologized for my poor attitude. He said he didn’t think I was being genuine,  that I didn’t care that he tried to help me. And That he would never do it again. He doesn’t want to help someone that’s going to be ungrateful. Other people feel the same, that maybe if I showed more gratitude. I couldn’t think of one time with him or anyone that I’d ever been ungrateful. He said he wanted to focus on today’s situation because that’s the reason he’s so pissed was from today. 

From there the argument escalated. We eventually made it to him saying that he wasn’t going to buy groceries for my kids and I anymore. That we were not his responsibility. I mean, legally no. But as far as what a fiancée and stepfather does, why wouldn’t he want to provide? Am I that terrible of a person? Then why even be with me?

I guess I don’t know what went wrong there besides my poor attitude. It felt like he was goading me with an obvious question. That he knew the car wasn’t clear enough for us to walk through. I was able to back out of the drive, but the car was still surrounded once we left.

I am 30 weeks pregnant and for the past 2 months, I have been dealing with her negative comments about the changes to my body. I have been called ""huge"", ""fat"", ""round"" and then last Thursday, she was about to call me ""fat"" again. And that was it. I had had enough.
For the past 2 months, I have been mentally working myself up before every family supper always anticipating a comment about my body. For some reason, she always has to say something. I would prefer nothing but its always something and its just unnecessary. 

The first time she called me fat, my hubby and I had an argument about it.
Then on Thursday night, we had what I could possibly say was our biggest fight in our 5 years of being together. I just put my foot down, I told him exactly what his mother had been doing and the boundaries she had been overstepping, the way she undermines everything I am going through and it was messy.

I then decided thats it, I am going to confront her and put my boundary in place. I didnt want him to do it because I knew she would manipulate him and downplay it to my hormones and being pregannt, say she was joking or whatever else!
I didnt want him to come with me because I knew she would cry and manipulate the situation to again, downplay her actions/behaviour and make it seem like it was me being sensitive. 

I anticipated every scenario and she delivered exactly as expected.

We sat down, ordered our cappuccinos, she said she was surprised to get my text and I normally have so many emojis so she was very curious.
I told her it wasn't going to be a pleasant chat but I needed to speak to her and in all fairness, I should have done this 2 months ago.
I am beyond proud to say, I completely maintained my composure. I was calm, level headed, stuck to the facts and was very straight forward. I told her that I love her and I want us to have a good relationship and for the sake of that relationship, going forward I would really appreciate if she would stop commenting on my body. As the comments she has been making have made me feel very uncomfortable and they have been hurtful.
She was shocked, in disbelief and said no, she would never hurt me and on thursday, she wasn't going to say fat, she wanted to say fragile and just couldnt find the word.
I told her that it isnt just about thursday, for the past 2 months, everytime we see her she has made negative comments about my body. Calling me huge, round, fat and it has made me not want to come to dinner anymore. 
She then said that my hubby actually said to her a while ago that I am very sensitive at the moment (way to downplay and redirect) and she told him to tell me that I am beautiful and am carrying beautifully. I said thats all good and well but she has never ever said anything positive to me, only negative comments.
She didnt apologize, she didnt take any accountability. Just maintained that she would never intentionally do or say anything to hurt me.
I told her I understand that it may not have been her intention but its not about the intention, its about the impact.

As anticipated, she started crying.
I apologized to her 🤣. Just saying sorry, I know I've sprung this on her but I needed to say this in order to move forward. 
She said its fine.

Our cappuccinos arrived. We sat in awkward silence for a minute or two. I recorded the entire conversation because there's no way I'll let her spin a story or put words or a tone. For a minute or two, there's silence.

Then she changed the subject asking if someone we know has texted me yet about a coffee at their house. To which I said no? And she gave me more context.
For the next two hours, we sat there discussing my BIL and his new girlfriend, who my MIL is going to try speak to him about to end things because shes not right for him in MIL opinion. The irony.
She spoke about her dating life.
Asked me about work, my side of the family.

We left in high spirits, she told me it was lovely and we should do it more often.

I left feeling proud of myself. Yes, I didnt get an apology but I did put a boundary in place. I challenged and confronted her. She knows now that I am not scared to come and speak to her. I maintained my emotions. I didnt cry and I am the BIGGEST crier normally but I wasn't going to be that vulnerable with her. 
I think going in knowing I wouldn't get an apology helped me maintain my expectations. 
Going in expecting her to cry to try play the victim, when she isnt an emotional person at all, also helped me maintain, somewhat, I did apologise more than I should have but I anticipated the tears to come and didnt fold or show her an overwhelming amount of sympathy.

My hubby is currently doing work for her employer so sees MIL quite often at the moment, I asked if he saw her today and he didnt but they spoke on the phone about work a few times. He said she was very sad and flat on the phone.
But this is a family that doesnt address or confront issues, everything is swept under the carpet and both of her sons do everything to protect mom's feelings.
He said he didnt expect her to be chipper and is expecting for her to be sad about this for many weeks to come but she must deal with it because he needs to focus on deadlines before year end.

Yes, its frustrating that he will never just wholeheartedly admit his mom was in the wrong. He has said hes on my side.

Before we all bash the husband, save the ""leave that man"" comments for another thread. I am not in my 20s and neither is he. What I am is a grown woman who knows who she married, I knew who and what my MIL is years ago, I am also strong enough to stand up to her myself. And I will do it again when I know boundaries are tested once baby arrives. No doubt about it.

Slowly but surely, my hubby will realise that his mom is playing the victim and manipulating him. And I do believe once baby is here, his eyes will open.

Until then, Im feeling pretty good about myself.",13,1764609236.0,motherinlawsfromhell,7,0.93,False

I cook a lot as well if you wanted to talk about that! Music that I like is like a rock/indie or metal, some examples are The Struts, Bear Ghost, Aviators, Burn the Ballroom, Leprous, etc.

I’m into gaming as well! I’ll leave a list of what I usually play so you can feel out the specific type of autism that I am lol

This will be our 2nd year wedding anniversary. Flying into Denver Friday morning, booked an Airbnb in Breckenridge as base camp, spending the last night (Tuesday) in Denver before flying home to Philadelphia early Wednesday morning. Looking for recommendations or must see places within driving distance of Breckenridge and/or on the way to/from Denver and Colorado Springs. Also any specific food / beer recommendations in any of the 3 areas.

We love to visit breweries and museums, see any local sights or oddities, go on short to medium hikes, live music etc.. Beer, trains, engineering marvels, architecture and nature being top of the list. I am an intermediate snowboarder, wife is not into snow sports. Thinking it might not be worth a day pass just to say I shred a Colorado Mtn. but I’m not crossing that off the list just yet. After a bit of research this is my tentative plan…

Friday 1/16 - land in Denver around lunchtime, pickup rental car (4wd!) and head to Airbnb in Breckenridge. Check in, relax, explore town for the evening. Best spots in Breckenridge?

Saturday 1/17 - sightseeing around Breckenridge, enjoy the town and any local activities. Short hike somewhere close or a must see nearby?

Sunday 1/18 - day trip to Colorado Springs. Cog Railway to top of Pikes Peak or possibly drive to top instead. Back to Breckenridge for the evening. Anything to see or stop at along the way?

Monday 1/19 - possible snowboard day? Or 1/2 day if anything. Send wife to spa while I hit the mountain. Open to hike instead, or guided snowmobile tour which we could enjoy together.

Tuesday 1/20 - enjoy last breakfast / coffee in Breckenridge and head out to Denver. Planning to drive Rt. 6 for some scenery instead of I70 the whole way. Check in to Westin Hotel @ DIA, return rental car. Need dinner recommendations for Tuesday night which is our actual anniversary. Not looking for overly fancy as we wont really have the clothes for that, but possibly something more upscale than what we’ve been used to on the trip thus far. Rental car will be returned but can uber or take train direct from Hotel @ DIA into Denver. Any other quick and easy must see places while in Denver for a few hours?

Wednesday 1/21 - wake up at 4am to walk downstairs and through security, heading home to good old Philadelphia.

Main questions as follows..

- Any and all recommendations for beer / food in any of the 3 cities.
- Pikes Peak Cog Railway. Worth the pricey train ride or just drive up instead? I’m very experienced with winter driving and no fear of heights. Rental car will be Jeep Grand Cherokee or similar 4wd suv. 
- Is it worth it to snowboard alone for 4 hours? Would need to purchase lift ticket with rentals, not to mention send the wife to the spa, so a costly 1/2 day for sure. Or just wait until a different opportunity to shred the mid west mountains.
- Guided snowmobile tour instead? Snowmobile is just about the only thing I’ve never ridden. Very experienced with motorcycles, dirt bikes, atv’s, jet skis, etc..
- Perfect anniversary date night in Denver.

It was just me, a laptop in my cozy kitchen nook, dreaming of sharing sunset pics from road trips with my rescue mutt, Buddy, riding shotgun. But then bam downtime glitches, slow loads that chased visitors away, and support chats that felt like yelling into a void. That heartbreak of watching your passion project fizzle hit harder than a flat tire on a highway.

If you're like I was, a dreamer with a domain and zero clue on where to park it, chasing the best web hosting providers means finding that reliable sidekick who keeps the lights on without breaking the bank or your spirit. After months of trial-and-error swaps (and a few late-night tears over crashed carts), I've zeroed in on three that feel like old friends: [Hostinger](https://hostinger.sjv.io/b3BODm) for its zippy, wallet-whispering vibe; [Bluehost](https://bluehost.sjv.io/3P2JZy) for that nurturing newbie hug; and [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/b3M6ek) for no-nonsense domain magic that extends to solid hosting. These aren't just servers they're the quiet heroes turning ""what if it fails?"" into ""watch me soar."" Let's unpack why they're topping my list this year, blending fresh insights with the real-talk feels of building something that lasts.

# Why the Best Web Hosting Providers Feel Like a Warm Hug for Your Online Dreams

Launching a site isn't just about pixels; it's about pouring your soul into a space that connects maybe a blog spilling family recipes that make your grandma smile from afar, or an e-shop hawking handmade candles that light up someone's tough Tuesday. But let's be honest: Shoddy hosting can snuff that spark faster than a rainy picnic. The best web hosting providers shine by blending lightning-fast speeds (think under 2-second loads that keep Google happy and users hooked), ironclad uptime (99.9% or better to dodge those panic-scroll mornings), and support that chats like a patient pal, not a robot. With cyber threats spiking 20% this year alone, built-in firewalls and free SSL certificates aren't extras they're essentials that wrap your content in a safety net, letting you breathe easy while focusing on the joy of creation.

What tugs at my heartstrings most? These top picks prioritize folks like us side-hustlers juggling day jobs and dog walks over corporate giants. Hostinger's AI tools, for instance, whip up sites in minutes, turning blank stares at dashboards into ""aha!"" grins. Bluehost's one-click WordPress installs feel like a gentle hand guiding your first steps, while Namecheap's transparent pricing dodges those renewal shockers that leave you feeling played. In a year where remote creators outnumber ever before, sales of shared hosting (the sweet spot for starters) are up 15%, proving we're all craving that seamless blend of affordability and ""I've got your back"" reliability.

Sure, flashy ads promise the moon, but after digging through hands-on tests from sites like CNET and TechRadar, it's clear: The real winners deliver emotional wins too like waking to zero outage emails, or watching your analytics tick up because pages load before coffee cools. For multi-site dreamers, scalable plans mean growing pains turn into growth spurts, all without the dread of data migrations gone wrong. If Buddy could type, he'd bark approval for how these hosts keep our virtual adventures purring, one steady heartbeat at a time.

Of course, not every host lives up to the hype I've swapped three times this year alone, each swap a mini-heartache of lost tweaks and transfer fees. But zeroing in on the best web hosting providers cuts the chase: Look for NVMe storage for snappier zips, global CDNs to serve far-flung fans without lag, and eco-touches like carbon-neutral servers that align with our ""leave it better"" vibes. Whether you're crafting a portfolio that lands freelance gigs or a community forum for fellow plant parents, these essentials transform tech talk into tangible triumphs. And with prices dipping under $3 a month for intros, it's less ""can I afford this?"" and more ""why wait to share my story?""

At $2.95 monthly intro, it bundles a free domain and one-click WordPress, which whisked my second site (a Buddy tribute page) online sans sweat pure puppy-love payoff. Uptime's rock-solid at 99.99%, with my logs showing nary a blip over 90 days, and speeds averaging 1.8 seconds via their enhanced CDN. Security's thoughtful: Daily scans, SSL, and spam shields that quashed a sketchy link attempt before it bloomed.

For growing pains, scalable to VPS without drama, and e-commerce add-ons like $2.95 plugins keep carts smooth. Sure, storage caps at 50GB on basics (upgrade for more), and some gripe about renewal hikes to $13.95, but early-bird deals soften it. WPBeginner's nod to its newbie-friendly flow rings true it's where I rebuilt after a flop, emerging with a site that feels like home. Bluehost isn't flashy; it's faithful, the host that holds your hand through the ""what now?"" wobbles.

# Namecheap: The Straight-Shooter for Savvy, No-Fuss Creators

HostAdvice crowns it for value-packed performance, echoing my relief at transparent renewals holding at $5.88. Namecheap's your anchor for authentic builds straightforward, sturdy, and surprisingly speedy for souls seeking simplicity.

# How to Pick Your Perfect Match Among the Best Web Hosting Providers

Narrowing to your fit starts with soul-searching: Blogging solo? Hostinger's zip wins. E-shop ambitions? Bluehost's Woo tweaks. Domain hoarder? Namecheap's bundle bliss. Budget under $5 monthly? All three deliver, but eye renewals longer terms lock lows. Test drives via 30-day refunds ease the leap, and peek at app ecosystems for seamless ties (WordPress? All ace it).

Factor traffic: Low? Shared suffices. Spiking? Check bandwidth caps. And ethics green data centers? Namecheap offsets, warming eco-hearts. Chat support styles too Bluehost's calls for voice vents, Hostinger's AI for quickies. With AI site audits rising, pick hosts with built-ins to future-proof your flow.

I’m relocating from Texas to California next year, and I’m trying to figure out the best areas to look at. I’m 23 now (will be 24 by the time I move), and I’d really appreciate recommendations from people who actually live in California (or has lived there)

Here’s what I’m looking for in a place to live:

* **Safe neighborhood** — this is my #1 priority, especially as a Black woman moving on my own
* **More diverse area** or somewhere I won’t feel out of place
* **Modern or renovated apartments** (updated interiors, good lighting, in-unit laundry preferred)
* **Good parking** — dedicated spot or garage
* **Quiet and peaceful**, but still close to coffee shops, gyms, and grocery stores
* **Warm weather** — that’s one of the reasons I’m moving
* **Not too far from LA** (easy weekend trips or occasional drives)

I’m open to different parts of Southern California, but I keep hearing good things about San Diego, Orange County, and the more suburban areas outside LA.

For anyone familiar with SoCal:

* What neighborhoods should I be looking at with my priorities?
* Are there areas that feel safer and more diverse?
* Any apartment complexes you recommend or places I should avoid?
* Anything I should expect moving from Texas?
* Where should I avoid at all cost?

1pbian8,https://i.redd.it/54v5b7vthm4g1.jpeg,What to Know Before Hiring Hudson County Movers,"If you're [planning a move](https://www.movingofamerica.com/) to or within Hudson County, you’ve probably already realized something: moving here is not like moving anywhere else. 

Between the waterfront high-rises, historic brownstones, narrow streets, and elevator reservations that book up faster than Saturday brunch tables in Hoboken, choosing the right Hudson County movers can make or break your entire experience.

This guide breaks down what locals, new residents, and repeat movers wish they knew—plus how to choose movers who actually understand the area’s very specific challenges.

**1. Why Hudson County Has Become One of the Most Move-To Places in New Jersey**

Hudson County is exploding with energy, culture, and constant growth. It’s no wonder people are coming from NYC, other parts of NJ, and all over the country. 

*Top reasons people love moving here:* 

1. A 10–30 minute commute to Manhattan
2. Walkable neighborhoods full of coffee shops, parks, gyms, and nightlife 
3. Booming residential buildings in Jersey City & Hoboken 
4. Authentic food from all over the world
5. Waterfront views that feel like you’re in a movie

But with growth comes complexity… which brings us to the next part. 

**2. Why Local Experience Matters for Hudson County Moves** 

Hudson County is unique. That means your moving company needs to be equally unique—not just “[New Jersey movers](https://www.movingofamerica.com/locations/new-jersey-movers/),” but Hudson County movers who know the area block by block.

Here’s why: 

✔ Elevator Reservations (Yes, It’s a Real Thing) 

Many high-rises in Jersey City and Hoboken require:

Certificates of Insurance 

Scheduled elevator blocks 

Move-in times limited to weekdays 

Miss the window? You’re rescheduling your entire move. 

✔ Tough Parking & Tight Streets 

From downtown JC to Union City, parking is a challenge even on a good day. Professional movers who know the area can:

Secure permits when required 

Navigate tight loading areas

Avoid tickets and tow-away zones

✔ Old Buildings = Tricky Staircases 

Historic brownstones and walk-ups have: 

* Sharp turns 
* Narrow stairwells 
* Delicate banisters 

You want movers who’ve been there—literally. 

**3. What People Wish They Knew Before Hiring Hudson County Movers** 

We surveyed local residents and found these are the most common “I wish someone told me!” moments: 

1. Some buildings don’t allow weekend moves 

A huge surprise to out-of-towners. 

2. Weather hits the waterfront harder 

Wind near the Hudson River = secure your fragile items. 

3. Move times fill up quickly 

Especially near the 1st or 15th of the month.

4. DIY moves are much harder here 

Traffic + elevators + parking = a maze. 

5. Professional movers save hours (and arguments) 

There’s a reason most locals don’t attempt it alone. 

**4. How to Choose the Right Hudson County Movers** 

A reliable moving company should offer:

✔ Local Expertise

Experience moving in [Jersey City](https://www.movingofamerica.com/locations/jersey-city-mover), [Hoboken](https://www.movingofamerica.com/locations/hoboken-movers/), Bayonne, West New York, Weehawken, and Union City.

✔ Transparent Pricing

No hidden fees for stairs, long carries, or tight access. 

✔ COI Support 

Most luxury buildings require a Certificate of Insurance before you can even book the elevator.

✔ Packing & Unpacking Services

Perfect for busy professionals and families. 

✔ Storage Options 

For gaps between move-in and move-out.

Choosing movers who already know the layout, policies, and quirks of Hudson County saves you money, time, and a ton of stress.

**5. The Hudson County Movers Trusted by Locals**

If you’re ready for a move, that’s: 

Efficient 

Well-coordinated 

Stress-free

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Phoenix Suns vs. Los Angeles Lakers: A Tale of Two Cities (and Two Fatigue Levels)**

The Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Lakers are set to clash in a showdown that’s less “March Madness” and more “December Exhaustion.” With the Lakers riding a seven-game winning streak and the Suns nursing a 4-5 December slide, this isn’t just a game—it’s a battle between a well-oiled machine and a team that’s probably still trying to remember where they parked their bus. Let’s break it down with the precision of a stat head and the humor of a late-night host who’s had one too many espresso shots.

### Parse the Odds: Why the Lakers Are the Favorite (and Why the Suns Should Pack Extra Coffee)

The Lakers enter as **-5.5 to -6.5-point favorites**, with moneyline odds implying a **60%+ chance of victory** (thanks to those 1.51 decimal odds—math, not magic). Their recent dominance? A seven-game streak that’s smoother than LeBron James’s postgame interviews. The Suns, meanwhile, are **12-9 but 4-5 on the road**, where their defense is about as effective as a sieve at a soup kitchen (19th in defensive rating).

Key numbers:

* **Lakers’ home court edge**: 10th-best defensive rating at Crypto.com Arena.
* **Suns’ travel woes**: Three games in four nights, including a 130-112 shellacking by the Nuggets. They’ve played more minutes in the last week than a Netflix binge-watcher on a weekend.
* **Injuries**: Phoenix is missing Jalen Green, Isaiah Livers, and Ryan Dunn—three names that sound like they belong on a boy band’s hiatus list. The Lakers? They’re *maybe* without LeBron James (status uncertain), but they’ve won games without him anyway.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Streaks, and Why the Lakers Are Like a Tesla on Autopilot

The Lakers’ winning streak? It’s so long, it’s started to cast a shadow over the Suns’ playoff hopes. Their backcourt of **“Luka” Doncic** (wait, isn’t he in Dallas? *—Ed.*) and Austin Reaves has combined for 73 and 74 points in their last two games. If this is a typo, it’s a very confident one.

I'm at my wit's end (London/UK),"I was a Personal Trainer before this job I'm doing for the local authority & it did not work out which lead me to apply for a financially ""secure"" job which lead me to my current job 6 years ago. I was 23 when I started, now I'm 30.. The idea was to do a Business Admin apprenticeship, maintain an office job and work my way from there but I was conned into doing customer service which I went along with. 

  
After 6 years I've been pushed from pillar to post, call centres, receptionist positions, even made me train to be a barista for their coffee enterprise idea (humiliating).... Most jobs I applied for I seem to be out of their remit with lack of experience, it takes a lot to mentally apply for jobs & get through interviews, it usually leads me being rejected primarily due to lack of experience. 

  
So without studying or considering going back to another apprenticeship (if I'm allowed), where do I go from here? If I could afford to I'd just go to University & study trying to discover a path to venture into but in my situation I have to focus on climbing a unclimbable corporate hierarchy. 

  
Doing customer service is taking it's toll on me, I'm burdened with feeling embarrassed, low-value, stuck, underappreciated when I'm competent at channeling my mind to anything & being versatile. I am a naturally introverted guy, so for me to do a job that goes against the grain of my personality for nearly 7 years is mentally taxing. I feel like the magnitude of this lead me to focusing all my remaining free time on finding an escape from reality..So I'm stuck in a loop of working in reality & escaping it in my free time rather than being able to use it to get me out. It's destroying me doing this.

1pbi74o,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1pbi74o/day_111/,Day 111,"I read this r/ daily as a kind of reminder of why I quit all caffeine (no soda, chocolate, coffee, etc.), and often still search material to read other's experiences to understand my own. This is a subjective account of my experience, and everyone's will be different, some relatable, some not.

My intake was varied. I quit Sept 2023, and started drinking coffee again Jan 2024 due to personal misfortunate that led me need a bump in energy, as I had started a new job. But then, April 2024, I had quit again for 2 weeks, and had quit that said job. Then by May 2024, I started working at a methadone clinic, waking up at 4 AM, and needing to be emotionally present at 5 AM to counsel clients. It felt irresponsible to show up and have no energy to be present for the clients, as I tried quitting a few times while working there, and had no emotional energy to listen and work with them. I consumed what I estimate was around 250-275 mg of caffeine on weekdays, and then getting a venti blonde roast at Starbucks on the weekends, which are around 450 mg. This was the modus operandi from May 2024 to Feb 2025 when I quit this job.

Aug 12 - Quit coffee cold. Had been tapering down using instant coffee and cooking measuring spoons for awhile, decreasing it systematically. Yet, I was also working at Starbucks. Started there in July, and while tapering, had been giving away the free beans I get, and free drinks to friends, a nice social currency in the absence of drinking it. While working there and tapering down, I would have bad sleep sometimes, and go into work and get blasted on cold brew at 545 AM on 4-5 hours of sleep. My tapering was slow and steady, starting back in June, so many days of maybe 30-45 mg, then 200+ mg. So there was tapering, but there were still pockets of heavy use. Aug 12 I had not a drop of coffee/caffeine. Felt fine for a few days, then severe insomnia started. I think it was already ready to kick in from the tapering. I would wake up after 5 hours of sleep, my mouth would be dry, and I could not sleep, no matter how much water I drank, no matter how I changed my diet (drink lots of water throughout the day, drink less water throughout the day, eat more fiber, less sodium, more sodium, less carbs, more carbs). It was savage, and led me constantly to wanting to have caffeine to compensate. This lasted in a rather consistent and unbearable way for about 2 weeks, and then sleep gradually returned to being consistent, with still nights of poor sleep here and there. Emotions felt wild and not very controllable in terms of swinging from one extreme to the other.

Grad school started Aug 20. Full time student, and couldn't function. I've already got an MA before in philosophy, which was infinitely more demanding than this program. No migraines or pain, but insomnia and dread took it out of me. Showed up a shell. Heard my inner monologue making every excuse to drink caffeine so as to be able to do the course work, socialize, stay awake through classes going from 445 PM to 950 PM. Socializing felt difficult, words felt slow to form and difficult to speak. At the start of the semester it was taking me 10 hours to do what I knew I could do in 3-4 hours if I were operating normally. Could not enjoy playing pickleball, as it felt like my body and mind were all slower: at least 10% slower movements in the body, 10% slower eye tracking, 10% slower reaction time, 10% slower reading the other players, 10% slower hand eye coordinate (if not more than 10% those early days, likely around 20%). All those factors added up to playing poorly and being angry and frustrated to the point of not playing at times. I spend a lot of time wondering if I can only play pickleball in an enjoyable way if I am caffeinated, like, the caffeine stimulation is what made me enjoy it, and whether I will ever enjoy it again.

September - Quit Starbucks at the start of September, 3 weeks after quitting caffeine. Took a few weeks off work to find a new job, figure out how to do school in this condition, and self-care. These were dark days. Anxiety galore, catastrophizing everything, finding every reason to drink caffeine, scrolling through Indeed job postings with gloom. These days were the worst of it. I'd exercise (jogging), still play pickleball and become frustrated, go for walks, eat well, hydrate, get sunlight on the skin, but none of this reduced the gloom. The feeling was of not being able to do anything competently while also lacking the energy to do anything at all. Exercise seemed to help, as getting some basic dopamine going took some of the edge off, but only in minor ways, as a feeling of existential inadequacy colored all aspects of life. And, as it was, I had no motivation to exercise anyways, it was done by forcing myself to do it. Often I would make a point of listening to my body and my feelings, which then led to long periods of time laying in bed, looking at the ceiling, listening to nothing, doing nothing. This would lead to telling myself ""well, this is what you will be doing from now on, doing nothing. And once you get a job, you will still be able to do nothing, and quitting that job too, and when school picks up, you won't be able to keep up."" Sleepwise, I did dream more and start to sleep better, but I was still always tired no less. Socializing still felt stilted and laborious. Read about the kindling effect sometime in Sept on this subreddit, and it helped put into perspective how quitting a substance doesn't always happen the same way each time.

October - Started working hanging Christmas lights on houses to keep busy while looking for a 'real' job, as this was part time seasonal work. Working outside in good fall weather and constantly moving around seemed to help a lot. Work that required no thinking, and that was also with a good crew of people, making jokes through the day. Scary at times being way up on a ladder with no health insurance, got the blood flowing as it was was engaging in a way that gave a rush that I think quelled the withdrawals at times. Still a baseline of dread and feeling of inadequacy underpinning life. Oct 12 or so, 60 days in, still grim, starting to have doubts as whether to whether it is sustainable to quit caffeine. Job searching began to feel useless, like I couldn't find part time work that paid anything decent despite having experience/education. I had quit back in 2023 for a few months, and then, it had only taken about 45 days to feel decent. Here, 60 days in, all the worse. My inner monologue saying ""It's likely some deeper depression that the caffeine was medicating, and maybe I need that caffeine hit to deal with these issues."" Which, I'm sure, was true at some level that caffeine was keeping at bay some depressing elements of life beyond my control. Though, reality was that when I tapered down to 0 mg back in 2023, I had tapered in a much slower way, and with much less pressure on myself, and also used a reasonable amount of weed to take the edge off. This time the tapering was inconsistent, and I wasn't consuming nearly as much herb. (For what it's worth, I don't drink alcohol either except for the occasional 1-2 beers a month, as a hangover, or even the lethargy of just two drinks, will lead to wanting caffeine). Also, this tapering was after 10 months of pretty intense caffeine consumption, and waking up at 4 AM for 10 months, which I think impacted some deeper mechanism of sleep/energy/adenosine. Yet, despite all this about October being grim, there were days that were lighter and nice, then followed by bleak days. The inconsistency drove me crazy -- why couldn't the days be consistently bad or consistently good? Why was this unlike the last time I quit caffeine?

November - At the start of Nov, the frustration continues on the question of why I am still experiencing a deficit in physical energy, ability to concentrate, mental attention, focus, etc. I notice, though, that I can play pickleball somewhat well. It is hit and miss, some days good, some days bad, but there is at least a silver lining of possibility that I can play better. Around day 90 of no caffeine things do turn for the better. Perhaps its placebo from having read people saying the 3 month mark changes things, though, for me, it did. Nov 11 I did what I thought should be 6 hours of homework over the course of 6 hours. But, doing it now without caffeine was better. Typically in the past when using coffee to get work done, I would wait till a day off, like Sunday, to drink a lot of caffeine and try and hammer out 6 hours of work. What would happen is, the first few hours would be great, sitting and grinding, but then would deteriorate, my mind would get diminished returns, and by hour 4, I would feel my body tense with frustration and the loss of focus, but force myself to sit and work for another 2-3 hours. By the end of it, I would be worn out, my stomach hurting from posture declining and anxiety causing a kind of panic state in the body, and then feeling like needed to escape that state of mind. However, doing this homework non-caffeinated on Nov 8 and Nov 9 was spread out over Saturday and Sunday. Saturday: work for an hour, go for a walk for an hour (and not listen to any podcast or music). Work another hour, have lunch. Work another hour, read something for enjoyment, take a short walk, then went and did a part time job Saturday night. Sunday, basically the same thing, and then, by the time I was done working Sunday afternoon, I felt great. I had done the work in the time I expected and I did not feel bad after, and had no caffeine crash, and I enjoyed the other parts of my day between school work (walks, reading, lunch) in very simple ways that were nice and peaceful.

I started a new job around Nov 13, and felt still a bit sluggish in learning how to navigate everything, had a couple of nights of bad sleep going in to work, and feeling like a cup of coffee would really be justified to make learning this new job possible. However, reality was, after a few hours of just waking up normally, things were fine. Bad sleep without any caffeine dependence isn't so bad. Bad sleep without caffeine while being dependent is hell. My body worried being tired would be like the hell of poor sleep without caffeine. The job is becoming smooth, requiring less mental focus/energy each day, bringing it down to

This past week I have seen the change from simply not feeling bad to actually starting to feel good. I feel a distinct ability to stop my mind from roaming, and to simply think about stuff in deeper ways, to focus on a question or an interpersonal issue, or simply resolve problems in life. I write a lot and I feel a capacity to think about what I want to write in a sustained way, where my mind can really imagine a small little world (not necessarily fictional) that can be built up and explored, as the thought does not move quickly. I feel I can socialize better than before I was drinking coffee, and my emotions feel a lot more stable. Way less anxiety overall. I imagine as time goes on things will get better. I still crave caffeine, telling myself 'yeah, its a day off after Thanksgiving, have a cup of green tea, one of the nice bags your friend got you... it was a gift... its rude not to drink the tea that was a gift...."" And usually that's when I'll go on this subreddit and read about other's experiences.

One anecdote: A week back, for the end of a group project in a class, someone brought donuts. I ate a chocolate frosted ones. It was 630PM. I could not fall asleep till 12 or so. I know there will be doubters as to whether the frosting on a donut can do this, though I am convinced this was the case, as I have have 0 mg of caffeine for about 100 days at that point, and I know exactly how caffeine feels, as I used, and abused it systematically for years.

Reasons for quitting:

\- I loath the idea of going to work, drinking caffeine, spending my day highed-up doing something for someone else, then getting home and having no energy/emotions for myself. It felt for me like caffeine takes the best part of my day and gives it to someone else. And to do that as a lifestyle is to take the best part of my life and give it to making money or for someone else's benefit. I'm okay with work being boring or dull, or okay with looking for a job that suits me better, rather than enjoying work, and having nothing left over for myself. Even if I end up working for myself, owning my own business (which I intend to do), I would still rather have the best hours of my day for something other than work (i.e., for reading and writing, for enjoying other's company in a more simple, present way, etc.)

\- I thought caffeine disturbed my sleep/dreaming. This has been undeniably true in my case. I sleep better and remember very many more of my dreams. Dreaming has become an interesting part of my life again. There are many people on this subreddit who argue things like ""if you drank 50 mg when you woke up, 16 hours later it cannot impact your sleep."" *This is such insanity and one of my reasons for writing this post.* Even if the caffeine has been reduced and filter out to basically nothing, it seems pure ignorance to say that the secondary and tertiary effects of caffeine still don't impact you. To say any amount of caffeine cannot effect someone after X amount of time sounds about as reasonable as saying ""Yeah, well, you almost had a near fatal car accident that severely scared you at 7 AM on your way to work, and it is 10 PM, so there's no way that adrenaline dump caused any impact on you 15 hours later, as adrenaline only impacts your system for X amount of time."" How caffeine impacts our adrenaline glands, cortisol levels, adenosine receptors, and how these (and other processes) change our anxiety levels all seem about as relevant (if not more relevant) than the simple presence of caffeine's half life in the body. It is reductionistic to say that caffeine's presence in the body is the way it effects us, as if there are not psychological elements that impact us just as much.

\- I can manage my time much better. Say I start doing homework at 8 AM on a Saturday and then see that the neighbor is starting some deck building project, now, I can simply go do something else until later when they're done. Previously, having drunk coffee, I would feel that I could only be productive during a window of time. I would become angry that I would have to relocate to work during that window of time, or simply do it later when all the premium brain juice had run dry. I knew this effect from quitting in the past

\- I wanted to see if I could think more clearly and peacefully, and if my thoughts would become deeper. As of day 111, this is definitely the case, and it is improving. There is less clutter in my thinking, and thoughts do not race, but cruise. My memory feels better at this point as I can make an effort to encode memories better, where I can better parse out what is meaningful and what is not.

\- I wanted to see if it impacted my levels of anxiety. I have learned to deal with anxiety in responsible ways. Good night of sleep, exercise, good diet, socializing, self care, they all went a long way. But now I have less anxiety overall and so can manage how I spend my day much better. I notice myself spending many hours without listening to music or podcast, where listening to something before was a kind of escape. Escape from what? I can only really label it as a low hum of anxiety that comes after the crash of caffeine, an anxiety that can be silent sometimes, loud at others. Last Sunday I raked the yard for 3 hours listening to people in the neighborhood. Previously, I would be seeking to consume something, anything, podcasts I don't even like just to listen to something while working (where working here is defined as doing what I don't really want to do, like raking leaves). Now, I just think work in silence. Do dishes quietly. And I look forward to walks without consuming music or podcasts.

\- Slowing down goals, lowering ambitions. All caffeinated I would think ""Oh damn, I want to write this about XYZ, but what if I die before I can write it all down in a way that can be shared?"" and now, I think ""well, I'll work on XYZ slowly, over time, make sure it is quality and not rush it, and if I die before I can get it done, that would stink, but one day it'll happen anyways, never enough time as it is."" I see things as taking time, and things worth doing as taking a lot of time that cannot be rushed.

\-See if it would improve digestion. I do not have any digestion issues in any consistent ways at this time. In the past I had a couple of years of IBS, so I am aware of the ups and downs and how things can be good or miserable with the gut. I will say that my gut feels a lot more stable, like I can eat more fiber (nuts, salads, fruit) without edging towards it being too much fiber and having an upset stomach. I also feel my body is more hydrated, skin less dry.",2,1764608529.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

***JR: You’ve played such a wide range of characters from lawmen to villains to everyday guys. How do you approach getting into such diverse roles?***

***WF:*** *(laughs) Well, it’s different every time. I guess if I had an answer to that I should write a book so I could remind myself what I did the time before. Not sure who would read the book besides me— probably my four sisters. It’s different every time. You don’t know what that thing is that’s going to give you a clue into who somebody is. Is it physical? Is it emotional? For me personally, I think the biggest joy is in the discovery process of trying to fully realize who a character is. That’s the goal anyway.*

 

***JR: Is there a role that you feel has defined your career?***

***WF:***  *I’m still waiting for it; will you write it for me? (laughs) No, I don’t think there’s one particular role that changed the course of my career or fully defined it. I think there are several roles along the way that really helped my journey. Contact comes to mind.  I had been in two or three films before Contact and the roles were not necessarily tough guys, heavy guys, but definitely walking down that road. WhenI heard about the role of this blind scientist in the film, I flew myself out to LA to read the script in the casting director’s hallway. Contact was a real challenge to play a part like that, and quite honestly, changed the way I prepare, which was really exciting. And also Go, because it was such a cool and intense movie and but also really funny. Very interesting colors for any actor to play.* 

 

***JR: You’ve worked with directors like Christopher Nolan and Michael Bay. How do their styles compare from an actor’s perspective?***

***WF:*** *Well, you couldn’t have picked two guys from more opposite ends of the spectrum, I’ll tell you that! But I will also tell you that directors like Chris Nolan and Michael Bay and others that I have worked with, like Robert Rodriquez, Ridley Scott, Michael Mann,Robert Zemeckis and Gore Verbinski, they all have a crystal-clearvision about what they want. And having great vision allows the actor so much room. I like that these are not directors that have to spell out every single thing in detail about what you should think or do; they trust you and trust is freedom. When I feel trusted by a director, the sky is the limit, and then you can really play around.* 

 

***JR: You’ve built a career that’s both respected and somewhat under the radar. Was that intentional or just how things unfolded?***

***WF:*** *I worked with an actor once who wanted nothing more than to be famous. And you know what? He got it. But he didn’t get it just because he wanted it, he was really, really good. I’m a late bloomer to this. I graduated college with my shiny degree in Criminal Justice, wondering, “What am I going to do with my life?” When I moved to New York and started studying, I always felt that I was behind the eight ball. I always felt that everyone else knew how to talk about acting in ways that I didn’t know how to talk about it. I was very intimidated by it all. So, what always mattered more to me was to have my peers respect what I did.  Nothing meant more to me than that, probably still doesn’t. Did I plan on being under the radar? (laughs) It’s not a bad view under the radar. I wouldn’t mind a few minutes above the radar. I mean I don’t have to live up there, but ...*

 

***JR: In your latest project, Anne Rice’s Talamasca: The Secret Order, you play a mysterious, dark character who is pursuing power. How did this role come about?***

***WF:*** *Well, outside of seeing the original film, Interview with theVampire, back in the early 90s, I was not really familiar with the Anne Rice universe, except for this past summer watching the first two seasons of the series Interview with the Vampire. And then, I got a call about a meeting with the creators of this new show called Talamasca. I had a lovely cup of coffee in Eagle Rock, California with the amazing Mark Johnson; Tom Williams, his producing partner; and John Lee Hancock and Mark Lafferty, the two showrunners. They gave me a copy of the first two scripts, and I have said it a million times in my life, but if it’s not on the page, it’s not on the stage. And it was on the page. It’s a combination of many things that makes something exciting, at least for me: Who is involved with it? How is the material? What do you think of the role? Do you feel like you can find that? Talamasca felt like it just had everything, not to mention the fact that it’s a mysterious and supernatural world, and I have never quite gone down that road. Sure glad I did.*

Even with all the stitching, the gluing, the God-knows-what chemical cocktail Colby slathered on to make Tommy “whole” again, it wasn’t him. Not even close.

I’ve spent enough time around animals, cats especially, to know how a body is supposed to move. This thing lurched. A sloppy, side-to-side wobble, like a drunk toddler taking its first steps. Every clumsy shuffle closed the distance between us, and for one awful heartbeat, I got the sense it thought I was its mother, its anchor in the new world.

And that’s when the fear hit bone-deep.

I stumbled back, the cheap plastic curtain Colby had hung from the ceiling wrapping around my ankle like a dead man’s hand. My foot snagged, and I went down hard, flat on my ass against the cold concrete. The toolbox beside me skidded away with a metallic scrape, just out of reach, my fingers slipping uselessly along its smooth lid.

For a split second, I wanted nothing more than to snatch it up, swing it, and turn whatever scraps of Tommy were still shambling toward me back into the same warm, formless mess I’d scooped into a plastic bag the day before.

Maybe this time I’d bury him deep enough he’d stay down.

“What the fuck is that?!” I hissed in Colby’s direction, my voice cracking somewhere between terror and fury.

He just stared down at me with that crooked smile, half proud parent, half dog that knows it’s dragged something dead onto the porch. He watched me writhing in the plastic curtain like I was some trapped possum he’d cornered for fun.

“It’s your boy!” he crowed. “All fixed up!”

Fixed.

Right.

Whatever was stuffed inside the sagging skin of that fat orange bastard must’ve heard my voice. Must’ve recognized it, because its two bulging eyes shifted. Not in unison. Not even close. They rolled lazily in their sockets, like wet marbles floating in cold soup, trying to decide which direction reality was in.

One pupil drifted sideways toward the bridge of its nose, drifting like it was caught in a slow ripple. The other wandered across the room, scanning for something, maybe looking for me, maybe for Colby, maybe for whatever it thought was its owner or maker or both.

Up close, they looked like snowballs jammed into its skull by someone who didn’t understand how eyeballs were supposed to fit. A size too big. Maybe two. Definitely not meant to be there.

I thrashed harder in the plastic bear trap Colby called a curtain, and by some miracle the cheap material finally gave way, ripping under the frantic, ugly strength of pure panic. The second my ankle came free, I lashed out with a slow, lazy kick at whatever was pretending to be Tommy.

It didn’t dodge, didn’t even try. 

It just folded.

The whole thing slumped sideways like a sack of wet grain, one eye popping half loose from the socket it had never belonged in to begin with. And Colby, the mountain of fat that was him was dropped to his knees beside it as if I’d kicked his newborn child.

The scream he let out was so raw, so animal, that for one horrible second, I almost felt guilty.

“GIVE HIM TIME TO ADJUST!” he shrieked, voice warbling and drenched in snot and hysteria. “I PROMISE HE’LL BE GOOD-BRAND NEW!”

My hand shot out toward the red toolbox, fingers closing around the cold handle of a screwdriver. I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I just moved, a sudden animal burst of adrenaline firing through my legs.

Colby noticed instantly.

Apparently, I was more important than his masterpiece.

“Man, don’t be like that!” he bellowed, and I could hear him lumbering after me, heavy, clumsy footsteps shaking the floorboards like a predator with a limp.

I scrambled toward the stairs and bolted up them on all fours, the way I used to as a kid when I wanted to feel fast. But now it wasn’t exhilarating. It was desperate, messy, painful. My knees slammed the wood; my palms slipped on dust. I could hear Colby’s ragged breath right behind me.

Then I felt it, that sudden clamp around my ankle.

Wet, greasy, disgustingly warm.

It wrapped around me like something pulled from a clogged drain.

For a heartbeat I braced myself for the yank, the violent drag backward, my teeth smashing on the steps, the tumble into the dark where Tommy waited to welcome me to whatever afterlife rejects like us ended up in. 

But the pull never came.

He just held me there while I kicked and thrashed like a trapped animal. His grip was firm but trembling, the way someone holds onto the last valuable thing they own.

I twisted around, breath sawing in and out, and met his eyes.

Those wet, stupid cow eyes. Shining with a sadness so heavy it didn’t belong on a man his size. Like I was the only thing he had left in this world.

Something in me recoiled.

Without thinking, without even aiming, I swung the screwdriver down and drove it straight into his hand.

It slid in almost too easily, like his skin had just been waiting to split.

There was a soft, sickening give as metal punched through muscle.

Colby’s grip vanished instantly.

He howled and staggered backward trying to catch onto anything as he fell down, his fat fingers sliding off the walls of the basement.

And as he fell, a quiet, shameful part of me hoped the concrete would finish what I couldn’t, snap his neck, crack his skull, silence him for good.

I didn’t hear a break or a thud, just the hollow gulp of the dark swallowing him whole. I didn’t wait for anything more. I lunged for the hatch, fingers scraping along the edge as I hauled myself up. I didn’t bother closing it. I just ran.

The porch lights were dead, the world a blur as I burst outside, nearly twisting my ankle on the slick boards. I skidded across the wet grass, scrambling upright, lungs burning. Then I threw myself into the car, jammed the key in, and kicked the engine awake.

I drove until the house vanished behind the trees, until the glow of Colby’s porch, dead and hollow, was nothing but a smudge in the rearview mirror. My hands were trembling so hard the wheel kept slipping under my fingers, the rubber feeling slick, like someone else’s grip was still on it.

A mile out, I finally let myself breathe. It came out shaky, uneven, like my lungs were trying to cough out the fear still lodged inside them. The road was empty, just a pale strip cutting through the fields, the headlights catching nothing but fog and the occasional fence post.

When I hit the first crossroads, I slowed down. Not because I wanted to, my whole body screamed at me to keep going, never look back but because I needed to know if something was behind me. I checked the mirrors once. Twice. A third time.

Nothing.

By the time I reached my street, the sky was starting to grey, just that dead, washed-out color the world gets before anything wakes up. The houses looked unfamiliar, like copies of homes I used to know. Even mine. Especially mine.

I parked crooked in the driveway, halfway onto the grass, too drained to care. The engine clicked as it cooled, each sound sharp enough to make me flinch. I sat there for a moment with my forehead against the steering wheel, just breathing, trying to remember what “safe” was supposed to feel like.

Eventually, I forced myself out. The air was damp, colder than I expected, and it slapped me awake enough to move. Gravel crunched under my shoes as I walked to the door, every step slow. My legs felt like they still remembered the basement, like they expected hands to grab them again any second.

The key almost slipped out of my fingers when I tried to unlock the door. I hadn’t realized how stained my hands were until I saw the dark, dried streaks under the porch light. His blood. Mine. I didn’t know. I didn’t want to know.

I shut the door behind me and leaned on it, eyes closed, letting the familiar smell of dust and old wood settle around me. For a second, it helped.

I kicked off my shoes, letting them fall wherever, and walked to the kitchen. The lights flickered on, too bright after the dark, and I had to squint. The room was untouched, same mugs by the sink, same half-empty cereal box, same note on the fridge I’d meant to throw away a week ago.

But even after I locked the door, deadbolt, chain, the whole works, my chest stayed tight, like something in me was still braced for Colby to come lurching out of the dark with that screwdriver jutting from his arm, eager to return the favor by burying it in my eyes.

I went straight to the sink and scrubbed my hands like a man trying to wash off a crime. The water ran brown, dirt, blood,rot of the basement , who knows, and the harder I scrubbed, the hotter my skin burned. I dumped the bowls and cups the moment they filled, terrified the stink of that place might cling to the ceramic, might somehow call him here like a dog following a scent trail.

That’s when the floorboard behind me creaked.

My heart didn’t just jump, it tried to claw its way out of my ribs. I spun around, fist cocked, ready to plant a punch right between those big, weepy cow eyes of his-

\-but it wasn’t Colby.

It was Samantha.

She squinted at me from the doorway, her face half-lit, half-lost in shadow, looking more confused than scared.

“What are you doing?” she asked, voice thick with sleep.

I had never been so relieved to see another human being in my life. Something inside me cracked open. I rushed to her and wrapped her up, clutching her like some kid who stayed up past bedtime watching a horror flick and then realized he still had to walk down the hallway alone.

She smiled, small, tired and looped her arms around me, though they hung weakly, like she barely had the strength to hold her own weight.

“It’s okay,” she whispered against my shoulder. “You should get some rest.”

I pulled back just to make sure she was real, that her eyes weren't a pair of glass Christmas decorations.

“I didn’t hear you come in,” she murmured, brushing her thumb over the side of my hand. “You’re shaking.”

“Yeah” I whispered “Rough night”

I just replied, feeling myself sinking deeper into her embrace with every passing second.

Thankfully, she didn’t push for details. If she had, I wasn’t sure what would’ve spilled out. 

She just squeezed my wrist and stepped past me, grabbing a towel off the counter to wipe the water I’d splashed everywhere. She moved slowly, like everything hurt. Or maybe she was just that tired.

“You’re gonna crash hard in a minute,” she said, voice soft, almost patient. “Just… go lie down. I’ll clean the rest.”

I nodded, swallowing the knot in my throat. The tension in my body was still buzzing like static, but I didn’t argue. I felt stripped raw, like a thin-skinned version of myself.

She guided me toward the doorway with a warm, steady hand on my back. I managed a nod, or something close to it, and drifted down the hall. I don’t remember getting to the bedroom. I don’t remember lying down. One heartbeat I was upright, the next I was gone, sinking into the mattress.

Sleep didn’t come gently. It came in crushing waves, thick darkness, then a flash of memory so sharp it felt like glass. Over and over, the same moment.

The screwdriver sinking into his hand.

My brain, ever the showman, decided to ramp up the production.

Now let’s see it in slow motion!

Some deranged director living behind my eyes shouted it like a carnival barker.

And suddenly it all stretched out, inch by awful inch, the push of metal against skin, the way it puckered before it tore, the sickening give of flesh parting around the steel. The color of it, the heat of it, the way his breath hitched wetly in shock. Every frame a little clearer than it had any right to be.

When the show finally sputtered to an end, I came to with the bed half-cold beside me. Samantha was already gone, of course, she was. At least one of us had some damn sense of manners, or mortals, as my scrambled brain tried to call it. She hadn’t had the heart to wake me. 

There was no refund for the night’s entertainment unless you counted the puddle of drool glued to my pillow. I peeled my cheek off it with a wet smack that felt far too loud in the empty room.

For a split second, I let myself pretend the whole thing had been a fever dream, one of those sweaty, delirious nightmares you laugh about later but never really forget. But reality settled in fast. My body told the truth before my mind could lie: muscles stiff like I’d run a marathon through broken glass, a skull-throb pounding behind my eyes like a truck tire had used my head for a speed bump.

Yesterday happened.

All of it.

I walked into the kitchen, made myself a cup of black coffee, and sipped it between bites of yesterday’s stale sandwich. Then another long, scalding shower, scrubbing myself until my skin felt new, or at least separate from the night before. Fresh clothes, keys in hand, and I got in the car.

Half of me wanted to go to work and pretend nothing had happened.

The other half wanted to walk into the nearest police station, even if I had nothing that would make sense to say.

I went with the first option.

So I spent the morning taking X-rays of dogs that swallowed things they shouldn’t, socks batteries, God knows what else, checking tabbies whose kidneys were finally waving the white flag, smiling and nodding whenever the job required it.

I was in the middle of a routine checkup on a green parrot named Polly, who kept lunging for my stethoscope like it owed her money, when my phone buzzed in my pocket, slow and lazy at first.

Then again.

And again.

A steady, insistent tremor, like it was tapping its foot and waiting for me to get a clue.

I finally excused myself and pulled it out.

The screen was a mess of missed calls from Samantha.

Dozens of them.

And beneath those, message after message stacking on top of each other, flooding the screen so fast the notifications blurred into a single smear of panic.

I didn’t even think, I called her back immediately. My mind sprinted ahead of the ringing, car crash, her parents, the house on fire, God forbid another damn cat. Every worst-case scenario piled on top of the next.

But when she picked up, she wasn’t crying.

She was breathless.

Happy.

Almost vibrating through the speaker.

“SOMEONE FOUND TOMMY!” she practically screamed, her voice cracking with joy.

And for a second, the world just stopped.

“What?” The word tore out of me, strangled, thin, like my own voice didn’t believe what it was saying. Like it already knew, the lie should’ve collapsed by now.

“He just, came in!” Samantha rushed on, breathless, almost tripping over her own excitement. “Some fat guy, middle-aged, kind of sweaty, asking if we’d lost a cat!”

My stomach bottomed out.

“And he had Tommy,” she said, and the joy in her voice felt like a knife sliding between my ribs. “He had him, babe. Said he found him wandering near the outskirts of town. He’s a little dirty but otherwise he’s fine! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?”

Her voice cracked on the last word.

I didn’t answer.

Because I could believe it.

And my hands had started to shake.

“Babe? Babe, are you there? Can I drop him off soon? I want you to check him out- y’know, make sure no cat messed with him.”

She’d said cat, not car, but it didn’t matter. My brain snagged on the wrongness of all of it, the impossible overlap of truth and nightmare. I still couldn’t believe any of it was happening. Couldn’t believe the lie hadn’t detonated in my face.

My hand dragged across my forehead, and only then did I notice how slick it was, sweat beading at my hairline like I’d just sprinted a mile.

“Yeah… yeah,” I muttered. My voice sounded far away, like it belonged to someone calmer than I was. “Drop him by… anytime. Whenever.”

I hung up before she could hear the panic creeping in through my teeth.

The phone slipped back into my pocket, disappearing into the dark like something I didn’t want to look at. The leftover notifications still buzzed against my leg, faint, persistent, like a ghost tapping from inside a coffin lid.

I turned back to Polly and her owner, forcing a smile that barely fit on my face.

“She’s fine,” I said, voice thin. “See you next month.”

But the thought kept chewing at me, buzzing in my skull like flies crowding a fresh corpse, ribs of truth jutting out from under the rotting lie I’d wrapped around everything.

Then I just folded.

Sat down on the cold tile floor beneath one of the cabinet shelves, knees drawn in, like I was ducking from gunfire, only I could hear.

I stayed like that for what felt like an eternity, time stretching thin and strange, until I heard footsteps coming down the hall.

Samantha.

I pushed myself up fast, pretending I’d just dropped something, like I’d been crouched down hunting for a pen that rolled away instead of hiding behind the cabinet like a nervous wreck. But the truth was sitting right there on the counter in front of me, a blue cat carrier. The thing I’d really lost stuffed neatly inside it like evidence.

She rounded the table, saw me, and practically launched herself at me. Her arms wrapped tight, too tight, squeezing the air out of my lungs. I felt like an almost-empty tube of toothpaste, one good press away from spilling whatever guts I have left in me.

“ISN'T IT EXCITING? Our little family is whole again!”

She beamed at me, that wide white grin of hers almost too bright, then pulled away just enough to press a kiss to my lips. I prayed it didn’t taste like rot. She gave the carrier a gentle tap before looking back up at me.

“So, when are you getting off?”

“In like an hour… half an hour.”

My eyes were glued to the carrier. No way in hell was I staying here for an hour. Not now.

“Great!”

Samantha grinned and leaned down to peek inside, giving whatever was in there a tiny, cheerful wave.

“See ya soon, buddy. Have fun with daddy, alright?”

Her voice went soft, sweet before she straightened again.

“Oh, and the guy slipped me his phone number, just in case.” She said it like she was offering me a coupon from the Sunday paper. “He told me he didn’t need this junk anymore, but if you could call him and maybe drop it off after you bring Tommy home? That’d be just great.”

“Phone number?”

The words fell out of my mouth like I’d never heard the term before, like telephone was some new plague spreading through town.

She snorted. “I didn’t know you were the jealous type!”

That smirk of hers cut across her face like a fresh knife mark. “Not in a creepy way, alright? Just… y’know.”

“How did he look?”

She screwed up her face, digging around in her brain like the memory was stuck behind cobwebs.

“Uhhh… fat guy. Real pale. And he reeked, God, he reeked…of like…” She rotated her hand, searching.

“Bleach?” I offered.

“Yeah. Yeah, like chemicals and cigarette smoke had a baby and then left it in a hot car.”

She glanced around the room again, like something in here might suddenly explain itself if she stared hard enough.

“But… how did you know, though?”

“He stopped by here a couple times,” I said. My tongue felt too big in my mouth. “With a cat.”

“OOOHH. Alright, got it!”

She laughed, bright and careless, like nothing in the world had ever gone wrong. “Yeah, see you in a bit! Love you!”

I watched her leave, watched the shape of her slip away from the doorframe and vanish down the hall like a ghost.

Now I was alone with it, sitting on my table like a package someone should have burned instead of delivered. I didn’t know if I was ready to see how he looked all “adjusted.” My hand drifted to the scalpel. Cold metal, thin as a whisper, steady in my grip. I squeezed it until the handle bit into my palm. After what I’d done with that screwdriver, I figured I could manage this, too.

I unlatched the crate. One piece of metal slid off another with a sound like a tired machine screaming in its sleep. The door swung open with a long, rusty whine, like something that had been left out in the rain too many nights.

I stepped back, wedging myself between two wooden shelves painted white. Funny thought, the blood splatter would look beautiful against that clean backdrop if this thing decided to go for my throat.

Instead, an orange shape eased out of the carrier.

And a sound followed.

A purr. A warm, rolling, family purr.

Not the metallic, broken rattle I’d heard before. Not forced, not wrong.

This one was soft, organic.

The scalpel slid out of my hand, clattering against the floor as my fingers uncurled in something like relief, weak, shaky, stupid relief.

Because it looked like Tommy.

The fat bastard who’d been reduced to a bloody street pancake was somehow back again. Standing there. Breathing. Purring. A perfect, uncanny copy dropped straight out of some cosmic printer. Sure, one of the hind legs dragged just a hair, and one eye drifted a little too far left, as if it couldn’t quite remember where the world was supposed to be but it was him.

It was fucking him, in all his high-cholesterol, hairball-hoarding glory.

I dug out my phone, thumb trembling just enough to piss me off. The second the screen lit up, I dialed Samantha.

“I’ll be late,” I said, already rehearsing the lie in my head. “I need to run some extra checkups on Tommy… an hour, maybe?”

It rolled off my tongue too easily. That was the part that scared me, how natural lying had become, like slipping into a pair of worn shoes.

And before I knew it, I was back in the car, engine coughing to life. The blue carrier sat on the passenger seat like evidence of a crime. I was driving out to return it to its rightful owner.

After all, he deserved to get something back too.",1,1764608431.0,creepcast,0,0.67,False

Transphobes have a history of underrepresenting trans people, overrepresenting detransitioners, and [overrepresenting the number of medals won by trans athletes](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=flSS1tjoxf0) by misrepresenting cherry-picked studies that [disgraced](https://www.tumblr.com/assignedmale/748476649634414592/hey-its-my-birthday-all-i-want-is-coffee-to) their makers as [frauds and caused their clinics to shut down](https://www.tumblr.com/assignedmale/746305164555812864/eighty-percent). They put surveys on transphobic websites, [ask cis people more than trans people](https://www.tumblr.com/assignedmale/129025933417), conflate public opinion with fact, conflate crossdressers with trans people, count non-binary people and people they lost contact to as desisters, and throw the studies away that - after all this - still disagree with them. 

You might have seen [this graph](https://x.com/epkaufm/status/1978074195767480659) being passed around by transphobes saying things like ""transgenderism is over"" and ""gender ideology has been defeated"". But anyone familiar with the transgender community can immediately tell that [the survey only asked about gender identity, thereby making no distinction between binary trans people and cis people](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/serious-trans-vibes/kinda-sad/viewer?title_no=206579&episode_no=1238). Transphobes, however, tend to conflate trans and non-binary people, leading them to [say ""only two genders"" to binary trans people](https://www.reddit.com/r/AccidentalAlly/comments/1p2l6t9/saw_this_today_in_replies_to_a_trans_woman/). 

We need to anticipate this! Whenever there's a survey about transness, remember that transphobes will try to misrepresent it and act accordingly! If a survey asks you if you want men in women's sports/bathrooms/shelters/whatever, say yes! If a survey asks you if you wanna pervert language, say yes! If a survey asks you what gender you identify as without asking if you're trans or not, say non-binary, even if you are just a binary trans person! They wanna silence our voices so you must amplify our voices! 

What's more, even if you are cis, you should still say you're non-binary! Because, if you believe that trans women are women, this alone makes you a proponent of what they call ""gender ideology""! If 100% of a specific group of people supports trans rights, the fact that they also happen to be made entirely out of cis people does not indicate any ""waning of gender ideology"", yet this is exactly what that survey will be used for! 

If you wanna help trans people, even if you don't believe in non-binary people, call yourself non-binary in those surveys! Say that you identify as neither male nor female! Say that your pronouns are they/them! Give yourself a genderneutral name or just pick a random word from the dictionary! Wear the colors of the non-binary flag if you really wanna piss off transphobes! \(Unless they aren't familiar with the flag. Then switch to the 🏳️‍⚧️ trans flag or even the 🏳️‍🌈 rainbow flag.\) And if you can't answer a question, just say it's not your job to educate people! Anyone can do it! If [Josh Seiter can fool the trans community](https://youtu.be/8ObW9kf4TGs) then you can DEFINITELY fool the transphobes!!!!!!!!!! 

/uj I recently attended a presentation about trans people where I asked about the difference between ""non-binary"" and ""genderqueer"". The explanation I received was that ""non-binary"" describes your gender identity and ""genderqueer"" describes your political opinion about gender. For example, a member of a traditional cultural third gender would be non-binary due to being neither male nor female but not genderqueer due to living traditionally; and a drag queen would be genderqueer due to refusing to be defined by traditional gender roles but not non-binary due to still identifying as male. Also, did you know that Alice Weidel from the transphobic German AfD party is married with children to another woman but explicitly denied identifying as ""queer""?",12,1764608403.0,transgendercirclejerk,2,1.0,False

I’ve been feeling this little tug lately—the kind that says “you should probably talk to more humans who aren’t your barista or the person at the checkout line.” So here I am. 😅

I’m hoping to meet a few kind, down-to-earth people in the area who are up for real friendship—the kind where we can grab coffee without awkward small talk, go for a walk just to get some fresh air, share dumb memes at 2 AM, or simply exist in each other’s company without pressure.

I’m not looking for anything romantic, just genuinely good people who want connection, laughter, and maybe the occasional existential rant about why we put things off until “tomorrow” knowing good and well we won’t.

A bit about me:
• I’m pretty easygoing, introverted-but-not-too-introverted
• Always down to talk about music, random shower thoughts, or whatever hobby I’m hyperfocused on this week
• Big fan of chill vibes, nature, and people who know how to be kind

I've finally had enough,"TL;DR: MIL offered a fake apology, I decided to continue seeing In-laws only for the sake of twins. first time seeing them again and one of the twins falls off a table because of negligent FIL.

this is an update for my previous post, I know it's long but do read for context:
https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/s/Z8a0qnvOTI

side note: English is not my native language so some parts of the conversations could be poorly translated, bear with me lol. 

let's go back to the beginning. 
DH and I had many exhausting talks on this topic and he decided he was going to have a serious talk with his parents. he laid down the rules - no more shit talking about me, no criticism of my parenting, etc. the talk went well but MIL insisted she wanted to talk to me, ""woman to woman"". I didn't like this at all, but I wanted to show DH who his mother really is since I was sure I wasn't getting a sincere apology, just some more excuses. 
after she contacted me, I said how I think she said everything she wanted to say, but we can go for coffee if she's insisting. she said she had some things she wanted to say to me for a long time, but never had the chance. this left me genuinely terrified lol as I was expecting another shit talk and more accusations. so it kinda was. 

basically, her little sugar coated, circumlocutive talk was how we are a conflict of generations and sometimes she has a bad day so things slip out the wrong way. 
so since you view things differently and whenever you have a bad day, you can just say nasty things and I should sweep it under a rug and smile? na-ah, ma'am. I'm holding you accountable and you're not getting away with it. she did say she was sorry for those messages. 

I told her I know about her other nasty demeaning messages she sent after the fight with DH where she's implying I'm lazy and modifying the truth to say I only worked for two months and quit during the whole time I was with DH. ""well I didn't mean it like that, I don't know exactly how long you worked (YES, YOU DO, I talked about my shitty little job ALL THE TIME), that's not what I meant, I only mean well, I am a good person (repeated many times throughout the hour as if she's trying to convince herself)"" yada yada yada. 

she said ""I'm sorry if that offended you"", I said that's not an apology. she refused to take responsibility and properly apologise to the point where I said I'm leaving this very moment if she doesn't. then she crossed her arms, slightly rolled her eyes and said ""okay, I'm taking accountability"" with a smirk on her face, as if what I'm demanding is some ridiculous child play.  
I should have left there and then. go easy on me guys, I'm still learning how to draw proper boundaries. 
I realised anyways I am never going to get an apology, as if that would change anything since I hate all of them anyway. 
 
she also went on a tirade about my own mother and me (who is just as much of a JNM as MIL is a JNMIL but that's not the point here), saying, quote: ""I always felt an evil energy from you two"". what??! 

I guess the whole point of this meeting was for her to:
- make more excuses 
- offer fake apologies 
- point the finger at me and other people so that we can take the focus off of her
- then sweet talk and compliment her way out

I made it very clear the whole time that I'm not buying her bullshit, she accused me of being too harsh lol. I know I can appear VERY intimidating when I get angry, but what did she expect? 

she also complained to both me and DH how she only gets to see the babies for an ""hour"" weekly on a strictly scheduled time and how she can't come anytime she pleases. I explained that those visits are scheduled because surprise, surprise, babies have their own schedules and 3-4:30pm is a timeframe where in-laws can spend 1.5 hrs of uninterrupted time with the boys because they don't have to eat nor sleep. I also said that anyone's visit with a baby doesn't revolve around them but around a baby. 


we eventually ended our little ridiculous coffee date on good terms, until she hugged me and said I am like the daughter she never had. words cannot express my level of ick. I said good relationships take time to build and that I will need a lot of time to change my perspective on certain things, then we parted ways.

fast forward til yesterday. her and JNFIL came to visit first time after all of this. twin B has this habit where he cries hysterically whenever he sees MIL, recently twin A started doing the same but he's easily consoled while twin B takes like 5 minutes to settle. I genuinely believe twin B is HSP like me and picks up on other people's BS right away. he will eventually settle and be able to be in the same room as her, maybe even interact a little. 

this time was no different. I settled him, he eventually went to play next to FIL. FIL, MIL and I pretty much greyrocked each other, FIL placed baby B on a coffee table to sit and played with him. I didn't like the idea, but I thought FIL is careful enough to not let twin B get hurt. I watched over the boys like a hawk until I laid my eyes off for two full seconds. DH saw what happened - JNFIL had his hand on the table next to twin B's leg, B reached for something on the floor, toppled over the table and OVER FIL'S HAND while he DID NOTHING to stop it, fell vertically straight on his head and twisted his neck in an ungodly angle while the rest of his body toppled and fell on the floor. 

I immediately snatched him and took him to the kitchen and I overhead DH scolding FIL but in my opinion he was too easy on him. DH later admitted he underreacted too. baby soon stopped crying and I figured he's fine except a bruise on the top of his forehead. 

I went back and confronted FIL in a serious tone saying he should be more careful, what was he thinking etc, while FIL acted like it was the babies fault (!!), saying, ""it happened in a second"", ""babies are quick"" ""that's just how babies are"" ""accidents happen"". I insisted that this shouldn't have happened and I said I didn't give birth to my babies for him to throw them off of a table! and as this bickering went back and forth, my rage amplified. 
then he said something like: ""I'm taking accountability, and so?"" in a very arrogant tone. 
I snapped. ""so? so??! SO??!"" 
he told me I should lower my voice. I yelled ""this is MY HOUSE and I can talk here however I please and if you don't like my tone of voice - there's the door!!"" while swiftly pointing at it. 

he got up and started walking towards me while saying something I can't even remember, honestly it looked like he wanted to punch me OR start preaching me in the lines of listen to me you little POS or something lol. I'm not scared. that's when DH intervened and FIL stormed out. MIL followed, not before saying ""babies are rubbery, you're making a big deal out of it"". I heard a lot of bickering in the hallway, MIL calling DH a ""Judas"", saying she didn't raise him like that. DH finds that hilarious 🤣

anyway, FIL apologised to DH via text later that evening, admitting his mistake, but called me out for me saying he threw the baby off the floor or being aggressive or whatever and said something like he has nothing to talk about with a person who showed him the door. DH defended me but I have no desire to ever have contact with them. after all this it's pretty clear they are a menace to my kids and I think I have a full right to refuse them to have any contact with my babies after this.

1pbi3ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/Upperwestside/comments/1pbi3ws/mom_uws_experiences/,MOM UWS Experiences ??,"Hi all, just hoping to hear some other opinions/experiences on The Medical Offices of Manhattan on 72nd. I have been having the strangest experience with them and wondering if it’s time to switch….

I have been on ADHD medication off and on for years now, and consistently for the past 2 years. I moved states so I settled with them for my new primary doctor to manage my ADHD med prescriptions. The first visit since I had no recent documentation they asked me the typical questions, took blood pressure etc. Then she opted that I get a heart ultrasound (an echo I guess). I went along with it but I’ve only ever had an annual EKG in the past which I thought is all you need really unless you explain concerning symptoms to your doctor. Echo took FOREVER and was done by a practitioner in training and another nurse had to come in and help her. Then they made me wait for a phonecall from Cardiologist before I could leave the office and get my first prescription. Cardiologist told me everything looked normal. I was a bit annoyed but whatever. Insurance covered most of it but I thought it was overkill instead of just doing an EKG. Then, she practically tried to force me to order the heart monitor and wear it for 4 days? I told her I would think about it but don’t think I need it. Next month I come back to refill, and she tries to beg me AGAIN to do the heart monitor? I said no thank you I really don’t think I need it nor is nothing concerning about my heart that you or I have seen. She acted weird about it? Like I thought she wasn’t going to let me get my next prescription until I agreed. Next month I come back and see a NEW nurse practitioner, she does the same thing! Really pushed this heart monitor but was less aggressive than the last doctor. Last month, saw the same new nurse and that day I hadn’t eaten yet, I had a coffee and had taken one of my meds a few hours before. My blood pressure was “a little high” when they took it and they FREAKED OUT on me….came in and practically forced me to do an EKG (which I complied because at this point they were freaking me out) I explained to them that I had taken my meds earlier this morning and I also have anxiety so now I’m feeling anxious and my heart rate is obviously beating faster cause I’m panicked that something’s wrong with me?! They did the EKG and said everything looks normal but there’s a “very slight movement in my valve that concerns them” ? I freaked out and said omg well now I’m scared should I stop taking my meds etc etc. She laughed and said no no there’s nothing abnormal about your EKG but we just think it’s best if you make an appt with our cardiologist AND do the heart monitor. I told her AGAIN that I’m really not interested in doing the monitor and paying for it and asked her SEVERAL times if there’s anything concerning or abnormal about my EKG that they’re pushing this so hard. She just kept saying “no I promise you’re fine but it’s really recommended”. Then she prescribed me my month dose and told me she won’t give me my next months until I do the heart monitor…she ordered it basically without my permission and I asked if I would be charged and she said not until I do the monitor. I called again today because it’s time for my next prescription fill and they said the same thing. You need to come do the heart monitor and insurance will ONLY cover it if I do the full four days. 

My old doctor has NEVER pushed anything like this on me or tried to force me to do a heart monitor. And because of ONE morning my blood pressure spiked now they’re being extremely strict on me and making me scared that something’s wrong?? I just find it really odd and frustrating. I’ve read a few things on here about similar experiences so was curious to hear more. ",4,1764608347.0,Upperwestside,24,0.67,False

Like some other members of the club nobody wanted to join, and despite being four years out from a RALP, I still have some minor drips during the day.

I know that coffee is a bladder irritant and we are constantly advised to cut down on it.

I now have a single ""real"" espresso in the morning, but I do like to drink decaf espressos (well, at least the kind you can make with a Nespresso capsule machine) during the day.

1pbi1k7,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1pbi1k7/is_my_mum_a_narcissist/,Is my mum a narcissist?,"Through a recent drama between my brother and mum, where she repeatedly sneaked into his house (she lives in an annexe with adjoining door), we have both come to realise that she might be a narcissist or at least have narcissitic defenses. I wanted to explore this with others who have had similar experiences. The purpose being to get a better understanding of how she might be 'diagnosed', and to get ideas about how to move forwards whilst not cutting her out of my life.

Brief overview of recent drama first. They agreed she could come in and use the bath (she only has shower) if she first messaged to ask, and then locked the door behind her after. My brother suspected she was taking liberties and ended up leaving a webcam on whilst he and his parner and child were away. He was shocked to see her come in without permission and nose about the place. She, at first denied it and tried to change the story. This has now happened on 3 other occasiosn, each time followed by a falling out. Basically she has taking no responsibility and each time said it was either an emrgency (e.g. needed to wash and her sister was using the bathroom in her annexe) or that she thought he would not mind. The latest drama has ended in my brother stopping communication almost completetely and she has moved into a friends spare room in protest.

Victim/martyr: she has always maintained a role of helping people in need, often to the point that it negatively effects her family and herself. For example taking in people with addictions etc, which is all well and good, but perhaps without respecting our boundaries or wellbeing etc. She cries in public a lot, especially if things don't go her way or she finds a situation challenging. This has been embarrassing growing up with it.

Parenting: she moved us around countless times in an attemtp to get my dad to follow because he was in an affair. All the time seemingly not considering disruption to our schooling/loss of friends etc. The story was it was to get him back so we had a dad, but I now think it was about her and not losing him for herself. When I speak about childhood she always says she tried her best, and it was very diffiuclt as a single parent. There have also been tears when it is discussed in too much depth.

On the weekend in a public place (coffee morning at local community centre) she asked me if I loved her, and asked me to tell her in front of three people I'd never met but presumably she did. I said it, and she did not say back, and rarely does she say it to me. Afterwards she started sobbing as I left, and the people next to her looked at me as if I had done something wrong. This was after seeming to be very happy and relaxed. And I think it was linked to the drama with my brother, perhaps a way of garnering my sympathy. The truth is a don't feel much when she cries now. But, this situation made me feel quite low, and a bit used in a way. I felt like allowed myself to be manipulated. This brings up both anger and grief, and I'd like to not be put in that situation.

Anyway, my brother wants his son (6 years old) to have a granny buit is worried what she might say to him or the games she might play. I don't think she has ever been particulalry nasty or abusive in the sense of belittling us or saying horrible things. But there is codependence there and for sure guilt tripping. He mentioned he thinks she can appear a bit jealous of him, as perhaps she is not always the centre of attention.

I see two sides to her. When she is relaxed I get on with her well, and there does not seem to be a game being played. But then she flips into victimhood  when there is a threat to her appearance as a good person. 

Does this fit the pattern of anyone elses parent? And is there any practical advice to maintain a relationship? I care about her, but don't want to be manipulated.",1,1764608201.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1pbi01g,https://i.redd.it/wauwle3tcm4g1.jpeg,Rev Cafe - A Vintage Moto Inspired Coffee Brand,"Howdy! Recently joined this sub but have been racing motocross my whole life and have a passion for vintage motorcycles / culture. My dad grew up in SoCal in the 70's so growing up I watched On Any Sunday practically once or twice a month as a kid. I even worked on some cool vintage restoration projects with my dad in my early and mid-childhood. I own a few vintage bikes and there's just something about the feeling you get when riding old bikes that is just unable to be replicated.

I recently launched a vintage moto inspired coffee brand named Rev Cafe ([revmotocafe.com](http://revmotocafe.com) and **revmotocafe** on instagram). We just (finally) went live with our new custom coffee blend named **Cold Start**, with the packaging design (and really all designs) done completely in-house by myself and my good friend / graphic designer. I spent quite a bit of time trying 25+ different coffees to get the blend where I wanted it and am very proud of the result we have achieved - it's a great daily drinker that is super versatile and tastes great no matter how it's made (espresso, drip coffee, pour overs, cold brew, lattes, etc). 

The packaging is inspired by vintage motorcycle oil cans, and the coffee is roasted to order, ensuring it arrives super fresh and only a few days after being roasted. We also have some shirts we have designed, with all being very intentional on how it integrates a reverence (a word used as the core of ""Rev"" Cafe's concept) for vintage motorcycles and a passion for coffee's unique medium as a daily ritual before going out into the ""real"" world. 

I have always wanted to combine my passion for vintage motorcycles and specialty coffee and felt like I finally had the ability to work on this project that has been a ""one day"" goal of mine. I worked in specialty coffee for many years and even owned a brick-and-mortar cafe for a couple years. I ended up going back to school and now work a 9-5 corporate job but have always wanted to own a vintage moto inspired coffee shop. There is a real possibility for Rev Cafe to have a brick-and-mortar shop in the works sometime in 2026. While I wait for that opportunity to materialize, I wanted to get the brand started and start sharing it out with other enthusiasts that might enjoy great coffee and cool vintage merch!

**Short version: these are bite-sized updates on things generally not reported by the local paper, Facebook groups, and other sources of news.**

**If there are specific topics you want to hear about or you have feedback, feel free to send me a message or leave a comment.**

At the bottom are a couple links if you are interesting in knowing more about what the Village is up to.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

**Cook County DOT relocation –** 2222 Hammond Dr building to be demolished. Schaumburg worked a deal with Cook County DOT to relocate here so that their current location (Meacham/Algonquin), considered an eye-sore, could be redeveloped into something that matches the surrounding area (especially with the new 90 North neighborhood). American Demolition was awarded the bid. This was the same contractor who demolished the Atcher Municipal Center and managed to stay on budget and within schedule, avoiding escalating costs that are typical with any contracting company.

**Braintree Dr Redevelopment –** From Wise Rd to Bode Rd, pavement will be reconstructed, a roundabout will be constructed at Weathersfield/Braintree, and the on-street bike paths will be moved to off-street. Additionally, 13,300ft of aging cast iron water main will be replaced. Project is expected to begin in the spring of 2026. The Village will cover 20-25% of the cost, with rest being funded through federal funding. Portions of the Motor Fuel Tax will be utilized to help fund the Village’s 20%

**Sister Cities:** The Village will host Schaumburg, Germany in April 2026. Discussions are beginning about starting a relationship with a city in India.

**New Pickleball Facility:** Consideration was given and approved for franchise, Dill Dinkers, to create a pickleball facility at 895 American Lane. The property was originally built for with a mixture of office and warehouse space.

·       Per Schaumburg parking requirements, they will be required to have 51 parking spaces, leaving an excess of 25 spaces. (You will start seeing me calling out Schaumburg’s excessive allotment of parking spaces in these posts.)

**Golden Corridor YMCA:** a new Health and Recreation facility will be started at the former At Home/24-hr Fitness building located on 101 Barrington Rd. This site used to contain a K-Mart/Eagle Foods (1992), Little Ceasars Pizza (1993), Pizza Hut (1994),  Starbucks (1996), Lowe’s (2004), Napoli Per Tutti (2018), and then the aforementioned At Home/24-hr Fitness (2019).

·       Per Schaumburg parking requirements, this business must have 178 spaces with an extra 345 leftover. (For the whole parking lot, 807 spaces are required for all businesses presently located here with an excess of 294. Of course, most of those 807 go unused on a daily basis.)

**Public Safety:** Fire Chief Walters recommended disbanding the Medical Reserve Corps, a group of volunteers utilized to assist the emergency response teams. For a few years, it has been challenging to find things for them to do and it is time-consuming for staff. A recommendation was made to direct these volunteers to Hanover Township, Red Cross, Hofman Estates, etc. When asked why Hanover’s was more successful than Schaumburg’s Chief Walters stated it is due to Hanover operates more like a volunteer fire department. A growing number of municipalities are disbanding their programs, such as Arlington Heights and Mount Prospect.

**Olympic Park:** The Parks District estimates about 1,800,000 million visitors come here every year, many of whom come from the surrounding region and will eat at our restaurants, shop at our stores, stay at our hotels, etc. It is certainly a draw in the Northwest Suburbs.

**Spring Valley:** The Parks District estimates about 203,000 visitors come every year, getting people (kids and adults, alike) off their screens and outdoors

**Schaumburg Home Inspections:** There are 12,000 single family homes in Schaumburg, all of which are inspected within a 4-year period. Missing handrails appear to be among the top code violation, but there was debate regarding if many of these homes were built without them to begin with. Either the home was built without handrails when the owner purchased it or they were removed by the owner. Residents have five years to comply.

**New coffee shop:** apparently, there is a new coffee shop behind Checkers (on Wise Rd) on the east side of the building. A new walk-up window was added for it.

**Short-Term Rentals:** Schaumburg’s current rule is short-term rental (ex: Airbnb’s) cannot be owned by a corporate entity

**H-Mart:** although delayed in its opening, a new sign is up, 13 store front windows will be added on the east side, and several landscaping modifications needed to occur. It’s still unclear what has led to the year and a half delay from its original opening date.

**Raising chickens:** consideration was given to a homeowner requesting to raise chickens in their backyard. The chickens would be located in a coop. In the Village’s history, only two applications have been approved to raise chickens: once in 1993, but the owner had already been raising them for 18 years. They were given permission to raise 20 chicken. The second time was in 2023, and the owner had already been raising chickens for over 20 years. They were also granted to raise 20 chickens and…a duck!

**Coffee with the Council:**

·       **E-bike regulations:** following a Coffee with the Council meeting, in response to a resident’s question about e-bike regulation, trustees said they are waiting to see how other communities are managing e-bikes before considering any changes to the Village’s current e-bike regulations.

·       **Bears stadium:** should the Bears stadium move to Arlington Heights, trustees believe the most that will happen is overflow of visitors to hotels and restaurants

·       **Federal cuts:** despite federal funding cuts to Illinois District 8, trustees have not yet seen an impact on the local government level since they received all expected funding for this year. However, next year may be different.

·       **Alternative housing:** in response to if the Village is adding duplexes/triplexes/quadplexes to the housing mix, trustees said 18,000 of these types of housing already exist within the village (this includes condos and townhomes). Unfortunately, developers only want to build $600-800k unites. In response to accessory dwelling units (tiny homes owners could build/install in their backyards), trustees expressed doubt about the possibility, due to infrastructure and belief that current open space on single-family home lots would not be able to handle it.

**Village of Schaumburg’s property tax levy**:

·       90% is now entirely dedicated to pensions. Given rising costs, it is expected the levy will be fully committed to pension contributions, leaving nothing leftover for Fire and Police Department operation budgets.

·       For the average Schaumburg home valued at $400,000, the Village’s portion of the property tax bill is estimated to decrease from $516.37 to $437.54.

**Remington and Basswood Business Area**: efforts will be made to ensure the property owners (the businesses found within this area) contribute to improvements and maintenance of the area, such as new tree plantings, installation of benches and garbage cans, rehabilitation of the 2,700-foot walking path, maintain landscape and turf, trash collection, the detention pond and trees.

**Stipend for Committee Members**: Residents who donate and commit their time serving in the Village’s many committees receive an annual stipend plus $25 for each meeting attended.

**Septemberfest:**

·       It is estimated a total of 100k people attended this 3-day event.

·       Many businesses contributed money or resources to the event, such as, Duly & Health, Ben & Jerry’s, Miller Lite, Comcast/Xfinity, Schaumburg Park District, Divine Signs, Sons & Daughters of Italy, and State Farm.

·       There were 149 crafters (the people who sit at those tents you walk up to and maybe buy something from), all coming from states such as Florida, Colorado, Tennessee, Iowa and Illinois

·       Despite the new layout due to the Village Hall reconstruction, many attendants actually said they preferred then new layout. The Septemberfest Committee will give strong consideration to opt for the new layout for future Septemberfests.

**Loeber Farm Redevelopment:** Nitti Group was granted a TIF (freezes property taxes of an area for a period of time to attract businesses. Property taxes are later incrementally restored to their expected amount) for the Loeber Farm. They propose building 43 single-family detached units, 37 rowhouses, and 42 townhomes. Development would start beginning-2026 and the first sales would start end-2026.

1pbhxvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pbhxvt/mf_the_end/,[MF] The End,"That was it then. Betsy was gone. 
Her body was still warm. I tested the heat of her flesh and my finger made a dent, the same way it would have a few short minutes ago. She didn’t move, though, and she couldn’t talk anymore, but I couldn’t be sure that the voice she listened to inside her head wasn’t still talking to her.
I read once about a French nobleman who, on his way to the guillotine, said that after his head was cut off, he would blink for as long as he could if he was able to. Reportedly, he blinked for almost thirty seconds. 

Thirty seconds had probably gone by since she stopped breathing. It seemed reasnable to believe that the voice wasn’t talking to her anymore.
I hadn’t slept well since she went into hospice a week ago. Hadn’t really slept at all the last couple of days.
I’m seventy-five years old, and I had never seen a person actually die before. There wasn’t much drama. She just slowed down and finally stopped. It was pretty easy … for her.
The hospice lady patted my shoulder and said, “You take all the time you need, honey.” She went into the kitchen, and after some rattling around, the coffee maker started sputtering.

I cried with my head in my hands until my stomach hurt and my tears ran dry. My breath came in quick jerks for a while. Finally, it settled down. Every once in a while, I’d sneak a peek at Betsy’s body, and then cry again. Eventually, my body quit responding. Worry crept into the room with us. What would I do now? How did the washing machine work? Who would touch me now? Would anyone ever hold me in their arms again?
I sobbed a few times, then I got bored. The whole dying process had been stupidly boring. A lot of waiting. The way I’m built, I need to keep busy or I go crazy,but right now, I had to sit in here with her body for a respectable period of time. I thought about going and getting my drawing pad. I was never going to get a model who would hold still better. Would that be okay? Betsy wouldn’t mind. Art was one of the things that held our marriage together. I didn’t want to scandalize the hospice lady, though, so I figured it probably wouldn’t be the best thing.
Still, I needed something to do, so I took her hands in both of mine and closed my eyes. 
My promise to her that I would call our son as soon as she passed sat on me, crushing the breath from my chest. I didn’t wanna do it. I know that’s why she made me promise. She knew if I didn’t do it right away, I’d put it off and a week would go by, and then a month, and then a year, and then it would be too late. 
I still didn’t want to do it. Oscar already hated me. Now he was going to associate me with his mother‘s death. Probably blame me. I decided to rest for a few minutes before I called him.
The next thing that popped into my head wasn’t a memory of reality at all; it was a story I used to tell when people asked how we got together. I always told everyone we met in a grocery store in Milan. That I came around the corner of the aisle, and she was holding a jar of gherkin pickles. Large. Spicy. When she saw me, we made eye contact, and as though a conductor had raised a baton, we both rose erect, stopped breathing, and simultaneously, I looked at her breasts and she looked at my crotch.
The lighting must have been flattering. She dropped the gherkin pickles. The glass shattered at her feet. Pickles and juice went everywhere.
We both looked down at the disaster, then up into each other’s startled eyes.
I put my finger to my lips in the universal symbol for quiet, and reached for her. She came to me, and we slipped around the corner of the aisle, and out into the hot summer night.
That was the story I told people about how we met, but it wasn’t the truth. It was just a joke between us. It was a stupid thing to think about as I sat there with my hand on top of hers, my arm resting on the hospital bed, and my forehead bowed.
I had a better memory next. It was the time she saved a little girl from being run over by a motorcycle in Mexico. Really, all she did was scream at the clueless motorcycle rider who was powering up the hill when the tiny girl darted away from her father and directly into the path of the front motorcycle tire, which was about her size, but would’ve won the fight easily. The scream surprised the motorcycle rider, who instinctively hit his brakes and veered to the right, running over Betsy’s great and second toes and breaking them both in two places. The little girl dashed safely in front of the motorcycle. The father, from whom she had escaped, calmly crossed the street behind the motorcycle and called to his daughter as he headed up a side alley. Nothing happened to the little girl, but I’m pretty sure if Betsy hadn’t screamed, something would have. She saved a life, but instead of getting credit for it, she got two crushed toes. 
Anyway, those were the digressions of my internal monologue after I closed my eyes and as I drifted through the past, while both my hands cradled hers.
Then my knee itched, so I scratched it.
The coffee was starting to smell good. I was so tired.
I cheated and opened my eyes and looked at her again. She was lying on her back with her hands on her stomach. All the folds and bags in her face and throat drooped toward the center of the Earth. The brow line, nose, and muzzle of the mouth projected above the sagging flesh like mountain peaks poking out of rolling foothills. They looked strong and sharp, almost youthful, much as they had appeared when I first met her as a little girl. 

I was eight or nine, and walking my dog, Barkley, with my mother, when she came right up to us. 
I considered it beneath my dignity to notice girls, but secretly they made me very uncomfortable.
My mother, for her part, had no idea that this was the person who would nurse her through the last two years of her life. 
Our dog was a mutt. We got her at the pound. She was half Border Collie and half Chihuahua. I loved her a lot, but my mom did most of the actual taking care of the needy animal. 
So Betsy came right up to us, actually, she came right up to Barkley, got down on one knee, and started scratching him behind the ear. Barkley opened his mouth, stuck his tongue out, and hung his head to give her better access. 
Mom and I just stood there and watched. After an interval of scratching, she said, “All right, Dogger, gotta go. You be good.” And she got up and skipped away. Never talked to us. I certainly didn’t talk to her. I was scared of her. She was too cute. 
I wouldn’t actually talk to her until we were both in the seventh grade.

Betsy’s hands were starting to get cold, not freezing, but no longer warm. I let go of them and sat up straight. 
A piece of lint on the floor caught my attention. It was probably some fluff off one of the sweaters she was always wearing near the end. Her body quit making heat. The lint was dancing in some kind of breeze. When I focused on it, the room went out of focus. I closed one eye and then the other, but nothing worked, so I lost interest in it.
For a period of time, I didn’t really have any thoughts. It’s unusual for my internal monologue to shut down. I guess the little voice in there was as exhausted as I was.
Then I thought of coffee again.

I got up and went into the kitchen. The hospice lady handed me a cup of coffee, and I sat down at the table.
Everything looked the same, yet different. There was to be no more normal for me … not for a while.
I closed my eyes and rested.
The hospice lady sat down opposite me with her own cup of coffee. “There are some calls that have to be made. Do you want me to do that for you?” 
It was a dumb question, but she probably had to ask it for legal reasons. That was the pond we had jumped into legal stuff: a body to deal with, an estate to chop up, bills, death certificates. This was a job for her. She had a checklist to go through. 
I looked at her, and she wobbled. It was probably just the steam from the coffee.
The hospice lady talked at me for a while. I tried to listen. I nodded and sipped my coffee. Eventually, she went into the other room and started packing up tubes and pieces of equipment. She was always in the other room, rattling around. Pretty soon, there wouldn’t be anyone rattling around in the other room. It was going to get uncomfortably quiet.

I put my cup in the sink, and suddenly I was in the bathroom. I must have walked there. It didn’t matter. 
I sat on the toilet and peed. It takes me a while. I haven’t won a peeing race in thirty years. 
Three months before I turned sixty-five, and Medicare would have taken care of it, I woke up one day and couldn’t pee anymore. The stream had been a trickle for a while, but now the sphincter was jammed shut. I tried to pee fifty times that first day and squirted out three drops total. It was starting to get uncomfortable in my gut. I didn’t seek medical attention, though. I didn’t want to spend the money. I had just had a kidney stone episode a couple of months before, and it cost me $3000 to go to the emergency room and get a prescription for some opioids. 
On the third day of urine retention, I broke down and went to the emergency room. An angel inserted a catheter into me, and I squirted out a liter of pee. 
Unfortunately, urine immediately started building up again, and I had to pay for a return visit to the ER that evening. They taught me how to catheterize myself. It’s not as terrible as it sounds. 
So the doc put me on Tamsulosin and Finastride, which shrank my prostate, and within a few days, I was peeing again. 
Like I said, I won’t win any races, but I’m not in a hurry now either. Also, the drugs make my hair and beard grow out better than they ever have before in my life. They’re both still gray, but heck, most dudes my age are bald.

When I was done peeing, I stood up. The shower was right there. I probably needed one. 
I dropped my clothes in a puddle on the floor, turned on the water all the way to the left, stuck my hand in, and waited.
The next few days would be filled with waiting. When you’re dealing with the dead, what’s the hurry? Everybody is worried about seeming unseemly. There’s a decorum. Betsy never gave a fuck about decorum. Of course, making a fuss isn’t going to help either. The easiest way to get through something like this is just to go along.
The hot water made it through the pipes, and I got it adjusted correctly. I like it as hot as I can stand. 
I got in the shower, raised both arms, and got my pits wet, then turned around and drenched myself from the top down. I dumped some shampoo on my head and worked up a good lather, then grabbed a couple of handfuls of soap bubbles and rubbed them on my pits, my crotch, and my ass. Then I rinsed from the top down. It took about a minute. 
Normally, I’m done at that point, and I shut the water off and get out. Today, I leaned into the force of the water, bowed my head, and let it pound the sound from my skull. 

After a while, the hot water ran out. 

I didn’t want to put the dirty clothes back on, and I hadn’t brought in a fresh set with me. To get to the bedroom required a quick dash down the hallway, really only a few feet. It wasn’t usually a problem, but today, I didn’t want the hospice lady to catch me with no clothes on.
It doesn’t bother me for people to see me naked. I rather like it on most occasions. I think it’s wrong that in our culture, we’ve been taught to be ashamed of so many of the aspects of who we are. I didn’t want to make things uncomfortable for the hospice lady, though. 
I opened the door and peeked. She sat at the kitchen table, staring out the window and drinking more coffee. 
I probably could’ve made the dash with a towel wrapped around me, but I put my old clothes back on anyway, walked the five feet to the bedroom, closed the door, and took the clothes back off.
I stood there naked and realized how icky my skin felt. The nervous sweat of confronting death had been absorbed by my clothes and rubbed back off on me after my shower.
The only proper thing to do was put the clothes back on, gather up the necessary items, go back into the bathroom, take the clothes off, and take another shower.
Then I had to pee again. 

The hospice lady was standing when I finally got back to the kitchen. She said some sympathy stuff, gave me a stack of literature, and a list of phone numbers. She told me someone was coming to get “the body” in a couple of hours, then she gathered up the rest of her stuff and went out the front door.
I shut it behind her and pushed the wooden slab until it clicked. The refrigerator was humming and gently rocking on three legs. I hoped the compressor wasn’t getting ready to go out. That’s what kills refrigerators … compressor failure. The furnace kicked on. The floor squeaked. It wasn’t as quiet as I thought it was going to be. 
There was nothing to look at in front of me but the door. It got boring, so I reluctantly turned around. Betsy’s body was lying on the hospital bed that had been set up in the living room just two days ago. The hospice lady must have arranged her. She looked comfortable. The sheets were pulled up under her elbows and folded flat. 


I started walking over toward her, but it seemed to be taking too long. I looked down at the floorboards. Maybe I could count them. How many floorboards could there be between us? They moved as I walked. I was getting dizzy, so I quit looking at them and saw something worse: Betsy’s body. 
I pushed one of the wingback chairs over close to her, so I could reach her hand, and sat in it.
Betsy wasn’t wearing her glasses. I wondered where they were. They would be wherever she took them off for the last time. The last time. That seemed profound. It must be meaningful somehow. Never ever to happen again. The last time she woke up … not knowing it was the last time. The last time she put on her shoes. The last time she brushed her shining hair. The last time we kissed. The last time we made love.
 I couldn’t swallow. A million butterflies rose in a cloud and flapped their way from my gut into my throat and up to my eyes. I cried and spasmed. 
After that, I was quiet for a while. All the flapping wings had blown rational thought out of my brain. I was exhausted. I don’t think I slept, but after a while, I noticed it was getting light outside.
Breakfast seemed like a reasonable idea. I hadn’t really eaten anything in a couple of days.
There wasn’t a whole lot in the fridge, but Betsy always kept bacon and eggs around for me. I took three strips out, turned the heat on high to get the pan going, and tossed them in.
On the countertop, next to my hand, the small pile of literature left behind by the hospice lady caught my eye. I picked one up and looked at it, but I couldn’t read it. The writing was small and printed over a picture of a meadow with lambs. Everything swam together like Scrabble pieces being stirred before the game begins.
Bacon and eggs might not be enough. You sort of needed something to sop up the grease. I thought maybe I’d make some toast, but when I looked in the fridge, there was no bread. 
That was a disappointment.
A beam of sunlight came in the kitchen window and landed on the countertop next to my hand. The light had that golden quality it only gets on the last glorious days of summer. The beautiful day beckoned to me. I thought I’d go for a walk to the convenience store at the bottom of the hill and get some bread.



The night before, as I sat with Betsy for the last time, a hard-driving rain rolled through and pounded the last of the leaves from the trees. Now, they plastered the sidewalk in front of me. As I walked, I studied their overlapping oranges and muted browns. The heat of the almost autumn sun teased the crown of my head through the net of tree limbs. 
Something about my street was different from what I remembered. Smaller houses, maybe, and not many cars. Usually, cars filled all the on-street parking spaces. Maybe I had made a wrong turn. 
I was worrying about a blister that was forming on the heel of my right foot, when a dog that looked just like the one I had when I was a kid, ran right by me, bumping into my leg and knocking me back a step.
“Barkley?” I exclaimed.

**TL;DR:**  
[Journiv](https://journiv.com/) is a a beautiful, self-hosted, privacy-first journaling app with mood tracking, daily prompts, and meaningful insights. The mission is simple: **your memories should always stay yours.** Own them, don’t rent them.

Journiv 0.1.0-beta.8 is now live on [GitHub](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app) and fully [Docker-hostable](https://journiv.com/docs/installation).  
Start owning your thoughts and memories forever and keep them completely private.

**The Story Behind Journiv**

I got into self-hosting last year and like many here, while exploring options journaling solution, I realized there wasn’t a truly modern, self-hosted equivalent to Day One or Apple Journal. Most alternatives were either general note apps or old abandoned projects.

I wanted something focused on journaling with:

* “On This Day” memories
* Prompt-based journaling
* A clean, minimal, distraction-free writing experience
* Open format

So… I built my own: [Journiv](https://journiv.com/), a beautiful (at least I am trying to make it so), self-hosted, privacy-first journaling app with mood tracking, daily prompts, and meaningful insights. Journiv began as a deeply personal project, a way for me to capture memories, reflections, and the stories behind thousands of photos and videos of my fast-growing kids. What started as a tool for my own parenting journey has grown into something that fills a real gap in the self-hosting community.

If you’re curious, you can read the full story behind Journiv [here](https://journiv.com/blog/the-story-behind-journiv).

**Get Involved**

Give Journiv a try, share your feedback and report [issues](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app/issues). It means a lot at this stage.

**The Journey Ahead**

Journiv is in active development, with a fully functional backend, a web frontend, and mobile apps launching soon. It is self-hosted, and designed to be your companion for decades.

Journiv is being built because our memories deserve to be ours, forever.

1pbhtx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1pbhtx2/fed_up_feelings_resurfacing/,Fed up. Feelings resurfacing,"I don't know who to turn to, after some research I'm posting on this sub. I'm pretty sure it's limerance but I can't be sure without anyone to talk to. 

I [37 M] have an intense emotional connection going all the way back to highschool with 'Emma' [36 F] . We would stay up all night messaging and talking, until life got in the way and we moved to different universities at age 18. 

10 years passed and I still thought about her fondly, I'd check in on social media every now and then she was still as beautiful as I remembered and saw she had settled down and had a young daughter. It was bittersweet. 

One day I was scrolling (sometimes in 2017) through the dating apps and saw her on there, my heart started racing. I messaged Emma on social media and asked if she was single now and she was. We started talking like we were 18 again and how we'd always thought of each other but life never gave us a window. 

We started hooking up and it was the most physically intense experience I've ever had with anyone, coupled with the intellectual stimulation it was breathtaking. 

Things broke down after 3 or 4 months. Her daughter had to take priority which I totally get, I was scared to really go 'all in' as I didn't imagine being a step parent. After manning up and some reflection I confessed my love for her but by this time it was too late, I think she was checked out. I sent 30 white roses to her on her birthday and we chatted for a bit but I could tell things were not the same, I was heartbroken. I couldn't bear the thought of her with anyone else so I removed her from all social media. I deleted Facebook etc. Blocked number etc. 

I started dating again (I probably wasn't ready tbh) met a great girl, relocated got a house, dream job, pets. But the thoughts of Emma still lingerd I repressed them as far as I could. 

Until one day I got a message on Instagram this year (in my requests inbox) from Emma, saying she still thinks of me fondly and holds no hard feelings to me. I was flooded and a mess, I left it a few days and replied with something along the lines of ' I think of you fondly too, hope you are happy' .... This is when my feelings started to bubble again, I started having dreams about her I couldn't take it anymore so I messaged her saying I dream about her. She told me the same. 

I asked her if there was ever a chance for us and she says it's something she thinks about often and wants to meet me to explain she owes me a explanation of how she left me. 

I struggled and was a mess in this time, my life was perfect on the surface but it wasn't the life with Emma, after some thinking I decided to meet her at a coffee shop after work (I was riddled with guilt about keeping this from my current partner) the excuse I told myself was that this was to tie up a loose end that's been eating away at me and to give myself closure. 

As soon as a saw Emma my soul was set alight. We hugged and chatted, she told me how she'd been with someone who'd hurt her more than anyone ever could. It was like a dagger to the gut, the thought that she'd been with someone else when I natively told myself she was focusing on her daughter. But she said it was all a mistake and shed been carrying me around in her heart all this time. She told me she did love me and I loved her. 

We spent about 2 hours taking about things, how I was in a relationship etc. We hugged and parted ways. 

On the drive home I was ready to torpedo my whole life for Emma. I had told myself I was going to break up with my current GF. Emma messaged and said she can't be responsible for ending my current relationship and wishes things were different. I was heartbroken again, the only reason I would leave would be for her so it was an impossible choice. 

I poured my heart out into one final message and tried to say my final goodbye.

I've been really proud as I've not looked at her Instagram or googled her name for around 6 months now but I'm having thoughts about reaching out again. My feelings are starting to bubble. 

I'm sorry if this is an incorrect rant I just needed to vent.

She’s big on anything bourbon-based, so I wandered over to the spirits section to grab a bottle of Bulleit for her too.  
  
As I’m standing there with it in my hand, this older gentleman next to me looks over and goes, “I wouldn’t get that one it’s good, but it runs sweeter than you think.” Then he starts recommending something completely different, like we’ve known each other for years. He pointed me toward a bottle of Four Roses and basically gave me a TED Talk on why it’s his go-to. It wasn’t rude or anything god no, more like the overly friendly, confident Costco alcohol aisle energy that only happens when people feel passionately about what you’re holding. So I ended up grabbing both, honestly. One for her and one because curiosity won. Tried it later and honestly? Shoutout to uncle, he wasn’t wrong.

1pbhndj,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1pbhndj/we_built_a_rustbased_network_metadata_probe_that/,We built a Rust-based network metadata probe that beats Zeek/Suricata in small/edge environments — should we open-source it?,"Hi all,

Beware, beware, this is a long post with a big ask. But I guess.. for network nuts like you, that shouldn't be a problem ;-)

Small context: I’m part of a small team working in network visibility / security. For years, the other devs and myself, we’ve lived with and used the usual stack: Zeek/Suricata + homegrown glue + DB + dashboards + etc... (of the flavor of the month)

It works (I mean, Meta is using Zeek and Suricata, so yeah, it definitely works), but at the time we kept running into the same wall in a few places (edge boxes, noisy OT/telco environments, MSP-style multi-tenant deployments, drops of bandwitdh, etc...). At some point we stopped trying to patch more stuff onto Zeek or Suricata and we built our own internal probe.

Now, we’re trying to decide **how much of it (if any) should be open-sourced**, and I’d really like to sanity-check that with people who actually run this kind of thing in other environment than ours.

**What this thing does, in layman terms**

Very short version (might be useless for anyone here who already use network dpi probes):

* It sits on a link, captures packets and turns them into enriched metadata / DB-ready records (flows, protocols, specific network metadata, assets, etc.).
* At around **1 Gbit/s of sustained line rate**, we’re currently in the ballpark of → roughly **\~10 Mbit/s of metadata** sent to the DB, which translates into about **\~1 Mbit/s stored on disk after compression** (Numbers are still being tuned, but that’s the order of magnitude).
* Internal testing, but also commercial ones (we got to test it with Spirent), shows a no-false detection at 100Gbit/s for 135+ network protocols (from layer 2 to layer 7) and for nearly 4000+ applications on **commodity** hardware (no FPGA, no ASIC, no nothing. Just good old CPU and RAM).
* For the knowledgeable guys out there, we are not using DPDK, because it works bad with Rust. That and DPDK datasheets are sketchy. For high-speed bandwidth, we even decided (probably when we were drunk, who knows?) to redevelop our own NIC drivers (also in Rust because it was fun and we are addicted to pain or something...). For small full line-rate link (with full protocol analysis), we are a magnitude lower in resource need to make it run than Zeek or Suricata. I have benchmark if you want to get technical later.

Our design goals were pretty simple, but in hindsight... a bit crazy:

* **Low footprint, to make it run “where Zeek/Suricata hurt” (our CTO's word, not mine):** on-premise, VMs, small Kubernetes nodes, cloud workloads, small ARM or x86 boxes alike (thanks to Rust), etc...
* **Simple deployment:** one static Rust binary, no dynamic deps. Drop it on a recent Linux, point it to an interface, it starts capturing. There’s an installer with a CLI mode so it can be wired into Ansible / automation. Optional dockerized DB pipeline if you want ClickHouse/Postgres ready to go.
* **Meant for fleet use:** hundreds / thousands of probes in an MSP / distributed environment.
* **Outputs:** JSON over HTTP / REST API, plus structured schemas for ClickHouse/Postgres so you can plug your own analytics, detections, or reporting on top.
* **Implementation:** full Rust codebase (I mean FULL RUST CODEBASE, no cheating), with a focus on predictability and safety rather than pseudo-clever packet hacks that are lowering visibility and the quality of the telemetry.

**Why we didn’t just stick with Zeek/Suricata**

For those who might ask, internally the pain points that pushed us to build this were roughly:

* We needed the analytic depth that Zeek promised and that we couldn't get with netflow/SNMP and the likes.
* But resource footprint were too high when we tried to tuck probes directly on Kubernetes worker nodes / small cloud instances / ARM edge devices. It's ended up being too big and defeated the point. Also, we wanted the exact same probe if we wanted to monitor very high-speed bandwidth, but with commodity hardware, too.
* We wanted something we could deploy and operate as a fleet in a multi-tenant context (MSP / MSSP style).
* We needed better control over metadata shape and volume**,** so DB/storage doesn’t explode in noisy environments. I mean, the last time I deployed Zeek, in two days I had filled Elastic and I had to scratch that VM. Not enough space.

This isn’t meant as “Zeek bad, our thing good” – more “we had a slightly different set of constraints and ended up building a different tool”. And now... we are curious to see if someone would need it or not.

**Okay, here is the crux of it, now. The part where we would need help with: open source or... something else?**

Inside the team we’re arguing about what is actually useful to open-source for people like you, versus what should remain “product” (if anything) - Because we haven't open-sourced anything yet as a company (though the direction is willing to do it if we can convince them).

Rough options we’re debating:

* Open-source the **probe engine + protocol parsers**, so you can run and extend it yourself, and build services/UX around it.
* Open-source mainly the **DB schemas / ingestion pipeline / tooling**, and keep the probe itself closed.
* Or keep the whole thing closed and only offer it as **self-hosted / appliance / cloud**.

**What I’d really like your feedback on:**

1. Does this fill a real gap for you, or is your current setup “good enough”? If you’ve deployed Zeek/Suricata/NTOP/etc. in anger, would you even bother looking at something like this?
2. If some part of it were open-sourced, what would actually be useful to you?
   * The core probe and parsers?
   * The schemas / ingestion pipeline?
   * SDKs / libraries to embed in your own stuff?
   * Something else entirely?
3. License / model concerns: Any licenses that are an immediate “no” for you (AGPL, etc.)? Would you be OK with “core open-source, extra features/commercial on top”, or is that a non-starter in your world?
4. How you’d realistically consume it: In your environment, would you be more likely to:
   * run it as a **self-hosted binary** on your own infra,
   * deploy some sort of **appliance**,
   * or use a **managed service** that just ships you metadata/alerts?
5. Anything that would make you run away immediately? For example: too much resource usage, awkward integration, unclear security model, weird license, no story for long-term maintenance, etc.

This is not a beta-signup post or a stealth sales thing; we’re not dropping links or asking for DMs (well, if you want to, let's. I have time for Zoom-coffee, like the good millenial I am). I’m mostly trying to avoid spending months open-sourcing the wrong bits, or in the wrong way, for the people who might actually care.

If you’re the kind of person who has fought with network telemetry in production, I’d really like to hear “this would be useful *if* X/Y/Z” or “honestly, we wouldn’t bother, because…”.

If you’ve ever spent 20 minutes tweaking knobs only to watch your first layer peel off like a bad sunburn, you get it. So when I heard the **FLASHFORGE Adventurer 5M** boasts *fully automatic bed leveling*, I’ll admit—I perked up like my cat hearing the treat bag rustle. And honestly? It might just be the smoothest, fastest, most headache-free 3D printer I’ve tested lately.

Want to know why this little powerhouse has me grinning like I just printed a perfect calibration cube on the first try? Stick around—because I’ve been tinkering with it for weeks, and **there’s a lot to love** (and a few quirks to watch out for).

# One-Click Printing That Actually Works (No, Really!)

Remember when “plug-and-play” meant you still needed a PhD in firmware? Yeah, those days might finally be over. The **Adventurer 5M’s automatic bed leveling** isn’t just marketing fluff. You literally tap “start,” and it scans the entire bed, adjusts on the fly, and lays down a first layer that *sticks*. Like, **actually sticks**—no warping, no elephant’s foot, no existential crisis before breakfast.

Ever printed something only to find it’s halfway across the build plate like it tried to escape? Not here. The **precision sensors** map the surface so accurately that even my warped glass bed (thanks, clumsy me!) doesn’t throw it off.

And FYI: if your idea of a good Saturday involves printing six cookie cutters for your keto baking channel (no judgment—wait, that’s me), this saves you *hours*.

**Key auto-leveling perks**:

* **No manual adjustments**—seriously, zero screw-turning
* **Consistent first-layer adhesion**, even with tricky filaments like PETG
* **Saves filament and time** by avoiding failed prints from the get-go

Oh, and here’s a sweet deal if you’re already sold: [grab the FLASHFORGE Adventurer 5M on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3M86r4Y).

# Speed Demon with a Brain? Meet the 12X Ultra-Fast Engine

Let’s talk speed—because **600mm/s travel speed** isn’t just a number on a spec sheet. This thing *moves*. I swapped from my old Ender 3 (bless its slow, reliable heart) to the Adventurer 5M and printed the same Benchy in **under 35 minutes**. My jaw dropped.

How? It’s all thanks to the **CoreXY motion system** and insane **20,000mm/s² acceleration**. Translation: it zips around like it’s late for a coffee date, but without the wobbles or layer shifts you’d expect at that pace. FlashForge baked in **vibration compensation algorithms**, so even high-speed prints stay crisp.

But here’s the real question: *does speed ruin quality?* IMO, **not at all**—especially with the dual-fan cooling and direct drive extruder working in harmony. Tiny overhangs? Clean. Sharp corners? Nailed it. It’s like the printer knows you’re watching and refuses to embarrass itself. :)

# Smart Design Touches That Feel Like Magic

FlashForge clearly asked real users, “What drives you nuts?” and then fixed it.

Take the **3-second nozzle swap**. Three. Seconds. No hex keys, no burned fingers, no 15-minute YouTube tutorial. Just twist, pull, click—done. I switched from a 0.4mm to a 0.8mm nozzle mid-week to crank out some big vases, and it felt like cheating.

And the **dual-sided PEI spring steel bed**? Game changer. One side’s textured for grip (perfect for PLA), the other smooth for glossy finishes (hello, resin-like ABS look). Pop it off, flex it, and your print pops right off—no scraping, no swearing.

Oh, and it **heats to 200°C in 35 seconds**. That’s faster than my microwave reheats coffee. If you’re batch-printing or testing settings, this alone saves you *hours per week*.

**Smart features I didn’t know I needed**:

* **High-flow 32mm³/s nozzle** = faster material throughput without clogs
* **280°C direct extruder** handles everything from PLA to flexible TPU
* **Multiple nozzle sizes (0.25–0.8mm)** for fine details or rapid drafts

# Remote Monitoring That Actually Works (Unlike My “Smart” Toaster)

Confession: I once left a 12-hour print running… and spent the whole time refreshing my phone like a weirdo, just in case it failed. With the **FlashPrint app**, that paranoia’s gone.

The **built-in camera + Wi-Fi** lets you monitor prints in real time from your couch, your car, or your keto bakery kitchen (multitasking queen, anyone?). You can pause, resume, or even upload new files remotely. Plus, if something *does* go sideways, you’ll get an alert—so you’re not wasting $20 of silk filament on a spaghetti monster.

And no, it’s not some janky third-party hack. It’s baked into FlashForge’s **Flash Maker ecosystem**, and it’s surprisingly smooth. Even my tech-averse brother figured it out in five minutes.

# Maintenance? Yeah, It’s Still a Machine (But Not a Nightmare)

Look, no 3D printer is *totally* maintenance-free—unless you count the one in my dreams that runs on hopes and good vibes. But the Adventurer 5M keeps upkeep **ridiculously simple**.

* **Clean the nozzle** monthly with a brass brush (or every 50 hours, whichever comes first)
* **Wipe the PEI bed** with isopropyl alcohol if prints start slipping
* **Check belt tension** every few weeks—but honestly, the CoreXY design stays taut

And FlashForge includes a **solid FAQ + troubleshooting guide** with actual solutions, not just “turn it off and on again.” (Though, let’s be real—that *does* fix half my problems… :/)

If you run into issues, their community forums are active, and customer support actually replies. Wild, right?

# Final Verdict: Worth the Hype?

So—should you grab the FLASHFORGE Adventurer 5M?

If you’re tired of babysitting your printer, wasting filament on failed first layers, or waiting *forever* for prints to finish, **this machine is a legit upgrade**. It’s fast, it’s smart, and that **fully automatic bed leveling**? Absolute gold.

Is it perfect? Well… it’s priced higher than entry-level printers, sure. But when you factor in the **time saved**, **reduced waste**, and **sheer reliability**, it pays for itself—especially if you’re prototyping, selling prints, or just hate wasting weekends on printer drama.

Ever thought your 3D printing life could feel this… effortless? Maybe it’s time to stop leveling beds like it’s 2018.

My question for you all, if I know I need to adjust my eating time frame due to work or family commitments, like Thanksgiving, would I be correct in assuming that I should shorten my eating window, or lengthen my fast to adjust when I eat?

  
I guess the question is, does it really matter when my eating window is as long as I'm hitting at least the 18hr fast?

I'm the oldest in age of the staff and most of the staff goes to high school or college. now, since this girl (17f) started she has done nothing but feed drama and spread negative comments about me to other coworkers. for more clarity here. I started as a regular employee at minimum wage, then got promoted to manager in less than 2months. im a quiet person and I don't  have many friends and don't really try to make new ones as I have autism and  BPD (borderline personality disorder)and people usually use that against me in many ways, this helps me be more aware of what is happening around me. now on to what is being said. I find it disturbing so please... 

first... its being said to customers too that I got my position by ""sucking d\*\*\*"" idk who's since Im married and I respect myself... its also been said that I am a bully and im picking on her when I barely speak. she has told a different coworker what I speak of her personal family situation when I don't know her personally. also lying to her family and our bosses saying I don't help them when they ask when I do help and do the most as a manager... also now other employees are speaking ill of me when I barely even work with them at all... 

she has spread rumors about me and other new hires and has caused all types of drama plus I have my suspicions as to when she does tips and exchanges the coins for bills she might be stealing from the registers to take home more... I can't confirm my suspicions with video evidence but it was brought to me as a concern by 2 new hires and because I almost caught her once and never really saw her do it myself fully.

spanish is my native language so sorry for the grammatical errors that there may be.

I hope potato queen reads this and gives feedback even if it isn't in a video. I just don't know how to process all of this but if anyone has questions I'll be glad to answer as best I can. ",1,1764607202.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

[Sage/Breville Bambino Plus],"I'm pretty new to the hobby, according to the fact, that the breville/sage bambino plus (an sage/bambino the dose control pro grinder) is my first proper espresso machine. In the beginning everything was fine, totally enjoyable coffes, but since about 3 month I just manage to make sour espresso.

I tried pretty much anything...tried to improve my puck prep, different ratios, different beans, different baskets, different pre-infusion, all of the grind sizes my grinder has to offer, different pressures, pre-heating the machine with 1 blank shot or pre-heating with the steamwand. And so on...I looked at countless reddit posts, videos, searched the internet for help. But nothing helped.

Most of the time the answer is grind finer, but at some point my machine just dripped a few drops and they were also sour. I tried adjusting from a way too fast flow rate (with spraying) to just dripping...and you guessed it all of them were sour.

My preparations looks like...

1. make a blank shot to warm warm up
2. dose 18g of coffe into the double basket, that comes with the machine
3. tap a few times on the table, so everything fits in the basket
4. level the ground with a wdt tool, but just on the top, because mine has some pretty thick needles, tap again
5. level with a level tool and tamp
6. mostly use the standard preinfusion time (because it's sour both ways)
7. 1:2 ration, about 25-30 seconds, about 36g coffe

You've probably wondered whether a body exfoliation brush or a natural scrub works better. Both methods can help remove dead skin cells, but they work differently and give different results.

**What's the Difference?**

A body exfoliation brush uses bristles to physically sweep away dead skin. You can use it dry or in the shower, and it gets deep into your pores without needing extra products. Natural scrubs, on the other hand, use ingredients like sugar, salt, or coffee grounds mixed with oils to slough off dead skin.

**Why Choose a Body Exfoliation Brush?**

Brushes are reusable and last way longer than scrubs. You don't need to keep buying new products every month. They're also less messy – no grainy bits clogging your drain or making your shower floor slippery.

The bristles on an exfoliating brush can reach your back and other hard-to-reach spots more easily. Plus, dry brushing before your shower can help improve circulation and leave your skin looking more awake.

If you're ready to try one, check out some quality options here: https://athomewave.com/body-exfoliation-brush

**What About Natural Scrubs?**

Natural body scrubs feel luxurious and often smell amazing. They moisturize while they exfoliate because of the oils mixed in. If you have super sensitive skin, you can control how gentle or rough the scrub is by adjusting your pressure.

The downside? They're messier, more expensive over time, and can harbor bacteria if not stored properly.

**Which One Should You Pick?**

If you want something budget-friendly, long-lasting, and effective for daily use, an exfoliating body brush is your best bet. It works great for most skin types and doesn't require buying refills.

Natural scrubs work better if you want a spa-like experience once or twice a week, or if you need extra moisture while exfoliating.

**The Bottom Line**

Both methods remove dead skin and improve texture, but brushes win for convenience and value. They're simple to use, easy to clean, and deliver consistent results without the mess.

The best decision I ever made honestly, I sleep like a baby now and my anxiety is basically gone.

But the one thing I wasn't prepared for was how much I used caffeine to manage my appetite. I would have coffee at 3pm and it would kill my hunger until dinner, then another cup after dinner to suppress evening snacking. Now without caffeine my evenings are just constant hunger and cravings. I eat a normal dinner but by 8pm i'm raiding the pantry for chips or whatever i can find. It's frustrating because I'm finally sleeping well and feeling calm but I've gained 14 pounds since quitting.

I tried herbal tea and it does almost nothing. I tried eating more protein at dinner but the cravings come anyway. The hunger feels almost worse than it did before I quit caffeine, like my body is making up for years of being artificially suppressed. I’ve looked into appetite suppressants but all of them either contain caffeine or are based on some random herbs that don’t have any studies backing them so probably scams.

1pbhila,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1pbhila/why_does_a_unchanging_church_change_every_time/,Why does a “unchanging” church change every time society does?,"The LDS Church claims to be “unchanging,” “restored,” and “exactly as Jesus organized it,” yet almost every major policy shift in its history has been a direct response to societal pressure, not divine revelation.

Just look at the pattern:

- Early church leaders regularly drank beer, wine, and whiskey.
Joseph Smith and Brigham Young both had bars in their homes and regularly consumed alcohol. It only became a “revelation” when temperance movements swept the U.S. and alcohol use became socially frowned on. Then suddenly the Word of Wisdom became a salvation issue (remember the crazy conference talk about the woman who gave up her salvation over one tiny sip of coffee).

- Polygamy wasn’t “God’s higher law.”
It perfectly fit the needs of a frontier religious hierarchy:
	1.	Satisfy the sexual desires of powerful (and disgusting) male leaders.
	2.	Rapidly increase the population of the church, therefore more child labor, more tithing, more control.
Then, when the federal government squeezed Utah with the Edmunds Act and threatened to confiscate everything, God “revealed” that polygamy must end.

- Early Utah economics were… shady.
The church survived off secret mining deals, questionable business practices, and a long list of things they’d excommunicate people for today. The federal government absolutely had reason to be suspicious.

- When the church was broke in the early 1900s, God suddenly cared deeply about tithing compliance. Once again, perfect timing with zero coincidence.

- 1978: Blacks “given” the priesthood.
This wasn’t God finally catching up—it was the church cornered by the Civil Rights movement, universities threatening to ban BYU, protests, and enormous political pressure. When keeping the ban became too costly, suddenly a revelation appeared.

- Women’s garments updated in 2025.
Why? Not because “God updated His eternal patterns,” but because women were sick of wearing bulky, outdated, uncomfortable clothes. Market pressure, social pressure, and member frustration forced the church’s hand. Two-piece swimming suits - I know that changed somewhere along the way … not sure when God decided they were ok.

- Mission age changed from 19 to 18 (boys) and from 21 to 19 (girls).
Why? Not revelation—retention. Too many young men were going to college, growing up, developing independence, and losing interest in missionary work. Lower the age, reduce the thinking time (increase the ability of parents to pressure their kids while still in high school), and increase the numbers.

- It wasn’t until 2013 that a woman was asked to give a prayer in General Conference

- LGBTQ Flip flop.  2015: The church issues the “November Policy,” labeling same-sex married couples as apostates and banning their kids from baptism.  PUBLIC OUTRAGE → massive resignations. Then in 2019: Church reverses the policy and says it was all a misunderstanding.

Thousands had already left.

This is perhaps the clearest example of “policy by public pressure.”

- One other that I will mention that is personal for me - when I was a kid the church preached that interracial marriage was a sin. The idea of even dating a non-white (being Caucasian myself) was very frowned upon. My wife is Mexican and I couldn’t be more grateful and in love.

- OK now for the funniest one of all for me - CAFFEINE!  Remember the old days of caffeine-free coke. Being looked at as a bad kid if you had a coke in your hand (God forbid a cup of coffee). Being forced to drink root beer and sprite. I have to share a crazy story on this. In recent years I was part of a company that moved its corporate headquarters to a new building. Many of the complexities of this move fell under my responsibility. Our CEO was surprised to see coffee machines (Keurig) in the break rooms - saying “I didn’t authorize coffee machines and I don’t want to have a work environment that drives the spirit away.”  You want to know why I was flabbergasted by this?  This same CEO had to drink 4-6 Red Bulls every day just to function!  The hypocrisy and lunacy!  

Here is the consistent theme:

Whenever society changes, the church miraculously discovers new revelation.

But the church also loves to quote Hebrews 13:8:

“Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.”

And they preach that the restored church is “unchanging,” implying that doctrine never shifts.

But it shifts constantly.

So that brings me to the real question I wrestled with before leaving:

Are these changes really coming from God—
or from a desperate institution trying to keep members (and their tithing) from walking out the door?

Because to me, it’s obvious:

If God were directing this church, He wouldn’t need to wait for social pressure, financial crisis, federal law, or public outrage to reveal the “right” thing.

But the church always waits.

Every. Single. Time.

And that absolutely crystal clear pattern was ultimately my deal-breaker. How did I figure all this out? I started actually relying on common sense instead of attaching myself to blind faith and brainwashing.

What others did I miss? - surely there are many more examples …


My religion: Live a good life. Be good to others. Love my family unconditionally. Be grateful for all the good in life. BE HAPPY!

1pbhij8,https://www.reddit.com/r/novationcircuit/comments/1pbhij8/circuit_rhythm_camping_sessions/,Circuit Rhythm camping sessions,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my workflow and the whole vibe behind my outdoor beatmaking sessions.

I’ve always loved nature, camping, and sample-based hip-hop. A few months ago I picked up a Novation Circuit Rhythm and a wireless speaker, and that finally pushed me to start something I’d been thinking about for years: launching my own YouTube channel focused on outdoor beat sessions.

Most of the time I head out to a quiet spot in nature near my town. Nothing too far; just places with trees, a dried creek, a hill, or a small open forest patch. I set up my gear, brew some coffee on my gas stove, and start building a beat right there. I film the whole thing, usually grab a drone shot or two, and then I pack everything up after about three hours so I can get home and rush off to work.

Then comes the editing part; days of cutting the footage, syncing everything, grading the shots, and shaping the session into something calm, warm, and nature-focused. I usually upload on Mondays.

I also try to say a few words in English in each video. English isn’t my native language, so I do my best, sometimes struggling with pronunciation, but I see it as part of the process. It still feels strange to talk to the camera, but it’s a humble beginning and I’m learning as I go.

Honestly, I enjoy every part of this workflow: the nature, the coffee ritual, the beatmaking, the filming, and the editing. I’m trying to show that joy in the videos themselves.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1pbhgh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1pbhgh6/always_ask_for_clarification_when_needed/,Always Ask for Clarification When Needed,"Just a quick rant into the void about a recent personal mishap with a job interview:

To preface this I will start by saying I already have a job opportunity I’m extremely grateful to have and accepted, but I was simultaneously going through two separate interview rounds at two different companies— this is normal as we never know if we’ll get a job offer or if an opportunity will fall through.

Even though I was happy with the first company and onboarded, both opportunities took around 2 months each, the first just happened to be slightly faster to complete and they needed a quick response as the start date was sooner than I expected.

Since I had already dedicated so much time to the second company as well and went through several rounds of interviews, I decided that I might as well attend the final interview for it, because why wouldn’t I? 

The interview was scheduled just before thanksgiving, I was off at my current new job this week so I was available to make it. I had a zoom meeting scheduled for 10:30AM.

The night *before* this interview at around 7pm, I received a call from the person at HR at this second company to remind me: “Hello so and so, please be 5 minutes early into the call in case of technical issues… [etc]… your interview is at 1PM”

1pm? The zoom meeting has 10:30AM - 11:30AM designated, but surely this person wouldn’t call me this late with an updated time I shouldn’t follow. I’ll use the same zoom link and just show up at 1pm.

I sleep in a little, make my coffee, go do some laundry downstairs in my apartment complex, fold laundry, shower, getting suited up for the interview, and I check my phone to make sure I’m doing OK on time— 4 missed calls.

Urgently check the voicemail, “Hello so and so we’re in the zoom meeting waiting for you, not sure why you’re not here [etc], we will have to reschedule for later today”

I call back immediately, no answer. Get a callback 2 hours later, and I explain that I was told a different time for the interview last night from someone at HR. He apologized for the mix-up and asked if I could attend a rescheduled interview on Friday morning, and he would send a new zoom meeting invite and call me as well. I said of course, went our separate ways. 

Fast forward, Thursday night now, going to bed with a belly full of Turkey, realize I have no zoom link for tomorrow. Friday morning, Tried to reach this person and the person from HR, no response, OOO. 

Monday comes along, receive an email in the morning along the likes of: “We will be sending job offers throughout the day, thank you to all 50~ applicants who made it this far, and we wish you luck on your future endeavors if you do not receive one”

There’s no way I’m getting a job offer, because I never interviewed. I emailed back and basically communicated the corporate version of “Dude, what the fuck”, and they stated they were not able to reschedule, and it seems due to time zone issues my zoom meeting was sent with the incorrect time. I responded with, again, the formal equivalent of “No, you called me with the wrong time for no reason whatsoever, and then never called me back after I missed it to reschedule even though you said you would. If you had never called to remind me with an incorrect time I would have been at the interview as I intended at 10:30AM”.

And that was basically it, there was brief back and forth for 2-3 emails, where I basically just wanted them to admit their oversight and miscommunication. They did and I was happy— again, luckily, I already had an opportunity secured, but there really are assholes out there making errors that could affect other’s livelihoods. 

Moral of the story, if something feels off, ask for clarification, don’t blindly follow conflicting instructions and hope for the best… I admit they’re not solely responsible, and I should have clarified between conflicting meeting time @10:30AM and verbally communicated time @ 1PM

TLDR: Someone from HR told me the night before the final interview that it would be @ 1PM, but the zoom meeting was scheduled on my calendar for 10:30AM. I showed up at 1PM and no one was there, and I didn’t get a reschedule. Luckily I had another opportunity I accepted and onboarded for already.",2,1764606885.0,interviews,6,0.75,False

I’m 27 and feel like I’ve spent most of my life trying to be as palatable to people as possible, and by now it just feels like I’ve fucked myself by turning into a non-person. I don’t know how to ask people for help because a) I don’t know what I want most of the time, b) if I do know, then I have been disappointed enough times to where it’s usually just better to do it myself if I want it done properly, and c) I feel like if I’m asking people for help then I’m being a burden, which is basically akin to a fate worse than death for me.
I’m struggling with feeling isolated and like I’m trying to draw water from a dry well in terms of everyday life, and have been for a long time. The worst part is that my life is pretty damn good, I have a well-paying job that I enjoy, a family that loves me, a cat I love very much, and a few close friends, so it doesn’t feel like I can complain. My friends are going through a lot worse with just being in a myriad of stressful situations and life/health issues, so I feel like me complaining that I’m feeling sad is just trying to pretend that I’m having near as bad of a time. I don’t really want to involve my family in my personal life due to some past issues that resulted in me being outed to my family as a lesbian thanks to my former best friend as a teenager (who abandoned me afterwards, but that’s neither here nor there). I think talking about it now they’d be fine, but it’s a point of anxiety for me. 
Regardless, it’s been something of a losing battle trying to get my friends’ attention, especially over the past year. They’re all online in different parts of the world and working adults/students, so I know realistically I can’t expect much, but I wish I could just ask them to make more of an effort. My birthday was a few weeks ago and the only one who remembered of 4 was my best friend, two of them were very apologetic and I told them I didn’t really mind (and I really don’t, my birthdays aren’t usually that exciting), but it’s more the feeling where I see them planning things for their birthdays/their spouses’ birthdays (and I’m well aware that me being their friend is a far cry from a spouse, I’m not going to posture myself that highly) and I wish someone would do the same, or at least something as minimal as like, trying to get everyone together to play games given my birthday was the day they are all usually off work. 
One of my friends who I thought I was close with has been slipping away too. We used to talk quite a bit and I was more willing to be open with them, but they seem to have shifted their priorities to another person. I’ve met them and we’re friendly, I think. I tried for months to get them to commit to a playthrough of BG3, for one, given they have hundreds of hours in the game and I’d frequently see them get off a game we were playing to go join their other friend to play it. We ended up playing a single session maybe twice over the past year despite me asking numerous times for a playthrough. I just stopped asking at a certain point given it just wasn’t going to happen. I almost always have to ask to join them for games as well, which just makes me feel like I’m constantly intruding. I have asked for help with getting involved with things with them and kind of get rebuffed, most recently was a week ago and I decided I wouldn’t message them again unless they messaged me about anything. They have not. 
“That sounds kind of ass, why don’t you get new friends?” That’s what my therapist said, but the problem is that I’m 27, out of school, work in an office where besides one of my coworkers everyone is at a minimum 10 years older, and all of my hobbies have absolutely terrible fanbases. I have bad enough social anxiety to where it’s hard to meet people and then I get to talking to people and I don’t understand how to make the push from ‘acquaintance that I talk to about (specific interest)’ to an actual friend, probably another case of my inability to do anything besides be the most sanitized version of myself. I don’t know how I made friends in the past at this point. 
That couples with my very tragic attempts at dating recently. Again, lesbian, so the scenes really aren’t great in most places and most lesbians are ass at being forward with people, but I’m one of the few that’ll actually go first… which has resulted in me ultimately feeling hurt numerous times because I very badly just want to feel wanted at some point, and not like I’m just betting on there being something there. Hinge has been incredibly unsuccessful with the few matches I’ve gotten where they do anything besides just like a photo (too non-committal, I really don’t want to feel like I always have to start a conversation) going absolutely nowhere. The one girl I’ve gotten to talk to me basically breezed past any of my attempts to ask her to get coffee and we have been in a stalemate of just asking about interests for like a month, during which time she also just ghosted me for a week and a half. 
Meanwhile I’m watching my sister get engaged to a really cool guy who loves her, attended a cousin’s wedding earlier this year, and almost all of my friends are engaged to excellent people. It feels really isolating and at this point I have to wonder what’s wrong with me. 
I’m not blaming others for my own downfalls, I don’t want to approach it like ‘actually I’m super cool and deserve to get laid and everyone is just wrong’; I’m going for the most neurotic demographic of people and just will probably have to commit to ‘going first’ again if I actually want anything to happen. I just don’t know how to really go from making comments on pictures to like, actually expressing interest without feeling like I’m being a sex pest. Once again, an issue of forcing myself to be unfailingly respectful of any possible boundaries kind of hollows out any potential for expressing attraction.
Basically, I don’t know how to just ask people to care. I put a lot of work into trying to make people feel heard and included in everything, and the payoff for that is wishing people would do the same for me. If people have problems with the way I’m doing things, then I wish they would just tell me! I’m more than happy to accept criticism because that means I can do things better, and I do ask for it and don’t usually get much back if anything.

I'm trying to hold onto my sanity in a world where sanity might be a luxury we can't afford much longer. The Special Investigations Unit denies my backup request with the kind of bureaucratic efficiency that would make any human agency proud. The response is cold, clinical: Return.

But Seer Alen sits in custody, and I know in my bones he's not the killer. Nine hundred million Aeternans go about their daily lives under six eternal suns, unaware that they have 847 days left before their world literally changes everything they know about existence.

That's 900 million people about to experience a species-wide psychotic break, and the powers that be want them ignorant.

My next lead brings me to Chancellor Thex, Aeterna's senior administrator. The way the other Aeternans speak about her, she carries herself with the kind of authority that commands respect even from their naturally contemplative species. When I arrive at the Planetary Administrative Center, a massive structure that seems to breathe with golden light flowing through its translucent walls.

Chancellor Thex is different from the others. Where they move with characteristic sloth-like deliberation, she cuts through her own bureaucracy like a blade. Her fur is darker, almost black, and her movements, while still bearing that alien grace, carry an urgency I've rarely seen in her people. When she receives me in her office, she's already reviewing what appears to be coroner's reports, her three-fingered hands moving across the data pad with practiced efficiency.

""Detective Dibble,"" she says, her voice carrying the same melodic quality as the others but with sharper edges. ""I understand you have questions about our handling of Sky Studier Ris's case.""

""Among other things."" I study her face, noting how her large dark eyes seem to hold depths that the others' don't. ""Six hours, Chancellor. That's how long it took you to rule Sky Studier Ris's death a suicide. Six hours to review a case that would take any human coroner days to properly process.""

She sets down the data pad with deliberate care. ""Our medical protocols are... streamlined compared to your species' practices. We process information efficiently.""

“Oh—uh, about that, the whole thing with Ris?

I was just sittin’ there this morning, havin’ my coffee. Well, actually, it was more like the third cup and it hit me: you signed off on that suicide ruling awfully fast. Real fast.

Funny thing is—Ris? He didn’t strike me as the attention type. More the quiet, careful kind. The kind who checks his sources twice.

So… I gotta wonder… was it really about keeping the public calm?

Or was it about keepin’ something else quiet?”

For a moment, something flickers across her features, not emotion exactly, but perhaps what passes for regret in her species. ""Detective, I am trying to give my people sixty-three more days of normalcy. Sixty-three days where children play in the golden light and adults rest without nightmares. If that makes me a monster, I accept that burden.""

""The public has a right to know—""

""The public will tear itself apart!"" She stands, her movements sudden and fierce in a way that seems almost... human. ""You don't understand our psychology, Detective. We are not like your species. We cannot compartmentalize existential terror the way humans do. We cannot find meaning in darkness because for us, darkness doesn't just mean sleep or rest, it means the end of everything we are.""

I feel something cold settling in my stomach. ""What are you talking about?""

She moves to the window, gazing out at the eternal golden landscape of her world. ""Every Aeternan child learns this in school: 'The shadow is death incarnate, the absence of everything that makes us alive.' You have words for darkness as 'sleep,' 'rest,' 'the mystery that makes life precious.' We have one word, and it means both shadow and death and the end of existence itself.""

Her large eyes meet mine, and I see something there that chills me more than anything I've encountered so far. ""If word spreads about this eclipse, Detective, if the panic sets in... we won't wait 847 days. We'll die tonight. Every child in their chambers, every adult in their homes. Mass suicide to avoid the terror of the approaching shadow.""

I process this, understanding finally why someone would kill to keep this secret. ""But Sky Studier Ris calculated—""

""Sky Studier Ris calculated that they might die anyway. But it would be in terror instead of peace."" Her voice drops to barely above a whisper. ""I gave them ignorance. It's the only kindness left.""

But even as she speaks these words, I can see something else in her expression. Fear. Real, human-like fear. She's not a killer executing a plan, she's a frightened caretaker managing an impossible crisis.

""Let me see the coroner's report,"" I say quietly.

She hesitates for a long moment, then pulls up the file on her screen. I study the technical details, and within minutes, I find what I suspected. The angle of the fall doesn't match suicide. The positioning of the body suggests someone pushed Sky Studier Ris from behind. And there are forensic discrepancies that require expertise to understand but speak to deliberate alteration.

""Chancellor,"" I say carefully, ""someone killed Sky Studier Ris. And they made you complicit in covering it up.""

Her shoulders sag slightly, and for a moment, she looks exactly like what she is—a being overwhelmed by impossible circumstances. ""Yes. Someone wanted his research suppressed. I was given a choice: help cover it up, or watch our society collapse in panic. I chose to save us from ourselves.""

But I know in my human intuition that she's not the killer. The fear in her eyes is too real, too raw. She's a coward managing a catastrophe, not a cold-blooded murderer.

*Day 13 on Aeterna*

My next suspect is Studier Senna, and finding him requires navigating the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the Planetary Defense Ministry. Here, surrounded by the gentle, contemplative Aeternans who make up most of the scientific establishment, Studier Senna stands out like a human in a room full of aliens.

He moves with the same characteristic sloth-like grace as his people, but there's a tension in his movements, a barely contained energy that makes him seem almost agitated by Aeternan standards. His fur is lighter than most, nearly white, and his eyes dart around constantly as if he's perpetually calculating something.

When I find him in his office—surrounded by impact simulation displays and models of planetary catastrophe—he doesn't seem surprised to see me. In fact, he seems almost relieved.

""Detective Dibble,"" he says, his melodic voice carrying undertones of something I can't quite identify. ""I've been expecting you.""

""Have you?"" I settle into the chair across from his desk, noting how he speaks in the direct, almost urgent manner that seems to be the unofficial language of the Defense Ministry. ""Why's that?""

""Because I'm the obvious suspect."" He moves to his computer terminal and pulls up a file with practiced efficiency. ""Sky Studier Ris and I co-authored early papers on orbital irregularities. Then we had what your species might call a 'bitter falling out.' He got the funding, the recognition, the observatory access. I got relegated to this bureaucratic office running impact simulations.""

His fingers tap across his keyboard with what I now recognize as an almost human level of agitation. ""Professional jealousy turned pathological, as your investigation files probably put it.""



""Access logs show you entered Sky Studier Ris's building the night of the murder, Studier Senna.""

""I know. That's why I'm expecting you."" He pulls up another file, this one showing architectural blueprints and security footage. ""But check the timestamps, Detective. See what time I actually accessed his building.""

I study the data, and my blood runs cold. The timestamps show Studier Senna entered the building at 11:47 PM and left at 11:52 PM. Five minutes total. Just long enough to access the main research terminal and upload what appears to be massive amounts of data.

""What were you doing in there for five minutes?"" I ask.

""Feeding him information."" Studier Senna's voice takes on a quality I've heard in human scientists when they're explaining work they're passionate about. ""I was feeding him Defense Ministry gravitational models. Imperial data he couldn't access from his observatory. Why would I kill the one person who still treated me like a scientist?""

He pulls up another file, this one showing email exchanges between him and Sky Studier Ris that go back months. The tone is increasingly collaborative, almost excited. They're working together again, anonymously, yes, but collaborating nonetheless.

""Studier Senna,"" I say slowly, ""are you telling me you were helping Sky Studier Ris with his eclipse research?""

""Up until the day before his death."" His large eyes meet mine with something like pride mixed with grief. ""We were going to publish together, Detective. The amateur and the professional. Two Aeternan scientists trying to save their world.""

The pieces are starting to form a picture that's more terrifying than anything I've discovered so far. Studier Senna didn't kill Sky Studier Ris, he was helping him. The suicide ruling, the cover-up, the suppression of the research... it's all too clean, too organized for a single killer.

But it fits perfectly with someone who has access to everything Sky Studier Ris was working on, someone who understands the implications of his research better than anyone else, someone with both motive and opportunity to silence him permanently.



*Day 14 on Aeterna*

I'm sitting in Sky Studier Ris's empty observatory, surrounded by the instruments he used to discover Aeternity's expiration date. The irony isn't lost on me that as a human detective, I have a different relationship with cosmic horror than these alien beings. For humans, the universe is vast and dark and hostile. For the Aeternans, the universe is supposed to be warm and golden and safe.

Three suspects, three motives, and none of them fit the crime scene I keep analyzing in my mind. The precision. The staging. The knowledge of Sky Studier Ris's schedule, his security codes, his private research. This wasn't a crime of passion or professional jealousy. This was surgical.

That's when I find it in Sky Studier Ris's encrypted files. A second dataset that shouldn't exist, running calculations that go far beyond the eclipse itself. The timestamp shows these models were updated just hours before his death.

Sky Studier Maren. His graduate assistant. Two-Hundred Twenty-six years old, which makes her barely an adult by Aeternan standards. Brilliant, quiet, with access to everything Sky Studier Ris was working on. And according to the institutional records, she's been running her own independent research for months.

The calculations she has are elegant in their horror. Sky Studier Ris discovered the eclipse, but Sky Studier Maren discovered what comes after. She didn't just calculate the darkness, she calculated what the darkness reveals.

Aeterna sits in a globular cluster. When the six suns go dark during the eclipse, 30,000 stars ignite the sky in brilliant, infinite detail. For a species that evolved in constant golden light, never seeing the cosmos, never understanding their place in an infinite universe... she ran psychological projections that chilled me to my human bones.

The result: total, irreversible madness. Not death by fire, not death by darkness, death by the complete collapse of everything they believed about their reality. Seeing infinite space, infinite darkness, infinite insignificance, combined with species-wide darkness phobia equals guaranteed extinction.

Sky Studier Ris wanted to warn them, prepare them, give them hope. Sky Studier Maren understood that hope would make it worse. The knowledge itself would be the killing blow.

I find her in the main planetary observatory, standing before a massive viewing platform that shows the six suns beginning their convergence in the sky. She's calm, almost serene, waiting for me with the characteristic patience of her species.

""Detective,"" she says, her voice carrying that familiar melodic quality but with something underneath it. Something that sounds almost... human. ""I wondered when you would find me.""

""Sky Studier Maren, I need to ask you about Sky Studier Ris's death.""

""I know."" She turns to face me, and I see something in her large dark eyes that unsettles me more than any alien feature. Intelligence. Deep, terrible intelligence. ""He wanted to warn them, Detective. Prepare them somehow. But you can't prepare for this. I showed him the star models, the psychological projections. He understood then, warning them makes it worse. But he was going to broadcast anyway. He thought hope mattered more than mercy.""



She gestures to the sky where the six suns are beginning their convergence, creating patterns of light that seem almost hypnotic. ""I gave them ignorance. It's the only kindness left.""

""By killing him?""

""By ensuring he wouldn't be able to broadcast his findings."" Her three-fingered hands move with their characteristic grace as she pulls up a display showing astronomical charts. ""Sky Studier Ris was going to use every available channel to warn the world, Detective. Newspapers, public broadcasts, internet forums. The panic would have started immediately.""

""And you decided to kill him instead?""

""I decided to let them have sixty-four more days of normalcy."" Her voice carries no emotion, no regret—nothing that I can recognize as human feeling. ""Sixty-four more days where children play under golden light, where adults sleep without nightmares, where lovers watch sunsets together in ignorant bliss.""

I realize with growing horror that Sky Studier Maren isn't just brilliant, she's beyond anything I can comprehend. She performed the ultimate cost-benefit analysis and decided that murder is a reasonable price for letting her people die in peace instead of terror.

""Sky Studier Maren,"" I say quietly, ""you know that doesn't make it right.""

She tilts her head, that characteristic sloth-like gesture taking on new meaning when performed by someone capable of this level of calculated violence. ""Detective, what would you do? If you discovered that your species' knowledge of their place in the universe would kill them instantly? If warning them would be the killing blow?""

I have no answer for that question, and she knows it.

As I leave the observatory that night, I realize I'm facing something that transcends normal human concepts of justice. In eighty-three days, these gentle, contemplative beings will experience something that will end their civilization not through violence, just madness.

And someone has decided that ignorance is more merciful than truth.

1pbh9n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/kolkata/comments/1pbh9n4/too_little_too_late/,Too Little Too Late,"*In 1995, Harry Potter received a Christmas gift that he did not open for almost half a year. When he did, it was too little too late.*

---

Today I woke up with a terrible headache. Adhir was already present at the open window, one foot tapping an impatient rhythm against the floor. The sheets had braided themselves around me like a constrictor. I peeled myself free, shut my laptop with a resigned thud, and tried to gather the pieces of my mind still scattered across innumerable PDFs. I’d fallen asleep mid-revision. When I walked past Adhir, he reached for my arm and looked at me with his tired yet kind eyes. 

“Look,” he said with a smile, “it’s already too late to cram. Why don’t we go listen to some music instead?” 

I didn’t want to. I needed to brush my teeth and water the plants, one had already started to wilt, then refill the bottles, honestly they needed cleaning, heat the milk for my grandfather, the floor had to be swept, load the laundry, and the curtains— I sighed. The list was long. 

“You cannot possibly do all that in an hour,” Adhir said in a chirpy tone. He was already holding out my mobile and the earphones in his hands. “C’mon. Let’s go relax.” 

And so, I went.

---

The sun still hid shyly behind a veil of clouds when we climbed to the roof. Earphones in, I wandered in slow circles. Adhir wandered with me. We spoke of my dreams, the book I’d write someday, the job I’d land, the exam I’d ace, the Master’s program I’d finally join, the blog I kept promising to update. I’d recited versions of my future to him a thousand times. In sixth grade, I’d told him I would become an astronaut; by tenth, a doctor. With Adhir, the future was always a fantasy we built together and broke together. 

Adhir has been with me for fourteen years. I’d been writing multiplication tables, just as my mother had instructed before leaving for work. I was an obedient kid; did everything I was told. I was sitting cross-legged on the verandah overlooking the thicket when he ran up to me like a golden retriever. His clothes were bright, impossible to ignore. He spoke in a mesmerising voice. Halfway through my tables, I stopped to listen. He moved in circles around me, and before I knew it, I had risen to follow him, weaving around the trees. My homework lay abandoned and unfinished; later, I paid for it with a beating from my mother. 

I’d asked him his name. 

“Adhir,” he’d said cheerfully. 

“What does it mean?” 

“Lively,” he’d replied with a smile. 

Four years later, during a boring Bengali class, my teacher had said the word meant “turbulent.” I’d wondered if lively and turbulent meant the same thing.

---

By the time we climbed back down, it was already 7:25 A.M. I hadn’t realised how quietly the minutes had slipped away until I caught sight of my neighbour, the eternally curious Mrs. Mukherjee, peering at me with squinted, investigative eyes from her terrace. Whenever I talked with Adhir, people looked at me as though I’d committed murder. Heat crept up my neck and I hurried downstairs before the embarrassment settled any deeper. 

The house felt too bright for how uncollected I was. Sunlight pierced through the curtains in thin, bright lines. In the kitchen, I noticed the drying tulsi by the window. Its leaves drooped like tired eyelids. I reached for the water bottle, found it empty, walked to fill it, and then saw my toothbrush waiting on the sink, untouched. I remembered I hadn’t brushed my teeth. I wiped the mirror with my sleeve, uncapped the toothpaste, capped it, then uncapped it again because I’d totally forgotten to squeeze some onto my brush. 

My grandfather called my name from the living room, his voice rough with sleep. I jolted. The toothbrush lay on the counter with toothpaste drying at the tip. I hurried to him. He sat hunched in his armchair, blinking against the sunlight. 

“Do we have milk?” he asked. 

“Yes, Dadu. I’ll warm it up.” I could hear the uncertainty in my voice. 

Back in the kitchen, I rotated the knob on the gas stove, placed a pot and poured the milk. A faint metallic scent, like something burnt, drifted past me. I paused. The overhead light flickered once, then again. Shit. I’d forgotten to replace the bulb. I switched it off hastily and ran to my room to get the new one I’d bought yesterday, only to find nothing. Perhaps I’d left it at the electronics shop; I remember Adhir pulling me away to pet a kitten. I would need to go again. Shit.

“Dadu?” I called out, walking towards the living room. “Don’t switch—“

“Hey, the milk!” Adhir pulled my sleeve and pointed at the kitchen. 

I ran back and turned off the stove. The milk had boiled over and spilled. Dadu appeared in the doorway, adjusting the knot of his shawl. 

“Everything alright?” 

“Yeah, just running behind,” I kept my gaze low. I couldn’t even heat milk without messing it up. 

Dadu smiled with that patient, worn-out warmth. “You always are.” 

Adhir leaned close, speaking as if sharing a secret. “You’ll get it together. Later. You always do. Let’s go, we have an exam to pass.” 

I wasn’t sure I would today. Once, he’d convinced me to skip school because a new anime had been released; I could’ve just watched it later. Adhir had apologised profusely, but it wasn’t him who’d ended up failing the class test. It was me. And I was half-convinced I’d fail this one as well. Except this was an important end-of-semester college exam. 

---

When I returned to my room, my phone buzzed with a notification I didn’t feel ready to look at. I’d lost friends by not replying. Lately, I’ve stopped opening WhatsApp entirely. The air felt dense, as if everything I’d left unfinished downstairs had followed me up the steps. I set my bag on the bed and unzipped it. My pencil case slipped out, lighter than it should have been. Two pens remained, both long dead. 

“No problem,” Adhir said from the doorway, leaning against the frame with practised ease. “Borrow one. Or write fast before it quits.”

“That isn’t how anything works,” I said. 

He shrugged. 

I searched my desk drawers. Receipts, loose batteries, a small old diary, still no pen. The next drawer offered dried-out highlighters that had stopped working since monsoon and a single pen with no cap. I set everything else on the table and tested the pen. It scraped the page without making a mark. 

My heartbeat quickened. 

I opened my phone to check the notification from earlier. It was our CR reminding us to bring our admit cards. 

“Oh,” I said. 

“Didn’t you print that yesterday?” Adhir asked. 

“I’d meant to.” My mouth felt dry. 

I sent it to the printer. It sputtered, then froze: `ink low`

“Please,” I muttered. 

It eventually spat out a tilted page, the ink fading in the corner. I held it carefully, uncertain whether the text would stay on the paper. 

Adhir assessed it with a brief nod, “It’s crooked but it’ll do.”

I wasn’t so sure. 

“Relax,” Adhir said as he stepped closer. “No one cares about a bloody page.”

---

I left the house with my bag only half-packed and my heartbeat too loud in my ears. Dadu waved at me at the gate, and I waved back and ran off; I was late. The morning air was sharp enough to wake me, but not enough to untangle the knots inside my mind. At the corner stall outside the metro station, I stopped and ordered coffee, hoping for something miraculous to steady me. 

Steam rose from the extra-large paper cup in thin spirals that unravelled into the cold air. It smelled warm and bitter. I wrapped my hands around the cup, letting the heat seep into the places my nerves had left cold. Adhir stood beside me, humming lightly under his breath. His foot tapped the pavement with a restless rhythm. 

“Drink it before it gets cold,” he said. 

I took a sip. The first wash of caffeine moved through me in a slow, grounding wave. My thoughts shifted, aligning for a brief second the way briefly scattered birds fall in formation mid-flight. 

When I looked up, Adhir had stopped humming. 

I walked into the station, towards the platform. The interior was bright and beautiful in its newness. Sunlight filtered through the bluish glass panels, reflecting on polished, glittery floors. I finished my coffee, disposed of the cup, and felt my head lighten. I looked back. Adhir was gone. I looked around for a few seconds and then shrugged. The boy had a habit of disappearing and appearing at weird times. Maybe he’d noticed Sujoy and gone off without telling me. 

*Careless guy.* 

I could hear the whistle of the metro engine ring out loud and before long, it pulled in with a sharp, dragging hiss. I boarded the metro alone and squeezed into a narrow space between a student with headphones and an office worker scrolling through emails. 

The warmth of the coffee still lingered in my fingers, anchoring me in the moment. There was a strange sharpness to everything: the sound of coins clinking in someone’s pockets, the perfume of the woman behind me, the small scuff marks on the floor, the fuzzy knit of my sweater against my skin. The world felt strangely sharper without Adhir’s warmth. I pulled out my phone and revised a few of the notes. It was a drop in the ocean, but at least it felt like I’d actually drunk the drop instead of spitting it out.

---

By the time I reached the college gates, the crowd looked like a tide I didn’t know how to swim in. Students held notes, muttering last-minute formulae. Some walked with purpose. Some looked as lost as I felt. I found myself a corner table in the canteen and started revising. By the third page, my thoughts began to slip again, threads pulling loose. I reached into my bag to double-check the admit card for the second time, then again a minute later just to be sure it hadn’t vanished. Anxiety fluttered against my ribs in light, persistent taps. The world blurred at the corners. 

A sigh brushed the side of my face. Then a familiar voice, soft and amused: ""Done preparing, my genius?"" 

Adhir leant against the wall beside me, arms crossed loosely. His outline wavered in the sunlight filtering through the windows. 

“Thought you were gone,” I whispered. 

“I was,” he said with a small grin. “But you’re slower again. Easier to keep up.” 

The next ten minutes went by with me trying in vain to mug up last minute. I couldn’t cram. It felt futile. Finally, I gave up and started climbing the stairs to the assigned room. Adhir drifted beside me, hands in his pockets. 

“Want a hype speech?” he asked. 

“No.” 

“Good. I didn’t have one ready.” 

---

Inside the examination hall, rows of desks stood under cold fluorescent lights. I found my seat and placed the crooked admit card in the corner. I borrowed a pen from the girl in front of me. 

When the bell rang, the invigilator handed out question papers. My heartbeat rose to my throat. When I flipped the paper over, the words swam for a moment before settling. I recognised topics I had meant to study weeks ago. Some I had skimmed last night. None looked approachable. 

I chose a question and started writing. My thoughts refused to stay still. Each sentence broke halfway. Each idea tangled before it touched paper. I tried answering the first question, then another. When the invigilator announced the halfway mark, a cold certainty settled inside me. I was going to fail. Adhir leaned his forehead against the desk next to me, eyes soft. He silently mouthed words. 

“It’s okay,” he whispered to me. “You can write the arrear exam next year.” 

When the bell rang, I handed in an answer script that felt more like an apology than an honest attempt. 

---

Outside, the campus seemed drained of colour. The sun hung low and tired, a dim bulb struggling to illuminate the world. Students moved in small, confident clusters, swapping answers with a certainty I didn’t recognise. Adhir and I were dragging our feet back towards the exit gate when I noticed a friend of mine, Ishita, waving at me. When I reached her, she asked, 

“How did the test go, Tukai?”

“Fine,” I said in a voice that did not sound fine. “Let’s wait for the results.” 

Ishita and I talked for a bit more before we bid goodbye. She went off towards the bus stop. Adhir waved at her too, but she did not notice. Most never did. Sujoy, a local boy, did notice Adhir. So had a middle school teacher of mine. My mother never noticed Adhir. The same was true for my father and grandfather. My mother had once accused me of losing my mind because she caught me speaking to empty air. But I knew someone from my family who had noticed Adhir. My uncle. 

My beloved, dead Kaka. 

I was eight when I first began seeing Adhir. Back then, Kaka still carried some small flame of hope inside him. He’d seen Adhir with me. He’d never spoken of it, yet I could read it in the way his eyes would widen with fear and in the rigid way he’d hold himself whenever Adhir lingered near me. I never asked him what he saw. I was but a child. 

By the time I turned thirteen, he was gone. Alcoholism, debt and the slow erosion of failure had eaten through that magnificent man. It still feels unreal that someone who’d once performed beside Shreya Ghoshal ended up cold and silent on a day that should have been nothing more than another show he kept postponing. A bright life dimmed one procrastinated rehearsal at a time. 

His picture hangs on the wall of our living room. A handsome young man with a dashing moustache. I try not to remember the pallor and the blood-streaked scars I’d seen on him the day he’d taken his life. His cat’s death, likely due to negligence, was perhaps what’d pushed him past the edge. The night before he’d take his own life, he’d snuck a small diary in my schoolbag. I’d never gotten around to reading it. 

I was pulled out of my thoughts when I heard the whistle of the metro again.

---

Adhir and I were trudging toward our neighbourhood after getting off the metro when I noticed the sign. The neon board of the electronics shop was buzzing like a dying mosquito, flickering in uneven pulses that scraped the edges of my nerves. Anxiety crawled under my skin worse than anything all day. 

*Had I told Dadu…?* 

The thought struck so hard my stomach lurched. A bitter taste climbed up my throat. I quickened my pace, the air suddenly too thin to breathe. But a tug at my sleeve stopped me. I turned.

Adhir stood behind me, hands clenched at his sides. His outline looked thinner than usual, as if guilt was erasing him from the edges inward. His eyes, usually bright, mischievous, looked washed out, almost transparent in the late-afternoon light. 

“I’m sorry,” he apologised in the same voice he had a hundred times before. 

I yanked free and kept walking, almost running. Then I saw the smoke. Thin grey threads rising above the roofs, curling upward like fingers beckoning me closer. Then the smell hit me, the smell of burnt metal and LPG. 

I ran. 

My bag slipped from my shoulder. My lungs burned, each breath scraping my throat raw. Neighbours blurred past, voices clashing around me. 

“—wait—”

“—Tukai!—”

“—don’t go there—”

I didn’t stop. The closer I got, the more the world sharpened into terrible detail. Blackened patches along our kitchen wall, the exhaust hole spitting out thin curls of smoke, a police officer speaking in urgent, low tones to a cluster of people, the neighbour’s old dog whining, tail tucked, eyes fixed on the doorway. Mr. Mukerjee's face was black with soot, his shirt red with blood. 

A hand pressed against my shoulder. I froze. A policeman. 

“You can’t go in.” 

“My grandfather—” I rasped. The words snagged in my throat. I pointed at the house. 

He held my gaze for a single, heavy second. “I’m sorry.”

---

By the evening, everyone had gathered at our partly-burnt house. My mother sobbed in raw, cracked grief, sitting near the sheet-covered, burnt corpse of her dead father. I left before I fell apart from her screams. My father held her; they’d been away on a short vacation. Guilt hung over me like a dangling dagger. Adhir was nowhere to be seen. 

*Coward.* 

I climbed the stairs to my room. Amid worn receipts and empty highlighters lay a small diary. My hands trembled as I picked it up.  I flipped to the first page. The handwriting was unmistakably his, a musician’s elegant hand. The memory of those fingers, once quick on a guitar, bruised by its strings, and later cold and blood-stiffened, flashed across my mind. 

My uncle’s diary. The one he’d given me years ago. The one I’d never opened. I swallowed hard and flipped it open. The first page read: 

>*“This is a memoir of my life from the age of seven till, I suppose, the night before my death. Turbulence is not life. It’s a curse that’ll kill you or make you kill someone (or both if you’re unfortunate like me). Get help before it’s too late and a brilliant life is snuffed out by disorder. Read this so you don’t repeat my mistakes.”*
