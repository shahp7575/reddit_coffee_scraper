1gktm2b,https://i.redd.it/vs7d0x34p8zd1.jpeg,Is motion design suitable for all e-commerce brands?,"
üé¨ Lights, Camera‚Ä¶ Wait, Where‚Äôs the Product?!
Ever wondered if motion design is like a magic ingredient that turns any brand into a cinematic masterpiece? Motion design can give sneakers a starring role, make skincare products look like they descended from skincare heaven, and even make a humble coffee mug feel like it‚Äôs about to spill a big secret. But is it really for every e-commerce brand?

üçï Pizza or Gucci: The Reality Check
Here‚Äôs the deal‚Äîmotion design works wonders for e-commerce brands that want to create a ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù moment, but it‚Äôs not about making everything look like the next Marvel blockbuster. Imagine giving a sleek, minimalistic vibe to a luxury watch. Now, try that same vibe on a slice of pepperoni pizza. Same tools, wildly different results, right? Motion design has to match the brand, or it risks feeling as forced as pineapples on a pizza. (Yeah, I went there.)

üìà Engagement Olympics ‚Äì Motion Design Is Going for Gold!
Let‚Äôs be real: everyone‚Äôs fighting for attention, and that‚Äôs where motion design shines. If your brand lives and dies by Instagram likes or TikTok views, using smooth, eye-catching motion design is like bringing an Olympian to the scrolling games. People stop. They stare. They even remember you! For any e-commerce brand looking to win the engagement marathon, motion design can really set them apart.

üé© A Little Magic Goes a Long Way ‚Äì Know When to Use It!
For e-commerce, motion design is like a magic trick: if it enhances your product‚Äôs story, it works like a charm. But if it‚Äôs just about flashy effects? Not so much. It‚Äôs like putting sequins on everything in your wardrobe. Sure, it‚Äôs fun, but maybe save some wow for the special moments. Just because you can animate every frame doesn‚Äôt mean you should. Strategic motion design is the trick to keep the viewer enchanted and still focused on your product.


---

üöÄ Boring to Blazing: Does It Add Firepower to Your Brand?
The final test: ask yourself if motion design actually elevates the story. If a brand‚Äôs message is ‚Äúeco-friendly, simple, and sustainable,‚Äù then maybe smooth, subtle animations will give it that fresh, approachable vibe. But if the brand is all about intensity and speed? Crank it up, get that dynamic 3D animation going, and let motion design take it to the next level!


---

üé§ Mic Drop ‚Äì Should Every Brand Go Motion?
So, does every e-commerce brand need motion design? Not necessarily. It‚Äôs like seasoning‚Äîget it just right, and it‚Äôs perfect. Overdo it, and people are left confused. Motion design can be a showstopper, but the key is knowing when it‚Äôs your show‚Äôs opening act and when it‚Äôs the grand finale. If done right, it‚Äôs not just suitable‚Äîit‚Äôs unbeatable!

I've stopped taking it regularly cause I don't have class everyday, but in highschool I took it every weekday at 7-8am and it would take forever to stop feeling the effects. Usually like 4-6am, so I very regularly got less than 3 hrs of sleep each night. Even without vyvanse I tend to stay up really late, usually till 3 am, so I was medicated clonidine, and it's been very helpfull but whenever I'm on vyvanse it seems to do nothing. 
I don't wanna switch adhd meds cause I've already tried a few others and vyvanse was the only one that worked. And I tried decreasing the dose from 40 to 30mg , however it didn't help my sleep but it affected my productivity so I switched back.
I'm sure it could just be a me thing cause if I ever have coffee or an energy drink it takes especially long to stop effecting me. Should I try drinking more water? maybe I don't pee enough, does that make a significant difference? I also haven't quite solved the whole appetite suppression problem, so if that somehow effects it.
My brother is also on vyvanse but he doesn't have these sleep problems. Infact he can regularly recognize when the vyvanse starts wearing off, usually around 10pm. I've tried asking him if he does anything special to help it wear off but he doesnt know either, so I think I'm doing something wrong.

Hi, people of Reddit, I'm looking for my hopeful forever, I'm tired of being alone!

What I'm looking for:   
I want someone close to me, south central Ohio, who can drive (I can't due to Tourettes but I'd help with gas!). I want to go do fun activities, whether it be look at holiday lights, feed geese, cuddle up and binge a show, or grab coffee and lunches. I just don't want to be alone, I want to cuddle, and feel cared for, I crave the affection and companionship. I'm not much on sex, it's really a take or leave with me as I'm on the ace umbrella of sexuality. I want someone my age or preferably older, think 25-38 ideally, and this sounds weird but due to trauma of abuse, no bald men? I'm sorry that sounds so picky but it's a trauma thing. 

What do you get from dating me?  
You get a number one fan, whether it's you playing games or going to work or just having a day, I'll be there for you! If I'm feeling good, I might bake you something nice and sweet, and I make crafts so you could benefit there. I'm a great listener, funny as all get out (At least my friends say) and I'm plus size so great for cuddling. I'll always be down for cuddles, or a day in, or light activities out and about. I'm absolutely loyal. 

The cons:  
I have mental health issues so I need reassurance a lot? And Tourettes makes me say noises or do movements beyond my control, my knees don't work great but I am mobile, and I mean, I'm just not the best, but maybe I'm perfect for you if we try.

This is where your brand story comes into play.¬†

A compelling brand story can turn casual browsers into loyal buyers by creating an emotional connection that transcends mere product details. Your brand story embodies your values, mission, and the journey that brought your products to life.¬†

It‚Äôs what differentiates your offerings from the countless alternatives available at a click. By weaving your story into every aspect of your¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†presence, you not only highlight what makes your products unique but also foster trust and loyalty among your audience.¬†

*Read More:*¬†[*Why Amazon Video Product Ads Convert Better: The Power of Visual Storytelling*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/why-amazon-video-product-ads-convert-better-the-power-of-visual-storytelling/)

# Product Specs vs. Brand Story: What Buyers Really Care About

# The Importance of Product Specifications

Product specifications refer to all the important information about a product. It is usually accompanied by size, material, weight, and functionality. The buyers bank on these specifics to determine whether such a product will suit their needs.

* For example, a person who wants a laptop will most probably prioritize specifications like processing power, RAM, storage capacity, and battery life. This kind of information presented with the utmost clarity and accuracy by a seller could go a long way toward winning the confidence of a buyer who feels that he is in a position to decide well.

However, spec-based alone contributes only to a buyer-product transactional relationship. This is most apparent in categories like electronics or appliances, where technical details are important.¬†

But while product specs are a strong foundation upon which to understand the product, they rarely achieve the emotional resonance that truly dictates a buying decision.



# The Role of Brand Storytelling

A brand story is the history or account of a product or a brand. It can tell the values or missions and also the special path that transformed into a brand. It is this kind of story that can produce an emotional connection to the target market so that the buyers can associate at the deepest level with the brand.¬†

* For instance, a brand that emphasizes its sustainability and ethical sourcing in its brand story can attract environmentally conscious consumers who value these issues.

When a brand has a great story, it invites buyers to become part of that story.¬†

* Take TOMS Shoes, for example. Its ‚ÄúOne for One‚Äù initiative means that for every pair purchased, a pair is donated to someone in need. That‚Äôs a very powerful story that sets TOMS apart from competitors and aligns with the values of customers who wish to make a positive impact through their purchases.

¬†

# Unlocking the Purchasing Behavior: Emotional Attachments

In several studies, emotional attachments form an integral part of consumer behaviors. The most simple buyers based on feelings rather than logic decide their purchases. Whenever they are able to associate with the emotionally charged brand story, they feel attached or loyal to that brand.¬†

* In fact, Apple is quite a good storyteller. The central element of their marketing campaigns involves innovation, creativity, and a way of life that resonates with the target audience. This often results in an emotional pull to Apple products over competitors offering better specs at lower prices.

¬†

# Brand Authenticity Matters

With authentic claims, authenticity is critical in the market today. Consumers are very discerning and can easily detect any false claim. It is a brand story that has genuine values and a true mission of talking to buyers.¬†

* For example, Patagonia expresses its¬†[Amazon brand](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/9-reasons-why-your-amazon-brand-needs-an-engaging-storefront/)¬†story as a celebration of the activist attitude towards environmental causes. Customers, in return, buy the product for its cause, and customer loyalty is higher.

When product specifications are supported by a real brand story, they take on new importance.¬†

* For instance, a brand selling running shoes will talk about its technology and design but also the cause it supports by promoting running in local communities; that is how product specs take on a larger story that consumers can connect with and support.

*Read More:*¬†[*The Mobile Conundrum: Optimizing Amazon Listings for Smartphone Shoppers*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/the-mobile-conundrum-optimizing-amazon-listings-for-smartphone-shoppers/)

# Differentiation in an Overcrowded Marketplace

When there are millions of products on¬†**Amazon FBA,**¬†it gets very competitive, and thus, differentiation is what one needs. Product specifications may not be the only factors that make a difference in crowded marketplaces. A captivating brand story can be the unique approach, targeting a buyer‚Äôs focus.¬†

* For example, when a customer wants to find a skincare product, he or she can find several products with almost the same ingredients. But when a brand tells its story about where it came from, how it was inspired, and what benefits it has to customers, then the competition rises.
* Consider Drunk Elephant as an example, a skincare brand focusing on ‚Äúclean-clinical‚Äù products but telling the personal story of its founder. By such communication, the customer emotionally connects with the brand and simultaneously knows what is different and what the benefit is in a product.

¬†

# The Shift Toward Experience Over Specifications

A modern customer favors an experience over mere material possessions. A story by a brand based on customer experiences is more effective than a specification list itself.¬†

* For example, if a kitchen equipment seller shares stories about families coming together to make memories with their product, the buyer finds an emotional value in cooking and family bonding. This relationship might make the prospective buyer more likely to buy the product than if they were only given technical specifications.

¬†

# Building Trust with Storytelling

Trust is crucial in any online marketplace such as¬†**Amazon FBA.**¬†Buyers will generally not buy products that lack transparency or authenticity. A brand story about the journey of the brand, challenges faced along the way, and achievements can help build credibility.¬†

* For instance, a small business can gain trust by announcing grassroots roots and including statements from actual customers. Buyers tend to buy when they feel they know the brand personally.

¬†

# Visual Storytelling Role

Adding pictures to your brand story can give it a more lifelike impact. Good photographs and videos that narrate tell product specifications well, too. For example,¬†[lifestyle images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/)¬†show how one can use the product to tell a story, which would appeal to the buyer.¬†

* It is pretty effective, especially when a buyer has many choices in¬†**Amazon FBA**, for instance. A seller of outdoor gear could take¬†**listing images**¬†and videos that tell of adventures through their products; this would transform mere specifications into a story.

¬†

# Testimonials and Social Proof

Through customer testimonials in your brand story, you can successfully integrate both product specifications and emotional connections. Real-life experiences from satisfied customers are what make the authenticity and credibility of the brand stick in the minds of the buyers.

* For instance, a fitness equipment-selling brand might include testimonials sharing how the product has transformed users‚Äô lives. This integration of social proof and storytelling can really drive the purchasing decision.

¬†

# Balance Between Specs and Story

A compelling brand story is important, but it must not completely outshine product specifications. Buyers still want to know the details that would affect performance and usability.¬†

The best way of combining both is one that lets customers be well-informed about the important information they need while at the same time, making them feel emotionally attached to the brand.¬†

* For example, a technology brand selling a new gadget may provide an entire specification along with an innovation story and the direction of the brand for the future. This is a combination of the rational and emotional mindset of the consumer in determining a purchase.

¬†

# Branding and Long-Term Loyalty

Customer loyalty is not a one-time purchase; when a customer identifies the story of a brand, they will come back to it again. A good story, therefore, creates loyalty by inducing a sense of belonging and even community.

* Inspirational brands like Nike, which speak so much about inspiration and perseverance, generate an enormous return for these brands, paying a premium and yet yielding loyalty not because of product specs but the overall storyline of the brand that talks to people‚Äôs values and aspirations.

¬†

# Brand Story in Alignment with Target Audience

Understanding who your target audience is forms the basis of building a brand story. A value- and desire-driven story may resonate better with your audience than any other because it speaks to the pain points, needs, or desires of your audience.¬†

* For example, when your target market is a millennial who values sustainability, that can really be woven into a brand story and make some significant connections. Brands like All Birds have been able to leverage their brand story in conjunction with the audience‚Äôs values in such aspects as using eco-friendly materials and practices.

¬†

This impacts how visible your product will be on Amazon FBA¬† as well. A well-crafted brand story can help improve rankings from related keywords.¬†

Every time the customer searches for products according to their personal values, an effective brand story makes it easier to find your product. You improve the visibility of your product using related keywords yet remain emotionally connected with your potential buyer.

¬†

# Crafting a Unique Brand Story for Amazon FBA Success

# The Founder‚Äôs Journey: A Personal Touch

Telling the story of a founder is one of the most interesting ways to get in touch with audiences. It humanizes the brand, and customers connect with the person behind the product.

* For instance, a skincare brand begins with an experience where its founder had a problem concerning issues to the skin, then proceeds to try to create solutions to such problems that would be great for everyone. That‚Äôs not only authenticity but relates to a similar struggle.

In winning adversity, success sometimes manifests in the face of overcoming challenges. Stories of how some people have overcome adversities can inspire and motivate customers. A small business, which started when the economy was at its worst and eventually thrived, can attract consumers who like resilience.

* For instance, a food brand can tell its audience how it started from a small kitchen operation to becoming a thriving brand, all fueled by dedication and passion.

¬†

# Sustainability commitment. Brand for purpose

It is a highly distinctive brand that prioritizes sustainability in today‚Äôs world. A firm narrates a compelling story by talking about its commitment to eco-friendly practices and ethical sourcing of materials.

* The clothes brand can talk about making clothes from recyclable material, thus offering fair labor practices appealing to an eco-conscious shopper who wants purchases to align with their values.

¬†

# Innovations Customer Centric Driven¬†

Brand Story Innovations are driven based on consumer needs: This will depict a message of improvement and responsiveness.¬†

* For example, a technological gadget brand that focuses on how consumer suggestions have been used to advance its product will come up with a personal story of collaboration with its consumers. This will imply trust in the brand as well as the value given to every feedback from its audience.

¬†

# Heritage Celebration: Restore Traditions and Cultures

Any brand that celebrates heritage or cultural roots can forge an emotional bond with the customer. A food brand sharing a recipe passed on through generations may appeal to those who seek authenticity.¬†

* For instance, a spice brand may narrate how the founder‚Äôs grandmother taught the grandmother of secrets behind traditional cooking to attract authentic and traditional buyers.

¬†

# Community Involvement: Giving Back to Society

Community involvement and social responsibility are the most powerful stories that a brand can tell. Beauty brands donate a portion of their profits to local charities or otherwise as the brand seems to engage in community development drawing customers to ethical consumption.¬†

This commitment increases not only brand loyalty but also builds a respectable image in the marketplace.

¬†

# Craftsmanship and Quality: The Artisan Approach

What may define a brand from another might be the emphasis on the craftsmanship and detail in coming up with the product. A jewelry brand, for example, can use the story of how each piece is carefully crafted to portray that quality and detail in it.¬†

* Such appeal by a brand to the craftsmanship and detail with which products are created would appeal to artisanal good lovers and willing payers.

¬†

# Power of Collaboration: Joining with Other Brands

Partnering with other brands can give brands a unique story that increases their visibility. Imagine a soft drink brand partnering with a local bakery to create some special flavor pairings.¬†

This may attract people looking for unique taste combinations; the collaborative story brings excitement but also extends its audience to both parties involved.

¬†

# Wellness Focus: Health, Well Being

In an increasingly health-conscious market, a brand that focuses on wellness becomes a beacon for a loyal following. A nutritional supplement brand that shows the stories of customers reaching their health goals because of its products creates a very inspiring story.

¬†The wellness focus resonates with consumers and helps to position the brand as one trusted in and on their health journeys.

¬†

# The Adventure Spirit: Embracing Exploration and Discovery

A brand that speaks to adventure and exploration inspires the imagination of its audience. The outdoor gear brand inspires its customers by showing them real adventures in which people use the products in harsh conditions.¬†

This story inspires the customer to see himself in an exciting scenario, creating a strong bond with the brand.

¬†

# Family Values: The Legacy Passed Down

Family values when attached to a¬†[brand story](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/why-is-amazons-brand-story-significant-for-your-brand/), are warm and inviting. The food brand would come in with recipes passed through generations of comfort and nostalgia for those looking for it.

¬†In such a case, pasta boasts of its Italian roots by emphasizing the family tradition from which the products originated in their claims of authenticity and root-ness.

¬†

# The Innovation Pioneer: Industry Leader

The innovative brands talk of being a pioneer. Tech brands present themselves from being startups to leaders in their industry by stressing groundbreaking products that take the market by storm and attract tech-savvy customers. The story gives the impression that the brand is innovative and plays the game of the future.

¬†

# The Unsung Hero: Daily Champion

It creates a great emotional relationship with the brand by focusing on and making heroes out of everyday ones. Think of a brand manufacturing cleaning products that communicate the stories of essential employees who are utilizing their cleaning products to clean up their communities.¬†

This kind of brand campaign can help develop the brand identity of a firm while increasing customer loyalty since many admire the values represented by this type of brand.

¬†

# ¬†Cultural Stories: Cultural Diversity Inclusive

It celebrates cultural diversity and inclusivity, thus being more meaningful to a larger population. Fashion brands sharing the stories of models from diverse backgrounds or telling of cultural awareness would appeal more to those consumers seeking representations.¬†

The story promotes the feeling of belongingness, which in turn helps strengthen a relationship with the brand.

¬†

# Passion for Craft: The Story Behind the Product

Storytelling that refers to passion and dedication in making the product is very engaging. For example, a coffee brand tells the story from bean to cup, paying attention to the selection and roasting processes that can make a coffee lover buy the coffee.

¬†That is because this story communicates quality and passion for the product. Most consumers appreciate fine products.

¬†

# Change Adaptability: Keeping Pace with Consumers‚Äô Needs

The ability to be flexible on changing consumer tastes is a beautiful story that brands can bring about. A fashion brand that is able to evolve from using non-toxic materials due to customer demands will attract consumers who care about the environment. The story here explains how the brand evolves and stays responsive to the needs of consumers.

¬†

# ¬†The Local Connection: Support Small Businesses

A brand story that emphasizes local roots and small business support can speak to consumers who care about making a positive difference.¬†

* For example, if a skincare brand sources its ingredients from regional farmers, then customers might find appeal in community support. This story not only strengthens brand loyalty but also creates a positive image for your brand in the marketplace.

¬†

# The Science of Innovation: Relied Upon by Research

Brands that tell how evidence-based their products are tend to attract customers who perceive them as evidence-based products to consumers. A skincare firm could have a strong story demonstrating to the consumers how all those formulations are based upon different studies from dermatology.

Science builds the strength of credibility and puts the brand in authority that is trusted by that respective industry.

¬†

# The Origin Story of How an Offer Went from Concept to Distribution

Something that is shared from design to market entry makes for an interesting story. A gadget brand might show its new innovative product during the designing and testing stage, attracting customers by their love for technology. Such a back-story tells a lot about transparency and builds excitement in a future buyer.

¬†

# A vision of the Future: Communicating long-term goals

Consumers might be motivated by a brand story talking of a future vision. A renewable energy brand could easily attract green-conscious customers who care about their future by sharing their commitment to a sustainable future.

¬†It will position the brand as an industry leader to appeal to those who wish to be part of something positive while strictly following the current trend.

¬†

# Creating an Emotional Hook in Your Brand Story

# Share Real Experiences

Authenticity is critical when you want to develop an emotional hook in your brand story. The consumer today is wise and can easily catch a sense of insincerity or marketing gimmickry.¬†

Real experiences are the only things that could make your audience connect to you better, whether it‚Äôs the journey of the founder, testimonials from the customers, or¬†[behind-the-scenes](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=14123cd005ed1c71JmltdHM9MTcyOTkwMDgwMCZpZ3VpZD0yNzJjMjUzMi0wNTEzLTYyNzctMjhiOC0zNzJhMDQxYTYzMDQmaW5zaWQ9NTIzOA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=272c2532-0513-6277-28b8-372a041a6304&psq=behind-the-scenes+stories+forbes&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm9yYmVzLmNvbS9zaXRlcy9yb25jYXJ1Y2NpLzIwMjEvMDQvMDQvYmVoaW5kLXRoZS1zY2VuZXMtb2YtYmVzdC1idXlzLXJlY29yZC1zZXR0aW5nLXR1cm5hcm91bmQtd2l0aC1odWJlcnQtam9seS8&ntb=1)¬†stories.¬†

* Take Coca-Cola‚Äôs ‚ÄúShare a Coke‚Äù campaign. The brand replaced its iconic logo with popular names. It personalized the brand and created a sense of community, leading to increased sales and brand engagement, by encouraging consumers to find bottles with their names and share the experience with friends and family.

¬†

# Nostalgia

Nostalgia is one of the most powerful emotional triggers that can be applied effectively in brand storytelling. Those brands that evoke some fond memories are directly connected on an emotional level with their audience.¬†

* For example, in the case of LEGO, it has capitalized on the nostalgia factor by marketing its old sets in a nearly new product. Nudging parents to relive their childhood LEGO memories, the brand creates a nostalgia, which inspires purchases both for themselves and for their children. This emotive hook pushes sales but also leads to a deeper connection with the brand since it makes LEGO appear as that source of creativity and joy centuries ago.

¬†

# Use of Humor and Lightheartedness

Humor can serve effectively to build an emotive hook. When a brand makes consumers laugh, it not only grabs attention but also develops a positive association. The first brand I have learned is Old Spice, as this brand used humor during its product advertising.

* For instance, one of the memorable ‚ÄúThe Man Your Man Could Smell Like‚Äù makes buying a deodorant very interesting. Humor through its brand story has positioned Old Spice away from many brands to create a relationship, though emotional with the client that enjoys a lighthearted advertisement.

¬†

# Pain Points

A good emotional hook also refers to the pain points of your target audience. Brands can create a dramatic story by showing that they understand their audience

* For instance, Dove‚Äôs ‚ÄúReal Beauty‚Äù campaign challenged standard beauty-oriented thinking and insecurity in many women regarding their appearance. By showing real women, with different shapes, sizes, and backgrounds, Dove was able to create a familiar storyline while also encouraging people to hold their heads high.

¬†The emotional connection with customers was higher when purchasing Dove because they knew they were assisting a brand that was distinct from others, for it was about authenticity and self-acceptance.

¬†

# Emotional Hook: Building Community Around Your Brand

Emotional hook can also refer to building a sense of community around your brand. The more the customer belongs to you, the more engaged he is with your brand. Harley-Davidson created a sense of belonging for their customers.¬†

By focusing the brand on the lifestyle and camaraderie attached to the product, the brand develops an emotional involvement over and above the sale of the product.¬†

This sense of belonging promotes loyalty and will have customers that are more likely to act as advocates for the brand, thereby organically generating growth through word-of-mouth.

¬†

The final strong emotional hook comes from the expression of the values that your brand believes in. Today‚Äôs consumer increasingly wants to support a cause by purchasing a product with a brand that believes in those causes.¬†

* Patagonia has made environmental responsibility and sustainability its core belief for building its brand. A promise by Patagonia toward earth preservation and an appeal to consumers to consume less leads to a story that clicks for the conscious consumerism for environment care.¬†

A shared sense of values strengthens an emotive bond and converts consumer groups into supporters of that particular brand.

¬†

# How to Use Data to Enhance Your Brand Story

Customer feedback is a treasure trove of information that can improve your brand story. Sellers can view product reviews, ratings, and questions from¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†customers. Careful analysis will enable you to determine common themes and sentiments that arise from your customers‚Äô experiences.¬†

For instance, if many customers compliment the durability of your products, you can integrate this as the key component of your brand story.

* TrailBlazers is a firm that manufactures hiking equipment. By reading commentaries from customers, they noted that the customers are always concerned about the durability of their equipment during extreme conditions. Instead of talking about technical specifications, the brand turns its story on how their equipment withstands the test of time in all types of conditions. This makes their target buyers listen to and believe them as they also project them as a brand built on trust and quality.

¬†

# A/B Test Your Brand Story Elements

Another data-driven way of helping you amplify your brand story is A/B testing. This can help test different versions of your brand messaging,¬†**listing images**, and visuals to gather more valuable data on what resonates best with your audience.

* For example, if you were thinking about the emotional aspect of your brand versus the practical benefits of your products, you can create two totally different¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†listings-one that would focus on emotional storytelling, and another that would focus on product features.

If you imagine running a HappyPaws, your brand in pet supplies, and the decision to A/B test on two versions of a product listing for that premium dog bed. Either it is comfort and quality through materials or it tells the story of how the bed helps dogs sleep better and live happier lives.¬†

You will be able to tell which one suits the buyers the most and, based on the performance metrics, which include conversion rates and customer engagement, modify your overall brand story.

¬†

# Engaging Market Trends into Brand Story

To properly have a brand story, for example, you‚Äôll want to stay updated on the market as well as the needs of consumers. You will view reports that industries or social media and competitor strategies will eventually bring you to noticing emerging themes which fit your brand identity.¬†

If you‚Äôre one who discovers more consumers to take towards wellness and self-care, you would take the cue and jump on the trend.

* Take an example of a skincare brand, GlowEssence, focused on natural products. Analyzing its market data, it found that there was a rising trend among consumers for clean and organic skincare. GlowEssence renews its brand story with a clear message that it only uses natural ingredients and seeks to serve everyone to achieve healthy skin without the usage of toxins.¬†

Such an approach is driven more by data and not only will appeal to a larger audience but also establish GlowEssence as a natural skincare movement leader.

¬†

# Tailoring Content to Different Customer Segments

Data analysis will help you segment your audience properly. You can tailor your brand story to fit different customer groups by identifying the different segments within your customer base: first-time buyers, repeat customers, or premium buyers.

* For instance, CozyNest, an imaginary brand of home products, would examine the sales report and deduce that one group of customers frequently bought luxury bedding sets, while another group had a preference for budget-friendly sets. On such findings, CozyNest can create different brand stories for each segment.

¬†The story may then focus on the high-end, excellent quality, and exclusivity of the products for a high-end consumer, while for the budget consumer, it should talk about value and affordability without compromising on quality. Such a targeted approach helps improve engagement while increasing conversion.

Perfecting your story by using social media metrics is taken advantage of as follows:

* Social media is a treasure trove of data that can inform your brand story. When it comes to the engagement of users regarding different elements in your storytelling, you should analyze metrics such as likes, shares, and comments.

¬†Therefore, if some piece of information related to your community involvement is getting immense attention, this may suggest that your consumers are interested in that aspect of your brand.

¬†

* A brand called FitLife is an imaginary mythical fitness apparel that posts workout tips and community success stories on social media frequently. Through analytical tools for engagement metrics, they determine that customer transformation stories garner the most activity.¬†

Having understood this, FitLife comes to a conclusion to add more customer success stories in their brand story in the way FitLife products empower the user to achieve their fitness goals. This has not only supported their brand equity but also seen to be very empathetic to their customers.

¬†

# Measuring the Effect of Your Brand Story on Sales

In the end, your brand story can also be measurably effective. Using tools such as¬†**Amazon FBA‚Äôs**¬†performance analytics, the sale data conversion rates, and other customer retention metrics can be tracked before and after the changes to the story. Comparing metrics will indicate whether changes to the story influence sales and loyalty.

* For example, a new fashion brand, TrendSetters, develops a new story that conveys its commitment to sustainable fashion. It measures the sales and comments later on. Finally, it witnesses a very steep surge in sales along with hundreds of excellent comments, which simply validates that what it claims has a bearing in the minds of environmentally aware customers.

The statistics make it bold enough to concentrate on investment in such a message and subsequently develop the story.

¬†

# How to Use Influencer Partnerships to Share Your Brand Story

# Identify the right influencers for your brand

The first step in disseminating your brand story is choosing the right influencer who will be with you for the spread of your brand message. You, therefore, need to identify who shares your brand values and aesthetics.¬†

This helps make your story authentic for the people as it portrays what they believe in; the case is the same for the skin care brand that will join a beauty influencer if it is inclined towards more natural products with ethical practice.¬†[Find the influencers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-find-the-influencers-to-promote-your-amazon-product/)¬†with the passion to believe in the purpose and mission of your brand so that you may heighten your chance of getting the proper messaging across about your story.

¬†

# Building a Cooperative Storytelling

Once you‚Äôve zeroed in on an appropriate influencer, then collaborating in storytelling comes into place, which essentially includes making collaborative content wherein the message for your brand story becomes enfolded within the distinctive voice and style of your chosen influencer.

* For instance, if you are selling handmade jewelry, you can collaborate with a fashion influencer who will show how your pieces complement different outfits. The influencer can share the personal story of discovering your brand and the story behind the craftsmanship of each piece. This collaboration brings your brand to life while adding depth to the story, which makes it more engaging for the audience.

¬†

# Effective Use of Social Media Platforms

Many social media platforms influence, and each provides unique means through which to share the story of a brand. Instagram gives, for example, the scope of visually aesthetic storytelling through¬†**listing images**¬†and reels.¬†

An influencer may share a string of photos focusing on the products he has, and the caption of each image is going to reflect the brand values and mission. Through TikTok, users can connect to short, creative videos in which you can present your story with entertaining and informative content.

* For instance, a food influencer could produce a recipe video using your kitchen gadgets, telling the story of how your products make their cooking experience so much fun.

¬†

# Authentic Content: The Authenticity Factor

When using the tool of¬†[influencer marketing partnerships](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=72a9abaec970fa0bJmltdHM9MTcyOTkwMDgwMCZpZ3VpZD0yNzJjMjUzMi0wNTEzLTYyNzctMjhiOC0zNzJhMDQxYTYzMDQmaW5zaWQ9NTIxMQ&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=272c2532-0513-6277-28b8-372a041a6304&psq=influencer+partnerships+medium&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpdW0uY29tL0B5YWRhdmFiaGk5ODM1L2luZmx1ZW5jZXItbWFya2V0aW5nLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwcy1hLWd1aWRlLTg1NDFlNTZiNzBiNQ&ntb=1)¬†to share your brand story, authenticity is key. Audiences can quickly recognize insincerity, so be sure to give influencers the freedom to present your brand in a way that feels authentic to them.¬†

* For example, if your brand embodies sustainable practices, partnering with a more environmentally conscious influencer that tends to reflect your brand values will create a much more authentic story.¬†

This means the influencer may speak to their personal commitment to sustainability and how your products fit into that life, all while effectively reinforcing your brand story without sounding overly scripted or forced.

¬†

# Interaction with Influencer Content and Building Community

After influencers publish content featuring your brand story, engage with their post. Responding to their comments, sharing their post on your own social channels, and saying thank you for the support all will go a long way to foster community.¬†

* For example, if the influencer shares a story of a heart-wrenching usage experience with your product, comment on it with a word of appreciation, thus showing appreciation for the influencer as well as building rapport among his or her audience. This type of engagement might make people curious about the brand and its story behind it and eventually may even convert to sales.

¬†

# Quantifying Influencer Collaboration Outcomes

Measuring effectiveness will require tracking key performance indicators. Some of the possible metrics to track include the rate of engagement, traffic being referred to your¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†listing, and sales conversion rates.¬†

* An example would be in a scenario where an influencer uses a promotional code among his audience, helping you understand how many sales that resulted from that code, thereby measuring the success of your influencer partnership. It helps in giving you a refining influencer strategy over time and proper optimization of future campaigns by analyzing the metrics.

¬†

# Case Study: Success Story of a Fitness Apparel Brand

A good example of telling a brand story using influencer partnerships was the success story of a fitness apparel brand with fitness influencers on social media. This brand had an interesting story centered around empowering each individual to embrace his/her fitness journey.¬†

The brand engaged with influencers who shared their personal transformations in fitness. Every influencer created content showcasing the apparels while narrating the specifics of his/her journey of persistence and dedication.¬†

The authentic representation of the brand story resonated with followers and led to increases in brand awareness and sales.

¬†

# How to Use Storytelling in Email Marketing Campaigns

# Designing an Engaging Email Template

Now that you have a brand story, you have to create an engaging email template that will support your story. Your visuals of your email should be connected to your story.

* For example, if your brand story is about handcrafted products, then you would use earthy tones and¬†**listing images**¬†of artisans in action. A lifestyle email that demonstrates the use of your products in everyday life will help fortify your brand story. You can make an attractive email that captures the essence of your brand identity, which makes it easier to tell an effective story.

¬†

# Using Subject Lines to Pique Interest

Subject lines are key in email marketing. They define whether the recipient will open your email or not. Write subject lines that can evoke curiosity or emotion, related to your story.¬†

* For example, if your brand is all about overcoming struggles to make quality products, a subject line like ‚ÄúOur Journey from Struggle to Success: Discover Our Story‚Äù evokes a lot of interest among the people. This strategy not only invites opens but also structures the context of your email so that it ties into your brand story.

¬†

# Story-telling in a Segmented Manner

Email marketing cannot work without proper segmentation. Proper segmentation means sending messages that are addressed specifically to your target groups of audience.¬†

* For example, if you have various customer personas, such as eco-conscious buyers or luxury product enthusiasts, make your brand story adapt to these. For the eco-conscious, it is your commitment to sustainability and ethical practices.¬†

In contrast luxury buyers, focus on the craftsmanship and exclusivity of the products. Personalized storytelling increases relevance and engagement and will convert more.

¬†

# Telling Stories in Product Launch Emails

Launch new products by associating elements of your brand story to build excitement and anticipation. You could launch a new skincare line because you have been inspired by personal experiences that you may have had dealing with some skin issues.¬†

This will not only inform them of your product but also build more of an emotional relationship with your brand.

¬†

# Using Customer Stories to Raise Your Story

Through email marketing, customer testimonials and stories can elevate your brand story very significantly. Authenticity is added to your story through the actual experiences of satisfied customers.¬†

* For example, if it is home decor, try using a customer story that transformed their living place with the help of your products. Try sharing before and after¬†**listing images**¬†of the customer and testimonials of how your brand contributed positively to their life.

¬†It not only builds up credulity but adds strength to the argument above that your brand stands for something more than just the product-those things which can enrich one‚Äôs life.

# Develop a Storyline Series of Emails

Consider developing a storyline series of emails that are gradually revealed to your brand. This serialized approach keeps the reader interested over time and gives them something to look forward to in your emails.¬†

* For instance, you can present a five-chapter set of emails, and each time, you focus on different chapters concerning your brand story-from start with the first challenges towards customer success stories and, finally, future hopes. All this will create a scenario where you explain your story in detail yet still, connect with the audience as well.

¬†

# Conclusion

While product specifications give you the basic information, it is the story of your brand that is appealing to consumers and will bring them back for more. A good story will appeal to the emotions of the customer and turn a casual browser into a devoted buyer.¬†

Your journey, values, and mission shared with your audience not only make your products different but also give them a sense of belonging and trust in you.

¬†In the end, it‚Äôs your brand story that will transform an otherwise straightforward buy into a rich experience, making customers return to your brand again and again over the competition. Tap into the power of storytelling, and watch sales increase and brand loyalty deepen.

1gktg9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mom/comments/1gktg9c/affordable_selfcare_tips_for_moms/,Affordable Self-Care Tips For Moms,"https://preview.redd.it/rbao0ofxm8zd1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ea51640138b6662b76083d37e0c36e50be5daaa

As moms, it's easy to spend so much time taking care of others that you often forget about taking care of yourself. But self-care isn‚Äôt a luxury‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity.

The good news? You don‚Äôt have to spend a lot of money to make time for yourself. Here are some affordable self-care ideas that fit right into your budget (and your busy schedule).

**1. Create A Self-Care Routine At Home**

You don‚Äôt need to visit a spa to unwind. Turn your home into a mini oasis with affordable candles, essential oils, or even a warm bath with Epsom salts. Block out just 15-30 minutes each day to relax and recharge.

**2. Set A Budget For ‚ÄúMe Time‚Äù**

Yes, self-care deserves its own budget category. Whether it‚Äôs grabbing a cup of coffee alone, getting your nails done, or attending a yoga class, setting aside a small amount each month for self-care can give you guilt-free time to focus on yourself.

**3. Prioritize What Makes You Feel Good**

Self-care isn‚Äôt always about pampering. It can also be about what brings you peace and balance. That could be taking a walk, journaling, or reading a book. Make a list of your favorite affordable activities and schedule them regularly.

**4. Swap Services With Friends**

Do you have a mom friend who could use a break too? Offer to swap babysitting for a few hours so you each get time to focus on yourself. You get your ""me time"" without having to hire a sitter or spend extra money.

**5. Use Free Resources For Fitness and Wellness**

There are tons of free self-care resources available online, from workout videos on YouTube to meditation apps and podcasts that can help you relax and destress. Taking care of your body and mind doesn‚Äôt have to cost a dime.

**6. Invest In Tools That Help You Stay Balanced**

Sometimes, investing in small tools can have a big impact. For example, buying a simple planner to help organize your time or downloading an app to track your mood or habits can make it easier to prioritize self-care‚Äîeven if you only have a few minutes a day.

Remember, self-care is about progress, not perfection. The key is finding what works for you and your budget. You deserve to feel your best‚Äîand it‚Äôs totally possible without overspending.

###What is Netflix K-Content?

[Previously known as **The Swoon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFkLnrtVnjc), **Netflix K-Content** channel on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpiCK8c6PBktcxq7Az_t4RQ) is Netflix's official social media handle for Korean content on Netflix. Be it K-dramas, K-movies, K-variety or K-celebs that's where you want to go for official goodies from Netflix. 

(It's also the only acceptable source of previews/teasers for Netflix productions.)

**What is the difference between ""Netflix Original"" and ""produced by Netflix‚Äù?**

**Netflix Original**: Netflix will label any drama they have exclusive streaming rights to in a certain region as an Netflix Original in that region ***even if*** Netflix is only licensing the content and was not part of the production process.

**Produced by Netflix**: these are dramas that Netflix financed and produced (examples include Kingdom, Love Alarm, My Holo Love, Extracurricular).

**Quick tip** to distinguish between a *licensed* Netflix Original and Netflix production: 

> All episodes released on the same day ***worldwide*** = Netflix production

> vs.

> Episodes released weekly concurrent with its airing schedule in Korea ***OR*** the drama finished airing in Korea but is still unavailable on Netflix = a *licensed* Netflix Original

For more info, check out [Netflix‚Äôs Help page on licensing](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/4976) and the article [The Four Types of Netflix Originals](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/the-four-types-of-netflix-originals/).

**Why isn‚Äôt [drama] available even though it‚Äôs airing in Korea?**

***We don‚Äôt know, we‚Äôre not Netflix.***  When (if ever) a drama comes to Netflix for any given region depends on the licensing agreement Netflix has. For more info, check out [Netflix‚Äôs Help page on licensing](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/4976)

**When is [drama] coming to Netflix for my region?**

***We don‚Äôt know, we‚Äôre not Netflix.*** Netflix tells you to keep browsing the [New Arrivals](http://www.netflix.com/browse/new-arrivals) page and looking out for its announcements via [Press Releases](https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases).

**How Good Are Netflix's Subtitles?**

Not great: they often skip over nuances in the language. 

Common example of subtitle inferiority include use of the ***name*** of a character throughout no matter what that character is being called in the dialogue. This can at times be a spoiler if the dialogue was being purposely vague.

Another ***very common*** complaint is that due Netflix subtitles often contain more cursing/profanity in comparison to what is actually being said in the Korean dialogue. This has been speculated to be attributed to Netflix's choices for localization of subtitles. So just be aware that cursing in kdramas, especially ones broadcast on any of the free to air channels (KBS, MBC, SBS) are relatively rare and mild.

**Which Dramas Are Dubbed?**

Based on user feedback, it seems that Netflix offers dubbing only on Netflix productions. See the Netflix help article on [How to use subtitles, captions, or alternate audio](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/372) to change your options.

**What's with the music?**

Background music in kdramas may be altered on streaming platforms in comparison to original broadcast due to copyright and licensing issues. Streaming sites will replace songs with generic choices if they do not have the correct licensing. In general, the songs being switched out are ***not original*** songs created ***solely*** for the drama, instead they are pre-existing songs.

***Longer Answer***

**Note: The explanation below is a very simplified look at a very complex legal issue. Use it for reference, not authority.**

In terms of licensing, each individual song can be thought of as having two sets of legal rights associated with it: publishing rights and recording rights. Publishing rights refers to the rights of the songwriter (or the publishing company that now hold the rights). Recording rights refer to the rights of that specific recording/performance (usually held by the recording company).

> Example to illustrate the point:
>> Think of the [Auld Lang Syne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne) song.

>> The melody is an old Scottish folk song so ***no songwriter can claim publishing rights for it***. People all around the world can use the melody without having to obtain its publishing rights. In fact, it was used as the tune of the [SK national anthem for a few years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegukga).

>> Now imagine that some Singer X made a recording of a specific performance of the song Auld Lang Syne. This specific recording would have recording rights associated with it but no publishing rights associated with it. 

>> If someone wanted to use this recording made by Singer X in a drama as part of the soundtrack, they would need to license the *rights to use this particular recording* (recording rights). They would not need to obtain publishing rights since no songwriter/publishing company has those rights.


**Now for kdramas:**

The music used in kdramas can be one of three types:

> 1. Previously existing songs,

> 2. A specific recording of a previously existing song made just for the drama (such as a remake), or

> 3. A new song written and recorded specifically for the kdrama.


Of these three types, only types 2 and 3 are included in the kdrama‚Äôs OST (original soundtrack) because they were originally *created* for the kdrama.

And of these three types, only type 3 songs are easily licensed for worldwide distribution because both the publishing and recording rights are recently created and generally bundled together with the drama licensing rights.

For type 2 songs, while recording rights may be relatively easy to obtain since the recording was made specifically for the drama, publishing rights may be hard to obtain, especially for worldwide distribution.

For type 1 songs, both publishing and recording rights have to be obtained, making it even harder. Especially if the song is an existing kpop hit song whose international distribution rights are already held by different companies in different regions.


**Now why does Netflix often switch out songs:**

Because the songs switched out are often pre-existing songs that Netflix cannot (or has chosen not to) obtain international licensing rights for. Keep in mind that Netflix is available in ***a lot*** of markets internationally so if they want to license a song, they have to license it for every single market in which this drama will be streamed in. 

So if this drama will be streamed in 20 countries, then Netflix has to obtain song license rights in all 20 countries in order to use it, which can get ***really expensive*** really fast. For songs written and recorded specifically for dramas, licensing is feasible because the song rights are likely bundled with the drama streaming licensing rights, but is near impossible if the song is a pre-existing song with existing distribution deals in different markets. 

> A Hypothetical:

>> **Fire** by BTS was used as the intro song by a character in Fight My Way ([Ïåà ÎßàÏù¥Ïõ®Ïù¥](https://mydramalist.com/22472-fight-for-my-way)).

>> To stream the drama with this song in the USA, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and Brazil, Netflix must obtain the licensing rights for this song in ***all five countries***. If Netflix cannot obtain the correct licensing rights for even ***one of these countries***, then the easiest way to deal with the problem is to switch the song out for some generic tune that they do have the rights for.

>> For a big act like BTS that definitely has different distribution deals in different markets, getting the licensing rights is probably a big challenge (and expense) and likely not worth it from a business standpoint for Netflix. The result is background music being replaced with generic tunes. 

And in case you were wondering, the music problem is not limited to kdrama content, see this [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7145231/shows-not-on-dvd-music-rights-wonder-years-wkrp) article explaining how music licensing rights are a huge headache for older shows now being released on streaming platforms.

I like Van Gogh the most, I like Van Gogh's works the most, I like Van Gogh's paintings the most. I saw the water bottles they sell at Pacific Coffee. The pictures on the outside of the water bottles are paintings by Van Gogh. They are all paintings by Van Gogh. When using the water bottles, you must be very happy when drinking water, drink tastefully, and behave very elegantly.

I don‚Äôt know what you may be feeling right now, but if you‚Äôre here, you‚Äôve already done something good. You have control over your own thoughts and choices. Nothing lasts forever ‚Äî we know that when we say memento mori. Temporary setbacks can last a day, a year, even decades, but remember that you control how you react. If you find yourself feeling lost or hopeless, take control of that thought. Seek out something beautiful or hopeful to engage in.

Life is happening now, and forever is fleeting. Don‚Äôt get stuck on temporary feelings; let them pass and look for the good. Here‚Äôs one final thought: shake up your routine today. Cut out some noise and find a new way to wake up. Try tea instead of coffee and enjoy the fact that you made that choice. Relish in the knowledge that small changes today could set a tone for you to adapt in any situation and at the same time stick to your values! A temporary setback ain‚Äôt shit.

I am not one to enjoy knickknacks, but these are still functional. I like them more than I thought I would. I walk by them and see them as if they‚Äôre waving to me and I wave back. They even reminded me of a few things from my childhood and gave me an idea for a drawing. 

And I had a small manifestation. A few months ago, I was annoyed that flavor of coffee cream I prefer is not carried at my nearest, within walking distance grocery store and that I have to drive across town for it. I know, I know, first world problems. And I don‚Äôt even use it that much - I am more  of a splash of half-and-half in my coffee person. Nonetheless, I did what I knew I needed to do - I imagined vividly and repeatedly being in the nearby store and reaching out to the shelf, grabbing a carton of the flavor I prefer until it felt real. Now and then I would check for it‚Ä¶. And then I gave up‚Ä¶ a few weeks ago, I came across it at another store that requires driving but is significantly closer. I was pleased with that and had a sense of satisfaction. Then today - lo and behold. There it is! It was sitting on the shelf in the nearby store. But I already have some on hand now, LOL.

1gkst1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indianbooks/comments/1gkst1x/are_ereaders_worth_it/,Are e-readers worth it? ,"My options for entertainment were mobile gaming and watching movies/TV series. One year ago, I quit gaming because it felt repetitive. Honestly, there has been hardly any improvement in mobile gaming in the last ten years. I still watch movies and TV series, but only the best ones. To utilize my free time, I built a habit of reading, which has significantly improved my personality over the past year. I became a better person. I read both physical books and ebooks.

When I read ebooks for long durations, I felt digital eye strain. I use glasses with blue light protection, but I was still experiencing eye strain. So I did a little online research and found out that those blue light glasses are worthless. There‚Äôs much more blue light in sunlight than in any digital device. And it does no harm to human eyes! I then discovered the actual reasons for eye strain: when we look at a digital screen, our blinking rate decreases that makes our eyes dry, and our eyes are not adapted to focus on near objects for long periods. That‚Äôs why doctors recommend blinking more and looking at an object at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes to minimize eye strain.

I know e-readers have e-ink technology and feel like paper. But it‚Äôs clear that no e-reader can address these two problems. E-readers may be convenient for reading ebooks. But there are other Android apps and device settings that can provide similar convenience. I know e-reader owners proudly flex their 16k device with a coffee mug and a beautiful background scenery, but are they worth it? Are they cost effective? or is it a marketing gimmick like blue light glasses? ",1,1730877350.0,Indianbooks,5,1.0,False

Got to talk to an old friend.

Exercised. And rolled up so more of my yarn that I have kind of let get out of hand. Have made the decision to add 15 minutes a day of knitting to my life, in an attempt to use the yarn. Friends are probably going to be getting a bunch of coffee warmers and hats.

My mum's best friends were her 2 sisters. They would meet up every week , cook together. They were literally goals.

Now after my mum died, our neighbor , let's call her Catherine tries to claim the whole "" I was her only friend"" title and it makes me mad. 

A little info about Catherine,  she was the other woman in a marriege,  had 2 kids with this man John and after all of that ,he returned to his wife. And now she rents next to me and only her second kid is staying with her , as her oldest has moved in with the dad. 

She knows everyone in the area and everyone knows her. And she loves to gossip. She will never try to get close with you unless there is a benefit.  

After my mum died , and we were all together grieving with my family , she invited her self into my house and sat down with us , again uninvited and started crying on how she was my mum's only best friend and how depressed she was and how this how that. 

And then she told us how important mental health is and that we have to go to a specialist after all of this.

Anyways. 

Moving on the following days my aunts visited us and she again invited herself to my house,  spending my family time to tell her bullcrap again about mental health and at the end she even invited me and my siblings for a movie.

Which at the beginning was very cute but following on. 

A few days later , I was sitting at the porch area and my grandparents who live right across from me  asked me if I wanted to visit them and I said "" not now later "" but the first time  they didn't hear me so I had to shout "" no lateeerrr "" 

And she , Catherine appeared out of nowhere and she told me "" friendly advise? You should built some boundaries with your family "" 

And I was there like üòÄ. 

My response to this was "" please don't take this to heart but you are not part of the family so you can say that kind of stuff."" And she got angry but never said anything. 

Why the whole situation upsets me ? 

1. She has been eyeing my dad after she learned that mum died and I have proof.
2. She is trying to replace her as many times these dates she is asking weird questions like when are your siblings gonna be home etc which she never did before. 
3. She literally told everyone she knows that my mum.died and presented herself as her best friend and started calling people mum would have mentioned once in her life so at the funeral we saw people we didn't call to be there 
4. She doesn't have a green card and stays only here because she gave birth here. 
5. She us super annoying as a person and I don't like her from the moment she moved next to my house. 
6. If she was her best friend , why she didn't attend the funeral ? Why they never got coffee or went foe walks together? Now she remembered her best friend ? 
7. Once she moved next to us she literally would drop her youngest to us because she was working. And my parents didn't want that and once they figure out she is using them , she started dropping the kid to my grandparents.  But they love little kids they couldn't say no.

So after all that am I the a hole for not wanting her at the memorial ? Like she didn't even attend the funeral why being there ? She is going to cry all the time and presenting herself to my family (cousins and other relatives ) as her best friends.

Also am I the a hole that I want to tell her "" NO MY MUM LITERALLY MADE FUN OF YOU WITH HER SISTERS !!!"" ",1,1730877095.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

Rooted in the tranquil yet bustling streets of Tokyo during the 1990s, this unique blend of¬†**lofi music**¬†and¬†**retro Japanese visuals**¬†embodies a distinctive cultural moment, merging elements of anime, city pop, and the daily rhythms of urban life. This article takes a deep dive into the world of 90s lofi Tokyo Japanese, exploring its origins, influences, and lasting impact on music and visual culture.

**The Rise of Lofi Music in Tokyo‚Äôs 90s Scene**

**Defining Lofi Music**

**Lofi**, short for low fidelity, is a genre of music characterized by its imperfect, unpolished sound, often incorporating vinyl crackles, tape hiss, and soft beats. It creates an intimate, relaxing atmosphere, evoking feelings of nostalgia and comfort. In the 1990s, lofi music began to emerge as a counterpoint to the highly produced pop music of the time, embracing simplicity and rawness.

**90s Tokyo: A Melting Pot of Sounds and Styles**

Tokyo in the 90s was a hub of cultural innovation, blending traditional Japanese elements with modern influences. The city was alive with neon lights, bustling streets, and a unique blend of Western and Japanese pop culture. Music, fashion, and art from this era reflect a dynamic, transitional period that has since become iconic.

* **City Pop Resurgence**: The influence of city pop, a genre of Japanese music that emerged in the late 70s and 80s, continued into the 90s, blending smooth jazz, funk, and synth-heavy melodies. Artists like Tatsuro Yamashita and Mariya Takeuchi became cultural icons whose music set the backdrop for Tokyo‚Äôs urban nightlife.
* **Anime and Visuals**: The anime boom of the 90s played a significant role in shaping the lofi aesthetic. Shows like ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" and ""Cowboy Bebop"" featured distinct soundtracks that mixed jazz, blues, and ambient sounds, perfectly capturing the mood of Tokyo‚Äôs streets.

**The Sound of 90s Lofi Tokyo**

Lofi tracks often include samples from old Japanese commercials, anime dialogue, and ambient street sounds, creating a layered soundscape that transports listeners to Tokyo‚Äôs bustling neighborhoods. The result is a musical style that feels both intimately personal and universally nostalgic, blending the laid-back rhythms of lofi with the urban pulse of 90s Tokyo.

**Visual Aesthetics of 90s Lofi Tokyo Japanese**

**Retro Tokyo Imagery**

The visual aesthetics of 90s lofi Tokyo Japanese are marked by nostalgic depictions of Tokyo‚Äôs cityscape. This includes neon-lit alleyways, vintage cars, bustling train stations, and cozy coffee shops. These visuals often evoke a sense of loneliness and tranquility, highlighting the dichotomy of life in a bustling metropolis.

* **Neon Lights and Streetscapes**: Neon signs, busy crosswalks, and late-night diners are common motifs, capturing the vibrant yet serene atmosphere of Tokyo‚Äôs nightlife.
* **Anime and Manga Influences**: Anime visuals are heavily featured in lofi music videos, with clips often taken from classic 90s shows. The soft, grainy quality of VHS tapes adds to the nostalgic feel, reinforcing the connection to the past.

**Fashion and Urban Style**

The 90s were a transformative decade for fashion in Tokyo, with a mix of streetwear, Harajuku style, and minimalist aesthetics dominating the scene. This era‚Äôs fashion is often reflected in lofi visuals, featuring characters in oversized sweaters, denim jackets, and sneakers, encapsulating the effortless cool of 90s Japanese street style.

**The Cultural Impact and Resurgence of 90s Lofi Tokyo Japanese**

**Lofi as a Modern Nostalgia**

The resurgence of 90s lofi Tokyo Japanese music and aesthetics is a testament to its enduring appeal. In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital age, this genre offers a soothing escape, allowing listeners to immerse themselves in a simpler, quieter world. Platforms like YouTube and Spotify have countless lofi playlists featuring visuals of Tokyo‚Äôs retro charm, attracting millions of listeners daily.

**Influence on Contemporary Media**

Modern lofi artists and visual creators continue to draw inspiration from 90s Tokyo, blending vintage elements with contemporary beats. This cross-generational appeal has expanded the reach of 90s lofi, influencing everything from fashion trends to modern anime and indie films. The aesthetic has also permeated social media, with artists and influencers regularly sharing content inspired by the look and feel of 90s Tokyo.

**Why It Resonates Today**

* **Escapism**: The calming, repetitive beats and nostalgic visuals offer a mental escape from the stresses of modern life, transporting audiences to a time and place where life feels more serene.
* **Timeless Appeal**: The fusion of old and new‚Äîblending analog sounds with digital platforms‚Äîmakes 90s lofi Tokyo Japanese both a relic of the past and a relevant part of the present.
* **Connection to Japanese Culture**: For many, this aesthetic provides an accessible entry point into Japanese culture, offering a taste of the country‚Äôs rich artistic history through music and visuals.

**Conclusion**

90s Lofi Tokyo Japanese is more than just a music genre; it‚Äôs a cultural movement that encapsulates the spirit of an era. By combining the mellow beats of lofi music with the nostalgic imagery of 90s Tokyo, it creates a deeply evocative experience that continues to resonate with audiences around the world. Whether you‚Äôre looking to unwind, relive the past, or explore the vibrant culture of Tokyo, this genre offers a beautifully nostalgic escape.

I've never had that, from a young age I've been nervous to become friends with other girls cause I was afraid of judgement, so I grew up around boys. 

I do have two female friends now, and I love them dearly as they've seen my worst and stayed, but recently I realized I wouldn't say they're my best friends. it doesn't feel like we're best friends. the closest thing I've had to a best friend was this girl who moved away years ago (never seen her since) and my current boyfriend. I miss my friend that moved away so much and I've never had a relationship that close to somebody.

Maybe it's just social media shaping my mind, but I crave one of those friendships where we can talk about everything, no matter if you're unsure of what color to paint your nails or how your IBS is acting up. All I want is a friendship with no backstabbing, just pure love and understanding. Singing songs with the windows rolled down, iced coffees and chicken wings,  just girly shit like that.

I don't know how to meet friends nowadays. I work hard to pay my bills and I don't know where to go to meet people, it's not that my conversation skills suck it's jus the leading up to it that kills me. Anybody know anything about this?

Then build an app where users can fill out product research/ market surveys for a chance to win cashback and vouchers. I plan to get audience from newsletter and social media to fill these surveys. Surveys not restricted to MCQs. They can even have 100 words answers.

Results of the surveys can be used for content in newsletter. (Not personal information of course). A lot of content can be created from surveys. For example:

1. Persons from 25 to 30 prefer to drink their first coffee at 8AM.
2. Persons aged 20 more likely to eat ice cream on Saturday.
3. Whats in persons bathroom cabinet?
4. What are current problems with existing businesses and suggestions to improve them.

**Monetization** would be monthly subscription of say Rs. 199 to see survey results. Those who subscribe can also design and send us surveys. Say 5 surveys a month and they can pay further if they want more.

This way, aspiring entrepreneurs will get access to very affordable market research and users get a chance to make some pocket money and they get served better newsletter content. Even fellow content creators on X would be able to use this research when they create content.

Other sources of monetization where I am exploring viability:

* Brand deals and sponsorships on newsletter
* Courses
* Affiliate marketing: amazon, Udemy etc
* Tie up with investment banks/ lenders and refer founders for funding. Take commission.
* Tie up with marketing agencies/ web developers/ law firms to refer founder for respective services they require. Take commission
* Events
* Headhunting/ recruitment services. Refer audience and collect commission from startup.

Can even start this via google forms and to see if this is viable. Results can be shared on monthly basis to premium users.",1,1730875849.0,StartUpIndia,0,1.0,False

I just finished Veilguard with maybe 50 hours in the game and I got the ""bad"" ending where every single companion dies.

I think my expectations were too high and I built this game up in my head too much. That being said, there were a lot of missed opportunities and there was so much potential. Its a good game, but it wasn't the sequel we should have gotten. I liked it, I'll replay and I think fans of the series should play it, at least once, because it has some narrative value but idk, it was not what I was expecting or what I would have created. I did really enjoy it however, as a standalone it would have been brilliant. Here is my Ted Talk:





Things that I liked:

\-I really enjoyed the main plot quests. All of them. I absolutely devoured them up, from start to finish. The start of the game had me absolutely salivating, it looked so good and had exactly the vibes I wanted. Being able to play what we saw in the gameplay trailer (which I loved) had me so hyped. I loved Weisshaupt and seeing the blight. It looked really cool and was fun to playthrough. I loved all the little cut scenes and talks with Solas.

\-I predicted Varric's death (Varric got stabbed by the dagger and didn't get any power when all Harding had to do to become magical was touch it?? And none of the companions went to visit Varric or answers his remarks in cut scenes???) I actually cried when they revealed that I was right and Varric was dead.

\-I liked the soundtrack, it had to grow on me, but I really like it. Especially Emmrich/Nevarra's little theme.

\-All the environments were so stunning, Treviso took my breath away it was so pretty.

\-I liked all the different gear appearance's and the way you could decorate the light house. 10/10.

\-I really like Davrin and Emmrich's personal quests they were so fun and reminiscent of quests in other Dragon Age games. They felt like they belonged in the world. I also liked the murder of crows quest.

\- I love Caterina Dellamorte.

\- The butcher, I liked the quest with him in it and I thought it was a really interesting concept.

\- I really liked hunting down Solas's memories in the fade and the little playable sections, I really appreciated those bits and thought they were fun.

\- The combat was really fun!!! Sometimes it was a little too much, visual's wise, but I liked the skill system.

\-The character creator is fabulous!

\-Manfred and Assan carried.

\-Solas's glow up. They really yassified him.

Things I Wish We Had Seen:

\- More Magisters/The Black Divine (where is all that Tevinter politicking I hear so much about). I wanted to see how the upper class 'vints live. We have heard so much about it but I feel like we literally saw more of that in DA:2 than in Veilguard WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY IN TEVEINTER. I was hoping for a quest where we could free some of the slaves or something (maybe with Fenris) or hear about how the chantry worked in Tevinter. Idk but if this was my first Dragon Age game I would have left not understanding how awful Tevinter culture actually is.

\-More of the chantry. Where are all my revered mothers freaking out and flipping tables that the elven gods are running around blowing stuff up? I love the chantry it's one of my favorite things about the series and yet there was no emphasis put on it at all. If this was my introduction to the series I would have thought that the Chant was a minor religion. We got one convo with Harding about the Maker and that was it.

\-The dalish, I was expecting at least one clan or many clans to side with the gods, they have been waiting for their return for hundreds of years. Here they are, promising elven glory and greatness why not seize it? Or be supporting Solas? Where are all his agents anyway?

\-Better character cameos. I know this would be hard to do without the keep, but it would just make sense for characters like Zevran, Fenris, Merril, Sten, Iron bull or Sera to be in this game. Seeing Antiva without Zevran felt lack luster. I know the Antaam are under Sten's control but do we actually see him at all? Not in my playthrough I didn't. We did see, Morrigan/Mythal, Harding, Varric, Isabella, Dorian, Maevaris and the Inqusitor. Dorian's role was so smallll, and I almost didn't recognize him. We got mentions of Aveline and Sebastian. I kept waiting for Fenris to show up, every time I was in Minrathous, I was like, ""this is going to be it"" and it never was. :(.

\- Fenris again, (I just miss him) If they could add Isabella they could add Fenris. You can literally give her to the Qunari, like you can give Fenris to Tevinter and if Isabella can be in Veilguard in spite (haha) of that choice, Fenris could be in this game in spite of Danarius. We could have had such a cool quest with him, maybe in a dlc. He and Isabella are both DA2 romance options and are possibly given away. If Isabella can be in the game despite the keep Fenris can too. Let me have some closureeee.

Things I did not like :(

\-My ""romance"" with Lucanis. Bro borderline liked me. Mostly it just felt like I was being tolerated. Like we kissed one whole time and he's such a spicy character, but it was not reflected in his romance at all. Actually maybe I did something wring? It said I was locked into a romance with him though. I was a little (devastated actually) disappointed with that romance.

\-Some of the companion dialogue just fell flat, and maybe that's just me, but it could be cringy and not so interesting. Some of the companions even annoyed me a little, which is probably why I didn't complete all their quests and then that's probably why they all died.

\-The tone sometimes felt... weird. Like I don't even know what would cause this but sometimes the vibe was just off. Origins has a specific vibe, DA2 specific vibe, Inquisition has a specific vibe. The vibes in the trilogy are immaculate even though each game is unique. But in this game idk, something felt off. I can't put my finger on it but I can try to describe it. It felt almost spongy, like everyone generally was positive and conflicts got resolved quickly. The game ABSOLUTELY nailed the dark moments it had, it's not that the game was too bright and cheery but idk it never really captured the gritty dragon age feeling. And I don't know why. Other DA games have their jolly moments and dark moments too and yet for some reason this game feels off.

\-Solavellan. I admit it, I went in with a romanced Solas, and I KNOW I GOT THE BAD ENDING but I watched the good one on youtube to make myself feel better and it didn't work. I wish we got to talk to Solas as the Inquisitor, or that their romance had some little nice ending that didn't feel unfinished or like an excuse to keep those characters out of the next game. In the ending I got My Inquisitor didn't even get to talk to Solas so... yeah, I was disappointed.

\- I HATED THE RED LYRIUM BOUNDRIES THOSE THINGS WERE SO ANNOYING. And I did not like how they would be in places where I am sure the people were NOT using red lyrium. Like casually being in the Necropolis.

Other things:

\-The accents, I wish more of the elves had ""elven accents"" I felt like their voices were very ""unelfy"" as sera would probably say. But I did like the design of the elves in this game, they looked much more realistic in this one. Their ears looked good!!!

\- I played as an elf and no one really commented on it. There was one Venatori guy that asked if I was Neve's servant in the quest where you are saving some Dalish elves. But that was it. I was surprised no one in Minrathous had anything to say about it.

\-I saw one Tevinter slave and that was in Nevarra.

\-Did we ever find out how Solas cured the blight from the once ""red lyrium"" now just lyrium dagger?

\-Why does everyone in Thedas love coffee so much now, like yeah me too but I like other things tooo (SIDE EYE LUCANIS)

\- I guess Minstrell Maryden had a massive cultural impact on northern Thedas, because all across the land they are playing her music. And only her music. They are bops though.

\-Ghilan'nain's 'horror' creations looked pretty standard tbh.

\- Did I miss what happened to the other elven gods? Why was it only two of them holding the entire veil down.

\-If the Warden is the Hero of Ferelden, Hawke is the Champion of Kirkwall and The Inquisitor is The Herald of Andraste is Rook ""The Veilguard""?

\-Why was the Black Emporium in some random building in Minrathous, Xenon does not seem like the kind of guy who likes to travel.",1,1730875534.0,DragonAgeVeilguard,0,1.0,False

a little bit ago i started experiencing a new spasm/twitch where my left thumb has started ""seizing,"" that's the word i wanna use for it because it's not just twitching, but there's a seizing sensation in the bottom portion & my thumb then pushes inward or presses against whatever it is i'm holding in my hand, it's a much more noticeable, prominent, and persistent twitch than any other kind i've experienced, but also it doesn't hurt & i seem to have full range of motion

i have ambiguous nerve problems (what seems mostly sensory) that have yet to be medically investigated but nothing majorly serious afaik because i've had those symptoms since i was a kid - i have signs of sciatica (bilateral radiculopathy + degenerative changes in my lumbar spine, nothing massively alarming though) and cubital tunnel syndrome but i don't think those would be affecting my left thumb

i'm on 15mg adderall xr and sometimes drink coffee on top of that, but this seems to happen irrespective of either of those things (& i was once on 40mg of vyvanse without the same effect), usually stimulant stuff just makes my lower eyelid twitch...which is the worst spot ever since it's a blurry movement that i can't look away from when it's happening",1,1730875491.0,MuscleTwitch,0,1.0,False

I'm a very big fan of Black & White Roasters - I lean into ""fruit bombs"" and I always have at least two bags of B&W beans. I'm only a fan, nothing more! If you like B&W, I highly recommend using a subscription from [Bottomless](https://www.bottomless.com/). They have a lot of other roasters in their subscription service but once you start a subscription and get a scale, you can't change it to a different roaster. And I don't know if other roasters offer free shipping (on all orders) and 10% off (also on all orders) like B&W does. So for me, getting free shipping AND 10%, with a roaster I really like, it's a **win, win, win**.

You can read about it on the link but here's a few things that are worth mentioning specific to B&W - not sure if it's like this for every roaster:

* With B&W, you can change your bean default when ever you want. If they run out of something, they ""learn"" your preferences and will replace it for you but you can always change it to what you want. You have **100% control of what beans you order**. You can set your subscription default beans, and put other beans in your queue - it orders what you want and never a surprise bag of coffee.
* You set up your ordering preference (3 options from ""never run out"" through ""it's ok if I run out"") - it learns your usage and will automatically order based on your preferences and usage. They give me about 12 hours notice before a new order will be placed - you can delay that if you want but if you don't adjust it, my order gets placed in the middle of the night (2 AM MST) so you have to change it you get the text saying an order will be placed. Once an order is placed, you can't change anything.
* You can **place a ""one off"" order any time you want**, picking the date you want your beans roasted.
* I usually get my beans (from order placed to in my mailbox) in just under a week - they usually have to sit a couple of days as I try to not open my coffee less than 7 days from roasting. They are in North Carolina, I'm in the Pacific Northwest.

Here's what one of my scales looks like when I look at my subscription. Note it shows I have more than 18 oz of coffee because I just switched to using glass jars that weigh about 12 oz that I vacuum seal so I'll need to reset my scale at some point).

[Subscription home](https://preview.redd.it/vdog60np48zd1.png?width=1593&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1a1467965a7245da12edea92db6840571dfa0e9)

* Top-left is your queue. If you don't have something in your queue, it orders your default (bottom left). If you have something in your queue and it's time to have an order fufilled, they'll take what's in your queue first. I don't use the queue - I have my preferred beans as my default and I I want to order something else, I can do it as a ""one-off"".
* Top right shows your coffee status based on the scale. BTW, the scale is bluetooth and is easy to set up. When you get it, the instructions to do it are very easy.
* Bottom right is order strategy where I have mine set to not run out but also not have a lot of overlap.

When I click on ""Usage Patterns"" there's another screen of data that shows what roast level of coffee I order and geography of beans.

[More details when clicking on Usage Patterns](https://preview.redd.it/o7qndv4w58zd1.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=03d114d7e08dc7ae5f4500bf920cc11c139f4bc3)

There's a daily and monthly usage chart. Since I have two scales and buy other coffees from a local coffee shop, daily isn't that useful but here's my monthly usage for this subscription:

[Monthly usage](https://preview.redd.it/4a431fp668zd1.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=81c0ca2dc503290bbcf1de9e16362bf25601df87)

You can also order one off, whenever you want and still get free shipping and 10% off. If you like B&W, you absolutely should be doing it. No minimum length to the subscription - I'm guessing that if you cancel, they don't want the scale back but I don't know as I've had my two scales for just over a year now.

\- More Magisters/The Black Divine (where is all that Tevinter politicking I hear so much about). I wanted to see how the upper class 'vints live. We have heard so much about it but I feel like we literally saw more of that in DA:2 than in Veilguard WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY IN TEVEINTER. I was hoping for a quest where we could free some of the slaves or something (maybe with Fenris) or hear about how the chantry worked in Tevinter. Idk but if this was my first Dragon Age game I would have left not understanding how awful Tevinter culture actually is.

\-More of the chantry. Where are all my revered mothers freaking out and flipping tables that the elven gods are running around blowing stuff up? I love the chantry it's one of my favorite things about the series and yet there was no emphasis put on it at all. If this was my introduction to the series I would have thought that the Chant was a minor religion. We got one convo with Harding about the Maker and that was it.

\-The dalish, I was expecting at least one clan or many clans to side with the gods, they have been waiting for their return for hundreds of years. Here they are, promising elven glory and greatness why not seize it? Or be supporting Solas? Where are all his agents anyway?

\-Better character cameos. I know this would be hard to do without the keep, but it would just make sense for characters like Zevran, Fenris, Merril, Sten, Iron bull or Sera to be in this game. Seeing Antiva without Zevran felt lack luster. I know the Antaam are under Sten's control but do we actually see him at all? Not in my playthrough I didn't. We did see, Morrigan/Mythal, Harding, Varric, Isabella, Dorian, Maevaris and the Inqusitor. Dorian's role was so smallll, and I almost didn't recognize him. We got mentions of Aveline and Sebastian. I kept waiting for Fenris to show up, every time I was in Minrathous, I was like, ""this is going to be it"" and it never was. :(. 

\- Fenris again, (I just miss him) If they could add Isabella they could add Fenris. You can literally give her to the Qunari, like you can give Fenris to Tevinter and if Isabella can be in Veilguard in spite (haha) of that choice, Fenris could be in this game in spite of Danarius. We could have had such a cool quest with him, maybe in a dlc. He and Isabella are both DA2 romance options and are possibly given away. If Isabella can be in the game despite the keep Fenris can too. Let me have some closureeee. 

Things I did not like :(

\-My ""romance"" with Lucanis. Bro borderline liked me. Mostly it just felt like I was being tolerated. Like we kissed one whole time and he's such a spicy character, but it was not reflected in his romance at all. Actually maybe I did something wring? It said I was locked into a romance with him though. I was a little (devastated actually) disappointed with that romance.

\-Some of the companion dialogue just fell flat, and maybe that's just me, but it could be cringy and not so interesting. Some of the companions even annoyed me a little, which is probably why I didn't complete all their quests and then that's probably why they all died.

\-The tone sometimes felt... weird. Like I don't even know what would cause this but sometimes the vibe was just off. Origins has a specific vibe, DA2 specific vibe, Inquisition has a specific vibe. The vibes in the trilogy are immaculate even though each game is unique. But in this game idk, something felt off. I can't put my finger on it but I can try to describe it. It felt almost spongy, like everyone generally was positive and conflicts got resolved quickly. The game ABSOLUTELY nailed the dark moments it had, it's not that the game was too bright and cheery but idk it never really captured the gritty dragon age feeling. And I don't know why. Other DA games have their jolly moments and dark moments too and yet for some reason this game feels off. 

\-Solavellan. I admit it, I went in with a romanced Solas, and I KNOW I GOT THE BAD ENDING but I watched the good one on youtube to make myself feel better and it didn't work. I wish we got to talk to Solas as the Inquisitor, or that their romance had some little nice ending that didn't feel unfinished or like an excuse to keep those characters out of the next game. In the ending I got My Inquisitor didn't even get to talk to Solas so... yeah, I was disappointed.  

  
\- I HATED THE RED LYRIUM BOUNDRIES THOSE THINGS WERE SO ANNOYING. And I did not like how they would be in places where I am sure the people were NOT using red lyrium. Like casually being in the Necropolis.

  
Other things:

\-The accents, I wish more of the elves had ""elven accents"" I felt like their voices were very ""unelfy"" as sera would probably say. But I did like the design of the elves in this game, they looked much more realistic in this one. Their ears looked good!!!

\- I played as an elf and no one really commented on it. There was one Venatori guy that asked if I was Neve's servant in the quest where you are saving some Dalish elves. But that was it. I was surprised no one in Minrathous had anything to say about it.

\-I saw one Tevinter slave and that was in Nevarra. 

\-Did we ever find out how Solas cured the blight from the once ""red lyrium"" now just lyrium dagger?

\-Why does everyone in Thedas love coffee so much now, like yeah me too but I like other things tooo (SIDE EYE LUCANIS)

\- I guess Minstrell Maryden had a massive cultural impact on northern Thedas, because all across the land they are playing her music. And only her music. They are bops though.

\-Ghilan'nain's 'horror' creations looked pretty standard tbh.

\- Did I miss what happened to the other elven gods? Why was it only two of them holding the entire veil down.

\-If the Warden is the Hero of Ferelden, Hawke is the Champion of Kirkwall and The Inquisitor is The Herald of Andraste is Rook ""The Veilguard""?

\-Why was the Black Emporium in some random building in Minrathous, Xenon does not seem like the kind of guy who likes to travel.



All in all, I don't know what to think. I think my expectations were too high and I built this game up in my head too much. That being said, there were a lot of missed opportunities and there was so much potential. It was a bad game, but it wasn't the game we should have gotten. I liked it, I'll replay and I think fans of the series should play it, at least once, because it has some narrative value but idk, it was not what I was expecting or what I would have created.

 I was a calisthenics fan a few years ago when COVID hit the world and I lost my control over my diet, gaining weight from 78kg to a nice 98 kg. I somehow maintained that weight until my internship where I was mostly active, running around campus doing scut work and regular work as a Medical Intern. However, I was super stressed working insane hours, sometimes 36-40 hours at a stretch, so I began stress eating everyday, gulping down enormous amounts of food making me reach 107.5kg. Over the months it reached 109kg. Once my internship was over, I struggled to control my food habits, to bring it back to my usual level (pre-Covid) for a few months. And finally, it clicked one fine day. Since then(two months ago), I have lost around 7kg and gained some decent strength. That's the story.


How did I do it? (This would maybe work for Indians from South India)

I started eating breakfast regularly, 

Breakfast: 3 small idlis measuring around 100-120g in total along with whatever my mum makes or, pongal 100-150g with mostly sambar.

Morning snack: Early morning coffee(with milk and sugar(1.5 tsp), 10am black coffee(regular coffee on some days)

Lunch: 2 large whole eggs (100-110g total) +/- veggies/chicken. I stopped eating rice for lunch on regular days but would eat it occasionally 

Evening snack: Regular homemade coffee, and an occasional beef/chicken cutlet or something else but only occasionally. Some days, I skip this and drink Black pepsi or Coke zero or the 7up with 2 calories per can.

Dinner: 2 dosai(~130g) or 2 chapathi (~150-160g) and whatever sidedish my mum makes.

Total calories budget: 1600kcal 

Excercise:
Push pull legs split with focus on hypertrophy, adding in a 20min walk after my workout, on the treadmill with 12% incline and 4.5-5.5kmph speed, the goal being a distance of 1.5km usually. Some days, I used to go to 1.6km or even 2km but rarely.

1gkrxie,https://www.reddit.com/r/OveractiveBladder/comments/1gkrxie/help_29_yo_female_with_urgency_for_three_months/,Help! 29 y/o female with urgency for three months ,"I would really love some advice and have previously found reading these forums very helpful. In early August this year, I woke up with sharp pain around my uterus area and feeling of urgency. I've had UTIs in the past so just assumed it was one of those (however I had never had sharp pain before or any pain tbh) so I tried to flush it out and when that didn't work for a couple days, I saw my doctor who took a urine sample and put me on antibiotics. The antibiotics didn't help either and within a few days she said my culture had also come back clear (she also tested for STIs etc). I've had the same partner for 2 years so wasn't worried about that anyway. After about a week and a half the sharp pain subsided and I was just left with the feeling of urgency. In the end, my GP recommended an ultrasound of my ovaries, kidneys, bladder and urethra. Everything came back clear again and they did an additional urine test at the hospital. Throughout this process, I've been tested for UTIs three times and they've all come back clear. My GP recommended for me to see a Urologist and I was put on a waiting list for a month. 

September was actually pretty good, I was feeling relatively normal and would occasionally have a flare up of urgency for 1-2 days (with feelings of pressure as well, like as if I did a whole ab workout) and then the urgency would subside again...So I kept my appointment with the Urologist for early October. The biggest red flag that came out of that appointment was that I drink an excessive amount of water. Before all of this happened, I was drinking an average of 6 Litres a day. For context, most people only drink 2- 3 Litres. I told him that I was quite a deep sleeper and for the last five years I would often wake up in pain in my bladder becuase it was holding my liquid for like 7-8 hours. I'm so dissapointed in myself for not realising this could have detrimental effects on my health but I'm here now! He recommended a blood test to check for diabetes and all clear again. Tbh, it was purely habitual! I just always had my large water bottle near me and would take constant sips throughout the day and into the evening. ANYWAY, He recommended a Cystoscopy as the next step because right around the same time (start of October), the urgency came back and since then until now (4 weeks) I've had it every single day. No other pain or pressure, just urgency. For the most part, it's just incredibly annoying. Like I'd wake up, go to the bathroom and I'm like yep there it is (again!!) In addition to this, I'll get flare ups where like it's overwhelming and debilitating. Like I'm petrified I'm going to wet myself (hasn't happened yet). I'd say they happen 1-2 times a week. 

Anyway, since early October I've started limiting my water inttake and waited for the cystoscopy. I had the full cystoscopy (under anesthetic) in mid-October and the results came back totally clear. Honestly, it sounds strange but I'm so tired of hearing the word 'clear', I just really want some answers :( I ended up seeing another GP who put me in touch with a Pelvic Floor Physiotherapist. She has honestly been amazing with talking me through the bladder signals and how they can get mixed up delivering the correct ones to the brain. She thinks I could possible have 'Over-active Pelvic Floor' also known as 'Hyper-Active Pelvic Floor' or 'OverAactive Bladder'. But!! She did an internal exam and said that my muscles didn't seem under strain and she suggested for me to do kegel exercises to strengthen the bladder. But, they actually make the urgency feel worse! Is that normal? Also, you know the old saying ""you know your body best"". Well, I feel like with the excessive water inntake history, it would make more sense that I have a tight pelvic floor because actually I'm really good at keeping my fluids locked in. I think one day the muscles just couldn't take it anymore and have started contracting. I've read about this thing, called reverse kegels so now I've started doing stretching every evening and I've been trying to do lots of breathing exercises as I've noticed that I'm often sucking in without releasing it. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has a similiar experience to mine and could it actually be something entirely different? I haven't found one article yet that talks about excessive water intake. My GP is still uncertain if it's the culprit and the physio said she has never treated someone with the history of drinking water as a culprit so this is all a bit new for her as well. They both say OAB usually develops from too much caffeeine inttake, alcohol or smoking. I don't drink coffee, energy drinks, non-smoker and alcohol just here and there on the weekends. I also eat well and exercise regularly (I love walking or cardio). I'm really just guilty of over-doing it with water!! Also my Urologist said the cystoscopy showed no evidence of Interstitial cystitis  either. So in summary, it's not a UTI, it's not Interstitial cystitis or a cyst, inflammed lining etc. Also the Urologist had me do a flow test and I void normally so no issue with liquid being left in the bladder either... I'm not typically an anxious person but this whole process is exhausting and I just really really want answers. It's starting to affect my mental health. 

Can anyone speak to this experience? Do you think it could be OAB or should I be exploring other avenues? Also if it is OAB, is it normal to have the urgency every day and then every so often short periods of debilitating urgency that last a few hours? Or is it more consistent than that? I'd really love some advice, thank you so much! Finding this forum so helpful.",1,1730873880.0,OveractiveBladder,0,0.99,False
