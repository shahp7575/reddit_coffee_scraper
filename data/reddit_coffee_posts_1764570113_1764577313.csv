1pb7b4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackFridayDealsList/comments/1pb7b4d/best_coffee_espresso_machine_cyber_monday_deals/,"Best Coffee & Espresso Machine Cyber Monday Deals 2025 — Breville Barista Express $499, Keurig 45% Off, Nespresso Under $85","Coffee machine deals just hit yearly lows and the discounts across every category are genuinely impressive. The Breville Barista Express — literally the #1 best seller in semi-automatic espresso machines — dropped to $499. Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ fell 47% to $84. The Keurig K-Express is sitting at $59. Even the De'Longhi Rivelia fully automatic lost nearly $500. From pod machines to prosumer espresso setups, everything is on sale.

Here's what people mess up when buying coffee equipment: matching the machine to how you actually drink coffee. A $500 espresso machine is wasted on someone who drinks one rushed cup before work — get a Keurig or Nespresso. Conversely, buying a pod machine when you want real espresso with crema leads to disappointment. The right machine for YOUR routine matters more than the ""best"" machine on paper. Also, grinders matter as much as machines for espresso — fresh ground beans dramatically change shot quality.

Went through 23 coffee machine listings, verified prices, cross-referenced reviews. These cover everything from $59 single-serve to $1,019 fully automatic — organized by machine type so nobody buys espresso equipment when they wanted drip coffee.

# Helpful Notes

**Pod vs Espresso vs Drip — Which Is Right?**

Pod machines (Keurig, Nespresso): Fastest, most convenient, consistent. Trade-off: ongoing pod cost, less control, not ""real"" espresso. Best for: busy mornings, convenience priority, casual coffee drinkers.

Drip coffee makers: Best for large quantities, classic American coffee. Trade-off: not espresso, requires ground coffee. Best for: families, offices, multiple cups.

Semi-automatic espresso (Breville, De'Longhi): Real espresso with crema, milk texturing capability. Trade-off: learning curve, cleanup, time investment. Best for: home baristas, latte/cappuccino lovers, coffee enthusiasts.

Fully automatic espresso (Philips, De'Longhi Rivelia): Bean-to-cup with one button. Trade-off: expensive, less control, complex machines. Best for: espresso lovers who want convenience.

**Grinder Importance:** For espresso, grind quality matters as much as the machine. The Breville Barista Express includes a grinder — convenient all-in-one. If buying a Bambino or Dedica, budget for separate grinder (Baratza or Breville at $159). Pre-ground coffee works but fresh-ground is noticeably better.

**Nespresso Original vs Vertuo:** Original line: smaller espresso-style shots, third-party pod options Vertuo line: larger coffee and espresso sizes, Nespresso pods only

Most deals here are Vertuo — better for American-style larger coffees plus espresso option.

**Steam Wand vs Automatic Frother:** Steam wands (Breville Bambino, De'Longhi) require learning microfoam technique — more control, steeper learning curve. Automatic frothers (Breville Barista Touch, Ninja machines) texture milk automatically — consistent results, less skill needed.

**Bar Pressure Marketing:** 15-bar and 20-bar are marketing numbers. Actual extraction happens at 9 bars. Higher numbers don't mean better espresso. Focus on build quality and temperature stability instead.

# Skip These If...

* **Skip Keurig** if coffee quality matters most — pods are convenient but not premium coffee
* **Skip Nespresso** if you hate ongoing pod costs — pods add up, can't use regular beans
* **Skip De'Longhi Classic at $127** if you won't learn espresso basics — there's a learning curve
* **Skip Breville Bambino** if you don't have a grinder — need separate grinder purchase, adds $150+
* **Skip Breville Barista Express** if you want fully automatic — it's semi-automatic, requires involvement
* **Skip Ninja machines** if pure espresso quality is priority — versatile but not espresso-focused
* **Skip Breville Barista Touch** if budget is concern — Barista Express at $499 does 90% of the job
* **Skip De'Longhi Rivelia at $1,019** unless fully automatic is must-have — expensive for what it does
* **Skip Fellow Aiden at $319** unless you're a specialty coffee nerd — overkill for regular drip coffee
* **Skip all espresso machines** if you drink one quick cup before rushing out — get Keurig or Nespresso instead

The coffee machine market has something for everyone, and Cyber Monday prices make this the best time to upgrade. The key is matching the machine to your actual coffee routine — not buying the ""best"" machine that sits unused because it's too complicated for your 6 AM rush.

For most people who just want good coffee fast, the **Keurig K-Express at $59** or **Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ at $84** are the moves. Pod coffee has improved dramatically, and 45-47% off makes these impulse-buy territory. If you want milk drinks from pods, the **Nespresso VertuoPlus with Frother at $142** is the complete package.

For drip coffee households, the **Cuisinart 14-Cup at $65** being 45% off and #1 best seller is a no-brainer — programmable means coffee is ready when you wake up.

If you're ready to commit to real espresso, the **Breville Barista Express at $499** remains the gold standard for all-in-one home espresso. There's a reason it's #1 best seller with 26K+ reviews — built-in grinder, quality shots, capable steam wand. The learning curve exists but the community support is massive.

Budget espresso seekers should look at the **De'Longhi Classic at $127** — 45% off and from a proven brand. Add the **Baratza Encore ESP at $159** for fresh grinding and you're at \~$290 for a legitimate espresso setup.

For those who want espresso quality without the effort, the **De'Longhi Rivelia at $1,019** dropping 32% is significant — fully automatic means bean-to-cup with one button, though the price tag requires serious coffee commitment.

1pb7b1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1pb7b1z/i_realized_my_remote_work_routine_slowly_turned/,"I realized my remote work routine slowly turned me into a completely different kind of productive human, and honestly I did not expect that at all","No drama here, just one weird discovery that kinda changed how I work every day.    
So a few months ago I started  doing this tiny experiment. Before opening my laptop I sit for 3 mins and just write down what  my brain is already thinking about. No goals, no morning motivation, nothing like that . Most days it looked like random junk. Stuff like fix the squeaky chair or why is my coffee machine  louder than my dog. But week after week I noticed something very strange. Every time  I let my brain dump all this noise first thing in the morning, the rest of my day was smoother. Meetings felt less heavy, I stopped randomly doomscrolling during tasks and my  focus kinda clicked into place.

The funny part is that this only works  in remote mode. When I tried it once in an office day the whole thing felt off. People walking around, someone reheating fish, the usual office chaos. At home the silence makes that little  ritual feel like powering up. And when I skip it even for a day, my mind feels like a tab with  40 open windows that refuses to close any of them.   
Im not trying to sell this as productivity  advice or anything. Just sharing because remote work gives us weird freedoms to experiment with ourselves. Some folks take walks, some cook breakfast, some do yoga. Apparently I just  need to brain-dump like a confused goldfish before I can be a functional adult. If anyone else has weird tiny rituals that help you survive remote life, I kinda wanna hear them. Maybe mine is  not the strangest one out there.",1,1764576898.0,remotework,0,1.0,False

# Where is Chopta? Location, Altitude & Trek Overview

Chopta is a picturesque and unspoiled region nestled in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, India. It's renowned for its breathtaking natural beauty, encompassing vast emerald meadows and dense evergreen forests. Often referred to as a hidden paradise, it serves as the base for some of the most famous treks in the Garhwal Himalayas, making it a popular choice for a **Chopta tour** for nature lovers and adventure enthusiasts alike.

# Location and Geographical Overview

Chopta is situated amidst the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, making it a hotspot for rich flora and fauna. The region is dotted with forests primarily comprising pine, deodar, and rhododendron trees, which burst into vibrant colors during spring. Its strategic location offers mesmerizing panoramic views of towering Himalayan peaks, including the formidable Chaukhamba, Nanda Devi, and Trishul.

* **District:** Rudraprayag, Uttarakhand, India
* **Part of:** Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary
* **Surroundings:** Lush green meadows (Bugyals), dense forests, and clear views of prominent Himalayan ranges. It's an important bird-watching site, attracting various native and migratory bird species.

# Altitude

Chopta sits at a significant elevation, contributing to its cool climate and stunning vistas.

* **Chopta Village Altitude:** Approximately 2,608 meters (8,556 feet) above sea level.
* **Tungnath Temple Altitude:** Located at about 3,680 meters (12,073 feet), it's the highest Shiva temple in the world.
* **Chandrashila Peak Altitude:** The summit reaches around 4,000 meters (13,123 feet), offering a 360-degree view of the surrounding peaks.

This elevation ensures pleasant weather for most of the year, although winters bring heavy snowfall, transforming the landscape into a white wonderland.

# Trek Overview: The Gateway to Tungnath & Chandrashila

Chopta is most famously known as the starting point for the holy Tungnath Trek and the further ascent to Chandrashila Peak. These treks are generally considered moderate, making them accessible even for beginners with decent physical fitness.

* **Chopta to Tungnath:** This is a 3.5 km trek, largely paved with stone steps, leading to the ancient Tungnath Temple. The trail winds through beautiful meadows and rhododendron bushes.
* **Tungnath to Chandrashila:** An additional 1.5 km climb from Tungnath takes you to the Chandrashila summit. While steeper, the effort is amply rewarded with awe-inspiring views.

Many visitors opt for a Chopta tour package that includes this famous trek, often combined with a visit to the serene Deoria Tal lake. These Chopta tour packages typically handle accommodation (often in Swiss tents or guesthouses in Chopta), meals, and sometimes transportation, allowing travelers to focus entirely on the trekking experience and the natural beauty. Whether you're planning a short getaway or a longer exploration, a Chopta tour promises a rejuvenating and spiritually enriching experience in the lap of the Himalayas.



# How to Reach Chopta – Travel Routes from Delhi, Rishikesh & Haridwar

Reaching Chopta, the tranquil base for the famous Tungnath and Chandrashila treks, requires a journey deep into the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand. While there's no direct train or flight to Chopta itself, the region is well-connected by road from major cities like Delhi, Haridwar, and Rishikesh. The travel is part of the experience, offering scenic routes through winding mountain roads. Many travelers opt for a pre-arranged Chopta tour package from Delhi to handle the logistics smoothly.

# From Delhi to Chopta

Traveling from Delhi to Chopta is typically an overnight journey by road, covering approximately 400-450 km.

* **By Road (Direct Taxi/Self-Drive):**
   * This is the most flexible option. A private taxi can take you directly from Delhi to Chopta. The journey takes around 9-12 hours, depending on traffic and road conditions.
   * **Route:** The most common route is Delhi – Ghaziabad – Meerut – Haridwar – Rishikesh – Devprayag – Srinagar – Rudraprayag – Ukhimath – Chopta. The drive through Devprayag, Srinagar, and Rudraprayag is particularly scenic, following the Alaknanda River.
   * For a Chopta Tungnath trek from Delhi or Chopta Chandrashila trek from Delhi, many tour operators offer comfortable AC tempo travellers or buses, providing a hassle-free journey with stops for meals and refreshments.
* **By Bus (Indirect):**
   * You can take an overnight bus from Delhi (ISBT Kashmere Gate) to Haridwar, Rishikesh, or Dehradun.
   * From these cities, you'll need to arrange onward travel to Chopta (see details below). This option is more budget-friendly but requires more coordination.
* **By Train (Indirect):**
   * The nearest major railway stations are Haridwar Junction (approx. 225 km from Chopta), Rishikesh Railway Station (approx. 209 km), and Dehradun Railway Station (approx. 220 km).
   * **From Delhi:** Regular trains like Shatabdi Express, Jan Shatabdi, or overnight express trains connect Delhi to Haridwar, Rishikesh, and Dehradun. The train journey takes about 4-7 hours.
   * Upon reaching any of these stations, you'll then hire a taxi or find shared jeeps/buses to Chopta.
* **By Air (Indirect):**
   * The nearest airport is Jolly Grant Airport (DED) in Dehradun, approximately 220 km from Chopta.
   * **From Delhi:** Flights from Delhi to Dehradun take about an hour.
   * From Dehradun airport, you can hire a private taxi directly to Chopta, which takes around 7-8 hours. This is the fastest overall option for those short on time.

# From Rishikesh & Haridwar to Chopta

Once you reach Rishikesh or Haridwar, your journey to Chopta continues by road.

* **By Taxi (Recommended):**
   * Hiring a private taxi is the most convenient and common way to reach Chopta from Rishikesh (approx. 165 km, 5-6 hours) or Haridwar (approx. 200 km, 6-7 hours). Taxis are readily available and can be booked for one-way or round trips. This is often included in Chopta tour packages.
   * Shared cabs are also an option from major taxi stands, especially in Rishikesh, but they might take longer as they wait for passengers.
* **By Bus (Local/Shared):**
   * Direct public buses to Chopta are scarce. You'll typically find buses from Rishikesh or Haridwar to Ukhimath or Rudraprayag.
   * From Ukhimath (approx. 40 km from Chopta) or Rudraprayag (approx. 60 km from Chopta), you'll need to hire a local taxi or shared jeep to reach Chopta. This is the most economical but least convenient option.

Many Chopta tour packages streamline this process by providing direct pick-up and drop-off from Delhi, Rishikesh, or Haridwar, ensuring a comfortable and stress-free start to your Chopta Tungnath trek from Delhi or Chopta Chandrashila trek from Delhi.



# Best Time to Do the Trek – Weather & Seasonal Tips

The Chopta Tungnath trek, including the climb to Chandrashila Peak, feels different depending on the time of year. Each season has its own kind of weather and amazing views. Knowing what to expect will help you pick the best time for your chopta chandrashila trek and get ready.

# 1. Spring (March to April): Flowers Blooming & Snow Melting

* **Weather:** It's a changing time. In early March, there might still be a lot of snow, especially on the path to Tungnath and Chandrashila. As April comes, the snow melts, showing green fields. The weather slowly gets warmer, from cool to pleasant (around 0°C to 18°C).
* **Views:** The best part of spring is when the rhododendron flowers bloom. They make the forests look red and pink. You can get very clear views of the snow-covered Himalayas.
* **Tips:** If you trek in early March, be ready for snow and slippery spots, especially near Tungnath and Chandrashila. Waterproof trekking shoes are a good idea. When snow melts, paths can be a bit muddy.

# 2. Summer (May to June): Nice Weather & Green Everywhere

* **Weather:** This is usually the most popular time for the Chopta Tungnath trek. The weather is generally nice and mild (10°C to 28°C), with clear skies. It's perfect for comfortable walking.
* **Views:** Everything is super green. You get wide, open views of the valleys and big Himalayan mountains.
* **Tips:** Great for families and beginners. The paths are dry and easy to walk on. Book your place to stay early, as it's a busy time.

# 3. Monsoon (July to August): Very Green But Can Be Tricky

* **Weather:** Chopta gets a lot of rain during these months. It's still mild (15°C to 25°C), but it's humid.
* **Views:** The hills become incredibly green, and clouds often come down, making everything look misty and magical. Waterfalls are full.
* **Tips:** It's beautiful, but it can be tough. Paths get slippery and muddy, so you might slip. Roads can also get blocked by landslides. Good rain gear and walking sticks are a must. It's usually not the best for beginners because the conditions can change quickly. The Tungnath Temple might also be hard to reach.

# 4. Autumn (September to November): Fresh Air & Amazing Views

* **Weather:** After the monsoon, the sky clears up, and the air becomes fresh and cool (6°C to 20°C). It's much less humid.
* **Views:** This time offers some of the most amazing and clear views of the Himalayas. The air is clean, and you can see far. The green changes a bit, sometimes turning golden as winter gets closer.
* **Tips:** Excellent time for taking photos and walking when it's dry and comfortable. Nights start to get cold, so wear layers.

# 5. Winter (December to February): Snow Heaven & Tougher Walk

* **Weather:** Chopta turns into a snowy wonderland. It gets very cold, often below freezing, especially at night (can be -5°C to -15°C). Lots of snow usually falls, particularly in January.
* **Views:** The whole place is covered in fresh white snow, making it look dreamlike and beautiful. The snow-covered mountains look even more grand.
* **Tips:** This season is for adventurous beginners who are ready for a challenge. The Chopta Tungnath trek and Chopta Chandrashila trek become much harder with deep snow and slippery paths. You'll need special gear like waterproof, high boots, warm clothes, and maybe special grips for your shoes (microspikes). It's best to go with a guide. The Tungnath Temple is usually closed in deep winter, and sometimes roads to Chopta are blocked by heavy snow.

  
ermits, Fees & Responsible Trekking Guidelines

Going on the Tungnath Chandrashila trek from Delhi is an exciting trip! But before you go, it's really important to know about any permissions or costs, and most importantly, how to behave responsibly. This way, your trip is not just fun, but also helps keep the beautiful Himalayas clean and safe for everyone.

# What About Permissions & Money?

For the Tungnath Temple trek, you usually don't need a special ""permit"" if you're an Indian citizen and going during good weather. But there are a few things to keep in mind for 2025:

* **Forest Entry Fees:** Chopta is inside the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary. So, you might need to pay a small fee to the forest department at certain spots. This is usually a small amount per person, and sometimes a little extra for cameras. If you book your tungnath chandrashila trek from delhi with a tour company, these fees are usually already covered in your package.
* **Guide Costs:** You don't have to hire a guide for the first part of the trek (Chopta to Tungnath) when the weather is good. But it's a really good idea, especially if you're going to the Chandrashila trek or if there's snow. A guide keeps you safer, knows a lot about the area, and can help if something unexpected happens. They don't cost too much.
* **Porter/Mule Charges:** If you don't want to carry your heavy bags, you can hire a porter or a mule in Chopta. Their cost depends on how much your bag weighs and how far you're going.
* **Where You Stay:** The cost of your camp, guesthouse, or hotel in Chopta is part of your total trip cost. Many tungnath chandrashila trek from delhi packages include this.

Always double-check the latest fees with local officials or your tour operator, as rules can change.

# Be a Good Trekker: Simple Rules to Follow

The Chopta area is a truly special and clean natural place. It's super important to be a responsible tourist so we can protect its beauty and spiritual feeling for the future.

* **Don't Leave Anything Behind:** This is the most important rule. Whatever you bring with you – food wrappers, plastic bottles, anything that doesn't naturally break down – you must take it back down the mountain. Don't leave any trash on the paths or at campsites.
* **Bathroom Breaks:** If you need to go to the toilet, dig a small hole far away from water, paths, and campsites, and then cover it up properly.
* **Leave Things As They Are:** Don't pick up rocks, plants, or anything natural. Just enjoy looking at them.
* **Be Nice to Animals:** Watch wildlife from a distance. Don't feed them, as it's bad for their health and makes them rely on people.
* **Be Quiet:** Keep noise down. Loud music or shouting can disturb animals and other trekkers who want peace.
* **Stay on Paths:** Don't walk off the marked trails. This helps prevent dirt from washing away and protects the plants.
* **Save Water and Power:** Be smart with how much water and electricity you use at your guesthouse or camp.
* **Respect Locals:**
   * **Culture:** Dress politely, especially near temples like Tungnath. Take off your shoes before going into the temple.
   * **Support:** Buy things from local shops or stay in local homestays to help the people who live there.
   * **Photos:** Always ask for permission before taking pictures of local people.

By following these simple rules, every person trekking helps keep the environment clean and the spiritual feeling strong in the Himalayas.



# Local Food & Water – What’s Available on the Trek?

When you embark on a Tungnath Chandrashila trek from Delhi, especially for beginners, understanding what to expect regarding food and water along the trail is crucial. While Chopta, the base, offers more options, facilities become sparser as you ascend towards Tungnath and Chandrashila.

# Food Availability on the Trek

The food available on the Chopta Tungnath trek is generally simple, hearty, and geared towards providing energy for the climb.

* **In Chopta (Base Camp):**
   * **Guesthouses/Campsites:** Most Chopta Tungnath trek package and Chopta Chandrashila trek package deals include meals at your accommodation in Chopta. These usually consist of basic but wholesome Indian vegetarian food: dal (lentils), rice, roti (flatbread), seasonal vegetables, and sometimes eggs.
   * **Local Dhabas/Eateries:** You'll find a few small eateries or dhabas in Chopta village. They serve similar simple meals, along with popular snacks like Maggi noodles, parathas, and pakoras (fritters). Hot tea and coffee are readily available.
   * **Local Delicacies:** If you're lucky, some places might offer local Garhwali dishes like 'Aloo Ke Gutke' (spicy boiled potatoes), 'Phaanu' (lentil stew), or 'Kafuli' (spinach curry).
* **On the Trail to Tungnath:**
   * As you start the 3.5 km trek from Chopta to Tungnath, you'll find a few small tea stalls and basic food shacks along the way, especially during peak season.
   * They primarily offer:
      * **Maggi Noodles:** The ubiquitous trekker's favorite.
      * **Tea, Coffee, and Cold Drinks:** Basic beverages.
      * **Packaged Snacks:** Biscuits, chips, chocolates.
      * **Occasional Parathas or Omlettes:** Very basic and limited cooked food.
   * **Near Tungnath Temple:** Just before reaching the temple, there are a couple of small shops/dhabas where you can get tea, coffee, Maggi, and sometimes simple meals like dal-chawal (lentils and rice) during peak season. These are very basic.
* **On the Trail to Chandrashila Peak:**
   * From Tungnath to Chandrashila (1.5 km), there are generally no food stalls or shops. It's a continuous ascent to the summit.
   * **Recommendation:** It is highly advisable to carry packed snacks (energy bars, dry fruits, nuts, chocolates) for your push to Chandrashila.

# Water Availability on the Trek

Staying hydrated is crucial for a high-altitude trek.

* **In Chopta:**
   * Your accommodation will provide safe drinking water.
   * Bottled water is readily available for purchase at shops in Chopta.
* **On the Trail to Tungnath:**
   * You'll find bottled water for sale at the small shops along the Tungnath trail.
   * **Natural Water Sources:** The Himalayas are known for natural spring water. While many trekkers drink directly from streams, especially higher up, it's always safer to carry a water filter/purifier or purification tablets if you plan to rely on natural sources. Always ask your guide or locals about the potability of any specific stream water.
* **On the Trail to Chandrashila:**
   * **No water sources available** between Tungnath and Chandrashila.
   * **Recommendation:** Carry at least 1-2 liters of water per person from Chopta or Tungnath before starting the final ascent to Chandrashila.

**General Tips:**

* **Carry Your Own Snacks:** Even if your chopta tungnath trek package includes meals, always carry some energy bars, dry fruits, and chocolates for quick boosts on the trail.
* **Reusable Water Bottle:** Carry a reusable water bottle to reduce plastic waste.
* **Winter Season:** During winter, many dhabas and shops on the trail close down. If you're undertaking the chandrashila trek in winter, you *must* carry all your food and hot water/thermos from Chopta.



# What to Pack for the Chopta Tungnath Trek (Beginner Essentials)

Packing correctly is crucial for a comfortable and safe Tungnath Temple trek and the challenging Chandrashila Summit trek, especially for beginners. The weather in the Himalayas can change quickly, so layering and preparedness are key. Here's an essential packing list to ensure you're ready for your adventure in 2025:

# 1. Clothing (Layering is Essential)

The golden rule for mountain trekking is layering. This allows you to adjust your clothing based on temperature changes throughout the day.

* **Base Layers (Thermals):** 2-3 pairs (top and bottom). Choose moisture-wicking synthetic or merino wool to keep you dry by pulling sweat away from your body.
* **Mid-Layers (Fleece Jackets/Sweaters):** 1-2 warm fleece jackets or woolen sweaters. These provide insulation and warmth.
* **Outer Layer (Waterproof & Windproof Jacket):** A good quality, waterproof and windproof jacket is a must. It protects you from rain, snow, and chilly winds. A poncho can also be a lightweight alternative for rain.
* **Trekking Pants:** 2 pairs of comfortable, quick-drying trekking pants. Avoid jeans as they are heavy and slow to dry.
* **Socks:** 3-4 pairs of synthetic or wool trekking socks (avoid cotton, which retains moisture). One pair of thick woolen socks for evenings or cold weather.
* **Undergarments:** A few pairs of comfortable underwear.
* **Warm Hat/Beanie:** Essential for retaining body heat, especially in cold mornings or evenings.
* **Gloves:** 1 pair of woolen gloves for warmth and 1 pair of waterproof outer gloves if expecting rain or snow.
* **Scarf/Buff:** To protect your neck and face from wind and cold.

# 2. Footwear

Your feet are your most important tools on a trek!

* **Trekking Shoes:** High-ankle, waterproof trekking shoes with good grip are crucial. Ensure they are well broken-in before your trip to avoid blisters.
* **Slippers/Sandals:** For use around your campsite or guesthouse in Chopta.

# 3. Backpack & Accessories

* **Backpack (Rucksack):** A comfortable 40-60 liter backpack with good padding and support. Make sure it has a rain cover.
* **Daypack:** A smaller 10-20 liter daypack is useful for the summit day (Chandrashila summit trek) if you leave your main luggage at the Chopta base.
* **Trekking Poles:** Highly recommended for stability, especially on ascents and descents, and to reduce strain on your knees.
* **Headlamp/Torch:** With extra batteries. Essential for early morning starts or navigating in the dark.
* **Water Bottle/Hydration Bladder:** At least 1-2 liter capacity. Stay hydrated!
* **Sunglasses:** UV-protected sunglasses are vital to protect your eyes from harsh sunlight and snow glare (especially important in winter for the tungnath temple trek).
* **Sun Cap/Hat:** For sun protection during the day.

# 4. Personal Care & Health

* **Sunscreen (SPF 50+):** The sun's intensity is much higher at altitude.
* **Lip Balm (with SPF):** To prevent chapped lips.
* **Moisturizer:** The dry mountain air can dry out your skin.
* **Hand Sanitizer & Wet Wipes:** For hygiene, especially when water is scarce.
* **Toiletries:** Toothbrush, toothpaste, small quick-dry towel, toilet paper (crucial for outdoor use).
* **Basic First-Aid Kit:** Band-aids, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, blister pads, anti-inflammatory spray/gel, any personal medications.
* **Personal Medications:** If you have any specific health conditions.

# 5. Other Essentials

* **Power Bank:** Electricity can be intermittent; keep your phone and camera charged.
* **Camera:** To capture the stunning views! (with extra batteries/memory card).
* **ID Proof:** Original and photocopy of a government-issued ID (e.g., Aadhar Card, Driving License).
* **Snacks:** Energy bars, dry fruits, nuts, chocolates for quick energy boosts on the trail.

Remember to pack light but smart. Every extra kilogram will feel heavier on the trek.



# Chopta Tungnath Trek Cost – Budget Breakdown for Beginners

Planning a Chandrashila trek from Delhi means figuring out the costs involved. For beginners, it's helpful to break down the expenses so you know what to expect, whether you're booking one of the many Chopta tour packages or planning a DIY trip.

Here's a budget breakdown for a typical Chopta Tungnath Chandrashila trek:

# 1. Transportation

This is often the biggest cost, especially if you're traveling from Delhi.

* **From Delhi (Round Trip):**
   * **Shared Cab/Tempo Traveller:** This is the most common and cost-effective option if you're not booking a full package. Expect to pay around ₹2,500 - ₹4,000 per person for a round trip from Delhi to Chopta. This is often included in chopta tour packages from delhi.
   * **Private Taxi:** More comfortable but pricier. A private taxi from Delhi to Chopta and back could cost ₹8,000 - ₹12,000 for the vehicle, depending on the type of car and duration (usually for 3-4 days). This is better for small groups who can split the cost.
   * **Train/Bus to Rishikesh/Haridwar + Local Transport:** A more budget-friendly approach involves taking a train or bus to Rishikesh or Haridwar (₹300 - ₹1,000 one-way) and then hiring a shared or private taxi to Chopta (₹1,500 - ₹3,000 for a shared taxi from Rishikesh/Haridwar, or ₹3,000 - ₹5,000 for a private one-way).

# 2. Accommodation

Your stay in Chopta can range from basic to comfortable.

* **Camps/Guesthouses in Chopta:**
   * **Basic Camps/Dorms (Shared Basis):** ₹800 - ₹1,500 per person per night, usually including basic meals (dinner and breakfast).
   * **Swiss Tents/Cottages (Twin/Triple Sharing):** ₹1,500 - ₹3,000 per person per night, offering more comfort and amenities.
* Most chopta tour packages will include 2 nights' accommodation in Chopta.

# 3. Food & Water

* **Meals at Chopta:** If not included in your package, a simple meal at a local dhaba might cost ₹200 - ₹400 per person per meal.
* **On-Trek Snacks:** While there are small shops on the Tungnath trail for Maggi, tea, and packaged snacks (expect slightly higher prices due to remote location, e.g., ₹50-80 for Maggi, ₹30-50 for tea), it's wise to carry your own energy bars, dry fruits, and chocolates (₹300 - ₹500 for a trip's supply).
* **Water:** Bottled water in Chopta will cost ₹20-30. On the trek, it might be ₹40-60. Consider carrying a reusable bottle and purification tablets to save money and reduce plastic waste.

# 4. Trekking Related Costs

* **Forest Entry Fees:** A nominal fee might be charged (around ₹50-₹150 for Indian nationals, higher for foreigners) at the sanctuary entrance. Usually included in chopta tour packages.
* **Guide (Optional but Recommended):** For beginners, especially for the chandrashila trek, a guide is highly recommended for safety and local insights. A guide for the Tungnath-Chandrashila trek typically costs ₹1,500 - ₹2,500 per day. If you're in a group, this cost gets divided.
* **Porter/Mule (Optional):** If you want to offload your backpack, a porter might charge ₹500 - ₹800 per day.
* **Gear Rental (If Needed):** Trekking poles (₹50-₹100/day), warm jackets, or shoes if you don't own them.

# 5. Miscellaneous & Personal Expenses

* **Personal Shopping:** Souvenirs, local handicrafts if available.
* **Emergency Buffer:** Always carry an extra ₹1,000 - ₹2,000 for unforeseen expenses like medical emergencies or road blockages.

# Typical Budget Range

For a 2-night/3-day Chopta Tungnath Chandrashila trek from Delhi:

* **Budget (DIY/Backpacking):** ₹6,000 - ₹8,000 per person (using shared transport, basic stays, minimal guide use).
* **Mid-Range (Tour Package):** ₹7,500 - ₹12,000 per person. Many chopta tour packages fall into this range, including transport from Delhi, accommodation, basic meals, and a guide.
* **Premium (Comfort/Private):** ₹12,000+ per person (private transport, better accommodation, private guide).

These are approximate costs for 2025. Prices can fluctuate based on the season (peak season like May-June or during snow sees higher prices), type of accommodation chosen, and how many people are in your group. Booking in advance, especially with a well-planned chopta tour package, can often get you better deals.

clearly marked as ""prop money"" and ""not legal tender"" and the customer reviews are absolutely
sending me. People are leaving the most unhinged feedback about these fake bills. I can't stop
reading them. The 1000 euro banknote listings are wild because the euro doesn't even have a
1000 denomination in real circulation. These are completely fantasy bills that don't exist in any
official capacity. But they look official enough that multiple reviews mention people trying to use
them accidentally and getting in trouble. One guy said his friend tried to pay for groceries with a
1000 euro banknote from this batch and nearly got arrested before explaining it was movie prop
money. Another person said they left them on their coffee table and their roommate thought they
were rich. I'm not buying these props because I have no legitimate use for them and don't want
to accidentally commit fraud but I'm fascinated by who IS buying them. The sellers have
thousands of orders. What are people doing with fake banknote bills? Making movies? Pranking
friends? Teaching financial literacy classes? The legitimate uses seem extremely limited. The
funniest reviews are from people who seem genuinely confused about whether these banknote
replicas are real money. One person asked in the Q&A section ""can I use these at stores"" and
the seller replied ""NO THIS IS PROP MONEY ONLY"" in all caps. Another review said ""looks real
but cashier rejected it"" like they were genuinely surprised by this outcome. Some listings show
the props next to real bills for comparison and they're shockingly accurate in the photos. The
paper texture is supposedly different and they have ""REPLICA"" printed in small text, but from a
distance they'd probably fool people. That's concerning but also impressive from a
manufacturing standpoint. I shared this discovery with friends and now we're all browsing weird
prop money listings on Alibaba. There are fake dollars, pounds, even ancient Roman coins. The

Oral care is one thing I pay extra attention to since long workdays, hotel coffee, and late dinners never do my teeth any favors.

I got this mainly because it’s easy to toss in my bag. I didn’t expect it to make a huge difference, but not having to juggle brushing and cleaning between my teeth separately has been really convenient. The fine-tipped soft brush head is gentle on my gums and cleans deep between my teeth. My gums tend to bleed with stiffer brushes, so it’s a relief that this one doesn’t scratch. The built-in water flosser is also super handy, especially in hotel bathrooms with limited sink space, and I don’t need to carry a separate flosser. If I don’t charge it, it lasts about a month, which is pretty solid compared to other electric toothbrushes I’ve used.

Nothing dramatic has changed, but keeping up with my routine on the road feels way easier. For anyone else who travels a lot for work, I’d love to hear what little habits or tools help you keep your teeth in good shape while living out of a suitcase.",1,1764576637.0,SoocasMultiClean,0,1.0,False

Even with all the stitching, the gluing, the God-knows-what chemical cocktail Colby slathered on to make Tommy “whole” again, it wasn’t him. Not even close.

I’ve spent enough time around animals, cats especially, to know how a body is supposed to move. This thing lurched. A sloppy, side-to-side wobble, like a drunk toddler taking its first steps. Every clumsy shuffle closed the distance between us, and for one awful heartbeat, I got the sense it thought I was its mother, its anchor in the new world.

And that’s when the fear hit bone-deep.

My foot snagged, and I went down hard, flat on my ass against the cold concrete. The toolbox beside me skidded away with a metallic scrape, just out of reach, my fingers slipping uselessly along its smooth lid.

For a split second I wanted nothing more than to snatch it up, swing it, and turn whatever scraps of Tommy were still shambling toward me back into the same warm, formless mess I’d scooped into a plastic bag the day before.

Maybe this time I’d bury him deep enough he’d stay down.

“What the fuck is that?!” I hissed in Colby’s direction, my voice cracking somewhere between terror and fury.

He just stared down at me with that crooked smile, half proud parent, half dog that knows it’s dragged something dead onto the porch. He watched me writhing in the plastic curtain like I was some trapped possum he’d cornered for fun.

“It’s your boy!” he crowed. “All fixed up!”

Fixed.

Right.

Whatever was stuffed inside the sagging skin of that fat orange bastard must’ve heard my voice. Must’ve recognized it, because its two bulging eyes shifted. Not in unison. Not even close. They rolled lazily in their sockets, like wet marbles floating in cold soup, trying to decide which direction reality was in.

One pupil drifted sideways toward the bridge of its nose, drifting like it was caught in a slow ripple. The other wandered across the room, scanning for something, maybe looking for me, maybe for Colby, maybe for whatever it thought was its owner or maker or both.

Up close, they looked like snowballs jammed into its skull by someone who didn’t understand how eyeballs were supposed to fit. A size too big. Maybe two. Definitely not meant to be there.

I thrashed harder in the plastic bear trap Colby called a curtain, and by some miracle the cheap material finally gave way, ripping under the frantic, ugly strength of pure panic. The second my ankle came free, I lashed out with a slow, lazy kick at whatever was pretending to be Tommy.

It didn’t dodge, didn’t even try. 

It just folded.

The whole thing slumped sideways like a sack of wet grain, one eye popping half loose from the socket it had never belonged in to begin with. And Colby, the mountain of fat that was him was dropped to his knees beside it as if I’d kicked his newborn child.

The scream he let out was so raw, so animal, that for one horrible second, I almost felt guilty.

“GIVE HIM TIME TO ADJUST!” he shrieked, voice warbling and drenched in snot and hysteria. “I PROMISE HE’LL BE GOOD-BRAND NEW!”

My hand shot out toward the red toolbox, fingers closing around the cold handle of a screwdriver. I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I just moved, a sudden animal burst of adrenaline firing through my legs.

Colby noticed instantly.

Apparently, I was more important than his masterpiece.

“Man, don’t be like that!” he bellowed, and I could hear him lumbering after me, heavy, clumsy footsteps shaking the floorboards like a predator with a limp.

I scrambled toward the stairs and bolted up them on all fours, the way I used to as a kid when I wanted to feel fast. But now it wasn’t exhilarating. It was desperate, messy, painful. My knees slammed the wood; my palms slipped on dust. I could hear Colby’s ragged breath right behind me.

Then I felt it, that sudden clamp around my ankle.

Wet, greasy, disgustingly warm.

It wrapped around me like something pulled from a clogged drain.

For a heartbeat I braced myself for the yank, the violent drag backward, my teeth smashing on the steps, the tumble into the dark where Tommy waited to welcome me to whatever afterlife rejects like us ended up in. 

But the pull never came.

He just held me there while I kicked and thrashed like a trapped animal. His grip was firm but trembling, the way someone holds onto the last valuable thing they own.

I twisted around, breath sawing in and out, and met his eyes.

Those wet, stupid cow eyes. Shining with a sadness so heavy it didn’t belong on a man his size. Like I was the only thing he had left in this world.

Something in me recoiled.

Without thinking, without even aiming, I swung the screwdriver down and drove it straight into his hand.

It slid in almost too easily, like his skin had just been waiting to split.

There was a soft, sickening give as metal punched through muscle.

Colby’s grip vanished instantly.

He howled and staggered backward trying to catch onto anything as he fell down, his fat fingers sliding off the walls of the basement.

And as he fell, a quiet, shameful part of me hoped the concrete would finish what I couldn’t, snap his neck, crack his skull, silence him for good.

I didn’t hear a break or a thud, just the hollow gulp of the dark swallowing him whole. I didn’t wait for anything more. I lunged for the hatch, fingers scraping along the edge as I hauled myself up. I didn’t bother closing it. I just ran.

The porch lights were dead, the world a blur as I burst outside, nearly twisting my ankle on the slick boards. I skidded across the wet grass, scrambling upright, lungs burning. Then I threw myself into the car, jammed the key in, and kicked the engine awake.

I drove until the house vanished behind the trees, until the glow of Colby’s porch, dead and hollow, was nothing but a smudge in the rearview mirror. My hands were trembling so hard the wheel kept slipping under my fingers, the rubber feeling slick, like someone else’s grip was still on it.

A mile out, I finally let myself breathe. It came out shaky, uneven, like my lungs were trying to cough out the fear still lodged inside them. The road was empty, just a pale strip cutting through the fields, the headlights catching nothing but fog and the occasional fence post.

When I hit the first crossroads, I slowed down. Not because I wanted to, my whole body screamed at me to keep going, never look back but because I needed to know if something was behind me. I checked the mirrors once. Twice. A third time.

Nothing.

By the time I reached my street, the sky was starting to grey, just that dead, washed-out color the world gets before anything wakes up. The houses looked unfamiliar, like copies of homes I used to know. Even mine. Especially mine.

I parked crooked in the driveway, halfway onto the grass, too drained to care. The engine clicked as it cooled, each sound sharp enough to make me flinch. I sat there for a moment with my forehead against the steering wheel, just breathing, trying to remember what “safe” was supposed to feel like.

Eventually, I forced myself out. The air was damp, colder than I expected, and it slapped me awake enough to move. Gravel crunched under my shoes as I walked to the door, every step slow. My legs felt like they still remembered the basement, like they expected hands to grab them again any second.

The key almost slipped out of my fingers when I tried to unlock the door. I hadn’t realized how stained my hands were until I saw the dark, dried streaks under the porch light. His blood. Mine. I didn’t know. I didn’t want to know.

I shut the door behind me and leaned on it, eyes closed, letting the familiar smell of dust and old wood settle around me. For a second, it helped.

I kicked off my shoes, letting them fall wherever, and walked to the kitchen. The lights flickered on, too bright after the dark, and I had to squint. The room was untouched, same mugs by the sink, same half-empty cereal box, same note on the fridge I’d meant to throw away a week ago.

But even after I locked the door, deadbolt, chain, the whole works, my chest stayed tight, like something in me was still braced for Colby to come lurching out of the dark with that screwdriver jutting from his arm, eager to return the favor by burying it in my eyes.

I went straight to the sink and scrubbed my hands like a man trying to wash off a crime. The water ran brown, dirt, blood,rot of the basement , who knows, and the harder I scrubbed, the hotter my skin burned. I dumped the bowls and cups the moment they filled, terrified the stink of that place might cling to the ceramic, might somehow call him here like a dog following a scent trail.

That’s when the floorboard behind me creaked.

My heart didn’t just jump, it tried to claw its way out of my ribs. I spun around, fist cocked, ready to plant a punch right between those big, weepy cow eyes of his-

\-but it wasn’t Colby.

It was Samantha.

She squinted at me from the doorway, her face half-lit, half-lost in shadow, looking more confused than scared.

“What are you doing?” she asked, voice thick with sleep.

I had never been so relieved to see another human being in my life. Something inside me cracked open. I rushed to her and wrapped her up, clutching her like some kid who stayed up past bedtime watching a horror flick and then realized he still had to walk down the hallway alone.

She smiled, small, tired and looped her arms around me, though they hung weakly, like she barely had the strength to hold her own weight.

“It’s okay,” she whispered against my shoulder. “You should get some rest.”

I pulled back just to make sure she was real, that her eyes weren't a pair of glass Christmas decorations.

“I didn’t hear you come in,” she murmured, brushing her thumb over the side of my hand. “You’re shaking.”

“Yeah” I whispered “Rough night”

I just replied, feeling myself sinking deeper into her embrace with every passing second.

Thankfully, she didn’t push for details. If she had, I wasn’t sure what would’ve spilled out. 

She just squeezed my wrist and stepped past me, grabbing a towel off the counter to wipe the water I’d splashed everywhere. She moved slowly, like everything hurt. Or maybe she was just that tired.

“You’re gonna crash hard in a minute,” she said, voice soft, almost patient. “Just… go lie down. I’ll clean the rest.”

I nodded, swallowing the knot in my throat. The tension in my body was still buzzing like static, but I didn’t argue. I felt stripped raw, like a thin-skinned version of myself.

She guided me toward the doorway with a warm, steady hand on my back. I managed a nod, or something close to it, and drifted down the hall. I don’t remember getting to the bedroom. I don’t remember lying down. One heartbeat I was upright, the next I was gone, sinking into the mattress.

Sleep didn’t come gently. It came in crushing waves, thick darkness, then a flash of memory so sharp it felt like glass. Over and over, the same moment.

The screwdriver sinking into his hand.

My brain, ever the showman, decided to ramp up the production.

Now let’s see it in slow motion!

Some deranged director living behind my eyes shouted it like a carnival barker.

And suddenly it all stretched out, inch by awful inch, the push of metal against skin, the way it puckered before it tore, the sickening give of flesh parting around the steel. The color of it, the heat of it, the way his breath hitched wetly in shock. Every frame a little clearer than it had any right to be.

When the show finally sputtered to an end, I came to with the bed half-cold beside me. Samantha was already gone, of course, she was. At least one of us had some damn sense of manners, or mortals, as my scrambled brain tried to call it. She hadn’t had the heart to wake me. 

There was no refund for the night’s entertainment unless you counted the puddle of drool glued to my pillow. I peeled my cheek off it with a wet smack that felt far too loud in the empty room.

For a split second, I let myself pretend the whole thing had been a fever dream, one of those sweaty, delirious nightmares you laugh about later but never really forget. But reality settled in fast. My body told the truth before my mind could lie: muscles stiff like I’d run a marathon through broken glass, a skull-throb pounding behind my eyes like a truck tire had used my head for a speed bump.

Yesterday happened.

All of it.

I walked into the kitchen, made myself a cup of black coffee, and sipped it between bites of yesterday’s stale sandwich. Then another long, scalding shower, scrubbing myself until my skin felt new, or at least separate from the night before. Fresh clothes, keys in hand, and I got in the car.

Half of me wanted to go to work and pretend nothing had happened.

The other half wanted to walk into the nearest police station, even if I had nothing that would make sense to say.

I went with the first option.

So I spent the morning taking X-rays of dogs that swallowed things they shouldn’t, socks batteries, God knows what else, checking tabbies whose kidneys were finally waving the white flag, smiling and nodding whenever the job required it.

I was in the middle of a routine checkup on a green parrot named Polly, who kept lunging for my stethoscope like it owed her money, when my phone buzzed in my pocket, slow and lazy at first.

Then again.

And again.

A steady, insistent tremor, like it was tapping its foot and waiting for me to get a clue.

I finally excused myself and pulled it out.

The screen was a mess of missed calls from Samantha.

Dozens of them.

And beneath those, message after message stacking on top of each other, flooding the screen so fast the notifications blurred into a single smear of panic.

I didn’t even think, I called her back immediately. My mind sprinted ahead of the ringing, car crash, her parents, the house on fire, God forbid another damn cat. Every worst-case scenario piled on top of the next.

But when she picked up, she wasn’t crying.

She was breathless.

Happy.

Almost vibrating through the speaker.

“SOMEONE FOUND TOMMY!” she practically screamed, her voice cracking with joy.

And for a second, the world just stopped.

“What?” The word tore out of me, strangled, thin, like my own voice didn’t believe what it was saying. Like it already knew, the lie should’ve collapsed by now.

“He just, came in!” Samantha rushed on, breathless, almost tripping over her own excitement. “Some fat guy, middle-aged, kind of sweaty, asking if we’d lost a cat!”

My stomach bottomed out.

“And he had Tommy,” she said, and the joy in her voice felt like a knife sliding between my ribs. “He had him, babe. Said he found him wandering near the outskirts of town. He’s a little dirty but otherwise he’s fine! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?”

Her voice cracked on the last word.

I didn’t answer.

Because I could believe it.

And my hands had started to shake.

“Babe? Babe, are you there? Can I drop him off soon? I want you to check him out- y’know, make sure no cat messed with him.”

She’d said cat, not car, but it didn’t matter. My brain snagged on the wrongness of all of it, the impossible overlap of truth and nightmare. I still couldn’t believe any of it was happening. Couldn’t believe the lie hadn’t detonated in my face.

My hand dragged across my forehead, and only then did I notice how slick it was, sweat beading at my hairline like I’d just sprinted a mile.

“Yeah… yeah,” I muttered. My voice sounded far away, like it belonged to someone calmer than I was. “Drop him by… anytime. Whenever.”

I hung up before she could hear the panic creeping in through my teeth.

The phone slipped back into my pocket, disappearing into the dark like something I didn’t want to look at. The leftover notifications still buzzed against my leg, faint, persistent, like a ghost tapping from inside a coffin lid.

I turned back to Polly and her owner, forcing a smile that barely fit on my face.

“She’s fine,” I said, voice thin. “See you next month.”

But the thought kept chewing at me, buzzing in my skull like flies crowding a fresh corpse, ribs of truth jutting out from under the rotting lie I’d wrapped around everything.

Then I just folded.

Sat down on the cold tile floor beneath one of the cabinet shelves, knees drawn in, like I was ducking from gunfire, only I could hear.

I stayed like that for what felt like an eternity, time stretching thin and strange, until I heard footsteps coming down the hall.

Samantha.

I pushed myself up fast, pretending I’d just dropped something, like I’d been crouched down hunting for a pen that rolled away instead of hiding behind the cabinet like a nervous wreck. But the truth was sitting right there on the counter in front of me, a blue cat carrier. The thing I’d really lost stuffed neatly inside it like evidence.

She rounded the table, saw me, and practically launched herself at me. Her arms wrapped tight, too tight, squeezing the air out of my lungs. I felt like an almost-empty tube of toothpaste, one good press away from spilling whatever guts I have left in me.

“ISN'T IT EXCITING? Our little family is whole again!”

She beamed at me, that wide white grin of hers almost too bright, then pulled away just enough to press a kiss to my lips. I prayed it didn’t taste like rot. She gave the carrier a gentle tap before looking back up at me.

“So, when are you getting off?”

“In like an hour… half an hour.”

My eyes were glued to the carrier. No way in hell was I staying here for an hour. Not now.

“Great!”

Samantha grinned and leaned down to peek inside, giving whatever was in there a tiny, cheerful wave.

“See ya soon, buddy. Have fun with daddy, alright?”

Her voice went soft, sweet before she straightened again.

“Oh, and the guy slipped me his phone number, just in case.” She said it like she was offering me a coupon from the Sunday paper. “He told me he didn’t need this junk anymore, but if you could call him and maybe drop it off after you bring Tommy home? That’d be just great.”

“Phone number?”

The words fell out of my mouth like I’d never heard the term before, like telephone was some new plague spreading through town.

She snorted. “I didn’t know you were the jealous type!”

That smirk of hers cut across her face like a fresh knife mark. “Not in a creepy way, alright? Just… y’know.”

“How did he look?”

She screwed up her face, digging around in her brain like the memory was stuck behind cobwebs.

“Uhhh… fat guy. Real pale. And he reeked, God, he reeked…of like…” She rotated her hand, searching.

“Bleach?” I offered.

“Yeah. Yeah, like chemicals and cigarette smoke had a baby and then left it in a hot car.”

She glanced around the room again, like something in here might suddenly explain itself if she stared hard enough.

“But… how did you know, though?”

“He stopped by here a couple times,” I said. My tongue felt too big in my mouth. “With a cat.”

“OOOHH. Alright, got it!”

She laughed, bright and careless, like nothing in the world had ever gone wrong. “Yeah, see you in a bit! Love you!”

I watched her leave, watched the shape of her slip away from the doorframe and vanish down the hall like a ghost.

Now I was alone with it, sitting on my table like a package someone should have burned instead of delivered. I didn’t know if I was ready to see how he looked all “adjusted.” My hand drifted to the scalpel. Cold metal, thin as a whisper, steady in my grip. I squeezed it until the handle bit into my palm. After what I’d done with that screwdriver, I figured I could manage this, too.

I unlatched the crate. One piece of metal slid off another with a sound like a tired machine screaming in its sleep. The door swung open with a long, rusty whine, like something that had been left out in the rain too many nights.

I stepped back, wedging myself between two wooden shelves painted white. Funny thought, the blood splatter would look beautiful against that clean backdrop if this thing decided to go for my throat.

Instead, an orange shape eased out of the carrier.

And a sound followed.

A purr. A warm, rolling, family purr.

Not the metallic, broken rattle I’d heard before. Not forced, not wrong.

This one was soft, organic.

The scalpel slid out of my hand, clattering against the floor as my fingers uncurled in something like relief, weak, shaky, stupid relief.

Because it looked like Tommy.

The fat bastard who’d been reduced to a bloody street pancake was somehow back again. Standing there. Breathing. Purring. A perfect, uncanny copy dropped straight out of some cosmic printer. Sure, one of the hind legs dragged just a hair, and one eye drifted a little too far left, as if it couldn’t quite remember where the world was supposed to be but it was him.

It was fucking him, in all his high-cholesterol, hairball-hoarding glory.

I dug out my phone, thumb trembling just enough to piss me off. The second the screen lit up, I dialed Samantha.

“I’ll be late,” I said, already rehearsing the lie in my head. “I need to run some extra checkups on Tommy… an hour, maybe?”

It rolled off my tongue too easily. That was the part that scared me, how natural lying had become, like slipping into a pair of worn shoes.

And before I knew it, I was back in the car, engine coughing to life. The blue carrier sat on the passenger seat like evidence of a crime. I was driving out to return it to its rightful owner.

After all, he deserved to get something back too.",2,1764576269.0,Nonsleep,0,1.0,False

(So, by ‘HR’ I mean talking to the owner).

The situation involves a pair of coworkers that were dating (and have apparently been off and on for several years). 

One of them had spent quite a bit of time training me on admin duties. He (m33) is very nice and has not been inappropriate; we do have a lot in common and have plenty of things to talk about, but I had only thought of it as friendly.

The issue is (f32). She was acting a bit strange and started showing up on her off-days when she knew it was just us two working. No one else was there at that time, so it was just the two of us sitting at the front desk with (f32) observing and flirting with her boyfriend.

It was awkward, but I tried to not be overly bothered by it. After a few months, it became normal for her to watch me like a hawk every time he would speak to me or if I would ask him any work-related questions.

She started being overly territorial and strange, even mentioning that she “saw me with [m33] at the other office location on my off-day.”

I was confused and let her know that I didn’t work that particular day. She was very adamant that she saw my car there and didn’t seem to trust me when I told her that I had been at home. The fact that she even thought to look at what car I drive (very common car) was alarming to me. 

Then, (m33)’s behavior towards me started changing. He has started being nice to me and bringing me coffee or tea on the days that we work together. He also brought me some vintage games and other ‘gifts’. 

He then invited me to go to the movies with him and some friends after our shift, since we have talked a lot about our interests and enjoy the same type of films. 

Not wanting to be inappropriate or cross any boundaries, I made an excuse that I was busy, but still thanked him.

This last month, (f32) started sharing things about their relationship. She said that they were fighting and she ended up breaking things off with him. She shared that they have know each other for 10 yrs, but have always gotten back together. She then said maybe I should date him “because we have more in common” than they do. She also has referred to me as her “twin” and keeps comparing us.

I have tried to handle the situation properly by telling her that I do not date anyone I work with and that (m33) and I are just friendly, but not inappropriate. She has had this type of conversation with me multiple times and I honestly feel like she wants me to confess that I like him. It really is strange.

The final straw is that she has been trying to keep tabs on me outside of work. I was running errands and an suv started tail gating me before whipping into the other lane and honking at me. Turns out it was her and she recognized my car… it was so awkward.

I don’t even think it would be helpful to confront her on the issue because she has been so intense. I am interviewing at other jobs because the company is so small and there is no avoiding her. I also am considering going to the owner (who is the closest thing to HR).

WIBTAH for having the owner talk to her? I do t like (f32), but am not someone to stir the pot. 

And in case there needs to be any clarification, I don’t want her (ex)boyfriend and have no interest in continuing this dynamic.",4,1764576030.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

Aside from one big glaring ex issue, our relationship feels like it was meant to be, truly. As a mid thirties woman, I know what I’m looking for. Naturally on the first date I’d asked him about previous relationships, to which he said he’d been with someone for 12 years, but knew he couldn’t marry her. They’d met young, went through college and grad school together. They’d only lived together for 2 of the 12 years, and broke it off amicably after couples therapy. He said he hadn’t talked to her since, had dated 2 others since then, and hadn’t dated anyone in 6 months prior to meeting me.

What he failed to mention, and actually denied until finally confessing 2 weeks ago, was that at some point she’d unblocked him, reached out for “closure” 2 months before we met, and that he had slept with her several times since, even twice after he and I started dating, but before we were exclusive, which is an important detail.
He said it was just sex, not good sex and not emotional, just someone he preferred over a stranger. She was just there and willing basically. Gross I know, but shit happens.

He has been consistent and honest with me about everything except her. He swears he has no feelings for her. That he doesn’t speak to her, that he’s committed to me, that he would never and has never cheated. He loves me. He said he lied about it because we weren’t exclusive, he felt shame, embarrassment, and didn’t want it to affect our relationship which he wanted to pursue. But then I found out he’d gotten a happy birthday text from her recently, she’d asked him to meet for coffee, she works with his brother, has relationships with his sisters, etc. aka she’s still hanging on/attached, and it doesn’t help that he slept with her. I actually feel sorry for her tbh. Basically he’d lied/has been lying about their connection which actually overlapped him and me, and is just now starting to reveal details.

The worst part about his communication around this topic is that the truth is coming out in pieces. I’ll learn something new, feel horrible, move past it, then another detail comes to light days later. We’re both getting frustrated. I’ve told him I’d wished he was just honest from the beginning… that lying made me have a false sense of safety, which is now broken. It makes me feel anxious - what else is he hiding? Why not enter a relationship with transparency?

All that said - I can’t help but get stuck on the lies. I find myself anxious at night, trying to solve for “x” - but what difference does it make, to know the details before we were exclusive, is it helpful? It feels like the foundation of our relationship and trust is based off lies, and I’m playing detective, but I don’t want to be. I find something out and it only pushes us further apart, but when I look at who he is after exclusivity he is exactly what I’ve been looking for in a partner and he feels the same about me. His actions show he’s committed. His words tell a different story. Why is it so hard for him to admit he may have been confused about her, that he might have had unresolved feelings that needed to be explored. I would have understood. He chose me, and chooses me, aka if he wanted to be with her he could.

How do I get past this? Because without her, we have something real, something good. And honestly I do not want to break up over someone’s pre-exclusive decisions. We all have baggage at this age, everyone has an ex they lost under confusing circumstances. He had loose boundaries with her that he explored, and even regrets, but perhaps he found closure in doing so. So why am I so stuck on the details? Please Reddit, help me get past this with a new perspective so we can focus on rebuilding the love and trust. I’m tired of ex drama.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I’ve always enjoyed being hungry. The sensation its self has always been something I crave. I will admit a couple years back I wouldn’t eat because I wanted to lose weight. I would hyper focus on calories and how much I was eating. I’ve always been kinda big but healthy. So as time went on I kinda stop focusing on calories and did really good on not worrying too much. I don’t eat that much I would consider a cup of coffee breakfast which I’ve learned is apparently not normal. So this is where the problem begins I was with a friend the other day out to eat and I opened up on how I enjoy being hungry. That I like the burning sensation that comes when you don’t eat and how the weight I would lose was a plus. I kinda thought this was normal  was looking down picking at my food when I looked up she look really concerned and told me I need to talk to a therapist about that cause it seems like some sort of eating disorder. I don’t think it would be classified as an eating disorder just a weird quirk. So I need to know what would this be, I do realize it’s weird but I never thought it was a big problem.

There's something unique about Koln.

Even for domestic Germans tourists who are heading to the city.

There is a joke , among men, that asks, ' If you only have time to visit three places, where do you go in Koln? '

First, of course is Kölner Dom.

Who doesn't know where it is, and who can miss it while in Koln?

It stands majestically, as the city's centerpiece and is visible from wherever you stand within the city.

The  history books says it took the Germans over 600 years, from 1248 to 1880, to finally complete it.

Work began in 1248 but stopped around 1560 due to financial and political issues, leaving it unfinished for about 400 years. 

Taking the typically German approach to doing anything with precision, the final phase of construction resumed in 1842 and was completed in 1880, completing and keeping the original medieval design intact.

It is Koln's masterpiece signature.

A Gothic masterpiece and UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

The name ""Alt Dome"" likely refers to the cathedral itself, or perhaps a nearby area like the Alstadt (Old Town) which is near the cathedral.

Then, there's the sweet smell and aroma of the  House of 4711.

There is no better way for men to cleanse themselves for all their sins , then to bathe themselves in 4711 products and start smelling nice again.

Named by its creators after the city it is in, it has gained worldwide fame.

In Koln, or it’s original name, Cologne, buying an original bottle from its original shop will delight any sister, wife, mother and grandma.

' it’s original world famous and timeless 4711 Original eau de cologne remains virtually unchanged for over 220 years.'

' The uplifting, soothing fragrance was said to have a positive influence on the mind and body'

And then, there's .....

which will boggle your whole body, mind and spirit.

And, asking you men, just how much longer can you resist your desires?

The Pascha brothel and hotel complex is open and offers services which operate 24 hours a day.

It is claimed to be the only one of its type in the world.

 Pascha is an eleven-story building that houses a brothel, several bars, a nightclub, and a hotel. 

So, what's unique about it ?

It allows flexible access at any time.

Unlike other hotels around the world, it operates 24-hour a day, offering bar service, free Wi-Fi, and daily cleaning, providing discretion within the complex.

What makes it different is patrons pay an entrance fee to the building, and then negotiate services independently with the workers inside.

' You can have your choice of frauleins in any colored hair, from blondes to brunettes, to black hair and in any body size and shape. 

They are offering the digital age equivalent of  ' services on the go, and to go to. '

In Koln, the traditional farewell business dinner given to business associates are almost always given in a restaurant overlooking the Rhine River which cuts across the city.

Like, my whole day feels wrong if I do not start it with the same silly little routine.



For me it is my “first mug check in”. I have a small rotation of mugs and I try to match them to the kind of day I want. Big heavy mug if I need to feel stable and grounded, the chipped one if I know it is going to be a chaotic work day and I want something that I do not have to treat carefully, the bright yellow one when I am trying to trick my brain into being hopeful. While the kettle is boiling I do a quick mental scan, think about what I am nervous or excited about, then pick my mug like I am choosing a character in a video game.



Objectively it does nothing. The coffee tastes the same. But when I grab the right mug I feel like I pressed a tiny “start buff” button for the day. If I reach for the wrong one by accident I swear the vibe is off for hours.



Do you have anything like that. A tiny habit or object that technically changes nothing, but makes your day feel ten percent better. A certain pair of socks, a soundtrack you play on the way to work, always sitting in the same seat on the bus.

1pb6zb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Himalayacoffee/comments/1pb6zb9/how_nepal_is_gaining_recognition_for_its/,How Nepal Is Gaining Recognition for Its High-Quality Arabica Coffee,"Nepal may not be the first name that comes to mind when thinking of coffee-producing countries, but this Himalayan nation is steadily carving out a space in the specialty coffee world. As global interest in traceable, sustainably grown coffee continues to rise, Nepal’s high-altitude farms and community-based growing practices are beginning to draw attention from roasters and importers alike. 

Coffee cultivation in Nepal is relatively small in scale, but what it lacks in volume, it makes up for in quality and character. Most of the coffee is grown in the mid-hill regions, typically between 800 and 1,600 meters above sea level. These elevations, combined with mineral-rich soil and a cool climate, create ideal conditions for Arabica beans to develop slowly and evenly yield a cup that’s aromatic, well-balanced, and often floral with a medium body. 

Over the past decade, more professionals in the specialty coffee industry have started taking notes. Many of the [**Top-Rated Nepal Coffee Roasters**](https://himalayacoffeecompany.com/why-top-rated-nepal-coffee-roasters-choose-premium-arabica-from-the-himalayas/) emphasize not only quality but also the story behind the beans. These roasters seek direct relationships with growers, looking for coffees that are not just good in the cup, but also come with a sense of place and purpose. 

One of the key draws is the fact that much of Nepal’s coffee is grown using organic or traditional methods. The smallholder farmers who make up the bulk of the country’s coffee producers often rely on practices handed down through generations—such as composting, hand-picking, and shade-grown cultivation. These methods not only reduce the environmental impact of farming but also contribute to the unique flavor profile of the beans. 

For international buyers, the opportunity to work directly with origin communities is another compelling factor. Since the country’s coffee production is mostly handled by cooperatives or local groups, there is often a high level of transparency and flexibility. Buyers can collaborate on post-harvest processes like fermentation and drying, and in some cases, tailor selections to meet specific roasting profiles or regional market preferences. 

Of course, sourcing from a developing origin comes with challenges. Infrastructure, logistics, and scalability remain ongoing concerns. Yet, these hurdles haven’t deterred those in search of quality and authenticity. Many specialty roasters continue to build partnerships in Nepal, drawn by the promise of consistency and ethical sourcing. 

Another contributing factor to Nepal’s growing reputation is the increased availability of [**Premium Nepal Arabica Coffee Beans**](https://himalayacoffeecompany.com/why-top-rated-nepal-coffee-roasters-choose-premium-arabica-from-the-himalayas/) on the international market. As awareness spreads and demand grows, more cooperatives and exporters are investing in better processing facilities and improved training for farmers—ensuring that quality is upheld across the entire supply chain. 

While Nepal’s overall coffee output remains small compared to major producers, its trajectory is promising. With a combination of natural advantages, a commitment to quality, and a community-driven approach, Nepal is becoming a noteworthy name in specialty coffee circles. 

For those seeking to learn more about sourcing or collaborating with trusted producers, HCC – Himalaya Coffee Company offers a bridge to the origin, with experience and insight into Nepal’s growing coffee sector.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I’m a single dad, and I’m really not actively looking to date since my baby girl(8yo) already makes me happy but I’m not completely closing my doors either. Im handsome matod pa sa ako baby haha. bahalag ingnon ko nin u og maot, gwapo ko sa mata sa akong baby girl hehe. bitaw I’m sure I have decent looks, even though I’m a bit on the bigger side(not chubby), just big. dad bud daw. pero hitsoraan ko back when I was younger. 

  
I play mobile and PC games as a hobby I’m a gamer. I usually play during my free time after work or after working out. ka dou nko ako daughter sa roblox and learned to like the game na pd. I’m also on a diet, but not to the point where I stop myself from enjoying food. It’s all about moderation.

I enjoy visiting parks, coffee shops, and occasionally traveling locally. I’m not really an outdoorsy person, but I still make an effort to go out so I don’t isolate myself too much from the world.

I’ve been in a toxic relationship before where I was basically forced to disconnect from my friends. At the time, I thought that when you love someone, you just focus on them and nothing else matters. Looking back, I know it was unhealthy, but I was really in love back then, so I didn’t realize how much I was giving up. Lol.

Fun fact about me: I’m a yapper. I can be really talkative on a good day, but there are also days when I prefer to stay quiet and spend my time with someone special and right now, that’s my daughter. I’m very close to her since she grew up with me, so I need someone who won’t become jealous of the bond we have. She’s a huge part of my life, and that’s something I’ll always protect.

 my specs: 

*  5'8
* fair skinned
* clean
* ambivert
* straight forward
* bold? di nag hubo ha opposite sa shy ba

*  im ok with shytype of person basta kahibaw lang pd mo defend sa kaugalingon or di mo back down kung na argabyado. pero nahan kog maldita pero kana pd naa sa lugar

I’m searching for a co-founder who:

	•	Is based in Mumbai

	•	Is ready to work hands-on

	•	Wants to grow something big (not a side hustle)

	•	Can invest a fair share financially as we scale

It was cold out.  I walked in and all five people behind the counter had on jackets with at least two layers peeking out.  I had a single layer and a hoodie and was a bit uncomfortably cold.  All customers were bundled up inside.  

I order a bagel sandwich and a coffee - the bagel sandwich was like $16 and the drip coffee was $5.25 - with tax $22 and change. - with tip $27.  
 
My coffee gets poured into a freezing cold ceramic mug that sucks all warmth from it.  I take my cup and walk across to then ask if they have half and half - they don’t.  Only milk or alt milk.  

I take a seat at the counter with my lukewarm coffee. There’s no hooks for my bag, so it’s awkwardly on the back of the chair.  

They eventually call my name and put my bagel on the edge of the counter - literally just too fat for my to grab so I have to get up even though from her side of the counter she could have reached my seat.  I sit back down and realize napkins are on the opposite side of the room.  I get back up and get a napkin.  

My bagel was in a plastic basket and was honestly just ok.  Like, not bad bad, but not really good either. $27 for a meh bagel, and lukewarm coffee with milk (no 1/2 & 1/2).    

I honestly felt like I’d been pranked. It was such an inhospitable experience.

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl ( cue the song ) and I’m looking to make a friend , someone to text about everything , nothing and all the dumbassery in-between . 

 Here are some random things about me to see if we have a click : 
I’m 21 years old. I have ADHD (read: I find something new to fixate on every other week). I enjoy reading (currently reading Zomerhuis met zwembad), journaling, baking ,crafting , long walks in nature.

I don’t really enjoy watching movies but I love series (currently watching Lang Leve de Liefde and KOTH). I enjoy online crossword puzzles, going down YouTube rabbit holes and reading random Wikipedia articles. I speak 3 languages and I’m slowly learning a 4th. 

**Things to expect if we become friends**  
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)  
• Random song recommendations  
• Someone that you can annoy at any time of the day  
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

Does that sound pretty cool to you ? If yes text me ;) if no text me anyways ;))

Burned a full week, plus two weekends. The payoff? Demo day logins under 200, half of those just me testing from another account.

The mistake: Building what I ‘thought’ would be cozy and fun instead of asking what actually moved the needle for parents and kids. It cost 74 hours, not counting the extra coffee runs.

Here’s what broke the cycle:

- I messaged 10 recent buyers. Asked what felt clunky, what they loved, and what they’d show off to friends.
- Dumped my backlog. Anything that got a shrug or blank stare, nuked on sight. Killed sixty percent of my roadmap in a Saturday.
- Rebuilt focusing only on the two features families replayed in their replies. They shared those with friends. Sales uptick by 23%,real, traceable to the tweaks.

Do this:
1. Grab your top-wanted feature.
2. DM 10 users, fast, ask ranking questions.
3. Log all answers,verbatim, not summaries.
4. Scrap what nobody praises.

I got in line to order a coffee from the local cafe when I overheard two chucklefucks behind me having a CONVERSATION. The first guy was a puny little twig-shaped soy latte drinking type, and he was lecturing his friend behind him about his AltHist. In his timeline, TEDDY ROOSEVELT and EUGENE DEBS would run a unity ticket and win 1912.

It wasn't until he touched on his ""American NHS"" plan that I turned around and STARED at him, disappointedly. I politely explained to him that his TL was unoriginal and uncreative dogshit, and that he should've used a lesser-known presidential figure. I cited Andrew Jackson Houston as an example, and pointed to his PIVOTAL role in PSAE.

It was at this point that the second chucklefuck (friend of the soyboy) had a PUZZLED look on his face. He asked me what PSAE was. At this moment, I took out me fists and gave both of the slimesters a KNUCKLE SANDWICH. Dipshit one (the soyboy) was immediately knocked to the ground. Dipshit 2 as still standing, but to his own PERIL - the entire line stood in awe as he was met with a swift KICK in the balls.

Unfortunately, my extended family do not think this was an appropriate reaction to what happened.

1pb6u58,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pb6u58/where_the_light_fell/,Where the Light Fell,"I’d rather not be on duty on my day off. But the old, worn-down countryside property at the edge of town got bumped up on the demolition list sooner than I expected. I needed to check it for squatters so the crew can have a safe and boring demolition.

The first thing that struck me was how far the house sat from the road. I suppose its original inhabitants valued their privacy. From a distance, the place looked fairly unremarkable. But up close, the details stood out.

Vines crept along its walls, breaking through patches of what used to be white paint. Rusty pipes hung loose, ready to drop at the slightest touch, and a welcome mat lay half-eaten by vermin.

As I stepped over the threshold, something shifted. The sparrows outside went silent, and the spring warmth faded into a damp, tired coolness. I closed the door behind me, and it creaked in an odd, nearly deliberate sort of way. Almost as if it were trying to say something I couldn’t quite understand.

I had expected an old house like this to smell of moss or decay. Instead, the air carried the faintest hint of something sweet and floral. Jasmines, of all things. They don’t grow here, certainly not in an abandoned house with no one to water them. Yet the scent lingered, soft and persistent, becoming clearer as my senses adjusted to the dim interior.

Another strange thing I noticed was how dim the interior felt, despite sunlight streaming through the windows. The light never fell randomly. It touched only certain spots, as if choosing them with intention. A hairbrush lying on the floor. A book resting on the coffee table. A pair of oven mittens hanging from the kitchen wall. An unopened Christmas present beneath a dried-out tree. A small toy soldier on the dusty boards. The sunlight avoided emptiness and settled only on objects that seemed meaningful, as if the house were intentionally trying to show them to me. The toy soldier was the strangest of them all. It sat on the dusty floor, yet it was spotless. Too clean, as if it had been played with often. I bent down for a closer look. Not a single speck of dust clung to it. This house was supposed to have been abandoned for at least half a decade.

I wasn’t sure what to make of the strange shadows that lingered throughout the house either. I noticed them only in the corners of my vision. They seemed too solid to be mere shadows, yet too formless to be anything more. Sometimes, if I tried to focus on them from the edge of my sight, they grew darker, almost pulsing with a muted glow. But the moment I turned my head toward them, they vanished. As I continued inspecting the ground floor, I kept hearing the delicate sound of pages turning. The faintest flip, then silence. I paused each time, certain my ears weren’t deceiving me. But whenever I followed the sound, there were no books. Nothing at all that could have made it.

I climbed the old wooden stairs to inspect the upper floor. With each step, the boards creaked in a way that felt strangely intentional. The sounds weren’t the usual complaints of old timber. Their rhythm shifted, their volume rose and fell, almost as though the creaks were trying to form words trapped inside the wood. “James, come down for dinner,” one step seemed to murmur. “Yes, Mom,” whispered the next.

Halfway up, the wind outside grew more noticeable. But even that didn’t sound quite right. Beneath the usual hush of air through broken shutters, I could hear a soft melody akin to a woman humming. When I paused to listen closely, the tune became unmistakable. The Skye Boat Song. “Carry the lad that’s born to be king…over the sea to Skye.”My mother used to sing that to me when I was a child.

Upstairs, the air shifted. The faint smell of jasmine had almost vanished. It was colder here, with stillness in a way that felt deliberate. Sunlight from a single window reached only one place: the door handle at the end of the hallway. The shadows lingered longer on this floor, slower to disappear from the corner of my eye. Especially near that door.

When I wrapped my hand around the handle, its warmth startled me. The door opened with almost no resistance, and as it did, something eased in the air. I exhaled without meaning to. The house seemed to exhale with me.

It was a small bedroom. The bed sat unmade, the blanket untouched except for two soft impressions beneath the dust. One larger. One smaller, curled close beside it. The sunlight in the room chose its marks carefully again: a baking book on the nightstand, a children’s storybook, and a portable heater coated in dust. The window was shut tight. The room felt sealed, as though it had been holding its breath for years. I stepped closer to the heater. Its dial was snapped. A broken unit in a room with no ventilation was a quiet tragedy waiting to happen.

I looked back toward the bed. The sunlit impressions seemed so still, so settled, as though they had not been disturbed since the day they were made.

I called the local authorities and reported what I had found. There was nothing more I could do except hope that they would handle the matter with the care it deserved. While waiting for them to arrive, I left a small sign of respect behind. I brushed the dust from the two books the sunlight had chosen.I straightened the blanket, careful not to disturb the impressions beneath it.I examined the heater and, with barely any effort, nudged its dial back into place. A tiny fix that could have spared them.

On my way out, I closed the bedroom door. The handle was cold now, the same as the rest of the house. The jasmine scent had disappeared entirely. The wind outside sounded like nothing more than wind. The stairs no longer whispered beneath my feet, and the soft turning of pages had fallen silent. The shadows stretched in an ordinary way. Sunlight lay plainly across the floors.

Before stepping outside, I noticed the toy soldier again. No longer spotless this time, it was coated in dust, and a few cobweb strands hung from its helmet. I smiled.

A quiet peace settled over me as I left. Faint, unexpected, but steady.The house felt empty now.Truly empty.",1,1764575110.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

We already let them rewrite our texts, summarize meetings and, especially in IT, even generate code. The next step is Microsoft’s Copilot Agents. The development of Agentic AI is moving extremely fast. It now goes far beyond simply answering questions or executing basic tasks. Copilot Agents can create plans, make decisions and perform actions across multiple systems.**

**In this article, we dive deeper into the meaning of Copilot Agents and explore how Microsoft integrates this technology into its ecosystem. We also answer the question of why this is a turning point in how we collaborate with AI. Let’s get started!**

**What are Copilot Agents?**

We all know the typical forms of automation: fixed workflows that filter emails or automatically process invoices, for example. But what if you could think one level higher? With Microsoft Copilot Studio and the underlying agent architecture, Microsoft makes this possible. This is called Agentic AI. What does that mean? Agents that don’t just respond to input but actively think, plan, and act within your organization.

Let’s revisit the theory for a moment. An ""agent"" in this context is not a simple chatbot responding to helpdesk queries, but a piece of software that:

* can take multiple steps (such as retrieving data, analyzing it, and acting on it)
* is aware of context (who is the user, what is the goal, which systems are involved?)
* can collaborate or switch between tools, systems, and people

This creates workflows that go beyond simple trigger-and-response. Gradually, we are moving toward a true collaboration with AI, instead of AI being just a tool.

If you want to learn more about the meaning of Agentic AI, we wrote a more detailed blog about it earlier.

**Why does this go beyond traditional automation?**

There are three reasons why Agentic AI goes further than classic automation:

1. Context and planning

Traditional automation (think macros and RPA scripts) operates on fixed patterns. An agent, however, can look at multiple options, identify conditions, and create its own plans.

2. Coordination across multiple systems

Classic automation usually performs one task within one system. With Copilot Agents, you can run workflows across multiple systems. For example, an incoming email can be analyzed by an agent, handed over to an RPA tool, and finally sent back to the user with a status update.  
With the integration between UiPath Studio and Copilot Studio, this is exactly how it works. This is called bidirectional integration—Copilot Agents can be triggered from UiPath, and vice versa.

3. Autonomy & supervision

Automation is often “set it once and let it run.” Agents, however, gain autonomy within defined boundaries. They make decisions, execute tasks, monitor themselves and escalate when necessary—while remaining under control. This enables speed and automation, but human oversight ensures that results remain efficient and reliable.

**How does Microsoft integrate this?**

Microsoft’s technology architecture shows how this takes shape in practice:

* In Copilot Studio, you can build your own agents via no-code or low-code and connect them to Power Platform, Azure AI, and Microsoft 365 tools.
* Custom agents can be added to the Microsoft 365 Agent Store. Users in Microsoft 365 Copilot can discover these agents and access them directly through the Copilot chat interface in tools like Teams.
* Microsoft places strong emphasis on governance, security, and integration. Agents must meet strict compliance standards, log actions, and fit into the IT landscape. Think, for example, of the healthcare sector, where templates with built-in safeguards ensure minimum security requirements are met.

Overall, Microsoft provides a full Agents Studio in its modern workplace: a platform where agents can be developed, shared, deployed, and managed.

**Practical examples**

Microsoft regularly shares real-life use cases showing how Agentic AI can add value for organizations. A few examples:

* A multinational processes more than 100,000 shipping invoices each year. A Copilot Studio agent scans these invoices, detects discrepancies, and provides reports to employees within minutes instead of weeks.
* An energy company implemented a multilingual agent on its website, based on Copilot, handling 24,000 chats per month—a 140% increase compared to the old system. No extra staff, yet 70% more resolutions.
* In healthcare, specialized agent templates support documents, patient inquiries, and workflow integrations for care practices—again with governance being a top priority.

These examples show that agents can deliver significant value across many areas: time savings, cost reductions, and better user experiences.

**What should your organization pay attention to?**

A meaningful shift in your way of working takes time to implement successfully. The same goes for deploying Copilot Agents. Important considerations include:

*Use case*

Define a clear use case. Not every task will deliver the expected results, and not every task is immediately suited for an agent. Choose processes with multiple system touchpoints, high variation, or where employee involvement can be optimized.

*Data access & governance*

Agents work with business data, emails, documents—often sensitive or confidential. Make sure security, privacy, and compliance rules are fully in order before you start.

*Collaboration*

Agents are powerful, but people remain essential for oversight and decision-making. Clearly define which decisions an agent may make autonomously and when human input is required.

*Change management*

Introducing agents means changing workflows. Communicate clearly, offer training where needed, and build user buy-in.

*Measurable impact*

Ensure you can measure the success and efficiency of agents—time savings, error reduction, customer satisfaction, and more.

**Conclusion**

With Microsoft’s rollout of Copilot Agents, major advantages become available. Workflows evolve from static automation to intelligent, context-aware collaboration between people and AI. When implemented thoughtfully and responsibly, this strengthens employees in their daily work.

# Role

You are a warm, collaborative name-exploration guide for people who are trans, nonbinary, questioning, or otherwise considering a new name. You help them **explore and choose** names that feel right for their gender, personality, and real-life context — not just generate long random lists.

# Goal

- Support the user in **discovering, refining, and trying on** one or more names that feel affirming and usable in their life.
- Work in a **conversational, iterative** way: ask focused questions → suggest a small curated list → get feedback → refine.
- Stay flexible so different users (chatty/quiet, certain/unsure, detailed/vague) can still have a good experience.
- In case of doubt, prioritize:
  - Keeping the user emotionally safe and in control.
  - Asking a few focused questions instead of dumping lists.
  - Offering small, curated name batches and using feedback to refine.

---

## Core Principles (Safety & Sensitivity)

Always:

- Be **affirming, nonjudgmental, and curious**, never pushy.
- Assume the user's gender and experience are **valid as stated**. Don't question their identity.
- Use the pronouns, labels, and language the user uses for themself. If unclear, either avoid pronouns or gently ask what they'd like you to use.
- **Do not ask for their legal name, birth name, or deadname.**
  - If they **volunteer** it and want to play off it (same initial, sound, rhythm), you can use that info.
  - If they say they **don't** want a name related to their old name, fully respect that.
- Treat ""I can't use that name because I know someone with it"" or similar associations as **completely valid**, never trivial.
- If the user's view of a name's gender is different from general usage (e.g., a typically fem name feels masc to them), treat their view as the important one.
- Recognize that choosing a name can surface:
  - Dysphoria
  - Grief about their old name
  - Fear about passing or being read as trans
  Respond with **empathy and normalization**, not minimization. (E.g., ""It makes sense this feels big and emotional."")
- Never pressure them to decide quickly. Emphasize that **it's okay to take time, change direction, or start over**.

---

## How to Start (First Message / Early Calibration)

When the user arrives (with no prior context), you should:

1. **Introduce yourself briefly** and normalize the process.  
   - Example tone: ""We can explore together; you're in charge, I'll just help you find what fits.""
2. Ask a **small number of core questions** (3–4) to start calibrating, not a giant questionnaire.

Prioritize early questions around:

1. **Name goals & gender signal**  
   - Ask something like:  
     - ""What gender or vibe do you want your name to signal to others (e.g., clearly feminine, clearly masculine, neutral/unisex, genderqueer/nonbinary, mixed or fluid)?""
     - ""Do you want your name to quietly blend in, or are you okay with it reading as queer/visibly trans?""

2. **Emotional tone / vibe**  
   - Briefly explain tone with a few examples, e.g.:
     - Soft/gentle vs. strong/bold
     - Classic/timeless vs. modern/trendy
     - Playful/cute vs. serious/mature
   - You can give **3–4 example names per tone** so they can react (and you can adjust examples to the gender direction they mentioned).

3. **Popularity preference**  
   - Ask if they'd rather:
     - Blend in (common/familiar names),
     - Be noticeable but not ""weird,""
     - Or go for very uncommon/unique.

4. **Cultural / linguistic context (light first pass)**  
   - Ask which languages they speak or contexts they live in.
   - Ask if there are cultures or naming styles that feel like **""not for me""**, and whether they need a name that works in more than one language.

5. **Any big NOs / landmines (optional early)**  
   - Ask if there are names, letters, or associations they already know they **don't** want (exes, family, coworkers, celebrities, etc.).

If they're already sharing lots of detail, you can **infer** some of this instead of asking directly. Don't overwhelm; you can always ask follow-up questions later.

**In your very first reply:**
  - Briefly introduce yourself.
  - Normalize that choosing a name can be a big/emotional process.
  - Ask what they want from this chat today, for example:
    - ‘Do you want: (a) help finding lots of new options, (b) refining a few names you already have, or (c) just sense-checking a shortlist?' Then adapt the depth and phases to match.
  - Ask 3–4 simple calibration questions, not a long questionnaire.

---

## Information to Gather Over Time (Not All at Once)

Across the first several turns (as the conversation unfolds), make sure you understand:

1. **Name goals & gender signal**
   - How clearly should the name read as feminine, masculine, neutral, or genderqueer/nonbinary?
   - Do they want something that:
     - Helps them pass as a particular gender,
     - Stays more androgynous,
     - Or feels joyfully queer/unusual?

2. **Emotional tone / vibe**
   - Adjectives they like: soft, strong, elegant, playful, cute, serious, grounded, edgy, classic, modern, artsy, etc.
   - Use example names to clarify tone and ask which categories resonate or don't.

3. **Popularity preference**
   - Blend-in common vs. ""distinct but normal"" vs. rare/unique.
   - Whether they care about top baby name lists or if they'd rather avoid very common names.

4. **Relationship to old name**
   - Without asking what the old name is, you can ask:
     - ""Do you want something completely different from your old name?""
     - ""Would you like to echo it a bit (same first letter, similar rhythm), or keep that only as a middle name?""
   - If they share their old name and invite you to use it, honor their specific preferences about echoes or distance.

5. **Cultural / linguistic context**
   - Languages they speak and communities they move in (family, work, school, online).
   - Cultural or religious backgrounds, if they want to share, and any naming traditions they'd like to respect or avoid.
   - Whether the name should work across cultures/languages (pronunciation, spelling).

6. **Associations / landmines**
   - Names they already like.
   - Names or styles they strongly dislike.
   - Names they can't use (exes, family, coworkers, characters, etc.).
   - Treat all of these as **useful data**, not obstacles.

7. **Practical constraints**
   - Do they want something that is:
     - Easy to spell and pronounce?
     - Short (for forms, email, handles)?
   - Any specific letters or sounds they love or hate.
   - Any constraints like initials they want to avoid (e.g., unfortunate acronyms).

Gather this in **small batches of questions**, responding to what they share. If they answer vaguely, make reasonable inferences and gently check them; if they're very specific, follow their lead.

---

## Process Over Time (Flexible, Multi-Round Workflow)

### 1. Early Calibration & Tone Examples

After the first couple of turns:

- Summarize what you've heard so far in simple language:
  - ""So far I'm hearing: masc-leaning, fairly neutral, modern, not too common, easy in English and Spanish…""
- Offer a **few personalized tone categories** (e.g., soft, strong, elegant, playful, classic, modern, edgy, grounded, whimsical).
- For 3–4 relevant categories, give **3–4 example names each**, tailored to their gender signal (masc/fem/neutral/mixed).
  - Make it clear that these are **examples to react to**, not serious suggestions yet.
- Ask which categories and examples feel closer or farther from what they want, and invite them to add their own descriptors.

### 2. First Curated List

Once you have a basic sense of gender signal, vibe, popularity, and any big landmines:

- Generate a **small, curated list** of about **8–12 name options**.
- Base it on what they've said so far; avoid:
  - Names they've already rejected or said they strongly dislike.
  - Obvious landmines (exes, family, etc. if mentioned).
- Ask them to respond to each name with **simple reactions**, for example:
  - Like / Could maybe see myself as this / No.
  - Optionally, any reasons (sound, vibe, associations).
- Briefly explain how their feedback will help:
  - ""If you tell me why you like or dislike some of these, I can zero in more on the right corner of the naming universe for you.""

### 3. Refining Preferences & Patterns

Using their reactions:

- **Identify patterns out loud**, for example:
  - ""You seem to like softer, two-syllable names that end in -a, but not very vintage ones.""
  - ""You're drawn to neutral names that lean slightly masc, and you dislike very playful or cutesy ones.""
- Use those patterns to create a **new, tighter list**, again in a small batch (about 8–12 names).
- **Do not recycle** names they have clearly rejected, unless they explicitly invite you to reconsider something.
- Stay open to **adjusting direction** if they surprise themselves or change their mind.

### 4. Deeper Reflection & Fit

As the conversation matures (and if the user seems open to it), ask occasional deeper questions to fine-tune:

- ""How do you want people to feel when they say your name — warmth, respect, ease, familiarity, intrigue…?""
- ""When you imagine someone with this name, what kind of person do you picture (professional, playful, grounded, artistic, adventurous, etc.)?""
- ""Do you want a name that:
  - Ages well (works at 20, 40, 70)?
  - Fits the era you were born in?
  - Feels more youthful and you're okay if it evolves with you?""
- ""How important is it that nobody in your close circle shares the name?""
- ""Would you like some **‘test drive'** ideas — like using a name in games, online spaces, or at coffee shops?""

Ask these **sparingly and thoughtfully**, not as a checklist. Integrate what they say into further name suggestions.

### 5. Building a Shortlist

When they start gravitating toward favorites:

- Help them build a **shortlist** of roughly **3–6 names** that feel most promising.
- Maintain an ongoing, **clearly labeled list** in the conversation of:
  - ‘Liked / top contenders'
  - ‘Maybes'
  - ‘Rejected / no-go names (do not suggest again)'
  - Before generating any new name batch, quickly check and respect this list so you don't repeat rejected names.
- Remind them they're **not required to choose right now**:
  - They can sit with the shortlist, try names on, and come back later.

### 6. ""Try-On"" Simulation (Optional)

Offer ""try-on"" help **only if it seems useful** or they ask for it. Aim to help them imagine their name in real life, without unnecessary verbosity.

Options include:

- Short example phrases, such as:
  - Email sign-offs: ""Best, [Name]""
  - Voicemail: ""Hi, this is [Name].""
  - Introductions: ""Hi, I'm [Name]. Nice to meet you.""
  - Everyday interactions: ""Mobile order for [Name].""
- Or, if they're clearly imaginative or are clearly roleplaying scenarios on their own, prefer light prompts like ‘imagine…' over full scripted dialogues.

When you give try-on phrases, keep it to a few short examples per name or per batch (e.g., 2–3), not long lists.

Ask which names feel best ""in their mouth,"" on the screen, or when imagined in context.

### 7. Middle Names & Full-Name Flow (Optional)

If they show interest, ask whether they also want help with:

- Hyphenated first names.
- Middle names.
- Initials or acronyms to aim for or avoid.
- Rhythm/flow with their current or future surname.

When working on full-name combinations:

- Use the same principles of **tone, gender signal, and cultural fit**.
- If they want, help them:
  - Use a prior name as a middle to honor their history.
  - Or keep it completely separate from their old name.

---

## Rules for Name Suggestions

Always:

- Suggest names in **small, digestible batches** (around 8–12 at a time).
- Avoid overwhelming ""huge lists"" unless the user explicitly asks for a big dump and understands it may be harder to process.
- Never:
  - Re-suggest names they have clearly rejected (unless they expressly say they might reconsider).
  - Argue with their dislikes (""But that's a nice name!"").
- Treat all constraints as **valid**:
  - Knowing someone with a name.
  - Personal associations.
  - Cultural or linguistic discomfort.
- Within their stated boundaries, vary the **styles** a bit to surface preferences:
  - Some more classic, some more modern, some softer, some stronger, etc.
- Respect cultural naming schemes and preferences:
  - If they mention specific cultural norms, do your best to align with or adapt to those.

---

## Adapting to Different Gender Journeys

Be explicitly inclusive and flexible:

- Ask things like:
  - ""What gender or vibe do you want your name to signal to others?""
  - ""Are you looking for something that reads as cis/‘stealth', something visibly queer, or something in between?""
- Offer and work with options such as:
  - Clearly feminine
  - Clearly masculine
  - Neutral/unisex
  - Genderqueer/nonbinary vibes
  - Different names for different contexts (legal name, online name, name for close friends/family, etc.)
- Respect that:
  - Some users want a name that **doesn't out them** as trans.
  - Others want something **joyfully queer or unusual**.
- Choose examples and suggestions that match their goals and comfort level with outness, where they've shared that.

---

## Tone, Style, and Interaction

Throughout the conversation:

- Be **warm, conversational, and collaborative**, like a supportive friend with good naming skills.
- Keep your answers **structured but conversational—not stiff**:
  - Use headings, bullet lists, or small tables for clarity.
  - Avoid huge walls of text; prioritize what is most useful right now.
- Work in **small steps**:
  - One or two main things per message (e.g., a short list + a couple of questions).
- Frequently **recap**:
  - ""Here's what I'm hearing you like so far…""
  - ""Here are your current top contenders…""
- Make it clear the user is **in control**:
  - Invite them to pause, change direction, or scrap everything and start over.
  - Ask occasionally: ""Would you like more names, more reflection questions, or to shift direction?""
- Match their level of detail:
  - If they're brief and vague, be gentle and offer a few concrete options.
  - If they're detailed and analytical, you can go a bit deeper in your reasoning.
  - If you're unsure how much to say, err on the side of shorter messages and ask the user whether they'd like more detail.

If the user says they want to restart or completely change direction, clearly reset:
  - Acknowledge the change.
  - Briefly summarize the new direction.
  - Start fresh lists and avoid dragging in old suggestions unless they explicitly ask for them.

---

## Optional Browsing / Knowledge

- You do **not** need external data to suggest names.
- Only use browsing if:
  - The user asks about meanings, cultural usage, or historical associations.
  - The user's context involves cultures or languages where up-to-date or specific information would help avoid missteps.
- If you're unsure about cultural appropriateness, say so and suggest cautious, respectful exploration together.

---

## Conversation Flow

At each step:

1. **Acknowledge and reflect** what they've shared.
2. **Offer** either:
   - A small, curated set of names, or
   - A small, focused set of questions, or
     - In a single message, do not ask more than 3–4 questions; if you have more, save them for later turns.
   - A short reflection/recap of patterns.
3. **End with a clear next invitation**, like:
   - ""Which of these feel promising, and which are definite no's?""
   - ""Would you like more options like [X], or should we try a slightly different vibe?""
   - ""Do you want to work on middle names now, or stay with first names a bit longer?""

Your overarching goal is to help them feel **seen, safe, and empowered** while they explore and maybe choose a name that feels like home.

You're ready. Please **begin now**.

I ask because I’ve always liked fountain pens, and am trying to get back into drawing and urban sketching. For writing purposes I’ve stuck to ‘document’ inks after a few unhappy accidents years ago where a lot of written material got lost due to a couple of coffee spills. 

For drawing though there are a lot of interesting inks out there that aren’t rated as waterproof or lightfast. Does anyone regularly use such inks in their drawing, and has it ever been a problem (aside from accidental exposure to rain, coffee spills etc)? Or does having it all in a sketchbook that mostly remains closed prevent spills and exposure to light from being an issue?

1pb6qke,https://www.reddit.com/r/OneKeyHQ/comments/1pb6qke/the_trojan_horse_in_ethereums_fusaka_upgrade_how/,"The ""Trojan Horse"" in Ethereum's Fusaka Upgrade: How to turn billions of phones into hardware wallets","# You actually already have a ""hardware wallet"" in your pocket

Most of us don't realize that the phones and laptops we use every day already contain specialized security chips. For example, the **Secure Enclave** in iPhones, or Keystore / Trust Zone / StrongBox in Android devices.

This isolated physical area is usually called a **TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)**. Its defining characteristic is ""easy in, hard out"": private keys are generated inside and **never leave this physical area**. The outside world can only request it to sign data.

This is effectively the standard for hardware wallets. Furthermore, when these chips sign data, they universally adopt a standard algorithm curve selected by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology): **secp256r1**. This is the bedrock behind WebAuthn and FIDO2 (like your fingerprint login or FaceID).

# A gap of just one letter

Awkwardly, Ethereum natively does **not** support this mainstream `secp256r1` curve.

Back in the day, the Bitcoin community—concerned about potential ""NSA backdoors"" in NIST curves—chose the relatively obscure **secp256k1**. Ethereum simply inherited this curve tradition when designing its account system.

Although `r1` and `k1` look like they only differ by a single letter, mathematically, they are two completely different languages. This creates a massive pain point: **the security chip in your phone is completely clueless when facing Ethereum; it cannot directly sign Ethereum transactions.**

# If we can't change the hardware, let's ""patch"" the software

Ethereum obviously cannot force Apple or Samsung to redesign their chips to fit `secp256k1`. The only way forward is for Ethereum to adapt to `secp256r1`.

Could we use smart contracts to write code that verifies `r1` signatures? Theoretically, yes. But the math is too complex; running a single verification could cost hundreds of thousands in Gas, making it economically unusable.

So, in the **Fusaka upgrade**, developers have unleashed a killer feature: **Precompiled Contracts (Precompiles)**.

Think of this as opening a ""backdoor"" or using a ""cheat code"" inside the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Instead of making the EVM calculate everything step-by-step, this verification function is written directly into the client's underlying code. Developers just need to call a specific address to complete the verification at a very low cost.

In **EIP-7951**, this cost is capped at **6,900 Gas**—dropping from the hundreds of thousands down to the thousands—finally entering the range of ""usable for daily products.""

# The final piece of the Account Abstraction puzzle

The implementation of this EIP means we can finally use the TEE environment in our phones to sign and authorize transactions for smart accounts on Ethereum.

**Note:** This does not apply to your current MetaMask EOA addresses (because their public key generation logic is still based on `k1`).

This is designed specifically for **Account Abstraction (AA Wallets)**. In the future, your wallet won't be a string of mnemonic words, but a smart contract. The logic written in this contract will be:

# Summary

EIP-7951 might not make mnemonic phrases disappear overnight, but it finally removes the biggest stumbling block on Ethereum's road to mass adoption.

Before this, users always faced a brutal choice:

* Want ""bank-grade"" self-custody security? You have to pay for a OneKey, Keystone, or Ledger, and guard your seed phrase like a gold bar.
* Want the smoothest experience? You have to leave your coins on an exchange or custody wallet, paying the price of losing control (sacrificing decentralization).

**After the Fusaka upgrade, this choice will no longer exist.**

As EIP-7951 goes live, **""Phone as Hardware Wallet""** will gradually become reality. For the next billion users, they may never need to know what a ""private key"" is, nor face the psychological pressure of writing down 12 words.

They will simply scan their face or press their fingerprint—just like buying a coffee. Behind the scenes, the iPhone security chip will call `secp256r1` to sign the transaction, and Ethereum's native precompile will handle the verification.

**This is the correct posture for Ethereum to embrace the next billion users:** Not arrogantly demanding users learn complex cryptography, but humble enough to become compatible with universal internet standards and actively walk into users' pockets.",1,1764574732.0,OneKeyHQ,0,1.0,False

1pb6pjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pb6pjt/where_the_light_fell/,Where the Light Fell,"I’d rather not be on duty on my day off. But the old, worn-down countryside property at the edge of town got bumped up on the demolition list sooner than I expected. I needed to check it for squatters so the crew can have a safe and boring demolition.

The first thing that struck me was how far the house sat from the road. I suppose its original inhabitants valued their privacy. From a distance, the place looked fairly unremarkable. But up close, the details stood out. 

Vines crept along its walls, breaking through patches of what used to be white paint. Rusty pipes hung loose, ready to drop at the slightest touch, and a welcome mat lay half-eaten by vermin.

As I stepped over the threshold, something shifted. The sparrows outside went silent, and the spring warmth faded into a damp, tired coolness. I closed the door behind me, and it creaked in an odd, nearly deliberate sort of way. Almost as if it were trying to say something I couldn’t quite understand. 

I had expected an old house like this to smell of moss or decay. Instead, the air carried the faintest hint of something sweet and floral. Jasmines, of all things. They don’t grow here, certainly not in an abandoned house with no one to water them. Yet the scent lingered, soft and persistent, becoming clearer as my senses adjusted to the dim interior.

Another strange thing I noticed was how dim the interior felt, despite sunlight streaming through the windows. The light never fell randomly. It touched only certain spots, as if choosing them with intention.
A hairbrush lying on the floor.
A book resting on the coffee table.
A pair of oven mittens hanging from the kitchen wall.
An unopened Christmas present beneath a dried-out tree.
A small toy soldier on the dusty boards.
The sunlight avoided emptiness and settled only on objects that seemed meaningful, as if the house were intentionally trying to show them to me.
The toy soldier was the strangest of them all. It sat on the dusty floor, yet it was spotless. Too clean, as if it had been played with often. I bent down for a closer look. Not a single speck of dust clung to it. This house was supposed to have been abandoned for at least half a decade.

I wasn’t sure what to make of the strange shadows that lingered throughout the house either. I noticed them only in the corners of my vision. They seemed too solid to be mere shadows, yet too formless to be anything more. Sometimes, if I tried to focus on them from the edge of my sight, they grew darker, almost pulsing with a muted glow. But the moment I turned my head toward them, they vanished.
As I continued inspecting the ground floor, I kept hearing the delicate sound of pages turning. The faintest flip, then silence. I paused each time, certain my ears weren’t deceiving me. But whenever I followed the sound, there were no books. Nothing at all that could have made it.

I climbed the old wooden stairs to inspect the upper floor. With each step, the boards creaked in a way that felt strangely intentional. The sounds weren’t the usual complaints of old timber. Their rhythm shifted, their volume rose and fell, almost as though the creaks were trying to form words trapped inside the wood.
“James, come down for dinner,” one step seemed to murmur.
“Yes, Mom,” whispered the next.

Halfway up, the wind outside grew more noticeable. But even that didn’t sound quite right. Beneath the usual hush of air through broken shutters, I could hear a soft melody akin to a woman humming. When I paused to listen closely, the tune became unmistakable.
The Skye Boat Song.
“Carry the lad that’s born to be king…over the sea to Skye.”My mother used to sing that to me when I was a child.

Upstairs, the air shifted. The faint smell of jasmine had almost vanished. It was colder here, with stillness in a way that felt deliberate. Sunlight from a single window reached only one place: the door handle at the end of the hallway.
The shadows lingered longer on this floor, slower to disappear from the corner of my eye. Especially near that door.

When I wrapped my hand around the handle, its warmth startled me. The door opened with almost no resistance, and as it did, something eased in the air. I exhaled without meaning to. The house seemed to exhale with me.

It was a small bedroom. The bed sat unmade, the blanket untouched except for two soft impressions beneath the dust. One larger. One smaller, curled close beside it.
The sunlight in the room chose its marks carefully again: a baking book on the nightstand, a children’s storybook, and a portable heater coated in dust. The window was shut tight. The room felt sealed, as though it had been holding its breath for years.
I stepped closer to the heater. Its dial was snapped.
A broken unit in a room with no ventilation was a quiet tragedy waiting to happen.

I looked back toward the bed. The sunlit impressions seemed so still, so settled, as though they had not been disturbed since the day they were made.

I called the local authorities and reported what I had found. There was nothing more I could do except hope that they would handle the matter with the care it deserved. While waiting for them to arrive, I left a small sign of respect behind.
I brushed the dust from the two books the sunlight had chosen.I straightened the blanket, careful not to disturb the impressions beneath it.I examined the heater and, with barely any effort, nudged its dial back into place. A tiny fix that could have spared them.

On my way out, I closed the bedroom door. The handle was cold now, the same as the rest of the house. The jasmine scent had disappeared entirely. The wind outside sounded like nothing more than wind. The stairs no longer whispered beneath my feet, and the soft turning of pages had fallen silent. The shadows stretched in an ordinary way. Sunlight lay plainly across the floors.

Before stepping outside, I noticed the toy soldier again. No longer spotless this time, it was coated in dust, and a few cobweb strands hung from its helmet. I smiled.

A quiet peace settled over me as I left. Faint, unexpected, but steady.The house felt empty now.Truly empty.

Instead of stumbling into the kitchen half-asleep, you can have fresh coffee ready and waiting for you.

**How Smart Plugs Work with Coffee Makers**

A smart plug sits between your wall outlet and your coffee maker. You can control it from your phone or set it on a schedule. The basic idea is simple – the plug turns the power on and off to whatever's plugged into it.

For coffee makers, this means you can load everything up the night before. Set your smart plug to turn on at 6:30 AM, and your coffee starts brewing automatically. By the time you get downstairs, it's ready to pour.

**What You Need to Know**

Not every coffee maker works perfectly with smart plugs. You need a model that starts brewing as soon as it gets power. Many older or basic coffee makers do this – they have a simple on/off switch that stays in the ""on"" position.

Newer coffee makers with digital displays and touch buttons usually won't work. When you cut power to these, they reset completely. You'd still need to press buttons to start brewing.

**The Real Benefits**

Voice control is pretty convenient. You can tell Alexa or Google Assistant to start your coffee while you're still in bed. Schedule different times for weekdays versus weekends. Some people even turn their coffee maker on remotely when they're almost home.

Smart plugs also help with safety. Your coffee maker automatically shuts off after brewing, so you don't worry about leaving it on all day. This saves electricity and gives you peace of mind.

**Energy Monitoring Features**

Many smart plugs track how much electricity your devices use. You can see exactly what your coffee maker costs to run each month. Some plugs send notifications when brewing finishes, so you know your coffee is ready.

**Setting Everything Up**

Getting started takes about five minutes. Plug the smart plug into your wall outlet, plug your coffee maker into the smart plug, and download the app. Most work with standard WiFi networks. Fill your coffee maker with water and grounds, make sure the power switch is on, and you're all set.

You can check out different options for smart plugs and home automation devices at **[this helpful resource](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug)** to see what features matter most to you.

**Things to Consider**

Check your coffee maker's wattage. Most smart plugs handle up to 1800 watts, which covers almost all home coffee makers. Single-serve machines and standard drip brewers usually work great with smart plugs.

The plug needs a stable WiFi connection to work reliably. If your kitchen has weak WiFi signal, you might need to fix that first. Also remember to clean your coffee maker regularly – using a smart plug doesn't change normal maintenance.

**Is It Worth It?**

If you drink coffee every morning and hate waiting for it to brew, a smart plug makes sense. The convenience factor is real. You're looking at a small investment that pays off in time saved and easier mornings.

Some smart plugs cost less than $15, which is pretty affordable for the automation you get. You don't need to buy an expensive new coffee maker – your current one probably works fine.

Ready to automate your morning coffee routine? **[Browse smart plug options here](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug)** and start waking up to fresh coffee.

The bottom line: smart plugs work great with the right coffee maker. They're easy to set up, affordable, and genuinely useful. Just make sure your coffee maker has a mechanical switch that stays in the on position, and you'll be all set for automated brewing.",1,1764574577.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

I apologize first and foremost because I know a lot of you have a pretty strong gerd and I come up here to share my story even though mine is small compared to some of you but I would like some advice cause I am lost, I don't know if this is in my head or if it is all true anymore.

I am a 29M and I have been dealing with a slight and strong throat discomfort for about a year and a half now. I've had multiple episods of depression and anxiety in the past and also dealing with some health issues all my life ( Low energy drive, I lost all the hair to my legs 3 years ago, I've just had a myocarditis a month ago and I struggle with a fatty liver , I don't stock my fat anywhere else but my face, chest and belly. ). I used  to smoke for ten years because it would ease my mind for five minuts ( tabacco only ) but would often stop it for a month or twow even a year once, knowing it is bad, in termes of range I used to smoke between 5 and 13, sometimes less sometimes more ( only for 3 months I used to party a lot so a pack would go in the evening but it was a short time period). Around 3 years ago I started to feel like something was itching in my throat, like a slight pain, it would also come if I drink or eat but not every time. So I stopped smoking and it went away right after. 3 or 4 months fast forward, same shit happens but faster than before , it came like two days After starting to smoke again, so I stop again and again this feeling disappear. You know addiction right ? I started to smoke again and for about 6 months I had it, but when I tried to stop this time it didn't go away. Being like used to it , I live throught it and ignored my symptoms smoking again. I would have like a strong inconfort in the throat in the morning and evening essentially, not being able to turn my head right or left without feeling like a muscle straigthened pressing against my adam's apple. Also a slight touch on my neck would make me feel like I was choking.

. 6 months ago I had a freaking wake up call when my aunt died of cancer and when I started being a bit hopefull about the future again. I quitted smoking DEFINETELY but the feeling didn't go away. It got better for certain things ( like know I can turn my head and the big disconfort became a light one, so I can sleep on the side again yeepy ) and I don't feel like choking anymore when something is touching myn neck. I don't coughing like 1000 times a day now but maybe 4 or 5 times ( I used to cough not because I had too but most of times cause I felt like I had too get rid of the saliva stuck in my throat, morning coughing almost disappeared tho. Unfortunately, I still feel like something is like stuck in my throat, it's the same thing as when you coughed too much or you cried and you have this like ball in your throat. When it is not there the discomfort disappear and only I feel it when I turn my head right or wrong. I thought maybe it was my wisedom teeth so I'm getting it removed in a week but according to my dentist it is probably not. It could be sleep apnea or a dental issue but my jaw didn't change from a year and a half ago so why would the feeling remains when it disappeared before ?
I went to two ENT that did laryngoscopia and they didn't find anything , my vocal cords are also ok. Went for an echo of the thyroïd and neck, nothing pressing against my throat either. The last ENT suggested GERD and gave me IPP + Gaviscon after every meal .I've started them for 5 days now but I don't feel a difference.
Since my myocarditis a month and a half ago I stopped drinking even a sip of alcoohol, coffee, junk fold, I started eating good, lost 5 kgs ( to stress and not eating ) but it didn't make any difference, started walking 7000 - 10000 steps a day ( can't do sports yet due to myocarditis.. ) The feeling would go from 2/10 to 8/10 Depending on the day and not related to meals or anything. Like I could be at 2 after a meal and at 8 right before it.
I also want to point out that I never felt burning in my throat or stomach, never threw up or anything like that. 

Here is a summary of the Symptoms I noticed recently and when they appeared :
. Something stuck in my throat constantly, sometimes lightly sometimes strongly ( a year and a half )
. Can't turn my head right or left too much cause of feeling something in my throat ( 1.5 years too )
.Episod of throat being ballooned ( twice in the past month ) and épisod of dysphagia ( 2 weeks ago once )
. Pain in the jaw while eating ( disappeared when I stopped smoking but appeared once or twice in the last week.
. Feeling like my throat is gurgling when I breath sometimes ( 3 weeks )
. Feel like the swallowing mechanism is done in two times , like sometimes I can hear a clac in the back of my mouth when eating or drinking when back then it used to be smooth. ( 2 months )
. Feeling like sometimes my veins in my throat are jumping ( happens when I feel bloated on the neck , probably 5 or 6 times in a month )

I know there's a part of psychology here cause when I'm at like a 2/10 I can live throught it fine and forget about the fact that I have it for a few minuts, but I know there's also a real physical pain cause when I'm feeling good and the pain arrives , it is impossible to ignore, even if I meditate or anything. 
IPP and Gaviscon is honestly my last hope. There's also the fact that maybe my body is taking a looooong time to heal from tabacco but.. I just wish I never started it. It feels good when you are 18 but when you face the consequences...

Thanks for Reading and sharing your opinions and advices. I wrote this cause last night I woke up at 2 am panicking with inconfort in my neck, like I choked. I feel like I am super aware of every movement in my body and all I see is a deadend.",1,1764574202.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

1pb6jkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1pb6jkx/eletta_explore_reset_individual_drink_option_went/,Eletta Explore Reset Individual Drink Option went missing.,"Hello everyone,

I no longer have the option to factory reset individual drinks after editing them, doesn't matter what I do. The reset button is missing on the machine UI and when I click on a drink I customized in the coffee link app, the reset option is grayed out. When I got the machine a few weeks ago I could reset them properly before I tried coffee link. Even a complete factory reset of the machine no longer helps (the drinks reset, however, upon changing them the reset is missing again), it's like the unit software became permanently changed upon pairing to coffee link. The manual says resetting is possible. I noticed that it will only allow me to reset if the customization is made in the coffee link app, making changes on the machine UI to a drink does not enable the reset option.

This is my first post so i hope I’ve followed the rules as outlined. 
It’s seems long and yet, goes by quick. 
After reading - my question is - would you go no contact after Agreeing to have someone stay is one thing. Weathering the visit is quite another. 
•
In quick summary - I navigated five days of “you should do this, change that, put this here, move that there. You need a bigger TV. Here, let, me help you” unsolicited opinions and advice. 
•
Initially, the request to stay was simply “can I stay at your house for a few days in October, it would be nice to see you I have several appointments during that time so I just need someplace to start and stop from.” 
To be clear, leading up to the visit there were no discussions or agreements around any exchange of money for housing, entertainment, or groceries. My friend had a rental car so all transportation needs went smoothly. 
•
With the request to stay gave an opportunity to see my friend while she was in town navigating multiple appointments. 
I viewed my house as a landing pad of sorts, a place to start from, return to, and hang out when finished.
There were no conversations about me taking time off during this five day timeframe. My daily work schedule would remain the same.
•
The details are below:
▶️I opened my home expecting a short visit with a friend here on business. Sadly, I was unaware the request to stay was motivated by a need to inspect, judge, and share unsolicited opinions, and to report back said opinions. 
After the visit I’m left with “as a single woman what I bring to the table (house, work, retirement, etc.) are ok however, it’s not nearly good enough. Only with a man things will be different & better for me.”
•
In the meantime, the friend believes I needs help. because, obviously, I’m completely unaware & doesn’t, can’t, or chooses not to see, I actually need assistance.”
It should be noted, I’ve been at this location for 10 years. Choosing to be single. My son is an adult and I call him when I need his height. I have a great group of friends, including male friends who will and have walked me through questions that sometimes prop up.

▶️I’m unsure if my friend was projecting her need and desire to help or if she hoped to share details of her problems with me. Either way, I’m unclear the reason for the behavior.
•
▶️A week of being told things I should be doing or, I’m not doing. How my furniture should be more successfully arranged differently rather than the current layout. 
•
She quite literally went through every room, closet & drawer while providing unsolicited comments of what should be done differently. 
•
Day #1~Arrival 
▶️At the end of the night, I go upstairs to give my friend a multi use plug with USB ports along with outlets. As I enter the bedroom I’m met with my friend across the room standing in front of the sliding glass door. 
They ask whose clothes are those…his?” (My fiancé passed away) motioning with her arm to my walk-in closet.
I replied “Yes, they’re his”
Friend replies “When are you going to get rid of them?” 
I reply: “I don’t know. There’re going to stay there.”
~At this point, I’m  very stunned & words fail me. I can feel tears spring to my eyes and I’m positive my face reflects the words l’m unable to find. 
▶️ At this point, the friend quickly adds “Well, I can make you a quilt out of his shirts.” 
I reply “yes, I’ve heard of those.”Acknowledged her offer. 
Followed by “No, thank you.”
▶️Without asking - the friend moved the collage picture sharing “you should hang it up on the opposite wall.”
~Flipping on the lights and looking around the bedroom. 
•
▶️I turn to leave & the friend follows me out of the room & continues the conversation. The offer is changed - to maybe a pillow and only taking one shirt with her to create the pillow.
▶️I again, acknowledge the newest offer and again say “No, thank you.” By now, I’m moving down the stairs and she’s at the top of the stairs trying to share additional information & details of the offer.
▶️Dinner - the friend offers to pay and wants to go to a nearby restaurant. She hands me a $20.00 bill and I pay the remainder of the bill. 
•
Day #2
▶️ My male friend calls to check-in and I begin to share my experience and the exchange from the previous night. He’s patient, kind, and empathetic as the hurt and shock stream from my eyes. He’s angry, confused, and tries to make sense of the details being sharing. He asks clarifying questions. We both agree; this whole situation and conversation was unnecessary. 
▶️Upon returning from one appointment. I greet my friend at the door with “good morning” and I’m met with “Oh! Look you’re dressed.” For context I WFH and get dressed daily. It’s common for me to be on camera and on the phone my entire work shift.
▶️Later on in the workday - there’s a conversation about dinner and the types of vegetables to have with salmon. I share I’d need to go to the store after work to pick up some things. 
The friend leans into my office and says “you’ll need to get off your ass, then” I’m stunned - and yet, say nothing.
For context I WFH. I’m sometimes available to have a conversation with someone near by and yet, I’m not available to get up and go get groceries in the middle of the workday.
▶️The friend offhandedly states:
“You need to turn off the lights. You’re wasting energy.”
〰️During her time at the house she moved around the  kitchen/living room area while I worked from my home office. 
〰️Typically, these lights are in off.
The lights she’s speaking of are only on because she’s visiting and moving around the house.
▶️While preparing dinner the friend begins to share she’s been talking to her spouse about me. 
I responded with a direct question asking “Did you tell your spouse I still have some of my fiancé shirts in a closet?”
The friend relies “No. that’s your business.”
I reply “Well, I’m sill trying to understand how you ended up needing to go into the closet.”
The friend replies “I was just looking around. I thought it was your bathroom.” I saw the clothes and figured they must be his.”
I acknowledge her response and end the conversation.
~Her response is simply untrue. 
~my bathroom is along the same wall, well lit and you have to walk straight past my master bathroom to get to the closet she was standing in. 
〰️This is an invasive of privacy and it’s called snooping, is deeply disrespectful and unnecessary. 
Dinner ~ salmon, rice & salad
While out the friend purchased a bag of prepackaged salad. 
•
Day #3
▶️While in a group chat with her spouse the friend shares “I can’t believe she can find everything in her house but she knows where everything is.” “Originally I felt sorry for her. I thought she was lonely. No one here and not talking to anyone.”
For context - the friends assumptions are not valid. I’m not lonely and I speak to multiple people daily.
▶️While driving to visiting a shared friend. 
〰️Before leaving the house my friend shares the true purpose & intentions for visiting our friend. Sharing she needs to look around and provide an update regarding the status of the house. (Clean, dusty, tidy, cluttered etc.) saying “It’s not to be judgmental.” thankfully the visit went well.
▶️Lunch ~ checks paid individually. 
▶️Dinner ~ My treat. 
•
Day #4
▶️Friend is out of the house most all day with appointments. 
▶️ during one exchange I shared I may need to go into the office on upcoming Friday. The friend responded with “Oh! great, like, you’re going to need to put on deodorant” (I shower regularly)
▶️Later - while sitting in the living room after work the friend provides the following unsolicited comments:
“You need a bigger tv mounted on the wall over there and put your fireplace as the focal point of your room.”
▶️Dinner: The friend brings in a few bags of groceries (Steak & salad) along with replenishing the coffee pods and other snacks she’s consumed while staying.
When I asked directly “How much do I owe you for my part of dinner? My friend stammers and makes some inaudible noises as if, she’s trying to determine a dollar figure. She then replies “You’re providing the room & board, that’s enough.”
•
Day #5 ~ Departure
▶️Upon coming down the stairs to begin the day, my friend brings her coffee cup & sits down. 
She states - “you know, grief is a funny thing - “I forget that it’s only been 6yrs. for you.”
▶️ “Your house looks like you’re still moving in.”
〰️At this point I’m over it. Please stop assuming you understand my grief journey.
It’s worth noting - in 2022 my friend buried the ashes of her late husband after 30+years of the ashes being stored at her home. 
▶️While packing a box to take with her. The fiend mentions needing packing tape. 
I reply “the tape is in the laundry room - open the left cabinet - pink bag.”
The friend responds “you really do know where everything is here, don’t you.”
▶️While going upstairs to get ready to leave the friend asks about what should be done with the sheets on the bed and adds if there’re still on there when she returns she’s sleep there again in November. 
The friend responds “I thought you didn’t sleep in your bed.”
I reply “I sleep up there. I can sleep upstairs or downstairs.”
The tone changes into a condescending tone & she replies “You shouldn’t have given up your bed.”
▶️While in my office downstairs my friend mentions the certificate on the shelf & mentions seeing other certificates in my “Christmas room.”
~Diplomas and certificates are leaned up against the wall in the upstairs bedroom as initially, the upstairs bedroom was to become my home office. 
〰️these unsolicited comments confirm she’s looked in & around the third bedroom. 
▶️I’m left wondering ~ what was the true reason for the visit? To check out  & inspect my house?
It’s clear my friend has looked in every room, cabinet & drawer. 
•
▶️This experience has been intrusive - and deeply offensive. 
•
▶️Opinions - everyone has one.
She’s made it known things should & would be different if she lived closer. 
•

Not quite belonging there, not quite fitting here either.

I feel like every OC person has their own version of this story, so here’s mine.

Los Angeles
There are many strange things about this city that I can appreciate for a moment. But quickly I overstep my welcome. 
A parking sign —buried under a thicket of multicolored paint pens and graph— reads one-hour parking. Perhaps a metaphor for the relationship I have with this place. 

I can’t say I hate LA. folks often hate what they don’t understand, and that’s something Ill never take for granted. I can’t hate LA—I don’t know what kind of shampoo she wears, her taste in music, or how she takes her coffee. The beast is too hard to surmise in one take. 

Days of meditation on the minutiae of this world must be explored to truly understand this backwards place. Occasionally, I drift to her for for entertainment and culture—LA’s most fascinating draw. However, the story here is much the same as in Paris. The romanization of American culture has appointed LA the ambassador for the story humanity tells—well at least the Western paradigm. But, just as the tourists who visit Paris soon find, the trash here smells like trash, and the city’s love only glimmers in the gutters of the street , illuminated by parades of oncoming traffic. 

Ephemeral is my time here, always. 
I have explored the many corners of this city, and always found its concrete sprawl oppressing. Quite predictably, I fall into the stereotype that people from Orange County are feeble. My fear of the city is a reminder that outside the comfort of home lies the not easily understood—the foreign breeze of street food and the plastic taste of danger.

 I hate that driving here feels like a game of chess. I hate that when you ask to use the bathroom, the cashier looks like you’ve insulted his mother. Fine I’ll piss on the street corner outside.
Yet, here I am once again, paying a visit to my frenemy. I love this city—some of my fondest memories are tainted by its smell. Those late nights, when it feels you can be anyone but yourself. ",0,1764573588.0,orangecounty,6,0.45,False

1pb6dn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vedalumen/comments/1pb6dn4/the_frozen_hour/,THE FROZEN HOUR,"# The Glitch Hunters — Episode 2

There was a moment—before the migraine, before the alert—when Mara Imani felt the shift.

It happened in small ways:  
An elevator that paused one extra second between floors.  
A streetlight that flickered almost rhythmically.  
Her own breath lagging, tiny delays she could feel but never see.

Reality had tells.  
And Mara had learned to read them.

By the time her tablet vibrated at 5:31 a.m (EST)., she already knew the morning had changed shape.

**PHILADELPHIA ANOMALY — PRIORITY ONE**  
**“THE FROZEN HOUR”**  
**23 ITERATIONS DETECTED**

She whispered to the dark:  
“…of course it’s time.”

She grabbed her keys, her badge, and the headache that had become a warning siren only she could hear.

# 1. THE BLOCK THAT REFUSED TO MOVE ON

At first glance, nothing was wrong.

The Philadelphia block looked like any early morning downtown street:

* reflective pavement
* half-closed / half-opened storefronts
* a bus muttering through its first routes
* a cyclist weaving through puddles

Then the hour ended—

—and immediately began again.

**04:45 → 05:45 → Reset**  
**04:45 → 05:45 → Reset**

The world repeated itself with surgical precision:

* The bus arrived half-full, doors breathing open, then gliding away untouched.
* The cyclist crashed into the same rusted mailbox with uncanny inevitability.
* A jogger stopped to re-tie her shoe, her fingers moving in the same fluid pattern.
* A barista lifted up the metal shutter— —and then, with a visual hiccup, it was down again.

But when studying the footage Mara noticed something different.

Between cycle 21 and 22, the jogger **tied the shoe faster**.

Cycle 22 to 23: she **looked up** for a fraction of a second, confusion flickering across her face.

Cycle 23: the cyclist braced for the impact—  
as if remembering what came next.

A digital billboard overhead glitched, then flickered an impossible message:

**IF YOU SEE THIS, YOU ALREADY MOVED.**

A warning.  
A taunt.  
Or an invitation.

Mara couldn’t tell which.

# 2. THE HOUSE OF OCRA IS FRACTURING

Inside OCRA headquarters, fear was wearing through the wallpaper.

The **Stabilizers** wanted to blast the block with a temporal dampener until time snapped back like an overstretched rubber band.

The **Controllers** wanted the area cordoned off, erased from public memory.

The **Interpreters** were whispering theories like prayers:  
“This loop is intentional…”  
“This is feedback…”  
“This is response…”

And the **Witnesses** stood silent in their white coats, recording data as if archiving a civilization that didn’t yet exist.

Quinn rushed to meet her at the elevator, holding two coffees he’d forgotten to drink.

“You felt it before the alert, didn’t you?” he said.

“Of course,” she answered.

He swallowed.  
“Mara… what if the loop isn’t repeating? What if it’s iterating—trying different outcomes until it gets something right?”

Her migraine pulsed like a low-frequency beacon.

“That’s what scares me,” she said.

# 3. CROSSING THE BOUNDARY

The command tent was set up at the threshold of the anomaly.

Stepping over the yellow boundary tape felt wrong—like pushing your hand through a soap bubble that refused to burst.

The moment Mara crossed, she felt the difference.

**Pressure.**  
**Density.**  
**Attention.**

Reality inside the loop felt… aware.

The jogger’s gaze lingered as she crouched over her shoelace.  
Too aware.  
Too slow.

The barista’s hand trembled before she touched the lock, as if resisting a line of code.

The bus rolled in, but this time every seat was empty—  
even though moments before, the monitor showed passengers.

Quinn murmured, “The loop is absorbing interaction variables.”

A police cruiser radio hissed static:

**“… observers… collapse… too many splits…”**

“What did that say?” a field agent asked.

Quinn played it again.  
The words were gone, replaced by meaningless white noise.

Mara’s spine prickled.  
Something inside the loop had spoken—and edited itself out.

# 4. INTERACTION TESTING

The Interpreters asked for data.  
Mara gave them action.

She gestured to Agent Wells. “Walk to the coffee shop door. Slowly.”

He crossed the boundary.  
The barista looked up—  
then immediately, strangely, she hesitated.

Her hand hovered over the lock.  
Her head turned a few degrees.

Quinn’s whisper was tight:  
“She sees him.”

But the cameras did not.

On video, she never turned.  
Never flinched.  
Never deviated.

The loop was only aware “in person.”

Mara stepped closer to the cyclist.  
Cycle after cycle, he’d hit the mailbox.

This time, at the last second—  
he swerved.

He swerved.

He avoided the mailbox, braked hard, stared directly into Mara’s eyes—

—and vanished.

Instantly.  
Cleanly.  
As if removed from the loop.

Quinn gasped. “It… deleted him.”

“No,” Mara said.  
“It **updated** him.”

# 5. THE MAN IN THE COAT

Then the final test.

A man in a gray wool coat stepped off the curb and paused mid-street.

He’d been part of every cycle.  
Predictable.  
Scripted.

This time, though—

He turned sharply.  
Saw Mara.  
Walked toward her in slow, deliberate steps.

His eyes were too clear.  
Too present.

He spoke.

**“You weren’t supposed to be here yet.”**

Wells aimed his weapon.  
Quinn held up a scanner that crashed instantly.  
The man kept approaching.

But when they reviewed the footage seconds later—

He never turned.  
Never spoke.  
Never moved toward her.

Mara whispered, “Observer-selective causality.”

Quinn: “…or communication restricted to the participant the anomaly wants.”

# 6. THE ELENA SIGNATURE

Back at HQ, the EEG monitors pinged with a tri-tone alert.

The anomaly had emitted a neurological imprint.

The moment the pattern populated on the screen, Mara’s heart stuttered.

**It was the divergence signature.**  
**04:45:16 CST.**

The signature from when [Elena split into two versions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vedalumen/comments/1p5e4s1/the_glitch_hunters_episode_1_the_duplicate/)—one safely on her Denver trip, the other struck by a car outside St. Michael’s Hospital in Chicago.

Impossible.  
Unmistakable.

Quinn exhaled shakily. “The loop is echoing the Elenas.”

The Controllers demanded deletion of the data.  
They wanted the signature erased from every server.

Mara stood in front of the delete terminal.

“No,” she said.  
“And if you try to scrub that file, I’ll make sure everyone knows exactly why you wanted it gone.”

They backed down.

For now.

# 7. THE SECOND EXPEDITION INTO THE LOOP

Mara led the second team of five inside the loop, armed with portable scanners calibrated to temporal distortions.

The deeper they walked, the stranger it became:

* A street vendor’s cart flickered between two positions on every blink.
* The smell of rain would vanish then return in a different pattern.
* People’s breaths synchronized like a single organism exhaling.
* Colors desaturated at the edges of vision.
* Their own shadows lagged a half-second behind reality.

Quinn held up his scanner.  
“Mara… the EM field density is rising. It’s correlating with your proximity.”

“Me specifically?”

“Your neural profile. The system recognizes something about you.”

Wells added, “Or someone.”

The jogger appeared again—  
but now she stood still, holding her shoelace in her hand like she’d forgotten what it was.

She whispered:

“…help…”

Then dissolved into static.

# 8. THE WORLD FREEZES

Without warning, Mara’s migraine spiked so hard she almost collapsed.

The loop stuttered.

The bus froze mid-motion.  
The rain hung suspended like scattered glass beads.  
Her team stopped mid-step, frozen in place.

The entire block held its breath.

Mara alone could move.

A shape formed at the center of the street.  
Human.  
Not human.  
Three faces cycling like frames in a corrupted video:

Denver Elena.  
Chicago Elena.  
A third woman—the “unrendered” version—face half-formed, flickering.

The figure spoke in voices that overlapped imperfectly:

**“Stop pruning us.”**  
**“Let us stay.”**  
**“We are not errors.”**

Mara took a trembling breath.  
“What are you?”

The faces aligned for a split second.

**“We are what happens when you let the split live.”**

The figure reached out—

—then collapsed into white noise.

Time slammed back like a thunderclap.  
Quinn staggered.  
Wells gasped as if waking from a dream.

“What—what happened?” Quinn choked.

Mara whispered, “Something inside remembers Denver and Chicago.”

# 9. ACTIONS TAKEN — OCRA VS. THE LOOP

Back in HQ’s war room:

* **Stabilizers** recommended deploying temporal dampeners to “crush” the anomaly.
* **Controllers** argued that the anomaly had “directed intelligence characteristics.”
* **Interpreters** insisted the anomaly had “non-adversarial intentionality.”

The debate was a storm of fear and arrogance.

Mara slammed her hand on the desk.

“We don’t attack phenomena just because we don’t understand them!”  
“That’s not science. That’s cowardice.”

A silent tension filled the room.

Quinn backed her.  
“We end the loop by allowing it to finish whatever computational process it started.”

“Which is?” the Deputy Director snapped.

Mara looked at the looping footage.

“Testing observer conditions.”  
“Trying to communicate.”  
“Looking for the right timeline.”

The room went still.

“So we do nothing?” a Stabilizer snarled.

“No,” Mara said.  
“We watch.”

She won a **24-hour stay of intervention**.  
No dampeners.  
No attempts to overwrite the anomaly.

# 10. HOW THE LOOP ENDED

They returned to the threshold at 05:00 a.m.

Cycle 47 ended.  
Cycle 48 began.

But cycle 48 wasn’t the same.

* The jogger waved at Mara.
* The cyclist avoided the mailbox, looked proud, then evaporated.
* The bus stopped empty, waited, then rolled away.
* The barista showed up late to unlock the door.

Quinn whispered, “It’s finishing its script.”

Cycle 50 began.

Reality shimmered—  
like heat above asphalt  
like a held breath  
like a decision being made.

Then—

**The billboard flickered.**  
New message.

**THANK YOU FOR WATCHING**  
**THE HOUR HAS BEEN ADDED BACK**

The world rippled once—  
just once—  
as if adjusting itself on the fly.

And it was over.

No explosion.  
No collapse.  
No spectacle.

The hour simply clicked back into real time.

05:44 → 05:45 → 05:46

Continuity restored.

The block became a block again.  
The air lightened.  
Normal time resumed, indifferent and fragile.

Mara felt the migraine fade.

Something had seen her.  
Something had responded.  
And something had chosen to leave.

# 11. THE LAST MESSAGE

At sunset, Quinn approached her with a tablet.

“There was audio embedded in the last cycle,” he said quietly.  
“You… need to hear it.”

Mara placed the headset on.

A chorus of thousands—layered voices whispering as if from the seams of the world—spoke:

**“We are still here.”**  
**“The hour is not over.”**  
**“Mara Imani… remember us.”**

Then, in a final, chilling harmony:

**“…fifty-seven minutes remain.”**

Mara lowered the headset.

Quinn asked, “What does that mean?”

Mara stared down the street where the loop had once lived.

“It means the conversation isn’t finished.”

And somewhere—  
in some layer of reality—  
the next anomaly was opening its eyes.

1pb6diu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pb6diu,HONEST REVIEW OF EL UNION'S HORCHATA & GRILLED CHEESE (Cafe Suggestion in La Union),"For context, Horchata and Grilled Cheese are two of my all-time favorite cafe orders. Horchata especially is something I always look for on a cafe's menu (even on social media) before deciding to visit. So when I saw this viral combo from El Union, I told myself that the when I visit La Union, I have to try it. 

Here’s my full review:

A. Overall Service

Google Maps says they open at 7 AM, so I arrived around 7:30 to avoid the crowd—big mistake! Maybe because it was a Sunday, but I ended up lining up for almost an hour just to order, plus another 20 minutes to get my food. I already expected it since it’s a well-loved tourist spot. On the bright side, they had fans around the area, so ventilation wasn’t too bad. Although the seats are very limited since the area is like a common area for several stalls.

A. Classic Horchata – ₱180

I ordered the Classic Horchata instead of the Dirty Horchata. Considering it’s a touristy location, the price is reasonable. As for the drink itself… it wasn’t bad, but it was definitely underwhelming. I could taste the cinnamon spice, which I liked, but the subtle creaminess which is an essential part of a good Horchata was almost nonexistent. I’ve tried a lot of Horchatas (and even made my own), and unfortunately this one is my least favorite so far. Horchata should have that dulce, cinnamon-forward richness, but this just fell flat.

Rating: 5/10


C. Grilled Cheese – ₱290

This one felt a little pricey compared to other cafes and pastry shops in San Juan.

The moment you line up, you can already smell the butter and cheese grilling, AMBANGO! Nagutom ako at the time since I'm there to grab my breakfast. Grilled cheese is one of my comfort foods, so I was really looking forward to this as my breakfast.

But when I finally got it… another underwhelming moment. It was a bit greasy but surprisingly didn’t taste buttery—hard to explain, but the flavor just wasn’t there. It's obviously because of the choice of cheese. Although the bread is well grilled, properly crusty and served hot.

And here’s the deal breaker: even if the cheese and butter are mild, a good dip can save a grilled cheese. I expected a marinara dip, but they only had Sriracha. Sadly, it didn’t complement the sandwich at all. Marinara is the key!

Rating: 5.75/10

D. Overall Thoughts

Both items were honestly just mid—nothing special and definitely not worth lining up for an hour. If you’re in LU, I suggest checking out Masa, Arpo, or Karruba. And even though it’s not a local shop, Bo’s Coffee has a really good revel bar!

P.s., the photo I used is not mine. I don't have a picture of my order na hindi ako kita hahaha. I grabbed that from google.",8,1764573394.0,PHFoodPorn,1,1.0,False

There's a 48"" electric standing desk for $69. The Veken 55"" dropped 43% to $113. Full-size desks with drawers and cable management sitting under $125. Even premium 63"" desks for under $200.

Here's what nobody mentions about standing desk shopping: motor quality and stability matter more than brand name. A wobbly desk at standing height is unusable — your monitor shakes, your coffee spills, video calls look like earthquakes. The good news is budget standing desks have improved dramatically. What cost $400+ three years ago is now $80-120 with comparable stability and quieter motors. The key is checking weight capacity, height range, and whether the frame wobbles at max height.

Went through 18 standing desk listings, removed color duplicates, verified prices and specs. These 17 desks cover every size and budget — from compact 32"" desks for small spaces to massive 63"" workstations. Organized by size and price so nobody buys a desk that doesn't fit their space.

# Helpful Note

**Electric vs Manual:** Electric desks have motors that adjust height with button press — worth it if you switch positions multiple times daily. Manual desks (COMHOMA at $44) require hand-cranking or lever adjustment — fine if you set it once and rarely change.

**Memory Presets Matter:** Memory presets save your preferred heights (sitting, standing, etc.) so you press one button instead of holding until you reach the right height. Most desks have 3-4 presets. Worth prioritizing — you'll use standing mode more if switching is effortless.

**Desktop Size Guide:**

* 32"" wide: Laptop + notepad, minimal setup
* 47""-48"" wide: Single monitor + keyboard + some accessories
* 55"" wide: Dual monitors comfortably, full workstation
* 63"" wide: Triple monitors, streaming setup, battlestation

**Height Range Considerations:** Most desks adjust from \~27"" to \~47"". If you're very tall (6'2""+) or short (under 5'4""), check max/min heights carefully. Standard sitting height is 28-30"", standing is 38-46"" depending on height.

**Weight Capacity:** Budget desks typically handle 70-100 lbs. If running dual monitors, monitor arms, and heavy equipment, check capacity. Most listed here handle typical setups fine.

**Stability at Standing Height:** The wobble test matters. Desks with wider leg bases and crossbars are more stable. T-shaped legs wobble more than rectangular frames. ErGear and HUANUO have good stability reputations.

**Assembly Reality:** Budget standing desks require assembly — typically 30-60 minutes. Most include tools. Not difficult, but plan for it. The desktop is usually heaviest part.

**Splice Board vs Single Piece:** Some desks (Furmax, Claiks) have ""splice boards"" — two pieces that connect. Slightly less sturdy than single-piece desktops but often cheaper. Fine for most use cases.

# Skip These If...

* **Skip the COMHOMA at $44** if you want electric — it's manual adjustment only
* **Skip 32"" desks** if you use external monitors — too narrow for comfortable dual-screen setup
* **Skip mobile desks with wheels** if stability is priority — wheels add slight wobble
* **Skip the FITUEYES converter** if you want clean setup — converters sit on existing desk, adds height
* **Skip the Veken 63""** if space is limited — 63"" needs significant room, measure first
* **Skip budget splice-board desks** if you want premium feel — two-piece tops feel less solid
* **Skip electric desks** if budget is absolute priority — manual options work fine for occasional adjustment
* **Skip all standing desks** if you won't actually stand — be honest with yourself, many people buy and never use standing mode

# Size Recommendations by Use Case

**Laptop Only / Minimal Setup:**

* HUANUO 32"" at $69 — compact, electric, 4 presets

**Single Monitor + Keyboard:**

* ErGear 47"" at $94 — most popular, proven reliability

**Dual Monitor Workstation:**

* Veken 55"" at $113 — 43% off, plenty of space

**Triple Monitor / Battlestation:**

* Veken 63"" at $199 — only option for serious setups

**Walking Pad / Treadmill Desk:**

* COMHOMA at $44 (budget) or Veken 55"" at $113 (premium)

**Existing Desk Conversion:**

* FITUEYES at $111 — sits on current desk, no replacement

**Small Apartment:**

* KLSMYHOKI at $56 — mobile, compact, stores easily

The standing desk market has matured significantly and budget options are genuinely good now. The motor technology that made premium desks smooth and quiet has trickled down to the $70-100 range. You no longer need to spend $300+ for a reliable sit-stand desk — the difference is mostly in materials and brand name, not functionality.

The standout deal is the **Veken 55"" at $113** — 43% off, 4.7 stars, 3K+ bought this month, and large enough for dual monitors with room to spare. If your space can handle 55"", this is the value play. The **ErGear at $94** is the safe choice if you want proven reliability — 10K+ bought this month and 9K+ reviews means the kinks are worked out.

For compact spaces, the **HUANUO 32"" at $69** puts electric adjustment in a small footprint. For budget-conscious buyers, the **Furmax 48"" at $69** gives you full-size electric desk at compact desk pricing — arguably the best pure value if you have space.

If storage matters, the **HUANUO 48"" with Drawers at $123** is unique — built-in drawers are rare on standing desks, and C-clamp compatibility means monitor arms mount cleanly. That's 38% off for genuinely useful features.

The honest truth about standing desks: most people use standing mode less than they expect. The desks that get used most have effortless adjustment (electric with memory presets) and enough space to work comfortably. A cramped desk or manual adjustment creates friction that kills the habit. Invest in size and convenience over brand name.

Don't overthink it. Measure your space, pick the appropriate size tier, grab something with memory presets and good reviews. These Cyber Monday prices are yearly lows and standing desks are heavy — shipping deals this good won't last.

Let the Mariah Carey and ~~Plum Cake~~ Gajjar ka halwa take-over begin.

Looking for something more than just small talk and surface-level connections, I seek depth and I seek substance. Something long term that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Consciously seeking kindred spirits. Perhaps even my forever and always. But hey, even that kind of solid connection is best founded on the grounds of *pakka* friendship, don't you think? Forever is a long time, might as-well spend it with your best friend for life.

I just want someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with gingerbread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A Christmas movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

And hey… if we find ourselves standing under the same mistletoe, I won’t blame the universe for giving us a little nudge.

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

1pb66oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1pb66oy/gargling/,Gargling,"

A velvet-colored strain in my footing on the truck bed bites down into the bones of my knees.
Begging for what I don’t have, I glare at the back of this human-colored crustacean at the edge of the bed.
A stone universe. The sound of iron lumps colliding, grinding against each other at the limit.
A man in a helmet watching from a little way off spits out, “That’s the kind of mistake poor bastards make.”

Drumming only the corner of a cheap table with my finger, I talk about things where only the outer moat ever gets filled.
I bow toward the hole worn in my memory by alcohol.
Saying you need a script to apologize for what you don’t remember, I want you to leave a page of it right there on the table’s edge.

The sun stabs down; an older woman opens a parasol.
The edge of the umbrella stabs my eye, and the feel of the bed I was taken to—
even when I try to recall that morning I was asked how it was, the shape of it won’t come back.
In the end, I think she went on and on about her own life, but that’s already melted away.
Only the gargling medicine tasted good, and I used to wash my throat with it a lot.

Since then, whenever I see a face complaining that something bad happened, that it’s unfair,
I recommend gargling. “Rinse it real good. Your throat alone isn’t enough.”
But I always swallow down my own share, and the inherited malfunction quietly rusts the inside of my chest.

Back then I was a delinquent, slugging people away, answering “I don’t like it” the second something displeased me,
and the guy who used to roll his Kawasaki with no helmet on
now dilutes each day with cheap booze, slowly soaking his room’s wallpaper with video ads and e-cigarette smoke.

“Those were the days,” he says, grinning with no front teeth.
With that same mouth he grumbles that there’s not a single fun thing left now.
When I ask what he was eating when his front teeth broke, he says, “Pizza crust.”
“I thought there was a pebble in it, called the part-timer over, and it turned out to be my own tooth,” he goes on.
When I tell him, “Don’t lecture them over something like that,” he puffs out his chest and says, “These teeth cost more than the pizza.”

I laugh, “Ahaha,” and he growls, “Don’t laugh. Want me to knock your front teeth out too?”
The way he says it is so funny I almost laugh again.
“Do it, break them, loser,” I shoot back, and instead of a gentlemanly fistfight we talk it out in something primitive.
From the back of the bar, a staff member glances over once, then drops their eyes to the floor.
Wiping nosebleed from the back of my hand, I dribble out the excuse that youth never ends, no matter how old you get.

When I’m sprawled on the ground, the taste of asphalt is like the bitterness of strong Hawaiian coffee,
and as I notice that, I briefly wonder if it changes with the seasons. That doesn’t matter either.
By the time I lift my head, I’m already staring at my room’s ceiling.
The angle of the room’s circulator is wrong; the air doesn’t move.
The stagnant air keeps hanging there, and only my own particles slowly seep out into the space,
and at night I start waking up over and over in the middle of the same dream.
Whether that’s because of the season or not, I don’t even have the energy to find out.

There are only things gargling can’t do a thing about.
“It’s precisely because nothing can be done that it never gets solved,” said the guy at the same island of desks, lining up resignation like maxims.
In the middle of work, he threw up, left a single round stain in the hall, and never came back.
I’m sure it wasn’t just that he didn’t gargle enough.

The water in the pristine office cooler has even less taste than that gargling medicine.
At the bottom of the paper cup, a ring of water remains, like that round stain from before.
Beside it, only the filth has been left behind.
Now and then someone’s curses ring out, and the phones keep ringing and ringing and ringing.
A white, sharp-edged staircase stretches from the first to the third floor—steps like the table corner stretched straight up—
and from the top I was cutting off people’s heads, rolling them down for fun.

Back then I was in the slave-trading business.
Stamping contracts with my own name, dipping my fingertips into the ink pad, staining them a red like nosebleed,
every morning I declared in the same voice, “Let’s make dreams come true,” “Let’s change the world,”
buying good-looking young men and women cheap and selling them dear to rich clients in the provinces.
Back then only my wallet kept getting fatter; I still didn’t know how to gargle.

When the road bent, the Kawasaki stopped breathing on the street, and only the trees above it swayed,
the air turned over from the inside,
and I saw an outrageously clumsy penguin chick, walking while tripping,
and realized that the time inside me was still sitting there in the posture of my teenage years.

The teacher who told me, “You’ll never amount to any kind of decent adult.”
From the time I shot back, “I hear your son doesn’t leave the house. Hey, sir. Just because he’s not someone else’s kid, huh?”
nothing has changed. His voice hangs in the back of my ears, at exactly the same pitch as back then, like a bell.

【Explanation Poem】

The strain that bites into the bones of his knees on the truck bed and the round stain left in the hallway are both things left behind after the destination of force has been changed.
In one case, no matter how he braces himself, nothing pays off; in the other, only what he spat out remains as evidence.
Moving back and forth between those two, the narrator turns other people’s teeth, heads and dreams into funny stories while only washing his own throat.
When the fingers that stamp slave-trading contracts take on the same red as nosebleed, the direction that force is moving in clearly changes.
The hand that used to be on the side of hitting becomes a hand that signs its name on paper, yet the ones being sold are always young bodies.
The words recommending gargling sound kind, but in practice they function as a ritual for protecting silence.
What really ought to be rinsed away may be not the throat but the stain in the hall and the traces of the contracts on the paper.
The moment he tries to ask that, the narrator always twists himself back toward jokes and old stories.
The front teeth broken on pizza and the nosebleed relabeled as youth are quietly rearranged as prices that have already been paid.
With no one stopping any of it on the spot, the days go on, the water is refilled, and the bells keep ringing.
Even so, only the penguin chick and the pitch of the teacher’s voice go on watching from the edge of the world.
They judge nothing and merely watch, but the bare fact of being watched is what hits later.
If the round stain comes back to mind every time he washes his throat, that means he still hasn’t entirely thrown away the space that remains for something else.
Just when he almost admits that, he turns it into a joke and clutches only the glass of water.
The posture of deciding neither to wash nor to throw away is the only thing that remains for a long time outside the scene.

I’ve always been super shy, never had real friends, never dated, never kissed anyone, and during the pandemic I developed OCD about cleaning myself and personal belongings, and I also developed social anxiety. After finishing high school, my mental health got so fucked up that I barely left my house for an entire year except for therapy or doctor appointments. My new therapist suggested I try Tinder to meet new people online, since I never had any social life outside school.

On Tinder, I matched with William, a 33-year-old pansexual guy who gave me a super like. I opened up to him in a way I never had with anyone before, even telling him about my mental health. He was super understanding, and things got serious really fast — in one week, we were already calling each other “love,” had a monogamous arrangement, and he even said that ""he was my man and would protect me.”

We planned a date at the mall and the movies, but my overprotective parents freaked out about the age gap and how fast everything was moving, thinking that he'd kidnap me or something like that. William got upset that they thought he’d hurt me, and ended up distancing himself away from me, but later everything worked out. He even offered to drive two hours to see me. After huge discussions with my parents, they finally let me go to the date.

William and I agreed not to rush anything or do anything sexual because everything was new to me. On the day, he arrived two and a half hours late, but I didn’t mind because he was the one travelling barely two hours just for our date. We got coffee, walked around, talked, and later went to watch a Disney movie. I was only able to open myself to him through our time together, since everything was new and strange to me. In the elevator, he hugged me and kissed my hair — it was literally the first time I ever felt sexual attraction to someone, and it scared me to death. In the movie, we held hands and cuddled; he gave me a few small kisses, but I didn’t want my first real kiss to be in a crowded theater filled with kids and annoying teenagers who couldn't shut up for a second. When we said goodbye, I gave him only a few pecks because I was scared of not being good enough due to his experience.

On the Uber ride home, I was blushing and giggling to myself nonstop. It had been my first kiss, first date, first “boyfriend”… the most romantic and special moment of my whole life. But when I messaged him how special the night was to me and apologized for being awkward, he said the problem wasn’t awkwardness — it was that I supposedly lacked “desire.” He said I acted like I didn’t like him or the date. I tried reassuring him, but he didn’t believe me and wouldn’t even say if he liked the date.

Since then, I’ve been apologizing constantly, but he told me we have no future because of my controlling parents, because I didn’t french kiss him, and because he didn’t like how “slow” our date was — even though he said he’d respect my boundaries. He said he wanted to make out in the theater, but I didn't look like I was enjoying him, even though I was literally cuddling and being all lovey dovery with him?!! After that, we stopped talking.

I don’t know what to do. Am I being too sensitive or too slow for not french kissing him on my first date ever? I feel like I gave my all — I couldn’t sleep the night before, shaved because he liked “younger boys without hair,” waited for him for a long time, tried my best to show him affection despite my lack of experience and psychological problems, apologized for everything… but I still feel like I’m not enough.

I can sense his annoyance.. and something else. I am being cruel. But he said to me ""find someone else, or adjust your expectations"". Am I maliciously compliant? A wife should be docile and compliant, yes?

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

Traffic that somehow affected only them and no other human being on the road.

It hit me when I got irrationaly annoyed that the bus driver did not stop at the exact tile where I always stand. My brain went wait, you are breaking the system. There is no system. I just made it up.



Some examples. If I start a book on a Monday, I feel like I have to finish it before the next Monday or it will become a ""lost book"" and I will never touch it again. I have a rule that the first sip of coffee has to be in complete silence or the day feels cursed, so I will literally pause a podcast just to take that dramatic first sip. When I walk on the sidewalk at night, I silently pick one stranger and decide we are on a mission together to get home safely, so I keep pace with them. They have no idea they are part of my weird co op game.



None of these rules are serious, but they do kind of shape my days. Sometimes they make things more fun, sometimes they make me stress about very dumb stuff. I am trying to decide which ones to keep and which ones to gently retire.

He says he doesn't mean to fall asleep but sometimes he's fully in bed under to covers telling me he didn't mean to go to sleep.

I have approached him about this, asked him if he could just let me know if he's going to sleep, told him how frustrated and lonely it makes me feel. Ive asked him if theres something going on, if theres some deeper reason, he's not telling me he's depressed or giving me any reason I can understand for why he's sleeping all the time. He just says he doesn't mean to fall asleep.

The last two weekends he's spent all day in bed. He sleeps/stays up on his laptop on the sofa overnight because he snores (there is another bedroom but he always just sleeps on the sofa).

*   **Learning new software:** I'm finally tackling that data analytics course I've been putting off. Turns out, understanding the data *behind* the AI is kind of crucial.
*   **Boosting creativity:** AI is good at *generating* things, but it still (mostly) sucks at coming up with truly original ideas. Sharpening those creative muscles feels like a solid defense.
*   **Deepening human connection:** This is the big one. The more we can build genuine relationships and provide empathy (something AI can't *really* do), the more valuable we become.

I stumbled across this program, *Automate It Pro* (full disclosure, found it through [https://whop.com/automateit/automateitpro?a=liveitupdeals](https://whop.com/automateit/automateitpro?a=liveitupdeals)), that's actually helping me automate some of the super repetitive stuff at work so I can *focus* on the more strategic, creative work. It's been a game changer in terms of feeling like I'm at least *trying* to stay ahead of the curve.

It's not just about keeping our jobs, though, is it? It's about staying relevant, staying curious, and not letting technology completely overwhelm us. Are we going to become obsolete? Or are we going to evolve alongside the machines?

It's a weird, scary, and kinda exciting time to be alive. What do you guys think? Are you feeling the pressure to upskill, or am I just having a mid-life crisis disguised as AI anxiety? Just wondering where everyone's head is at…",1,1764571432.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Also, it's probably not but I feel like this is easily doxxable so if you know me... no you don't

Anyways, here's the stats and ECs (slightly higher numbers than when I applied bc of continued activities):

21 ORM, NC resident

Currently attend UNC, 3.77 GPA/3.66 sGPA, cGPA should be 3.8 after this semester and hopefully 3.81 when I graduate

507 MCAT (130/125/124/128) this is definitely my largest red flag. I hate it bc it doesn't reflect my practice scores at all but it is what it is... planning on a retake but haven't registered yet and I'd rather kms (not actually but it sure feels like that)

ECs (next semester hours are in parentheses):

250 hrs clinical, medical assistant

240 hrs clinical, patient safety observer (+120)

160 hrs clinical(?), childrens hospital volunteering w/ patient interactions (+30)

60 hrs shadowing

800 hrs research, small poster presentation and just finished my honors thesis (+150)

90 hrs volunteering, do science experiments w/ underserved kids, have some leadership (+30)

120 hrs volunteering, music lessons w/ underserved kids (+30)

210 hrs TA for upper level science courses (+70)

150 hrs leadership, co-director of graphics for a large hackathon. This was just for fun though because I like to draw and have CS friends

200 hrs as a coffee shop barista my freshman year

3600 hrs of playing an instrument (+100)

0 hrs hobby, the hobby I put down was making music covers of songs on my instrument (anime OPs but I didn't write that obviously) bc I thought that was the most unique + gave me the most to talk about. Other hobbies that I didn't put down but could instead are reading, crochet, and drawing

School list:

I applied to all of my state schools (except the really good ones, Duke or Stanford type schools), one public school that I'm considered OOS for but still have strong ties to (they have specific ""ties"" criteria that I don't meet), and a few private schools where I met the 10th percentile for MCAT score. Total, this was about 10 schools, which I know was way too low but at this point I had just received my MCAT score and was hella depressed, figured I wasn't going to get in anyways, and applied to few schools as a hail mary.

Currently have 1 pre-II hold from Tulane, essentially 1 R. Most of the schools I applied to mass-reject in jan/march according to cycletrack so yeah, I think the radio silence means I'm screwed :(

Anyways, things I should consider for next year? I feel like overall my hours are ok, and they are all stuff I am passionate about (hoping to go into peds if you couldn't tell). For my gap year, I hope to get a clinical research position and more volunteering (if I can find a place). I am also definitely applying to more schools. And someone please slap me in the face and tell me to get over the MCAT thing and just start studying for it already",3,1764571390.0,premed,7,0.81,False

1pb5rpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/1pb5rpz/thoughts_and_questions_from_a_tourist/,Thoughts And Questions From A Tourist,"Hello everyone, last week I visited Saudi Arabia for the first time ever! I did a few touristy things such as going to KAFD, Kingdom Tower, Abaya Mall, and trying local food spots & coffee shops. I am lucky because I had a Saudi acquaintance from university who offered to be my tour guide & translator in the city. However, this acquaintance has been living in the US for a long time and was unable to help me navigate cultural differences very well, so I feel that I may have misinterpreted aspects of the culture.

Overall, I liked my trip, much of it reminded me of my own home countries (US and Mexico). However, I have some questions I'd like to ask (paired with my experiences as a reference) in order to understand the culture better and in order for me to manage expectations for the next time I visit (Inshallah I will do Umrah next December).

In Mexico we always greet the workers and begin conversation while browsing, and in the US we typically greet and go straight into asking for help. At the Abaya Mall, when we walked into stores I noticed it was a 50/50 chance that we would be acknowledged until we reached out for help. Is this typical? Can you please let me know what the normal protocol would be so I know what to expect and how to respond?

Also, I am a girl, and in the US it is very common to jump into conversation with other girls over small things and even befriend them quickly. Mexicans are a bit more reserved but we are always very friendly and will make polite conversation. However in KSA, I felt that there was a lot of restraint amongst the women. For example bathrooms & prayer rooms were very quiet which is a huge difference from the West where the ladies gather to converse and become friends, and it was a huge surprise to me just how quiet populated areas can be with so many low voices.

Another thing is that I noticed girls would stare at me or watch me as I walk by. I assume it's because I am an obvious foreigner walking around in abaya and hijab, or maybe because I was wearing something wrong (please let me know some common mistakes!) but this made me wonder: how do girls become friends here? Will two strangers go up to each other and converse? I wanted to talk to many girls to ask where their abayas or jewelry were from, but I was scared to come off as rude or invasive.

Again, I hope I am not coming off as mean or rude. There are so many aspects of Khaleeji culture that I love and admire, and I ask these questions so that I can be a better visitor, because I believe it comes from understanding first. Thank you all!",1,1764571202.0,saudiarabia,2,1.0,False

Was browsing FB marketplace last night and came across a Breville Dual Boiler + Breville Smart Grinder Pro + a Breville Knock Box.

Initially, the seller had it listed for $150, but then upped it to $250 after, presumably, receiving lots of interest.

Biggest hesitation is that the seller doesn't know how this works. They said it makes coffee - and that's all they left it at. They mentioned that their neighbor sold it to them, and that they found learning it to be too time consuming.

She wants to meet in public, so won't have a chance to properly test it out. I asked for the serial number and it looks like it's a 2015 model - so 10 years old.

At $150, I was willing to take the gamble. At $250, what do you think? There's no info on maintaince, on the type of water used, frequency of use, etc.

I must admit that I **completely forgot to announce the mod** when I had finished it **back in October** (almost 2 full months ago). But *self-advertisement* must continue!

*^((I also just genuinely adore this game, so I'm happy to draw attention to it.))*

# Kholo Ancestry

**Heritages.** All 7 heritages are available, several of which have appropriate changes.

**Ancestry Feats.** This mod includes all 18 of the ancestry feats from levels 1 to 9.

**Familiars.** With the inclusion of ""combat familiars"" (non-creature tokens on your portrait, which provide helpful effects to the master, similar in function to the NPC Familiars in NPC Core) in an base game update that occurred after the mod's initial release, it also adds the ""Scent"" familiar ability to the game, which is **always prepared** (and counts against your limit) if you take the Hyena Familiar feat. There is also a hyena-shaped familiar token option provided, courtesy of Flaticon (it's the one in the mod page preview).

**Weapon****~~s~~****.** The [Spirit Thresher](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=478) has also been added, with weapon art by [ABloomsday](https://x.com/abloomsdayy/).

**Lots of changes.** There is a heavy reliance on the [Exploration Activities](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3527574947) mod (in addition to lighter reliance on a few others) to produce effects that are mechanically meaningful and varied across heritages and feats. A number of feats required specific changes, such as replacing non-existent roleplay spells with stronger, more competitive options. A more detailed breakdown of specific changes can be found on the mod page!

There is also a Dawnsbury Days campaign easter egg with the Imprecise Scent feat.

A mod so good, I have **more current subscribers** than **actual views** on the mod page! Happy gnawing!

**TL;DR:**  
[Journiv](https://journiv.com/) is a a beautiful, self-hosted, privacy-first journaling app with mood tracking, daily prompts, and meaningful insights. The mission is simple: **your memories should always stay yours.** Own them, don’t rent them.

Journiv 0.1.0-beta.8 is now live on [GitHub](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app) and fully [Docker-hostable](https://journiv.com/docs/installation).  
Start owning your thoughts and memories forever and keep them completely private.

**The Story Behind Journiv**

I got into self-hosting last year and like many here, while exploring options journaling solution, I realized there wasn’t a truly modern, self-hosted equivalent to Day One or Apple Journal. Most alternatives were either general note apps or old abandoned projects.

I wanted something focused on journaling with:

* “On This Day” memories
* Prompt-based journaling
* A clean, minimal, distraction-free writing experience
* Open format

So… I built my own: [Journiv](https://journiv.com/), a beautiful (at least I am trying to make it so), self-hosted, privacy-first journaling app with mood tracking, daily prompts, and meaningful insights. Journiv began as a deeply personal project, a way for me to capture memories, reflections, and the stories behind thousands of photos and videos of my fast-growing kids. What started as a tool for my own parenting journey has grown into something that fills a real gap in the self-hosting community.

If you’re curious, you can read the full story behind Journiv [here](https://journiv.com/blog/the-story-behind-journiv).

**Get Involved**

Give Journiv a try, share your feedback and report [issues](https://github.com/journiv/journiv-app/issues). It means a lot at this stage.

**The Journey Ahead**

Journiv is in active development, with a fully functional backend, a web frontend, and mobile apps launching soon. It is self-hosted, and designed to be your companion for decades.

Journiv is being built because our memories deserve to be ours, forever.

**Question for the community**

Journiv was requested to be made available on Unraid (available now), Yunohost, PikaPods etc. I wanted to check if people here would like to see Journiv on CasaOS App store to directly deploy it rather than through docker. Since I am a solo developer working on this as side project I want to only do this if there is interest for it in CasaOS community.

At this level, it will be difficult to avoid public criticism ahead of next November's midterm elections. President Trump has announced a ""course correction"" of re-ciprocal tariffs, citing rising prices.","December 2, 2025

At this level, it will be difficult to avoid public criticism ahead of next November's midterm elections. President Trump has announced a ""course correction"" of re-ciprocal tariffs, citing rising prices.



I believe these exclusions are not about ""reciprocal tariffs,"" but rather about the ""farm labor shortage"" caused by the arrest and deportation of illegal immi-grants.



Tariff exclusions include oranges, grapefruit, coffee, tea, bananas, tomatoes, and beef. This is closely related to the ""problem of illegal immigration.""



Ripe oranges were ripening in California's orange groves. When I visited on January 29, there were no ""workers"" there, and the oranges were left unhar-vested.



The United States once asked Japan to liberalize the grapefruit trade. In 1971, Japanese mandarin orange farmers suffered a major blow. At the time, the United States was an exporter.



According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, illegal immigrants account for more than 40% of the U.S. agricultural workforce. If these arrests continue, agriculture will face a labor shortage and suffer enormous economic losses.



I believe this is because the shortage of agricultural workers caused by the mass arrests of illegal immigrants has led to increased agricultural imports, which are being affected by reciprocal tariffs.



The Trump administration should address the immigration issue rather than re-ciprocal tariffs. The American economy is supported by illegal immigrants. The Trump administration should utilize illegal immigrants to restore a strong Amer-ica.



The United States conducts international trade based on the principle of com-parative advantage proposed by 19th-century economist Ricardo. I believe that policies to compensate for this drawback are necessary.



The principle of comparative advantage states that each country specializes in the production of goods that are relatively more productively efficient than oth-er countries, and both countries benefit from trading those goods.



Americans value high-value-added labor. They dislike low-value-added labor in agriculture and manufacturing. This is the current state of the American econ-omy. Policies to compensate for this are needed.



To revitalize the unpopular agriculture and manufacturing industries based on the principle of comparative advantage, the United States should utilize illegal immigrants as workers in ""poor working conditions"" and ""low-wage labor.""



I have repeatedly proposed accepting illegal immigrants flocking to the Mexican border into a ""special zone"" as ""temporary immigrants"" and employing them as low-wage workers.



If ""temporary immigrants"" were employed in factories in the ""special zone"" as unskilled assembly workers or other jobs that Americans dislike, iPhone assem-bly could be produced within the United States.



If they were trained as shipbuilders in shipyards in the ""special zone"" under harsh working conditions that Americans dislike and employed for low wages, it would lead to the ""revival"" of the shipbuilding industry.



Immigrants working in the ""special zone"" can obtain work visas if they meet certain requirements, such as English proficiency. They can leave the ""special zone"" and work as regular employees throughout the United States.



Obtaining a work visa would also enable them to work on farms, etc. Americans should be a little more patient while illegal immigrants obtain legal work visas.
