From further inspection they clearly somehow spawned in the coffee cup.

Now I never get flies or any insects in my room because I live on a very high floor, so I tried to get rid of them with some advice I found on Google. It killed some but not all of them. So how could I potentially get rid of these flies and what on earth are they? As now I can’t even leave food out on the table just incase.😭",1,1736791818.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False

**Summer, 29,011**

**Groundskeeper Alatan**

-

“Thank you for meeting with me, Altalan. I know you have been busy as of late, and I appreciate it that you have taken some of that time to look at what might appear to be a lesser issue that has been festering in the academy gardens,” I said in greeting.

“Indeed, things have been slow as of late, and the next school year roster has proven to be rather uneventful. Of course, it would be appreciated if you would maintain *some* level of decorum, *Groundskeeper* Alatan. That you are no longer a player in the game is no excuse for allowing one’s appearances to suffer,” replied Dean Altalan Rur Astur with hints of fuchsia sea salt wafts in his voice.

“I reckon appearances won’t matter here, or perhaps you don’t trust the inquisitors to not get our names confused?” I asked in jest.

Dean Astur turned to face me, maintaining a stoic scowl. It would seem the old goat had still yet to develop a sense of humour.

“As you please, Dean Astur. If you would follow me, I will bring you to one of the more depleted places. It should be easier to perceive the issue there,” I said, beckoning the Dean to follow.

We turned left into what the unassuming eye might have considered a flowerbed, and it parted to reveal a white pebbled pathway that greeted by the blossoming arrangement of song flowers that unfurled and sang in the presence of our mana fields. Each petal had been meticulously tuned for a different role, with the baritones proving to be my favourites. Their deeper pitches laced with citrus notes and wafts of orange reverberated within my ears. I allowed myself to take in the experience as I followed the mana stream that guided me even as the path closed off behind us.

Hints of the abnormality began to manifest in subtle ways on our approach. Mana streams tugged at by the near-still current. Fraying in the fragile threads of spell work. Flowers drawn ever so slightly out of tune. Yet even so, I could feel nothing tug against my mana field. That absence of cause unsettled me greatly, and while Astur wore his stoic mask on his face and mana field well, I suspected it bothered him too.

At the end of our pleasant stroll we came upon a clearing that proved to be the destination of this phantom current. The dead zone, though dead was perhaps overstating it somewhat. The mana density was only faintly lower than its surroundings and to an untrained observer one might not suspect that anything was amiss. Yet all the same, there were hints visible even to the most mana deficient of commoners. Snow blossoms that were sensitive to the richness of mana to mature refused to blossom. Glimmervines slithered away from the center. Riftcaps, resilient to fluctuating mana as they were, had sprung up between the flower beds, though strangely they grew haphazardly rather in the ring patterns that often cropped up in places where the veil between worlds were naturally weakened. Even the spell forms that spread His Eternal Majesty’s nurturing light across the gardens had notably deteriorated. It was as strange as it was concerning.

“How long has this *blight* been festering?” Asked the Dean in a direct and tart shade of orange.

“I first noticed this patch ten years ago. Fourteen others have manifested since then. The dip fainter to the point of feeling illusory then and has become more prominent since. I only brought this to your attention just now ‘cause I wanted to be sure it wasn’t just my imagination and was looking for other causes first. My first guess was some sort of manavore, like in the death swamps. Soulsponge moss infestations aren’t too uncommon and have been known to rend entire regions as decrepit as some of the adjacent realms. Ruled that out when none of my wither spells stopped the expansion. Taints a bust too; no signs of consumption anywhere. Thought it might have been some student prank gone astray, but there are no signs of spellforms. That line of reasoning also rules out any other sanctioned spells, though unsanctioned or untamed magic is still possible. Unlikely, but possible. The riftcaps suggested the magic could be draining somewhere. I tried a few scrying spells but saw neither dimensional pocket nor even the faintest hints of lesser magic one would expect of an adjacent realm. It shames me to admit, but I’m at a complete loss as to the cause,” I said as I scratched my beard.

“Indeed, that much is apparent,” said the Dean in pensive shades of turquoise-orange.

Dean Astur closed his eyes in contemplation, then after a moment he went to work. Without so much as a murmur or gesture, he cast an eclectic cocktail of spells in parallel, most I recognized, some I could infer, and one I had never seen before. The Dean paused after the latter spell for a moment before finally casting a dimensional scrying spell. An iridescent light rippled throughout the dead zone to slip through any cracks in space to return to us a vision from the other side. Or rather, it would if there had *been* another side to report. Much like my own attempts, the spellform simply *failed*, returning illusionary nullspace in absentia of a vision.

“This is quite the curious mystery you have brought to my attention, groundskeeper. I’ll be sure to lend you the aid of any apprentices or upper years-men you require to solve this issue,” said Dean Astur to the scent of violet.

I was taken aback by the Dean’s nonchalant attitude.

“Apprentices? Dean Astur, given the circumstances, would it not be prudent to request an official investigation?” I asked.

“You would propose I summon a crown investigation led by black robes on a minor matter such as this?” Asked the Dean in violet-magenta flavoured tones.

“Honourable Dean, this may have the appearances of something small and containable, but I know from experience that matters such as this tend to worsen gradually, then all at once. Much like weeds need to be pulled out before their roots have time to deepen, so too does this blight need to be dealt with to prevent catastrophe,” I complained.

“Pray tell Alatan, suppose I were to heed your suggestion and at the end of it, the black robes were to discover that the cause of these dead-zones was caused by a persistent spell that a negligent lower-year student forgot to end? Or perhaps they discover that these are merely emergent holes that manifest in the presence of interfering light magic, akin to the freak waves and holes that terrorize *common* sailors? Would you have me put the weight of my name and position to advise the high council on the perils of mass draining events before ruling out such trivialities?” Asked the Dean, his words laced with the greenish—purple hues of amused contempt.

“I appreciate your reputation is important in this matter, but can we truly rule out such a possibility?” I asked.

“And where, pray tell, would it drain to? Did you see a realm where I did not?” Asked the Dean, the hue of his words unchanged. It annoyed me that Astur insisted on his indirect way of not answering questions. It made it harder for me to use my gift to read him, though perhaps that was the point. Nobody with any sense spoke with directness to a crown inquisitor. Even a disgraced one.

“I… yes, I suppose I didn’t. Even the most mana deficient of realms or the masterful of light magic wielders would have returned *something* from a high-tier scrying spell,” I conceded.

“Then we have an understanding. I’ll ensure you have access to whatever aids you require, and I expect you will keep me updated should this… blight… progress further or manifest new developments. Though I suspect this issue should resolve itself over the next ten years, or at the very least, we will have answers then,” stated Dean Astur, his words filled with a fruity yellow-green confidence.

“As you please,” I said, allowing a hint of pink frustration to leave my lips, “I hope for all our sakes your optimism is well founded.”

And with that we left the desecrated space, continuing our tranquil stroll through the gardens and shifting our conversation to how the dragon lilies in his grand daughter’s garden were coming along. It seemed the young lass was quite the green thumb.

**July 2039**

**Director Laura Weir**

-

My coffee began to reheat itself as I sat forward in my office’s executive seat, gazing at my screen with split attentiveness as I listened in on Emma Booker’s therapy session. I had my microphone at the ready in case I needed to direct the therapist, but for the moment that wasn’t necessary as Ran Booker had insisted on being present for the time being. She was one of the main reasons I was acting remotely, with the other being the therapist’s own advice on keeping distance so she could maintain trust and the illusion of privacy. In any case, nothing confidential or relevant to Emma’s candidacy was expected to come up yet, so for the time being I was merely an observer.

Of course, I hated sitting idly. People like me rarely did, and while I logically knew that guiding young Booker was of critical importance for humanity I felt as though I would go insane if I didn’t do *something* to keep my mind busy and feeling productive. Eventually I settled on sifting through various low-priority alerts and catching up on mail. My EVI thankfully prompted me to look into some happenings at our exoreality facility, and after setting things up to ensure no cross-feed, I hopped into a call with one of onsite engineers managing the place.

“Hi Trevor, it’s Director Laura Weir speaking. I was doing some bookkeeping, and I noticed you had some unusual activity, so I wanted to do a quick check in to make sure things were running smoothly,” I began, minimizing unnecessary pleasantries and jumping straight to the point.

“Ah, Director, I appreciate your concern. Yes, there was an incident Tuesday morning in siphoning station 1. Radiation levels momentarily spiked up to just about 1500% that of nominal levels measured on the other side. Thankfully there were no breaches, though the inner tank has notable deterioration, and the emergency shut-off system was triggered. We are presently doing a maintenance inspection to verify integrity, and repairs are being planned as we speak. Our guys think there was some kind of virtual exoparticle surge on the other side, though it must have been an extremely localized event since the other siphons appear to be running optimally. Did you want to inspect things yourself?” Reported Trevor.

“No, I don’t believe that will be necessary. You seem to have the situation handled, and I trust you to inform the appropriate channels should something unexpected crop up no matter how trivial it may seem. Good work,” I replied. 

“Oh, there was one other thing. The portal people sent us another message today. It appears to be asking how our, and I quote, *’portal training’* is coming along. Expect a full report from ex-com before the day is over,” said Trevor.

I furrowed my brow.

“Portal… *training?* What on Earth is that supposed to mean? Are they expecting us to train the portal algorithm using *neural networks?* There must be more to the message,” I reacted in bafflement.

“Just the usual excessive padding, I’m afraid. We’ve tried cross-referencing it with our other communications for further context, but so far, the best we’ve got is maybe they are expecting us to practice our arrival speeches,” replied Trevor.

“Then why didn’t they just say *that* then!?” I shouted, then paused. Getting overworked over some obtuse portal people would solve nothing. I took a moment to calm down before continuing, “I’m sure there is some logical explanation for their choice of wording. Regardless, we can’t reply back until the end of the month, so we have until then to figure this out. In the meantime, I have other matters that call for me, so I have to go. Keep up the good work.”

I ended the call, leaving only the feed of the other session I was observing, and rubbed my forehead in frustration. The portal people had been nothing but cryptic, and every attempt at understanding them only raised more questions. On the one hand, there was some merit to their claims of being an enlightened, advanced society. They had some means of travelling and communicating between dimensions, and their language appeared nuanced and well-structured. On the other hand, they appeared to have some archaic, almost primitive ways of doing things. Their titles resembled that of a feudal society, their language was written in parchment and lacked words for various technological advancements and concepts, and they tended to explain away natural concepts with ‘gods’ and ‘magic’ like many religions did prior to the advent of science.

The trans-dimensional transceivers we periodically received only added to the confusion. At first, we assumed that the lack of schematics provided for these physics-defying crystals was part of the test; but my views had changed since then. The lattice matrix for the crystals, when viewed in a microscope and simulated in a supercomputer demonstrated that their structure was horribly inefficient for their intended purpose, so much so that if their society was anywhere near as advanced as ours, they would have noticed the discrepancy and would have seeded them more efficiently. That suggested the crystals were natural rather than artificial, and I half expected the portal people might just be dangling them as wind chimes like cartoon cavemen and speaking into them like primitive phones, dependant on the natural radiation levels to do the heavy lifting for them. At this point I was starting to believe this society was living in some post-apocalyptic wasteland produced by the source of this radiation, which would explain the gaps in their knowledge. Perhaps they made their portals by tying a glowing rock or tied some scavenged Clark-tech to a stick and waving it around. That would certainly explain their need for ‘training’.

The first candidate was supposed to provide answers, but even then, our efforts were frustrated. The black box returned with the candidate’s remains was not entirely unscathed by the local exoradiation, and what it had recorded was less than helpful. Surviving visual recordings revealed some sort of cathedral-like structure filled people that would not be out of place in fantasy folklore adorned in clothing ranging from robes to torn rags. Audio files caught only scattered parts of conversations, and spatial telemetry proved completely compromised. A step up from wasteland tribalism, sure, but not a huge step judging by the complete lack of any visible technology. No signs of radio-communication, no artificial lighting, no switches, no wiring, no computers, nothing. And yet they had to be hiding *something*. They sent our equipment back, after all. If we were to learn anything about this place at all, we needed someone on-site. Our second candidate needed to succeed where her predecessor had failed. I would see to that personally.

Returning my focus to the screen, I watched as Ran Booker finally left the room to leave Emma alone with the therapist. With the door closed, the two of them could finally talk about the incident without having to censor themselves.

“I heard you had quite a day at Six Spires. Would you like to share with me what *really* happened?” Asked the therapist, Dr. Julia West.

“Well, I wanted to be a hero like Ms. Weir said I was. I came up with some cool moves, like my fire vortex and flame twister, and, well, there were monsters. So, I ran in, and, well, at first things went great! But then I started to get tired, and these strange men tried to…” Emma hesitated.

The doctor smiled and tried to console her.

“It’s ok, Emma. Your safe here,” said Dr. West.

“They… they tried to kidnap me! My fire attacks did nothing to them, and then they tased me, and then one of your agents chased them off… except one, and he put a knife to my throat and… oh my gosh, I think… is he…” Emma stammered.

“Tell her he’s alive,” I whispered into my microphone. It was a lie, of course. I wished the man was available for interrogation, but being paralyzed, face-down in water did him no favours. Dr. West didn’t visibly react to my words, aside from putting on a trained smile.

“He’s alive, and in our custody. I’m afraid that is all I am allowed to say on that matter, but rest assured, you did no permanent harm to him,” said Dr. West with neutral compassion.

Emma sighed with relief.

“Oh, thank you, thank you. You don’t know how much of a relief that was. I thought for sure he was dead,” said Emma. She held her hands out in front of her and mouthed a prayer which the lip-reading software identified as one of thanks before she continued, “well, I’m not quite sure what happened, but when he… you know, I couldn’t help but think about what it was like to be… you know. And then *it* happened. I felt… pain… then he let go… then my muscles… my heart… they just stopped, and then my powers stopped too! I couldn’t move! I would have died if my aunt hadn’t saved me. I don’t want to feel like that ever again.”

“You said *it* happened. Would you like to elaborate?” Asked Dr. West.

“No, I… I want to forget. When they… I had a nightmare a few nights ago. Then it happened again! I was in bed! My heart stopped again. In my own bed. I was scared. When I recovered, I had to move Professor Snuggles away from me so I wouldn’t hurt him. I don’t want to hurt my aunt! I don’t want to hurt *anyone*. I don’t… I feel like a monster…” Emma looked down, expressionless. 

This would not do. If Emma was to be our candidate, I needed her to accept her powers and foster them, not fear them like she was doing now. I decided to act, whispering to Dr. West to wrap her arms around Emma and comfort her. West’s eyes briefly widened, thankfully out of sight of Emma, but she proceeded to do as I said by resting her hand on the girl’s shoulder.

“It’s ok, Emma. You are safe here. I believe you won’t hurt me because you don’t want to hurt me. You were acting because you were afraid,” said Dr. West, struggling not to fidget from the danger she was in, “would you like something from the fridge first to help you feel comfortable? Some soda perhaps?”

Emma looked up and took a deep breath through her nose, readying herself.

“No, it’s fine. I’ll, I’ll try. I… I was tased… and when I remembered how… how I… felt… then I… it was the memory of being shocked. I… please, I don’t want to. Not again. I don’t want to hurt anyone or myself. This isn’t what I thought having powers would be like,” said Emma.

“Th-thank you Emma, that’s very brave of you,” said Dr. West. She glared at the hidden camera briefly at that.

“You’ll get your hazard pay. Just steer her towards desensitization and exposure therapy. She has the power; we just need to remap it to a gentler point of reference. Lever her hopes and fears if you have to,” I whispered.

“Many people who experience trauma benefit from something called ‘desensitization’, a treatment where steps are taken to separate the emotion from the memory itself. I believe you would benefit greatly from such a treatment, especially at your age, and we can help map your abilities to a more positive memory,” said Dr. West.

“I don’t know,” Emma said, unconvinced, “I think I would rather just… not think about this. Exposure therapy sounds like picking at a wound, you know?”

“I don’t recommend that course of action, Emma. Trauma can resurface at any time without warning if not treated. Treatment can help you feel confident that you can safely interact with your loved ones, like your aunt. Or Mr. Snuggles…” began Dr. West.

“Professor Snuggles!” Emma blurted, then she went flustered, “no, no I don’t want to hurt anyone, but are you really sure this is the only way?”

“When you were creating your… fire vortex… how did you feel? Were you worried about hurting people? Or was it something else? Joy perhaps?” Began Dr. West.

“Yeah, but that’s different, isn’t it?” Asked Emma.

“I don’t think so. I think we can help you feel the same way with your new ability. Electricity, is it? We can help you feel that way again. Feel like you can be you again. Feel like you can have fun and not hurt anyone,” said the doctor.

“Well…” Emma hesitated, “well, ok. I’ll… I’ll give it a shot.”

They continued talking, but all I could do is smile. Things were going great, and once I unlocked the secrets of Emma’s cells, we would be able to awaken her powers in a safe and controlled manner. And once that was accomplished, I could finally taste the fruits of the tree of scientific inquiry.

I would see to that personally too.",1,1736791817.0,JCBWritingCorner,0,1.0,False

It's crazy to me!  
The tool helps to automatically rename your Strava activities to make them more fun, interesting, and full of personality - without any extra effort required!

You can choose from styles like:

* **Roast**: For some hilarious self-deprecation
* **Funny**: To add a lighthearted humour
* **Motivational**: For a little extra encouragement
* Or create your own **Custom Style**! - my new favourite now

It’s been amazing to see how creative people have gotten. Some of the interesting ones I've seen so far include:

* *Self-roasts that are absolutely brutal*
* *Activity names for a dog’s Strava account*
* *Custom roasts in German*
* *Style of Shakespearean characters*
* *Song quotes*

This is a **100% free passion project**, no paid tiers, just something I built for myself and others.  
If you’re interested, check it out here 👉 [**stravify.fun**](https://stravify.fun)

I’d love to hear your thoughts if you give it a try. Comment with your renamed activities here, and share your chosen styles too! It's quite funny to see what creative styles y'all will come up with hahaha

We're having a drinks and canape reception after the ceremony from 2:30-4:15, after which will be a 3 course meal served family style, which will be very hearty (antipasti, moroccan style lamb over couscous, plus several salad & carb options), and a light dessert. Then coffee & cake at 8pm. 

Guests will be given about 5 free drinks over the course of the evening, and apart from that we'll have a cash bar (so it's unlikely people will be getting completely wrecked).

**OVERVIEW:** Hi! My autistic/ADHD team at [ITI Assistive Technologies](http://itiassist.com) is doing research with the [Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities](https://dodd.ohio.gov/) on the potential impact of AI on decision-making for neurodivergent adults. We describe the research in greater detail [here](https://itiassistivetechnologies.com/consent-dodd-study/).

We are currently looking for US-based beta testers that are 18+ for our mobile app, Decide, that we created to aid us in this research. [Decide](http://itiassist.com/decide) is a personal decision assistant that combines AI, research-backed processes, and simple design to support neurodivergent adults with the daily choices they make. There are two tools within the app: **Guided** is an AI-powered tool that gives you context-relevant reflections and a recommendation for any decision. **Random** allows you to create lists for your daily routines, like your dopamine menu or favorite coffee orders, so you can pick randomly from them based on your energy level in the moment. Learn more about the features [here](http://itiassist.com/decide).

**BETA TEST PARTICIPATION:** To participate, visit [itiassist.com/decide](http://itiassist.com/decide) and choose the download link for your device (TestFlight for iOS\*, Google Play for Android). We ask beta testers to complete two surveys in the app: one during onboarding about yourself and your identity; one after two weeks about your experience with the app. Beta testers will get unlimited access to the app after they complete the first survey. If you have additional feedback on the app, you can use TestFlight (iOS) or Google Play (Android) to submit feedback or email us at support@itiassist.com.

In about a month, we're transitioning to a freemium model, with the paid tier kept at a very reasonable monthly price. Random will always be free, and there will be limited use of Guided on the free tier. We are exploring a limited-time Lifetime membership, so please comment below if you have strong feelings about this!

**CONTACT US:** We'd love you all to try it out and share with your autistic/ADHD friends (we also welcome non-ND folks to participate). Any support helps us to continue making assistive tech and conducting research on neurodivergent wellbeing. You can email [support@itiassist.com](mailto:support@itiassist.com) with questions or comments on your experience. Or just comment here! If you want to stay up to date, you can sign up for our very [spam-free newsletter](https://itiassistivetechnologies.com/contact/) or follow itiassist on IG. Thank you all!

**TL;DR** my autistic/ADHD team would love testers and feedback on our app [Decide](http://itiassist.com/decide), your personal decision assistant, for research with the Ohio Dept of Developmental Disabilities.



**\*iOS KNOWN BUG:** If you're asked for a code in TestFlight, just go back to [itiassist.com/decide](http://itiassist.com/decide) and follow the TestFlight link again, and it should allow you to try Decide. If you have any other issues, close TestFlight and the app, and reopen Decide directly from your home screen. If none of these fixes work, email us at [support@itiassist.com](mailto:support@itiassist.com)",1,1736791140.0,audhd,1,1.0,False
1i0k1vd,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1i0k1vd/a_breakthrough_in_pourover_brewing_as_a_relative/,A breakthrough in pourover brewing as a relative newbie,"I'm relatively new to specialty coffee and pourover brewing as a hobby - about a year ago I started out with a Switch and Baratza Encore. Early on, I was enjoying just going the full immersion route with the Switch but found that I wanted to start getting more clarity out of my brews and introduce some more testing and variety to the process. I tried many pourover methods - Hoffman's, 4:6, etc, and each came out tasting either super astringent, or sour, or muddy. It was disheartening because I found it hard to predict which way the brew would go wrong in a given day. 

I think what was happening is that the quality of my grinder (switched over to the 1zspresso Jx, same issues), combined with grinding way too finely, caused lots of channeling, stalling of the brew from fines, etc that always resulted in uneven extractions. I was influenced by a lot of videos and guides encouraging to go as fine as possible without tasting astringency to maximize extraction, but I really think this advice isn't good for pourover maybe unless you have an amazing grinder and technique.

The breakthrough for me came when I watched some of Lance Hedrick's pourover videos - specifically [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c34qcTTOLZY&t=842s) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoiXNMrTNgw&t=163s). I coarsened up my grind a lot - went from ~60 clicks to ~90 clicks on the Jx - and did Lance's 2-pour method with higher agitation pours, and the brews since have been blowing my mind. I finally understand what it means for a coffee to be ""sweet"", and I am actually able to pick out individual flavor notes from different beans. I really like Lance's reasoning that, for most people with lower-end grinders, you're best off going coarse on the grind to prevent channeling, and to make sure you get the best extraction for a given coffee, you vary parameters more in your control, i.e. pouring, agitation, and water temperature.

I hope my experience is helpful for anyone else finding themselves in a similar position. I know there isn't any one size fits all approach but these brewing principles really upped my pourover experience!",5,1736791133.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

My partner and I are starting a new venture at our local farmers market, and we’d love some advice from this amazing community. Our focus will be **steeped tea** (hot and cold-brewed) paired with **homemade pastries** and other foods that complement tea. Think of it as a cozy alternative to the coffee-heavy options already at the market.

Our plan is to test the waters during our first year to see what resonates before potentially moving to a brick-and-mortar space. Right now, we’re trying to narrow down the best beverages and foods to focus on—especially as a start-up.

Here’s what we’re considering so far:

* A selection of **hot teas**, steeped barista-style (loose-leaf only).
* **Cold-brew tea** options for a refreshing, on-the-go beverage.
* **Pastries and baked goods** that pair perfectly with tea (e.g., scones, tea cakes, or croissants).
* Possibly expanding into **other homemade foods** in the future, like finger sandwiches or seasonal treats.

If you’ve started a similar business or have experience with farmers markets, we’d love to hear your insights! What types of tea or pastries tend to sell well? Are there any trends we should look out for? And what would *you* love to see at a tea-focused booth?

Thanks so much in advance for your tips and suggestions! We’re excited to bring something new and delicious to the market and make it a welcoming space for tea lovers. 🍵✨",1,1736790618.0,cafe,0,1.0,False

The long of it is our day was his grandpa’s, mall to look at jewelry finally as this was my Christmas gift, then to see Kraven or another action movie (or just whatever was available that we haven’t seen since we have AMC A-List). I have psoriasis on my scalp & needed to wash my hair, so he said I could come shower first once we finished at grandpa’s.

At grandpa’s a new store came up, jokes about going all these places I want to go ensued, and we were going to stop there for me to grab a fruit tart.

Because of my pain levels I went to get in the passenger seat, and he asked me to drive so he could play Switch instead but had to go inside for his jacket. At this point I made a joke about jumping in the passenger seat and did. When he came back out he went to get in the driver’s seat and I said something along the lines of “Oh it was that easy? Dang, okay.” and proceeded to show my map hooked up, saying I was actually jk and going to drive. He was moody and refused to get out.

Then at the store, refused to go inside. I said never mind then, let’s just go home. This created a back and forth and ultimately I ended up driving anyways. We called a mediator, and we’re supposed to get off the phone to go finish our afternoon.

At that point, he said that he never intended to come back home for me to shower despite saying it, and that I should have known he meant that I could shower after grandpa’s but that it wasn’t “first” before going back to town. That he didn’t want to be on the road all day. (40-60 minutes max each way.) And that I should know that he wouldn’t want to be out on a work night. (Despite multiple previous instances of him suggesting movies late on work nights.) I shouldn’t be sad because we could plan to go do these things another day. We didn’t need to go to the city for the movies.

FF to today, conversation seems okay and then BOOM! I get a text about going to see a completely different movie before going to see the one we’ve been talking about going to, that I missed last night because he didn’t want to be out late on a work night. This seems to be common after arguments, so I pointed out to him that it feels like it’s intended to be a punishment or even a test of some sort.

Am I overreacting? Given previous way of doing things, and just being nice in my opinion, if you make plans and they fall through you should do those before doing something similar.

The The-Ensoulment

The The is a English post punk band that was founded by singer/songwriter Matt Johnson who remains the only sole member . Ensoulment is the group’s first album in nearly 25 years. The record is filled with moody melodic tracks highlighted by Johnson’s baritone.

The album opens with “Cognitive Dissident” which is about the recent Uk elections and the riots that resulted. Musically it has this flowing new wave groove highlighted by Johnson’s sturdy vocal delivery and swirling harmonies. “Some Days I Drink My Coffee On The Grave Of William Blake” has Johnson doing a spoken word delivery reminiscent of the late great Leonard Cohen. Sonically the track has this roving laid back melody. “Zen And The Art Of Dying” has this thumping dense groove that really highlights Johnson’s baritone vocal delivery. “Kissing The Ring Of The POTUS” discusses US political discourse in the worldview. “Life After Life” has this jazzy tinged swirling [sound.It](http://sound.It) is one of the lightest songs on the record. “I Want To Wake Up With You” feels more like a ritual rather than a love song. It has this surreal eerie sound. “Down By The Frozen River” is built around this sad piano riff that feels very bluesy. Once the band kicks in you are engulfed in a warm melodic harmony. “Risin Above The Need”feels like its from another time. It just feels very warm and nostalgic.”Linoelm Smooth To The Stockinged Foot” has this ambient electronic pulsating beat which gives it a darkness. “Where Do We Go When We Die?” has a dark soulfulness that is filled with age and wisdom. “I Hope You Remember (

The Things I Can’t Forget” has this roving rhythms that let the track wander around. It has a very blues tinged sound that make it stand out. The album closes with “A Rainy Day In May” is filled with hopefulness with Johnson’s warm baritone and tender strings it gives us all hope in our dark days. 

Another unexpected great late career album from a band that peaked decades ago. That seems to be one of the highlights of this decade. This album is filled with such dark lushness wich is perfect for Johnson’s baritone vocal delivery. An album that everyone should check it out and put on the year end bucket lists.

1i0jnek,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1i0jnek/life_is_hard/,Life is hard,"I work 60 hours or more a week, I'm picking up side gigs on top of that. I'm partially financially supporting multiple friends, a partner and got my sister a job where I am consistently covering for her and protecting her. Pretty much everyone I know is suffering from debilitating mental health issues and is needing both emotional and material support. My mom died when I was 17, my dad is a weird former alcoholic that jumps on every new bandwagon and fad, I have to keep a constant vigil because my landlord is always trying to illegally nickel and dime me, and my city is gentrifying. Everything is more expensive, less accessible and just f'ing harder every day. 

Had a huge issue come up with my boyfriend (G), that has shaken our relationship to its foundations. He's a former addict, and while he isn't using any substances, he has adopted his old patterns of behaviour around his new crush. Mostly a mix of dishonesty and losing priorities in his life (failing to ensure income, slipping in his care of his son, de-prioritizing our relationship and lying about it). We came to a better understanding of each other, and I love him. But it's hard having to accept that someone I've been with for two years is so easily capable of gaslighting and lying to me. And extra hard accepting that this is a fundamental part of him, and that anything that makes him feel really good is also probably going to have a good chance of triggering a similar pattern of behaviour. 

A really hard part is seeing how it is affecting his son (T). His kid is starved for attention, missing school way too often, seems to be incapable of prioritizing responsibilities, and is starting to show serious issues with being honest. The lil guy is 7, and he's already fibbing, concealing his motives, and normalizing deception. G isn't really able to internalize talks about this without feeling like a complete failure and shutting down. We're talking a lot about how life is all about failure, as Beckett said: “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” But failure hits G's insecurities too hard, and prevents his ability to accept his state, or work towards improving it. The bad is too big, and he shuts down further. I know we're making incremental progress, it's just hard.

I drank on Saturday.  I normally only have a couple spicy coffees on Christmas, and maybe 1-3 drinks over the rest of the year.  But on Saturday I polished half a 26.  The pain and pressure release was too good, and I fell asleep more easily than any time in recent memory.  I've had a few turns in the bottle, and I'm not too worried about spending a few months drunk, but, the pressure is there again.  And it's bloody hard.

I don't want to give the impression that it's all bad here.  G and I have a mostly loving, compassionate, considerate and wonderful relationship.  I think part of what's hard is is how much his behaviour changed.  I love his kid, he makes life an adventure, and reminds me to be curious.  He's an immensely sweet person, caring and considerate to *everyone*.  He's smart and funny, and a genuine joy to hang out with.  I have also recently rekindled a connection with a good friend/former partner that is bringing a lot of joy, warmth and goodness into my life.  And if I do survive the local reconstruction, my financial health should be the best it's been in my entire life.

It's all just really hard right now, thank you for reading, all the love and solidarity in rough times.",2,1736790127.0,GuyCry,4,0.75,False

    twenty years of age
    between your lips and my lips
    when they meet and stay
    the years collapse
    the glass of a whole life shatters.
    
    The day I met you I tore up
    all my maps
    an my prophecies
    like an Arab stallion I smelled the rain
    of you
    before it wet me
    heard the pulse of your voice
    before you spoke
    undid your hair with my hands
    before you had braided it
    
    There is nothing I can do
    nothing you can do
    what can the wound do
    with the knife on the way to it?
    
    Your eyes are like a night of rain
    in which ships are sinking
    and all I wrote is forgotten
    In mirrors there is no memory.
    
    God how is it that we surrender
    to love giving it the keys to our city
    carrying candles to it and incense
    falling down at its feet asking
    to be forgiven
    Why do we look for it and endure
    all that it does to us
    all that it does to us?
    
    Woman in whose voice
    silver and wine mingle
    in the rains
    From the mirrors of your knees
    the day begins its journey
    life puts out to sea
    
    I knew when I said
    I love you
    that I was inventing a new alphabet
    for a city where no one could read
    that I was saying my poems
    in an empty theater
    and pouring my wine
    for those who could not
    taste it.
    
    When God gave you to me
    I felt that He had loaded
    everything my way
    and unsaid all His sacred books.
    
    Who are you
    woman entering my life like a dagger
    mild as the eyes of a rabbit
    soft as the skin of a plum
    pure as strings of jasmine
    innocent as children's bibs
    and devouring like words?
    
    Your love threw me down
    in a land of wonder
    it ambushed me like the scent
    of a woman stepping into an elevator
    it surprised me
    in a coffee bar
    sitting over a poem
    I forgot the poem
    It surprised me
    reading the lines in my palm
    I forgot my palm
    It dropped on me like a blind deaf
    wildfowl
    its feathers became tangled with mine
    its cries were twisted with mine
    
    It surprised me
    as I sat on my suitcase
    waiting for the train of days
    I forgot the days
    I traveled with you
    to the land of wonder
    
    Your image is engraved
    on the face of my watch
    It is engraved on each of the hands
    It is etched on the weeks
    months years
    My time is no longer mine
    it is you.

My (24F) boyfriend (27M) and I have been together for about two years. It has been very rocky to say the least but also very fun and transformative. I love him very much. We have had many issues and we have worked through most of them although some remain. This past month I had my 24th birthday. (For background, my bf and I live about 2.5 hrs from eachother, I live in his hometown and he moved away to work a job. We got together after he moved. He moved away to get away from the partying and lifestyle of our hometown). For my 23rd and 22nd bday, I didn’t do anything to celebrate. He didn’t make an effort to do anything, and for my 22nd bday he worked and I had a friend visit me at his house. After work he took us to a kava bar (I don’t like kava) and then we went out to eat at a Mexican restaurant. This year I wanted to celebrate my birthday with my friends and him, because I have never done that since we have been together. 

My birthday rolls around and it’s on a Friday. He’s being a complete drag. Honestly don’t know if I’ve ever seen him in such mopey mood. He didn’t ask me what I wanted to do on my day. He moped all day. I wanted to get away from him because it was really upsetting me. I decided I wanted to go thrifting (he woke up and started telling me what he wanted to do, I didn’t want to do that). The whole day while we ran a few errands to thrift stores etc, he had his arms crossed and hood up on his jacket moping in my passenger seat. It literally ruined my day. Then my birthday party comes around that evening and he got absolutely wasted (we both did, I had fun but wish I hadn’t gotten so drunk) and the next day we were super hungover. The party was fun and I was super happy to celebrate with my friends (my best friends decorated my house and made it cute). The next day (and days following) he complained over and over about how it’s not worth it to party and get all drunk and how my party was not worth the hangover. (I hardly drink, and repeatedly express that I only want to drink on occasion, he is the one regularly drinking during the week and can hardly go a weekend without drinking) and I explained that it would’ve been fine if he hadn’t gotten so drunk and that I just wanted to celebrate my birthday. He basically made my whole birthday a drag, the day of, and the days after. It sucked. I always make sure his birthdays are fun. 

Fast forward 2 weeks later. My grandpa passed away in hospice, I spent his final days with him in his hospital room. It was very hard for me, my first time losing a close family member, and my grandpa and I were VERY close my entire life. It was a devastating loss for me. I returned from where my grandpa was staying after he passed, to my boyfriend’s house to be with him. Prior to my arrival he had meal prepped some meals and told me I was welcome to eat them while I’m there. I was very thankful for that and expressed it to him multiple times because that meant I didn’t have to cook and all I wanted to do was sleep. 2 days later I went home because I needed to return to work and honestly just needed some time alone. On the third day, Friday, my boyfriend came to visit me (we take turns visiting, every weekend). I cooked him dinner that evening and breakfast the next morning (important to note I am still very fresh in mourning my grandpa, as it had only been 4 days). Dinner time rolls around on Saturday and he is asking me what’s for dinner. I said idk, and we kinda moved on to a different subject. There was still leftovers in the fridge from the night before. I should also mention that I told him before he came for the weekend that I was very sad and not in the mood to do anything but be lazy for the weekend and that if he doesn’t want to do that, he doesn’t have to come and I wouldn’t fault him for staying home. 

A few minutes later our dogs start nagging us to take them out (I have 1 dog, he has 1 dog). I walked them in the morning in exchange for him going to get us coffee, and I also fed them, so I jokingly said you should walk them since I did it this morning. He said “don’t do something with the expectation of getting it back” I said “you should do that as well then” he asked what I was talking about, and i said you shouldn’t expect me to cook for you all weekend just because you did it for me last weekend. He said well alright then. I won’t cook for you anymore and if I do you can pay me for your half. And then he left and got food, and didn’t get me any. I laid in bed and took a nap because I didn’t have the energy to fight with him, I was sad enough as it is. He came in a couple hours later hugging and kissing me and said let’s be friends. No apology. I still hadn’t eaten since breakfast. The screenshot attached is the text he sent me right as he left to get food without me. 

I should add, our relationship is entirely 50/50, always has been, he makes 35% more money than me, but is adamant about splitting things, and often times I feel like I am actually carrying more of the weight financially. I used to visit him every weekend 2.5 hours away, before I had a house of my own for him to visit, and during that time, he never offered to pay for my gas, he cooks for me occasionally but never feeds me for an entire weekend except for last weekend, which was the days I was mourning my grandpa and honestly I feel like feeding me (while he is also feeding himself so literally just had to make extra food) should be the bare minimum for your partner who is mourning. He also has spoken a lot of him wanting me to “submit” to him, but he does not provide in any way. 

I actually haven’t reacted to this at all. But this whole past month has me feeling like I want to end this relationship. Am I overreacting? ",1,1736789973.0,AmIOverreacting,6,0.67,False

every time she’s stressed sa work or kahit sa ibang bagay, kami agad ang outlet niya. one time, nag-away sila ni dad, and instead of fixing things or talking it out, they were shouting at each other in front of me and my little brother. reminder lang: may trauma ako sa sigawan, and my little brother too. tapos during that fight, binagsak niya yung laptop ko out of anger. wala akong kaalam-alam sa away nila, pero ako ang napagbuntunan. now, wala na akong laptop, and i have to borrow my brother’s iPad for online classes. it’s so unfair kasi parang hindi niya naiisip kung paano naapektuhan yung mga ginagawa niya.

the worst part? kapag nagagalit ako or nagrereact sa mga ginagawa niya, lagi niyang sinasabi, ‘sana hindi na lang namin kayo dinala dito kung ganyan ugali niyo.’ like, first of all, nasa ibang bansa kami ngayon and wala sa pinas. sino bang nagsabi na dalhin niya kami dito? wala naman, ‘di ba? pero parang kasalanan pa namin lahat ng frustrations niya. it’s so unfair kasi she acts like everything is our fault when everything is because of their decisions.

then there’s my dad. sobra rin siyang nakakainis. kapag galit siya, ang tendency niya is either manigaw or manakit, which is so toxic. ilang beses na niyang halos binugbog yung little brother ko, and he’s not even 7 years old yet. paano nila nagagawa sa amin yun? it’s like they don’t see us as people with feelings. nakakatrauma talaga kasi instead of feeling safe sa bahay, it feels like we’re constantly walking on eggshells.

hindi lang yun. kahit sa simpleng bagay, sobrang toxic nila. kapag may kailangan ako for school, parang ang hirap mag-ask ng tulong kasi either sasagutin nila ako ng masama o parang kasalanan ko pa na kailangan ko ng something. tapos, kapag may mali silang nagawa, hindi nila inaamin. lagi nilang sinisisi sa amin kahit alam mo naman na hindi namin kasalanan.

and honestly, parang wala talagang effort to understand us. they expect us to respect them, pero they don’t even treat us properly. kahit yung basic na emotional support, wala. it’s exhausting kasi it feels like no matter what we do, we’re always wrong in their eyes.

Here are five key lessons, illustrated with examples from Indian brands making waves recently:

1. **A Great Product Isn’t Enough** Having a unique offering is just step one; getting people to notice it is the real challenge. Take **Alpino** for instance—a brand known for its peanut butter and plant-based protein products. They didn’t stop at creating healthy alternatives; they actively built a strong presence by engaging with health-conscious communities online, ensuring people knew the value of their products.
2. **Your Target Market Isn’t Everyone** Trying to please everyone usually results in pleasing no one. Brands like **Whole Truth Foods** have laser-focused on clean-label snacks, catering to fitness enthusiasts who value transparency in what they consume. By sticking to their niche, they’ve cultivated a loyal audience.
3. **Storytelling is Essential** Startups thrive when they tell stories people connect with. **Sleepy Owl**, the cold brew coffee brand, mastered this by emphasizing convenience and quality for urban professionals juggling hectic schedules. Their narrative resonates, making them stand out in a competitive market.
4. **Adaptability is Key** The startup journey rarely goes as planned. **Eat Better Co.**, which started with traditional snacks, quickly pivoted to focus on health-conscious, modern versions of classic Indian treats. Adapting to customer feedback helped them grow in a competitive space.
5. **Community Over Competition** Building a community can sometimes outweigh direct competition. Brands like **Yoga Bar** didn’t just sell protein bars—they created an ecosystem for fitness enthusiasts to share tips, recipes, and inspiration. This approach solidified their place in the market.

These startups are great examples of how challenges can be turned into opportunities with the right approach. Have you noticed any similar inspiring brands on this season of Shark Tank India? Let’s discuss!",1,1736789875.0,StartUpIndia,0,1.0,False

1i0jgjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1i0jgjv/im_speechless/,I'm speechless,"My wife (F32) and I (M33) have been together for 10 years, married for 2. We’ve had our ups and downs, but I’m starting to think this all goes back to the start when she said she wanted tattoos and piercings. She has a bunch of plans for tattoos and even wanted a nose ring. I told her straight up, I wasn’t a fan, but I wasn’t gonna stop her. I just didn’t think it was something I was into. She asked if we were incompatible over it, which felt like a weird question. Of course I love her and want to be with her. But I still struggled when she got the nose ring. It’s small and on the side, so I thought I could deal with it. But honestly, it bugged me. It became all I could focus on when we’d kiss or take pictures together. It just felt wrong and made her less attractive to me. I was also annoyed that she didn't really care if I thought it looked good or not. 

A few months ago she took the nosering out. I asked if she was changing the jewelry but she said she just wasn't feeling it anymore. I asked if it was because of me and she was honest and said a little bit. I told her she didn't need to but thanked and hugged her. When people asked about it she just told them it was getting irritated. 

Then, last month she came home with bruises on her face. I freaked out, asked her what happened, and she casually says, “Oh, some homeless guy punched me on my way to work.” I asked if she needed to go to the hospital, and she was like, “Nah, it’s whatever.” I was totally thrown off, but she didn’t care, so I tried to let it go.

This week, she comes home with a busted lip. I asked if it was the same guy, and she just shrugged. She had no idea, and acted like it was no big deal. That’s when I started getting really worried, but she kept brushing it off. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. She’s usually pretty upset when people mess with her on the street, so this was all just really off. I even considered calling in sick to follow her on her commute but I knew that was crazy and wouldn't work. 

We went for a walk yesterday to grab some coffee. We were going to sit down at the place and enjoy ourselves but she suddenly insists we leave the coffee shop and go to the park, but she’s acting weird about it. I noticed she was eyeing a group of guys who were clearly looking at her too. When I went to ask everything to go instead, one of them came up to me, smiled and asked if I was dating my wife. I said “Yeah, we’re married,” and he just laughed and told me “Your wife’s a fucking freak, bro.” At that point, I was pissed so I started asking him if he was the one who hit her. He just said “Ask your wife.”

That’s when I totally lost it. My wife came in and dragged me out of there telling me to calm down. I started asking if she was cheating or what was going on, and she finally told me, “I paid them to punch me.” I thought she was joking, but she wasn’t. She paid them $50 each time, and she said she did it because she was tired of feeling like crap and wanted to try it out. I had to sit her down and ask if she really wanted to be punched in the face, and she said yes. She wants to be punched, even after seeing how I reacted. She says it feels like a release. 

Honestly, I feel like I’m losing my mind. I don’t know what to do here. She’s got a therapy appointment next week and I told her I want to go with her and have her tell the therapist what she just told me. My younger sister used to self-harm, and we had to take her to the hospital for it, and this feels kind of similar. Do I take her to the hospital? What do I even tell them? This is so crazy I can’t even talk to anyone about it. I’m just stuck in this by myself right now.

TLDR: My wife has been having some weird issues, and now she’s paying people to punch her in the face. I don’t know how to handle it.",1,1736789642.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

Ever find yourself staring at the ceiling in the morning, feeling trapped under the warm covers, knowing there's a world of responsibilities waiting for you, yet the motivation just isn't there? It happens to the best of us. But don't worry—you're not alone, and I'm here to share some tips and stories to help you get out of that bed and seize the day! 💪

**1. Start with Gratitude 🙏**  
Before your feet hit the floor, take a moment to practice gratitude. Think of three things you’re grateful for—no matter how small. Maybe it's the comfort of your bed, the aroma of your morning coffee, or the potential new experiences awaiting you. This simple act can shift your mindset and boost your mood, setting a positive tone for the day.

**2. Break It Down 🧩**  
Overwhelm often cripples motivation. Instead of thinking of all you need to accomplish in a day, break your tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. For instance, rather than stressing over work reports, focus on the first segment you need to complete. Celebrate each small victory, as these create a momentum of achievement that propels you forward.

**3. Create a Morning Ritual 🌅**  
A strong morning ritual can be your anchor. It doesn't have to be elaborate; even a 5-10 minute routine that includes stretching, breathing exercises, or journaling can work wonders. By consistently starting your day with activities that nurture your mind and body, you set a foundation for success and motivation.

**4. Visualize Your Goals 🎯**  
Spend a few minutes visualizing what achieving your goals looks like. Picture yourself not just holding that coveted job position or finishing that marathon but feel the happiness and fulfillment of having achieved it. Visualization turns your dreams into a roadmap, reminding you why getting out of bed is worth it!

**5. Connect with Community 🤝**  
Lean on your Empowish community. Share your struggles and triumphs—it's a journey we're taking together. When you realize others are walking a similar path and feel the same challenges, it can be incredibly motivating. We're just a post away from a flood of encouragement and inspiration. ✨

Remember, it's okay to have tough days, but how you respond makes all the difference. Every morning is an opportunity for a new beginning—embrace it.

So, lovely people, what motivates you to get out of bed on those tough days? Share your stories and strategies in the comments below! Let’s lift each other up and transform those dreams into reality, one step at a time. 🚀🌈

    It taught me that when I love,
    The earth stands still!
    Your love showed me what hallucination is,
    It taught me how to love you in every little thing,
    In the bare, autumn trees,
    In the falling, yellow leafs,
    In the rain,
    In every cafeteria in which we drank our black coffee,
    My lady, your love taught me to sleep in nameless hotels,
    And to sit by nameless shores,
    It taught me to weep without tears,
    Your love taught me how to grieve,
    And for centuries I needed a woman to make me grieve,

# 29 Annoyed at Small Things

### Republic Spacer Training Center, McMurdo (2,400 Ls)

**POV: Durnio, Malgeir Federation Navy (Rank: Delta Leader)**

“Fire! Active fire in midsection hallway Two-Bravo! Fire! Fire! Fire!”

“That’s all of you!” Durnio screamed at his group of wide-eyed spacer cadets. “Get your vacuum gear on now! Let’s go! Let’s go! Move it!”

The group consisted of 40 freshly recruited Malgeir spacers. Half of them had some years of experience in the Federation Navy. The other half were straight out of boot camp. Or what passed for it in the Federation, anyway.

All of them were equally unprepared. 

They fumbled to get the EVA closets open. A scant few of them managed to unfold their issued gear correctly, and he saw at least one of them skimming the instruction pictures printed on the gear.

“Hurry up! Hurry!” Durnio yelled unnecessarily to lend to the simulated stress. “Get it on now!”

It took the best of them two minutes to put on their EVA suit. The average was just over three.

“Four minutes and twenty seconds,” he said, staring at his stopwatch as the last, embarrassed spacer cadet struggled to secure his tail into his suit. “That’s how long before we can begin pumping atmosphere out of this module. The whole section would have burnt to a crisp by now… or, more likely, they’d seal this off and suck the air out before you finish putting on your suit to save the rest of the ship.”

He glared at the youthful cadets lined up in front of him. Several of them hadn’t even properly secured their air lines. One of them was trying to scratch an itch on his snout through the EVA visor.

Another raised her paw in question.

He turned to face her. “Question, Pack Member?”

“Yes, Delta Leader, I have a question. What is the baseline?”

Durnio’s face lit up with a bright smile. “Good question, Pack Member! The Republic Navy qualification standard is thirty seconds, twenty for combat ships. And that’s for every member of the pack. Think they’ll allow us an exception on account of your extra long tail?”

She mumbled something unintelligible.

“Sorry, I didn’t hear that, Pack Member!”

“No, Delta Leader!”

“Excellent! That’s what I thought. Now strip it down, place your suits back in the locker in a neatly folded fashion, and let’s try this again. Let’s shoot for only burning half the module down this time.”

The pack shouted in unison, “Yes, Delta Leader!”

++++++++++++++++++++++++

“How goes the cadet herding?” Maurice greeted Durnio as the Malgeir joined his table in the mess hall.

“It’s… going. We’re doing vacuum drills today,” he said, sitting down and biting hungrily into his burger.

“Ah, I remember those,” Maurice said with a nostalgic smile. “What’s your group at?”

“We got it down to a minute flat at the end of the day.”

Maurice gave him a look of mild approval. “Not bad… not bad at all.”

“Sure… if they were going to be flying cargo ships,” Durnio sighed. “But this group is going to a combat command. The new ship.”

“Ah, the new Alligator-classes. Same for me, probably.”

“Alligator-class?” Durnio asked in confusion. “I thought they were going to be called it something else.”

“Yeah, there’s some online poll going on,” Maurice dismissed it casually with a wave. “But that’s the official name. The spacer crew can call it whatever it wants, and the scuttlebutt is they’re calling it the alligator, because of all the bumps on the top where the missiles come out.”

“Ah, I see,” he replied, even though he didn’t see it at all. “What do they have you doing these days?”

“Hah. Just lounging around, training more of your Marines for when we need to take Grantor.”

Durnio’s eyes widened. “Grantor?!”

“Yep. Tens of millions of Buns down there. We gotta retake it somehow.”

“I sort of assumed you were just going to send combat robots in until it falls.”

“We **are** going to send robots. And your Marines.” Maurice shrugged. “There are enough Buns for everyone to kill. And they’re not going to wait until we scale up robotic production to be able to replace all your millions of Marines one-to-one. Every day we wait is another day the Buns get to keep the planet.”

“I guess. What are you drilling them on now?”

“It’s crazy,” Maurice said animatedly, gesturing emphatically with his hands. “Apparently you guys have these tin cans that you send people into atmosphere with—”

“Oh yeah, the drop pods?” Durnio said casually as he picked up a fry.

Maurice looked at him with a side-eye. “Yeah, totally nuts.”

“What’s wrong with them? They’re fast.”

“They’re incredibly dangerous! What if they malfunction?! What if they don’t drop in the right place?!” Maurice asked. “Fire a thruster half a second later, you’re in the wrong city! Five seconds, wrong continent! It’s a recipe for disaster!”

“But it’s— it’s war. We all have to take risks.”

“Not these unnecessary ones. Anyway… I think we’ve decided we’re going to put our combat robots in those instead, and your Marines will come down in shuttles after they clear the airspace. We’re training them to use real re-entry shuttles instead of those death traps.”

“What about you guys? Are you Grass Eaters just going to train our Marines to do all the hard work for you?” Durnio teased.

Maurice grinned at him. “Pretty much. That’s what pets are for, after all.”

Durnio wagged a claw at him in mock admonishment. “Careful, you’re not supposed to say that about us anymore. If I report you to your Office of—”

“Oh no! Not more alien cultural awareness online training!”

++++++++++++++++++++++++

*In the early days of the Terran Republic, after the “unification” of humanity, a retired Marine general and a Navy admiral found themselves sharing war stories at the counter of a quiet bar. The bartender, catching snippets of their dialogue, leaned in. After introducing himself and some small talk, he posed a question to them, “What does it take to conquer a midsized rogue district? Say, like you did North Korea.”*

*The Marine general leaned back with a confident smile. “Just two divisions,” he replied.*

*“Only two divisions?” the bartender echoed, eyebrows raised.*

*“That’s right,” said the general as he nodded vigorously. “Forty thousand of our elite combat drones working alongside their well-trained Marine operators. The new Model-18s are perfectly suited for the harsh realities of war — far superior to human infantry in frontline combat. Fully autonomous operations, networked all-spectrum dominance, sub-millisecond killchain, all that jazz. One division to secure the cities, and another to clean up the country-side.”*

*The Navy admiral spoke up as she shook her head. “Hah. Two full divisions? Typical Marine overkill. We’d need even less,” she said smugly.*

*“Oh yeah?”*

*“We’d just need two squadrons of ships.”*

*“Only two squadrons?!” the bartender asked, turning to her.*

*“Indeed,” the admiral said proudly. “Republic Navy warships are unmatched in firepower, mobility, and situational awareness. One squadron to neutralize their surface-to-orbit defense network, another to systematically reduce their ground troops from orbit until they plead for mercy.”*

*Just then, a scoff came from a nearby stool. A man leaned over out of the dark corner. “Two squadrons?” he snorted dismissively.*

*Curious, the bartender glanced over. “And who might you be?”*

*“I work for a defense logistics firm on Luna,” the man replied nonchalantly.*

*The admiral’s eyes narrowed as she recognized the man. “He’s TRO,” she said, with equal distaste and unease.*

*“TRO?” the bartender repeated. “What’s that?”*

*“Terran Reconnaissance Office,” the admiral explained. “Spies, saboteurs, and swine.”*

*“And what might you need to conquer a rogue district?”*

*The man took a slow sip of his drink. “Two.”*

*“Two what?”*

*“Two people.”*

*“Two people?!” the bartender said, astonished. “Who?”*

*“One to take out the Supreme Leader, and one to take their place.”*

### Naval Station Europa, Europa (100 km)

**POV: “Hersh”, Terran Reconnaissance Office**

“You’ve changed color,” Ditvish observed.

“Changed color?” Hersh asked and looked down at his arms. “Ah, the tan. It’s our skin’s natural reaction to exposure to sunlight. Or starlight.”

“Don’t you have medications to fix that?”

“Sunscreen? Eh, I just get used to it. We asked your people if we could agree to only fight at night, but I think they said no.”

Ditvish humored him with a snort and eye roll.

“And I see you’ve done a lot more reading while I was gone,” Hersh remarked dryly at the former fleet master’s shelf. He glanced at some of the titles. Most of it was fiction, but there was a diverse mix of biographies and autobiographies in there. Some were famous generals and admirals in Earth’s history. And at least one from an old movie star.

“There is nothing else to do here,” Ditvish complained.

Hersh turned back and sat down at the table. “What about the board games?” He flipped a switch on the table, and a holographic chess set appeared on its surface. “Fancy some chess?”

“Bah, I know that one. Some of your commissars tried to teach it to me.”

“And?”

“It is a far poorer simulation of warfare than it purports to be. Symmetry?! It is… uninteresting to me.”

“What about Diplomacy?”

“Pointless predator notions— oh, you mean the board game? I tried it once with a few of your Marines.”

“And?”

“They cheated.”

“That’s kind of the point of that game, no?”

“No, they read my mind.”

“We don’t just give random Marines access to our mind reader technology.”

“I’m not sure how,” Ditvish said, slightly flustered as he recalled the memory. “But they always knew somehow!”

“Maybe you are simply bad at lying. Have you considered that?”

“No. Your games are stupid. I refuse to play any more of them.”

“Fair enough.” Hersh dismissed the table’s holographic device. “We can just talk about you instead, if you want?”

“Talk about me? What is there to talk about? You’ve already extracted everything of intelligence value from my mind.”

“For one, what are your personal goals?”

“My personal goals?”

“If you get out of here, what would you want to do?” Hersh elaborated.

He stared at the human in disbelief. “If I get out of here?!” 

“Well, yeah. When we win this war, you’re probably going to get out of here, right? What will you do then?”

“When you win this war?” he repeated, then muttered again, “When you win this war…”

Hersh remained silent.

“I guess that is not an impossibility,” Ditvish admitted after a minute.

“Right, and if the war ends, we’d let you go. We’re not going to just let you sit here and eat our free food forever. So what are you going to do then?”

“That is an absurd hypothetical.”

“Humor me.”

Ditvish thought for a moment. “I suppose if you let me go, I’d report to my overdue assignment of responsibility hearing. I guess State Security will find me at fault for abandoning the Prophecy, on top of whatever charges they already imposed on me before I surrendered, and then they’d shoot me.”

“Okay, say they don’t do that. What would you want to do? Become a farmer?” Hersh pointed at his bookshelf. “Maybe a librarian? A writer?”

“That is another absurd hypothetical.”

“Humor me again.”

“Perhaps they will put me in charge of another fleet, and we will invade another species. Perhaps another species easier than yours to conquer.” Ditvish paused and shook his head. “No. That is completely nonsensical. They would never trust me enough to allow me to command again. This line of questioning is pointless for both of us.”

Hersh shrugged. “Alright then. Suit yourself.”

“What about you?” Ditvish asked.

He blinked in surprise at the reversal. “Huh?”

“What about you, Hersh? What are you going to do when this war ends? I understand your people— how do they put it in that book— ah, when the war ends, you beat your swords into plowshares. What is your plowshare?”

Hersh studied the former fleet master for a moment. “I… I don’t know. I’ve been in the service since I was eighteen. This job is what I’m good at. I’d need to think about it for a bit.”

“Aha!” Ditvish looked at him with mild triumph. “So it is not just me who can’t easily answer the question to your satisfaction. Your species — at least some of you — you gravitate towards what you call mindless violence. Just as much as you accuse us of doing it.”

Hersh thought for a moment before answering, “I want to go back to being annoyed by small things.”

It was Ditvish’s turn to be confused. “Annoyed by small things?”

“My mother was in the Navy, in the ODT. She fought pirates and terrorist groups in our Red Zone for twenty years. Day in and day out. Those were violent times. The Republic did some terrible things to the people in the Red Zone. And the people there — they gave it back as good as they got. She was in the midst of it all. Hostage rescue. Intelligence gathering. Assassinations. Even went undercover once. It was… brutal.”

“So your mother was doing the job you are doing now?”

“Things are better today in the Red Zone. The war’s over. We’ve got tech startups on Mimas now. It’s not even the frontier anymore. The frontier has moved. Even during this last campaign…”

“But if things were still as bad as they were when your—”

“Yes. Then, I’d be doing what she did too, probably.” Hersh shrugged. “When she was forty, my mom stopped. Just couldn’t do it anymore. Our implants and biotechnology were not as good back then. She stopped being combat effective — couldn’t keep up with the young operators with their brand-new bodies and lightning reflexes, so they put her in a desk job. And she had us. So when her enlistment was up, she took early retirement and went back to school.”

“Retraining?” Ditvish asked. “We have that too. For those few who are worthy of the resource investment.”

“Kind of. Went back to college on the Navy’s dime. And she didn’t fit in. All the students… they were just kids. None of them understood what she did in the Red Zone. Some of them even opposed it and told her that to her face.” He shook his head ruefully as he recalled. “They were kids. They complained about having to wake up at eight for morning lectures. And what was she going to tell them? That — back in the ODT, in the Red Zone — she had to wake up every day at five to triple-check their equipment in case one of the local technicians sabotaged their air tanks? That sometimes she was in combat condition for weeks on end, relying only on the combat stimulants in her bloodstream to keep her awake? That she woke up twice a night — every night without fail — because of nightmares she had? My mom couldn’t tell them that. She just didn’t fit in with the other students.”

“What did she end up doing?” Ditvish asked curiously.

“She adapted. Because that’s what humans do. We adapt. My mom was no different. She saw a doctor. Several doctors. The nightmares went away, mostly. And one day, a few years later, she was standing in line at a coffee shop for her coffee. They spelled her name wrong on her cup. And she found herself being annoyed at it so much she almost complained.”

“Spelling your name wrong… is that a major error worthy of severe punishment in your culture?”

Hersh smiled at the memory. “No, it is inconsequential; the most inconsequential of mistakes. And she got annoyed. Just like anyone normal would have been. Just like any of her young classmates would. She didn’t think about people shooting at her. She didn’t worry about anything else. She was simply… annoyed that they spelled her name wrong on a disposable paper cup. That was the moment when my mom realized the war was over for her.” 

“Ah. So that is what you meant when you said: you want to be annoyed at the small things.”

“Yes, when this war is over. You?”

Ditvish shook his head. “Like I said, the war will never end for me. I was bred for it. That is the sole purpose of my life. Without one, I would be recycled. My bloodline would be kept in storage until needed. And the resources spent on me would be repurposed for something more constructive.”

“What if that were not the case? What if you could choose? What if you could choose to be something other than a ten whiskers of the Navy?”

“I don’t know, Hersh,” Ditvish said quietly, uncertainty creeping into his voice. “I don’t even know what my options would be.”

“Plenty of wisdom in those books you’ve been reading to answer that question,” Hersh said as he began packing his tablet. “Just something for you to think about until I come by next time.”

As Hersh stood up to leave, Ditvish looked up at him, his alien expression near-unreadable. “I suppose— I suppose I would like to be annoyed at small things too.”

I am 5""11"", well educated and I keep in shape with a mix of things like the gym, swimming and I like hiking now and again. Currently building out a campervan in my rav4 to travel and live in as I work remote so trying to make the most of it.

I am in a good place career wise, been pretty ambitious my whole life and worked pretty hard to get where I am now. Currently living in Alberta, moved here from the UK back in 2022. I travel to the states for work every couple of months as well. I do not really feel tied down right now where I live. I have done a lot of traveling in the past, did a roadtrip around Iceland and been to a few different states.

I would say I am a homebody at heart, I volunteer with cats in my spare time. Been addicted to OSRS again but I also like going out to eat, currently got back into reading at coffee places. I enjoy trying different cuisines as well and chilling on my sofa watching the odd show if I have not already spoiled it for myself already through YouTube clips. Tried a few different things in the past likes streaming, making my own video game on Unity but ADHD (officially diagnosed) stops me in my tracks after a bit. I also put a lot of effort making good food as well.

Looking for someone to share experiences with and just enjoy life, feel like I have reached where I need to be in life and I am ready to share that with someone. I am the kind of person that prefers a small group of friends but they are also the ones you can trust and talk too about anything. I enjoy social settings in small doses, I go through phases where I can be around groups of people now and again but other times I can stay at home for days on end and I would just talk to my cat instead if I had one.

I will say I am obsessed with cats but I am not a dog person.

A chance encounter in a coffee shop, a shared laugh over something insignificant, or a connection through words on a page. It always feels like love has this way of slipping into the cracks of our lives, uninvited yet desperately needed. It’s poetic and maddening all at once.

But the other side of it—the heartbreak—can be devastating. It leaves you raw, questioning everything, even your own worth. I think the hardest part is that it feels so final in the moment, like the last page of a book you weren’t ready to finish. Yet, if love can find us in the strangest ways, maybe it can heal us just as mysteriously. A kind gesture from a stranger, a dog resting its head on your knee, a song you didn’t know you needed. The world has a funny way of piecing us back together when we least expect it.

Maybe heartbreak isn’t the end but a reminder to keep going. To stay open. To believe that love—whatever form it takes—hasn’t finished finding us yet.",6,1736789159.0,PHSapphics,4,1.0,False

Never rlly thought I’d be in this situation, and I don’t even know if I should be posting this. I (19f) recently graduated high school, and one of my teachers (28M) has always been someone I looked up to. He was the cool, approachable (mistly substitute) teacher who always gave great advice and believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself. 

We started talking more during my senior year, mostly about school and future plans. But I noticed how he looked at me and He’d always say things like, “You’re so mature for your age” or “You’re going to do amazing things.” At the time, I didn’t think much of it—it felt harmless.

Last week, I went back to visit the school to see some old teachers, and I ran into him. He asked if I wanted to grab coffee to catch up, and I said yes. At first, it was normal, just talking about life after graduation. But then he got quiet and said, “I’ve always felt like we had a connection. I couldn’t say anything before, but now that you’ve graduated…”

I was stunned. I didn’t rlly know what to say. He’s not that much older than me, but it still feels… wrong? 💀 He’s been texting me since, asking if I want to meet up again, and I’m completely torn.

Is this normal? Am I thinking too much bout it? I don’t want to blow this out of proportion, but I also don’t know if this is something I should even consider. Don’t get me wrong, he IS hot and my type too. Any advice?

I have successfully lost 10lbs now. My method is that (since I have no self control) I asked my husband for him ONLY THIS YEAR to serve me breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The portions controlled and everything (NO HE DOES NOT COOK IT ALL, I slice all vegetables and make all the salads on sundays so that the only thing he does is take the vegetables put it in the pan and cook it with eggs in the morning) Everything went great until today. I asked him yesterday if he could make me some coffee and today he took hot water and threw the coffee inside, it looked like tea and this was the conversation:

~him: Why are u making that face?

~Me: No honey don’t worry I will drink it it’s no problem, it’s just like it looks like tea and doesn’t smell like coffe but please don’t worry about it I can drink it! It’s even healthier for me!

~him: Nono, I will make it on the coffee machine

~Me: Noo please don’t it’s not an issue please

~him: Yes, give me the cup

~Me: No I won’t

~Him: sweetie, GIVE me the CUP

he proceeded to take the cup by force and spilled it all over the table and then threw the coffee away in the sink. I stood up crying and locked myself in my office. Minutes later he knocked and stood in the door for an hour. He is excusing himself saying that he told me he was going to make a new coffee with the coffee machine and that he was sorry for being mediocre. He also said and I quote “I’m sorry but I told you many times to give me the cup and you refused what else could I do?” And this to me sounded like when an abuser hits the woman and says “well you provoked it” 

Similar scenes to this, have happened in the past. Please I need better judgement. I am very grateful to him for serving me my meals. (If you stay and read I will tell you the reason why I asked him to serve me the meals)

So everytime I go on a diet and exercise I have noo problem with exercise. But the diet part is very hard for me bc even though I cook EVERYTHING healthy and ready for me in the fridge, I lack the discipline of ACTUALLY eating what I cooked for myself. My thought process goes like this: “Ugh I gotta stand up and eat… and serve me that salad with salmon…. ugh… it’s gonna be a pain. Well I’m not that hungry right now so it can wait” And later when I am ACTUALLY HUNGRY i tend to get so hungry that I cannot physically control myself from eating way too much. So it has helped me a lot having me cooking and prepping everything and my husband only serving it to me. ",2,1736788590.0,AITAH,22,0.75,False

I’m thinking about this question from a chemical perspective in terms of solubility and initial concentrations present in coffee (ex: Acidity seems to readily extract much more than bitter components, is this because it is in higher concentrations in the bean, more easily dissolved in water, a combination etc?)

I’m also trying to understand extraction of the different “tasting notes” and how I should adjust my brews accordingly. I’m assuming many of these are aromatic compounds, and so I would imagine that hotter water and finer grind  = more extraction = more flavor in cup, but that’s not always the case. My brews can be good but “muddied” flavor (not body). I’m finding that the tasting notes of percolation/cupping brews are much clearer than my pour overs. My ultimate goal is to create a clean balanced cup with identifiable notes. I’ve been trying low agitation, low extraction techniques but they still aren’t fully hitting the mark. How do I find the balance?

Any advice? Happy Monday!

Welcome back to our [UPG of the Week](https://imgur.com/a/HXEtifm)! We are starting off this year with a personal request from u/Ciroflexo, which is exciting that literally anyone wants to see the UPG posts.

This week we are looking at the **Shihuh in UAE**.

# Region: United Arab Emirates

[UAE map](https://preview.redd.it/ko3lxe26esce1.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1c690c94643eb1aceafec040ad9ab77b17e214f)

**Stratus Index Ranking** **(Urgency): 96**

It has been noted to me by u/JCmathetes that I should explain this ranking. Low numbers are more urgent, both physically and spiritually together, while high numbers are less urgent. The scale is 1-177, with one number assigned to each country. So basically on a scale from Afghanistan (1) to Finland (177), how urgent are the peoples physical and spiritual needs.

[Jebel Hafeet](https://preview.redd.it/5ecm5xr8fsce1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4c32019fd6140d4c576890451c31f54868eaa8)

**Climate**: The climate of the UAE is subtropical-arid with hot summers and warm winters. The climate is categorized as desert climate. The hottest months are July and August, when average maximum temperatures reach above 45 °C (113 °F) on the coastal plain. In the Hajar Mountains, temperatures are considerably lower, a result of increased elevation. Average minimum temperatures in January and February are between 10 and 14 °C (50 and 57 °F). During the late summer months, a humid southeastern wind known as Sharqi (i.e. ""Easterner"") makes the coastal region especially unpleasant. The average annual rainfall in the coastal area is less than 120 mm (4.7 in), but in some mountainous areas annual rainfall often reaches 350 mm (13.8 in). Rain in the coastal region falls in short, torrential bursts during the winter months, sometimes resulting in floods in ordinarily dry wadi beds. The region is prone to occasional, violent dust storms, which can severely reduce visibility.

**Terrain:** The UAE coast stretches for nearly 650 km (404 mi) along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf, briefly interrupted by an isolated outcrop of the Sultanate of Oman. Most of the coast consists of salt pans that extend 8–10 km (5.0–6.2 mi) inland. The largest natural harbor is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere.

South and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling sand dunes merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia. The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation. The extensive Liwa Oasis is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia.

The Western Hajar Mountains (*Jibāl Al-Ḥajar Al-Gharbī*), rising in places to 2,500 m (8,200 ft), separate Al-Batinah coast from the rest of the UAE. Beginning at the UAE-Oman border on the Persian Gulf coast of the *Ras Musandam* (Musandam Peninsula), the Western Mountains extend southeastward for about 150 km (93 miles) to the southernmost UAE-Oman frontier on the Gulf of Oman. The range continues as the Eastern Hajar Mountains (*Jibāl Al-Ḥajar Ash-Sharqī*) for more than 500 km (310 miles) into Oman. The steep mountain slopes run directly to the shore in many places.

**Wildlife of UAE**: Large terrestrial mammals still found in the United Arab Emirates include the Arabian tahr, the Arabian oryx and the sand gazelle. Carnivores include the Arabian wolf, the striped hyena, the red fox, the Blanford's fox, the Rüppell's fox, the Asiatic caracal, the Arabian wildcat, the sand cat and formerly the Arabian leopard. Other mammals include the Cape hare, the Brandt's hedgehog, the desert hedgehog and the long-eared hedgehog. The Egyptian fruit bat is found here during most of the year, but moves around according to the availability of fruit. Insectivorous bats include the sac-winged bat, the mouse-tailed bat and the leaf-nosed bat. Small rodents include the lesser Egyptian jerboa, the Cheesman's gerbil and the Balochistan gerbil. There are thirteen species of terrestrial snake, some of the largest being the sand boa, the saw-scaled viper and the horned viper, and four species of sea snake as well as green sea turtles present in the Persian Gulf. The Environment Agency Abu Dhabi recorded the sighting of an Arabian caracal in Jebel Hafeet, which is the first sighting in a long while.

Thankfully, there are no monkeys in the UAE, praise the Lord!

**Environmental Issues:** The UAE has dangerously high air pollution levels, creating major health risks for its citizens and residents. They also struggle with scarcity of freshwater and desertification.

**Languages:** Modern Standard Arabic is the national language of the United Arab Emirates. English is the most commonly spoken language, whereas Emirati Arabic, a variety of Gulf Arabic, is spoken natively by Emirati people. The Shihuh speak Shihhi, a form of localized Arabic.

**Government Type:** Federal Islamic semi-constitutional monarchy

# People: Shihuh in UAE

[Shihuh man](https://preview.redd.it/1ngvrl8disce1.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=fac9f162e2d46483942b4fcd0dde1496afa87815)

**Population**: 19,000

**Estimated Foreign Workers Needed:** 3+

**Beliefs:** The Shihuh are 0% Christian. That means out of their population of 19,000, there are maybe only a handfull of Christians.

The Shihuh are Sunni Muslims who also depend on the spirit world for their daily lives. Islam is an important part of their identity.

[Mosque in UAE](https://preview.redd.it/3talx9hnisce1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=896253260f4a0af26fd76023c04958e74efb2da1)

**History:** Historically, the Shihuh were difficult to govern and their principal northern villages were often secessionist, depending on the inaccessibility of the terrain they inhabited. They were frequently in conflict with the Sharqiyin of the east coast of the UAE, but would settle their differences to make common cause against the central authority represented by Sharjah when the Sharqiyin made one of their numerous attempts to shake off that yoke. The Shihuh were also frequently in conflict with the Al Qasimi of both Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah and were generally more ready to accept the Suzerainty of Muscat. However, their economic needs crossed borders and Shihuh often had property or other holdings subject to Ras Al Khaimah or Sharjah. The village of Sha'am is a good example of a territory that became economically and therefore politically dependent on Ras Al Khaimah, even though its Shihuh population originated in the Rus Al Jibal and would have been considered Omani.

Sheikh Sultan bin Salim Al Qasimi took Ras Al Khaimah to full independence from Sharjah in 1921 and was determined to maintain the integrity of the emirate, despite a number of secessionist influences. One such was keenly felt at Rams where the headman, Abdelrahman bin Saleh Al Tanaiji, concluded an alliance with the Shihuh. Sultan bin Salim made a complaint to the British Agent, which yielded no effective response, and in June 1921, fighting broke out. Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum of Dubai tried to mediate in the clash, which was disrupting the pearling season (Sultan bin Salim had augmented his fighting force by bringing in all of the available pearl divers as additional troops).

It was eventually the risk of loss to the Indian merchant community (British subjects) that led the British to take action to solve the dispute and, in July 1921, HMS *Cyclamen* arrived off Rams, where a four-month truce had already been agreed between the Shihuh and Abdelrahman's brother, Muhammad bin Saleh Al Tanaiji, the new *wali*. Abdelrahman himself was dead, murdered by his cousin, Salim. The new treaty agreed that Muhammad bin Saleh recognised the suzerainty of Sultan bin Salim and Sultan bin Salim agreed to punish the murderer of his brother. It did not last three days until the parties fell out again and a further treaty negotiation took place with the Sheikhs of the Shihuh and the President of the Muscat Council's private secretary. This time, Muhammad bin Saleh and Sultan bin Salim were both sent into custody in Sharjah but broke out and returned to Rams with a force of Shihhu where fighting once again broke out. The final treaty, signed on 22 February 1922, broke the tie between the Shihuh and Muhammad bin Saleh and endured.

The Shihuh and their historical influence over events shaped Dibba, an eastern town which is the confluence of three borders: Sharjah and Fujairah in the UAE and Oman. The *wali* of Dibba in 1855 was killed by Shihuh tribesmen. Named Mashari, the man's brother was *wali* of Ras Al Khaimah. The pattern of rivalry between the townsfolk of Dibba and the Shihuh was established and by 1871 the depredations of the Shihuh were impacting the revenues of the town. The position of *wali* at Dibba being at times made almost untenable by this rivalry, in 1926 the *wali* signed a treaty with the Shihuh which however broke down on his death in 1932. The new *wali* lost no time in appealing to Muscat for protection, hoisting the Omani flag above his fort. This led the Ruler of Sharjah, Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi II, to protest to the British, who stated that Dibba was Sharjah territory. The result has been the creation of Dibba as a Sharjah town with Oman to the north and Fujairah to the south which has, as it has expanded, become a town with three Rulers.

Likewise, the wali of Kalba was more or less dependent on Shihuh goodwill and influence and they played the role of 'king maker' on more than one occasion.

British frustration with the wide-ranging conflicts between settled populations and the Shihuh led in 1926 to a proposal to rehouse them at Kalba - and give them control of the Shamailiyah, an area which represents the whole east coast of the present UAE (including newly independent Fujairah) and therefore reduce the clashes which were taking place between Shihuh and the local populations of the villages on the north-west coast. In the end the proposal came to nothing

**Culture:** *Typical qualification that all people groups can't be summed up in small paragraphs and this is an over generalization.*

The Shihuh are fishermen and herdsmen. The land in which they live is rocky and arid with very little vegetation. Their stone houses are called bayt al qufl, which means ""cave house,"" since they are partly underground. Until about the early 1970s, the tribe was isolated from the outside world. They did not trust outsiders, and it was common for visitors at that time to have stones thrown at them by tribesmen. Nowadays, the Shihu are no longer hostile to outsiders, but neither are they particularly friendly.

Interestingly, it seems that the women might wear a fashion mask called the Battoulah

[A Shihuh woman wearing a Battoulah](https://preview.redd.it/26umxer7ksce1.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=34d6550f7eb890602a61047f837171f6ee640be5)

**Cuisine**: This is going to be just about UAE cuisine because I cannot find much about the Shihuh cuisine. Emirati cuisine is the local traditional Arabic cuisine of the United Arab Emirates. The origins of Emirati cuisine come from the Bedouins who roamed the country. Seafood has been the mainstay of the Emirati diet for centuries. Meat, fish, and rice are the staple foods of Emirati cuisine. Lamb and mutton are the more favored meats rather than goat, beef, and camel meat. Dates are usually consumed with meals. Popular beverages are coffee and tea, which can be supplemented with cardamom, saffron, or mint to give it a distinct flavor. Some major dishes include Asida, Chebab bread, Balaleet, Bathieth, Harees, Jami, Kabsa, Khabees, Khanfroush, Khamir bread, Machboos, Margouga, Maqluba, Muhala bread, Ghouzi, Salona, Tharid and Biryani.

[Tharid is a traditional Arabic stew made with vegetables and lamb or chicken. The stew is then poured over paper-thin, cracker-like regag bread that soaks up all the juices.](https://preview.redd.it/xpw6fj3jnsce1.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=49fc57251713d809d2707a5b072669ba3b9bb8f7)

# Prayer Request:

* Pray for the Lord to speak to Shihuh elders through dreams and visions of the risen savior.
* Pray for sufficient rainfall to provide for livestock and crops as a testimony of God's power and goodness.
* Pray for hearts to begin to hunger for the forgiveness of sin found only in trust in the finished work of Jesus Christ.
* Pray for the Lord to thrust out Holy Spirit-directed workers to disciple the Shihuh people in the ways of Christ.
* Pray that our hearts continue to ache to see the unreached hear the Good News.

*Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. (Romans 10:1)*

I met this girl on hinge a few weeks ago. We’ve been on 2 dates and have been texting very consistently. 

She is such a sweetheart and has a great personality. In fact, she is basically everything I’m looking for in terms of soft qualities (personality, ambition, culture, etc.) we get along great and have really good conversations, joking around, similar interests, etc. 

With that being said, I increasingly feel like her photos on hinge were a little misleading and are a few years old. For our first date I noticed this but really didn’t think anything of it because we met for coffee on a cold winter day and we were all bundled up. She has a very pretty face. On the second date I noticed more of her physical traits since we were in more of a private setting and I honestly realized I’m not as physically attracted to her as I thought/had hoped. 

I’m the type of person who really values physical/sexual attraction in a healthy relationship and not sure what to do. I genuinely enjoy spending time with her, talking to her, and see myself with her in a longer term but she made a comment of why I wasn’t trying to be more romantically physical and kiss her etc. and I guess I realized I subconsciously was reluctant to? 

I woke up today freaking out a little because I’m unsure of how to handle this. Should I give her a chance and see if maybe I’m overthinking this? Or should I let her know how I feel and end things? Part of me wants to give her a chance because I know she has a really active lifestyle right now and she went through some tough years recently, which I of all people can definitely understand. With that being said, I don’t want to waste my or anyone else’s time. 

How would I know for sure if I can move forward with her? For context we haven’t had sex yet so maybe we should and then I can reassess how I feel?",0,1736788470.0,dating_advice,5,0.5,False

Society often romanticizes this season of life, but I think that’s because hindsight is 20 20. Sure, this is the time for self-discovery and exploration, but with that comes uncertainty. For most of us, our 20s are bittersweet, but the bitterness comes from dating.

Your 20s are probably the last time in adulthood when your mistakes won’t derail your life. I’m sorry to be so gloomy, but it’s the truth. You probably don’t have a mortgage to pay yet and aren’t in a super demanding leadership position in your career. I’m guessing you don’t have a spouse or children, or you wouldn’t be on this website! My point is that you don’t carry the heaviest of life’s burdens yet, for better or for worse. With all of that freedom comes options, and sometimes, *too many* options. Trying to find a partner in your 20s can feel like finding a needle in a haystack because your peers aren’t looking for anything serious.

I spent half of my 20s in a career I loathed, and the other half bootstrapping a business, so I deeply understand how hard it is to date in your 20s. While you’re busy trying to figure out your life, everyone else is sowing wild oats. It can make finding a partner on the same page as you feel like a lost cause. These issues aside, there’s a reason why so many older folks think fondly of their 20s. Dating in your 20s *can* be rewarding if you stay true to your values and approach relationships with intention. In my guide, I’ll show go over the biggest roadblocks you’ll face dating in your 20s, and share my best tips for how to find love amidst the chaos and unpredictability.

 

# Challenges of Dating in Your 20s

I wish I could give you one simple reason why learning how to start dating in your 20s is so challenging. Really, it’s a mix of inexperience and uncertainty, which I’ll dive into next, but first, I want to share my overall perspective. Navigating love in this season of your life is probably the hardest it will ever be. That should give you hope for the future, but I know it doesn’t solve the issues at hand. What I can promise you is that with time, your vision for life becomes clearer, and you’ll find who you are and who you’re supposed to be with.

 

# No Prior Relationship Experience

By the time you’ve reached your 20s, you’ve probably had your first kiss or been on a movie date with someone. You might have even called someone your boyfriend or girlfriend. That said, teenage romances don’t count as *real* adult relationships. Adult relationships are deeply fulfilling, but are usually less passionate than teenage crushes. In your teens, you might like someone because they share your taste in music or because you think they’re cute. [Creating a spark with someone special](https://lumasearch.com/blog/the-science-of-creating-a-spark-with-someone-special-2/) is admittedly easier in your 20s. Adult relationships are still based on mutual attraction, but they’re built on more solid foundation, like financial stability, dependability, loyalty, and communication.

I doubt that many people in their early 20s have shared a home, a pet, or a mortgage with partner, and these responsibilities add layers of nuance to relationships. The more responsibilities you share with a partner, the more important communication skills, setting and respecting boundaries, and fairly settling arguments are because there’s more hinging on the longevity of the relationship.

In your 20s, you probably don’t know how to build a solid foundation for a relationship because you’ve never done it before! You might not even know how to go about [asking someone out](https://lumasearch.com/blog/how-to-ask-someone-out-without-coming-off-creepy/) without coming off creepy or desperate. Being inexperienced is something to be ashamed of; in many ways, it’s better to know nothing than to know the wrong information. I know the dating scene feels like a minefield for someone who doesn’t already know how to navigate it, but with time and more dating experience, relationships will start to feel more natural.

 

# Hookup Culture and “Situationships”

Hookup culture is like a door-to-door salesperson; it shows uninvited, takes up a ton of your time, and you end up buying something you don’t like out of politeness. Seriously, hookup culture is so pervasive in the US that you don’t need to live in a major metropolitan area for it to be part of your local dating scene. In my experience as a dating coach and [Matchmaker](https://lumasearch.com/matchmaker/), I’ve found that most people don’t actually *want* casual flings! They’re just looking for real love in all the wrong places.

Hookup culture is so intrinsically tied to dating in your 20s, it’s nearly the standard. Situationships and one-off hookups are more normalized than committed partnerships for 20-somethings, which makes it incredibly difficult to find other singles in your age group who have the same relationship goals. Listen, if you *are* looking for hookups, no one is judging you! Now is the time for exploration, including in romance. But not every 20-something wants casual flings, and those that seek commitment and partnership are truly in the minority.

Peer pressure and social norms often convince 20-somethings to give into hookup culture, even if that’s not what they really want. This only further isolates relationship-minded singles from the dating scene, and often does more harm than good. If you’re a 20-something who wants a serious relationship, you have to stand your ground. Going against your values and crossing your own boundaries will never serve you in the long run. Over time, going with the flow of hookup culture when you don’t really want to is going to eat away at your self-esteem and make it harder to trust future partners. It’s better to be the black sheep than to end up becoming something that you don’t want to be.

 

# Uncertainty About Goals and Values

Is there anything more polarizing than uncertainty? Some of us thrive in it while others drowned in it. Personally, I love uncertainty: it drives knowledge, understanding, growth, and transformation. There’s no greater time of uncertainty than your 20s: you’re probably still mapping out your career path, deciding where you’d like to live long-term, and figuring out your life-long hobbies, passions, and friends. You might not know who you are and what you want out of life. One day, you think you have it all figured out, but everything changes by the next. Having a lack of clarity and trajectory for your life means that you can’t be sure about much, let alone who your ideal partner is.

If you don’t know whether you want to get an RV and be a digital nomad or buy a house, get married, and have kids, there’s really no way you can find the right person for you. Until you zero in on the lifestyle you want, you’ll end up going through a lot of heartache in the dating scene. Uncertainly about your life goals is going to lead to mismatched expectations in relationships. When you first start seeing someone, you might *think* you two share similar visions for the future! But three months in, your mind may change, and now your goals are going to take you and your partner in opposite directions.

The worst part is that everyone has a different idea of what dating in your 20s should look like, which only adds to the uncertainty. Your parents might think it’s best if you settle down early and get married, while you friends are encouraging you to be more carefree. Your loved ones are probably pulling you in 1,000 different directions, and these conflicting opinions can make you feel even more confused about what you really want. My best advice? Don’t listen to opinions from people you don’t really respect, and take the time to really figure out what you want out of life before diving head first into the dating scene.

 

# Financial Instability

For most people in their 20s, financial stability feels like a far-off dream rather than a near future. You know the stereotype: late nights at the office fueled by ramen noodles and instant coffee. Trust me, I get it! When I was in my 20s, I thought I had it all figured out as a corporate finance and process improvement consultant. Just a few years in, I realized my career wasn’t truly fulfilling, so I turned my finances upside down self-funded my Matchmaking company. So I know a thing or two about financial instability!

By your mid to late 20s, you’re probably still in early-level positions if you even have narrowed down your career. Low salaries paired with student loans, the insane cost of living, and simply affording groceries can make going on dates out of reach. It doesn’t help that the dating scene is superficial right now, either, and cares more about the cost of the date than the quality of the time you spent together. Not *everyone* is that callous, but society as a whole puts more emphasis on shallow luxuries than real connection.

With dating feeling more like a pay-to-play game than a journey to a lasting relationship, tons of 20-something singles are opting out of romance entirely. All of the recent statistics on marriages, birth rates, and dating trends show that people are settling down later in life, and the biggest reason is that life is expensive enough without a mortgage, spouse, and children. That said, dating in your 20s can still be fun and fulfilling, you just have to go out with the right people. Focus on attracting a partner who’s in a similar financial position as you or who doesn’t equate your wealth with your value as a person.

 

# How to Start Dating in Your 20s

Dating in your 20s might feel like walking on eggshells, but shifting your mindset and incorporating these tips is going to make your experience much more fulfilling. Just about all of my 20-something clients joined my Matchmaking service with the wrong mindset about how find love, so don’t worry if you feel a little lost right now! I’ll help you find the balance between looking for love and staying true to yourself.

 

# Be Clear on Your Intentions

Dating in your 20s is bound to be overwhelming if you aren’t sure what you want. Before you dive headfirst into the dating scene, decide what kind of relationship you’re even looking for. Are you ready for a serious, committed partnership, or do you just want to have casual flings? Once you do some soul-searching and find your answer, you should be upfront and honest with any love interests about your relationship goals. No one likes to be strung along, so treat others as you’d like to be treated! No matter what kind of connections you’re looking for, trust is the basis for any type of relationship. Being direct about your intentions is a win-win; you save time and energy, and the other person doesn’t end up with hurt feelings!

 

# Stop Looking For Perfection

I recently had a 20-something client who wanted a woman who was ready to settle down and have children immediately, but was also hyper-independent and had accrued her own wealth. Did you catch the irony? The truth is that “perfection” does not exist. There’s probably not a single person who ticks off all the boxes on your list, and that’s okay! What’s important is that you find someone who aligns with you on big-picture ideals, like your values, goals, and lifestyle. As for my previous client, I guided him through date coaching to help him determine what he *really* wanted from a partner before we started the match search. After some soul searching, it was clear that what he really wanted was a loving, nurturing partner, and he’s happily married to a stay-at-home-mom to this day!

 

# Don’t Rush Commitment

If you’re in your late 20s, I’m sure you’re already receiving a flood of wedding and baby shower invitations. Your friends mean well, but I know that watching everyone around you couple up and settle down can put pressure on you to do the same. I can promise you that love doesn’t adhere to a timeline; it doesn’t care that your friends are getting married, it will find you once you’re ready for it! If you’re a hopeless romantic and you *love* love, my best advice to you is to let relationships progress at their own pace instead of making [the biggest dating mistakes](https://lumasearch.com/blog/the-4-biggest-dating-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them/). Rushing into a new relationship can make you blind to red flags, which causes more harm than good in the long run. Taking your time getting to know potential partners will give you a stronger foundation for the future than hurrying through the early stages of dating.

 

# Set Boundaries Early

Nearly all of my 20-something clients have the same issue: they can’t set fair boundaries. Some people think that even the most reasonable boundaries will push potential partners away, and others are way too aggressive about it. There seems to be no happy medium for boundary setting. Having been a Matchmaker for over 2 decades, I can tell you that healthy boundaries are a non-negotiable in dating and relationships. They’re what separates healthy from toxic. You just have to approach any conversation about boundaries from a loving, empathic perspective. Plus, honing this skill is going to set you up for success in your career and other relationships, too!

 

# Plan Affordable Dates

Dating in your 20s doesn’t have to break the bank! This season of your life is likely when you’ll have the least amount of pressure to take your date out to upscale lounges and 5-star restaurants. If you’re single in your 30s and 40s, that’s when you’ll really be expected to shell out hundreds of dollars for a date, so now’s the time to enjoy creative, low-cost date ideas. If you’re on a tight budget, try taking your love interest on a sunset picnic on the beach or at a park. This is so romantic, but also doesn’t require you to empty your wallet. If your date doesn’t like an intentionally planned, low-cost date, they weren’t the right one for you, anyway!

 

# Shift Your Mindset For Dating

Dating is not some high-stakes game to be hastily won. Instead of adding pressure to your dating life and thinking every date *has* to be “the one”, have a little fun with it! One of my past clients really was the total catch; she was beautiful, successful, and emotionally mature. There was just one issue: she treated dates like job interviews. After her date with her first match, I met with her match to get his feelings on where the relationship would go. He told me that he liked her, but she made him feel like the success of their date was life or death. I helped her navigate her immediacy around relationships and set them back up after some date coaching. The rest is history, and they’re still together today!

 

# Stay True to Your Values

I had a client years back who had no trouble getting first dates, but was never asked on a second. I asked her why this could be happening, and she truly had no idea. I had her detail how her dates usually went, and I really couldn’t figure out why she kept getting ghosted, either, until she told me that she always caved into pressure and got intimate on first dates. She *said* that she was looking for a long-term relationship, but her actions were telling another story. Compromising your values is tempting in our hookup-driven dating scene, but don’t fall for it! Anyone serious about getting serious isn’t going to ask for intimacy too early, so if your dates are turning sexual too quickly, this is a huge sign that you’re going out with people only looking for casual flings.

 

# Learn How to Handle Rejection

Like it or not, rejection is a fact of life, and it’s something you’ll have to get used to in the dating scene. No one *wants* to be rejected, but the truth is that the more you put yourself out there, the more you’ll have to face being let down. That said, rejection isn’t usually a personal attack on your character or appearance! Think about it like this: over half of the US population is already in a relationship. Even if you’re objectively attractive, you’re still going to get rejected about 50% of the time! Just because you’re going to be rejected at some point isn’t an excuse to stop dating altogether, though. The more you try, the closer you get to success, and each stumble is an opportunity for personal growth.

 

# Invest in Your Personal Growth

Here’s the thing no one tells you about dating in your 20s: *you* are your biggest limiting factor. In this season of your life, there are more open doors for you than there might ever be again. Once you reach your 30s and 40s, you’ll have less time to explore your personality and self-expand. Right now, you should be focusing on cultivating your passions, mastering your hobbies, developing your career, and making life-long friends just as much as you should be looking for love. Investing in yourself isn’t just going to help you build your dream life, it’ll help you attract your best possible partner. Plus, the more workshops, conferences, and social mixers you attend, the greater your chances are of meeting other singles like you!

 

# Be Patient With Yourself

I’ve saved the best for last! Learning how to start dating in your 20s is a process of trial, error, and growth, and it’s crucial to be patient with yourself along the way. Not every connection is going to work out, and that’s okay! Sometimes, the rug will be pulled from underneath your feet. Life is a series of ups, downs, and everything in between, but you have to trust that what’s meant for you will find its way to you. Your life partner will find you exactly when they’re supposed to, and unfortunately, no sooner than that. All you can do is to keep moving forward and learn from each setback. Focus on progress, not perfection in dating, and even if it takes a while to meet your perfect match, you’ll still have fun on the journey.

 

# Why 20-Somethings Choose Matchmakers

When people think of Matchmakers, they usually imagine that their clients are 40, 50, or even 60. Contrary to popular belief, about a third of my clients are 20-somethings! Most of my younger clients join my firm because they don’t even know where to begin looking for the right partner. They’re overwhelmed in the hookup-driven dating scene. They know they want commitment, but they don’t know where to find it. Matchmakers veer away from algorithms and casual flings; they hand-select each match and only take on clients who are looking for a serious, lasting relationship.

Matchmakers provide expert guidance and support for their younger clients with date coaching, post-date feedback sessions, and even wardrobe consultations. At LUMA, we have Matchmakers specifically trained to help 20-somethings find lasting love and committed partnerships.

I've been diving into the research on green tea lately, and I wanted to share some fascinating findings while getting your experiences. Green tea (Camellia sinensis) has been used for centuries, but modern research is revealing some interesting mechanisms behind its benefits.

Key research findings:

Recent meta-analyses have shown that green tea's primary bioactive compounds (EGCG and other catechins) may contribute to:

* Metabolic support through thermogenic properties
* Antioxidant effects due to polyphenol content
* Potential cognitive benefits linked to L-theanine content

The most compelling evidence comes from a 2023 systematic review in the Journal of Nutrition, which analyzed 45 randomized controlled trials and found consistent benefits when consuming 3-5 cups daily.

I personally drink green tea both hot and cold, and I've noticed better energy levels compared to coffee - less jitters and more sustained focus. I'm curious about your experiences:

* What benefits have you noticed from regular green tea consumption?
* Do you prefer certain preparation methods?
* Has anyone tried different varieties of green tea and noticed varying effects?

I have been operating a bus for several years now. All of my experience is within the Victoria region.

**Why I am Here to Share**

Traffic and the infrastructure around it is a HUGE topic on this sub and no doubt around the kitchen tables of many homes. A lot of our municipalities are making significant changes to vital corridors and transit is a big part of those plans. There is a lot of change happening and it is very exciting. In terms of transit, there has probably never been a better time to be a part of the system, because there has never been a time when all levels of government were so aligned on expanding transit in regions across Canada.

I am here to share my experience as a bus driver and to share any questions or concerns you have about transit services in our region. I am here to talk about my experience which is why the second heading here is important.

**What I am Not Here to Talk About**

I am just a bus driver. So I cannot offer any comments on future projects or offer my personal opinions on current ones. If you ask me I will give my answer here so don't be upset when here isn't a response: I am excited to be a part of the change.

I will not give my personal opinion, but I am willing to offer my professional opinion in my role as an operator. For example, I have concerns over mixed use bus lanes like what we've seen operating down Douglas south of Tolmie Ave. My hope in sharing these concerns and talking about these items is to increase awareness for people of the perspective from our operators. Many of the things that impact transit and our drivers are determined by the individual municipalities and not BC Transit, so it is helpful for us if the public is made more aware of the impacts so that they can shape the policies within their own jurisdictions.

I also want to hear your perspective as a rider, potential transit rider or fellow road user. I want to know how our processes impact you. Perhaps you've had a weird interaction with a driver on the road and were curious why it went down a certain way, this is your time to ask. And I will answer.

Also, we've all had bad experience on the bus with a driver. I want to hear about those experience and share with you some insights from the driver perspective but situations where the driver was clearly in the wrong like closing the doors on passengers or verbally abusing people won't get comments from me. These are blatant violations of our code of conduct and the only response that is proper is reporting the driver to BC Transit.

I do not live in the world with rose coloured glasses (it would be a feat as a transit operator with what we see daily), while we have a great many wonderful and awesome drivers, there are some baddies and the only way to get them out of the system is to report the event to BC Transit. We can talk about reporting and what happens if that is something someone would like to explore.

**Legal/Work Policy Stuff**

Everything I write here is my own opinion and does not in any way reflect those of BC Transit or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. This is not an official BC Transit AMA, I am doing this on my own time for the benefit of a subreddit that I enjoy engaging and sharing with other engaged people on.

I am using an alt account because I do not want to link my normal Reddit use with that of my employer. I hope that this is not an issue.

**AMA Schedule**

I just brewed a full pot of coffee and I am ready to answer your questions until around 1 pm today. So bring it on Victoria! It's your time to ask your driver anything because right now this bus has nowhere to go...",2,1736787418.0,VictoriaBC,3,0.75,False

1i0iiik,https://youtu.be/9LFReAyOWCc?si=8icLCa16sqrNhUvq,"Study of Metagenomics, Mapping Human Microbiomes","Video on mapping the human microbiome and studying its impact on health. I thought this speaks to Dr. Hillman's bacteriological specialty. Although this video does not address ancient Greek practices directly, it illustrates through modern methods and findings that the ancient Greek approach to microbial medicine may be more sophisticated than we understood before.

Takeaways that were of interest to me are:

- The human microbiome is critical to human health.

- Adjusting the gut microbiome can significantly impact health outcomes for many conditions, including cancer risk and proliferation. Food is an important vector for incorporating microbial strains that are not already present, including foods that are not fermented. For instance, coffee was found to be a pre-biotic for certain strains of bacteria that don't thrive on any other foods, and they are still studying the potential impact of those strains on health.

- Microbiomes of rural compared to urban dwellers were vastly different, likely due to the lack of natural plant food sources and general lower complexity of the urban diet. The gut microbiome of the preserved Ötzi remains from the bronze age were a closer match to people from rural areas and hunter-gatherer societies than to urban microbiomes.

- FMT is still the most effective and comprehensive way to transfer healthy microbiome in cases of C-section births, since the womb is sterile or very near sterile with regard to microbes, and transfer of microbiome through contact with the mother's birth canal is the primary way for the child to inherit a healthy biome. There is a brief window of a few days during which the infant may still inherit the mother's biome after birth through physical contact.

- Use of antibiotics resets the gut biome, and in a small percentage of cases the biome does not recover to original potency, and new invasive strains though social and environmental exposure can take hold, which may contribute to emergence of allergies (autoimmune response) after treatment. Some conditions previously considered to be non-communicable, such as obesity, may be partially transmissible through the microbiome.

- Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors affects the microbiome by means of adjusting the pH of the system.

- Co-habitation may adjust the microbiomes of everyone in the household, but it is mostly limited to oral microbiome. The microbiomes of cohabitants overall may be shared up to 20%, but the oral microbiome may adjust to sync up to 50%. The adjustment is mostly an additive effect between persons of disparate microbiomes prior to co-habitation.

- Auto-brewery syndrome, a rare condition of certain microbes proliferating in the gut that convert food to alcohol, may produce a positive result on alcohol tests administered by law enforcement.

1i0iie7,https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity_protocol/comments/1i0iie7/whys_everyone_talking_about_olive_oil_and_cocoa/,why's everyone talking about olive oil and cocoa as a superfood for longevity?,"**TL;DR:** If you want to fight aging and feel better, load up on antioxidants and polyphenols. EVOO and cacao are two of the easiest (and tastiest) ways to start.

Bryan Johnson’s Don’t Die doc has everyone talking Longevity again. 

Turns out, high-polyphenol foods like cocoa and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) are legit superstars when it comes to high antioxidants and polyphenol ingredients. 

Polyphenols = antioxidants = longevity.

Here’s why it works:

\- Protects against free radicals  
\-  Reduces oxidative stress  
\- Fights the effects of aging

Found in:

\- Berries  
\- Nuts   
\- Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)  
\- Raw Cacao  
\- Green tea   
\- Dark leafy greens   
\- Turmeric  
\- cinnamon  
\- Pomegranates  
\- Beans   
\- Lentils  
\- Avocados 

Antioxidants are like cleanup crews for your cells, fixing damage caused by free radicals. 

Polyphenols (a specific type of antioxidant found in plants) take it even further—they help:

\- reduce inflammation,  
\- improve cholesterol  
\- even keep blood sugar levels in check.   
\- amazing for skin too: fewer wrinkles, better elasticity, and more glow.

When it comes to finding ingredients rich in polyphenols, convenient and affordable to take daily there is a consensus around 2 ingredients within the list shared above.

**EVOO + Cacao.**

But how you should source them?

**EVOO:** 

* cold-pressed, 
* high-polyphenol olive oil (anything over 500 mg/kg is considered great).
* check the harvest date and aim for oils bottled within the last year (eg: this year = harvest 2025 = sept/nov/dec 2024)
* High oleic acid content (over 76%)
* Packaged in UV-protectant glass bottles, safeguarding its nutritional potency for longer durations.
*  I’ve started using a high-polyphenol olive oil and undutched cocoa powder with over 400 mg of flavanols per serving, and they’re honestly game-changers

**Cacao:** 

**The darker, the better.** 

* Go for minimally processed - ideally 100% undutched (retains natural acidity and full nutrient profile for maximum health benefits.)
* Look at the high flavanol content. Aim for something like 400 mg per serving
* Avoid sugary stuff 
* Avoid overly processed cacao - that kills most of the antioxidants.
* tested for heavy metals 

I’ve started using high-polyphenol olive oil (813 mg/kg) and undutched cocoa powder with over 400 mg of flavanols per serving, and they’re honestly game-changers. 

\- EVOO: 1 tbsp (20ml) before meal + 10 ml with my meal

\- Cacao: 20g with milk + collagen + coffee. Tbh, I love taking it.

1i0iic1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i0iic1/aita_or_family_drama_llama/,AITA or Family Drama Llama,"Honesty I never thought I would be writing an update to my daughters wedding drama, but the drama continues 6 months later. though technically it is Family Drama Llama - so part of this is that my marriage is bi-racial and I bring that up because my SIL has always be hostile to me. In contrast my MIL is a wonderful woman and I have NEVER felt unwelcome or unwanted in her home. 

For a short recap: My MIL (85F) and SIL(69F) convinced me to hold my daughter's wedding at a local chain restrauant because the couple had thier first date there, that turned out to be a lie. so what the bride didn't care. But the part that my daughter didn't know was that her aunt, my SIL ran up the reception bill by over ordering and charging it to my credit card. NOT COOL. the contract price went from 590 for 20 meals with drinks, to 897. but that was ok, still not horrible and my daughter had a wonderful day. But the AUDACITY!! even after I had told her not to order anything more. I have to add this because I've been obssessing since this last episode (which I will get to). We had a contract for 20 meals, In total we had 13, including the Bride and Groom. (I didn't eat because i was running around all day.) so Day Of, the manager of the restrauant said no worries, they would subtract unordered meals from the total. Awesome!!! Now here is how the meals broke down; 7 unused meals (A), My grandson in a weight lifter - heavy lifter, so he asked if he could get a second plate. ABSOLUTELY: My grandson must be fed (7-1=6), (B) We have two older aunts who could not attend and I asked my MIL's sister to please take them each a plate. (6-2=4}, That left four meals that we would get taken off the bill.  Right after I confirm this with the manage of the restaraunt, SIL comes to where I am (finally) getting to sit for a moment and then this:

SIL ""the way I count you have about 7 or 8 meals uneaten, right"" OP ""well, no we are taking the discount on the bill""  SIL ""so there are 7, because your grandson ordered a second plate.""  OP ""yeah, he's my grandson so yeah, heavy lifitng requires extra calories""

SIL ""ok, so we can order 7 more meals""  OP ""NO, no that is not what I said. I sent meals home for tha Aunties. SOOOO There are only 4 meals unordered, we are taking them off the bill. so no, there are NO meals left, none, no""   SIL "" ok well, we're going to order 7 more""   OP ""no, who is ""we"", ""we"" aren't ordering anything else. It's time to cut the cake. and again, ""WE' are taking those 4 meals off.""

SIL didn't listen to me, pretended not to hear me. Went to the restaraunt staff and ordered 7 (seven, fudgy seven). So I paid the bill on my credit card (mine not a joint account, not my husband's. father of the bride had to take care of the bar bill and tip out the staff. So I got a really good feel for how my SIL works and I'm not being taken advantage of by this woman again. Now everyone should be up to date. 

So a little back story: Here is a view into my past relationship with SIL. She is a half sister. She is estranged to my husband. She has never been to our home. She doesn't write, however she does talk to her brother (mi esposo) occassionally. Usually if she needs something. She is always nasty to me, I've been married to her brother for 40 yrs, and she has only been nice if her mom was in the room. I swear that in the family pictures of SIL as a child, she was miserable. She didn't smile in one single picture. I've told my husband that it looks like she was angry and miserable. He told me that, pretty much, summed up her childhood. She was miserable and tried to make everyone else miserable too. And guess what she's moving into Mom's with her. My first thought was poor MIL.

In contrast, MIL is a wonderful and dear person. In my life I have been lucky to have such a good person as a MIL. When my mom passed away MIL told me, it's ok I'll be your mom. So the issues that have cropped up aren't with MIL, but she is leaning into this thing with her daughter. My SIL moved in with my MIL, and since then she just took over MIL's home. SIL's doing this and rearranging that, MIL seems ok with it. But I noticed what I would call bossy and controlling behavior. SIL has always been that way, but it is bothering me that she is so controling in her mom's home.

For instance, SIL is a member of a religion that doesn't celebrate - anything; not birthdays, not anniversaries, not Easter, Halloween, or Christmas. This religion also sends thier members to other countries and states and has them live off of people in those places. MIL always celebrates christmas, not this year and apparently not ever again. SIL put her foot down.  Not her home, not her say, not her right, except that she thinks because she is inherenting the house she has say. There are so many things setting off red flags.

Now I try to remain civil at least. So one day, we were having a conversation about our well and the water problems we were having. I told her that we never need a water softener system before, that our well had always given good water.(we live in the boonies) But I noticed something in our water, clogging up the faucets. It was a clear algea, That i had talked to the Dept of Water and the Ag Dept, it is a clear algea that now is in our water. I was telling SIL about it and her question immediately was ""what are we going to do about my mother's water'  I asked her why it would affect mom's water? she lives in the city and has city water. SIL goes on to tell me that we need to take care of this. There isn't anything to do, duh. her water is from the city and out water is raw straight from the ground. She was talking so entitled and what irks me is that if mom's water was affected than yeah we would do something. but she doesn't need that . It seems that my hucband and I don't need or deserve good drinking water and what gall on me that I would put in a system at our home and not mom's.  Honestly, I just couldn't, not any more. just said buh bye and hung up. Chesses, am I right? BTW the system we put in was 8k and we are on a payment plan.

That was this past summer, this fall our toilet broke. Yes, your toilet can break. Our house was built in 1979, the toilet was OLD. It quit flushing, we couldn't find replacement parts anymore. It HAD to be replaced because - toilet! and we live in a 2 bedroom bungalow, just a step up from a tiny home. so one toilet and it not working. So I measured for the new toilet, 14 inch inset. That is an OLD toilet, now they come in 10 inch or 12. so I had to special order the new toilet. I purchased the toilet and the install; we had one toilet to choose from, one, 1, -- I wanted the half ""PP"" flush, but no, one choice and thank god it was reasonably priced. all together about 1200, and the  toilet seat was extra!!! - isn't it crazy that the seat isn't included.

Suddenly SIL decided that she's going to get higher toilets and have them installed in her mom's home. and she doesn't want to do them one at a time she wants both to be replaced at the same time. (note here, it doesn't matter if you do them one at a time because you have to pay 2 installation fees. The plumber installs 2 toilets, he charges 2 installations - plus one of them is on the second floor. Yet SIL is Claiming that she wants to do it for mom, that it's for Mom's safety. Now I have never heard MIL talk about wanting high toilets, I have heard her say that she doesn't feel safe in the shower and is afraid she'll fall. And I think there should be grab bars installed ( the SIL poo-pooped that suggestion) But not the toilet thing. 

Here is how my husband presented the project to me: ""hey, my sis wants to put in taller toilets in at mom's. She asked if we could pay for one"" that is what he said and what I heard was, his sister is having the tall toilets put in and we will contribute the cost of one toilet. Sounds okay, not a bad idea. A couple of days go by and suddenly he is telling me that SIL is going to put it all on our card and she will make payments to us. AHHHHHHH HELLLLLL NAAAAHHHHHH.  that is not what i agreed to, no. Then a snow storm hits so I ask him to put this on the back burner for a minute. Then I hear him on the phone and he is looking through our filing cabinet. He comes to be with a crdtcrd statement and says that he is taking a picture of it so SIL knows what toilet to get. (my husband 0f 35 yrs is failing a bit congnitively, I try to be as patient as possible). I explain to him 1- that we had to special order our toilet for our house and SIL will need to measure the cut in at mom's. 2 - i was not going to let him send her MY credit card number. I beg your finest pardon, ABSOLUTELY NOT. This convo was on speaker w/SIL.

The last few days have been quiet. I got up early today (730) and my husband was showering and shabing and dressing like he had a date. So I asked him, knowing full well he was going to the plumber to buy unneed toilets for an ungrateful woman. He said 'kinda I'm going to meet my SISTER and mom to choose features. I said ok. I went in the kitchen and got us both coffee. I took him a cup and told him before you leave I want to explain why i'm so against this without you getting mad at me or yelling. can you just listen for a moment. OMG - this reminded me why i married this big dummy. He LISTENED to everything I told him, from the wedding situation, the water purifying system, to the toilets. I reminded him that we are paying on the water system, the car, the insurance and all our other household expenses. The last four years has been really hard on our retirement fund. We just aren't as free as we were first retired.  I also reminded him that he takes his ""allowance"" 1600 everymonth. So all the bills are coming out of my account and the savings has been depleted because of overages. We are NOT in a financial position to take on more debt. I explained that I had done the research, that he was thinking he was paying for the porcelain but there are other charges to apply, 2 porcelains, 2 installs, 2 of everything that will come to around 2800-3000 and we need a break. He agreed and he hadn't been aware of what happened at the wedding, or the other stuff and that he would consider everything. I told him, we are no longer affluent, we aren't strugglling but it is a close thing and I would feel better if he could find the strength to put his foot down. Because the practical thing to do is to put in grab bars in both bathrooms and do one porcelain now and another later. But I'll brace myself because I know SIL will manipulate him. or try.

I have a nice south facing sun room with like 30 plants. It's not like a part of my personality but I care very much for their being here and being mine. Caring for them is a joy for me. You get it.

We had a cat that died a few years ago. To me it was sad yes but in a way it was slightly relieving that there wasn't a psychopath plant killer stepping all over us. I expressed this. I said I didn't want to replace the cat for a number of reasons. If we got a new cat there  is no way that I would be okay with declawing. I don't want it destroying our nice furniture we've worked hard for. I don't want it pissing in my plants. I don't want their shitty paws walking on my counters or the cutting board.

Years of fending off getting a cat. ""Vegpan, you know our daughters heart would be filled with so much joy if we got her a cat"" type of stuff once every couple of weeks. Recently I got my daughter to agree to a turtle and my wife agreed and when it came time to shop for the supplies for christmas again just so easy it slips out ""Vegpan, look at the price of this turtle, we should just get a cat.""

I broke inside. I can't keep defending my position like this. Clearly how I feel is not a consideration as I watched her face immediately change not even one second after I told her right there in the reptile aisle to just get the F'ing cat and defeatedly walked away. Nothing I ever said mattered. 

We've had this cat two weeks and I'm about to start crying over these f'ing jade plants that I've repotted seven times. Nothing is stopping it from digging them up. Neem oil, coffee grounds, fucking hot sauce. I'm trying to keep these things alive and the cat doesn't care and I feel like my family doesn't care. This plant that I'm trying to nurture and grow and see it live past me. It's all I wanted and it's just getting destroyed bc this house just absolutely had to have a fkin cat.

My wife just doesn't understand. In high school I bought my first plant with my own money and took care of it for 15 years. I came home to her ""repotting"" it one day after the first cat peed in it. It was destroyed. A plant that I had been caring for for over half my life died within like two days of all that trauma. And it was a fking Ficus.

1i0iefa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/s/rvXS0y7SiR,Update (why is everyone catholic now),"It’s been 35 days since my last post please see original for context.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/s/rvXS0y7SiR

I decided to take the Catholics up on their offer the next time they invited me to the school gym I told them about my lack of knowledge, how my family celebrates and about my friends who became eastern orthodox in my absence. Everyone was very welcoming and they invited me to their church after school. Church has became the new meet up spot for me as everyone goes pretty much everyday not just Sunday even if it’s not for service. We spend most of our time working out, going out to eat, coffee / tea / boba, and recently a lot of bonfires. 

I like the sense of community that everyone has and they have explained away many of my concerns. While I’ve never had a problem with Christianity they’re were some things that I would have said I wasn’t crazy about but almost all of that isn’t even a belief of the Catholic Church and instead we’re just personal beliefs held by Protestants that I didn’t like. The magisterium is the main thing I like over protestantism, without scholars that spend their whole life studying the Bible IN CONTEXT of the time period everyone is left up to their own devices throwing their own beliefs into the mix and purposely misinterpreting scriptures. I’ve also been learning a lot about the papacy and “apostolic inheritance” not sure if that’s what it’s called 

My family doesn’t seem to mind too much we went to a local church that was non-denominational it was fun nothing really wrong with it just a little more concert like but nothing crazy. The only thing that bothered me is when I asked my mom why we’re not Catholic she said “because loving Jesus should be fun” I didn’t like how she basically said Catholics aren’t fun and on top of that she has never once mentioned Jesus before so I find it strange that she even has a preference. My dad is down for whatever I’m down with and said if I want to go to catholic mass with my friends he’ll join me. 

I haven’t learned much about the orthodox one person in the group is orthodox but he goes to Catholic mass with us I assume because there’s no orthodox churches near us. But they seem to be similar except for a difference in the trinity that I don’t fully understand yet. Either way I enjoy Catholicism and think I will officially convert although I don’t know the process. 

My friends hold the belief that being Catholic isn’t easy and that god isn’t a wish master that makes your life easier but actually makes the road harder. Giving into sin and doing whatever you want with little to no consequences or guilt is easy while following the path of god isn’t hard. I’m grateful that I’m getting into Catholicism now, full disclosure I struggle with masturbation and porn and I know porn is terrible for your brain and mental health and it’s true adding guilt instead of just not thinking about it is much harder but I believe this is what’s best. I think if I waited to be catholic until I am old would cause me to have more sin and more guilt and more things that I am ashamed of. I think I’m a good person morally but not living by any code or philosophy opens the door for me to hurt other or be selfish. 

I am also very slothful, I’m scrawny and never really worked out until recently and ate unhealthy without any thought, I am starting to see slight changes in my body and feel more productive, happy, and energetic. I wouldn’t want to put the body god gave me to shame so I will make the most out of my working 2 arms and 2 legs and do the most good I can do with them to make this world a better place. The stronger I am and more physically fit I am the more good I can do. 

To those who are unsure about religion look at it almost like learning a philosophy. Just like stoicism or other philosophies it’s a great way to improve your life and Jesus is the greatest philosopher ever.  I think the main problem with todays world is no one has shame anymore we are all the best and you should never shame me for anything that I do or make me feel bad and we are all perfect. But feeling bad is good. controlling your behaviours, urges, and impulses is good for you and society and admitting you’re not perfect allows you to improve.


Lastly, I want to thank everyone for helping me gain the courage to accept their offer. I think it’s hard for people to seek religion as inherently I felt like a fraud. I felt like because I wasn’t sure, that I’m not a true believer and I would be faking it. I even felt the same way about the gym that maybe I should get stronger before going otherwise I’ll look weak but how can I get stronger if I never go to the gym lol? While it’s only been 35 days I feel a sense of purpose and community I also feel as if I have a duty to uphold that I must make something good of my life and accomplish something to honour my father and I will strive to be a better person for my family friends and all those who suffer. This will most likely be my last update I hope everyone had a merry Christmas and a happy new year god bless.

This is a reading/relaxing space (no TV) but right now it’s mostly full of old, mismatched furniture that came from other rooms when we got new stuff. We finally ripped out the corner hot tub (lol) and are officially ready to redo the entire space.

What we'd like to keep: Light gray chaise lounge, timpani drum side table, all the plants. Everything else is going.

We want to keep the room bright with white walls and light-colored furniture, but how can we add some color while keeping it fresh and airy? Would a rug or pillows—or both—work best? Should we replace the curtains?

We want to add new furniture and are debating between layout options and still can't figure out where the gray chaise fits in best. Here are some of our ideas for the new furniture:

- A centered couch with 2 chairs opposite it and a coffee table in the middle
- A centered couch in front of the center window with chairs and a coffee table
- An L-shaped sectional in the corner where the hot tub used to be (but we’re not sure how to fill the rest of the space)

1i0iaxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1i0iaxe/provider_unilaterally_ceased_elvanse_prescription/,Provider unilaterally ceased Elvanse prescription without discussion - pregnancy,"As the title says. 
I am absolutely devastated. Found out I am newly pregnant. Not planned, and 10 weeks into titration (about to be transferred to shared care) I had initially asked provider about meds in pregnancy as we were hoping to start trying next year. They advised a planning appointment and that it would be a risk/benefit weigh up. 
I called to tell them I am PG and ask for a review appointment to discuss and got an emailed response saying there is no research into safety in pregnancy so I need to cease immediately and they have cancelled my upcoming review. Oh. And ‘congratulations.’ 

Meds have changed my life. I do not function without them. This is the first time in my life I am not on anti depressants, I am not binge eating myself into a coma, I am not drinking 12 coffees per day and engaging in risk behaviour. I can look after my house, pay my bills without getting into 40k of debt and can focus at work. 
But there is no discussion, no consideration, nothing. Just no more meds. 

Please, can anyone help me challenge this, is it worth challenging? I just want to be able to make an informed decision. 
I was so unwell after my son with post natal depression, pregnancy, birth and newborn nearly sent me to the brink. I was so hoping for a different experience now that I am medicated.

1i0iaa0,https://www.reddit.com/r/qelbree/comments/1i0iaa0/more_questions_about_caffeine_what_if_caffeine/, More questions about Caffeine - what if caffeine did nothing to me before Q?,"So I've done alot of reading on this subreddit about the caffeine/Qelbree interaction.. but have yet to see anyone mention that they reacted similarly to caffeine as I do before starting Qelbree so I'm having trouble gauging things. 

I am that person that can drink a pot of coffee and go right to bed. Though typically I have coffee in the morning and sometimes in the evening, or tea in the evening. I dont do caffeine in the evening every night but.... Caffeine literally does nothing to me. Doesn't disrupt my sleep, doesn't wake me up in the morning... I drink it bc I love coffee and tea, not for the stimulant effects. I'm not sure if it has an effect on my ADHD... I'm recently diagnosed at 39 and still trying to figure out what I'm doing with all this.

So I see people talking about the studies that show that qelbree makes you metabolize the caffeine slower. I suppose my question is... have any of you who reacted to caffeine like I do before stating Qelbree still found  less sleep disrutption on the drug after discontinuing caffeine? I'm currently struggling with the bad insomnia, starting week 3 of Q. I was having a hard time sleeping when taking it in the morning (but also sleepy during the day), so I switched to taking it right before bed and that made it a million times worse.

We met through the internet,one thing lead to another and we started hanging out,I liked how she smiled through her eyes and it stole my heart,we would spend a lot of time giggling and talking about the news.it was fun and I thought I had found the one.

Things didn't work out between us.(That's not the point)

I was purely a black coffee guy but when hanging out with her I would drink tea(because she liked tea)

It has been years of no contact with her but everytime I am offered tea,I politely deny,it still reminds me of her,how she laughed her guts out and how she held my hand sometimes and would hug me. It was all very beautiful  to me still.

1i0i8vw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeriodontalDisease/comments/1i0i8vw/gum_pockets_567_to_23_in_three_months/,gum pockets 5/6/7 to 2/3 in three months,"I was inspired by another user to also share a positive progress story to spread some hope because i know how terrifying the first diagnosis of perio can be.

3 months ago, my bad pockets ranged from 4-7. My front were all normal (2/3) but almost all back teeth had deeper pockets - a lot of 4mms, 10x5mm, 5x 6mm and one 7mm. My dentist did SRP on 8 teeth, i also had a normal dental cleaning (btw, i’ve been doing that every 6 months for the last 5 years, and still had issues).

Today, i had my 3-month checkup and all my pockets are 2/3, which means my perio is under control and for now, i need to continue my at-home cleaning, normal dental cleaning every 6 months, and annual control with the periodontist.

what i did: i took at-home cleaning REALLY seriously and I think it made all the difference. My routine:

* brushing twice a day, always at least 30 minutes after eating, not before to protect my enamel from acidic from the food and coffee/tea
* i use an oral-b io brush with soft head and watched a lot of videos on how to use it properly (right angles and so)
* i brush my teeth for 6 minutes - 3x30 second on each quarter - one on the top, one-one of the inner and outer sides
* after brushing, i use curaprox interdental brushes both in the morning and at night. A dental hygienist helped me find the right brushes - they need to be thick enough to get all stuff out, but not too thick they can’t go through properly. I use three different sizes of curaprox interdental brushes on different teeth.
* after the interdental brushes, i also floss.

I don’t use mouthwash, just very rarely as in the past, it caused me issues with my oral pH and dried my mouth. After lunch and if I eat something during the day, I rinse with water and maybe pick out bigger food particles with a floss or interdental brush.

I don’t use xilit, i bought 2kg of it when i started this journey but ended up not using because it’s not good to rinse after brushing (as it cleans off toothpaste) and so I usually couldn’t fit it into my schedule.

I try to keep my mouth hydrated as dryness can strengthen bacteria.

The only thing my dentist today said i could improve is clean better at the back teeth at the gum line with a single tuft cleanbrush (e.g. curaprox CS 1006).

To sum it up, for me upgrading my at-home cleaning routine made a big difference. I always thought i brushed enough because I did, but my technique was properly not optimal. At the beginning, i bought plaque disclosing dental tablets to see where i didn’t brush properly and tried to pay special attention to those areas. I know this may not solve all problems and perio can be caused by a lot of things not just a lack of good technique (my GERD is a major culprit in mine) but this is something i have at least a small control over.

I was just hoping to share my story and maybe get some insight on a few questions. 

Starting around this September 2024 just a few months ago I was having terrible night time anal itching. I thought maybe hemmoroids even though I didn't  see any and just tried to deal with it..

I was not having any severe pain and I had a normal bm a couple times a week. I've always been pretty regular once a day after my coffee type person but I had been on a diet so not going as frequently wasn't too concerning. 


 In October I had the urges to have a bm but only passing blood and pus without stool which increased to a few times a day so I convinced myself to go to the doctor. Sn. I was still having normal bm just not as frequently. I got lucky (if you want to say that) to get in the next day for a colonscopy due to a cancelation. The diagnosis was confirmed within a couple weeks when pathology results came back.

My doctor says only 4 to 5 inches of my colon is affected. 

I was put on mesalamine suppositories. Blood and pus went away immediately and it seemed to work well. Then I started getting migraines. I scanned this group and saw others had this side effect too. I quit taking it and migraines went away! But now symptoms have started back with itching, gas, and skinny stools. I'm more tired and achy too. The doctor mentioned proctofoam or hydrocortisone but that they might not be covered and said to return to mesalamine for now. 

Has anyone had mesalimine headaches go away? 

Another thing I am wondering about is with onset of UC. I had started dieting and lost 30 pounds in the 6 to 7 months before UC symptoms started. Could this have caused it? 

Nobody in my family has UC. My doctor seemed very surprised (although several other autoimmune conditions in immediate family). Anyone else with no family history? 

Thank you all for reading and for sharing your own experiences. I feel so blessed that I do not have the struggles many of you have shared. I hope it will remain under control as much as possible.",2,1736786647.0,UlcerativeColitis,0,1.0,False

1i0i6lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/comments/1i0i6lr/been_signed_off_sick_now_feel_extreme_guilt/,"Been signed off sick, now feel extreme guilt.","Hi all, 

I don't really post on reddit, more of a lurker lol but I really just need to get this out my system and maybe just some re-assurance in a way because I feel dreadful. 

So I have been struggling at work for a while now, especially the past 6 months-ish. I work in social care and in the past year there have been so many changes to the way we work and financial pressures, it's like doing a different job. I used to love what I do, but now find it's all just paper work, finance panels with limited client contract, constant change and a huge workload. 

I have ADHD and definitely some autistic traits, my managers have been supportive wherever they can but I'm still finding the job extremely stressful. I get frustrated about the new ways of working, like everyone in my team. However, I do want to mention I've noticed the people who are really struggling/leaving, are also neurodivergent and saying they can't cope with the job or changes.

I have really struggled with meeting deadlines, keeping up with changes and dealing with difficult situations. I'm an anxious person and my ADHD feeds into that massively, I'm not proud to say but similarly to my personal life, I often put things off longer than I should. I get so worked up about the 'ifs and buts' of what could happen, which then gets worse and worse by leaving it until I can't face it. This has lead to me being put on an informal performance procedure and again, is something I was so incredibly ashamed of that I didn't even tell my partner until recently.

So that brings me to now, I always thought I liked my job until I realised that everything else in my life was pretty good, the reason why I'm experiencing constant anxiety and burnout is because of it, I can't live like that. I've decided I want to find another job, but I'm also scared because I have a mortgage to pay. I woke up this morning and just cried into my coffee because I can't face logging on. I've not been sleeping, I can't eat and I've started stuttering terribly, purely due to my anxiety. I called up my deputy manager and basically just cried/had a panic attack down the phone where I told her I can't work today, she told me to take today and tomorrow off work and call the doctors, I did and they have signed me off on sick for 2 weeks due to stress.

I now feel extreme guilt and I'm still stressed, just for a different reason.

1. My whole job situation, I want to find another job but I'm so burnt out, even starting a new job, I will still be exhausted, I can't just leave as I have bills to pay. I don't even want to go back to my job at this point so feel very trapped.

2. Guilt about any of my work that I haven't done this means one of my colleagues will have to pick up whilst I'm off, that has been the main thing putting me off going on sick.

3. The people I work with, I recognise it isn't fair on them either, it's the part I feel most ashamed about as to continue in a job that I can't face at this point, is going to not only impact me negative but also them.

4. The thought that people may think I'm being ignorant, there is a bit of a stigma around people who go off sick in my team and I know I shouldn't care what people think, but I would never want people to talk behind my back. Thinking I don't care etc and just taking some easy time off because I feel like I've pushed myself to this point trying to prove otherwise.

Sorry I just needed to get it out my system, if anyone has any advice or similar situations, please do share. I don't mind people being truthful, please put it in a nice way as obviously I am quite sensitive at the moment as basically, I feel like my life is going down the drain.

When planning the trip, we focused on completing some of the W trek hikes, seeing the Perito Moreno Glacier, and seeing Mt. Fitz Roy as goals. We are not very into camping, so we decided to tackle the W trek hikes as day trips from Puerto Natales.

**Overall Schedule**

Day 1: Arrived in Calafate via flight from Buenos Aires.

Day 2: Mini trekking and exploring Perito Moreno Glacier ([Minitrekking Tour Used](https://www.getyourguide.com/el-calafate-l544/el-calafate-perito-moreno-glacier-mini-hiking-experience-t233632/?utm_medium=sharing&utm_campaign=activity_details_desktop))

Day 3: Drive across the border to Puerto Natales (drove from Calafate to Esperanza and then to PN to avoid gravel roads)

Day 4: Completed Base Torres Hike ([Group Hiking Tour](https://www.getyourguide.com/puerto-natales-l32145/puerto-natales-base-of-the-towers-day-hike-t419260/?utm_medium=sharing&utm_campaign=activity_details_desktop))

Day 5: Completed French Valley Hike (we did this on our own)

Day 6: Weather prevented us from seeing Grey Glacier, so we used it as a rest day and saw the Mylodon Cave, Laguna Sofia, and Last Hope Gin Distillery

Day 7: Drove to El Chalten (from PN, border, Esperanza, to El Chalten)

Day 8: Completed Fitz Roy/Laguna de los Tres hike and drove to Calafate

Day 9: Departed

We felt the overall pace was manageable, and we saw almost everything we set out to see, which was very lucky in part with timing and the weather.

**Transportation**:

For flights in the country, we used Fly Bondi: I would recommend NOT using them ever. If you can fly anything else, then please do so. For our two flights with them, they changed the date and time without telling us, which we had to fix by talking to their representative at the airport (calling them is almost impossible). For the second, they changed the time to later in the day. They are overall unreliable and are currently being sued for their practices. Just avoid

For the car, we used ServiCar in Calafate. Overall had a great experience with them as it's challenging to find a car rental place with automatic cars. They can provide a shuttle from the airport to their office in Calafate for 30K pesos, but we just used a taxi, which was 39K. You have to arrange this shuttle ahead of time. If you plan to spend a lot of time in Torres del Paine, then I would recommend getting an SUV or something that can handle a lot of gravel roads.

For French Valley: We used the catamaran from Pudeto to get to the trailhead for the French Valley, which you should book ahead of time if you can ([Pudeto Catamaran](https://catamaranpehoe.com/))

**Tours:**

We used get your guide to book our two tours and both went very smoothly. The Perito Moreno Glacier walking was amazing and although expensive we thought it was worth the money for the experience. We initially were going to do base torres ourselves but thought a guide may be good for transport and to get a lay of the land and we're glad we did it.

**Food:**

We had some highlights on the trip in certain spots:

Calafate: Rancho Aparte (cool intimate experience)

Puerto Natales: We liked Mesita Grande > Pizzeria Napoli. Also great were Le Brisket and El Asador Patagonico. Holaste had great coffee.

Chalten: Parilla La Oveja Negra (service was meh, but food was great)

**Lodging**

Calafate we stayed at Glaciares which was not that great. Rincon del Calafate was great

Puerto Natales we stayed at Hotel Big Sur which was really great for us

Chalten we stayed in Pudu Lodge which was great

**Tips**

1. I used the free trial on AllTrails to track my hikes and keep a map in case the routes were not clear since you can download them ahead of time.
2. Use windguru as you get closer to time you're hiking for the most accurate weather. If you see cloud cover over 60-70% then you're unlikely to see the towers or fitz roy but remember that any can change instantly in Patagonia. For us this was very accurate on the days we went.  [Base Torres Wind Guru](https://www.windguru.cz/363792). [Laguna de Los Tres](https://www.windguru.cz/408847).
3. If you're tired and want to see Grey Glacier up close you can do this ferry from Hotel Lago Grey [Grey Glacier Ferry](https://www.lagogrey.com/en/navigation/). It was booked when we tried to do it.
4. For the Pudeto catamaran you can also show up even if you don't have a ticket or are on the waitlist and they will try to get your on the boat if there is space, we did that to come back earlier after we finished the French Valley hike since the tickets were all sold out and didn't have a problem.
5. Take more water than you think you need. There are streams that are potable in the parks but make sure you ask people.
6. Horseflies were annoying coming back on the Fitz Roy hike but no one got bit since we used long sleeves, pants, and bug spray. We started the hike early (5:30), no one checked tickets on the way in or out, less crowds, and less flies, overall better experience. If you can would highly recommend setting up a taxi and taking it to Rio Electrico and do the hike as a one way rather than in and out from town, much more gradual incline on the way up before you get to the very high incline towards the top.
7. Everywhere we went they accepted credit card. For times that they didn't (such as tip at selected places) we had USD which they accepted, keep some small bills with you (5s and 10s). 

These are probably the biggest things that I thought might be helpful. If anyone has questions feel free to comment or message, would be happy to answer! Good luck on your trips!

So this is not super serious but it still got me thinking. 

In the discussion I mentioned that when I will be organising my wedding, I would not be adding a registry but will be asking guests for money instead. 

My friend was taken aback and said it was extremely rude and tacky. I was kinda surprised and explained my reasoning. 

*I don't expect* people to give me money and I would never track if they have or not, but I plan to have a donnation box at the wedding, and a donnation button on the website, saying something along the lines of: ""*We don't need gifts, but if you would like to support us and cellebrate our love, feel free to help us pay for our dream wedding*"" with maybe sub categories where people can donnate specifically to help pay for the photographer and/or venue/food/ decoration etc and where they see how much has been put in each categories. 

My partner and I have been together for 3 years at this time, and we already own an apartment. I don't need furniture, coffee machine or any thing like that. Therefore I see no points in asking for gifts. However, a wedding is expensive, and while we are confortable, I though that having some of the cost offsets by guests would be nice. 

My friend re-iterated that it was tacky. So I guess I am second guessing myself as I thought it would be fine.

1i0i15o,https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1i0i15o/week_1_recap/,Week 1 Recap ,"Hi everyone. I (32F) just finished my first week on wegovy and wanted to share my reflections. After 3 years of trying to lose weight to help get pregnant (calorie deficits, meal planning, various exercise plans) and the needle barely moving, my doctor and I decided to give a GLP1 a try. I was a little hesitant in using medication, but so far I have been pleasantly surprised by the effects. It's expensive, so I am glad to see some early results -- $1,227/month until I hit our $3k deductible then its $10/mo (Novodisk coupon won't work for me because of my high deductible plan) - grateful for our HSA.  
  
Symptoms have been minimal, some nausea & constipation. But focusing on hydration, protein, and taking fiber supplements seems to help. I am not as hungry/thinking about food throughout the day, some days I had to force myself to get my planned meal in. One thing I noticed was I do not feel as bloated and inflamed this week as I usually do. My husband thinks I have been less anxious, but I don't think that's Wegovy related. I am using the same exercise & nutrition plans my primary doctor & former dietitian recommended (free nutrition program through my work I tried). Aiming for 200-300 minutes of exercise a week, around 1,300 calories a day, and wanting to get at least 60g of protein. Starting weight is 235lb (5'4). I'd like to get to 175lb ultimately, but if I get below 200 I will be happy.   
  
Below are my stats I have been tracking as well as my meal & exercise plan from this week. I slipped up there at the weekend, so wanting to take this week to focus more on exercising & sticking to my plans.

But if I write down the things that are brought up through this medicine, I notice some of it is directly related to things that are aggressive adhd traits. 

For example I tend to notice just how fucking thirsty I am and I'm way more compelled to get water throughout the day. 

I more readily notice the coffee cups in my bedroom and grab them on the way downstairs.

I'm a bit less irritable at small frustrations. 

It doesn't seem to help executive dysfunction but I'm less critical of myself for it.

Any advice?,"As a minor/young adult, I’m tired of having to scrape through so many uneasy and slippery periods of calm at home before having to endure a big blowup from them.

It’s 99.9% verbal and emotional. Ever since the summer ACS case of 2024 and also for a lot of periods of “calm” throughout my life, any physical abuse has been put on the backseat for fear of retaliation. 

Sure, I’ve been going out to libraries and coffee shops and getting out of the house at times. But that doesn’t change the fact that I’ve still got to go home at the end of the day.

Any shelters or foster homes won’t really accept me for now, because my parents haven’t kicked me out and no physical abuse has flared up so far. 

Ever since last night, my mom has put restrictions on my usage of my phone (I’m supposed to give it to her when I come home and on the weekends, only allowed to have it when I go to school). 
But the real point is, I don’t want to go home to a place where a cycle of conflict and abuse is so present, and something like this always happens over and over again.

She also said she wants to have a word with my therapist and/or psychiatrist “because she’s been teaching me to ignore/disrespect her.”

——

**Context: I’ve developed a reflex/habit of immediately walking away from/grey rocking my mom whenever she starts to say something that could potentially trigger me/induce anxiety in me/be emotionally manipulative.**

——

Mom claims she wants to have a proper heart-to-heart with me and that I’M the bad one for walking away from her when she starts talking, but trust me, any information/confession I would say in a “heart-to-heart” would be used against me in the future and she uses those “heart-to-heart” to invalidate/talk-over/argue/minimize anything I say.
She also threatened to file a lawsuit and sue ACS for “teaching me to disrespect my parents.”
I don’t know if she’ll follow through with any of these, but all I can feel is the fear that my support network is on the line.

[https://caramelly.in/products/gaggia-espresso-evolution-coffee-machine](https://caramelly.in/products/gaggia-espresso-evolution-coffee-machine)  
Would like get some inputs.

I shortlisted these 2, because these were the ones with PID within my budget. And both have good reviews from unbiased reviewers.

For Hibrew 10A:  
1. easy availability of  accessories from their indian importers  
2. pressure guage which allows to manually pre-infuse 

against Hibrew 10A:  
1. lack of service availability in Bangalore  
2. relatively new brand ( specially combined with point #1, is a concern)  
3. non standard spec portafilter design, cannot use it later on upgrade (not a deal breaker)

  
For Gaggia Expresso  
1. Teardown videos reveal a well built machine with quality components (despite a plastic body).   
2. Service availability in Bagalore  
3. Well known brand specializing in expresso machines for a very long time

against Gaggia Expresso  
1. although 53mm 2 ear portafilter design is used by other brands like sage, accessories like bottomless portafilter is not easily available here in India.  
2. Less features compared to Hibrew 10A  
3. Not a big fan of plastic  portafiler.

  
Other small thing is the that although both have plastic grouphead, given strict food safety laws in EU, Gaggia Expresso  (which is made in Italy) might have better safer plastic. I have no data to back this. Maybe hibrew also uses good quality, no way to know.

I think my hunch might be right. 

There’s been a lot of themes connected to yachts/yachting in lyrics so I thought maybe “sea bass” would be too. Like maybe it was the name of a yacht or a nightclub at a marina or something. And I did find a yacht with that name, but I don’t think thats where the clue leads. 

I found **SYBASS - SUPERYACHT BUILDERS ASSOCIATION**. 
Located in Monaco, France. (FYI - Monaco is on the Mediterranean and very close proximity to St Tropez and Cannes)

https://sybass.org

That seems like way too much of a coincidence and I thought there might be something here so I started checking out their partners and board members. Nothing jumped out immediately till I got to the bottom of the page and saw a link to the **Superyacht Life Foundation**. In fact SYBASS says they are the “Initiator of the SLF”. Ok, let’s check this out… 

https://thesuperyachtlife.com

There’s honestly a lot of stuff to look at on this website and some of it definitely leans questionable but here’s what initially jumped out to me- Listed as a partner of SLF is **GF Entertainment**.

With direct access to the very best A-List artists, we firmly believe that we can meet and exceed your expectations. This is our job and our passion and we welcome a challenge.”

It didn’t take me long to connect Emmanuel Akintunde with Drake. https://www.visionary-mag.com/post/meet-emmanuel-akintude-the-nightlife-entrepreneur-that-worked-with-drake-and-martin-garrix

And if I reach just a bit … looking at GF Entertainments instagram, I came across this: https://www.instagram.com/share/BAGIigz5ZT
It made me think of “get your *chilly* up” and other mentions of that word on GNX. We’ve already talked about the possibility of drugs being concealed in champagne on this sub. (And I know chilli is also slang for money, but again I’m looking for breadcrumbs in layered meanings). 

I also found a post that showed GF Entertainment doing an event at **Hi Ibiza**. Hi Ibiza has been on my radar already and Drake has connections there: https://www.hiibiza.com/news/drake-surprises-black-coffee 

Hi Ibiza used to be called SPACE - a super famous club I’ve mentioned in another post about Ibiza. Hi Ibiza is also being rebranded to UNVRS. And I have to wonder if some of the mentions of aliens is supposed to also point us here. It also makes me wonder if in GNX the emphasis on “**Hi**” in the line “*Hi, have you ever been a joint and you know it?*”

So that’s where I’m at in my research on this topic but I wanted to throw it out for everyone else to look into.

He wouldn’t do it anymore, damn it. He was going to quit the very next day. March into the office, slam down his badge in the big man’s face, and say everything he should have said months ago. He was going to escape that toxic environment and apply for another police job in another city. Start anew with a conviction for justice and fairness that had been lost in the Sheriff’s Department of Lake County.

He climbed into bed and closed his eyes, weary but not tired. Rising, he settled in his soft chair in his little trailer house at the end of a large field that used to grow winter wheat but had been fallow for a decade. It was his. He’d bought it on a deal and was able to make the payments. But now he didn’t want it. He had it figured out. After quitting in the morning, he’d march right over to the real estate office and put the place up for sale. Rock bottom, get rid of it, and move on.

Hell, Billings PD was always hiring. He would move down there where nobody knew him, maybe rent a cyberpunk hovel in the vast skyscrapers of the BAT. Perhaps, if he was lucky, he’d find a girl who fancied him. One of the climate refugees who didn’t mind short men or having short children—someone who was looking for love and a dry place to sleep. Yes, in the morning, he would start over.

The snow began about 1 AM with a gust of wind that rattled the windows. He got off his chair and peered out. The flakes were broad and heavy in the faint light from his porch, obscuring everything beyond his truck parked a few yards away.

The broken guitar rested on the kitchen counter. A couple years ago, he had gained some familiarity with the instrument when he’d taken a month’s worth of lessons at a music studio on Main Street—he had no interest, so he quit. This guitar was something else. When he had snuck away from the chaos at the station, he hadn’t noticed it, but carrying it into his trailer, he perceived an unusual heft; indeed, a burden to the thing. It held an ancient quality. More than just a guitar, it bore the echoes of time. To be honest, it unnerved him.

_Tap tap tap_ came the knock—soft at first, then faster and much harder. _BAM, BAM, BAM!_

Who in hell would come way out here on a night like this? Comstock?

“Open!” a voice shouted. He got up and peered through the peephole. An old woman wrapped in a big coat stood on his porch, snow covering her long, white hair.

“Yeah, what do you want?” he shouted back. “It’s damn near 2 AM.”

“Open! You were at the concert. I need your help, now.”

He unlocked and opened the door, and she shuffled in. He had to look up; she was at least a foot taller than him.

She surveyed his home and then glanced down. “Shut the damn door and lock it,” she commanded. She shuffled in, her eyes landing on the broken guitar. She shook her head. “What a shame. It’ll have to be repaired.” She limped over to his chair and plopped down. “You got any coffee?”

“Coffee?”

“That’s right. I’m speaking English, aren’t I? I never know sometimes. I need espresso, triple shot.”

He was almost out of coffee, maybe enough for the morning. They were on his shopping list, but other things had taken priority. “I got a percolator, that’s all.”

“Shit, I guess that’ll do.”

“Listen, lady—”

“Coffee first, damn it! I’m having a hard time staying awake. Need to stay awake.”

He thought it a good idea to humor her until he could figure out what she wanted. She was obviously off her rocker. Maybe a spinner. He’d give Sue at the women’s shelter a call. She had experience in this department.

She peered at him through a mass of wrinkles as he turned on his electric kettle, pulled out the coffee fixings, and scooped two heaping spoons into the top.

“A little more. I need it strong.”

He turned the bag upside down and finished its contents.

“Sugar and cream?”

She laughed. “Do I look like I take sugar and cream?”

The machine started rumble and perk.

“So, how did you—” He was going to get to the bottom of this, but she cut him off with a shush, and stared meditatively at the squat little pot until it burped it’s last, and the dense aroma of his favorite dark roast permeated the air.

He filled a mug and handed it to her. Then poured a half in his own. There was an inkling in his mind that it was going to be a long night.

She sniffed at it, grunted, sipped slowly, and let out a long sigh. “I guess it’ll do.”

“Listen, lady. My friend works at the women’s shelter. I can give her a call and have her come and get you. Give you a warm bed for the night, at least.”

She blinked at him over her steaming cup. “The women’s shelter? I don’t think so. I’m staying here tonight.”

“You can’t stay _here_.”

“Why not?”

“Because.”

“So you don’t die,” she said matter-of-factly.

“Just what the hell? I’m not going to… die?”

She gave him an appraising look. “Yes, you are.”

“Am I then?”

“Yep, but not tonight. Not if I can help it. I need you around a little while longer.”

“Okay, I’m calling Sue. That’s her name. She’ll fix you up.”

“No, you’re not.”

“And why’s that?”

“Because there ain’t no signal.”

McGreevy looked at his phone. SEARCHING FOR SIGNAL. “What the fuck?”

“Listen, Mr. What’s your damn name anyway?”

“_Deputy_ Colin McGreevy.”

The old woman grunted. The snow had melted off her, leaving a puddle beneath the chair. “A cop, eh? You got a gun?”

“Yes, I have a _gun_.”

“You got any silver bullets?”

“What? No, I don’t have any damn silver bullets!”

“You need silver bullets to kill werewolves. Don’t you know shit?”

“Werewolves? Silver bullets? You’re off your meds. That’s it. I’m taking you to the women’s shelter. I’ll drive you myself. Sue is a real good gal. She’ll take care of you.”

She gave him a disapproving grunt. “You got security cameras on this old boat?”

“Yeah. And it shows _you_ coming into _my_ house, just for the record.”

“Good. Turn it on.”

He reluctantly turned on his television to the security channel. The yard, through the night vision of the camera, revealed his truck faintly in the heavy snow.

“So what?” he said.

“Look,” she said. “There. Look!”

He peered at the television. At first, there was only his truck and the blizzard. “I don’t see anyth—” But then he did. A figure, a man—he appeared not to be wearing clothes—emerged from the storm, stood for a second staring at his trailer, and then turned and disappeared back into the gale. “What the hell?”

“Here.” The woman reached under her coat and set a matchbox on his coffee table.

“What’s this?”

“It’s for you.” She grunted and sipped her coffee.

He picked up the matchbox and slid it open—the precious metal glinted.

“It’s a silver bullet,” she said. “Put it in your gun and get ready.”

“I’m not putting that in my gun.”

“Forty-five caliber, right?”

“Yeah. But—”

“That’s a forty-five. It works. Put it in your fucking gun.”

“I don’t just put someone’s bullet in my gun. Do you realize the liability? Where did you get this?”

“I made it. Melted down my own jewelry.”

“No.” He closed the little matchbox and placed it firmly on the coffee table.

She grunted, sipped her coffee, then reached back into her coat and withdrew a dagger with a long blade that tapered to a sharp point. She set it on the coffee table next to the matchbox.

“Suit yourself.”

McGreevy felt the goosebumps rise on his arms. His police instincts made him back up, ready to tackle her if she reached into her jacket again. She looked ancient, but she could still be dangerous, and he had no idea what else was concealed in that voluminous overcoat.

His gun was in his holster, hanging on the coat rack by the door.

“What the hell is this?” He picked up the knife. It was heavy and cold as ice.

“It’s a silver knife, Einstein. Silver kills them fastest. Cuts through the beast’s enchantment.”

“Do you have a gun on you?” he asked.

“Not my style. This coffee is shit.” She sipped and watched the television.

“Who the hell are you?”

“These days, they call me White Owl. There it is again.” She pointed at the TV. “And it’s got a friend. That’s what I was afraid of.”

Now, he could faintly make out two figures standing in the storm on either side of his truck. The picture flickered, turned to static, and went black.

“If we’re lucky, there’s only two. You’re not so big. Maybe they think that’s all it’ll take.”

“All what will take?”

“To kill you and get the guitar. The reek of it wasn’t hard to follow.”

“White Owl? You know Builds A Fire? Dr. Smith mentioned you.”

She stood, towering over him. “That shrink has his own battle tonight. Everyone who was at the concert has their own battle tonight.” She held out her hand for the dagger.

Reluctantly, he gave it to her.

Before he could react, she had slid the blade across her hand. The blood formed a puddle in her palm, dripping onto the floor.

“Holy shit!”

She waddled to the door, said a word he could not make out, and pressed a bloody handprint on the white paint.

“Jesus, lady, you’re crazy.”

“Did you hear the music?”

“The music? You mean the concert? Francis?”

“Did you feel the rain? Did it run into your eyes and into your mouth?”

“Yeah, but—”

“Then it’s forever in your brain. Prepare to fight, Maji.”

“Maji?”

_BAAAM!_ The entire trailer shook.

“We must kill them and burn their bodies.”

She hobbled over to the sofa, pressed her hand against the wall, then went over to the other wall to do the same, leaving a third bloody print.

“I ain’t killing anyone,” he said.

“Yes. You are. Or they will kill you. And for this to work, I need Dr. Smith alive. That means I need _you_ alive.”

McGreevy went for his gun. “I’m going out there.”

“You are? Tell me how that goes.”

McGreevy loaded a clip into his sidearm, unlocked the door, and pushed it open.

“Headshot,” she shouted after him, “you might have a chance.”

The snow blasted his face. Out by the truck, in the little halo of the porch light, a tall man stood in the snow, naked.

“Hey, hey you!” McGreevy shouted.

The man looked at him as if he’d been startled. He opened his mouth and came forward, his flesh turning black, now covered in hair, his face distorted—he let forth a growl that filled the night. Then, he started to run directly at McGreevy.

“Shit. Stop! I’ll shoot!”

The man did not stop.

_BAM!_ McGreevy fired into his chest.

He stumbled, and howled in rage but still did not stop.

He aimed for its legs and let off two more rounds. _BAM BAM._ Direct hits.

The man jumped, shattering the wooden rail of the porch when he hit it. McGreevy tripped on the threshold and fell back hard on his ass, the creature coming down on top, crushing him, rancid breath steaming in the snowstorm, razor-sharp fangs going for his throat, his gun spinning back somewhere inside the trailer house.

From over his head, he saw the dagger in the woman’s hand. She plunged it into the monster’s eye and twisted it in a circle with a sickening slurp and cracking of bone.

An inhuman scream pierced his ears. The beast snarled and thrashed its head, then slumped and was still, its mass covering McGreevy.

“Get it off!” he shouted. “Get it off!”

She shoved the animal off him and down the steps. With strength belying her age and frailty, she pulled him inside and slammed the door behind them.

“There’s at least one more out there. We can’t let it return to the pack. It needs to die.”

“Christ! Holy fuck!”

“Yeah, they’re nasty things.” She wiped the blade on her jacket.

The lights flickered, and they were plunged into darkness.

Over the last few months I've had to become a tea person -- full-strength coffee is now way too much for me, and I've down-graded to half-caf or decaf because I still enjoy the comfort of it after something like 20 years of drinking dark roast coffee. However, I've also gotten really into buying a LOT of different teas (mostly puerhs) that I do enjoy, but I've also realized I've completely obliterated my tastebuds after so long drinking strong coffee.

I want to choose her but I do not know what is the solution? ,"For some background, I was born and raised in Vietnam but moved to the US for college, and I've been working here since. I usually visit Vietnam every 1 to 1.5 years. In the summer of 2022, I met this girl, and our love story unfolded like something out of a movie.

I first met her in summer 2022 while on a trip with my friends. Here I had a ball to go up to her at a coffee shop to ask for her phone number. We went on our first date a few days after and it was an instant hit. We had sex that night and I was her first. We then went on a vacation trip together and it was nothing short of amazing. We fell in love. She then visited me for a week before I went back to the US. This whole relationship happens in a span of 2 months when I was in Vietnam. We kept texting for a month after I returned to the US, but despite our love, I decided to break up. I wasn't ready for a long-distance relationship, and her background also played a part in my decision, though it had nothing to do with her personality. Her parents are divorced; her mom is a stay-at-home mom while her dad works at a port. Her family is likely middle-class, while my family is considered elite in Vietnam. My education and career have always aligned with elite schools and now an investment firm in the US, while she attended normal schools and works in an airline as a check-in person. Living in the US for 9 years has shifted my values, and I no longer prioritize background as much. However, in Asia, there's pressure to date or marry someone from a similar background, and my mom was against the relationship. These factors, along with the challenge of long-distance, influenced my decision to break up with her in 2022.

Fast forward 2.5 years later, I visited Vietnam again. After experiencing some situationships but not a serious relationship, I contemplated reconnecting with her. I could sense from her Instagram posts that she was still deeply in love with me. Eventually, I reached out, and we met up again, repeating the same activities we enjoyed 2.5 years ago—dates, a vacation, and a visit to my hometown before I flew back to the US. Being around her makes me feel incredibly happy. She told me being with me made her feel very comfortable, as if we were already married. However, the same reasons as before lingered. Despite being more open to the idea of a long-distance relationship this time, her background weighed heavily on me, and I decided to break up with her again. This decision broke both our hearts, and I believe she is more affected given her unwavering love for me. I want to give her a chance, but I'm worried about our future together, my family's opposition, and societal expectations in Vietnam about marrying within your class.

I feel absolutely horrible for rejecting someone I love and who loves me unconditionally. It makes me feel useless and weak for not being able to stand up to my family and societal pressure. I decided to let her go again, and this time, I don't think we will ever see each other again. 

I want to choose her and I want to figure out a solution here but I could not think of anything. Anyone has any advices?

1i0hpac,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i0hpac/went_full_you_mode/,"went full ""You"" mode","Well, not as creepy as dude in ""You"" but I went full detective mode and started connecting all the dots. Few days before the breakup, she went out with her friend and visited a cafe. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but it was a cafe we had talked about going together one day but never had the chance to go. The weird part was that she didn't even tell me that she visited that cafe with her friend, i only found out because she sent me a snap of the coffee she got and i could tell its from that cafe. 

Usaully, when she go out with friends she would always text me ""Oh, i am here at xxxxx with my friend"" or ""We are going to check out xxxxx"", but that day she barely even replyed to me or told me anything.

After the breakup, I noticed she was texting someone super constant and barely replying to me. I understand that she probably didn’t want to deal with me anymore, but seeing her texting this person like how she used to text me really killed me.

It was so easy to lookup that phone number and found all his info. They go to the same gym, and he also works at that cafe she went to. Then I checked her accounts and saw that she is following him on everything, LinkedIn, IG, Spotify, and YouTube. 

I really want to believe that she didn’t cheat on me. She has always been loyal and would tell me whenever someone hit on her, but a few weeks before the breakup, we had a big argument. Maybe that changed how she felt about the relationship, and this guy found a way to connect with her at the gym.

We dated and lived together for 6yrs, literally did every single thing together. She never talked to or even entertain other guys during that time, and if she did, she would always tell me. She would always text me her every move throughout the day without me even asking her to.

Now, I am wondering if there is actually something going on between them or if she just needed someone to talk to. She doesn’t have a lot of friends, so maybe the first guy who showed her attention became a distraction for her. She is a very emotional person, so I want to believe that she is not over me or ready to jump into another relationship this quick.

1i0hoho,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetPeeves/comments/1i0hoho/honestly_some_cat_people_on_reddit/,"Honestly, (some) cat people on reddit","Guys. It's OK to not like cats.

Most cat people I know irl are cool, and most people understand if you're not a fan of cats. I myself am kinda done with them after living with them for awhile (not my cat, my roommate's).

So many cat people on reddit are all, ""If you don't like cats, it means you don't respect boundaries or consent."" What?! No, I just don't like litterboxes and all the annoying habits cats have (playing with their claws, knocking things over on purpose, meowing outside doors etc) and I don't want to live like that. It's cool if other people like it, but they just aren't for me.

And, anytime you mention you aren't a fan of cats, people on here are all, ""Dogs are worse,"" even if you didn't mention dogs. First of all, that's an opinion (that I disagree with). Secondly, if your only defense of an animal is that another one is worse... you're not really helping your argument.

I don't even dislike cats, I just dislike living with them. But I dislike my roommate's cat because he claws at me when I'm just walking around, getting coffee or migraine meds in the morning. The little idiot can't seem to learn that I don't like it and my roommate doesn't care (doesn't even trim his nails because she's afraid), plus also won't tucker him out by playing with him to make sure he burns off energy. Ugh.

(Tbh, my roommate is an exception to the cool cat person thing. I'm over it all, honestly. We used to be best friends, but it's very clear that she doesn't care about me at all. I think she barely cares about her stupid cat, too, got him as an ESA but just sits on her ass playing video games all day).",1,1736785268.0,PetPeeves,31,0.53,False
1i0ho8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1i0ho8c/back_to_bothering_paper_again/,Back to bothering paper again.,"I’m Anik , a writer, poet, and playwright (basically a professional daydreamer who occasionally puts words together in a way that sounds smart). My life revolves around literature, theology, and philosophy because apparently, I thought, Why not overthink everything while also sounding pretentious? Spoiler alert: it’s both rewarding and exhausting. My brain is powered by a potent mix of ideas, existential crises, and just enough caffeine to keep me teetering on the edge of enlightenment - or a nervous breakdown, depending on the day.

I’ve been scribbling letters since I was six , mostly to my grandmother, bless her patience, and occasionally attempting to send her postcards… without stamps, naturally. (Turns out, the postal service doesn’t appreciate my creativity.) Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of forging some amazing connections, most of which I’ve had to let go. Not for dramatic reasons, mind you - just your garden-variety “it’s not you, it’s me” scenarios.

Lately, I’ve been toying with the idea of picking up the pen again, but procrastination is my middle name. Today, however, I finally decided to make good on that thought.I’m absolutely thrilled to meet you, well, not “meet” in the literal sense because, you know, letters...but close enough! And if you feel inspired to write back, I’ll be so grateful I might even send you a postcard. Don’t worry, this time I’ll remember the stamp. Probably.

When I’m not passionately arguing with myself about the meaning of life (or why tea will forever outclass coffee), you’ll find me in the kitchen, experimenting like a mad scientist who traded test tubes for spatulas. Sometimes it’s a culinary masterpiece; other times, even my dog looks concerned.

Rainy days are my love language. Give me a cup of tea, a slightly obscure book that makes me question my existence, and the sound of raindrops, and I’m in heaven. Bonus points if I can curl up in a blanket and pretend the outside world doesn’t exist. Bliss. But don’t worry, I’m not just a brooding intellectual; I’m also surprisingly fun. Like, “philosophical debates over pizza and bad puns” kind of fun.

I’m all about connecting with people, especially those who can tolerate my quirky humor and occasional deep dives into why we’re all here (or why pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity). Fair warning: I laugh way too hard at my own jokes and will absolutely judge your food seasoning skills.

In a nutshell, I’m equal parts thinker and clown, with a dash of culinary chaos. My DMs are open, so slide in like a confident penguin on ice. I promise I won’t bite , unless you offer me unseasoned food or subject me to Dad jokes gone wrong.

IGI plays a significant role in diamond grading, especially for lab-grown diamonds. However, buyers should approach IGI certifications with caution:

* Grading standards are generally looser compared to GIA, potentially leading to inflated grades and pricing.
* Less recognized in the North American market compared to GIA and AGS.
* Leader in grading lab-grown diamonds, but differences in grading can affect perceived value.
* Ethical concerns exist regarding potential inflated appraisals when used as selling tools.
* For most diamond purchases, I recommend choosing GIA or AGS certified stones for greater assurance of quality and value.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

* Consumers well-versed in diamond grading who can navigate potential inconsistencies
* Those seeking detailed certifications for finished jewelry pieces

# Who is this not for?

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Compare across certifications: If considering an IGI-certified diamond, try to find similar GIA-certified stones for comparison.
2. Focus on cut quality: Pay extra attention to cut grades, as this impacts a diamond's beauty significantly.
3. Verify lab-grown status: For lab-grown diamonds, ensure proper disclosure and labeling.

1. Consider purpose: For engagement rings or important purchases, prioritize GIA or AGS certifications.
2. Educate yourself: Understand the basics of diamond grading to make informed decisions.

# FAQ

Q: Is IGI as reliable as GIA?

A: While reputable, IGI is generally considered less strict in grading compared to GIA, potentially leading to slightly inflated grades.

A: Yes, IGI certifies both natural and lab-grown diamonds, with a particular strength in lab-grown certification.

Q: Can I trust an IGI appraisal?

A: IGI appraisals are professional but may lean towards higher valuations. It's wise to get a second opinion for insurance or resale purposes.

Q: How does IGI's grading affect resale value?

A: Diamonds with IGI certification may have lower resale value compared to GIA certified diamonds due to market perception and potential grade inflation.

Is it worth going professional line for this usage or stick with a Vertuo? If so, are there any Vertuo ones that still make decent ""espresso"" and can make 5-15 cups a day? (would never go over 15 really)

PLEASE READ TILL THE END

I’m taking a more script like approach this time. Hopefully the following scene will give you some inspiration for how we can proceed. Additionally it will clue you into what kind of character i’d prefer you to play. 

_________

In the early hours of the morning. Far earlier than anyone should be awake in my opinion (9:30am) came a pounding at the door. 

Knowing that my parents were out of town for the week I reluctantly flopped out of bed and threw on a shirt. 

Descending the stairs I rush to the front door and pull it open to find you as the source of the infuriating knocking. 

“Mrs Lynn you have got to chill out! It’s too early!” 

As you look upwards towards my green eyes you note the tall and slightly muscular build that my pyjama shirt is hanging off. My black hair unbrushed and plastered on one side of my face. 

The thoughts of being awoken last night by the shouting from my bedroom as I had yet another late night of gaming. 

Even now the sound of my voice was slightly grating on your ears. 

“Well I’m sorry Jake but some people actually get to bed at a reasonable hour.” 

You say as you practically push your way past me and into the house. Headed for the kitchen. 

As a good friend of my own mother you were well acquainted with the kitchen and the whole house really. 

I turn and follow the red headed flurry as you disappear down the hallway. Seeing you preparing some coffee as you talk at me some more. 

“You know I’ve been doing some modelling lately. I have a new client that has made a sort of unusual request. I was hoping that you could help me Jay.” 

I sit down on one of the bar stools. My brain still barely awake. Staring not only at your busty 5’10” frame but also rather lustfully at the coffee cup in your hand. 

“Huh? I don’t know anything about fashion Mrs Lynn” 

You pause for a moment. Trying not to get frustrated at your neighbours son. Jake can be tiresome and rather lazy. 

“Yes I’m aware.” Shooting a steely glare at my pyjamas that I deemed acceptable to open the door wearing. 

“However this client wants me to model a popular character that I think you’re familiar with. You play Dungeons and Dragons right? Do you know critical role?” 

At the mention of D&D I perk up a bit. Now far more curious about what this will be. 


——————

A nice 70% story / 30% smut ratio. The build up of our character’s relationship is the main focus. 

Experienced role players only! Looking to make this a long term Cheating / Seduction RP. I only RP in first person. 

If you think you could find a reference pic for Jake I’d love that! Finding male references is so tricky. 

Your character 

Name: _____ Lynn
Age: 35-45 
Relationship status: married 
Kids: 2
Height: 5’8-6’
Body type: hourglass figure. Redhead Slim stomach but curvy hips, ass and tits.

Thank you so much for making it this far! I’ve tried not to be too restrictive. Let’s build something wonderful together! 

Please write “Keyleth” in the FIRST LINE
