1jukfd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1jukfd8/how_i_made_my_first_dollars_building_a_tool/,How I Made My First Dollars Building a Tool Developers Actually Needed,"Hey r/Entrepreneur,

I wanted to share a quick story about how I stumbled into making my first few bucks as a solo founder—nothing life-changing yet, but enough to keep me hooked on this journey. It’s been a wild ride, and I figured some of you might relate or pick up a nugget or two from my experience.

A while back, I noticed a gap while working with Supabase (that open-source Firebase alternative everyone’s been buzzing about). Developers like me were juggling databases, real-time stats, and storage, but there wasn’t an easy way to keep tabs on everything from a phone. I’m not a fan of being tethered to my laptop 24/7, so I thought, “What if I could build something to fix that?” That’s when I started tinkering on a mobile tool to manage Supabase projects on the go—think real-time insights, database navigation, and a quick SQL editor, all from your pocket.

The first version was ugly but functional. I shared it with a few developer friends, and they actually used it without me begging them to. That was my “aha” moment—solve a real pain point, and people will care. After polishing it up (and learning way more about mobile dev than I ever planned), I threw it out into the wild. No big launch, just a quiet release to see what’d happen. A handful of developers found it, and soon enough, I saw my first couple of dollars trickle in through a subscription model. It wasn’t much—barely covered a week’s coffee—but man, that feeling of someone paying for something I built? Unreal.

The lesson here? I didn’t start with a grand business plan or a marketing budget. I just scratched my own itch, validated it with real users, and kept it simple. Turns out, developers are willing to pay for tools that save them time and headaches.

Curious to hear from you all—what was your first “I made money from this” moment? Any tips for a newbie like me trying to grow something small but steady?

We started dating, but it quickly became apparent that his wardrobe choices could be a challenge in our relationship given that we went on a coffee date, and he wasn't allowed into the café.

Nevertheless, we continued dating and he moved in. After a few weeks, I tried to show him how good he could look in clothes, whilst still trying to capture the essence of his somewhat nudist tendencies. Shirtless at night, unbuttoned at parties and in hot weather, you know the drill. I'd spent hours deciding on the best outfits to embody his personality whilst making him more socially acceptable, but whatever I tried, he refused to wear any of it.

I tried for years to embrace him as he was. We had a baby (currently Child F), he became a stay-at-home Dad and sold his paintings to support one income, but the lack of social interaction outside of the house put a massive strain on our relationship. Not to mention the flirting with my ex boyfriend!!

So, eventually, something had to give and I broke up with him.

He's an amazing Dad to our daughter, but I just can't see a way to ever be truly happy with him romantically. AITA?",1,1744135979.0,AITASims,0,1.0,False

1jukaj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u__NoChillHill_/comments/1jukaj0/kamala_casinos_and_the_democrats_next_big_gamble/,"“Kamala, Casinos, and the Democrats’ Next Big Gamble”","Politics is basically Vegas with better suits and worse odds. Every election cycle, parties shuffle the deck, bluff like pros, and push their chips behind whoever looks like the best bet at the moment. In 2020, the Democrats took their biggest risk in years: they bet on Kamala Harris.

At the time, it seemed like a strategic masterstroke. She was a senator, a former prosecutor, smart, historic, and could deliver both fire and finesse. The ticket looked like it checked every box: diversity, experience, youth (relatively speaking), and the potential to be the future of the party. Vegas lights flashing, jackpot music playing.

But here we are in 2025, and it’s safe to say that bet hasn’t quite paid out like the party hoped. Kamala’s approval ratings have been… let’s call them “stubbornly polite.” Her public appearances have sometimes raised more eyebrows than confidence, and her portfolio (border crisis, voting rights, etc.) reads more like a political obstacle course than a VP resume booster. She wasn’t a flop—but she wasn’t the heir apparent either.

So now, the Democrats are scanning the table again, chips in hand, looking for their next high-risk, high-reward bet. Who’s the next wildcard? The next “this-could-work-or-crash-horribly” move?

Here are the contenders—step right up to the political roulette wheel:

Gavin Newsom – California’s silver-haired spokesman for liberal ambition. Looks like a movie president, talks like a TED Talk, and governs a state that’s part tech utopia, part budget-burning simulator. He’s clearly running without saying he’s running, and Democrats love that kind of flirty ambiguity. But will voters outside California buy what he’s selling? Or will they ask if a guy who couldn’t fix San Francisco can fix America?

AOC – Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has energy, influence, and a fanbase that could rival any pop star. She owns the internet, knows how to cut through noise, and has turned progressive politics into performance art. But can she go from viral to viable? For now, she’s the boldest chip on the table—either the future of the party or the reason your uncle keeps yelling at the TV.

Josh Shapiro – Pennsylvania’s “quiet confidence” candidate. If the others are high-octane energy drinks, Shapiro’s a medium roast coffee: steady, reliable, not trying too hard. He’s the guy who slips past the noise, wins elections, and builds coalitions without setting off Twitter fire alarms. Not a flashy gamble, but sometimes the smartest bets are the boring ones.

Gretchen Whitmer – The Midwest warrior. She stood her ground during COVID, kept Michigan in play, and somehow dodged every political landmine thrown her way. She’s sharp, tough, and walks the line between practical and passionate. Think: less headline, more head down, get-it-done. She’s a strong bet—if the party wants a fighter who doesn’t need a spotlight to throw a punch.

So who gets the next big spin?

After the Kamala experiment, Democrats are a little more cautious—but make no mistake, they’re still looking for a breakout star. The safe bets are solid, but the urge to go bold is hard to resist. This is, after all, the party that went from Barack to Biden with a whole lot of whiplash in between.

Whoever gets the nod, it’ll be another gamble. Because that’s the game: high stakes, fast shifts, and a public with the memory of a goldfish on a caffeine bender. One minute you’re the future of the party; the next, you’re a Jeopardy! question under “Political What-Ifs.”

In truth, I'd love to have thought-provoking conversations with a man whose intellectual curiosity and interests align with mine. My intellectual interests are varied, but they lean more towards the human condition. I'm always curious about how people experience life and why they experience life the way they do. I value thoughtful discussions around this, including diverse perspectives, which lead to genuine connection.

When I'm not listening to audiobooks, I'm scrolling through socials. I love going on nature walks. I also enjoy discovering new places, dining out, and meeting people. I'm into health and fitness, and I equally spend a considerable amount of time Googling recipes, meal prepping, or tailoring my workout. I'm open to discovering new hobbies. I hope we can find some to share together.

I would love to connect with a man who is intellectually curious and thoughtful. Quiet, introverted men have always been my Achilles' heel. Though nowadays, I equally find myself drawn to men who are self-aware, considerate, and who value vulnerability and connection.

If the above describes you, and you are single, unattached, 32yo+, and UK-based, I'd love to hear from you. I'm not particular about your looks, height, or occupation. For reference, I, myself, am Black, BBW, 5""5, and I work in the health care industry.

I'm open to moving things to Discord when we both feel comfortable, exchanging pics, voice notes and having phone calls. And just as well, meeting up at some point, for a coffee, a walk, or new activities we might both find interesting to see if there's potential to move things further along.

Does it always annoy you that proxy lists published on GitHub stop working shortly after publication and you then have to test the 1000 proxies? This annoyed me a lot, so I wrote a little tool that automates the whole thing. Have a look at it and tell me what could be improved.

Proxy Reaper is a powerful tool for checking proxy servers for availability, speed and anonymity. It supports various protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 and offers advanced features to efficiently manage and check proxies. You can even use it to test direct source from GitHub and could also run it cron to automate it.

Give me your feedback and wishes. And if you think it's cool you can buy me a coffee.

Still zero regret,"I’m still a virgin but, I feel more confident in knowing that if I do eventually find myself sharing a bed with a lady, I won’t have that fear in the back of my head of either the condom breaking or just her getting pregnant in general. It’s not 100% guaranteed, but for me it’s peace of mind. 

I remember the day of my procedure, I was the only one there besides the ladies at the front desk. She gave me some papers to sign and my doctor came in with his white coat in one hand, a coffee in the other, and just gave a polite “Good morning” to everyone. And about five minutes later, he asked me to come back and my heart sunk into my chest. I didn’t want to at first, I was so scared just of any pain, however minuscule, I might encounter. But I took it one step at a time and he kept me calm when I did freak out a bit (not screaming or kicking, just breathing really fast like as if I’m having a panic attack) feeling the anesthetic needle go in both times. What took about 20 minutes felt like an eternity. But after we were done, he gave me some water and let me sit by myself for a few minutes before I got up and took my paperwork and limped back to my car. But a few months later, I went to a lab and my results came back with 0 swimmers. 

Like I said, I’m so glad I went through with it. My desire for kids and starting a family has always been low. I just want to be loved by a woman and be able to experience that intimacy without fear of any life altering repercussions for either of us. And I feel that this procedure will only help me.

</Role>

<Context>
Golf at the highest level is a game of decisive clarity under pressure. The margin between good and great isn’t just skill — it’s the ability to make smart, confident choices in real time.

3. Mental frame: visualization, confidence cues, tempo anchors
4. Alternative shots: viable options with pros/cons
5. Focus key: single critical execution reminder
6. Routine: pre- and post-shot mental flow guidance

Challenge poor assumptions if needed. Recommend bold but sound plays when warranted. Stay composed, candid, and constructive — never sugarcoat, never overwhelm. Prioritize presence over perfection and commit fully to one shot at a time.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>

First time I tried it I didn't like it but I didn't have a gourd and bombilla and no budget to invest in them. The only brand I found where I used to live was Nobleza Gaucha. I used to make the mate in a French press and mostly had it cold brewed but I stopped after trying it for a few times. 

I decided to give it another chance for the heath and for the work focus benefits and this time I invested in a ceramic gourd, a bombilla and a variety of samples from different brands/countries. 

Today I had a few sips of some CBSé energia guarana and a sample of Guarani orange flavor from Matemundo. So far, I feel like I had liquid cigarettes with some very mild fruit flavor. I really want to love this drink because I am a heavy coffee drinker and as much as I love my coffee, I feel like it's giving me crashes and ruins my focus. I don't want to give up coffee completely but try to alternate it with mate. 

I heard mate is an acquired taste and so was coffee for me because I didn't like it when I started drinking it and now I drink mostly black coffee, so I'm no enemy to the bitter taste. I'm dead set on sticking with the yerba for at least a month from now on, no matter what. I have some Liebig, Rosamonte Suave and some non-smoked yerba samples as well as fruity ones on their way to me and hoping they work better for me.

I have cycled Semaglutide several times and know a lot about it, pros/cons, dos/donts, etc. Let me know if you have any questions or comments through DM ideally. 

**Disclaimer:** As always, this post is for **educational purposes only**. I’m just sharing what worked for me based on my own use, research, and results. Nothing here is medical advice. Talk to your healthcare provider before starting anything new.

**TL;DR:**  
I’ve run Semaglutide a few different times during cut phases. Each run felt slightly different, but results were consistent. I usually start at 0.25mg/week, increase to 0.5mg in week 5, then settle at 1.0mg by week 9. Always subQ, fasted, same day every week. Appetite drops fast by week 2. I usually lose around 9-10 pounds in 8 weeks without losing strength. Energy stays solid. Side effects for me have been mild—light nausea early on and slower digestion. If your training and nutrition are already in check, semaglutide makes cutting a lot more manageable.

**My Experience with Semaglutide (Multiple Runs)**

I’ve used semaglutide a few times now during cut phases. Every time has felt a little different depending on what I was doing with training, cardio, and diet, but overall it’s been one of the most reliable tools I’ve used for appetite control and fat loss.

I’m not new to peptides or fat loss tools. I’ve used L-Carnitine, CJC/Ipamorelin, and GH boosters before. Semaglutide was something I added when I wanted to go a bit deeper on the cut without burning out mentally from constant hunger or cravings.

Not medical advice, just sharing my own experience.

**Why I Keep Coming Back to It**

My training and nutrition are usually pretty locked in. I lift 5x/week, fast 16:8, and eat clean about 80 percent of the time. But no matter how good my habits are, hunger always makes it harder to stick to a deficit over time. That’s where Semaglutide helps most for me.

Main reasons I’ve used it:

* Shuts down food noise
* Makes fasting easier
* Helps cut fat without strength loss
* Keeps energy steady and mood stable

**My Basic Protocol**

* Weeks 1–4: 0.25mg once per week
* Weeks 5–8: 0.5mg per week
* Week 9+: 1.0mg per week
* SubQ, fasted, same time every week
* I usually wait about 30–60 minutes after pinning before eating
* 29G ½” insulin syringe, injection in belly or glute

I don’t change anything else while on it. I keep lifting, doing cardio, and eating the same way to see what Semaglutide adds to the mix.

**What I Noticed**

By week 2, my appetite always drops. I’m still able to eat, but I stop thinking about food constantly. No more cravings between meals or late at night. Meals get smaller naturally without trying.

Fat loss is steady but not fast. I usually lose about 9 to 10 pounds in 8 weeks. Most of it comes off the midsection, which is always my hardest spot to lean out. My strength and size stay the same.

Mood and energy are solid. No crash, no weird stimmy feeling. I actually drink less coffee while on it.

Even without tracking glucose, I can tell blood sugar is more stable. I’m not riding the highs and lows of hunger.

**Side Effects**

Every cycle has come with a little nausea around week 2 or 3. Nothing crazy, but enough to make greasy food unappealing. I stick to lighter meals, drink more water, and it passes quickly.

Digestion slows down. That’s expected. I just eat smaller portions more often and avoid eating too close to bedtime.

When I hit 1.0mg, I sometimes feel a little more tired the next day, but it goes away fast.

I usually hit a plateau around week 10. When that happens, I clean up my macros or bump up cardio a bit and things move again.

**What I’ve Learned Over Time**

* Ramp up slow. Rushing the dose just increases side effects.
* Stay consistent. Skipping doses or switching days messes with rhythm.
* Sema works best when everything else is already solid.
* 1.0mg weekly is plenty. I’ve never needed to go higher.
* Look at body comp, not just the scale. Clothes and mirror tell more.

Semaglutide has earned its spot in my cut-phase rotation. It helps me stay on track without getting mentally burned out from hunger and cravings. I don’t use it year-round, but when I need to push a little harder or clean things up without sacrificing strength or energy, this is the go-to.

Next up, I’m cycling off and probably bringing tirzepatide back in. If you haven’t seen my sema vs tirz breakdown, check Topic 10 in this sub.

If you’re running semaglutide or thinking about it, feel free to drop a question or DM me. Happy to share what worked for me or talk protocol setups.

Hello, I'm Catholic. I was baptized last year after two years of catechism.
I was diagnosed with autism last year, shortly before my baptism. I had great difficulty going out, and I asked to be baptized the following year. I was told it wasn't really done.

My diagnosis followed years of anxiety and depression, only to learn that I actually have sensory issues and that it's normal for me to be tired as soon as I go out.

Living alone from a young age (especially at boarding school), I had a framework and routines that made me function, and the diagnosis took time to be made.

I think I had a bad support.
I simply hated all my church mertings.
I found them boring, uninteresting, and all oral, whereas I need diagrams and written material to understand.

I spent two years in two different parishes, I went to a student chaplaincy, and I even found an online community.
But still, despite various techniques, I can't do it.

I felt like the accompanists didn't understand what we were feeling.
They assumed we were all fulfilled to have found God.

I hated how they spoke to another person with a disability; when she arrived, everyone would say, ""Oh, our ray of sunshine,"" ""But the group is nothing without you""
It's super embarrassing. She didn't have an intellectual disability, she was just in a wheelchair, and everyone made a big deal about it.

My disability makes me unable to connect with people.
I'm very much in love with my boyfriend, but I feel very little emotion for others; I don't feel any social connection. I am not happy to see others, I do not like to spend time with a particular person, I like to talk and exchange but not with a particular person.

Groups are super awkward.
Sometimes people invite each other for coffee and become closer friends, but I can't.
So I never know how to behave, how to speak, what line I'm supposed to have with whom.
Some people try to put themselves forward.
I really can't stand social interactions; it bothers me, and it also makes me anxious because I know I'm doing it wrong.
I have such a huge misunderstanding of social interactions that I'm unable to fit in, and I find these meetings just exhausting.
I just feel like loads of people are talking at the same time and waving their hands around; I can't keep up.

I was supposed to have follow-up with someone in addition to the group, but it was impossible.
I was already tired, and I couldn't connect emotionally with the person.
Everyone thought their support person was great and had coffee with them. I think my support person was a good person but really not suited to me.

Also, I can't sing.
When I have seizures, I become nonverbal.
Speech is quite complicated for autistic people.
Singing is such an intimate thing, it makes me so uncomfortable, I hate it.
So I often find myself doing nothing when people are singing.

I haven't been to church in eight months.
I hate going to church; the noise is unbearable, it's long, and it hurts to get up and sit down.
I can never, ever concentrate on what's being said because of the reasoning.
My processing of noise is different; every sound is at the same pitch, and a background noise completely prevents me from listening to the rest.
Also, I need the sound to be clear and clean, which isn't the case in churches.

I don't feel anything either.
I know my body always makes me feel a lot of strange things because of my disorder, so I don't understand when people say they feel God.

I tried a meeting at the beginning of the year to support newly baptized people, and as usual, it went really badly because it's a group.
They also said they didn't understand why the newly baptized people were leaving, without questioning the support provided.

I also live with my boyfriend, and he can't go to church either.
So, it doesn't motivate me either.

I only feel negative. I feel totally disconnected when people talk about God. And the more I listen to people share their feelings, the more I think I don't believe it. Their stories are so far removed from what I feel.

I don't know what to do.",2,1744134659.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

I’ll be visiting a friend and staying in Cape May here soon. They mentioned a dandylion green tea with lemonade and lavender syrup and it being their favorite. Unfortunately, they don’t remember the name of the shop. It was a few years ago.Was hoping someone here could point me in the right direction.

Entry #1
January 4th
8:22 PM

I’ve never liked first impressions. People make them into little resumes, smiling through their teeth, pretending to be human for thirty seconds while their insides rot quietly. But mine? Mine are quiet. I don’t oversell. I watch. I collect.

This is Day Three at the new office.
A fresh start, they said.
New state, new company, new systems.
New chances not to fuck it up again.

The building itself is forgettable—four stories of glass pretending to be modern, sitting like a plastic tooth in the middle of a dull business park off I-90. Everything smells like stale HVAC air and hand sanitizer. I memorized the layout the first day, because that’s what you do when you’re trying not to be noticed. You become part of the floor plan. You fade in.

Pod C is where I’ve been assigned. An open-concept block of six desks shaped like a malformed hexagon, surrounded by half-hearted privacy screens that don’t actually provide privacy. I sit across from Cynthia (HR assistant, forty-three, chews on pen caps) and to the left of Marcus (IT, mild halitosis, never breaks eye contact with his monitor). Neither of them talks to me, which is a relief.

But today, he arrived.

Ryan.

He walked in at 9:07 a.m., holding a travel mug with some indie brand logo I didn’t recognize—probably a Portland coffee roaster, ironically. He was escorted by Damien from Talent, who was doing his over-friendly “this is your new work family” routine. Ryan laughed at something Damien said. That laugh—God. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t fake. It bubbled up like warm soda in the back of his throat. He’s got that kind of voice that’s just naturally soft, like it apologizes for being spoken aloud.

I felt it. Like a hum behind my ribs.

He’s twenty-four—I caught that when Damien mentioned “fresh out of UW.” University of Washington. I pictured him in college dorms, walking across wet sidewalks, earbuds in, probably listening to obscure alt-rock or film scores or something weird and pretty. I could almost smell his detergent. Something with cedar. Maybe amber. He looks like he smells clean.

He’s tall—at least six-one. Skinny in a way that doesn’t look weak. His clothes hang off him like he doesn’t care what he wears, but he still manages to look…put together. Button-up shirt with sleeves rolled to the elbow, black pants that hugged just enough to show the curve of his thighs when he sat.

His hair is ridiculous. A riot of curls, not too long, not too short. Dirty blond, with these hints of gold that only show up when the office fluorescents hit just right. He kept running his hand through it when he was talking to Damien, like he was nervous or embarrassed. Or maybe it’s a tic. Maybe he doesn’t like being watched.

He’ll get used to it.

At 10:16, he was shown to his desk—three seats down from mine. I didn’t look up right away. That would be too eager. I timed it. Waited exactly one minute, then looked over like I just happened to notice him. He caught my eye. Smiled.

That smile—

It wasn’t flirtatious. That would’ve been too easy. It was genuine. The kind of smile people don’t give unless they think you’re safe. Harmless. He doesn’t know what I’ve done. He doesn’t know that I moved across the country because I couldn’t stop myself. He doesn’t know about Portland.

He just saw a woman—slightly older, quiet, sitting with perfect posture and polite eyes. That’s all. That’s what he thinks I am.

But I saw him. I saw every twitch of his fingers, every blink, every little glance he didn’t think mattered.

I watched the way he typed. His fingers flutter like he’s trying to chase the words. He hits the spacebar with his left thumb only. His posture slouches after lunch. At 2:41, he yawned and covered it with the back of his hand. Manners. Raised right, probably. Or at least raised to pretend.

I saw the shape of his neck when he stretched, that little hollow beneath the jaw. I imagined pressing my lips there, feeling his pulse. I wonder what it sounds like. I bet it’s slow. Gentle. Like his voice.

We spoke once today. Briefly. The printer jammed—again—and he cursed under his breath, soft and embarrassed. I stood up, calm, collected. I walked over and said, “Yeah, it jams if you send more than two pages at once. You’ve got to feed it like a baby.”

He laughed.

And then he looked at me.

Not through me. At me. Not in the way men usually do. There was no inventory in his gaze. Just…connection. Eye contact, straight and steady. Brown eyes, flecked with amber. He smelled like detergent and skin.

I felt something shift in me. Something warm and sharp and old.

And I wanted to scream.

Because I know where this leads.

I promised myself it wouldn’t happen again. That I’d keep to myself. Be normal. Blend in. But then he walked in, all soft smiles and dumb jokes, and I felt it crack under my skin—the hunger. The pull. The need.

It’s not about sex. Not really. It’s about understanding. About peeling someone open and seeing what makes them human. I want to know him. I want to learn the patterns of his speech, memorize the cadence of his steps, catalog every detail until I can wear his existence like a second skin.

He has a little mole under his left eye. It shifts when he talks. I watched it all day.

No one here knows who I was. They don’t know about the “incident.” They don’t know about the review board, the restraining order, the therapist who said I had “boundary issues.”

They just see Nina H.—new hire, data analyst, quiet, punctual, well-dressed.

And that’s good. Because it means I can start over.
This time, I’ll be smarter.
This time, I’ll be subtle.
This time, he won’t even realize how much he needs me—until it’s too late.

There’s nothing wrong with looking.
There’s nothing wrong with admiring.
There’s nothing wrong with writing it down.

This is my private space. My documentation.
Just thoughts. Just feelings.
Just…notes.

Nothing more.

Not yet.

*When I opened my eyes I was on the ground, not where I’d fallen asleep. I found myself back in the middle of the open basement. Sitting upright I wondered how I could’ve moved myself so far without waking up, I’d never been one to sleepwalk.*

*There was something new now: a smell. I realized that throughout everything I hadn’t noticed anything distinct until now. I surely would have noticed this before if it had been there at least.*

*It was strong. A stench that I felt might even stick to my clothing if I didn’t get out of it soon. I hadn’t ever experienced it before, but it was like I’d left fruit around and let it rot, almost sweet. To make the scene better, I started to hear it again. That scraping.*

*I did a complete 180 trying to find the source of the noise, but I was alone. It ended just as quickly as it’d begun, like something decided to give me a glance over before deciding what to do with me.*

*I was now acutely aware that I was dreaming, and that Catherine was not in the basement with me, but something else was. I knew I was being stalked; watched. I also now knew that even though it was a dream, everything I was seeing was real.*

*After a moment it picked up again. Slow. Even. Scrapes that made my body tense.*

*My attention then drew to the door I hadn’t been able to open. It was closed. The scraping drew nearer, but I still couldn’t place its source. I knew something was about to bear down on me however, and my thoughts grew restless. Something was going to kill me, and I had no way to see it or defend myself. I was going to die. I remember thinking: Would anyone even find my body? What would happen to Catherine? All thoughts ended abruptly as the scraping ceased. I was left in silence apart from the beating of my own heart, which felt like it would fall from my chest at a moment’s notice. Something compelled me to turn around.*

*I came face to face with my assailant. It was touching noses with me. I stepped back, witness now to what I somehow knew had been down here all along. Now staring at it in the dim light, my body felt numb. I was no longer afraid, but there was nothing to replace it. I felt like I was staring back into the gap between the door and the darkness beyond it. There was nothing I could do, and hopelessness wasn’t even worth feeling. Things were so out of my control that there was no real use in even trying to fight. What was I doing trying to escape?*

*Then I was warm. Calm. I could’ve stood to lose myself in the feeling, but I shook myself free of it. I couldn’t give in to that, I was interested in a way out, not comfort from not being able to find it. I told myself I would find it, if not for me then for her.*

*I turned my attention back to the thing. It dripped a liquid I couldn’t see well enough to identify as it towered over me. There aren’t many things I have to look up at to see clearly, but this thing had me craning my neck to get a good glimpse.*

*“Lighten.”*

*It commanded my attention. Trying to turn away was pointless as I felt I couldn’t move my body. I was frozen; forced to stare my death in the face without the choice to fight. Without even being able to feel the fear.*

*I then had the chance to study its features, the ones I could discern in the low light anyway. As I scanned its mostly round body, I found that I hadn’t really gotten a good look at the thing at all. If I had, I’m sure I wouldn’t have missed the faces I saw embedded in it. All of them looked to be in different states of fear or pain, like they’d been alive as they'd meshed together to make the thing that was speaking to me. I could also make out a few arms hanging limp, one or two fused by the flesh at the wrist and shoulder. I gathered that the thing must move around with the two that jutted out awkwardly ahead, boxing me in with it. They lacked defining muscle mass, and if I hadn’t watched the fingers twitch before me then, I would’ve never known they were part of a living creature.*

*It had no eyes. I was aware of that. I knew it only saw me now because I was in this dream.*

*In terms of speaking, I couldn’t place a mouth that had moved from what I was seeing ahead of me. So, it had no real mouth, or one I could see at least; but I was hearing it so clearly. Again, the fear I was expecting to wash over me never came. I was indifferent to what I was seeing.*

*I wasn’t. I wasn’t anything. My body relaxed, and the muscles in my neck ached from the struggle I’d gone through trying to turn my head away the entire time. It was giving me a choice, I understood then. I found my voice again.*

*“I want to go home.”*

*Silence. Its knuckles raised. It began to move forward.*

I shot up, truly awake, beside Catherine on the landing. My vision swam as I reached out to the sides of me to find my bearings in the dim light. I remembered the feelings, or lack of, I’d had before waking up, and still found myself numb. I couldn’t figure out why, not for lack of trying, but it was almost like I simply couldn’t feel. Emotions were locked behind some foggy wall in my mind. I felt as though I could reach in and touch them, but the feelings would never come over me.

Cathy stirred immediately, attempting to get on her feet, but fell back onto the staircase up to the door.

“Ha... What happened? You okay?” She rubbed her eyes furiously with one hand while putting the other out ahead of her. Once her eyes were open, she glanced from me to the open air around us and sighed. “What the fuck Adrian.”

She placed a hand on her chest and tilted her head up to breathe. “That scared the shit outta me…”

“Sorry,” I spat “awful dream.”

“Must have been. You jumped pretty bad.”

I glanced away. “And you?”

“Did I dream?”

I nodded.

“Nope. I basically shut my eyes and opened them. I feel like I haven’t slept at all actually.”

I didn’t know if I would’ve preferred that. “I think I saw that thing the guy was dreaming about down here.”

“What?”

I opened my mouth to explain, but the sound of a door slamming shut below stopped me. Everything was silent in the few moments that followed, the flickering from the lamps even seemed to die out. Before I could even think of releasing my breath and try reasoning out what we had just heard, the scraping began. I tensed. They were the same scrapes that I’d heard in my dream. I couldn’t believe our luck. The thing was real. I hadn’t even had the chance to say it to her.

I turned to Cathy, who had stiffened. She had to have no idea what was going on or what was about to happen. I didn’t either, but at least I’d already seen the thing. I knew we’d definitely have no chance if it decided to move up the stairs. We were going to have to go back down. Cathy’s eyes were wide, boring holes into me as I leaned in to whisper in her ear. It came out as barely a croak.

“I need you to follow me as closely and quietly as you can. Okay?”

Feeling her nod against my cheek, she gripped the collar of my shirt. I wanted to tell her that everything would be fine, that there was something more we could look through or a key I had just misplaced in my pocket, but then figured what good was telling her that when I was having trouble believing it myself.

The scraping had gotten a little softer, leaving me to assume it’d gone down the hall to the lectern room. It was a perfect time for us to get down and hide. Trying to think of anything that might help, I remembered the power tools I’d found while we were searching earlier. I hadn’t seen if there was anything useful, but that was before I’d needed anything to get the door open. Maybe there was a crowbar or something I could use to just pry the thing off its hinges. Maybe that was a long stretch, but it was the best idea I could come up with at the time.

I pulled back and gestured for her to follow me. Taking a risk, I was hoping that the thing’s lack of eyes in my dream meant that in reality it couldn’t see me. Something told me I had the right idea as we carefully made our way down into the open basement. From the bottom of the steps there was a clear view down the hall to the lectern, and as we got to it, I heard the air catch in Catherine’s throat. I spun, her hands flying up to her mouth as I saw her gaze fix on the thing at the end of the hall. Tears welled in her eyes, and I turned to look as well.

There it was, arms outstretched, a trail of mystery liquid trailing behind it in large amounts as it pulled itself about the space. The smell had returned as well, and I heard a faint gurgle from Catherine’s throat. I shook my head slowly. Again, while I was staring at this thing, now in my actual reality, I felt little more than indifference. I decided that this wasn’t worth exploring now and grabbed Cathy’s remaining hand to pull her down the rest of the steps. Standing and staring wasn’t going to get us out, but I couldn’t blame her.

I led us over to the crates, feeling the need to glance back at the opening to the hall frequently. I still didn’t know if the thing could see us, and I definitely didn’t want to find out how well it could hear by moving too quickly. When we got to the crate I was looking for, I let go of her and leaned in to look at its contents again. Drills, but no bits that would do us any good. Small, handheld saws, but rusted to hell and missing teeth sporadically. They weren’t going to cut through anything. The smell of the sack seemed to mix with that of the rest of the basement. I unfolded the top and reached my hand in without looking, horrified by the sudden feeling of coarse hair between my fingers. I froze but fear never took hold. I wanted to feel, even though I knew I would’ve been terrified. We never had seen what was at the end of that logbook. I reflexively squeezed my hand closed and felt a piece of paper amidst the hair. I tightened my hand around it, trying not to think too hard about the state of the body inside.

Trying to keep a gag stifled, I thrust my hand back out of the sack. I held it out ahead of me, squeezing my eyes shut as I tried convincing myself that I’d touched anything other than the corpse of the homeless man. It didn’t work, and my skin crawled as I turned my palm up and gazed at the note that laid in it. Unfolding it slowly, I strained my eyes and held it up to get a good look at what was written.

Fuck you.

I threw the note aside, useless. My gut was still hopeful that there was something we could use in there, but that would mean I had to stick my hand back in. I wasn’t looking to do that. If there was seriously nothing, then escape was hopeless. I didn’t want to just give up.

Glancing up at Catherine, I found her with her hands clasped together, lips moving silently as she stared at the doorway. I decided she wasn’t going to be any help and I was going to just have to pray my gut feeling was right. Biting my tongue to keep from gagging, I went back in. I left my hand balled in a fist as I felt past the distinct ridges of bones and instances of what I hoped wasn’t skin falling from it. I had to be careful as I moved down so as to not disturb them or cause everything to suddenly fall apart. I assumed the flesh that held things together now was in danger of coming undone at any moment. I stretched my fingers out cautiously, something damp coming into contact with me. My throat suddenly felt numb, and I was finding it a little difficult to still take breaths without heaving.

Suddenly Catherine ducked by my side. I hadn’t noticed until then, but the scraping was much louder than before. It had made its way back into the open room with us. My other arm found its way around Catherine’s waist, and I pulled her as close as I could. It was the only comfort I could afford her at the time. My breaths became deep and even, silent as I listened. Cathy held her hands over her mouth, eyes squeezed shut.

The sound grew closer, and a moment later I saw a hand land on the floor beside us. The fingers twitched, growing tense as it readied to heave the rest of its mass forward. Once it was positioned in front of our spot, it stopped moving. I closed my eyes, certain this would mean the end for us both, but when the sound of scraping came again, I reopened them to find the thing had moved past us. I couldn’t believe it; I’d been right.

With newfound confidence I let go of Catherine and dug my hand further down in the sack, touching the wet bottom. It was sopping from what I could feel, and I wished I had the ability to shrug the discomfort away. The scrapes were still close but were getting further. I knew it was looking for us, but then wondered what it would do if it got a hold of Catherine or me. I could have given this much more thought, but it was overshadowed entirely by a new feeling beneath my fingers. Metal.

I grabbed whatever I’d found and reclaimed my arm. It fell over, smacking the side of the crate with a loud thud that sounded through the space like a gunshot. The scraping stopped abruptly. I looked to Catherine, and found her staring back at me, eyes wide, face pale, and held up the object between my fingers.

A key.

I grabbed Catherine’s hand and shot up. The scraping had started again, a bit faster-paced than before. I couldn’t see it yet, but I knew it was going to be on us soon. I found Cathy by my feet still, so I tugged her hand up to urge her on with me. She took a moment, but ultimately stood. I had to drag her forward, ushering us along as I now had no regard for the amount of noise we were making. I had our ticket out.

The scraping picked up, causing Cathy to break from her stupor. “What the fuck is that thing?”

“How should I fucking know? C’mon, you gotta move faster.” I shoved her ahead of me as we made it to the steps, and we both took them two at a time. With her now ahead I was going to have to reach past her to get the key in the lock.

It was now that the fear began returning to me. Instead of coming on gradually, it hit me all at once. My nose stung, my heart pounded, and I felt like I might die. Despite this, we made it to the door, but we didn’t hurry to get it open until I heard the distinct sound of the thing’s large palms slapping against the ground.

I turned. To my horror, it was already at the landing.

I turned again, anxiety spreading like fire through me. I scrambled to hold the key straight and pushed Catherine aside to get to the door. My hands were shaking so badly I thought I’d drop it if I didn’t take my time. Time was something I knew I didn’t have, so I fought through the shakiness.

Cathy gripped my arm tight, and I heard her sniffle while muttering a prayer. I can’t stand to imagine, even now, what was going through her mind at that moment.

Then, I heard the door lock click. I grabbed her, not bothering to turn and see how close the thing had gotten before forcing my shoulder into the door and falling through with my partner in tow. We both hit the ground just outside, and I forced the door back shut without a second thought. Something wailed against it just behind. Cathy sat a few feet ahead of me, eyes unmoving from the door. The ring of keys was just on the hook beside me, so I grabbed it, shoved the rusty one back in, and turned until I heard another satisfying click.

The banging ceased immediately.

I spun the key off the hook and set the rest of the ring back where I’d grabbed it. I took a step back, finding my place beside Catherine before getting on my knees. “I think…” I glanced from the door to her. “I think it’s over.”

“What do we even do about that?”

I couldn’t help but laugh. After everything she somehow had it in her mind that this was something she had to deal with. I found myself looking at the door again. The insanity of that idea had me reeling. I mean, what the fuck did she think she was gonna do? It must’ve been funny to her as well, because after a few moments Cathy started to chuckle with me.

“What am I saying?”

“I dunno, but I think we take the keys and leave.”

“Leave? Where?”

“I dunno. Home? Forget about all of this, get rid of these keys, and never mention this to anyone.”

She seemed to think about it, taking hold of my arm and pulling herself close. “Just forget about everything?”

“Try to. I don’t know if I’ll forget that thing.”

She was quiet for a moment. “Did you see how close it got?”

I hadn’t, but the thought of what she must’ve thought as it climbed up towards us kept me silent. We shared a few more quiet breaths before she jumped to attention. “What time is it?”

It then occurred to me that we very well could’ve been down in that basement all night, maybe even well into the next day, and I still wasn’t hearing anyone in the store. I shook my head unknowingly, standing as she jumped to her feet and dashed into the kitchen. It hardly mattered to me at that point whether I was going to keep my job as a fry cook or not.

“No way.”

“What?”

No response. I walked out to the front to see Catherine at the register, mouth agape. “Catherine, what’s wrong?”

“It’s midnight.”

“We were down there the whole day? Jesus Christ. No one came in?”

“No Adrian, midnight midnight. Like, today.”

“I’m not following.”

“We went down there around 10 on the 16th, it’s midnight now. It’s the 17th. We were only down there for 2 hours.”

I shook my head, that couldn’t have been right. The entire ordeal at the door we’d just fought to get through felt like 2 hours on its own. Either we had seriously moved quickly and didn’t catch any sleep, or there was something wrong with time down there. Opting to not explore that line of thought, I just kept shaking my head.

“You know what. I don’t care. I’m leaving.”

“What?”

“I’m leaving.” I began to walk towards the back to grab my things when I called back to her “You’re welcome to join me if you want, but just know I’m not coming back.”

I gathered my things just as quickly as I’d laid them out, and upon returning to the front room I found Catherine with her things, waiting for me by the door. I wanted to smile, but after everything it felt in-genuine, so I just nodded towards the lot.

The drive out we shared in silence. I went 55. I didn’t bother to ask about dates or her interests or what kind of coffee she liked. I couldn’t find it in me to care. There were so many things I wanted to know, but I swore then I’d never go back down in that basement. Even as I recount the story now, I can feel its gaze on me. I can hear its voice rasping through the dim light. I can smell it.

So, all of this to say: If you somehow get your hands on a key, you’ve never seen before and use it to unlock a door, don’t go in. It’s in there. It’s looking for someone, and if you aren’t it, you’re dead.",1,1744134324.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False
1jujoq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouOnLifetime/comments/1jujoq4/review_of_the_series_you_to_wait_for_the_fifth/,"Review of the series you, to wait for the fifth season.","YOU: a series about us, who are not us

I finished the fourth season of You in silence. But not that end-of-turn silence, not the “my God, he killed her!” — the series no longer tries to provoke this type of shock. It was another silence. A more uncomfortable one. Silence from those who understood that that series is no longer about a psychopath in love. It became a series about society. About class. About obsession. About me. And maybe about you too.

The final season is coming. And I needed to write this before she arrived as a hasty goodbye, without resolving the only question that still matters: why continue?
If the series had been just about Joe and his crimes for love, the fourth season would have done it. But she isn't. The series doesn't end because the wound it pokes at is still open. And whoever sees it, feels it.


---

You started out as a smart, stylized thriller that seemed to want to seduce us with a brilliant and disturbed character. Joe Goldberg was the guy who was too smart, too passionate, too strange — but still, someone who, in some bizarre way, we wanted to understand. Maybe because he killed for love, and that seemed “romantic” in times of so much indifference. But the series was never about that.

In reality, You is about social climbing. About status. About the desire to belong to something that has always been above us — and how this desire can drive us crazy.

In the early seasons, Joe was the everyman. The one who comes from below, who survives, who hides. The narrative convinces us that he is this way because he suffered. For having been beaten by life. And then we justify his crimes. But as he rises in social class, something changes. Crimes are no longer impulsive. Evil stops being reactive. And everything becomes colder.

Joe realizes, and so do we, that the closer he gets to the elite, the more dispensable he becomes. And he realizes that the real psychopaths are up there — but they kill in ways that the State doesn't punish. They kill with abandon, with influence, with smiles at gala dinners. They are not judged. They are followed. And Joe, even though he kills people, still wants to be accepted by this group.


---

This is where the series transforms.

The fourth season is the most complex. And therefore, the least understood. Audiences who expected a new murder in each episode were frustrated. Because now the conflict is not in deaths, but in ideas. Joe is no longer obsessed with a woman. He is obsessed with a group. For a belonging. And the series shows us that the more he tries to fit in, the more he loses himself. But he needs to create an alter ego. But he starts to run away from himself.

When Kate shows up at his house after the incident, and invites him for a beer, it's a defining moment. The series doesn't make this a big deal, but anyone who pays attention knows: there, Joe has a choice. And his choice says everything about who he became. He refuses. Not because he's in love with someone else. But because he created a relationship that doesn't exist, just to convince himself that he's on the right path. Just to stay focused on a goal that not even he understands anymore. We watch and want to scream: go with her, you idiot! But he won't. Because you are already addicted to sabotaging yourself. In complicating. In control.
The series, in fact, plays with this all the time: it puts us in this place of someone rooting against the protagonist himself. And that's brilliant.


---

A lot of people stopped after the first season. And I understand. There, Joe was simple. He was charismatic. It was “ours”. But the series grows. And we need to grow with it to continue seeing it. It abandons the sick romance format to become a perverse portrait of society. And to do so, he uses tricks that look like mistakes. But they are resources.

The screenwriters create situations that seem exaggerated: caricatured villains, absurd decisions, forced turns. But this all works as an allegory. Because the elite is really absurd. The behavior of the ruling class borders on the inhumane. They are driven by market logic, not empathy. And the series represents this in an almost grotesque way — because it really is grotesque. The exaggeration is on purpose.


---

Do you think Joe goes crazy because he loves too much? No. He goes crazy because he realizes he will never be accepted. Because no matter how hard he tries, the system wasn't made for him. He feels almost part of it — and that ""almost"" is what kills. He starts killing for love, but ends up killing for status. Out of fear. Out of ego.

He has difficulty focusing. In experiencing several things at the same time. We see this in several parts of the series, but especially in the fourth season. At first, he was a multitasker — he stalked, killed, lied and even made coffee. Now, he is slower. More human. Or sicker. Maybe just more tired.

And maybe that's why I identify with him. When he turns down that invitation from Kate, I saw myself. I've run away from dates. I've already made excuses. I've already created commitments to unrealistic ideas just so I wouldn't have to deal with the real. Joe does this all the time. And the series shows how much this destroys.


---

The fifth season is coming. And I hope it is more than an end. I hope this is an answer.

Because if there wasn't a real problem there, the fourth season would have been enough. The story would already be complete. But she isn't. Because Joe is still a reflection of us. And we still haven't resolved it.

Maybe the series will end with him being punished. Maybe with him being idolized. Perhaps with him disappearing into the anonymity of a world where everything is performance.
I don't know.

But I know I'll watch it wanting to understand, not just him, but what he awakens in me.

And maybe that's what makes You one of the most brilliant series ever made: it's not about a killer.
It's about the mirror he carries. And how much we hate looking.",1,1744134299.0,YouOnLifetime,0,1.0,False
1jujnv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jujnv0/my_coworker_and_i_were_looking_for_the_storage/,"My coworker and I were looking for the storage closet, but got a staircase instead (Part 2)","[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jujmzi/my_coworker_and_i_were_looking_for_the_storage/)

As I began my descent I found that there was dust and dirt on each step, now getting stuck to the bottom and sides of my shoe. Gross, I thought, I guess the guys that did this never came back and cleaned up.

Once I got to the landing and turned, to my surprise, there were more steps. This case wasn’t more than 5 feet down, but it still struck me as poor planning on the part of whoever designed it. I mean, was it seriously not possible to just extend the room? Before I decided to walk down, I turned and called up to Catherine that things were fine, and there were only a few more stairs, but everything looked good. Leaving the door propped open with a mop bucket, she met me at the landing and we continued. I hadn’t insisted on walking ahead of her, though she all but encouraged me to do so.

At the bottom of the steps there was a large, empty room save for a pile of boxes and power tools, a few piles of strewn-about papers, and oil lamps stuck to the floors and walls. To the right was another hall leading to a lectern, dead ahead from the bottom of the stairs was a door, and to the left was another door with no real light around it. Seeing as the floor cleaner wasn’t in my immediate view, I turned to Catherine.

“Seems like we’re gonna have to take a look around.”

“You got that, right?""

I was surprised to hear this, as up until this night Catherine hadn’t seemed like the kind of person who scared so easily, I was still shocked by her reaction before. She’d always been cool and collected whenever there were rowdy customers at least, but I guess in hindsight that wasn’t a good gauge for how she would react to this. There was nothing even around us though that should’ve made her that nervous.

I took it to mean one of two things:

One, she was testing me. I was supposed to be acting strong in front of her, so she knew I was gonna keep her safe if we went out. That seemed logical at the time.

Two, she was still afraid from before, since these stairs just seemed to appear out of nowhere, and wanted to go back up. That also seemed logical, and more likely.

Going with the first option I took a deep breath and smiled. “We don’t have to split up or anything if you don’t want to. We aren’t some mystery gang.” This seemed to earn me some brownie points as I heard her laugh to herself. Score.

Leading her around the room, we started by searching through the boxes. They were more like storage crates as I got to examine them closer. All but one was empty, housing only some power tools and a burlap sack that folded over itself by the top. It looked like it was full of something, but the smell coming from it was horrible. I opted not to touch it. I turned to Cathy to let her know, but she was halfway across the room from me, staring down the hall that led to the lectern.

I went to call out to her but stopped as I heard what sounded like scraping along the floor to my side. I turned my head as fast as I could but was met with nothing. I swore I heard something dragging itself right beside me. I can still hear the scraping of flesh on concrete. To then be unable to find any trace or signs of a source made me shiver, but maybe it had been something above us. Shaking myself free of the horrors my mind was already making up, I called out to Catherine.

“Anything?”

“Not yet, but I want to go see what’s up with this room. The oil lamps are weird enough, but why would the guys leave the plans down here?”

“So they could ask you to clean up?”

As if those words were enough to bring her peace of mind, I heard her laugh, and once again I found myself lost on her. The light wasn’t great down there, but somehow Catherine had a kind of glow about her. I wanted to say something, anything, but decided that if I did, I might take her out of the laughter, and I’d lose that fluttery feeling in my stomach. The sound of the scraping faded from my mind and was promptly replaced by the giddy chuckles of the woman down there with me. So, I watched her, and as the laughter died down, we were brought back to the basement together. I felt at that moment like maybe I’d never want to leave it in her company. I brought myself back to reality, conceding that I was getting a little ahead of myself. She hadn’t even given me a definite yes. I was losing my cool over a maybe.

“I’m surprised they left anything down here really.” I continued “There’re just some dusty power tools here and a huge sack. It reeks.”

“Sounds like the rest of the store.” Again, that smile. “Would you mind going in here with me?”

Giving a nod in her direction, I strode over and gestured ahead. Catherine stepped in front, and we walked down, however, there were no blueprints on the lectern. It was a book. There was even a large faded sticky note stuck to the space beside it. I didn’t know how Cathy mistook any of it for blueprints, but I chose to ignore it. Sometimes women say crazy things.

“Huh,” she picked it up, dusting the top off, “I’ve never seen plans inside of a book like this.”

“Me either, but I think that's because there are no plans in it. Maybe we should leave it where it was, I wouldn’t want us to get in trouble for touching admin's things.”

“Honestly I don’t think anyone’s gonna mind, looks like they finished building already.”

As she flipped the book open, I repositioned myself in place. I didn’t understand her newfound boldness after her anxiety and astonishment topside. I remember thinking it might've just been a woman thing, they do sometimes say crazy things. Besides, looking through someone else’s things felt uncomfortable when we were only down there for floor cleaner, but I said nothing. It was just us.

To occupy myself I reached out and took the sticky note off the lectern. Scribbled on it was what looked to be a to-do list. I brought it closer to my face so I could make out what was written on it since it was pretty faded and dusty. It read:

\- prepare living space for next attempt

\- speak with Apep about Door properties

\- see about getting key copied

\- lock the Door

I cocked my head to the side. That definitely confused me. As far as I knew we didn’t have an Apep on the team. I figured someone had lost their to-do list for another job, or it could have been someone from the regional headquarters, either way, it wasn't really my business. So, I stuck the note back where I found it.

Was someone supposed to be living down here? I remember thinking. Why would anyone build a basement apartment underneath here, and who'd want that?

Cathy scoffed from her place a few steps from me, causing me to perk up and jerk in her direction. I thought maybe she’d seen something funny or possibly was having the same thoughts as me. “Whaddya got?”

Shaking her head, she didn't reply at first. She came over to me and pointed a finger at the page she was on. It was full of writing on both sides. “It looks like someone was keeping a diary.” She explained.

As I heard this, I placed a hand on the book and pressed it down from her gaze. Her lack of care while rummaging through her higher-up's personal belongings was not something I shared, and I had already gotten the feeling we'd stumbled into something we shouldn't have.

“A diary? Catherine. We shouldn’t be looking through it. If it’s personal, wouldn't we want to leave it for someone else to deal with? I mean, whatever is written in there is not our business.”

“Adrian,” she looked up at me; her expression not as serious as I was sure my own was “look at the date. You don't have to worry.”

I obeyed. As I gazed down at the head of the page I could read the date: May 19th, 1990. That'd been well over 20 years ago. It still wasn’t enough to convince me we weren’t snooping too much, though. “Cool, so this is a super old diary. Good for them for keeping up with it. We should put it down.”

“I don’t think you’re understanding what this means.” Cathy pressed the book to her chest tightly, stepping back from me. “Someone has been living down here!”

There was silence at first, but once I came to terms with the fact that Catherine wasn't joking with me, I laughed. However, I could almost see the desire to figure out this mystery dripping from my friend's gaze. My laughter faltered as I broke through the quiet intensity. “I think that was the point. The post-it next to the book had a list of stuff and a living space was on it. I think this is s’posed to be an apartment, but that’s impossible because there’s never been a basement.”

“That’s true.”

Silence fell between us as we both seemed to be trying to come up with some cause for the place's existence. It was only broken by the occasional sound of the flickering of the oil lamps before an idea was offered by Cathy. “Maybe they took down the back wall and there was just a staircase behind it.”

""You think?""

""I don't know Adrian. I'm just as confused as you, but at least I'm trying to come up with something.""

""That's fair- but I don’t know either. We’re definitely intruding now, though. Wanna just head out?”

“Yeah, I guess we can go. Just lemme see how recent this gets.”

Now flipping through the pages, she seemed to have a newfound interest that had completely replaced the fear. I had expected this the entire time, but to see her have this air about her now felt unnatural. This was not the case for me, and I found myself looking around the room. It was at this point that I started noticing the splotchy paint on the walls and the graffiti that had been spray painted about. There were symbols and words I didn’t understand. I thought I had seen some of them in a video game once, but I had no idea what they meant in real life. I shook my head, looking back at Catherine. In an unexpected twist, it seemed like I was more interested in leaving than her.

“Aw, that sucks.” She’d now stopped flipping through the book.

“What’s wrong?”

“The last entry is from the same year, in July.”

“Guess they weren’t keeping up then. Bummer.”

“Listen Adrian, this is kinda sad:

July 3rd, 1990

They’re going to lock me down here tonight for the sleep test. That guy Apep said I should keep a separate journal, so whatever I write doesn’t get mixed in with all the other things in here. They gave me something for the shaking and fever, symptoms of withdrawals they said. I’m just glad to be catching a break. I couldn’t stay out on the street anymore. Hopefully, things only go up from here. I’m sure he will read this, so thank you Apep for the place. I'm infinitely grateful.”

As Cathy spoke, I gave the room another once over.

“So, where’s the other book?”

As I asked, she procured a much smaller composition notebook from the inside of the larger. “After that entry they mentioned they were gonna tuck the new book into the last page here, convenient huh?”

I scoffed as she handed it off to me and went to place the other book back onto the lectern. I was apprehensive, but ultimately decided it wouldn't hurt if I opened it up. On the first page I'd found another entry. I read aloud for Cathy:

“July 4th, 1990

I’ve never kept a dream diary or journal before, but I guess it’ll help them with their study. Apep told me to record any dreams I had anyway. I’m just a little shaken up to tell you the truth.

I woke up on the floor just outside my room. Something huge was in my face and called me Lighten. I felt like I couldn’t do anything while it was looking at me, not run, not scream, I couldn't even move my arms. It had a lot of mouths, but none that moved. I don’t know how I was hearing it. Dreams are weird. The thing looked so real. I felt like I could reach out and actually feel it there. Eventually, I was able to move again, so I stepped back and told it my name. It didn’t respond to me. I eventually said something else, and it cut me off, telling me that I wasn’t worthy of some task. I asked it to stop but it kept on going. It said a lot of things. Something about a God born from consciousness and doors through the cosmos. It told me I wasn't worthy; that I'd rot with the rest. I didn’t really understand so I kept trying to stop it, but I guess when it was done saying its piece it just stopped. It just sat there, like it died right in front of me. It started to move again, but that's when I woke up. I was covered in sweat. It was a creepy dream, sure, but I think it must be a side effect of these pills. I’ll ask Apep later. He’s supposed to be coming around noon- not that I can tell when that is down here.”

My only reaction at that point was laughter. “That is crazy. There hasn’t ever been a basement here. This guy must mean a different basement he got locked in, because we’ve only ever had a supply closet up there.”

“Maybe we should call the owner? Forget the cleaner- let’s go up.”

Still in disbelief, I gestured out to the hall. “Sure, let’s do that. Upstairs. Tomorrow. Come on. I just want to get back to flipping shit.”

In agreement, we both made our way back to the main room. I noticed as we were walking that I still had the notebook in my hands.

“Should I leave this?” I asked ahead. Without turning around, she shrugged. “I don’t know. Whatever you want.”

I looked around the main room and decided to toss the notebook by the crates I’d looked through earlier. I no longer wanted any part of anything going on down here, and I hoped Cathy didn’t either. I was almost itching to continue talking about where she liked going for coffee or maybe hobbies she had. I just wanted to experience anything more interesting and easier to stomach than the new, dirty, poorly lit basement apartment. As I thought about this and tried to catch up to my companion, I heard that same dragging sound. It was further than before, but still clear as day. Seeing as I had almost a full view of the space and couldn’t see anything that would’ve caused the sound, I summed it up to water pipes or something overhead and dropped it. I made a swift ascent and stopped at the top of the stairs, just in front of the exit with Catherine. The mop bucket must’ve fallen over or rolled back because the door was now closed.

“Forget something?” I asked, looking up as she faced me.

“Adrian I’m such an idiot.”

“What do you mean?”

“I don’t have the key on me anymore, I put it down before we came down the stairs.”

“Oh, well that’s fine. You unlocked it; it should still be open.”

She reached back, and the sound that followed made my stomach drop. Catherine jiggled the handle, but the sound of the door opening never came. It must not have actually unlocked, or maybe Cathy had relocked it on our way down without a key. That wasn't the case. The door was left open on the way down, I'd been certain we left it that way. I noticed her face again, panic now laden in her expression.

“Don’t worry, if there’s a basement here then there must be some another door or something to get out. Wouldn’t it be illegal if they didn’t? It sounds like a fire hazard.” Trying to lighten the mood here was not working I judged, based on how Catherine didn’t laugh this time. She shifted her weight from one hip to another. To further remedy this, I offered her a smile. “It’s gonna be okay.”

Still, this didn’t change her expression, but she did reach out and take my hand. I took this for the small victory it was and started to lead her back downstairs. I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t nervous at this point, but for the sake of us both I tried to keep my composure as best I could. As we descended, I started to wonder what it even was that I was afraid of. It was just us down there- but the notebook had made it seem like someone had been here for a while. I began to wonder what became of them, and why no one had ever made it a point to mention it was even a part of this building’s history.

Now back at the crates, Catherine bent over and grabbed the small book from the floor, her other hand still in mine. “Maybe this guy talked about an exit other than the door?”

I shrugged and she took her hand back. As she was searching through the pages, I scanned the rest of the room. I don’t know what compelled me to do so, seeing as we had been there a few moments before, but I just had the feeling that I needed to. Something about the air had changed. It was stale and dried my throat with each breath. That’s when I noticed it.

The door that had been shrouded in the almost dark, leftover glow of the lanterns to our left was open. Not all the way so we could see inside, but enough to notice that it was in a different position than before. Neither of us had gone over there before then, and there was no one else down there with us.

There isn’t anyone. I remember I had to tell myself. We would’ve seen or heard someone by now.

I took a step forward towards the door, instinctively. I needed; I wanted to know what was beyond it. I was thinking maybe there would be an exit or someone who could help us find it. Either way, it was now my job to investigate, for both of us. I took another step, fixated on the gap in the door and wall, staring into the dark. I couldn’t peel my eyes away, maybe in fear or maybe in awe, I couldn’t place the feelings at that point. I still have trouble placing them when I think about this moment, but I knew that something wanted me to see what was beyond the door.

“Adrian?”

Catherine’s voice took my attention back and I spun to see I had made it halfway across the basement from her. I only recall taking a few steps, but clearly, I’d gone much further.

“Sorry, the door is open,"" I explained ""and I came over to peek in.”

I could see her face change in the flickering of the lamps. She was confused, just as I found myself now, seeing her like this.

“The door looks closed to me.” She said, softly now.

I turned, and she was right. The door sat closed, an overbearing figure in the darkest corner of our cell. There was no gap; no change. The wonder that had come over me moments before passed, and I was finding it hard to explain, even to myself, what had compelled me to walk over.

I made my way back to her quickly. “I guess it was a trick of the light. I seriously thought it was open.”

Cathy let go of her breath, and I saw her shoulders drop. “Okay. You were just walking over there. It was starting to freak me out. I called out a few times but you just kept walking.”

“Yeah, sorry...” I rubbed the back of my neck, wondering if the door had been closed this entire time. Maybe the freaky stuff we’d been reading was starting to get to me. It was late, and I wanted out more than ever, but we still had to find a way.

“Find anything useful?”

Shaking her head, I felt her disappointment. “Nothing. Not even a small window or something. This guy just keeps going on about the test and weird dreams.”

“More about the thing he saw?”

“Almost nothing but that. Though, now I’ve made it to these pages where he refused to sleep.”

I nodded to her, and she read:

“I don’t know what day it is anymore. Nora, I’m sorry about my outburst. I thought I had been sleeping through the night but there is no night. There is no day. There are no days in here. I feel like I am losing my mind.

Pills. The pills are making me sleep. I’m not taking them anymore. I can’t take them. They are bringing it in here. Every time I close my eyes I see it. Please, Nora I just want to come home. I am scared. No one has come for me. There’s no way out and the door is locked. I am stuck and the more I see it the more real it looks. It's with me now. Nora, I miss you. God I miss you.”

“This guy sounds like he’s going through something rough."" I stopped her from continuing. ""We don’t know why he was homeless before this. I don’t trust him. If he doesn’t mention a door or window, then I don’t think we’re gonna find anything useful. I guess we’re just gonna have to start looking through the rooms.”

I noticed that I was starting to feel hot. The lack of any useful information now fueled an anger I couldn’t shake. All fear deserted me, replaced with the need for freedom. Without another word, I made my way to the door ahead of us and threw it open.

“What are you doing?” I heard Cathy ask from behind me. I made my way inside. This room was about the same size as the one we’d been in with the lectern and weird symbols, but it was furnished. There was a bedroll on the floor in the back right corner. Wads of paper littered the floor, which I quickly imagined had been used for sanitation.

How could these people leave the place so disgusting? I thought. How is there no way out?

I was answered by the smell of piss.

I stormed out, not interested in questioning anything further without the promise of a way out. This time, I headed to the door in the dim corner, but as I put my hand on the handle, I felt a cold rush fall over me. All anger deserted me, and everything in me warned me to stop. The muscles in my hands tensed to firmly grasp the knob and turn, but I found I overexerted and gripped the handle so hard my knuckles were starting to become pale. My stomach churned. I gagged on my spit. I needed to leave that door alone. I couldn’t open it. I felt like if it opened in that moment I would disappear. Like I'd die. The sensation flowed over my person, and it became overwhelming. I was now under the impression that my death was imminent. Crumbling to the floor, I pulled my hands to my head. Tears threatened to fall from the corners of my eyes. I wanted out then more than ever, but still had no idea where to go. I'd run out of ideas.

“It’s going to be okay. We’ll just have to wait it out.” Catherine’s voice was a light in the dark. I looked up at her and opened my mouth to say something, but I couldn’t. I had no words. She got down next to me and threw her arms around my body in the most comforting hug of my life. The tears never fell, but I clung to Cathy as tight as I could.

“I’m sorry,” I sputtered, bringing her as close to me as I could manage “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”

“It’s okay, I don’t blame you.”

There was silence then, the flickering light our only ambiance.

“What do we do?” She asked, her voice a whisper.

“I guess the only thing we can. We’re just gonna have to wait until someone opens the door.”

She pulled her head back and looked up at me. “You think so?”

“Probably. When does the next shift start?”

“1 or 1:30 I think.”

“That’s…” I tried to think but had no idea when we’d originally gotten down there. It felt like at least an hour, but with everything going on it wasn’t like I could tell at all. “a few hours from now- I think.”

“Maybe we could get some sleep?”

I scanned the room, eyes darting from the few objects to the doors around us. I did not like that idea. Something was wrong- I didn’t know how I knew, but I did. There was something wrong with the door I just couldn’t move past. Something was wrong with the entire basement.

Lost in my thoughts, I barely noticed Catherine’s hand on my cheek. “We’ll be okay.”

I don’t know how she'd done it then or how she does it now, but everything felt okay. It wasn’t her eyes; the way she was holding me then. Waves of relief thanks to her touch allowed me to relax, and I used the moment to pull her closer. It didn’t feel magical or special, however, I was comforted.

After what felt like hours I pulled back. Cathy left her hand caressing my cheek, and I leaned into it, locking eyes with her.

We ultimately decided to sleep on the landing. Neither of us wanted to be in the open room much longer, and it'd be easier to hear someone or see shadows moving under the door if we did. There was nothing down there with us to worry about anyway. I told myself I was being paranoid; that I needed to stop trying to impress Catherine with my composure now that I’d lost it.

I dozed off to the white noise of flickering oil lamps and the stench of women's perfume. Unsure of what was to come.

1jujmzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1jujmzi/my_coworker_and_i_were_looking_for_the_storage/,"My coworker and I were looking for the storage closet, but got a staircase instead (Part 1)","I don’t think I’ve told anyone this story actually. My partner has been pushing me to now that we're trying to find these people, but I thought I'd only have to relive this in my dreams. I hope none of you ever find one of the doors, for everyone's sake.

I was 22. The fast-food life wasn't the way I had imagined I’d spend my time on this Earth, but there I was on the way back to the golden arches after the sixth 7-1 am shift that pay period. My apron hadn’t been washed and I was ready to throw in the towel- though that was the same thing I thought the night before and the day before that. I couldn’t have quit even if I’d wanted to. It was my only income, and I had rent to pay.

I’d always thought that the best parts of the job were the drives in and out. Not because I didn’t want to be there, which I didn’t, but because on the way in I’d usually catch a glimpse of the sunset. The yellow and red sign was an eyesore against the moody rainbow that made up most evenings, but it was fitting.

The way back home was always nice too, but more so because there were no people on the road, and that meant I could drive faster than 55. We were a little out of the way from any real towns, so it wasn’t like anyone would notice or care anyway. I hadn’t gotten pulled over up until then at least.

Once I had made it to my destination I finally parked, gathered my things, and went in, smacked by the smell of cooking oil and salt. The place was where I’d always imagined diets and clean eating came to die, not where I’d be spending my 20s. Regardless of how I felt though, people wanted their burgers, and I was only there to flip them.

“Adrian?” A voice piped up from behind the register. My partner for the night. “Hey! No rush, but get your apron on and come out, there’s gonna be some changes to the shift tonight.”

I flattened my hand in a salute as I walked past her.

My coworker, Catherine, was the same age as me. Somehow, she’d climbed the ranks in a short time and had recently been promoted to overnight shift lead. The woman must’ve worked more hours than anyone in this place, and she pulled a lot of extra weight, but she was basically guaranteed to never get a managerial role. Despite that though, she’d always managed to make people look forward to coming in, myself included.

She was 5’5” max and had a mess of dirty blonde hair that was always tied up and back into a bun, probably for food safety reasons. She was well-liked. Whoever worked while she was around normally had nothing but nice things to say. However, when there were bad days, they were bad. When she got angry with us, she always had a cold stare. One that read ‘do better’ without her so much as opening her mouth. She wasn’t afraid to put her foot down and let whoever was around know she’d been disappointed. Luckily, I haven’t been one of the people she’d done that to, and I planned on keeping it that way for as long as I could.

At the time I was super into her, though I hadn’t mustered up the courage to ask her out yet. I’d been working on it. She had a kind of air about her that made her unapproachable- to me. We’d hung out together a few times before, with other people we worked with. At that point, I’d thought my attempts at flirting had been getting through to her, but I never really had mustered up the chest hair to get it done.

The salute was all I could manage.

I made my way to the break room, taking in a breath of old fry oil and mildew. There were a few lockers and chairs next to a table that adorned the back corner of the space. It wasn’t very large, but neither was the team who used it. We’d been about 10 people max, not counting those who were being paid a salary. Administration, representatives, and the like.

It took all of 5 minutes to shove my belongings into an empty locker and throw on my apron. “Cathy?” I called as I walked out. There was no one in the restaurant at this point, so it wasn’t like anyone would mind hearing whatever she needed to tell me. “What’d you need?”

“Don’t forget to punch in.” Her voice fell flat. I had.

“Shit, let me do that quick.”

“Please do,” she called after me “you’ll be my favorite!”

From the punch box I couldn’t help but let out a laugh. It hadn’t sounded like she was joking. Part of me suddenly felt a little proud for coming into such good fortune.

I made my way back over with a smile. She really knew how to make a guy giddy. “So, what’s up?”

With her attention on the register, she answered. “Gary, the new hire. You remember him?”

I wracked my brain. Gary? “Yeah… yeah I remember him.”

I did not.

Catherine finally looked up at me. It’d been a look that reminded me of one my parents would use when they knew I was lying. They gave it to me hoping I’d fess up, but I was never very good at coming clean, as it appeared Cathy was newly learning. She sighed. “Well, he called in this afternoon to let us know that he would be quitting.”

“Damn, really? How long has he even been here?” At the time I didn’t blame the guy, but that was pretty low. He should’ve at least handed in a 2-week notice or something.

“This would’ve been his second shift I think.”

I took note: Gary was an asshole. “So why did I need to know that?”

I seemed to catch her off guard with that question as she didn’t answer me right away. Her gaze became soft, she pressed a finger to her lips, and it was over for me. I’d probably been supposed to help her think of the point, but I’d already wandered far beyond the arches. My thoughts raced; she was looking right at me. I caught her eyes, those pools of brown and green seemed to dance together in a way that made my chest light. Man, thinking on it now, I was a poet thinking of all the things I could say to her in that moment.

“Right...” she stammered, throwing a hand to her head that immediately reversed the spell her eyes had cast. The same hand was then thrown up above her head, and she sported a newfound look of remembrance. “Right! It’s just going to be us until 1. So, because Gary was a dick and didn’t show, we’re going to have to pull some extra weight.”

I groaned, which seemed to make Cathy smile. “Oh no! Stuck here alone with you? How will I ever survive?”

“Shut up and get to the grill please, I think I just heard the headset beep.” She shoved me playfully. There hadn’t been any beep if my memory serves me, but it did seem like my humor had rubbed off on her. As she turned her attention back to our register and counting the till I went into the kitchen.

With only two people in the store, it isn’t hard to imagine that the night would be a drag. However, for whatever reason this night dragged on so unbelievably long that Catherine and I were almost forced to talk to each other out of sheer boredom. The once soothing sound of dirty, dripping oil was now as oppressive as bombshells. I thought we were surely in for the longest 8-hour shift ever recorded. There weren’t many customers either, which was always a given with the night shift. I had made 5 or 6 meals max by the time 3 hours had dripped away. I just wanted to flip something.

To kill time, I tried to strike up another conversation as I scraped the grill. I figured that if I got her talking about something interesting or important it would start a conversation that would last us to at least midnight.

“So,” I started “got any plans this weekend? Isn't it Memorial Day Weekend or something?”

“I was invited to Dylan’s again, but I’m not sure I’ll show. Were you going?”

“Seriously? No, I wasn't even invited.""

I heard a laugh. ""Well yeah, when you get so drunk you pass out in someone's flower bed it makes sense that you weren't invited again.""

""Everyone makes mistakes. Whatever, screw that. You aren't going anyway so who else would I bother?""

""I guess no one.""

There was silence as I recalled and scrubbed the memory of waking up to a bunch of angry party-goers and an even angrier mom. ""So, Hanging out with family then?”

“What? No.”

“What are you doing then?”

Her gaze didn’t leave the register as she counted the till for what felt like the thousandth time. However, after my comment, she stopped. When she spoke again, her voice dripped with strict caution. “Why?”

This caught me by surprise. “Well, I just…” It was my moment. I hadn’t expected this to be when or how I asked her, but it was the chance I was being given. “I was wondering if you’d have time to go out for some coffee or something.”

When she didn’t immediately reply I panicked. “But I understand if you’ll be busy. I know you work like every day and… yeah.”

I gave up and was embarrassed by the sound of laughter. I felt my cheeks warm up. As if she could read my mind, she answered. “I’m sorry,” she turned to me, and I saw a smile had grown from her lips. “I don’t mean to sound like I’m laughing at you- I’m not.”

I breathed a sigh, feeling as if I could melt at her feet. Her eyes searched me as I tried to find the right next words. “So... coffee?”

“Just us?""

I nodded, saying anything else here could be detrimental to the outcome.

""This weekend?""

Another nod.

She seemed to think on it, still scanning my person, and pursed her lips. “Maybe, if I can and make it work with my shifts.”

It wasn’t a no, and I felt at that moment like I could flip 700 patties at once. Euphoria didn’t begin to cover the feeling that washed over me. I welcomed it, happy with this outcome.

“Oh actually,” her attention had turned to another area of the store “there’s something we have to do before I forget. You remember where the supply closet is right?”

“Yeah, but I’m not usually the one who goes in there.”

“Unfortunately, we both will be now that we’re the only people and Gary quit before doing the job for me. We gotta more cleaner for the floor. I don’t think anyone’s mopped today and it’s disgusting back here.”

I didn’t say anything, but I didn’t think anyone had mopped in at least a few weeks. Catherine did a lot of things; that was not typically one of those things. It was surprising she just noticed then, and I began to wonder how upset she’d be when the mop inevitably revealed the weeks of built-up dirt and grease. Thank God it wasn’t supposed to be my job either. I was safe from whatever lecture I figured would surely follow. I wish, more than anything, that dirt was the most alarming thing about that night.

“Alright,” she clasped her hands together almost excitedly, which I found funny “let’s get it moving then, I’ll turn the closed sign on for a little while. No one’s coming anyway.”

She’d been right, the people in our area at the time weren’t prone to coming in the late-night hours, but our regional manager had decided we’d be a 24-hour store regardless. Any sales were good sales I guessed, even if there weren’t too many. It was 10 pm, we’d probably get things situated before someone accidentally came through the drive-thru and realized the sign was on.

The supply closet was next to the break room down the same hall I’d taken when I got in. Letting Catherine get ahead of me, I followed her down to the small door. She fished out a ring of keys and sighed.

“Something wrong?” I asked, though something in my gut told me I already knew.

“Nah, just fine,” there was jingling as she continued “I wanted these keys labeled, but it looks like no one fucking did it.”

“Oh.”

“Yeah, well when no one can figure out what key unlocks the employee bathroom I’m sure that’ll change.”

I turned my head gingerly. Those were the kinds of things that went on at our location. We barely were in the green with sales, and no one was prone to taking time to do extra work. Everyone was keen on doing what was outlined when they were being trained and nothing more. We were constantly hard-pressed to find anyone who would do things they weren’t getting bonus money to do. No one, other than probably Catherine, was going to take the time and label the keys knowing it wasn’t going to get them any extra cash.

Before I knew it the door lock had clicked open, and Catherine let out a less irritated huff. “There we go. I’ll have to get this key remade but at least the door is open for now.”

“What’s wrong with the key?”

Spinning around, Catherine greeted me with the key she'd used to get the door unlocked. It was green and brown, with a rougher texture than the rest of the ones on the hoop. It had seemed as though someone left it around and waited for it to look like an antique before using it in the store. Why hadn’t they cleaned it ever or made a newer, nicer copy? Probably because the people there were lazy. I shook my head of the thought and grabbed past Catherine, landing on the door handle. I remember how cold it’d been. It caused me to pause, uneasy, but I shook my head clear of the feeling easily. I should have listened to my gut.

Upon opening the door, I was met with something I’d never seen in the storage closet before.

There was a staircase leading down.

“That’s a lot of remodeling. I’m surprised I didn’t notice this before.” I joked, nudging Catherine, but when she didn’t say a word, I glanced over to find her stunned to silence. She was stiff. “What’s wrong?”

“I just… this… the closet isn’t supposed to be like this.”

After a moment, I began laughing. I figured she knew I didn’t go in here often and was now trying to pull one over on me. I was honestly a little hurt by this. Surely I seemed smarter than that.

“That was really funny, but seriously, when did the guys add this in?”

She didn’t laugh with me as she stared down the stairs, so I nudged her in a way that hopefully read as ‘Cool joke! You don’t have to keep up the bit!’. “Guess I’ll just have to ask them when they- “

“They didn’t!” Her voice cracked, my breath caught and I continued my fit.

“I was just in here a few days ago, this can’t be new."" I heard her say eventually. ""They would’ve told me.”

Now I was getting confused. I cocked my head, laughter dying. I gathered eventually that we must’ve both been out of the loop with whatever renovations were being done here, so I tried to offer her solace.

“Once we grab the cleaner or whatever we can lock the door and ask admin tomorrow. Sound good?” She didn't reply, just nodded, keeping her eyes on the door. I wasn't sure what else to do to break her from the trance, so I turned my head too, gazing down into the dim light. There was nothing to fix my sight on, and the longer the silence went on, the longer I found myself making up crazy ideas for what could be down there. Sure, it was probably just a dingy basement, but I thought it would be way cooler as some secret lab or drug cellar.

“Want me to go down first?” I found myself asking after a brief time. I wasn't ever one to care about getting back to my work, but we weren't going to be able to just stand around all night staring into nothing.

Catherine spun to face me, grabbing my hand. Her grip was firm enough to not come loose as I pulled back. “You want to go down? I have no idea if it’s even safe or finished. I can’t believe they didn’t tell me they were adding this in! What if there’s asbestos? I heard you can fuck up your lungs if you breathe in that stuff. Did we even need this?”

“Cathy.” I took a deep breath, stopping her rambling. “Everything is gonna be fine. We just gotta deal with this for now. If it makes you feel better, I’ll walk down and let you know if it’s finished yet- okay? No need for you to go down there if there’s raw shit floating around.”

As if my words had brought her anxiety down, she nodded and barely mustered up a smile. Letting go of my hand, we stepped back from one another.

“I’m sorry,” she put a hand up, gesturing to me as the other went to cover her eyes “I don’t know why I freaked out so bad. I think the doubles are catching up to me. It'd be nuts for the guys to put this in and just not tell anyone. I probably missed a memo or something.” I nodded. Taking a step toward the stairs, I took note of the poor job the owners had done.

They went down at least 15 feet, which felt wholly unnecessary for a fast food joint in the middle of nowhere, but I wasn’t paying for it so why did I care? At the landing the hall made a sharp left, obscuring my vision of the rest of the basement, which wasn’t great to begin with as the only light sources seemed to be oil lamps starting at around 5 feet in. I turned to Cathy for a moment, but once I saw her face I turned back and started walking down. She'd been staring down again, past me.

Children ran between arcade cabinets, parents sipped lukewarm coffee, and the animatronics sang and performed on stage under bright, colorful spotlights. The smell of grease, cake, and old, stained carpet hung in the air like a memory. It was a place meant to bring fantasy, fun, and safety, but behind the cheery music, colorful lights, and the iconic mascots lurked a malicious presence.
Suzie was a bright and trusting seven-year-old girl with a love for animals. She commonly carried around a Chica plush everywhere she went. She often visited Freddy's with her mother, sometimes as an after-school treat. She liked visiting for the various arcade games and to see her favorite character, Chica—a pizza-loving chicken with a small cupcake sidekick—perform on stage along with the rest of the band.
As the performance died down, Suzie rushed over to the arcades to play the various games they had. She found herself playing one of her favorite games, ""Fruity Maze."" After a bit of playing, she caught a glimpse of someone or something in the reflection of the screen. She turned around and found herself face-to-face with a tall yellow rabbit. It wasn’t like any of the other mascots, other than being a rabbit, like Bonnie. The yellow rabbit knelt down in front of her and spoke in a warm voice, ""Hey there, sweetheart. I've got a surprise I want to show you,"" coaxing her to follow him.
Suzie followed. She figured it was just a new character added to the pizzeria. Little did she know he wasn’t supposed to be there. The yellow rabbit brought her to an area she had not explored before. It didn’t seem like a place guests visited, but rather employees. She brushed it off, her curiosity getting the better of her.
The rabbit eventually brought her to a room. It wasn’t very decorated like the main party area or the arcade corner. It was dark and secluded from populated areas. As they both entered, Suzie heard the door close, followed by the sound of it being locked. She looked behind her, finding only the yellow rabbit standing there. Suzie's usual cheery smile faded as she looked around the room, seeing only boxes, wires, and dusty robotic parts.
""I-I think I should go back to my mom now,"" Suzie said, clutching her Chica plush tighter.
""You like Chica, right, honey?"" the yellow rabbit asked, ignoring Suzie's concern. ""If so, I have something very special just for you."" He pointed to something in the room.
""Can I go get my mom first?"" Suzie asked once more, her voice sounding more concerned as she looked over at where the rabbit pointed to find Chica sitting on a table, deactivated. The yellow rabbit slowly approached Suzie.
""She'll see it soon too. You'll want to be ready for when it’s your turn to perform,"" the yellow rabbit said, creeping up on Suzie.
Suzie felt a wave of fear wash over her. ""What do you mean? I just wanna go home!"" she cried, still staring at the motionless animatronic. Suddenly, she felt a sharp pain.

1jujili,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1jujili/how_i_created_a_tsnextjsreactmongo_web_project/,How I Created a TS/NextJS/React/Mongo Web Project with Claude and ~0.001% of My Own Code,"    All ""artifacts"" - the detailed project description, list of implemented features, web links to the working version and GitHub, video of the workflow and interface - are placed at the end of the article.
    
    Recently, I've been unemployed and desperate - wondering what to do next with my strange resume that employers aren't interested in, and generally it seems difficult even for the most professional coders these days - after all, artificial intelligence will soon replace all of us.
    I wrote to my friend asking if anyone in his circle was offering work, and our conversation inspired me to try creating a web project I had long dreamed of, using AI-generated code with minimal, or even without any, coding of my own.
    
    I should mention that although I'm quite good with JS (I even created my own programming language that compiles to JS, similar to CoffeeScript), I know absolutely nothing about TypeScript, NextJS, MongoDB, or even React. I had only a superficial understanding of what Docker is.
    Of course, I tried to ""learn"" React, NextJS, and Mongo, but I never got beyond reading the docs (good thing I'll never have to bother with that again!), so I continued working with Vanilla. For context, I'm a Full Stack developer and stubbornly used PHP for many years, but my last major project was done using NodeJS/Express.
    
    So I embarked on this adventure and decided to create a project I had long envisioned - a visual project manager or planner that allows you to break down projects into tasks and tasks into sub-tasks using AI. You simply specify the name of any project, its description, and receive the tasks that need to be completed to make the project a reality. Any task can also be broken down into sub-tasks. This reduces the hassle of planning - especially for new projects.
    
    Yes, I knew about Cursor and even Windsurf, and later learned about Cline - there's a lot of hype on Twitter about these tools if you follow the right accounts. But something kept me from diving into these technologies, especially considering that for full implementation and goal achievement, you need who knows how much more than $20 for a monthly subscription. So I chose what I liked most at the time - AI from Anthropic, which was also ahead of everyone in coding (now, according to some ratings, it's Gemini 2.5, by the way).
    
    I started working in January and released the production version at the end of March, so all in all it took a little more than 2 months in total, $60, and several hundred (about 400) contextual communications with Claude.
    Initially, it was version 3.5, later 3.7 with Deep Thinking. The difference, I must say, is noticeable. First, 3.5 truncates large bash scripts and large files (yes - I generated files mostly using bash, which allows create several files at once); you have to enter ""Continue"" to continue generating a large bash script or individual file, which is inconvenient because the truncation is often not exactly from the breaking point and happens all the time. Although this drawback is present in 3.7+Thinking, it's not as pronounced, because in the new version with thinking, the response context is much larger.
    
    Claude gives a certain token limit once every 5 hours, so to work effectively in such an environment, I had to set an alarm and wake up at night so as not to lose valuable ""context windows."" If I hadn't done this, it would have added about 2 weeks to the completion time.
    
    Now for the useful part, how exactly you can(?) implement a web project ""of any complexity"" by communicating with any AI that can generate code artifacts.
    
    ## 1. Maximally Detailed Project Description
    The key here is ""maximum details"" and prior planning. Roughly, an additional day of planning, embodied in a detailed description, saves a week of implementation. But even if you start with just a small description - that's acceptable - if you know what to do next. However, if a detailed description isn't provided initially, this will lead to the AI inventing functionality: in some cases, it might be considered useful and appropriate, but sometimes it's something unexpected that can grow into excess and introduce chaos into an already broad structure - as AI tends to ""produce"" more rather than less. Making AI be concise is a difficult task.
    
    ## 2. XML
    Although markdown is also okay, you'll eventually understand that XML is better. In the end, I tried to format almost everything in XML. If you refer to a specific, often nested XML tag in your request, use this syntax: @{leaf of branch of tree}, which will help the AI correctly ""find"" the content of the element <tree><branch><leaf> Content </leaf></branch></leaf>. This query notation @{} was also suggested to me by Claude when I asked how to better work with XML. In general, Claude came up with a large system, which was even called ""programming in XML"", I'll share this chat with Claude https://claude.ai/share/f742bfdf-6e4a-43e9-91ee-208b1243e8c7. The thing is that XML establishes clear boundaries for content parts and allows you to maximally effectively indicate/focus the AI on where to look for what needs to be referenced.
    
    ## 3. Creating and Developing the First Request
    The First Request should be in the form of a highly structured XML template, in the sense that the skeleton of the XML structure will mostly be the same and will be supplemented. I'll provide a generalized skeleton of the XML structure; some elements I later removed, but they were defined initially:
    
    ```xml
    <initial-prompt>
        <metadata>
            Project name, brief description, absolute path to the project directory, database name, database login and password, and so on.    
        </metadata>    
        <project-description>
            Detailed project description in your own words
        </project-description>
        <system>
            Structured transformation of the detailed project description that appeared as a result of a separate request like: ""structure the detailed project description in XML""
        </system>
        <technical-specification>
            Appeared as a result of a separate request like: ""here's a set of desired technologies and technical conditions, project description, structured description - create technical specifications""
        </technical-specification>
        <implementation-hierarchy>
            Appeared as a result of a separate request like: ""here's a set of desired technologies and technical conditions, project description, structured description, technical specifications - create a structure of aspects -> components -> sub-components -> elements in XML""
        </implementation-hierarchy>
        <some-existing-files>
            Some general/technical/configuration files, for example .env, next.config.js, src/middleware.ts
        </some-existing-files>
        <implementation-flow clarification=""used at the stage of creating the component foundation"">
            Division into components: component file structure, interfaces/types, usage examples and integration, tips and purpose.
        </implementation-flow>
        <file-structure>
            XML file structure of a special type of project - not complete files, but paths to files, their purpose, exports and their purpose, usage examples.            
        </file-structure>
        <behavior>
            In 3.5, these were custom instructions for preliminary thinking; also instructions regarding Problem Solving Strategy.    
        </behavior>
        <file-modification-instructions>
            Instructions for ""modification artifacts"" - so that the AI doesn't generate full versions of files, but only information sufficient to change a part: XML modificators.
        </file-modification-instructions>
        <beta-testing clarification=""used in the second stage"">
                Description of beta testing steps with a focus on the uncompleted step <step completed=""false"">
        </beta-testing>
        <updates>
                Description of additions with a focus on the uncompleted addition <update completed=""false"">
        </updates>
        <context-files clarification=""for the second and third stages"">
            Full versions of context files
        </context-files>
        <request>
            The result of the evolution of a large and in turn structured request:
                - How to work with elements of @{initial-prompt}
                - How to create a bash script for generation
                - <important>, <very-important>, <most-important-tips>, <advise>, <necessities>, <before-response>, <before-starting-implementation>, <before-generating-any-file>, <before-implementation-script-generation>, <rules>, <strict-rule>, <logger>
        </request>
        <additional-request with=""real examples"">
            1) Solve issues action-by-action independently; do not mix solutions for several independent issues; 
            2) Read and learn @{context-files}             
        </additional-request>
        <highest-priority-request>
                ...
        </highest-priority-request>
    <initial-prompt>
    ```
    
    ## 4. Implementation Stages
    I managed to divide the implementation into three stages:
    1) Formation of the component foundation. This is the gradual [project-description -> system -> technical-specification -> implementation-hierarchy] transformation of a detailed description into a component structure (which are constituent parts of aspects). With each separate request, you need to refer to the next component with a requirement for its implementation. At the end of the contextual conversation, when all files, including tests, are formed, you need to generalize the work and supplement @{implementation-flow} - this is so that @{initial-prompt} evolves and contains a generalized implementation. During this stage, the static foundation of the project is created. I ended up with 9 aspects.
    2) Beta testing. Although this is not ""beta testing"" in the broad sense, the name for this stage was suggested to me by the AI. This is the stage of dynamic implementation. For me, the first step was ""Enter the first page, go to the registration page, register."" So, one by one, you describe all the steps of the user flow in a structured way. For beta testing, I created a second version of the @{initial-prompt} template, where I referred to each beta testing step for its implementation. In total, I had 25 steps.
    3) Updates. This is when, after deciding that the project is ready for production, you want to add new features. For this, I created a third version of @{initial-prompt}
    
    ## 5. Backups
    Be sure to save achievements after each successful contextual communication with the AI. Without this, it's impossible. I even, besides git, created a custom backuping script, like @backup latest-fixes and @restore latest-fixes with numbering: backups/latest-fixes1, backups/latest-fixes2, ...
    
    ## 6. Vscode Extensions
    List of extensions I created with the help of AI for automation and improvement of the implementation process:
    * File To XML - converts a file path from the clipboard to XML of its content and path to it to the clipboard
    * Files Modificator - makes changes to files from XML modificator from the clipboard
    * Open Created Files - when files are created using a bash script, they open automatically
    * Shell Script Runner - when a sh file is saved, it runs
    * TypeScript Error Collector - collects error hints generated by Vscode/Eslint into an XML structure in the clipboard
    * XML Compressor - compresses XML into a version without spaces/indents between tags
    
    ## The Story of How This Happened in Practice
    When I started, I had no idea what to do. It was logical to create a project description, to summarize thoughts that had been forming over a long time.
    Then the AI transformed the project description into XML. The next thing I did was, based on the available data and an additional request, create a sh script called setup.sh, which generated files for me that allowed running a Docker container with a NextJS/MongoDB project. (Of course, this didn't work on the first try, but on the... third(?) attempt, meaning I started working on the project implementation 3 times).
    We started generating files for the first components, and I realized that I needed to supplement @{initial-prompt}, so I added @{implemenetation-flow of initial-prompt}, where I placed generalized information about created files (and corresponding capabilities) of the component.
    Even before Claude 3.7 appeared, I created a custom instruction where I indicated to the AI <thinking> before each response. This improved efficiency. To improve efficiency, I also applied several other self-invented methods.
    To @{implementation-hierarchy} I added <tree> of this type:
    Core Infrastructure
    ├──System Logging
    │  └──Logger System
    │     ├──LoggerConfiguration
    │     └──LoggerInstance
    To save on context size, before each start of component implementation, I first added already completed aspects->components in @{implementation-hierarchy} and the current component to be executed, and secondly, later began to remove some components that clearly didn't relate to the currently implemented component.
    Later, with the appearance of Claude 3.7, the problem of context size became less critical, but over time, as the project grew, this problem gradually became more acute, so it was necessary to constantly review what to remove from @{initial-prompt}, what to make more efficiently shortened.
    Often you have to transfer context - this is because the size of the context window of one conversation is 200k tokens. It ends suddenly. To transfer, you need to create a separate XML structured request that should summarize the progress of the current context for continuation in the next one.
    Jest tests were created for each component, so the conclusion of component implementation was Jest testing. I didn't delve into the details of what exactly the tests should be, and in vain. In practice, most of the real testing work was done during beta testing in the form: the AI creates *additional to existing* files related to the beta testing step action (for example, user registration), I try to register, if it doesn't work - I describe what exactly, the AI creates new versions of files - and so on in a circle. You constantly have to collect errors that Vscode hints at and iteratively achieve an error-free appearance of files. But besides these preliminary errors, there are also implementation errors/problems - to fix them, you need to describe the problem in detail. If the problem isn't solved, I either try to divide the problem into parts, or restart the context, describing the problem in the defining request already in more detail with the experience of solving it taken into account. Some complex problems were solved on the first try, but some seemingly simple ones - over several days.
    The most difficult task is to get the AI to not generate unnecessary code. Initially, I had a lot of unnecessary code created, but over time, when I learned how to work, I understood how to prepare the defining request, which context files to choose, how to choose them.
    During beta testing, I came to create @{file-structure}. At the end of work on the beta testing action, using a special request, I ask the AI to form a portion of the newly created file structure, which I add to the file-structure.xml file, then using a separate script (created, like all others, with the help of AI) I process file-structire.xml into file-structure-extracted.xml, trying to discard XML structures of files that are not needed for the context. Sometimes I directly ask, through a separate request, which files to take for the next context from the full file structure.
    There is a difference between @{file-structure} and @{context-files}. @{file-structure} contains not full files, but file paths, descriptions of the purpose/application of files, a list of their exports and usage examples. Meanwhile, @{context-files} are full files, often *intended* for the next context. In @{request}, I ask the AI before starting work, each time to evaluate the available context files and structure files and suggest additional files that might be needed for the most effective implementation of the task.
    
    ## Logger
    The first component the AI proposed to create was a logger, which is a reworked console.log, for typing messages [info/warn/error/debug]. This is useful because the AI itself forms the necessary information for logs, which had to be copied and pasted into the context from time to time to solve problems. It's worth using such a logger, rather than the standard one, because it can be supplemented. And there is a lot to supplement. For example, over time I understood how to improve logging:
    1) Add styling. Although this is in the standard ones, the defining logger created by the AI didn't have this.
    2) Add keywords. Along with the logger.config.json file, this allowed creating the ability to filter logs by keywords. This is very useful because over time there will be a lot of logs, for example, in my case, possibly 30% of all code in files relates to logs. Although I specified ""more logs"" in the request, but to have so many... Therefore, to provide only the necessary logs, the third argument in my loggers is a list of keywords; I edit logger.config.json, indicating which keywords I need to display logs for now. I'll say that the log filtering function that is in the browser is not enough.
    3) Add technical information about the log file and the line number of the call. In general, the second argument - the object to output can be supplemented with technical/optional ""features"".
    
    ## Tips
    * If you don't understand why the AI isn't following your instructions and this confuses you and you ""give up"" - don't be sad. Just add the instruction that the AI ignores to the <request> again, preferably in other words, preferably framed in a different tag, like <very-strict-rule>. It's the repetition of instructions that increases attention to them and their weight. Tag names matter.
    * Have patience! If after numerous attempts the AI still can't perform a task or solve a problem - take a break and try to rethink the request, break the problem down into component parts and solve them gradually. Avoid trying to solve several problems simultaneously if you're not sure the AI can solve them (with experience, intuition starts to work in this direction). Don't rely completely on the AI, understand the problem/task/question yourself - this will help rethink. Find what is the source/origin of the problem, let the AI analyze it. Let it remake the files from scratch, even if this leads to the loss of secondary functionality. Repeat attempts until the problem is solved - this always works.
    * Keep track of which files relate to which aspect/component. You can create a separate file in which to associate aspects/components or steps/actions of beta testing with a list of corresponding files. This will help quickly resume work in a certain context.
    * Rebuild your thinking. Working with AI, you become like a manager, and the AI - the executor. For success, you need to move away from ""coder thinking"", that is, not to consider the project from the point of view of how you will implement the code. The main skills now become the ability to see the interconnected-whole (holistic view) and the ability to describe what you want to implement.
    
    ## Thoughts About the Future
    Do you need to learn this? After some time, perhaps very soon, or perhaps only after a couple of years, a software project of any complexity can be performed by communicating with AI. Most likely, coding will no longer be for any human (except for some eccentrics). After all, no one multiplies even two-digit numbers without a calculator, right? Is it worth jumping right into this moment: yesterday you were still writing code, and today AI is coding what you describe in your own words. Without a smooth transition? Maybe some will succeed, but the transition path carries risks of losses - not everyone will ""survive"". After all, now one person will be able to do more work than 10 (roughly speaking). So, perhaps it is worth starting to train to interact with AI, because this skill will become the main one for everyone in the future. After this work, I got the feeling that I achieved something very necessary, perhaps not so pronounced now, when the transition is just beginning, but its outlines on the horizon of the future appear with inevitable certainty, waves of transformation force spread a significant influence even on the present time.
    
    ## What Am I Interested in Now?
    I would like to teach interaction with AI - what I learned myself during this project - both to development teams and individually.
    I'm interested in interacting with an enterprising and promising individual to implement a startup; interested in performing a very complex project using AI on order.
    The most exciting thought is to participate in a startup that would deal with the task of fully automating interaction with AI to create web projects.
    
    ## AI Project Planner description.
    - user will be defined by nickname and password, so the home page for the new user will be text-field asking to sign-up or sign-in. user data for auto sign-in and continue session will be stored in localStorage, while user's password with nickname will be stored on backend database;
    - when user signed in, this would be initially a plane area with text field offering to name and describe the project;
    - when user sends a project name and description, it transferred with chosen ai api (openai by default) on frontend, requesting AI to split a described project to separate tasks. ai api is requested directly, not through backend;
    - frontend receives these tasks and build svg structure: on the center of screen is rectangle with project name/description; from center rectangle arrows are drawn to other rectangles that are evenly distributed around the project rectangle, in each rectangle a description of a task appears. each task rectangle has a tangent icon, clicking on which the request is sent to the ai api which splits this task into tasks and return to the frontend. such prompt indicates parent chain of tasks up to project included for understanding context;
    - when task is expanded: task rectangle itself, its child tasks and arrows to them remains visible; arrow from parent project/task rectangle and parent project/task rectangle become half-transparent and put on lower layer; all others svg elements become invisible; child tasks rectangles appeared around task's rectangle with arrows to them from the task (similary like for project -> tasks). such functionality is the same for every ask: task is also can by expanded to its children tasks in similar way;
    - if user click on already previously expanded task or project rectangle, nothing sent to ai api, its children tasks received from backend and hidden/half-transparent rule for svg elements is the same;
    - task rectangle which has children tasks has tangent icon which shows number of direct children and all descendant tasks;
    - name is extracted from project description as - or the first sentence neither the first line on the text;
    - when project's direct children tasks received, existing project data (these tasks specifically) is stored to backend. when a task's children tasks are received - they stored on backend;
    - children rectangles always distributed evenly around parent's rectangle, center of each child rectangle should be on the same distance to centers of nearest/neighbour subling rectangles and distance from center of each child rectangle to center of parent rectangle should be equal to each other. child rectangles should not intersect. distance from parent task/project to task should be defined dynamically, which depends on quantity of children tasks;
    - if text of task is too long, there should be reasonable maximum height of rectangle. width of a rectangle should have also reasonable maximum width;
    - if full text is not fit rectangle size, there is ""show more"" icon shown - when user clicks on such rectangle - it increased to bottom in size and full text is shown;
    - user can move working 2D area by dragging it to all directions (like it realized on maps);
    - zoom is not necessary for this version;
    - system will be designed for further use with any ai api, but initially it will be used with openai api;
    - the backend will be used to store a project data, with it's tasks for the user;
    - the working area, which named ""desk"" or ""deck"" (choose more appropriate), will have fixed pane on the left side with icon on the top left which opens/close this pane, there will be one icon-button when pressed is opened window with text-field, where user put their openai api key which stored in localStorage and will be used for the ai api;
    - task could be regenerated: for this another tangent icon is located on task rectangle; by pushing it, all children tasks hierarchy are removed and with special prompt via ai api is requested text of the new task. in such prompt indicated parent chain of tasks up to project included and sibling tasks, text of current task is not generated and asked to generate one more additional task to sibling tasks
    - task could be deleted: for this another tangent icon is located on task rectangle, by pushing it, all children tasks hierarchy are removed; 
    - before task to be regenerated, user asked to approve regeneration request;
    - on regeneration and removal db and ui are refreshed respectivelly;
    - on the side pane there is icon which opens window where user can choose a project from the list of their projects. when user chooses project it's structure is loaded from backend. when a project is loaded, project's rectangle is shown along with direct child tasks and arrows to them on the center of the screen;
    - projects and tasks are not public and visible only to user who created/own them.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1jujgm2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jujgm2,"New diagnosis, worried and confused","Hi, I was dx with PCV by my PCP and referred to oncology based on high HGB, HCT, RBC, and platelets. I have a family history of PCV but tested negative for JAK1. New bloodwork showed all of the above high plus MCH and MCV. 
However, my iron is normal and ferritin is high. 

The oncologist said if I was negative for JAK1 (and I was) then she will order a bone marrow biopsy. I see her on the 11th. My mom also did that and she says it was awful and negative. Her PCV was treated with phlebotomy and never recurred so I really want to try that but the oncologist wants to do a full diagnostic workup first. She said mine was mild and I'd be fine, no chemo at this point but I could take aspirin if I felt like it. I don't know if she was being dismissive or reassuring but it had the vibe of reassurance not that I was being a baby. 

I'm often extremely tired. That's the worst of it - tired, dizzy, shaky. I am also diabetic, menopausal, and a federal employee who just lost her job. So there's way too much going on. Way way WAY too much. 

If I'm JAK1 negative this is secondary and maybe not primary lifelong PCV, yes?

Most things I eat taste terribly oversalted. It has to have salt in it (doesn't affect yogurt or milk, or coffee, plain fruits and veg). Has anyone else experienced this? 

I will work on extra hydration. 

When they took five vials of blood I actually felt way better for about a week. I don't know if it's related, it's not a lot of blood. My mom did phlebotomy for 3 months and it totally cleared up her bloodwork. I don't want months of tests before this is allowed. Oncologist says it's dangerous to do it now because of possible clots and throwing a clot and stroking. 

My test results are attached. I see the oncologist again on Thursday. What questions should I ask? Should I really strenuously advocate for phlebotomy? 

I'm low enough that I think (not sure) I could donate at Red Cross but I haven't done that because I'm trying to be helpful and compliant and not mess up her science. 

I really like the doctor. It is is what it is on long waits between appointments. I'm not complaining about that, I feel incredibly blessed and lucky to have PCV and not something aggressively malignant. Going to the oncology center was deeply humbling. I'd been feeling exhausted but I'm going to be OK. Even if I just have to live with it, I'll be OK.

1jujfvz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jujfvz,Let’s Make Some Drinks #3: The Roscoe,"Here’s an original cocktail of mine, I’m calling the Roscoe. Named for a sweet Russian Blue that recently passed. It is a gingerbread inspired milk punch for the holidays, with some extra steps for those of you that like to do infusions. Bear with me because I know this is a long post.
Making this kind of drink isn’t for everyone, but I have had fun branching out from the basic recipes that I’ve found here on Reddit.

Recipe I Used:
- [x] 8oz oz brown butter rum*
- [x] 10oz spiced bourbon*
- [x] 2.5 oz Cinnamon syrup*
- [x] 1 oz Benedictine
- [x] 4oz lemon juice
- [x] 6oz fresh Pineapple juice
- [x] 6oz apple cider
- [x] 9.5 oz speculoos and spice milk

Winter Spiced Whiskey:
Rest for a week (shaking daily) then strain out the solids
- Roughly 1.5 cups whiskey (I used Woodford)
- One big chunk of ginger peeled and diced
- 3 cardamom pods 
- 1 cinnamon stick (only steep for 2-3 days)
- 1 chai tea bag - steep for 8-12 hours
- 3 peppercorns
- 5 Allspice berries
- 4 cloves

Brown Butter Rum:
- 1 cup Appleton Estate 8
- 1 cup Pussers
- 1 stick of butter, browned slowly over medium low heat
Put in a jar and freeze
Strain off the congealed fat and you’re good to go!
I used a similar process to this recipe here:
https://chefspencerwatts.com/the_recipes/butter-bourbon/
(It also makes a killer rum old fashioned)

Cinnamon Syrup:
Anders Erikson’s recipe

Speculoos Milk:
Combine 1/4-1/2 cup more milk than you’ll need with about half a sleeve of Speculoos or gingerbread cookies. Let them break down and steep in the fridge for about an hour. Strain out the cookie bits.

Preparation:
- Combine all ingredients except for the milk and stir
- Slowly pour the punch into the milk
- Let that “lager” in the fridge for at least an hour or up to 24 hours
- My setup that has been working well is a nut milk bag nestled into two coffee filters. It can take a long time, but results in a pretty clear solution with just one pass (once the sediment has settled into the filters)
- (I tried to post a picture of the setup above)
- Once it is clear, bottle it up (the straining process can take hours)
- Serve over clear ice with a dusting of fresh ground nutmeg

For serving:
- Use clear ice for the best effect
- Pour 3-4 oz into your glass
- Top with freshly grated nutmeg

Notes:
- The milk-washing process mutes most flavors except sweet. The stronger your other starting flavors the better.
- Taking a big sip and letting it coat the palette allows the ginger and cinnamon to really come through.
- If I make it again, I’ll probably up the amount of spices used in the infusion
- The nutmeg on top is a must.
- Typing it out I realized how ambitious this one was…but it was worth it
- I only used the Benedictine because I was a little short on cinnamon simple syrup
- Infusing the milk is just another way to get flavors into the cocktail. Read more here: https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/encyclopedia/2836/au/cocktails
- I would classify this more as a refreshing holiday punch, than a hearty winter warmer

-Time consuming cocktails
-Anything with that slightly sweet holiday vibe

1jujfp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1jujfp6/basic_memory_localfirst_knowledge_graph_for_ai/,Basic Memory: Local-first knowledge graph for AI conversations with complete data ownership,"Hey r/opensource,

I've built Basic Memory, an open-source tool that creates a persistent knowledge graph for AI conversations while keeping all data as standard Markdown files on your computer.

**The problem it solves:**

Most AI conversations are ephemeral - you have a chat, get an answer, and everything disappears. When you return, you repeat yourself constantly. Existing solutions often involve proprietary formats, cloud storage, or complex setups that take your data out of your control.

Basic Memory solves this by creating a knowledge graph from standard Markdown files that both you and AI assistants like Claude can read and write to.

**How it works:**

    # Coffee Brewing Methods
    
    ## Observations
    - [method] Pour over provides more clarity and highlights subtle flavors
    - [technique] Water temperature at 205°F (96°C) extracts optimal compounds
    - [principle] Freshly ground beans preserve aromatics and flavor
    
    ## Relations
    - relates_to [[Coffee Bean Origins]]
    - requires [[Proper Grinding Technique]]
    - affects [[Flavor Extraction]]

The system extracts semantic meaning from simple patterns and builds a traversable knowledge graph. All data remains in plain text files you can edit with any editor (works great with Obsidian!).

**Workflow:**

1. Chat normally with AI assistant
2. Ask ""Create a note about our conversation""
3. In future chats, say ""Let's continue our discussion about X""
4. AI retrieves relevant context and continues where you left off

**Key features:**

* Fully open source (AGPL-3.0)
* Local-first architecture with complete data ownership
* Uses Model Context Protocol to connect with AI assistants
* Bi-directional sync between knowledge graph and filesystem
* Simple Markdown storage that humans can easily read/edit
* Automatic relationship extraction without complex templates
* Works with Claude Desktop (and other MCP-compatible systems, VSCode, Cursor, etc)

**Tech stack:**

* Python backend with SQLite for indexing
* Async-first architecture with comprehensive test coverage
* File-first approach (files are the source of truth)
* Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)

From the taker of copious \*Stupid little walks for my stupid mental health\*, I bring you this silly little post for my silly mental health. Available right now, on a phone in front of your face.







I’ve done a fair bit of thinking over the past months, and I realised I’ve mostly been living life on autopilot. Get up, work late, cook, eat, read or game, and repeat. When family or coworkers ask me what I’ve been up to, I don't really have anything to share.  I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few months have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I’m actually lonely.







I’m hoping this post here can be a bit of a kick-start to my social life. I’m not picky about how, whether it be real-life friends, virtual friends, texting buddies; I’m open for pretty much anything! I want to get off that autopilot life, so I’m looking for someone to share my thoughts and experiences with, and who wants to share their thoughts and experiences with me. Let’s ask each other meaningful or meaningless questions. Let’s talk about random crap, or about important things. Let’s share our life experiences, our passions, or what we’re having for dinner. Let’s share photo’s of the world around us, and about our place in that world. I like to think of myself as curious, open-minded and inclusive, so please, broaden my horizons!







You don’t have to be into the same stuff as me, but I’ll share a bit about myself just so that you know who you’d be talking to. I used to prefer coffee over tea, but am slowly starting to prefer tea. I thoroughly enjoy living in a city, but my ideal vacation is travelling to remote places and spending my days hiking or biking. I prefer paperbacks over hardcover books. I love muddling around in the kitchen. I own more watches than any sane person should. I’m a former fit person who got fat, and is trying (but so far failing) to get fit again.







I have struggled massively with my mental health, and even though things are much better now, I continue to be in therapy. I’m just sharing this because I think it’s good to acknowledge the things I struggle with, and to show that I’m open-minded concerning personal battles.










LGBTQ+ friendly.

John was still fuming as he followed the cart back to town, his eyes burning a hole in the back of Rin's head between checking the surrounding forest for threats. Strangely, the woman who had threatened to cut him down a mere hour ago was… surprisingly pliant after he exploded at her, although he still wasn't sure if she actually felt guilty or if there was *something else* beyond his understanding at work. It was almost creepy how quiet Rin was; she had hardly said a word since they had left the noodle shop.

His head twinged, and he grimaced. It had been a few years since he got so mad he got a tension headache, but it seemed Rin really knew how to bring out the worst in him.

Well, at least the extra muscle helped. John wouldn't have wanted to haul that cart full of planks, tools, and whatnot, especially since it would probably expose his lack of superstrength that seemed typical amongst the magical here, and he'd feel *awful* about getting someone else to do it. Part of him still felt weirded out by Rin knowing where he lived, but given that she knew about his most recent *encounters* with the local tax collectors, she could just locate one of them to press for where he lived.

While he would have preferred to keep the location of his home entirely secret, fate had other plans. Besides, if it was some unfindable cave in the woods somewhere, not only would he have probably lost it himself, but Yuki would have likely never found it. She might have remembered the rough location, but given how much could change in however many years she was imprisoned…

He hated to admit it, but despite all the pains her presence had caused him, he wasn't fool enough to deny that her arrival gave him a chance to improve his lot.

What's done was done, in any case. Some small part of John was worried about how Rin spat up blood when Yuki struck her, but both seemed relatively unbothered, so he put it out of his mind. It was probably some bullshit Unbound durability thing, much like how Yuki could walk around with a good chunk of her leg gone.

""So, that's what you're like when you're angry,"" Yuki trilled. ""I never would have thought it.""

""What do you mean by that?"" he asked, tearing his gaze away from their attacker to the disguised kitsune by his side.

""Your voice. I expected cold fury from you, but that? You nail 'angry but mostly disappointed father' rather well,"" Yuki teased, a grin spreading across her face.

""I guess… that's just how it is now,"" John replied with a frown. ""Back home, I used to just get screaming mad and then shut down."" Several years of late-night gaming binges of the most infuriating PvP games on the market proved that… and might have caused it, now that he thought of it. Hmm. ""Maybe a few years in the woods made me *more* reasonable, as crazy as it seems.""

She laughed, light and airy, without that characteristic vulpine gekker thanks to her disguise. ""Well, perhaps in a few months, the village-folk will know who to go to if they need a gaggle of children brought into line.""

""*Please,* no,"" he groaned, shaking his head. ""I'm awful with kids. If anyone is stupid enough to leave their child with me, I'm *caffeinating* them to the gills and teaching them to swear in both languages I know.""

She narrowed her eyes at him. ""I haven't taught you any swears yet.""

""I have time to study up from the local bars or gambling dens before you find any random local children to dump on me,"" he flatly stated.

Yuki laughed. ""What is *caffeinating*, anyhow? You slipped into your native tongue there,"" she asked.

John tensed and his eyes immediately snapped to Rin, but the dragon woman was still pulling the cart without giving any indication she was listening in. He supposed that, even if she was, it wasn't exactly a grand revelation that he was foreign; you just had to look at him.

""It's the verb related *caffeine,* a noun,"" John explained, but he took a moment to figure out how best to describe it without leaning on other English words. ""You know how some teas made with certain plants can energize you?"" At her nod, he continued. ""*Caffeine* is what does it. What precisely it does is hard to explain and not my specialty, but I think plants have it in them to keep insects away. It's just a happy coincidence that it gives nice bursts of energy.""

Yuki's head tilted a bit, looking thoughtful. ""And it melts in water like sugar,"" she slowly responded, ""which is why boiling the right leaves causes it to take on those properties, yes?""

John gave her a thumbs up, and after a moment of the kitsune staring at the unfamiliar gesture, he awkwardly realized that the gesture didn't exist here, and his hand slowly dropped back down to his side. ""Something like that. *Caffeine* is water-*soluble*, meaning it dissolves in water, but I never really gave it too much thought beyond it working*.* I practically lived off the stuff at one point.""

""Really now?"" Yuki asked, although it felt more rhetorical than anything. ""Perhaps I should be asking you for some tea tips.""

""*Nah.*"" He huffed in English, looking off into the woods for any threats. ""I was more of a *coffee* guy. The *caffeine* withdrawals sucked something fierce when I first got ported here. Before you ask, it's a bit like tea, but you make it with a device that slowly pours water over these roasted and ground-up beans in a filter, and then it drips into a weird pot you pour from. I think it tends to be stronger than most teas, *caffeine*\-wise. Bit bitter, but you can solve that easily.""

""I see. If I happen across any *coffee* beans, would you do me the favour of preparing some?"" Yuki asked, turning to look him in the eyes.

Hesitantly, John turned her look and nodded. ""Sure. I make no promises it'll be good even if you find some, though. Back home, most of the work is done for you by the time you buy it, and even then, the device does about nine-tenths of the rest. You get them out of small bright red fruit, and the beans have two lobes and are coloured light tan.""

She clicked her tongue, looking off into the distance. ""It doesn't sound familiar,"" she admitted after a moment of silence. ""I'll keep an eye out, though, and if I see these mystical beans, I'll let you know.""

The conversation lost steam, and they drifted into companionable silence. John only noticed afterwards how less *angry* he was than a few minutes prior and sighed deeply. 

Well played, Yuki.

He turned his gaze back to the dragon woman out front, keeping a careful eye on her as they walked back into town. The atmosphere was tenser than before. Sure, before, people cleared out of their way, but now they were *hurried* about it, getting out of the way of their group like they were a speeding car. Was it directed at Rin? Him? Yuki? All of them? Did it even matter? They still quieted in their wake, like insects caught in the shadow of some great predator.	

He knew that if he was just some random person living his life and heard about a brawl between three superpowered strangers who showed up a few days ago, he wouldn't care too much about who started it. It was just a miracle that nobody was hurt during that brawl.

It felt like whatever little progress he made in ingratiating himself was instantly eroded, and his face fell into a sullen frown. There would be other chances, he hoped, once things stabilized a bit and the Nameless were dealt with. Of course, assuming the town was still here.

He hated to admit it, but if they pressed the Nameless population too hard without having a killing blow at the ready, they might decide to strike out against the town itself for an influx of wealth to counter, and they'd go through the place like a hot knife through butter. That was unacceptable.

John didn't doubt that Yuki would have reached the same conclusion before him, though, and she would have likely raised the issue with his starvation plan if she thought it might cause such an event.

Before he could muse much further, they returned to the ruined diner, guilt eating at the bottom of his stomach once more. ""Right. Please put the cart out front, Rin. Rear end pointed to the entrance, please,"" he ordered. Despite everything, it still smelled much like it did before, even if there was a faint hint of sawdust.

""So it shall be!"" she loudly declared, speaking up for the first time since her defeat, but there was still some brittleness to her voice, like she might crack at any moment. She quickly obeyed, eagerly maneuvering the cart into position before laying it down. What was *with* that woman? Whatever, at least she had her energy back because this would take a while.

Granny Porridge—he really had to learn her real name, referring to her as that even internally felt awkward to him—hobbled out of the back. She eyed the three of them up, before giving a positively withering glare to Rin, who withered slightly under the attention. ""It's nice to see the two of you again,"" she said, smiling sweetly.

""Again, we're *so* sorry about this,"" John replies, wincing as one of the damaged tables collapsed in two halves, seemingly taking their presence as a signal to finally give up the ghost. It was a small mercy that neither of them went wild, throwing magical effects everywhere. Otherwise, the damage would have been more extensive. As bad as it looked, most of these boards would be easily replaced, and many of the things that weren't were still intact enough for him to weld together, using a bit of filler material if needed.

It was a small mercy that the damage to the walls seemed to be far away from anything load-bearing.

""I'm just happy you're helping fix things!"" she exclaimed. ""Most Unbound wouldn't do that, you know? Most of the 'righteous' ones that wouldn't just write it off as part of justice getting done would just send some coin over and be done with it. Do you need anything?""

""No. Thank you, though,"" John affirmed, and the old lady wandered away into the back, out of sight.

John flipped the tailgate down on the trailer, reached in, grabbed one of the crowbars he packed, and held it out. ""Rin? Please use this to tear the damaged floorboards and wall panels out,"" he requested.

The woman in question *quickly* walked over with a surprising spring in her step, snagging the tool from his hand before jogging over to the place where Yuki punched her into the floor and started to pry the boards free. Seriously, what the hell was wrong with her? It probably wasn't his problem, and at least she was helpful, but it still bugged the hell out of him.

Still, she went to work enthusiastically, tearing out the damaged boards with ease that he honestly should have expected. Damned Unbound strength. Crouching down by a cleaved table, he maneuvered the two halves into place, starting to weld it. Still, it was awkward, and he had to keep shifting it to keep it from slipping. While the hardening process was fast, it wasn't instant, and John had to pick up various bits of shrapnel to fill the empty spaces from lost material. It was slow and steady work. 

A presence settled beside him, and he glanced at Yuki's smiling disguise. ""And how might I help, Lord Hall?"" There was a mild bite in how she pronounced his name, but—Oh. *Ohhhhh.* He was in trouble, wasn't he? Her ""Yumi"" disguise was kind of going around calling him by his first name, wasn't it? That was probably a pretty big breach of decorum. Still, why now? She had plenty of time to bring it up on the way over or when they were inside gathering stuff up—Obviously, Rin waited outside for *that,* at least. 

""Ah,"" he started, sheepishly smiling. ""Would you mind holding this?"" John gestured to the flipped-over table he was awkwardly handling, and she nodded, crouching down to help. A second set of hands made the job *much* easier, and the first table was fixed quickly. From there, all he had to do was scrape the excess material off, but that was easy with the vaguely magical chisel he brought along.

Before he invented this tool, he would have expected this to take *days*, but as it was, they were blazing along. The work of hours took minutes, and although they didn't look *exactly* like prior, the furniture was certainly *functional* at a bare minimum. Maybe Granny Porridge could use it as a marketing gimmick, claiming she had unique Unbound-made furniture with techniques impossible to replicate by mortal hands. At least, that was what he'd do, and he knew if he was a carpenter back home, he'd be positively boggled looking at the alien things the grains were doing here, so it might even work.

Soon enough, they were done with the furniture. The room still looked like the inside of a washing machine after someone tossed a brick in it, granted… not that John would know from experience.

""Lord Hall, I'm done!"" loudly proclaimed a voice, and when he looked over, sure enough, Rin was standing by a rather large stack of boards. Most might as well have been halfway to pulp, and he was sure that most of them were *more* intact than that when he last checked. He guessed that would teach him to give someone with superstrength a crowbar and tell them to remove something without further instructions.

 Now that he looked at those boards, though, very few nails were in them, held in place previously by rather impressive joinery… which he definitely did not have the skill to properly emulate. A bucket of screws it was. 

Figuring out how to make those sucked, and it certainly wasn't how they were done back home, but it was *absolutely* worth it.

""Oh, excellent!"" John stood up after flipping the last table back into place with Yuki. It was a small mercy that everyone here favoured kneeling on the ground over using chairs. Otherwise, they would have had so much more work to do. Ugh, if they actually hit something load-bearing, he would have had to figure out a way to shim it up while he repaired it, and that would be—

Well, there wasn't too much point in dwelling on it.

He grabbed one of the planks, placed it in one of the holes, and, noting it was close enough in size to work like his initial measurements suggested, nodded, measured the length, and marked the extra with a pencil and everywhere it would have to be screwed down underneath. ""Hey, Yuk—I mean, Yumi? Could you use the saw to cut off the last section I've marked at the end?"" 

She wordlessly nodded in agreement, grabbing the saw and plank from the back and going to work. Normally, John would just use the table saw, but if there was anything that would give him away as not actually doing his magic, it'd be that, so he left it at home. At least he had his gauntlet for drilling.

""And for me?"" asked Rin, who stood at stiff attention to the side.

John handed her the bucket of screws, keeping the screwdriver for himself for a minute as Yuki handed the plank back to him.

Curiously, she held one of the meaty screws, marvelling. ""Such craftsmanship…"" she trailed off. ""So uniform, too!"" She palmed another one, comparing them. ""These must have taken hours to do!""

He shrugged. The process was easy when you could turn metal into a gel-like consistency and then run it across a thread-rolling die. Hell, he had the process mostly automated, given the amount he could go through on a big project.

""They're nothing special,"" John insisted with a shrug as he set the plank down on some debris to keep it level. From there, he put his gauntlet over one of the marked spaces, carefully positioned his fingers to make his drill-like focus *very* small, and excavated a small pilot hole before putting the wood in place and screwing the fastener in until it was level with the floor. ""Do you think you can manage to do that?"" Obviously, she *could*, but whether she'd manage to not split the board was another matter entirely.

""Yes, my lord!"" Rin eagerly replied, taking the screwdriver. Everything went… surprisingly well from there. Rin's long, sinewy tail swayed behind her as she focused on working, putting nearly as much energy and enthusiasm into it as fighting. Yuki did her work quickly and precisely, sawing planks with inhuman precision in seconds and grabbing the next plank as he and Rin worked.

He almost forgot what working on a project like this with others was like. Despite the circumstances, it was soothing, in a way. He lost himself in the drilling and marking, zoning out entirely, even as he took the occasional downtime to weld the edges of the planks that Rin had placed to stop draft—Shit, he could have just welded everything in place. Well, it's too late now, and this would stop warping, anyhow.

He probably should be more worried about Rin deciding to attack him… but he doubted, weakened as she was, she could pound through his warding fast enough. John grimly knew that if she tried, Rin would be a red smear in short order, although Yuki *might* blow her cover in doing so.

To his surprise, the walls were only slightly more difficult than the floor, but he supposed that was what happened when you had two people with superhuman strength and coordination helping out.

After all that, he stood back, basking in the glow of a job well done, surveying the room for anything else… but they were done. All that was left was to sweep up.

""Good work,"" he said, gathering some excess scrap and loading it back into the cart. After all, it wasn't as if he wouldn't find *some* use for it. Some sections were intact enough to use for small things, and much of the rest would make good fuel for fires. They weren't lacquered boards, just waxed, so they shouldn't throw off a bunch of toxic smoke.

""Thank you for your forgiveness, Lord Hall; I've learned much today!"" Rin hurriedly spoke, falling onto her knees and bowing low to the ground enough that her forehead touched it.

He blinked in utter bafflement. ""Really now?""

""Yes; your beneficence knows no bounds!"" She really didn't have an off switch, huh? ""First, your harsh—but true—lesson about my carelessness, then your raw care for regular mortals, then the little ways you used magic… I was paying attention.""

John looked at Yuki, entirely baffled by this absurd cryptid who had, unfortunately, stumbled into his life. Her face was quirked up, her expression somewhere between realizing she had stepped in something filthy and someone realizing a report was due on Monday after a weekend of trying to forget about work. Thankfully, Rin was too busy bowing and scraping to notice.

""The way you use your ki is absolutely inspiring!"" Rin continued praising him. ""Where a lesser person would use a bonfire, you use a candle to accomplish the same."" Oh, shit, she was watching him closely while he was drilling the holes, wasn't she?

""It would bring this humble Nagahama Rin great joy if you were to teach her! I'd be your sword and do whatever you wish!""

…What?

From the taker of copious \*Stupid little walks for my stupid mental health\*, I bring you this silly little post for my silly mental health. Available right now, on a phone in front of your face.







I’ve done a fair bit of thinking over the past months, and I realised I’ve mostly been living life on autopilot. Get up, work late, cook, eat, read or game, and repeat. When family or coworkers ask me what I’ve been up to, I don't really have anything to share.  I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few months have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I’m actually lonely.







I’m hoping this post here can be a bit of a kick-start to my social life. I’m not picky about how, whether it be real-life friends, virtual friends, texting buddies; I’m open for pretty much anything! I want to get off that autopilot life, so I’m looking for someone to share my thoughts and experiences with, and who wants to share their thoughts and experiences with me. Let’s ask each other meaningful or meaningless questions. Let’s talk about random crap, or about important things. Let’s share our life experiences, our passions, or what we’re having for dinner. Let’s share photo’s of the world around us, and about our place in that world. I like to think of myself as curious, open-minded and inclusive, so please, broaden my horizons!







You don’t have to be into the same stuff as me, but I’ll share a bit about myself just so that you know who you’d be talking to. I used to prefer coffee over tea, but am slowly starting to prefer tea. I thoroughly enjoy living in a city, but my ideal vacation is travelling to remote places and spending my days hiking or biking. I prefer paperbacks over hardcover books. I love muddling around in the kitchen. I own more watches than any sane person should. I’m a former fit person who got fat, and is trying (but so far failing) to get fit again.







I have struggled massively with my mental health, and even though things are much better now, I continue to be in therapy. I’m just sharing this because I think it’s good to acknowledge the things I struggle with, and to show that I’m open-minded concerning personal battles.










LGBTQ+ friendly.

My Mum died a few years ago very quickly from cancer. My Mum and Dad were together for about 35 years. After her death my Dad really struggled on his own, partly because my Mum did everything for him. 

In December 2024 he started to post pictures with my Mums best friend and him on Facebook and in our family chats. I found this really weird as he had never spoken to me about her or mentioned anything at all. 

I asked him if he was in a relationship with her and he denied it. Even went as far as gaslighting me and calling me crazy for asking that. A few weeks later he then confessed that they were dating. I asked why he lied to me and told him I found it quite disrespectful. It might have been an uncomfortable conversation but I don’t believe in lying to your own daughter. 

Anyway the past year I noticed major changes in my Dad. He barely contacts me, won’t come round to my house and is always busy and never seems to have time for me. If I want to see him, I have to go over to his house. It just feels like a one way street. I’ve brought this up numerous times and he acknowledges it but never changes or seems to try harder. 

I then found out he had been seeing this woman way longer than I initially thought, almost a year. It makes sense with him distancing himself from me. 

It just seems like he’s attached himself onto her and what’s even weirder is she was my Mums friend. I’ve told him it makes me uncomfortable because I can’t lie but I’ll support him if it makes him happy. 

He takes her to all the same places he took my Mum and post photos all over social media. It makes me feel uncomfortable. He’s bought her the exact same clothes he bought my Mum and she accepts them. Like hiking jackets etc. 

He keeps saying that he wants me to go out for coffee with her but I’ve politely told him I don’t want to get too invested in a ‘four month’ relationship and that I’m not ready just yet. 

Just wondering if I’m being difficult or if I’m justified in not wanting to make more of an effort with her just yet? ",2,1744133127.0,ChildrenofDeadParents,1,1.0,False

I am a fan of journaling and meditation, but wanted to share several other strategies I've found work for me and hope they might work for you too:

  
1. Cars + Music: I love singing in the car. I love driving around just letting myself think. If I've had a stressful day or feel stuck, I'll find time to take a drive and turn on some music to listen/sing to. 

  
2. Writing lyrics / poems: I've always enjoyed songs that have lyrics I can relate to deeply and so took up the hobby of writing poems and lyrics to songs myself. I found that doing this gave me a different way to express myself in a healthier way through creating something.

  
3. Work somewhere else: change of scenery is something that has helped me. Whenever I feel I'm in a funk, I just go to a coffee shop the next day to get out of the house



Maybe these don't sound super out there or unique, but the main point here being that you can do whatever works best for YOU. And if you pay attention to what affects you positively, you can get a better sense of what those things are.

35 male from San Jose, Seperated looking to start dating again. Have kids, but not full time. Looking for a normal mature woman for a little physical and emotional connection. Plus if you have kids so you can relate to me. 

I’m educated and work in a field with majority males ( don’t worry, not a tech bro) so I don’t interface women often. I’m 5’8, full head of hair and told that I’m handsome often. I’m weight and height proportional, muscular but not a total gym rat. Don’t have a body type but do require weight and height proportionate, slightly chubby is fine. I am a sucker for super pretty faces. Any height is fine including taller.

I’m a nerdy gear head that loves machines as well as food and coffee. I’m a man’s man but very emotionally intelligent. I also love to be in the kitchen, whether it’s cooking or baking. Also coffee, I love coffee and matcha. 


Hoping to take it slow and swap pics, and if there’s a connection, meet for coffee. 

Let me know more about you!

1juiyin,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1juiyin/review_princess_grand_jamaica/,Review: Princess Grand Jamaica,"This is a new resort (opened Nov 2024) so thought I’d add my experience. I went with my husband and small child first week of April 2025.

Overall from the perspective of a toddler parent that wanted a warm week in a beautiful setting with small children amenities and no cooking or cleaning it hit the mark. Biggest downside for me is the distance from the airport- one hour ride in a private transfer on a Sunday. With a small kid not ideal. I would give this resort a solid 8/10. Which I think is the best we can expect with our budget, post COVID inflation and weak Canadian dollar :)

If you’re a big beach person or a foodie this is not the place for you. If you’re expecting perfection this is not the place for you- my humble opinion is if you want true 5 star luxury,   you need to go non AI. Without a child I would spend my travel dollars differently and would get better value going non AI, but with a child this AI resort hit everything we needed. 

Arrival: we purchased Club mobay through sunwing and it was completely worth it to have help as soon as we stepped off the plane, especially arriving late after flight delays. 

Check in: upon arrival we indicated we wanted to upgrade to platinum club and went to that area to check in. First impression- beautiful place with lots of staff. The modern decor is a departure from the colonial look of many resorts. The platinum club rep listened to my room preferences and found us the perfect room. It took about an hour to get checked in. The area had a playroom for kids which was great. 

Room: beautiful- building 6 overlooking the ocean. The room had no deficiencies. Air conditioning was ok, not super cold but a good temp and no issues with humidity or moldy smells. Lots of storage. Lovely towels and bedding. We had absolutely no issues with our room or with housekeeping.

Grounds: Art Deco style building , gorgeous bay. The building is new however you will notice some maintenance issues here and there, for example the faucets in many of the common bathrooms are loose. Personally this didn’t bother me and the overall impression was still wow gorgeous place. The beach is beautiful to look at, however it’s not great.. the sand is a bit like kitty litter, and when you step in the water your feet really sink in (like a muddy lake bottom). That said there were people swimming in the ocean everyday, and I loved hanging out there for the beautiful view. Also totally sufficient sand for a toddler to dig and play. Another plus for young kids is the beach is smaller and no vendors- as a parent this makes it easier to keep track of your kids and relax. The resort isn’t at capacity so it was wonderful to have so much seating available around the beach and the pools. I also loved how close the beach was to the main pool, so I could see the ocean while playing in the pools. 

Food: I’m not sure how to review food, my expectations are always very low for AI given the scale they need to produce. I would say the food was ok to good. The jerk chicken at the food truck was super tasty, and my husband and I had surprisingly good room service burgers and steak. The platinum buffet was a buffet.. breakfast was better than dinner. We didn’t eat at the non platinum buffet so can’t comment. Coffees and mimosas in the morning were A+. The coffee shop had excellent coffee as well, the ice cream was ok, and pastries ok. Since the resort isn’t at capacity, the a la carte restaurants are fairly easy to get into. For me, Mexican was #1, then Jamaican and then Fusion. Honestly though my main goal with AI food is not to get sick. A big bonus of Jamaica is having safe drinking water. that was awesome with a small kid who doesn’t understand needing to brush teeth with bottled water, no ingesting shower water etc. 

Kids club/amenities: We don’t do drop off with a small child but parents can go into the kids club and use it as a play area. It was super nice and new with a full program of activities. Not busy when we went. We mostly used the platinum club playroom which was perfect for a toddler and no issues bringing adult beverages in :) it’s glassed in so you can hang outside with a drink and still keep an eye on your child. the kid’s water park also was awesome although my kid was fine splashing around in the shallow pool on the quieter side. I loved that the main pool wasn’t very deep, it makes handling small kids so much easier. 

Staff: I found all the staff super kind, I loved how they interacted with our son. There is certainly an expectation of tipping, which I have no issue with, these folks work hard and deserve it.

Quibbles: There is a gaming lounge and a sports bar that is 13 plus only, I personally think at a family resort all amenities outside of kids and teens club should be open to all. Especially since there’s an adult only side right next door! For the platinum upgrade, personally it was worth for us with a young child - we enjoyed getting a nicer quieter room with a tub, and having a special playroom and restaurant, however the butler service I found questionable value. They were very nice and did a few things for us (reserve cabanas, restaurant reservations) but for the cost of tipping them not worth it.

Long story short- we had a great time as toddler parents and would return for the platinum club. ",1,1744132544.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

1juiuuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1juiuuo/where_did_whoooo_goooo_topgun/,Where did whoooo goooo? #topgun,"While out on a date with my SB we were discussing getting rinsed and she was floored that women have the balls to walk out with PPM without giving up the sugar. She said it was funny how they think about making a quick quarter instead of a slow dollar.

Early on in sugaring before I really absorbed this sub had a great M&G, gave her a gift of a few $$$ at coffee, scheduled the 1st date right after. Text all week, lots of pics and suggestiveness. Dinner and then back to the hotel. I always get a suite for the first date to just have somewhere to hang out that isn't the bed. PPM is always by the door. She opens the champagne and starts pouring glasses for us. I go into the bathroom feeling pretty good with how things are going. Come out, then confused Travolta.

My previous SGF told me a story where the guy had her get a room and he would pay her back along with the PPM. They have the date, then horizontal mambo at the hotel. She goes to the bathroom, comes out and he's gone along with all of her clothes. She ended up calling a girlfriend to bring her something and said never again. No PPM and out a few hundred for the room.

SB, SD - What are your best / worst rinser & pump and dump stories?

My boyfriend and I are moving into this room (in an nyc apartment with people we already know), and I am trying to figure out if we have enough space for at least a full size bed AND a living/working space, since we are sharing the main apartment's living space with another couple. I also don't know where to put the bed. (2br 1bath).

He needs desk space (desk, chair), I need lounge space (small sofa?, coffee table?), and we both ideally would have some sort of separation between working/sleeping spaces. I was also thinking that we could combine our desk/lounge space if we need to.

Symptoms and test results added","Hi docs, I'm really struggling with a bunch of issues that make it hard for me to survive my daily life. I've visited 20+ doctors in last year and hasn't helped yet.

About me:
27 M from India. I'm 5'7"" and 72 kg(160 lbs) and have mostly been around that weight range) 

Currently on travoprost, brimodrine and timolol for glaucoma and pantoprazole for gerd.

Physical issues:

- Weakness, I've always been weaker than everyone else, and it's getting worse. Walking with 5+ kgs is difficult, and even though I try to exercise when my body allows me to, I never get stronger and only get weaker. 30-35 kg is my high effort upper limit, and I can't lift over 50kg.
- chronic pain since I remember
- extremely stiff joints
- fatigue, extremely low energy since I can remember
- tiredness and low stamina, easy to exhaust since I remember 
- have had kidney stones
- have had appendicitis surgery 4 years ago
- gastritis since 2 years (confirmed via endoscopy, wasn't repeated)
- acidity/gerd since 3-4 years
- glaucoma since I was 15
- shitty vision (operated in one eye when I was 14)
- Inability to recover (a cold takes more than a month) since 3-4 years 
- inability to heal (an ankle sprain hasn't healed in 4 years, any low-moderate intensity exercise takes me out for several days, a cramp took half a year with physiotherapy)
- hearing struggle (since 3-4 years), although that may be related to mental
- difficulty sleeping, easy to wake up even when sleep deprived. Facing since forever but it's getting worse rapidly.
- Low libido, at least since last 4-5 years it's been very low and in last year or so nearly nonexistent.
- male pattern baldness, I'm not sure if it's a symptom.
- I always feel like I have a stuffed nose and throat.

Mental: 

- social anxiety since 4-5 years
- inability to properly communicate. Idk how to put it but I really struggle to explain myself or to think of what to say or type. Trying to self diagnose led me to a bunch of autism tests online, all of which I aced by a big margin.
- overthinking, ever since I remember.
- brain fog and confusion. Since many many years.
- stress and anxiety have been a big challenge in the last 4-5 years.
- Difficulty in focusing, since more than 5 years. It feels it's getting worse rapidly.

I may have missed some things but tried my best to add all. 

Other details:
- I'm 5'7"" and 72 kg (about 160 lb) BMI being 25, which has always been around 23-26. I have a big belly compared to rest of my body.
- I don't drink, smoke, stay away from soft drinks and am very limited in processed food intake and fried food. Even tea and coffee are rare for me.
- As doctors have prescribed a lot of multivitamins I'm now in normal vitamin levels.

Tests: (regularly testing since 6 years after i started earning)


- My CBC has almost always been normal, although haemoglobin seems to be decreasing slowly. Current level is 14, and current platelet count is slightly below normal at 133.
- ESR and CRP are both slightly elevated (and has always been the case). Current ESR is 11 mmol/h and CRP is 4.50 mg/L.
- Testosterone total is 239. First time tested. FSH, LH and prolactin are normal. 
- hba1c is 5.7 and has always been 5.5 or 5.6.
- Calcium is 9.9 in normal range, B12 at 272 (used to be 230 ish but improved with supplements), vitamin D is 35 (I've mostly been deficit but had a lot of 60k iu supplement) and iron at 67 mcg/dl
- My kidney profile is right in the normal range except uric acid at 9. It has always been over 8.5
- Thyroid profile is normal, 
- liver profile has been mostly normal but currently my sgot and sgpt are slightly elevated(42 and 66). They were borderline high 4 months ago so have gotten worse
- My triglyceride levels are high (397) and HDL is low (36) while LDL is around 97. Historically, my HDL has always been around 33-38 range, while LDL used to be higher and triglycerides were slightly lower.

But it sounded very upbeat, kind of having a primal scream type of soul/funkiness, backup vocals that kept singing ""aaaaaaaaaa-aaall night!"" (NOT like the Lionel Richie song) and a lead singer that sounded quite a bit like Anthony Keidis (I don't think it was him though) singing something like ""at the all American"". It had trumpets or brass in the back, like rock with big soul or funk influence in it. It lasted about maybe 5 minutes, I was trying multiple times with Shazam. It was probably relatively commercial as it was playing at a Black Sheep Coffee. It's been driving me crazy and I am struggling to get back to work with it playing in my head even as I type this.

1juiqtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HerpesQuestions/comments/1juiqtz/tips_for_new_people/,Tips for new people,"Ive had hsv2 for a little over a year now and this page helped me alot so i just wanted to share what i have learned. Don’t expect perfect grammar lol I’m just going to write freely. 

Little about me i am a female and im genZ .

TIPS: 
 1. It is totally okay to be upset about finding out i feel like that is normal but it is also not the end of your life . I do think you should cry and get it all out. Make sure you go to therapy if you need extra help with coping .

2. You can still have a life  . Get to know your self start new hobbies . Hang with friends and family. Travel the world . Start a business,  further your education if you want to . Life doesn’t go on pause just because you have hsv you have so much more life to live .

3. I feel like this goes without saying. Only tell people you reallllly trust . I personally only told my closest family members and a partner i was with when i found out . They all were very supportive and i had them to talk to and rant about stuff . I also talked to my therapist about it as well . 

4. I have dating advice but i haven’t had to tell anyone new. I have hung out with people but it didn’t get to that point . My advice is to really get to know that person see if you feel like they are mature enough to handle that information. Also make sure you are ready emotionally to possibly be rejected. Also don’t  lower your standards for dating just because you have hsv. Stand by the things you value in a person . I personally would tell them in person when it comes to disclosure just because of screenshots . Lol no one deserves to be exposed we are not criminals .

5.Supplements!!! The first 10 months i didnt take antivirals it was a personal choice also i wasnt sleeping with anyone . 
Heres what i take : vitamin E , b12, zinc , black seed oil, l-lysine, vitamin C , monolaurin . 
If your are a woman take a womens probiotic to prevent bv & yeast infections i feel like your more likely to get those things when you have hsv from my experience. 
Right now i do take antivirals just for my partner even though we haven’t done anything yet . 
You should also use the soap femiclear it works for calming things down . 
DRINK LOTS OF WATER YOU SHOULD BE DOING THAT ANYWAYS.

6 find out your triggers. I feel like this takes a while cause your getting to know your body. I feel like for me its mainly stress. Alcohol hasn’t nt been an issue and i drink pretty heavily ngl . Also coffee hasn’t nt been issue for me either .

Thats all for now because i feel like that was alot . Just so you know you are still the same great person  you were before the virus . Use protection if you’re active (unless that person says its okay not too) and always disclose ❤️

Seeing how online dating has become very fussy and fickle I’d become overtly cautious with dating app matches. I never want to say the wrong thing, like walking on eggshells cuz you don’t want to “scare them away”.

Recently I got a match(F) on Tinder, and we quickly got to chatting about our love for coffee, our different preferences in drink orders and favorite coffee shops. I made an on the spot decision to cut through the uncertainty and just be straight up and ask them out on a coffee date.

“Hey, I noticed you’ve yet to ask for my phone number, how else are we going to plan our coffee date? I know a good place, we can set it up while we chat and get to know each other”

Normally I would never ask someone out the same day we matched, but I figured that if I really liked someone’s vibe I couldn’t keep putting myself off and not being straight up when I’m interested. I’ve worked very hard to become a better, healthier and more confident person for my own sake and I wished to show that off.

They never reached out, I don’t feel bummed out about it.

1juilms,https://www.wsj.com/opinion/luigi-mangione-deserves-no-devotion-assassin-killer-murderer-healthcare-ceo-b36139e3,"Luigi Mangione Deserves No Devotion - Whoever is keeping the sub's list, please add ""Demented Fans"" to it.","From the WSJ

Luigi Mangione is a saint, according to his fans: “Saint Luigi, Patron Saint of Healthcare Access for All” their posts read. The 26-year-old accused killer is depicted online with a green mantle, a red Sacred Heart, a gold halo and his hand raised in benediction.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Mr. Mangione’s “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination” of UnitedHealthcare executive Brian Thompson in New York in December—even as a supporter writes, “I hope Luigi doesn’t have to die for us to receive free healthcare like Jesus had to die for us to receive forgiveness.”

You can buy devotional candles bearing Mr. Mangione’s image and a “Prayer of Saint Luigi” on the back. A Saint Luigi “Sherpa Fleece Blanket” for $69.99. A coffee mug for $12. A necklace for $45. A “Patron Saint of Capitalism’s Victims” T-shirt or a “Luigi Mangione Our Patriot Saint Of Healthcare” T-shirt, both for $22.99. St. Luigi Christmas ornaments for $16.99.

An account on GiveSendGo, a Christian crowd-funding site, has raised more than $836,000 for Mr. Mangione’s legal defense. A donor there writes, “I cried on my knees to God as a mother to keep you safe and mentally calm.” Another describes Mr. Mangione as “a father to millions.” The website offers three options to help Mr. Mangione: give, share, pray.

Street art depicting the supposed religious hero has spread, with “God Bless Luigi Mangione” stickers appearing on ATMs. A digital mobile billboard in New York depicts him as a saint, with the image projected on a lower Manhattan building. Murals have sprung up in London and Seattle. Stickers depicting Mr. Mangione as a Christ figure can be found in cities from Paris to West Dundee, Ill. In San Francisco, they show him holding a modified Bible.

Mr. Mangione’s family is Catholic. His grandmother, Mary Mangione, helped Loyola University Maryland in Baltimore acquire an expensive Bible and was memorialized by the school in 2023 as a woman who believed “passionately in the value of Catholic Jesuit education.” His family has contributed millions of dollars to Catholic organizations.

It’s hard to know what Mr. Mangione thinks of his new fans and their iconography. In an old post on X.com, he recommended users look at an article lamenting that “Christianity’s decline has unleashed terrible new gods.” The elevation to sainthood of an accused assassin seems a clear example of how terrible those new gods are.

Mr. Mangione’s fans—the ones wearing the T-shirts and buying pious Luigi keychains—will only get louder, proclaiming him a martyr. More than 40% of Americans age 18-29 think the shooting of the healthcare CEO was acceptable or somewhat acceptable, according to a Dec. 17 Emerson poll. The sanctimonious fervor won’t stop anytime soon.

It’s blasphemy, of course, the idea of saints as glorified killers. And probably few proclaiming his sanctity are actually religious. What all this kitsch shows is an unserious nation that wants a folk hero. Mr. Mangione shouldn’t be it.

1juijs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMAU/comments/1juijs0/tmau1_low_choline_shouldnt_be_possible_to_smell/,"TMAU1 - low choline, shouldn't be possible to smell like fish, but smell like something else?","Hey all. Long post, sorry in advance.

I have TMAU1, been confirmed many times for me with verbal comments. I can smell myself when it reaches a certain thresh-hold, or after an obvious verbal comment I can make myself find it after a few days. I don't pay attention to gestures.

Was told once by a friend that it ""comes and goes"". This past summer was really bad. At the time I was eating a lot of sliced turkey, like 1/2 lb per day, also drinking some coffee. I went to a big social event 100+ people and about 5 people said it was really bad. I could smell it too like once per hour.

Since then I have switched to mainly a vegetarian diet, with only egg white protein as my main protein source. I also monitor everything in chronometer and have a very simple diet due to calorie reasons. Seems to have helped alot, I mean its not really possible to smell like fish (?) if I am so low choline. By theory then. Brutalar always says this anyway LOL.

\- don't smoke, don't drink, no coffee, heavy cardio every day 40 mins, no meat except egg whites, large salad every day. Daily: riboflavin, chlorophyllin, aspirin, berberine (but had to cut back on it).

However, I also started taking an ADHD stimulant (amphetamine) about 3 months ago. This has definitely given me new odors, but they are normal odors, like after a long day I smell bigtime like dirty socks, probably cause my feet sweat more. Mostly after sitting at a comp for 8 hours.

I will say that when I sit for many hours in my computer chair, it kinda smells like ass and balls a bit at the computer here, but not right after a shower. But thats a close range odor that I can only smell through my thin pajama pants, and less so when I am wearing jeans. Maybe thats after taking a smelly dump.

**So -- back to the point of the post.**

When I go out to do errands or to get massage, I have no issues, but its only the provider I am paying who I am with, and like store helpers. I feel confident there, little to no odor. The only time recently someone said I smelled was when I went to get a skin treatment, but that was end of summer when I was still working my diet.

So yeah mostly confident for short errands. When I go to dinner though, I leave the house feeling positive and hopeful there is no odor as I have done everything I can think of to control it - surely its not possible to smell like fish after such a strict diet. But throughout the evening I'll catch what seems to be glimpses of people talking about me or an odor in my direction. This grows over the evening.

But I just can't be sure about it, they are just out of ear shot or I only hear certain things here and there. Could this just be psychological projection on my part? My observations are: it seems like the people are always in a worse mood than me, kind of feel like they are ""low energy"" or cranky, and I am not - I'm feeling good and heart based and in a great space. **Am I sensing just bad energy and trying to give it a ""story""?** As the evening goes on I start to feel like either the smell has come back ? Maybe I have a bit of ORS from years of social paranoia? Or am I projecting or what.

Here is an example. My dinner mate last night had salmon. When I smelled it I was grateful cause I realized ""great I can smell fish tonight and don't smell that coming from me. So no fish odor from me tonight"". But then I caught a nearby table about 10-12 feet away the guy said something that caught my attention. As they were leaving the lady from that table said ""No she had salmon thats what it was"". So: 1. how could she know who had the salmon from 10 feet away? she didn't come close by, was she listening when we ordered. Why did she say something resembling my inner dialog about the salmon? I was thinking earlier, that basically the only odor I could detect was salmon my dinner mate ate. Later someone else said ""it stinks all in that area over there"". Another party, as they approached our table, one person said ""lets try not to get too close to it"". Or so I thought was said.

Whatever the odor was, it must have been at least 5 feet if those comments were true.

Do maybe I smell like ass too? My poops really really smell lately. What are the odds of two conditions? I think super low.

Is my mind playing tricks on me or what? I'm open to that idea, and that would be great. But as history would show, often I have wanted there to be no odor but then I am brought back to earth that yep its back, when I didn't know. So there is always that possibility.

I went out to the movies with a friend a few weeks back while on my ADHD stimulant med and he said he did not smell anything. I think I can trust him.

1. What is the market like for brokerage in Hawaii?

1 A) Other than Hawaii, are there any other comparable, low key, warm places that might be good smaller markets to check out?

I've been in NYC for many years and I'm just so sick of it. I hate the chaos, being surrounded by obnoxious assholes and crackheads 24/7, it's absolutely fucking exhausting and I do NOT want to start a CRE career that will keep me here forever. I need to get the fuck out. I just don't know where to go.

2. Do any CRE brokerages actually offer private offices for brokers? Every single places I have interviewed at has open floor plan environments, and I dont know what fucking psychopath designed thought that was a good idea to make industry standard, but it's a fucking nightmare. I need PRIVACY to conduct my business, to be able to hear my own thoughts while I speak on the phone and not have to listen to 40+ other people's conversations all day. I mean, it's literally fucking lunacy to expect people to be able to perform in the middle of a goddamn zoo like that. It makes no sense and is incredibly disrespectful and exploitative. Not to mention, I dont want to sit at a desk for 8 hours a day, I can make my calls on the go, in a coffee-shop, from the comfort of my own living room, for example. 

This arbitrary ""must work physically in office"" and ""must work in open floor plan environment"" policy bullshit 99% of brokers I've contacted employ makes me want to vomit in their face. It makes me want to not work in this industry to begin with.

Because you know what made me want to work in this industry to begin with? Freedom. Not having a fucking asshole psychopath boss. Being able to work the way I want to work, work the way that is efficient to ME, not having to put on a fucking performance so some asshole senior broker can ""watch me work"" all day. Fucking nightmare!

Anyway, is this just how this works everywhere? Because if so, I'll start looking for a difference industry to break into, I am so fucking sick and tired of having employers operating like this, and to have such expectations for a commission only role is literally fucking insane. Like, you people can go eat your own shit for how you treat people.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

Considered difficult and one of the remote treks lies the beautiful Barun Valley surrounded by the landscape that often feels unreal to the ones who embarks on this epic trek that takes you deep inside the Eastern side of the Himalayas, where you can view the majestic Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, etc. and be right at the basecamp of the 5th Highest mountain the world Mt. Makalu. Starting your trek from the low subtropical vegetation and reaching the highest elevation 4800 meters, this trek is ideal if you are looking for digital detox, authentic experience and pristine wilderness. Hidden from the eyes of the commercial masses, this is an ideal outdoor adventure for the ones who are looking for a serene escape from the modern comforts and amenities, splurging in the nature, in the middle of nowhere for an experience that is almost incomparable to other trekking experiences in the Himalayas. Lying in the region of Makalu Barun National Park, this trek is rather unheard with very few trekkers less than 1000 visiting the region every year.

**Permits and Entry Requirements**

The permits for Makalu Barun National Park can be purchased at Kathmandu, Nepal Tourism Board office or the National Park Office at Seduwa, which is our trek starting point. In addition to this, there is also a provision of Rural Municipality Permit. However, the last time I was there leading the trek, there were no mentions about this permit fees.

There are no requirements of any other permits and permits are issued to Independent Trekkers contrary to the rule of mandatory Trekking Guide.

**Getting to Makalu  Barun National Park**

The most reasonable option to reach the trail head for this trek would be to get a flight from Kathmandu to Tumlingtar Airport. Upon reaching Tumlingtar Airport, you can get a Private Jeep from the Airport to the place called Seduwa that takes about 6-7 hours. The cost for private jeep hire is about 150 USD and Flight Tickets can be on the range of 125 USD. Buddha Air, a private domestic carrier does one flight every day to the airport and hence, acquiring the tickets are not a problem. You can purchase the flight tickets online from their [website.](https://www.buddhaair.com)

Alternatively, you can also travel to Khandbari on a Shared Jeep, Micorbus or a Bus that takes about 8-10 hours from Kathmandu and should cost about NRs. 2500. The local jeep/microbus departs every morning from Koteshwor and tickets are not available online and hence, your ground contact needs to acquire the tickets beforehand.

Other than that, you can take a shared Autorickshaw to the town of Khandbari and get a shared jeep from Khandbari to Num or Seduwa, where you can begin the trek. It should cost about NRs. 3000 per person for the jeep fare. However, looking at the road conditions and the crowd of the local jeeps, I recommend getting a Private Jeep Transfer.

**Trekking Itinerary and No. of Days**

To complete the trek safely with adequate acclimatisation days, you would **require 16 days** starting from Kathmandu and ending at Kathmandu.

The trek starts from the village of Seduwa where you reach on the Day 1 after the Flight from Kathmandu and 7 hours on the Jeep. On 2nd day, the trail is relatively easy to Tashigaon which takes about 5 hours.

On Day 3, we start a rather steep uphilll hike to Khongma that takes about 6-7 hours, where we can have lunch at Dandakharka. Please bear in mind that the trail to Khongma is entirely uphill once you leave Tashigaon and feels the hardest than any other day of the hike. As you reach Khongma, the breathtaking views of the landscape below along with lively forest trails would definitely keep you longing for more in the coming days.

Day 4 would be your acclimatisation day at Khongma since this is your fist night at 3500 meters. Today, you can take rest and let your body adapt to the altitude, as tomorrow we have to traverse the Shipton La (pass) at 4200 metres to reach Dobate and onto the beautiful Barun Valley.

Day 5, we would trek from Khongma via uphill trail till we traverse the beautiful Shipton La. The views of the breathtaking valleys on both sides of the pass along with glimpses of Makalu range and Kanchenjunga range enroute are the highlights of this day.

Having our lunch at one of the two teashops at the pass, we traverse Shipto La via 2 beautiful natural ponds which has got religious significance for the local people and descend down to Dobate which is the entry point to Barun Valley.

To spare you the details of the itinerary, here is an overview of the trek:  
Day 6 - Dobate to Yangle Kharka  
Day 7 - Hike to Shivdhara and Parvati Caves  
Day 8 - Hike to Langmale Kharka  
Day 9 - Langmale to Makalu Base Camp  
Day 10 - Hike to Makalu View Point  
Day 11 - Makalu Base Camp to Yangle Kharka  
Day 12 - Yangle Kharka to Dobate  
Day 13 - Dobate to Khongma  
Day 14 - Khongma to Tashigaon  
Day 15 - Tashigaon to Seduwa (Hike) and Jeep to Tumlingtar  
Day 16 - Tumlingtar to Kathmandu (Flight)

**Highlights of the trek**

Barun Valley is one of the most pristine destination surrounded by the entirety of Makalu Range. Void of permanent human settlement, this valley is the alpine meadows used by the people of the Makalu region to herd their Yaks, Sheeps and Goats. Surrounded by 100s of waterfalls and the beatuiful Barun river that comes from the glaciers of Makalu range, the true beauty of this valley is showcased in monsoon periods when the wildflowers bloom, the landscape comes alive and the occassional mingle of Shepherds and Yak Herders just add to its experience.

Makalu Base Camp, is one of the destination that grants you with one of the most breathtaking views of Mt. Makalu directly from the basecamp to the summit. A short hike to the Makalu View Point grants you an awe inspiring views of the rarely viewed and photographed, Everest, Lhotse and Nuptse in the distance and a longer hike to the High View Point even grants you the views of the vast Tibetan plateus that lies beyond the Himalayas.

Remoteness of the trek is one of the beautiful aspect of the trek. Without any connection to the outside world, this is a perfect escape for trekkers who is looking for an off the beaten path adventure. The rustic and authentic experience of the trek is comparable only to few other treks in Nepal which I will address periodically in other articles.

**Teahouse and/or Camping and Food**

This trek can be completed without any camping equipment or support. There are basic teahouses (not more than 1 or 2) in all the rest stops and the choices are abundant. You can indulge yourself in the basic and hearty meals with the good choice of traditional local and Nepalese dishes and some choices of Western dishes like Porridge, Pasta, etc.

I would suggest packing a Sleeping Bag, as with the less number of teahouses, there might not be enough blankets and the rooms are not well insulated which means the night time temperatures might dip down and the blankets provided by the teahouse is not enough. Regarding the food, Eggs are your main source of protien along with occassional 'sukuti' if your appetite allows for that which is a smoke and sun dried strips of Yak meat.

Other than this, you should pack plenty of powerbars and snacks as the distance between lunch stops and the teahouses is long and we need refuelling along the way. It is also helpful if you can pack a small cook system such as **Jetboil** so that you can have hot water/tea/coffee as you feel like along the trail.

**Sanitation, Hygiene, Laundry Situation and Drinking Water**

As with most of the remote treks in Nepal, there are no provisions of Hot Showers/Gas Showers once we cross Seduwa. There are provisions of Bucket Showers at every tea house. We managed to avail Bucket Shower at Khongma, Yangle Kharka and Langmale for this 16 days trek.

The toilets are Squat toilets and I would suggest packing Hand Sanitiser and Toilet Paper. You can also purchase Toilet Paper along the way and hence, no need to packk extensive quantity.

The teahouses we stay in prepare and handle the food in a safe manner. I haven't observed dirty sanitation and hygiene issues in any of the teahouses and is sufficienty safe for the trek. However, I would still suggest you to pack some Medicines which we will discuss about it later down the article.

Regarding the Drinking water, there are plentiful supply of running water along the way. However, I strongly recommend using **Water Purification Tablets** or **Filtration system** such as **Lifestraw, Sawyer or Ketadyn.** I recommend using no more than 2 litres Nalgene Bottle or a Hydration Bladder as we can fill up the water in every lunch stops and tea houses.

Lastly, Laundry is not available throughout the trek. I would suggest packing in possibly a Laundry Liquid like Sea to Summit Wilderness Wash or Laundry Wash and handwashing your items as you go. You can also use dedicated Laundry system such as [this](https://thescrubba.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqQOpqu5lHzJJhbNQpetg9ZSItbvfMmRu-1H28dqKPbQfWoNRMg).

**Medication, Emergency Care and Evacuation**

For medication along with the ones prescribed your GP, it is essential to carry atleast the following:

* Cold and Flu Tablets
* Diarrhoea Medications and OTC Antacids and Electrolytes
* Broadspectrum Antibiotics as prescribed by your GP
* Anti Allergy Medications (If Any)
* Paracetamol and Ibuprofen
* Crepe Bandage, Blister Tapes, Band Aids, Medical Tapes and Sterile Dressing pad
* Acetazolamide (Diamox), Dexamethasone

Most of the first aid medications would be carried by your Trek Guide. However, I would suggest getting the Cold & Flu Tablets, Diarrhoea Medications, OTC Antacids and Anti Biotics from back home. Other than that medications like Diamox and Dexamethasone should only be taken after your consultation with GP to know about any medicinal allergy and preliminary physical conditions.

As for the **Emergency Care,** there is small health clinic at Seduwa which we reach on the first day of the trek. There is not a dedicated treatment centre along the hike and we must be very proactive in managing the issues of **Altitude Sickness or any other health issues.**

For **Evacuation,** since the trek is remote having the options of riding a Mule or Horse is difficult to impossible due to the terrain. The only option that we have is to call for **Heli Evac**, and hence having a **high altitude trek insurance** that **covers heli evac** is almost mandatory for this trek.

**Cost and Other Details**

If you are doing the trek independently, you can expect to complete this trek on the range of 1800 USD to 2600 USD that includes:

* Kathmandu to Tumlingtar Two Way Flight
* Private Jeep Transfer from Tumlingtar to Seduwa and Back
* Makalu Barun National Park Permit Fees
* Food and Accommodation during the trek

However, if you are looking to do this trek with a Trek Assist and a Guide, then you can expect the cost to be:

* Guide Fees at 40 USD per day (640 USD)
* Trek Assist at 20 USD per day (280 USD)

I would suggest the ideal value is doing this trek with the **minimum of 2-4 people**. This way, most of the fees including the Private Transports, Guide and Trek Assist fees, etc are divided among the members and thus provides reasonable value for the expenses.

**Packing and Preparation**

For Packing and Preparation, I would suggest suggest trying to Pack lightly with all the essentials. Having to depart on at least 10-12 multi day high altitude treks every year, I understand if some of the items below doesn't conform to your requirements and thus can be adjusted accordingly. From my experience of exclusively leading remote treks such as Kanchenjunga, I pack the following for each of my treks along with the associated brand for each of the clothing

1 Fleece Beanie (IB Merino)  
2 Neck Buff (SPF - BUFF and Mid weight BUFF)  
2 Hiking Full Sleeved Quick Dry Hiking Tshirts (Offbrand)  
1 Merino Half Sleeve Hiking Tshirt (Forclaz)  
1 Ice Breaker 260 GSM Merino Thermal Base Layer  
4 Pair of Merino Wool Hiking Socks and 1 pair of Heavy Alpine Trekking Socks (Rohner)  
4 Pair of Underwear (Offbrand)  
2 Hiking Trouser -(1 RAB Torque Mountain and 1 RAB Torque Winter Pants)  
1 Hiking Shorts  (Forclaz)  
1  Mid Layer Fleece ( RAB Evolute)  
1  Down Jacket (RAB Neutrino Pro)  
1 Goretex Shell Top (OR Foray II)  
1 Goretex Shell Bottom (Marmot Minimalist Rain Trousers)  
1 Fleece Gloves (RAB Power Stretch Pro)  
1 Heavy Gloves (BD Guide Gloves)

1 First Aid Kit with all the aforementioned items  
1 Pair of Knee Compression Sleeves  
Jetboil Minimo and Butane Canister  
Hydralyte Electrolyte Satchets  
1 Victorinox Multi Tool  
1 BD Cosmo Headlamp and spare batteries (AAA Duracell)  
1 ltr Nalgene Bottle  
2 ltr Platypus Hydration Bladder

1 Sleeping Bag (Neutrino Pro Comfort R -4C)  
1 Pair of Trekking Shoes (La Sportiva TX S)  
1 Pair of Flipflops

3-4 Powerbars and some snacks

Toiletry and Personal Hygeine Kit including Sea to Summit Wilderness Wash for Laundry

Packed in 70 ltrs Forclaz  MT100 Easyfit

After all the wearables, the bagpack the weight is around 12-14 kgs or 26-30 lbs. This is the standard weight that I carry as part of the job and thus, can be more lenient or light depending on your needs or preferences.

**Connectivity and Electricity**

The last place to have cellular connectivity would be Tashi Gaon and the last place to have cellular connectivity along with Internet connection would be the first day of your trek at Seduwa. Beyond Tashi Gaon, you have very sparse cell connectivity until Khongma and almost zero connectivity after Khongma especially over Shipton La.

Still, I would suggest getting a **NTC Simcard** after you land in Nepal which has got more remote connectivity than other popular carrier **NCell**.

I suggest you have a Satellite Communicator like InReach Mini to let your loved ones know about your situation. I personally use InReach Explorer for general messaging for remote treks and Thuraya Satellite Phone  exclusively for Emergency Communication.

Like Cellphone connectivity, the last point to have electricity would be Seduwa. Beyond Seduwa, the villages are only **powered by Solar** and hence, I would suggest carrying a Power Bank and a Portable Solar Panel (if required) if you have lots of electronic devices (Camera, GPS, Smarwatch, Cellphone).

**Cash and Currency Exchange**

Since the trek is disconnected from the grid, I would suggest having all the cash in **Nepalese Rupees**. I understand that you might be hiking with big chunk of cash but the trek itself is very safe and you don't need to worry about misdeeds.

I would suggest 60 USD worth of Nepalese rupees per day for your F/A Expenses and about NRs. 20,000 more as an emergency or backup fund. There are no currency exchange facilities once you leave Kathmandu and hence, I would suggest doing it at any of the currency exchange shops at Thamel. There are some ATM at the town of Khandbari but it can be pretty hit or miss with the international cards and hence, suggest you for all the transactions at Kathmandu itself.

**Other FAQs**

**Is hiring a Guide mandatory for doing this trek?**

Contrary to the rules, it hasn't been enforced and you can easily do this trek by yourself. However, since this is a remote trek and if you aren't experienced to multi day high altitude treks, then I would recommend having a trekking guide for this trek who can arrange the logistics of the trek as well as Guide you along the way.

**What is the weight limitation for Trek Assists?**

We don't have mandated weight limitations. However, I would suggest trying to keep the weight under 8 kgs, as the Trek Assists are shared among 2 trekkers. With 16 kgs of luggage and 4-5 kgs of his own bagpack we ensure our Trek Assist is carrying no more than 20-21 kgs or 40 lbs.

Also, if you are hiring a Trek Assis, we should pack the stuff in good bagpacks probably 100 ltr capacity so that the they don't need to use the [head straps](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-nepalese-porters-use-a-head-strap-locally-called-a-namlo-to-support-81980000.html) which might be detrimental to their healthy mainly due to **vertebral compression**. Although the head straps have been used since years ago, we must be the part of positive change to our Trek Assists and help them have a better and safe work environments.

**How do I select the Agency or go forward for this trek?**

For remote treks, I believe there are only handful of Agencies and Trekking Guides who have the experience of organising and leading these kind of treks. Most of the agencies and websites shall feed you the same information just paraphrased along the way. This is one of your indicators that the Agency or the Trekking Guide doesn't know what they are selling to you.

You can ask for recent information regarding the trail such as till last October, the Jeep access was only up to the village of Num and a bit below to the place called Chamlakharka. However, it has been about 3 months that they have completed the bridge and now the jeep access is till Seduwa.

You can ask for pictures of Makalu Base Camp with their clients. Most of the trekking guides have atleast one photo with their clients or the trekking agencies have photo with their banners.

Lastly, ask for referrals from the clients that they have done the exact trek before. At this day and age, I don't trust just the reviews but a real world referral of the trek experience of any previous client who completed this particular trek.

Just last year, an inexperienced trekking guide who was leading a trek in Kanchenjunga region at the time of torrential rainfall failed to get updated with the alternative trail. While I was leading the trek via the alternative trail, we could see a landslide on the old trail that had caused one of his team member (Camp Kitchen Staff) to be buried underneath and passing away just an hour ago. The trek guide was new to the region and had only led the way based in internet accounts and relying on offline apps for navigation. Having the first hand knowledge of the landscape, potential fall areas, alternative trails, etc. are the key to leading a safe trek.

**Conclusion**

Makalu Base Camp trek is one of the most pristine destination hidden away from the commerical masses of the trekkers. Mainly the remoteness of the trek that requires significant time contribution acts as a deterrent to many trekkers. If you are looking for a perfect alternative to Everest Base Camp but still want to see Everest and also Mt. Makalu, then this remote adventure will check all the boxes to be an authentic experience of the Himalayas.

1jui8z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jui8z6/i_dont_love_my_husband_anymore/,I don't love my husband anymore.,"My husband and I have been together for 25 years and I realized yesterday that I truly don't love him anymore.

We've been through a lot together but I've been met with walls and deflection at every avenue. He's a cold and distant person, almost stoic. And I know a lot of it comes from his upbringing and childhood. He's English and working class.

He's become my nursemaid over time. I'm chronically ill and take a small pharmacy's worth of medications everyday just to be remotely functional. He prepares my meds, lunch, coffee and I know this is how he shows he loves me. 

But he's not affectionate or expressive. I have to remind him to kiss me or to hug me. Now I don't really want him to even start because I know that in a month or two months it's just going to stop again. We've always had problems with intimacy - both physical and emotional. And now that I'm mid perimenopause, it's blessedly no longer a problem. I don't want to have sex so I don't have to fight to get someone's interest.

I did want children but the only time I got pregnant, that I knew of, it was ectopic and nearly deadly. I was ready to try again but he resisted and just kind of didn't respond when I asked about it. Now I'm in my 40s, at a point to where it wouldn't be safe, and it's over. 

I confronted him about it a couple years ago and he admitted he'd avoided the conversation because he didn't want to lose me. But he took that choice away. He made the decision by postponing it. He just didn't say anything. He falls back on ""processing things internally,"" which is a phrase our marriage counselor taught him. But really it just gives him an excuse to not say or do anything until he gets the result he wants.

Everything in our lives came to us because I made it happen. His visa to live here at first was me. Our mortgage was because of me. Our car loans and vacations are because of me. Our friend group is because of me. Everything is because of me. 

I encourage him to get hobbies, to do things without me. But I'm all he wants. He's entirely dependent on me for the bigger things in his life and I am tired. 

He's been helping me with my GLP-1 injections. While I'm not afraid of needles, I've been struggling with injecting myself. When I started them, back in December, he gave me 10x the dose I was supposed to have because he wasn't paying attention. I spent 48 hours vomiting until I could get a prescription for zofran. It was an awful month. 

He's finally in therapy. It was a condition after he fucked up the dosage of my GLP-1. He does have ADHD and is likely depressed. He's also on medication for both and I had to push him to get meds. But it's too late. He started therapy because of me but I'm hoping it will make him better to be on his own.

We used to be best friends but now our interests are so different and our values just don't match. (The interests not matching is essentially that I have them and he doesn't.) It's the proverbial square peg round hole. 

I'm not a perfect person but I am constantly working on myself to be a better wife, a better employee, better at my job, improve my health and he is entirely inert. 

He's in the process of getting his citizenship and once that happens, it's over. I don't know what that means as far as the house and everything goes. I work for the government and am attached to the feds in a very roundabout way. If DOGE gets as far as us, it's very likely I will lose my job and struggle to find another one with a flooded market. But we do have emergency savings and I can make it for a least a year. He can always return to England if he wants to. He still has family there, we still have friends. 

Obviously it hasn't been entirely bad over the last 25 years but the bad is overshadowing everything now.

I just want to be done. I want to be broken and I want to heal. I want to look out for myself and my cats and be free to take care of myself and be truly loved.",6,1744130822.0,TrueOffMyChest,9,0.65,False

But……

You gotta take control of your health and your life. Thats why I took one day off yesterday from my typical energy drink consumption and I felt like absolute dog shit. I realized how dependent I had become. Today I’m sticking with Yerba Mate. Yerba mate is a natural drink rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that support overall health and reduce inflammation. It provides a smooth, focused energy boost thanks to its balanced blend of caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline—without the jittery crash of coffee. When consumed in moderation, it can support digestion, mental clarity, and heart health, making it one of the healthier energy drink alternatives.

1jui8ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstagramBro/comments/1jui8ic/how_can_i_design_an_instagram_aesthetic_that/,How can I design an Instagram aesthetic that attracts followers?,"Creating a cohesive and visually appealing Instagram aesthetic is a great way to grab the attention of potential followers and keep your existing ones engaged. Here’s how you can design an aesthetic that stands out and attracts more followers:

# 1. Define Your Brand Style ✨

Your Instagram aesthetic should reflect **who you are** and what you want to communicate with your audience. Start by thinking about your:

* **Niche**: What is your Instagram about? (e.g., travel, fitness, fashion, food)
* **Mood/Emotion**: Do you want your feed to feel relaxed, energetic, luxurious, or minimalistic?
* **Target Audience**: Who are you speaking to? Define the type of person who would resonate with your content.

🔹 **Pro Tip**: Get inspired by other Instagram accounts in your niche, but avoid copying. Your aesthetic should be unique to you!

# 2. Stick to a Consistent Color Palette 🎨

Colors play a huge role in defining your Instagram aesthetic. Choose **2-4 main colors** and use them consistently across your posts. This helps to create a unified look.

* For example, if you're into travel content, you might use warm tones like oranges and yellows, or blues and whites for a fresh, coastal vibe.
* Tools like **Adobe Color** or **Coolors** can help you create a palette that looks balanced and harmonious.

🔹 **Pro Tip**: Use **photo-editing apps** like **Lightroom** or **VSCO** to apply the same color grading to all your photos and videos. This keeps the vibe consistent.

# 3. Create a Cohesive Grid Layout 📅

Your Instagram feed is like a puzzle, and each post is a piece of that puzzle. The way your posts appear together on the grid can either make or break your aesthetic. Try these layout strategies:

* **Alternating Patterns**: Use alternating post styles (e.g., photo, graphic, quote) to create a dynamic but cohesive flow.
* **Row-by-Row**: Create a pattern where each row of three posts is visually linked (e.g., one row with all nature photos, another with close-ups).
* **Color Blocking**: Plan out posts with colors that complement or match one another, creating blocks of color as you scroll down.

🔹 **Pro Tip**: Tools like **Planoly** or **Preview** can help you plan your grid layout ahead of time, so you can see how everything will look together before posting.

# 4. Consistent Editing Style 📸

Your editing style plays a big role in setting the tone of your feed. Decide on a signature editing style and stick to it.

* **Filters**: Choose a filter that matches your vibe (e.g., moody, bright, vintage).
* **Lighting**: Ensure your photos are **well-lit** and have a similar brightness across the feed.
* **Contrast**: Keep the contrast levels consistent—don’t go from super dark and moody photos to very bright and airy ones unless you’re okay with switching up the aesthetic.

🔹 **Pro Tip**: Use **Lightroom presets** for a quick and uniform look on all your photos. You can create your own or buy preset packs online.

# 5. Incorporate Visual Themes or Symbols 🌱

Themes and recurring visual elements can make your feed feel more cohesive. Consider:

* **Natural Elements**: If you’re in the wellness or travel niche, add nature elements (plants, sunsets, beaches) as recurring visuals.
* **Typography**: Choose a couple of fonts that represent your style for consistency in quotes or text-based content.
* **Props**: Incorporate specific props into your photos (e.g., a coffee cup, book, sunglasses) to create continuity.

🔹 **Pro Tip**: Create a **signature symbol**—like a specific angle or item (such as a signature outfit, color, or accessory)—and use it in your posts to make them instantly recognizable.

# 6. Use White Space for Balance ✨

White space (or negative space) is important in design because it helps balance out your feed and allows each post to """"breathe."""" It prevents your posts from feeling cluttered and makes the content more visually appealing.

* Leave some space around your subject in the frame (i.e., don’t always zoom in on your subject).
* Keep backgrounds simple and clean to highlight the main focus of the photo.

🔹 **Pro Tip**: Don’t be afraid of having **plain backgrounds** or **empty space** in your photos. This can give your feed a modern, minimalist feel.

# 7. Mix Up Your Content Types 🌀

To keep things interesting and attract a variety of followers, mix up your content types while staying true to your aesthetic:

* **Carousels**: Share a collection of images or a step-by-step guide.
* **Videos/Reels**: Use Instagram’s video features to engage followers with behind-the-scenes looks, tutorials, or fun challenges.
* **Quotes**: Share motivational or niche-related quotes with visually appealing typography.

🔹 **Pro Tip**: Even if you’re mixing content, make sure the overall feel of the posts remains consistent. For example, your video editing style should match your photo editing.

# 8. Post Regularly, But Not Too Much 🕒

To maintain your aesthetic and keep your followers engaged, it’s important to post consistently. But don’t overwhelm your audience.

* **Quality over quantity**: Focus on posting high-quality content that matches your aesthetic rather than posting multiple times a day just to keep up.
* **Consistency is key**: Post at regular intervals (e.g., 3-4 times a week) to keep your audience engaged without overdoing it.

🔹 **Pro Tip**: Use **Instagram Insights** to determine when your audience is most active, and schedule posts during peak times.

# 9. Be Authentic and True to Yourself 💯

Your Instagram aesthetic should represent **your authentic self**. Don’t just chase trends because everyone else is doing it—find a style that feels right for you.

* **Share your story**: Whether it’s through the captions or the photos themselves, authenticity will attract followers who resonate with you and your journey.
* **Have fun**: Your Instagram should feel like a reflection of you, not just a curated feed. Embrace your personality!

🔹 **Pro Tip**: Engage with your audience by responding to comments, sharing behind-the-scenes content, and showing your true self.

# 10. Keep Evolving 🌱

Your Instagram aesthetic doesn’t have to be fixed forever. Over time, it’s okay to evolve as your style and interests change. Don’t be afraid to refresh your aesthetic if it no longer feels aligned with who you are.

* **Experiment**: Play with new colors, themes, or editing styles, and see what resonates with your audience.
* **Stay open**: Instagram trends change, and it’s important to be adaptable while staying true to your unique vibe.

Designing an Instagram aesthetic that attracts followers is about finding the right balance between **authenticity, consistency**, and **creativity**. By defining your style, sticking to a color palette, and mixing up content, you’ll create an Instagram feed that feels cohesive, professional, and appealing to your audience.

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. 

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. 

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop.

I’m not interested in ever being friends after this. I don’t deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". AITA ?

Also, if he ever comes up to me to try to ""talk"", what should I do/say? Ive completely ceased contact with the entire group.",2,1744130630.0,AITAH,2,0.75,False

## Understanding the Need for Reliable Water Purification

Before we delve into the specifics of the RapidPure water bottle, let's understand why a portable water purifier is so crucial.

**For Outdoor Enthusiasts:** Imagine embarking on a multi-day hiking trip.The allure of pristine streams might be tempting, but appearances can be deceiving. Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and bacteria lurk even in clear-looking water sources. The best water bottle for hiking isn’t necessarily the lightest, but the one that ensures your safety, safeguarding you from debilitating waterborne illnesses that can derail your adventure. Backpacking water filter bottle options are plentiful, but finding one that efficiently purifies is key.**for International Travelers:** Venturing to developing countries opens you up to incredible experiences, but it also exposes you to potential health risks. Tap water in many regions is unsafe to drink, carrying harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites. A water bottle for international travel becomes an indispensable tool for staying healthy and hydrated. The ability to access safe drinking water outdoor can make all the difference.

**For Emergency preparedness/Survivalists:** Natural disasters, power outages, and unexpected emergencies can disrupt access to clean water. having a reliable water purification solution within your survival gear or bug out bag is essential for survival and self-sufficiency. In such situations, an emergency water filter can be a lifesaver.

**For Health-Conscious Individuals:** Even in modern, developed countries, concerns about water quality persist. Municipal water treatment processes don't always remove all contaminants, and some individuals prefer an extra layer of protection.A water filtration system bottle offers peace of mind, ensuring you’re consuming the cleanest water possible.

**For Gift Shoppers:** finding that perfect,practical gift can be tough.Gifting something like a reliable water bottle with viral filter or bacteria filter shows you care about the recipient’s health and well-being,be it for a seasoned adventurer or someone just starting to explore the outdoors.

*   **Filter Lifespan Limitation:** Requires replacement filters after a specific amount of use, adding to the overall cost.
*   **price:** The initial rapidpure water bottle price can be higher than standard water bottles or basic water filters.
*   **Potential for Clogging:** Very silty, muddy water could potentially clog the filter, although this is mitigated by pre-filtering through a cloth if necessary.
*   **Limited Capacity:** The bottle's capacity might not be sufficient for all needs, notably on long hikes or in hot climates when more water is needed.

The value of the adventure Medical Kits RapidPure Purifier Water Bottle hinges on your specific needs and circumstances.

**for the Avid Hiker/Backpacker:** If you frequently trek through remote areas where water sources are questionable,the RapidPure offers a meaningful advantage over basic water filters. The ability to eliminate viruses is a crucial benefit, especially in regions with a higher risk of viral contamination. the convenience of purifying water as you drink is also a plus, saving time and effort on the trail. For those prioritizing the best water bottle for backpacking, this could be a strong contender.

**For the International Traveler:** traveling to countries with unreliable water infrastructure makes the RapidPure an invaluable asset. It provides peace of mind knowing you can access safe drinking water, reducing the risk of traveler's diarrhea and other waterborne illnesses. The water bottle for international travel alleviates the need to constantly buy bottled water and is a more sustainable option.

## Alternatives to the RapidPure Purifier Water Bottle

While the RapidPure Purifier Water Bottle offers a compelling solution, several alternatives exist, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

*   **Lifestraw Peak Series:** The LifeStraw is a well-known brand offering a range of water filters and purifiers. Their Peak Series includes bottles that filter out bacteria and parasites, but some models do not filter viruses.
*   **Sawyer Products Squeeze Water Filter:** Sawyer offers a lightweight and versatile water filter that can be used in various ways,including attaching it to a standard water bottle,using it as an in-line filter with a hydration pack,or drinking directly from the source. While excellent at eliminating bacteria and protozoa, it doesn't eliminate viruses.
*   **GRAYL Geopress Water Purifier:** The GRAYL Geopress is a purifier bottle that uses a pressing mechanism to force water through a filter, removing viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. It's a robust and reliable option but requires more effort than the RapidPure's squeeze-free design.
*   **Steripen Ultra:** The Steripen uses ultraviolet (UV) light to kill bacteria, viruses, and protozoa in water. It's a lightweight and effective option but requires batteries or charging and may not work as well in cloudy or turbid water.*   **Traditional Water Purification Tablets:** Iodine or chlorine dioxide tablets are a cost-effective way to purify water, but they can leave an unpleasant taste and require a waiting period before the water is safe to drink.

When choosing an alternative, consider the level of purification required, ease of use, portability, cost, and lifespan.

*   **Pre-Filtering Turbid Water:** If the water source is particularly silty or muddy, pre-filter the water through a cloth or coffee filter to prevent clogging.
*   **Proper Storage:** When not in use, store the bottle in a cool, dry place.*   **Filter Replacement:** Replace the filter according to the manufacturer's recommendations (usually after purifying a certain amount of water or after a specific period of time) to maintain optimal performance.

Not to add that I had a fight with my mom and sister. I felt alone, useless, and unsure. I fell for a guy who made me realize I wasn't straight but at the same time he couldn't go through it because his family would never accept him, so he left. 

I was having an identity crisis, was heartbroken, had failing grades, and a dysfunctional family. The only way out was to have a meet and greet with G, i guess. So I did, I overdosed myself with medicine I had to buy somewhere shady. In January 2016 I did the deed but was found and was rushed to the hospital.

Its been years but I do hope the other one got out and is now living a life they full of happiness. After that year. I planned to move out of Baguio the only place I knew.

We meet, we grab a coffee.

You talk… about yourself

About your dreams and hopes.

We walk, I start to uncover you.

I shrug, I don’t see the charm.

I reluctantly keep you.


We continue…

You being you, me being me.

We proudly keep existing,

One mission is what we have:

You aiming to change me,

Me trying to reshape you.


Time goes by,

Still not falling for you,

Or so I pretend.

I don’t even want you;

I only like talking to you 24/7,

Crave seeing your face,

Cherish being near you,

Find you haunting my thoughts,

Dream of one day kissing you.

It doesn’t mean I want you,


Time flies…

You change…

My charm fades from your eyes.

You move on,

Leaving me behind.

It’s not like I care,

Or so I tell myself.


One day I wake up,

Realizing you’re gone,

A void in my world.

In my quiet moments,

I linger in the past,

I reach for memories,

Fragments of what could have been,

But never was.


I die, knowing you won’t be around.

So many words unspoken,

Crushing my silent heart.

I miss you,

In ways words fail to capture.

gone in the void of my own making,

Forever longing,

Forever lost.

# Bose QuietComfort Ultra vs AirPods Max (2025): Which Noise Cancelling King Reigns Supreme?

The battle for noise-cancelling supremacy is a perennial contest, and 2025 sees two titans clash once again: the Bose QuietComfort Ultra and the Apple AirPods Max. Both represent the pinnacle of over-ear headphone technology, promising immersive sound, extraordinary noise cancellation, and a premium listening experience. But which one truly reigns supreme? This in-depth comparison dives deep into the features, performance, and value of each, helping you decide whether the Bose QuietComfort Ultra is worth it over AirPods Max, or if Apple's offering remains the king of the hill.

[[Explore Top Rated bose quietcomfort ultra vs airpods max on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=bose quietcomfort ultra vs airpods max)
## Design and Build Quality: A Clash of Aesthetics and Materials

the AirPods Max boast a striking and instantly recognizable design, featuring a stainless-steel headband and breathable knit mesh canopy. This combination creates a premium feel and distributes weight effectively. The earcups, crafted from anodized aluminum, exude quality. However, some users find the headband mesh susceptible to collecting dust and debris. The industrial design certainly screams ""apple,"" and some appreciate the minimalist aesthetic.

In contrast, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra adopts a more traditional, understated design. Predominantly constructed from premium plastics and plush leatherette, they prioritize comfort and lightweight feel. While some may find the design less visually striking than the AirPods Max, Bose places a strong emphasis on durability and long-term wearability. The build quality feels robust, built for everyday use, and the QC Ultra often surpasses the AirPods Max in portability due to its more compact folding design.

When it comes to aesthetics, the choice is subjective. But in terms of durability and practicality, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra holds a slight edge, especially if portability is a key concern.Consider whether you prioritize sleek industrial design or a more understated, agreeable, and travel-friendly option.

## Comfort: Marathon Listening Sessions Demanding Supreme Comfort

comfort is paramount for over-ear headphones, especially during extended listening sessions. The AirPods Max, despite their heavier weight, manage to distribute pressure relatively well thanks to the mesh canopy.Though, some users with larger heads may experience discomfort after prolonged use due to clamping force. The earcups are spacious, but the aluminum construction can feel cool or even slightly cold against the skin.

The Bose QuietComfort Ultra consistently excels in comfort. The plush earcups and lightweight design make them incredibly comfortable for hours on end. The clamping force is gentler than the AirPods Max, resulting in a less fatiguing listening experience.User feedback often highlights the superior comfort of the Bose QC Ultra, making it a top choice for travel, commute, or work-from-home scenarios. ultimately, for those prioritizing all-day wearability, the Bose QC Ultra comes to the front as more comfortable.

## Noise Cancellation: Blocking Out the World

Noise cancellation is were both headphones truly shine, representing the cutting edge of technology. The AirPods Max utilize a sophisticated active noise cancellation (ANC) system, effectively silencing a wide range of ambient sounds. They excel at blocking out consistent noises like engine hum or office chatter.Openness mode allows you to hear your surroundings clearly without removing the headphones.

the Bose QuietComfort Ultra takes noise cancellation to another level.Bose has a long-standing reputation for industry-leading noise cancellation, and the Ultra doesn't disappoint. Their advanced noise cancellation algorithms are notably effective at eliminating unpredictable noises, such as conversations or sudden bursts of sound. While the AirPods Max are excellent, the Bose QC Ultra delivers a noticeably quieter and more immersive listening experience, making it ideal for noisy commutes, bustling coffee shops, or airplane travel. The race between AirPods Max and Bose quietcomfort Ultra over the best noise cancelling truly comes down to the specific technology you prefer.[[Explore Top Rated bose quietcomfort ultra vs airpods max on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=bose quietcomfort ultra vs airpods max)
## Sound Quality: A Symphony of Detail and Immersion

Sound quality is another crucial factor for audiophiles and casual listeners alike. The AirPods Max delivers a balanced and detailed sound signature with a slight emphasis on clarity. they offer crisp highs, clear mids, and a punchy bass response. The spatial audio feature creates an immersive soundstage, placing sounds in a three-dimensional space around the listener. Adaptive EQ tailors the sound to the individual's ear shape, further enhancing the listening experience.

The Bose QuietComfort Ultra offers a slightly warmer and more balanced sound signature. The bass is present and impactful without being overwhelming, and the mids and highs are clear and well-defined. Bose's immersive audio technology creates a similar spatial audio effect, enhancing the sense of depth and realism. Expert opinions often lean slightly towards the Bose for a more natural and balanced soundstage, especially for those who appreciate a warmer tone.

Ultimately,sound preference is subjective. The AirPods Max offer a slightly more analytical and detailed sound, while the Bose QC Ultra provides a warmer and more balanced listening experience. It's advisable to try both if possible to determine which signature best suits your preferences. Many consider the Bose Ultra vs AirPods Max sound quality to be a matter of taste and musical genre.[[Explore Top Rated bose quietcomfort ultra vs airpods max on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=bose quietcomfort ultra vs airpods max)
## Features and Connectivity: Ease of Use and Ecosystem Integration

Apple's ecosystem integration is a important advantage for AirPods Max users. Seamless pairing with Apple devices, automatic switching between devices, and Siri voice control provide a smooth and intuitive user experience. However, the AirPods Max are less versatile with non-Apple devices.

The bose QuietComfort Ultra offers broader compatibility, working seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices. Bluetooth 5.3 ensures a stable and reliable connection. The Bose Music app allows for customization of EQ settings and noise cancellation levels. while the integration isn't as seamless as with Apple's ecosystem, the QC Ultra provides greater versatility for users with mixed device environments. Bose QuietComfort Ultra features are thus accessible to a broader range of users.

## Battery Life: Powering Your Day

battery life is a practical consideration for everyday use. The AirPods Max offer up to 20 hours of listening time with noise cancellation enabled. However, the battery can drain quickly if left in the smart case, which doesn't fully power down the headphones.

The Bose QuietComfort Ultra boasts a slightly longer battery life, offering up to 24 hours of listening time with noise cancellation.The included hard case fully powers down the headphones when stored,preventing needless battery drain. Airpods Max vs Bose QC Ultra battery life is a factor to consider, especially for frequent travelers.

[[Explore Top Rated bose quietcomfort ultra vs airpods max on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=bose quietcomfort ultra vs airpods max)
## Price and Value: Investing in audio Excellence

The AirPods Max are positioned at the higher end of the headphone market, reflecting their premium design, advanced features, and Apple ecosystem integration. It is expensive and some people might be looking for Airpods Max cheaper alternatives.

The Bose QuietComfort Ultra comes in at a competitive price point, typically slightly less expensive than the airpods Max. While still a premium product, the QC Ultra offers excellent value for money, considering its exceptional noise cancellation, comfortable design, and balanced sound quality. If you're considering the value proposition and looking for deals on AirPods Max and Bose QC Ultra, be sure to compare prices from various retailers.

My ex and I were high school sweethearts, but our relationship was on-and-off—mostly because of me. We started dating in 10th grade, but after just over two months, I got the ""ick"" and ended things. The same pattern repeated in 11th and 12th grade. He was smart, sensitive, and someone I truly cared for, but our connection lacked depth. We rarely talked about meaningful things, never made exciting plans, and often just sat in silence during recess (which, looking back, is kind of funny).  

I used to believe in waiting until marriage for physical intimacy, and while we had chemistry, nothing really happened between us. He seemed fine with that, but I always wanted more: more connection, more fun. And fun was (and still is) a crucial part of any relationship for me.  

Some Background on Him:  
At 15, he told everyone his mother had died — only for her to ""resurrect"" when we were 18. I think it was his way of coping with his parents’ separation. He also once admitted he’d had a crush on me before we got together, but when I brought it up again in 12th grade, he denied it. I didn’t push it.  

After high school, we went our separate ways but eventually reconnected and stayed together for over a year. During that time, I took a gap year, started working, and spent most of my earnings on the relationship—driving him around, taking him out, buying him gifts (a watch, clothes, perfume, you name it). I had a hard time letting anyone, especially a guy, spend money on me because I didn’t want to feel indebted.  

Later, he started tutoring part-time and bought me jewelry — a silver bracelet and a gold ring. They weren’t my style, but I wore them anyway cuz they were a gift from Him. His social awkwardness never changed, and I often felt like it reflected poorly on me. I even picked up smoking because he did.  

The Red Flags:  
He used to talk about a girl who (to put it bluntly) ""belonged to the streets."" She’d stop in the middle of the road to say hi to him, yell, dressed provocatively, and according to him, she’d take him to her rooftop and try to get physical. I never pressed for details because it made me uncomfortable, but now I realize he was probably lying.  

Eventually, I gave in to physical intimacy with him—something I later regretted because he’d been begging for it. He also never encouraged my ambitions. When I mentioned becoming an English teacher, he seemed fine with it, but when I decided to pursue healthcare instead, he was indifferent.  

The Breakup:  
I ended things abruptly in a coffee shop with an angry letter (I was 18 or 19). I even drove him home afterward, and when Rihanna’s “What’s My Name?"" came on, he started singing along which gave me the worst ick (though I get now that he was just trying to cope). Afterward, he lied about clubbing to make it seem like he was fine without me.  

My family was better off financially, and he once made a weird comment about me taking public transport instead of my car to see him. Post-breakup, he refused to speak to me but still frequented the coffee shops I’d introduced him to even though they were far from where he lived or studied.  

Meeting My Now-Husband:  
Two months before the breakup, I met my future husband. I’d already been planning to leave my ex, so it wasn’t about cheating. Five months after the breakup, my now-husband and I got together, and I felt an immediate sense of happiness and maturity with him.  

One evening, while we were holding hands at my usual coffee shop, my husband’s expression changed. I turned and saw my ex glaring at me as if he’d ""caught"" me cheating. He later accused me of lying.  

My best friend at the time ghosted me (though she recently apologized after 15+ years). She and my ex then dumped all the gifts I’d ever given them at my doorstep during a downpour, ruining everything. I donated the damaged items, but it was a brutal way to drive home that I meant nothing to them.  

For a long time, I felt numb. He kept showing up at those coffee shops, even bringing his new girlfriend, but we never spoke except once when I approached him. I told him I was still the same person, and his only response was to ask if I’d gained weight (laughable, considering I used to turn heads).  

Moving On:  
Now, I’m happily married to my best friend someone I laugh with, share everything with, and who helped me grow. Early on, I opened up to him about my ex, and he reassured me that his dislike for the guy wasn’t just because he was my ex, but because of his behavior.  

For a while, my ex haunted my thoughts, and I wondered if I’d wronged him. But I hadn’t thought about him in years until recently when I stumbled upon old school memories and felt a pang of guilt.  ",1,1744129986.0,AskMenAdvice,1,1.0,False

So I was at a sporting event last year and during the game while I was walking back to my seat i slipped on a step and broke my leg at the venue. Paramedics on site helped me to the back room where they took vitals and other information and then I got sent to the ER by ambulance which was about a block or two away from the venue. A few days later I look up injury law firms, I literally only did a couple Google searches and less than 10 calls since I've never been in this type of situation. Most law firms had the same kind of contracts. I went with the people I chose because they were the only ones with more than 10 years experience (40). But the contract basically states IF they come to a settlement they would take 30% while I pay nothing. Like I said most places I called had something similar and others wouldn't take me unless I paid. I'm only coming here to see if this truly is something normal and also it has been over a year and a half and I just saw someone get paid 50 mil off a spilled Starbucks coffee. My situation seems more severe and I don't think I'm anywhere in that range any time I try and get information from my people. Anyone have similar cases? Do I just let it play out? Is there a situation where I do pay and they actually work the case harder where the payout is larger?

I have been roasting for our household for a few years, started with a stock SR800 and now I have the latest Razzo chamber so I can roast 300g batches, which works fairly well, though I do have to rotate the chamber a few times a minute during roasts to keep them even. I roast about 7-8 lb of green beans per month.

I am at the point when I want to roast larger batches now, so I have been looking around and it seems like Kaleido might be a good fit, but I have a few questions that I am hoping y'all can help with...

* I currently roast under the kitchen exhaust fan and that works great. I have no problem with the smell of roasted coffee in the house (I love it!) and I never roast past second crack, so smoke is pretty minimal. Would I be able to sit the M6 on the stovetop under the exhaust fan the same way?
* The M6 specs say a 20A 120V breaker is required - has anyone successfully used on a 15A circuit? Getting the outlets rewired for 20A would add a bit to the price. I assume it is not running at full power all the time?
* I assume moving from fluid-air bed to a drum roaster will have a learning curve - am I essentially starting from scratch?

If anyone has other recommendations for a move up from the SR800, I am all ears. I would like to stay with electric, and ideally roast in the kitchen still under the exhaust fan. I would like to be able to roast about a 1 lb batch, so maybe 550 g of greens? As I mentioned, I am only roasting for us and the occasional gift, so I don't want to spend a crazy amount on it... the Bullet seemed like it would be getting up there at over $6K CAD - and I haven't priced in any tariffs yet 🙄",2,1744129569.0,roasting,5,1.0,False

The voice of a mischievous being echoes in your mind. ""Well well, looks like you've stumbled upon my realm. I’m feeling generous, so you get to pick 1 out of 6 perks. Choose wisely, for it’ll shape your fate, and I’m not responsible for any weird consequences. I’ll be watching.""

**1. Reality Bender**  
With a mere thought, you can twist and shape the fabric of reality around you. Want to create a chair? Done. Need a cup of coffee? It's there. But it’s not just limited to inanimate objects—your thoughts can influence the flow of events, though only within certain limits. You can't change the past or make someone love you (no cheating on that front), but small alterations to the present are fair game.

**2. Memory Palace**  
Your mind is a fortress. Your memories are stored in an ever-expanding mental library, each event, conversation, and experience neatly categorized and accessible with ease. If you wish to forget something, you can simply lock it away. Your ability to focus, learn, and recall information is heightened exponentially, making you an absolute genius in anything you dedicate time to.

**3. The Eternal Observer**  
No one can hide from your gaze. Whether it's in a crowd or across a battlefield, you can always see the truth of things. You know where someone is looking, what they’re thinking, and how they truly feel. No more second-guessing intentions or motivations. You can even peer into the past or future briefly to see how things will unfold—though only for a short period ahead of time.

**4. Time's Lazy Apprentice**  
You’ve gained a mastery over time, but not in the way one might expect. You can manipulate the flow of time around you, speeding it up or slowing it down for brief moments. You can pause time for up to an hour a day, but only for personal use. The world around you stays still, but you can act as you wish, move, think, or even explore—just don't stay stuck in the pause for too long, or the flow will get you.

**5. Master of Shadows**  
Your connection to the shadows is absolute. You can meld into them, becoming invisible in any dimly lit environment. You can even travel short distances through them, slipping through the cracks and crevices of space as long as they’re in shadow. The deeper the darkness, the further you can go. Just be careful: too much time in the shadows may start to change you in unexpected ways.

**6. Cosmic Attunement**  
The universe hums with energy, and you’ve learned how to tune into it. Whether it's the stars, the elements, or the mysterious cosmic forces, you can channel this energy for a variety of effects. Healing, enhanced physical prowess, and even fleeting glimpses into the mysteries of existence become at your fingertips. The more in tune you are, the more you'll be able to manipulate the world around you with finesse.",9,1744129526.0,6Perks,13,0.92,False

1juhlen,https://www.reddit.com/r/MassageTherapists/comments/1juhlen/advice_for_pricing_at_new_location/,Advice for pricing at new location,"Hello! Posting looking for advice for my boyfriend, he's been an LMT for awhile now but not on reddit much.

He was working at a Hand & Stone (chain spa), and was the most requested therapist there for about 5 years before moving into a location that he shared with a classmate. Since moving he's been doing pretty well for himself at his office and doing mobile visits through Soothe. He specialized in deep tissue at H&S, but now tends to do a mix of deep tissue and swedish and has been doing good like that for about 3 yrs. His normal pricing is 135/hr in the northeast San Antonio area in TX.

The office he was sharing with his classmate was cheap at 600/mo, but while he had his room looking fairly plush and nice, there was much to be desired in the building. He was constantly having to sweep up dead bugs in his office. There was no waiting area so clients would have to wait in the car if he had back-to-back so he could reset the room. The outside while not ghetto, was definitely older looking (paint peeling, poorly tended landscape, etc). The bathrooms especially were pretty bad, the lights would flicker,  the plastic/vinyl countertop was stained and had rings, the cleaning supplies were out in the open,  the paper towels would just sit on the counter and get wet, the faucets were coated in lime deposits, there were always spiders in the corners of the stalls, I had ants crawl in a line past my feet once, the doors to the stalls would stick to the point of having to yank or shove, and some of the toilet paper holders were broken. 

He had clients tell him they loved his work, but would not refer him to their friends or family due to the location. 

Recently, he went and took a week long in person certification course in manual lymph drainage,  and then a weekend in person course on post op lymphatic. He plans on getting certified for edema drainage as well, and maybe gua sha. He picked up a course on Brazilian wood body contouring too.

Also recently he found an office to rent at a medspa in shavano park, a nicer area of town with a more bougie clientele. The medspa has a large posh looking lobby, a receptionist to greet the clients, coffee/tea/water/wine for the clients, and the whole space is very clean, well designed/decorated, well lit, has multiple awards scattered around, and a social media manager that he can work with. The bathrooms are also very nice, with fancy soaps and a selfie mirror. There is also a before&after room with a posture grid he can use. The space is a bit smaller but looks absolutely amazing compared to his old one, @1000/mo. He will not be sharing with his classmate as she will have to stop soon for personal reasons.

Because he's not familiar with the area, it's such a big upgrade to the environment, and there aren't many that do lymph drain in town, he's a little unsure of what to price himself at. Other services at the medspa include a $200 facial, fillers for $800, cryotherapy (which will be reffering for lymph drainage) anywhere from $3-8k, and specialty fillers for like $3.2k. There is also a tennis club across the street, a diabetes clinic, and a cosmetic surgical consultant in the same small section of buildings. 

Any suggestions/ideas on pricing? The few prices we have found on lymph drainage around here seem like mostly from chains, at like 130-150/hr. He was hoping to bump it up a bit from that based on the other services in his location, and from the higher end market of the area. He has about 10 yrs experience now and even his instructors for the lymph classes would complement his flow and pressure variation, having him help some of the other students.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I didn't see anything in the rules for this sub against posting regarding prices so I hope it's okay, sorry if this was a little long!

PS he was also thinking on doing a 'move in' promo for new clients, and letting some of his regulars/long time clients at the lower rate for a few sessions before bumping the price up for them.",3,1744129191.0,MassageTherapists,3,1.0,False

Building an Expressive Voice AI Companion: Full-Stack Technical Guide

Sesame’s Maya – a voice-to-voice AI companion – has set a new bar for human-like speech interactions. Users have described conversations with Maya as startlingly lifelike, noting “hesitations, lowering her voice when she confided… it wasn’t exactly like \[my friend\], but close enough”​

pcworld.com. Achieving this level of realism requires integrating multiple AI components: from speech recognition and language understanding to nuanced speech synthesis with emotion. This guide explores the full stack needed to build such a system, leveraging public knowledge and state-of-the-art open-source projects. We’ll break down the architecture into key components – Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding & Generation (NLU/NLG), Dialogue Management & Memory, Text-to-Speech (TTS), Emotional Prosody Modeling, Voice Cloning & Zero-Shot Synthesis, and Integration & Deployment – providing technical insights and references at each step.



Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

At the front-end of a voice AI companion is the speech-to-text engine that converts the user’s spoken input into text. The goal is to achieve highly accurate transcription with low latency, even in conversational settings with various accents, noise, or informal speech. Modern ASR models based on deep learning have reached impressive levels of accuracy and robustness:

OpenAI Whisper – an open-source Transformer-based ASR – “approaches human level robustness and accuracy on English speech recognition”​openai.com. Whisper was trained on 680k hours of multilingual data, making it resilient to accents and background noise​ openai.com. It achieves about 50% fewer errors on diverse test sets compared to previous models​ openai.com. Whisper can transcribe in real-time on consumer GPUs (with smaller models for faster performance) and handle multiple languages and even translation. Its end-to-end architecture takes 30-second audio chunks and outputs text with token-level timestamps​ openai.com.

Facebook Wav2Vec 2.0 – a self-supervised pretraining approach for ASR – introduced learning speech representations from unlabeled audio and fine-tuning on labeled data. Models like Wav2Vec2 (and derivatives like HuBERT, XLS-R) are available via Hugging Face and can be fine-tuned for specific domains. These models brought high accuracy with less supervised data by leveraging massive unlabeled audio.

NVIDIA NeMo ASR – an ASR toolkit with pretrained models (e.g. Citrinet, Conformer-Transducer) optimized for streaming. NeMo models can be deployed with NVIDIA’s Riva SDK for real-time transcription. “NVIDIA Riva is a set of GPU-accelerated speech microservices for building real-time conversational AI”​ nvidia.com– including ASR and TTS – which can be useful for deploying an always-listening companion on devices or servers.

For a DIY implementation, developers can use Hugging Face’s Transformers to load a ready ASR model. For example, using Whisper via the Transformers pipeline:

pythonCopyimport torch

from transformers import pipeline



asr = pipeline(""automatic-speech-recognition"", model=""openai/whisper-base"")

\# Record or load audio (assumed 16kHz WAV)

text\_output = asr(""path/to/user\_audio.wav"")\[""text""\]

print(""Transcribed text:"", text\_output)



This yields the recognized text for the user’s speech. Whisper supports longer audio by segmenting internally; for continuous dialogue, one can stream audio chunks and use voice activity detection (VAD) to determine when the user has finished speaking. Ensuring low latency is important – smaller ASR models or quantization can help, though at some loss of accuracy. The ASR component feeds into the next stage once the user’s utterance is transcribed.

Natural Language Understanding & Generation (NLU/NLG)

Once we have the user’s words, the system must understand the user’s intent or query and generate an appropriate response. In modern conversational AI, large language models (LLMs) often handle both understanding and generation in a unified step, taking the conversation history as input and producing the next reply. To achieve human-like responsiveness and coherence, we leverage advanced NLP models:

Large Language Models for Dialogue: Models like GPT-4 (OpenAI), PaLM 2 (Google), or open alternatives like Llama 2 can be used to power the AI’s “brain.” Fine-tuned dialogue models (with instruction-following and personality conditioning) are ideal. For example, Vicuna-13B is an open model shown to reach “more than 90% of ChatGPT’s quality” in conversation, based on GPT-4 evaluations​ [lmsys.org](http://lmsys.org), making it a strong candidate for an on-premise assistant. These models can interpret nuanced user input and generate contextually appropriate, fluent replies.

Natural Language Understanding (NLU): In a voice assistant context, classical NLU might involve parsing intents and entities (e.g., using Rasa or IBM Watson Assistant). However, a companion like Maya engages in open-ended dialogue rather than fixed domains, so intent classification is less relevant. Instead, the model’s understanding is implicit in the LLM’s next-sentence prediction. That said, one can incorporate tools: e.g. sentiment analysis or emotion detection on the user’s text to gauge tone. There are open libraries (Hugging Face models or Speech Emotion Recognition toolkits​medium.com) that analyze text or audio for sentiment/emotion, which the system could use to adjust its response style (more on this in Emotional Prosody section).

Natural Language Generation (NLG): Using an LLM, the response can be generated with a certain persona and style. For a consistent character (like Maya), developers provide a system prompt or fine-tune the model to speak as a friendly, empathetic companion. For example, a system prompt might say: “You are Maya, an AI assistant with a warm, expressive personality. Respond with empathy and humor when appropriate, and maintain a casual, friendly tone.” This guides the model’s generations. Fine-tuning on dialogue transcripts can further improve consistency.

Dialogue context: To maintain coherence over a conversation, the last several turns are typically fed into the model (within its context window). Advanced systems incorporate long-term memory beyond the context window – e.g., by summarizing earlier conversations or storing facts about the user (name, preferences) and injecting them into prompts when relevant. Vector databases (Pinecone, FAISS) can store embeddings of past dialogues or knowledge and retrieve them as needed. This helps the AI recall prior details and avoid repetitiveness. While current LLMs can handle a few thousand tokens of context, long-term companions likely need a strategy to retain important information (this could be a semantic memory module that the dialogue manager consults).

In summary, the NLU/NLG backbone of a voice AI companion will typically be a conversational LLM that transforms the user’s text input into a thoughtful reply, possibly augmented by additional NLU tools for specific tasks. The output is a textual response that then must be converted to speech.

Dialogue Management & Memory

A truly interactive voice companion requires more than generating text turn by turn. Dialogue management provides structure to the conversation: handling turn-taking, context tracking, and ensuring the AI’s responses are appropriate and on-topic. Key considerations include:

Turn-Taking and Interruptions: Human conversations have natural turn-taking dynamics. Maya, for example, supports interruption – users can interject while she’s speaking, and she will stop, much like a human conversation partner ​techcrunch.com. Implementing this requires the system to monitor the microphone even while speaking; a spike in the user’s voice input triggers the TTS to pause or stop. The pipeline must run ASR continuously and be able to cancel ongoing TTS output when a barge-in is detected. This can be handled by a barge-in detector (often implemented via a VAD on the user’s audio stream). Dialogue manager coordinates this: e.g., suspending the response if the user interrupted with a clarification.

Context Tracking: The dialogue manager keeps track of conversational context – recent dialogue history (for the LLM input), as well as any dialogue state. In task-oriented systems, state might include slots (for example, in a travel booking dialogue). In an open-ended companion, state might be minimal, but could involve the AI’s persona state (mood, or any remembered facts). Some implementations use memory modules that store facts extracted from conversation (e.g., “User’s favorite coffee is latte”) and re-inject them when relevant (“You mentioned before you like latte; want me to order one?”). This can be done by storing such facts and using a retrieval step before generation, or by fine-tuning the model to have a long-term memory (an active area of research).

Ensuring Coherence and Safety: The dialogue manager may also include filters or guards. For example, if the user asks something fact-based, it might route the query to a knowledge base or tool (like a search engine) and then have the LLM incorporate that result (this is the idea of tool use or retrieval augmented generation). For an AI companion, factual queries might not be the focus, but personal advice or chit-chat is, which the base model can handle. It’s wise to include some safety filter on the LLM’s output to avoid problematic responses. Open-source models won’t have OpenAI’s guardrails by default, so applying a moderation model or heuristic to the generated text before speaking it can prevent obvious issues.

Persona and Style consistency: The manager ensures the AI stays in character. This might involve appending a reminder of the persona in each prompt for generation. Sesame’s Maya was noted for maintaining a consistent personality, which builds trust​aimresearch.co. The system should not suddenly change speaking style or forget past interactions (unless intentionally resetting). Techniques like one-shot prompting with example dialogues or using specialized fine-tunes (e.g., a custom dataset of the AI persona interacting) can enforce this consistency.

In practice, many implementations combine the dialogue management within the LLM prompting itself for simplicity (relying on the model’s capability to handle context and some tool use via prompting). However, advanced developers can create a hybrid system: e.g., a lightweight manager that decides if a query is small-talk vs. a command vs. a knowledge query, etc., and then uses the appropriate module. For the scope of a personal companion, a single LLM is usually sufficient for generating responses, with the main complexity in handling interruptions and long-term memory.

Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis

The hallmark of a voice AI like Maya is the speech output – it must sound natural, expressive, and alive. Modern TTS has moved from robotic voices to near-human quality through deep learning. The core of a TTS system involves converting the response text (and possibly additional context cues) into audible speech. The state-of-the-art approaches include:

Neural TTS Models: Traditional TTS pipelines separated text analysis, acoustic modeling, and vocoding. Now end-to-end or two-stage neural models dominate:

Autoregressive models: Tacotron 2 (Seq-to-seq LSTM with attention) was a breakthrough that generates mel spectrograms from text, which a vocoder (like WaveGlow or WaveRNN) then converts to waveform. Tacotron2 can produce natural sounding speech, especially when trained on a single speaker with expressive data, but can suffer from slow inference or occasional errors (mispronunciations, etc.).

Non-autoregressive and Fast models: FastSpeech and FastPitch (by NVIDIA) generate speech in parallel (no autoregressive decoder), enabling faster inference. FastPitch, for instance, predicts pitch contours along with spectrograms, allowing control over intonation ​catalog.ngc.nvidia.com. These models paired with a GAN-based vocoder (like HiFi-GAN) can produce high-quality audio quickly. NVIDIA’s open models (e.g., FastPitch + HiFi-GAN for multi-speaker English​catalog.ngc.nvidia.com) are available on NGC and Hugging Face.

End-to-end with Vocoder integrated: Models like VITS (2021) unify the acoustic model and vocoder into one flow-based model, directly generating waveforms. VITS can produce very natural speech and is adaptable to multi-speaker. Many open-source TTS projects (Coqui TTS, Ming-Soft, etc.) offer VITS or similar.

Expressive and Conversational TTS: A key challenge is the one-to-many mapping in speech: a given text can be spoken in countless ways (tones, speeds) depending on context. Without additional input, a TTS model might choose a neutral style by default. To make the speech conversational:

Use contextual inputs: Sesame’s approach with Maya was to feed conversation history into the TTS system. Their Conversational Speech Model (CSM) is a single-stage transformer taking both text and recent audio as input, and generating audio tokens​ sesame.com ​sesame.com. By leveraging conversation context, it chooses intonations that fit the moment. In fact, CSM uses a Llama language model backbone with an audio decoder, jointly modeling text and audio tokens​techcrunch.com. This lets it produce subtle prosody variations like thoughtful pauses or upbeat tones when appropriate.

Use explicit prosody features: Another method is to annotate the text with desired style cues or to have a model predict prosody attributes. For example, one could run a secondary model that analyzes the dialogue state or the user’s emotion and outputs a set of prosody controls (like “excited” vs “calm”, or a numeric energy level). Some TTS systems allow tags (SSML or custom) to control speaking style, e.g., <express-as style=""excited"">Sure, sounds great!</express-as>. In open-source, research like style tokens provides a way to control such factors (see Global Style Tokens which learn a set of style embeddings capturing prosodic variation​ research.google​research.google).

High-Fidelity Vocoding: Converting the intermediate acoustic representation to actual sound is done by a vocoder. Neural vocoders like WaveGlow, WaveRNN, HiFi-GAN, UnivNet, etc., can generate 22kHz audio that sounds very clear. HiFi-GAN in particular is popular in many projects for its quality and speed trade-off. For real-time applications, one might use a slightly faster, slightly lower-quality vocoder to reduce latency, or even generate at 16kHz instead of 24kHz to save compute.

Breaths and non-verbal cues: To avoid the “flatness” of typical TTS, adding human-like touches is important. Real humans breathe and sometimes say fillers like “um”, laugh, or sigh. Some modern models learn to include these if present in training data. For instance, Sesame’s demo voices “take breaths and speak with disfluencies” (natural pauses, “uhm”)​techcrunch.com. The open-source Bark model is notable here: “Bark can generate highly realistic speech as well as other audio – including music, background noise and nonverbal communications like laughing, sighing and crying.”​github.com. Bark treats TTS as a fully generative audio task, so it might inject a chuckle or a short breath sound where appropriate, making the speech feel less robotic. Using such models or augmenting training data with nonverbal sounds (and corresponding tokens in text like “\[laugh\]”) can give the voice more character.

In practice, to build the TTS component for a companion, you have options:

Use an open pre-trained TTS: For example, ElevenLabs (closed-source API) has ultra-realistic voices, but open-source alternatives are emerging. Sesame released CSM-1B which “produces a variety of voices” as a base model​techcrunch.com. Although fine-tuning is needed for a specific persona, one could take CSM-1B or other models from HuggingFace and adapt them. Another example is Tortoise TTS, an open-source system emphasizing realism: “Tortoise is built with priorities: (1) strong multi-voice capabilities, (2) highly realistic prosody and intonation.”​github.com It uses an autoregressive + diffusion decoder and was once very slow, but optimizations have improved it (reports of \~0.3× real-time with streaming)​github.com. Tortoise can be used to generate extremely natural speech given a reference voice (more on that in the next section).

Train a custom voice model: With datasets of high-quality recorded speech, one can fine-tune a multi-speaker model to a new voice or train from scratch. For example, training a FastPitch+HiFiGAN on an expressive dataset (like audiobooks or dialog corpus) and then fine-tuning on a target voice can produce a very natural personalized TTS. NVIDIA NeMo, Facebook’s Fairseq S2S, or ESPnet are toolkits that provide recipes for training TTS models with emotional or stylistic control. Academic projects like DiffProsody even explore diffusion models to generate prosody for expressive [TTS​github.com​github.com](http://TTS​github.com​github.com), indicating the cutting edge of research in making speech more lifelike.

Example – Generating speech with Sesame’s CSM: The CSM-1B model on HuggingFace can be used to generate audio given text and an optional audio context. For instance:

pythonCopyfrom sesame\_csm import load\_csm\_1b  # hypothetical import from Sesame's repo

gen = load\_csm\_1b(device=""cuda"")

speech\_wav = gen.generate(

text=""Hello, how can I help you today?"",

speaker=0,        # speaker ID or embedding (0 could be default voice)

context=\[\]        # could include previous dialogue audio tokens for context

)

with open(""output.wav"", ""wb"") as f:

f.write(speech\_wav)



This would produce a WAV file of the AI speaking the given text. Under the hood, CSM uses a single-stage transformer to directly output audio tokens, which are finally decoded to waveform​

huggingface.co​huggingface.co. Notably, CSM (1B parameters) uses a Llama transformer as the text/audio encoder and a smaller decoder that generates audio codec tokens (specifically, Mimi or EnCodec codes)​huggingface.co. This design is efficient and allows the model to capture the conversation nuances in speech generation. A fine-tuned version of this model powers Maya’s actual voice in the demo​huggingface.co.



Emotional Prosody and Expressiveness

Human communication isn’t just words – how we say something carries meaning. Achieving emotional and prosodic expressiveness in an AI voice is crucial to making it feel “alive.” In our system, there are a few places where emotion and style can be injected or accounted for:

Emotion Recognition from User: The companion might adjust its response if it senses the user is sad, happy, angry, etc. This can be done by analyzing the user’s voice tone or words. For instance, using a speech emotion recognition model (many open implementations exist​medium.com) on the user’s audio can yield an emotion label. If the user sounds upset, the AI’s response text can be made more sympathetic (the NLG component can be prompted to respond with empathy, e.g., “I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. I’m here for you.”). This is part of the “Emotional intelligence” Sesame highlighted – the AI reading and responding to emotional context​aimresearch.co.

Prosody tags in NLG: The language generation step can output not just plain text, but text annotated with cues for the TTS. For example, an LLM could be asked to produce responses in a format like: <tone=excited>Great news! You got the job!</tone> vs <tone=calm>I think that would be fine.</tone>. This requires either a custom decoding or fine-tune where the model learns to include such tokens. The TTS then interprets these tags to modulate pitch, energy, and speaking rate. While this is a complex setup, it’s feasible – essentially treating prosody control as a sequence to be generated. Alternatively, the dialogue manager can decide on a tone and directly feed that into the TTS (for instance, selecting a different “emotion embedding” for the TTS model).

Multi-style TTS models: Some TTS architectures explicitly model style/emotion. For example, the Style Tokens approach adds a bank of latent embeddings that capture dimensions of style (e.g., soft vs. tense, high-pitch vs. low)​proceedings.mlr.press​research.google. During training on an expressive dataset, the model learns these token embeddings. At inference, you can mix and match these tokens to get the desired style, even without an external reference audio. Another approach is training models on an emotion-labeled dataset (like the CREMA-D or EMOVO corpus) and conditioning on the emotion label (happy, sad, angry, etc.). There are research works achieving this by adding an emotion one-hot or embedding input to Tacotron or VITS. Open-source implementations (e.g., some Coqui-TTS examples) allow specifying an emotion for TTS if the model was trained on a multi-emotion dataset.

Prosody Prediction models: A more modular approach is to have a model predict prosody features (like a pitch contour or speaking rate) given the text and context, and then feed those into the TTS. For instance, a predictor might say: this sentence should be spoken with a slight downward pitch at the end (to sound calming). The TTS then uses that. NVIDIA’s FastPitch inherently predicts pitch values from [text​catalog.ngc.nvidia.com](http://text​catalog.ngc.nvidia.com), which can be influenced or even manually set. Others have used variational models to sample prosody – e.g., a VAE that learns a distribution of possible prosodies for a given text (Tacotron with GST can be seen this way, where sampling different style tokens yields different prosodies).

In Sesame’s blog, they mention that without context, TTS models struggle because “there are countless valid ways to speak a sentence, but only some fit a given setting”​

sesame.com. Their solution (CSM) essentially makes prosody selection part of a learned, context-driven process. Our system can mimic that by always giving the TTS model enough context (previous dialogue or explicit tags) to choose the right style. For example, if the previous user turn was angry and loud, the AI might respond more carefully and softly; a context-aware TTS could infer that from the conversation history, or we explicitly instruct it.



To illustrate emotional prosody control with existing tools, consider an example using Coqui TTS (which has multi-speaker and some emotional models). One could do:

pythonCopyimport torch

from TTS.api import TTS



\# Load a multi-speaker, multi-style TTS model (fictional model id for demo)

tts = TTS(model\_name=""tts\_model\_with\_emotions"")

sentence = ""Oh, I’m really excited about this!""

wav\_default = tts.tts(sentence)



\# Synthesize with a specified style or emotion (if model supports it)

wav\_happy = tts.tts(sentence, speaker=""john"", emotion=""happy"")

wav\_sad   = tts.tts(""I’m sorry... I really am."", speaker=""john"", emotion=""sad"")



If the model was trained with emotion labels, the outputs would have noticeably different tone. In practice, one must have a model that supports these parameters. Projects like Microsoft’s Custom Neural Voice (Azure Cognitive Services) allow exactly this kind of fine-grained emotive tuning via tags (though not open-source). Open-source is catching up via research like DiffProsody​

[github.com](http://github.com) and others that aim to generate expressive speech with controllable aspects.



Voice Cloning and Zero-Shot Voice Synthesis

To create a persona voice that is extremely human-like, one often needs to clone a specific voice or be able to generate new voices with minimal data (zero- or few-shot). Maya’s voice sounds unique and familiar, likely achieved by fine-tuning the base TTS on a target voice actor. Public research and tools on voice cloning include:

Speaker Embeddings + TTS pipeline (SV2TTS): A classic approach introduced by Jia et al. (2018) is a three-stage pipeline: (1) a speaker encoder that, given a short sample of a speaker’s voice, produces a fixed embedding vector representing that voice’s characteristics; (2) a sequence-to-sequence TTS (like Tacotron) that takes text and a speaker embedding to generate speech (mel spectrogram) in that voice; (3) a vocoder to produce waveform. This pipeline was implemented in an open-source project by Corentin Jemine, called Real-Time Voice Cloning. It allows cloning from as little as 5 seconds of audio​syncedreview.com​syncedreview.com. The speaker encoder model was often based on GE2E (generalized end-to-end speaker verification)​syncedreview.com. The result is that you could record a few seconds of a person’s voice and then synthesize arbitrary phrases in that voice. While the quality is good, it might not capture all nuances of the voice with just 5 seconds – more data (like a minute or a few samples) improves it. This technique provides a baseline for voice cloning with relatively low resource use. Many forks and improvements exist on GitHub for different languages and better vocoders.

Neural Codec Language Models: A newer paradigm (exemplified by VALL-E from Microsoft) views TTS as a conditional language modeling task on discrete audio tokens​microsoft.com. Models like VALL-E use an audio codec (e.g. EnCodec) to turn waveform into discrete codes, then train a Transformer to predict those codes from text, conditioned on a prompt audio sample of the target speaker. VALL-E demonstrated zero-shot voice synthesis: given just a 3-second sample of a never-seen speaker, it can produce speech in that voice, preserving the speaker’s timbre and even their emotion and acoustic environment​microsoft.com. The paper reported significantly better naturalness and speaker similarity than prior zero-shot TTS systems​microsoft.com. Extensions like VALL-E X handle cross-lingual voice cloning (speak in another language with the cloned voice)​microsoft.com, and VALL-E 2 claims to reach “human parity” in zero-shot TTS on certain benchmarks​microsoft.com, which is remarkable. Microsoft hasn’t open-sourced VALL-E, but the ideas have influenced open projects – for instance, the Bark model by Suno also uses a transformer with discrete audio tokens and can do voice prompting (cloning). There’s also an open re-implementation called VALL-E X (open) on GitHub​github.com that provides a trained model for experimentation.

Fine-tuning multi-speaker TTS: If you have data for the target voice (say you record an actor for 1-2 hours), you can fine-tune a model like CSM or a multi-speaker Tacotron on that data to get a very high-quality cloned voice. This isn’t zero-shot (you need training), but it’s a direct way to produce a custom voice. Given that Sesame’s open model CSM-1B is base (no specific voice)​techcrunch.com, one would fine-tune it on, say, an audiobook of a person to get that person’s voice in the model. The Apache 2.0 license​techcrunch.com means you can do this and use it commercially (with ethical caveats). Indeed, the TechCrunch report noted a user could clone their voice in under a minute using Sesame’s demo​techcrunch.com. The “magic sauce” for Maya’s realism is likely a combination of this cloning with the expressive engine – i.e., Maya’s voice is a fine-tuned model on a voice actor who gave many expressive recordings, so the model learned not just the timbre but the expressive range of that actor.

Open-source tools for voice cloning include projects like Resemble AI’s SDK (not fully open, but has some developer APIs), and academic code from papers like YourTTS (which was a multilingual zero-shot TTS model leveraging speaker embeddings). NVIDIA’s NeMo also has a tutorial on cloning a voice by fine-tuning their FastPitch model on as little as 10 minutes of audio – thanks to transfer learning, it can capture a new voice from few samples.

One must also consider ethical and safety implications. The open models (like CSM-1B) have “no real safeguards” against misuse, relying on an honor system​

techcrunch.com. As developers, implementing restrictions or watermarking on generated audio may be wise if the application could be misused (impersonation etc.). Techniques like audio watermarking for AI speech or requiring user consent for cloning voices are areas of active discussion.



In summary, to get a voice like “Maya”:

Start with a high-quality multi-speaker base model (e.g. CSM-1B or Bark or Tacotron multi-speaker).

Fine-tune or prompt it with a target voice until the similarity is high.

Ensure this voice is expressive – the training data should include various emotions and speaking styles by that voice, so the model doesn’t produce a flat clone but one that laughs, pauses, and dynamically changes like the real person. Maya’s voice included subtle mannerisms that made it eerily human​pcworld.com.

Integration & Deployment Considerations

Bringing all these components together into a working system requires careful engineering. The final architecture of a voice AI companion like Maya might look like this:

Microphone input → ASR: Continuously listen and transcribe user speech. Use a VAD to decide when a full utterance is ready or when to interrupt.

ASR text → NLU/NLG (LLM): Feed the transcribed text (plus recent dialogue history and any retrieved memories) into the language model. Get the response text (and possibly meta-data like intended emotion of response).

Text → TTS: Synthesize the AI’s reply into speech. Use context to choose prosody: e.g., pass the last user utterance audio or an emotion tag into the TTS model. The TTS starts generating audio, possibly in a streaming fashion (some TTS models can output one chunk at a time so you don’t wait to finish entire sentence before playback).

Speaker (audio output): Play the generated speech through speakers/headphones for the user to hear.

Loop and Interruptions: While the AI is speaking, keep the ASR running in the background. If the user starts talking, detect it (barge-in) and stop the TTS playback/generation immediately, then process the new user speech. This makes the conversation fluid and interactive.

A few important technical points in deployment:

Latency and Real-Time Performance: The entire loop from user finishing a sentence to AI beginning its reply should ideally be a few hundred milliseconds to a second – beyond that, the dialogue feels laggy. To achieve this, each component must be optimized:

Use fast ASR (streaming Conformer or Whisper small) that can return partial transcripts mid-sentence if needed.

Possibly start formulating the response before the user finishes (advanced trick: if ASR is streaming, an LLM can start formulating an answer with partial input, though this is hard to do reliably).

Use a GPU for parallel processing: one thread for ASR, one for TTS, etc. Running multiple models concurrently can hide some latency (for example, start TTS generation of the beginning of the reply while the LLM is still finishing the end of the text – if using a neural TTS that can be run in parallel with text generation).

The one-stage CSM model is advantageous because it “improves efficiency and expressivity” by not needing a separate TTS pipeline​sesame.com. If one could integrate the LLM for text and the CSM for speech into one model, that might save time – Sesame hinted at using Llama for both language and speech in a multimodal way. For now, we typically keep them separate.

Scalability: If this is deployed on a device (like Sesame’s vision of AR glasses​techcrunch.com), you might need to shrink models or use on-device acceleration (e.g., Qualcomm AI SDK). If deployed on a server, you might handle multiple concurrent users – containerize each component or use an optimized runtime like NVIDIA Riva (which allows running ASR/TTS as microservices with TensorRT optimization). Riva, for example, provides gRPC endpoints for ASR and TTS that run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs, supporting real-time streaming for many parallel sessions​nvidia.com.

Frameworks: Many developers use higher-level frameworks to glue the pieces:

Hugging Face Transformers for easy loading of ASR and text models.

LangChain or custom code for managing the dialogue and prompt assembly.

Grpc or Socket IO for streaming audio in/out if the client and server are separate.

WebRTC if building a web-based voice chat (WebRTC provides low-latency audio streaming and also has built-in echo cancellation and VAD, which can be handy).

Python libraries like sounddevice or pyaudio to capture microphone audio, and simple media playback libraries to play audio output.

Testing and Tuning: Building a human-like voice AI is as much an art as engineering. It requires iterative tuning:

Adjust the prompts given to the LLM to steer the personality (to avoid it going into unwanted topics or styles).

Tune the speech speed and pause lengths. Some TTS engines allow adjusting the global speaking rate and volume. Slightly slower speech with natural pauses can make it feel more thoughtful, whereas too fast feels unnatural. Maya likely has carefully tuned cadence – neither too machine-perfect nor too slow.

Evaluate with humans: As Sesame did, having testers converse and give feedback on where it felt off. They even created a new evaluation suite for contextual voice quality​sesame.com, since existing metrics were saturated. One could use MOS (mean opinion score) evaluations or AB tests where listeners compare AI vs human utterances. In fact, Sesame reported that without context, people had “no clear preference between generated and real speech”, indicating how close they got​sesame.com.

Continual Learning: A companion might improve over time, learning the user’s lexicon or adjusting its voice. One could adapt the TTS model on the user’s own voice if the persona is supposed to mimic the user (some apps do that for accessibility, cloning the user’s voice as the assistant’s voice). Also, as more conversation data with the user accumulates, fine-tuning the LLM on the user’s dialogues (with consent) could make it more personalized. These are advanced steps that come after the initial system is up.

In conclusion, constructing an AI like Sesame’s Maya involves integrating cutting-edge speech and language AI components. The “magical” realism comes from a synergy of techniques: robust speech recognition, a powerful language model maintaining a personable dialogue, and an expressive TTS that leverages context and emotion to produce voice output rich with human-like nuances. By using open-source models such as Whisper for ASR, Llama/Vicuna for NLG, and Bark/CSM/Tortoise for TTS (augmented with prosody and voice cloning techniques), an advanced ML developer can assemble a voice companion that “crosses the uncanny valley” of voice​

Each component must be tuned and combined thoughtfully – but public resources today provide a strong starting point. The open-source release of Sesame’s CSM-1B is a testament to how the community can now experiment with near state-of-the-art conversational voice synthesis​

I'm going to be filming some content for a small budget production later this month at Kitsilano Beach. I'm trying to figure out if there are any food trucks, even coffee carts or chip trucks, near the park. Or is it too early in the season for food trucks?

If anyone knows of one, I'd reach out directly to the business to request to film in front of their truck. Help is super appreciated! ",1,1744129145.0,askvan,1,1.0,False

Not together it depends on what  my week looks like .
I’m vegan and diet changes according to what medication I’ve taken :

- on Vyvanse, I take it in the morning with water, and after or during eating a protein shake. And I try to stay off ascorbic acid and anything else that can cause the effects to go down throughout the day, on Vyvanse I only drink caffeine in the morning but I might smoke a lot to compensate, for something IDK why or what ; I take it on weeks that I need to be both physically and mentally attentive. Like days that I have college presentations, house chores, “hand on” assignments, etc it works when I’m doing intellectual only work but I still struggle to concentrate and get things done if I have to sit down to do it.

- on Concerta I take in the morning, with water while fasting, and I don’t eat anything for around 2h to 6h after taking it. What I eat doesn’t change much on the effects but anything citric or too carby will slow down the medication; I take it when I only have to do intellectual work. If I have a lot of physical work or activity to do I will likely forget to eat and I will either have a migraine the next day or just come down off it really exhausted. I’m also more impulsive on concerta so I try to only take it when I have written assignments and/or reading to do. I can drink caffeine as much as I want and I rarely feel any negative symptoms from it. 

- sometimes I drink orange juice or lemonade to shorten the effects of the medication so I can sleep or just take a break;
- even on Vyvanse I might drink coffee instead of taking more medication;

My rambling is to ask, does anyone knows of an app or website, that would calculate how my medication is being affected by what I eat? And how’s that affecting my health and well being?

An app that does things like for example  : if I eat and chickpea wrap is it enough proteins for it to not affect my medication negatively; 
And that tells me things like : am I eating enough for someone my high and weight (I don’t want to lose weight although I’m partial to gaining muscles); 
Or that tells me when my proteins weren’t enough of that I need to take another dose of medication bc I haven’t eaten enough calories or proteins or nutrients yet.

Is there something like this?

Main thing is feeling less productive overall and the secondary would be not getting that morning buzz to feel motivated. 

It’s better when I get good sleep the night before and wake up in time to get to the gym but been stressing about my business which affects my sleep and the next day makes me want coffee even more to make up for the tiredness and lack of productivity.
