I'm 30, she's 28. We don’t work together directly since she’s in a different department. I found out she lives near me, so we walked home together, and I casually suggested grabbing a coffee at work. The next day, we actually did, had a short chat, and the vibe felt good.

I don’t usually make moves at work, but it seemed like she was open to it. The following day, we chatted a lot online, and I suggested grabbing cocktails tonight, which she agreed to. But over the last day or two, her replies have slowed down, and earlier today, she said she’d rather just go for a walk tonight instead.

Not sure what to make of this. Did she change her mind but doesn’t want to cancel outright because we work together? Or is she still interested but prefers something more low-key? What do you guys think?",1,1742745991.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I have self diagnosed mast cell issues at my gut level due to food reactions which are not high histamine. Everything with salicylates causes pouding heart and agitation. Lectins make me feel like I drank 100 coffees. I do also get headaches from smoke, cold sensitivity, flushing so I might have a more general mast cell manifestation. I didn't seek a diagnosis for this due to doctor scarcity. 

However, this sub brought Ketotifen to my attention. A few months ago I read the prescription and it mentioned the usual airway and nose symptom ammelioration. Didn't try it because I can relatively manage this through diet.

But a few days ago I read that Ketotifen also acts as a mast cell stabilizer and it also blocks some mast cell mediators - ok.... This sounds interesting.

Then saw that many people started tolerating more foods with this med! Great news!

So I told myself to give it a try. First pharmacy asked for a prescription which I didn't have. The other pharmacies I visited sold me all the boxes they had without a prescription. I then went to my GP and asked for a Ketotifen prescription. He was surprised when I mentioned food, but told him that many people get reduced food reactions and he happily wrote a prescription.

Now I kid you not. I have a coffee issue, I'm trying to quit because it causes palpitations and hyperactivity. But after my 2nd dose of ketotifen, the palpitations reduced by 90% and my mind is considerably calmer. I even ate some beans (which I avoid like the plague) and got only negligable symptoms.

I'll end with.... Thanks to everyone on this sub for providing what worked for them. I'm a bit hyped right now because I can't believe how good it is. Hope I'm not wrong and if so... I will write another post.

As we are all very aware of by now, 8x11 gave us some very interesting added context about the BuckTommy relationship through Tommy’s perspective: Tommy admits to seeing Eddie as competition for Buck’s heart throughout their relationship. I generally don’t talk *a lot* about Tommy because I just don’t have much to say that I haven’t already said or that hasn’t been said by someone else, but what I am interested in is writing choices and foreshadowing. This made me interested in going through the BuckTommy scenes that we were presented with now with the context of this added information.

A quick disclaimer: I’m sure many of us are aware of how I feel about Tommy as a character, and I am sure most of you feel very similarly to me. With this write-up, though, I’m gonna try to hold my bias and analyze through an objective lens of what was presented through the scenes (though if you like Tommy’s character and the BuckTommy relationship, this post will probably still seem biased). I will not, however, be adding my own feelings or criticisms about Tommy’s lines or actions throughout the seasons, just what is actually occurring and what his recently mentioned feelings add to the context of these scenes. This will be a long one, so bear with me, and while I think I hit all the major scenes, feel free to let me know if I missed anything. I know this is *insanely* long, so I split it up by episode in bold, so you can skip around if you want.

**7x03 “Capsized”**

As a quick recap, Tommy first shows up again in 7x03 to help with the cruise ship emergency. We don’t see any major BuckTommy interactions, except for a small moment at the end where we see Eddie walk off. Tommy is about to follow him before Buck stops him with a hand on his shoulder, seemingly to express gratitude for the rescue. 

There’s a few different ways to read this scene depending on what you think about the whole relationship, to be honest. If you buy into the theory of Tommy liking Eddie first, some have read this scene as Tommy chasing after a clueless Eddie before Buck interjects. Or this could also be a simple sign of the BuckTommy relationship that is about to come.

At the end of the day, though, this is one of the first of many times that Buck, Eddie, and Tommy are shaped into a love triangle-esque formation where one stands between the other two (this time with Tommy in the middle). If we really want to read into it (and assume that Tim always planned to have this jealousy from Tommy occur), this could be the first sign of many to come where Eddie is put in the middle of various BuckTommy interactions.

**7x04 “Buck, Bothered, and Bewildered”**

The famous Bi Buck episode that started it all. I’m sure it’s not necessary, but to give a quick recap: Tommy has become friends with Eddie, leaving Buck feeling jealous over their newfound closeness. 

There are many scenes throughout this episode that might be the first moment where Tommy truly felt the closeness between Buck and Eddie. 

The first is a bit more of a stretch, but it could potentially be during Buck’s tour where Buck was very eager to mention that Eddie was in the army. While this could be a one off line, it does start a recurring theme where Buck and Eddie love to offhandedly mention one another. This can also be supplemented by Eddie’s excitement at the prospect of Tommy having multiple tickets to the Vegas fight, showcasing the bond Eddie and Buck have. At this point in time, though, the relationship being presented to Tommy still seems relatively friendly; however, it could be seen as the start.

The next noteworthy scene in this episode is the basketball game. While not showcasing the Buck and Eddie dynamic per se, this scene does heavily feature Buck’s jealousy of the newfound EddieTommy friendship (jealousy that through the eyes of a future partner could easily be seen as not at all platonic). Eddie announces Buck’s dislike of basketball in front of Tommy, meaning that Tommy is aware that Buck showed up to play a sport that he seems to hate.

We get the second shot of Buck-Tommy-Eddie in a classic love triangle formation, this time with Buck in the middle. Buck doesn’t exactly try to hide his own frustration. Coupled with Buck’s dislike for the sport, this likely made it quite evident to Tommy that Buck was here out of jealousy and feeling left out. And of course, this all leads to the infamous scene of Buck pushing Eddie and injuring his ankle. While the closeness of the friendship was likely yet to be fully discovered, this was likely the first time Tommy noticed the intensity of Buck’s feelings towards Eddie. While Buck saw his own feelings as possessiveness towards his role as Eddie’s best friend, Tommy likely clocked from this moment potential romantic feelings that Buck might harbor, leading to the final scene of the episode.

The kiss scene. Based on the dialogue of this scene, I think it is safe to assume that Tommy assumed Buck held feelings for Eddie that were beyond platonic.

>Tommy: “Obviously I’ve been causing some bad blood between you and Eddie, and I just want you to know that was never my intention.”

>Buck: “There’s no *bad blood*.”

>Tommy: “*Evan.*”

>Buck: “Really, no bad blood, just…bad behavior, and it’s all on my part. You guys didn’t do anything wrong. You and Eddie as buddies makes perfect sense.”

>Tommy: “Yeah, we do. You know he can have more than one friend, right?”

>Buck: “Uh, yes, I do know that.”

>Tommy: “I mean it’s not like I could ever replace you. Christopher would absolutely have something to say about that; that kid cannot shut up about you.”

From the get go, Buck, Eddie, and even Christopher have emphasized the importance of the roles they have in each other’s lives to Tommy. This, paired with Buck’s jealousy, likely indicated some sort of romantic potential to Tommy (especially if we are to think that by this point, Tommy already assumes that Eddie is not straight). 

Tommy emphasizes that his friendship with Eddie was never about Buck, seemingly attempting to take a step back from their dynamic at first. I mean, Buck mentioned Eddie an alarming number of times in this conversation alone (which narratively set up Eddie in the middle of the BuckTommy relationship even when he’s not physically present from the very beginning). Things shift, however, when Buck begins to indicate that it was really Tommy’s attention he was after. 

Giving Tommy the benefit of the doubt, we can assume that maybe Tommy thought he misunderstood the situation at hand. Through Tommy’s “My attention?” line, we can conclude that at first, he did assume that it was all about Eddie, until Buck told him otherwise. Taking Buck’s word for his own feelings (and obviously assuming Buck isn’t straight considering how he first read Buck’s feelings for Eddie as romantic), Tommy kisses him. While we can assume that maybe Tommy thought he was simply wrong about the situation at first, those thoughts about Buck and Eddie’s dynamic, especially Buck’s feelings towards it, already existed and likely grew as we dive into further scenes of Tommy witnessing Buck and Eddie’s closeness. 

But for now, the thoughts were likely there, but could easily be read as a misunderstanding considering how little time he has known them for.

**7x05: You Don’t Know Me**

Here’s where we really dive into Tommy beginning to see the Buck and Eddie dynamic for what it really is. Or what I like to call Buck having big feelings, Tommy catching on, and Eddie looking pretty and remaining *utterly clueless*.

Before the current perspective we’ve been given in the most recent episode, many assumed that Buck and Tommy’s first date was unsuccessful due to Tommy thinking that Buck was not ready for a serious relationship before first growing to understand what his queerness means to him. This changed after 8x11.

“I guess it’s just me that makes you nervous,” Tommy says as Eddie “crashes” the date. “I’m not lying about who I am,” Buck said earlier in the date. Buck, instead, however, gets even more nervous with Eddie there. Did Tommy assume that Buck was simply not ready to come out to Eddie leaving him feeling like he was pulled back into the closet as well, or did he feel the tension that led him to assume that Buck didn’t want Eddie to know he was on a date for other reasons?

We can assume the thought of Buddie was already in Tommy’s mind. This was likely another strike that first formed his mentality that Buck may eventually leave him for “the competition”. And so, he decides to leave before he gets his heart broken, telling Buck that while he likes him, he doesn’t think Buck is ready. Ready for a relationship or ready to admit his true feelings? That’s a question I want to pose after Thursday’s episode.

That leads us to the coffee date. Tommy states that he cut the first date short because he didn’t want to pressure Buck. Buck gives a pretty heartfelt speech about not knowing what he’s ready for, but being ready for something and wanting that with Tommy. Tommy starts to respond, “you already know that I’m interested,” but gets cut off with Buck inviting Tommy as his date to Madney’s wedding. Tommy agrees, but that reluctance is still there. This is admittedly a big step, so his reluctance can definitely point to simple nerves over the gesture. We’re still in the early stages, but I suppose this could definitely be read as Tommy still having those suspicions about Buck’s feelings for Eddie in the back of his mind. Tommy is interested in Buck, but he isn’t quite sure if Buck reciprocates that interest or if it’s all projection (this ties into the beginning of my theory of Tommy thinking that Buck would eventually leave him for Eddie being the reason that Tommy seems to put so little effort into his relationship with Buck, but I said I’d leave my personal bias out of this analysis, so I’ll leave that for another time or possibly the comments). 

**7x06: There Goes the Groom**

The Buck and Eddie dynamic made a very famous appearance in this episode’s bachelor party sequence. Tommy, of course, shows up to the party with Eddie already present and in an intricate matching outfit with Buck that Tommy was not invited to join. While Tommy has been told all about the Buck and Eddie dynamic and their important roles in each other’s lives, Tommy is now beginning to fully witness their closeness that goes beyond Buck potentially having one sided feelings. 

Also, depending on who you ask, some will say Tommy got a little witness of jealous Eddie in that scene as well, though my personal thoughts about jealous Eddie are better showcased through a BuckTaylor analysis than a BuckTommy one, but once again, that’s for another day.

One last point I want to make is that this marks the third time that Buck, Eddie, and Tommy were framed in the aforementioned love triangle format, completing the three images with Eddie in the middle this time.

Honestly, I don’t think there’s much to say in regards to the hospital wedding kiss and scene, but I feel it was worth quickly mentioning since it was a pretty prevalent BuckTommy moment.

**7x09: Ashes, Ashes**

The medal ceremony. In this scene, after each name of a character is called, we are shown the reaction of their love interest immediately after. Hen shows us Karen, Chimney shows us Maddie, Tommy shows us Buck, and Buck shows us…Eddie? And of course, Eddie shows us Marisol. 

“Enjoy it while it lasts,” Tommy says to Buck about the attention for the cruise ship save. I’ve seen some people say that this could be a little nod that Tommy is enjoying his relationship with Buck while he still has it, or before Tommy thinks Buck will leave him for Eddie.

One more thing to note about this episode is that through Buck’s conversation with Bobby, we know he was going to see Tommy before running into Kim. This led to Buck cancelling his plans with Tommy and rushing over to Eddie’s, which he likely told Tommy he was doing. As is evident, a lot of signs of the Buckley-Diaz dynamic were starting to become obvious, but I imagine this was likely strike two for Tommy. 

**7x10: All Fall Down**

The infamous daddy issues scene. I don’t have much to comment on that part of the scene, and frankly I probably shouldn’t in this post, but I do want to talk about Tommy’s jealousy over the team dynamic. Tommy feels excluded from a family that has already built itself; one he knows he likely can’t force his way into. Who’s in that family? Eddie. This scene can definitely play into the idea that Tommy knows he’ll never be able to replace the role Eddie has in Buck’s life no matter how much he says he wants to be that person.

**8x01: Buzzkill**

Tommy is invited to Chris’ over facetime birthday party at Eddie’s house. Whether Buck or Eddie invited him, though, we may honestly never know (though, adding quick personal input, I do think it was most likely Buck). What was important, though, is the fact that *Buck* was invited. Buck is considered an essential part of Eddie and his son’s lives for him to be present in what was always likely going to be an extremely hard and emotional moment for Eddie.

Tommy isn’t blind. He can see that this implies an essential role that Buck has not only in Eddie’s life, but in the life of Eddie’s own kid. Buck is not only Eddie’s best friend, but also Eddie’s emotional support; the only one the normally very reserved Eddie Diaz lets see at his lowest moments. Tommy can see how important that is and how that will never change between them no matter what either’s relationship status is. They will always be number one for the other.

Also, here comes our last love triangle framing, with Eddie once again in the middle. This marks the second time he is posed in between the couple, and he is the only one to be posed in the middle twice, likely showing his role as the unknowing obstacle between Buck and Tommy.

**8x05: Masks**

Here’s the kicker episode. Everything already started tumbling, but here’s where we’re really going downhill. Strike three, if I dare to say.

As Tommy shows up to Buck’s hospital room, Eddie is already there, comfortably sitting next to Buck, keeping him company. To Tommy, it seems like everytime he shows up to something, Eddie is already there taking the place that he, as Buck’s partner, should seemingly be occupying.

Tommy had to be reminded who Athena was *by Eddie*, reiterating my point that Eddie is part of the family that Buck already built for himself, and it is next to impossible for Tommy to infiltrate the “partner” space that Eddie already occupies.

I want to emphasize that this problem has always existed. It’s a large part of why none of Buck and Eddie’s previous relationships worked out. Tommy, however, has the advantage for a couple reasons: he knows many of the people already in this family prior to the family forming, he was briefly friends with Eddie first meaning he also got Eddie’s perspective on Buck’s role in his life, and he knows that Buck is definitely interested in men, and therefore may be interested in Eddie. Like I said, I think Taylor was close enough to Buck and has seen enough of Eddie (especially jealous Eddie) to suspect (especially since she was there during the shooting *and* Eddie’s breakdown arc and likely saw just how much time and effort Buck was putting into helping Eddie during those times) that something was up, and I think if we ever do see her again, we are at a point in the writing and with the network that she would call out that relationship, but all she could do is suspect. Tommy *knows* that Buck is bisexual. Now obviously, him being bisexual does not automatically mean that he will have feelings for his best friend, but it just means that Tommy knows that the potential is there. This potential is simply proven to him because of how Buck and Eddie mutually act with one another.

They have plenty of medically trained friends, some likely more than Eddie, but they (probably Buck) call Eddie to take a look at Buck’s boils. Eddie will always be Buck’s first to contact, even before a current partner. The trust Buck has in Eddie becomes more and more evident to Tommy every day. While this one interaction alone wouldn’t be a big deal, piled with everything Tommy felt from the very beginning and yesterday’s hospital fiasco? The unbreakable dynamic becomes more and more obvious each day.

The next hospital scene had the 118 waiting for news about Denny’s surgery. Everyone gets the text about the surgery going well except for Tommy. The writers made a point of including everyone looking relieved at their phones while Tommy looks around in confusion. They emphasized Tommy feeling excluded once again from the family that’s already been built. The family that other love interests, mainly Taylor, have mentioned not being able to fit into as well. The family that includes Eddie.

Once again, I don’t really have much to say about the graveyard scene. I do think that the graveyard scene is an interesting parallel with the distance between Buck and Tommy compared to how close Buck and Eddie were in their own scene in season 6, but as for Tommy’s feelings which is what we’re addressing here, similarly to the hospital kiss, I don’t have too much to add to this scene.

**8x06: Confessions**

And finally the break up episode. Buck and Tommy are on their anniversary date and Tommy gives Buck basketball tickets. With this interesting choice of a gift, Tommy tells Buck that he doesn’t have to take him, and he could even take Eddie if he wants. Buck gives a little “really?” to which Tommy responds, “and die”. Here, Tommy was the one to bring up Eddie first, likely in a jealous slip. It seems that part of Tommy wonders if Buck would choose to take Eddie over Tommy if given the choice. Tommy seems to be at the point in the relationship where he has fully acknowledged the role that Eddie has in Buck’s life; he’s almost fully accepted the fact that he now thinks Eddie will be Buck’s *last*, as will be discussed in a bit. Tommy had absolutely no reason to bring up Eddie here unless it was a moment of testing the waters or testing if his thoughts about the nature of the Buddie dynamic are correct. This all gets derailed by the Abby revelation which of course completely throws Buck for a loop, but for the purpose of this conversation, this is irrelevant, at least for now.

Buck eventually confronts Tommy with his revelation which leads to the breakup that confused many people. I know many people expressed confusion as to how this one revelation led to the break up, but really, this revelation simply was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Let’s just say, Buck definitely took Josh’s speech to heart and a lot of what he said only proved that he saw Tommy on a very surface level, or at least definitely not enough to move in together. 

>Tommy: “Because…I know how this ends.”

>Buck: “Uh, w-what’s that supposed to mean?”

>Tommy: “Look, Evan…you’re an incredible guy. Big hearted, hot as hell, funny, impulsive, but what you’re feeling right now is-is new, and it’s exciting, and it feels like forever, but you’re still figuring yourself out, and that’s *good.*”

>Buck: “What are you saying?”

>Tommy: “I’m saying, no matter how bad I wanted to be, I’m not your last, I’m your first.”

>Buck: “Hey, they can be the same thing.”

>Tommy: “But they usually aren’t. If I were to move in with you, you wouldn’t mean to, you wouldn’t plan for it, but you’d end up breaking *my* heart. And I don’t think that I could deal with that.”

It was never about Abby; Tommy was always talking about Eddie. As was proven in the 8x11 kitchen scene (it’s always Eddie’s kitchen, guys), when Tommy said Buck is still figuring himself out and would unintentionally be breaking his heart, he always meant that Buck would eventually figure out his feelings for Eddie and subsequently leave him for Eddie. Tommy knows that Eddie will always be Buck’s number one. He already fills that partner role informally, so if given the realization and opportunity, why would Buck not take Eddie in that role formally as well? Especially assuming that Tommy thinks Eddie isn’t straight either, he *feels* that those feelings are mutual, and that he therefore does not stand a chance. The Abby revelation and Buck’s speech were only catalysts to the breakup, *Eddie was the cause*.

In the broader scheme of things, all of this *does* come full circle, as much as the choice was likely a last minute one by Tim. Eddie and Buck are at a point where they are *heavily* paralleling Buck and Abby. And honestly, having Abby and Eddie be the two reasons Tommy broke up with Buck and then following that with the Eddie and Abby parallels is quite the foreshadowing, whether intentional or not.

**8x11: Holy Mother of God**

And finally we’re here. Not much to say analysis wise as Tommy’s words finally speak for themselves; they are the words being used to analyze these scenes in the first place. Tommy says that Eddie was his competition, and now that Eddie is finally out of the way, he feels comfortable pursuing Buck again. Like I said, this just proves that it was always about Eddie. His fear of eventual heartbreak completely evaporated when Eddie wasn’t constantly mere feet away from them. Their whole relationship developed with Eddie constantly unknowingly haunting it, all while he and Buck are oblivious to the whole thing.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I have so much more to say, to be honest, in regards to how long Maddie has known as well as a lot of other word choices used by Buck throughout the BuckTommy relationship, but this post is already getting long enough and was specifically made to discuss the Tommy revelation, so I decided to focus on scenes that include Tommy for now. 

And let me just add my own thoughts here at the end, rewatching all these scenes with this perspective in mind just leaves me even more shocked at how Tommy was really just ready to get back together the moment Eddie was out of the way. Eddie was *always* the problem, the root of *all* of Tommy’s hesitancy. 

A few days ago, I also mentioned how the whole *Evan* thing might have stemmed from Eddie too. Tommy wanted something in Buck’s life that Eddie didn’t already occupy, so he did that by calling Buck by the name that Eddie would never dare to use in any average context. This of course did not work in the long run as the name 'Buck' means much more in a positive context to Buck than the name 'Evan', but it was still Tommy’s attempt to have something that Eddie didn’t already fill.

Looking back, it doesn’t make Tommy look any better, but it puts so much of what confused me about their relationship into perspective. Those jealous feelings Tommy had about the 118 family dynamic that were never properly addressed?

Back in November I matched with a guy on Hinge, we chatted for a bit and then fell out of contact. About a month / month and a half ago, we actually made contact again and things have been going really well

We've gone on a bunch of dates, to coffee places, on walks, to watch a film in the cinema, and recently I went out clubbing with a couple of his friends. I've stayed the night at his a couple of times (just casually, nothing happened), and last night we had our first kiss. 

He makes me very happy, but I also just have this constant sinking in my stomach. We're 19 (me) and 20 (him) respectively, both uni students. He's the 5th guy I've ever been on a date with and is the furthest along I've ever gotten in a relationship. I know since we're so young, relationships are fickle and may not last. But I keep letting that fact get to me - I constantly worry that the more time I spend with him the more attached I'll be and the more it'll hurt if we break up.
     I love the time we spend together, but when we're not together I'm wondering how he feels towards me, how I could be doing more to see him or how maybe his friends don't like me very much. 

He's given me so much reassurance, saying he really likes me, that I'm cute and funny and attractive, but it feels like sometimes it goes in one ear and out the other as soon as we've parted. I've opened up to him a bit about my mental health but not much, and I don't know if now is the time to do that or how I would / if I should go about explaining these feelings to him without jeopardising what we have. 

Anyways, I hope someone has some useful advice. If not, that's okay, I hope you all have a wonderful day. Thank you for taking the time to read this :))",1,1742745770.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

I didn't do AA, I didn't have a support system, I just came here and posted, and read, read books, and figured it out. Every day has been a gift, and I swear I feel joy every time I think of how I finally stopped doing something I had worried about for years.

Yesterday, in a session with a client, he started talking about his life, which indicated he was many years sober. I started asking him questions, and pretty soon we were in the most fun conversation about the journey of quitting drinking. The lies we tell ourselves before we quit. The crazy justifications, the physical stuff we try to write off to something else (me: Two weeks on a cruise with unlimited alcohol, and chalking up feeling like shit to ""the coffee.""). We were laughing our asses off and just loving a great conversation together. This guy has 40-some years of sobriety and was probably looking at me like I'm a baby just learning to walk, but man, it felt good to have that gentle, understanding support.

It was wonderful. It felt like coming out into the sunshine to have someone to share with. This is my regret at not joining AA or another in-person support group. I felt like I needed that conversation like I need oxygen. Like, finally--someone totally gets it. Someone I can share with who won't recoil in horror that I (a) might be judging them or (b) act like my still-drinking husband, who will change the subject in a panic if I mention being proud of being done. My former drinking buddies have pretty much disappeared--not that I care, really--my favorite thing is being home with a nice cup of tea and a good book--but all that to say--sometimes ya just need to talk to people who get it. I don't think I knew that until the other day.

Thank you to everyone here--you've been my people. I really, really appreciate you!

I have started with Nespresso (4 machines, I was even an Ambassador); then moved to a super automatic Gaggia that died and then to BBE. BBE served me for four years and finally I decided to buy a Eureka Libra two months ago. 

Then I found a used Profitec Go but underestimated the fact that it’s not dual boiler. 

After weeks watching tons of video of the Micra now I’m planning to get a Decent (a little afraid of this being overwhelming).

I don't trust in any of the teachings or follow along with the WOW for sure don't feel God will spite me due to coffee or drinking a beer. Along with all the HX of the founding of the church and Joseph Smith and the dramas there. Anyways, my wife still believes and attends the church along with my 2 young children (5&3).

My wife and I did get sealed, I was endowed, and held the Melchizedek Priesthood. 

My questions is if I submit my request to remove my name from records, how will that effect my wife and children within the church? Will this keep her from certain things since I'm not connected anymore. Even though I no longer believe, she does so I don't wanna mess anything up for her..

I'm AfroLatina and my boyfriend (M18) is Irish-American. I've always been fairly fashion conscious and aware of flattering colors, shapes, patterns for my body type and skin tone while my boyfriend is a bit of an Adam Sandler.

It's our senior year and despite us both not being the ""party type"" he's decided that he would really like to go to prom. I'm cool with that! It'll be our last time hanging out with peers and an opportunity for us to look and feel our best as a couple

The problem? I feel like it's my responsibility to make us look good.... And I haven't a goddamn clue how. 

I have type 3c black/brown hair with warm brown eyes and a caramel/coffee w/ cream skin tone depending on how much time I spend in the sun. He has pale brown-ish ginger hair and hazel-green eyes with pale skin and very prominent red undertones. We're like night and day appearance-wise and I'm struggling especially with what colors we should wear

He says he doesn't care much, but I know he's self-conscious about his appearance being a plus-sized guy with some remainders of his teenage acne. Even though both of our favorite colors are red and black, I don't want to choose a warm color and have him feel tomatoe-y. 

On the opposite end, I don't always look great in cool colors, I've found that especially shades of green and teal make my skin look blotchy and red, exactly the thing I want to avoid for him.

So, I figured I'd come on here and look for opinions!

Colors I've thought about so far are Purple, Royal Blue, Grey/silver, a darker/cooler maroon or burgundy. My biggest worry is choosing a color that makes us both look unkempt or tacky

Over the past few years, I've gone through three units: two Magnifica S Smart models and, most recently, a Magnifica Evo. All of them stopped frothing milk properly after about a year and a half of use.

Now, I understand milk proteins can sometimes be tricky for these machines, and I’ve dealt with them. But this goes beyond that—it's as if these machines hit a specific usage threshold and just refuse to froth milk altogether. I only make about two coffees a day, so the cup count isn't that high. I also clean it thoroughly pretty often taking apart the the milk unit and soaking the brew unit.

All three machines were purchased from Costco, which makes me wonder if they're cutting corners on parts for Costco units. Anyone else had a similar experience with these machines from Costco? That said, I appreciate Costco's return policy—as i just go in and return then get a new unit. But I'm now at the point where I’m questioning whether these units with milk frothing are even worth it. Costco canada doesnt seem to be selling these De'Longhi  units anymore so my return and replace seems to have come to an end.

I’m seriously considering switching back to a semi-automatic machine. Sure, they require more work, but at least they don’t seem to give out so quickly.

Has anyone else run into this issue with De'Longhi super automatic machines? Any advice or insight? Maybe I’m missing something that could extend their life.

I am an avid watcher of this channel and have learned a lot through listening to Charlotte. I wanted to make this post as I feel this is a very supportive and loving subreddit and I could use the advice. Names have been changed for privacy.

I (24F) live with my roommate/friend, Bethany (22F), and things have been tense for a while and I am at my wit's end. Here is some important context: We have lived together for almost 2 years, we met the last year of college and moved in together that following summer. I’m autistic and have ADHD, so conflict is especially hard for me. I struggle to express myself in the moment and often shut down when confronted. I also tend to let things go just to keep the peace, even when I’m hurt. I feel like I’m always the one initiating conversations, making plans, and fixing conflicts. If I don’t reach out, we just don’t talk.

One of the biggest conflicts between us is my dog, Oakley. He’s a 15-month-old Goldendoodle and my first dog. I love him so much, he is my soul dog and saved my life, without him I can’t say I would be here today. Brittney has a 4-year-old Shih Tzu named Pebbles, and while I get that having two dogs in an apartment isn’t always easy, I feel like she treats Oakley unfairly.

A while back, we had a sit-down conversation because things were tense, and she admitted she was mad that I got a dog so soon after she got Pebbles. I don’t completely understand why but I tried to ease her concerns. She *knew* I had been looking for a dog for a long time—even before we moved in together—and I had originally planned to get one before she got hers. I get that having a puppy around can be difficult, and Oakley is in no way her responsibility, but I can’t shake the feeling that she’s still holding a grudge against him. And that’s not fair.

Some examples of how she treats him unfairly:

* When Oakley was young we had problems with him chewing up her stuff that she would leave out ou unattended. Once when Oakley was 6 months old, he chewed up her bath mat. Instead of having a conversation about it, she immediately yelled, “Who is going to pay for this?” and, “I shouldn’t have to replace things when he keeps destroying them.” I understood her frustration, and I took responsibility for it and paid for the mat, but it rubbed me the wrong way. She would also leave things like her underwear out, and when Oakley got into them, she blamed me even though I would expressly tell her that despite my efforts to keep him from getting her stuff, she needed to pick up after herself and keep her door closed.
* She constantly calls Oakley “annoying” for every little thing. One day last week, he had an accident in his crate (I work full time, this has not happened in at least 6 months). She let him out to take him outside, and when he put his paw on her, she got mad and said, “He’s being so annoying.” I asked, “Do you mean because his paw was wet?” she said, “No, he shouldn’t be jumping.” But *her* dog also jumps, and I’ve never reacted like that.
* The other night, Oakley accidentally knocked over her plant and she lost it. He got the Zoomies while playing tug, jumped onto a footstool, and it tipped over which knocked over one of her plants. She came out and yelled, “You have GOT to be kidding me.” I immediately apologized, repotted the plant, and cleaned the apartment. She did not say anything else to me, and just silently took it into her room and went to bed. Accidents happen, and I just wish she wouldn’t be so harsh.
* Her dog has also damaged my things, but I don’t react the way she does. Pebbles has chewed up my expensive handmade coffee table, always rubs his dirty face all over my furniture, and will even nip and jump at me when he’s excited. I don’t like it, but I accept that he’s a dog and don’t make a big deal out of it.

Beyond the dog-related issues, she also treats me unfairly in other ways.

* Two months ago I had a cold, and she barely spoke to me. When I finally asked if she was okay, she snapped, “I leave for Puerto Rico next week, I don’t need to get sick.” Her tone was aggressive like I was deliberately trying to get her sick. I told her, “I’m not contagious,” since I had tested negative for COVID and was spraying Lysol religiously around the apartment. She still doubted me and asked, “Are you sure?” The part that got me is that just the week before, *she* had the flu and didn’t care at all if she got me sick, and would cough and sneeze everywhere around me. I don’t get sick days at work, but she does. And yet, when *she* was sick, I checked in on her and asked how she was feeling. She didn’t do the same for me.
* Also, there are multiple instances where I’ve been extremely upset, crying, and hoping Bethany would step in and offer support, but instead, she completely ignores me. I’m currently struggling with depression and have been in an episode, and both times I’ve been in tears, I hoped she would at least ask if I was okay or offer some comfort. The most recent time, I was sobbing on the phone with my mom, coming in from taking Oakley outside. Bethany walked right past me, not even bothering to ask if I was okay. This hurt, especially since I’ve been so supportive of her during her recent breakup. I spent the entire evening consoling her and even went out of my way to buy her candy because I thought it would make her feel better. I don’t do these things expecting anything in return, but when I’m upset, I’d like the same courtesy extended to me. To be ignored when I’m clearly in distress feels incredibly isolating, and it’s hard not to feel like I don’t matter at all to her.

Another thing that gets to me is that whenever she’s upset with me, she completely shuts down and gives me silent treatment instead of talking about what’s wrong. This puts me in a tough position because I struggle with picking up social cues, so I’m often left second-guessing what I did wrong or if I even did anything wrong at all. When I eventually break the silence and ask what’s going on, it always feels like I’m the one chasing after her to fix things, even when she’s the hurtful one. It’s exhausting, and I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells, trying to avoid upsetting her, even though I shouldn’t have to. I also have a habit of forgiving people easily, even when they’ve hurt me, so I end up sweeping things under the rug just to keep the peace. But lately, it’s been weighing on me, and I don’t think I can keep doing that.

I vented to my sister about everything, and she pointed out something I hadn’t considered: something *is* probably going on with Bethany that she isn’t talking about. Maybe it’s her breakup, her mom, work, or something else. She has a right to her feelings, but she *doesn’t* have the right to take it out on me, Oakley, or even Pebbles. At the same time, my sister also said that this has happened so many times that she wouldn’t blame me for taking it personally. She told me that Bethany is being unfair, and she doesn’t understand why she’s so rude to Oakley when Pebbles has done some similar (if not worse) things and I’ve been nothing but patient. She also reminded me not to let Bethany’s comments about Oakley get to me because he has completely turned my life around.

I think what hurts the most is that I feel like I’m *always* the one who has to keep the peace. I’m constantly trying to make sure I don’t upset her, and honestly, I feel like I’m walking on eggshells in my own home. It makes me feel like I’m always in the wrong, even though I know I’m not. That’s not how a friendship or roommate dynamic should feel.

This brings me to my question: Normally, when we have an issue, I *always* break the silence first. This time, I’ve been waiting to see if she’ll say something, and it’s been almost a week of us not talking except for the occasional polite conversation. I *know* I need to address things with her, but verbal confrontation is really difficult for me. I feel like if I try to talk to her in person, I’ll either shut down or she’ll dismiss me. I communicate much better in writing, so I’m considering writing her a letter instead of trying to talk face-to-face. I worry she’ll see it as passive-aggressive or immature, but I also don’t feel like I’ll be able to get my point across otherwise.

1ji27o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1ji27o4/adulting_according_to_an_adult_barely/,Adulting According to an Adult (barely),"I love and hate Adulting.

It is an informal term that refers to the actions and behaviors considered typical of adults, often emphasizing the mundane and sometimes challenging tasks of independent living and responsibility.

It is a fun word because it serves as a noun and a verb and it is used when becoming, being or behaving like an adult, specifically when referring to the practical aspects of being an adult.

You pay your bills (hopefully on time). You clean your house (if you adulted successfully). You manage your finances (by putting that $5 into your savings instead of buying another coffee, only to take that $5 out next week to buy another coffee). You make and keep appointments (if you don't, your knee is going to fall off by the time your 40). You do whatever other responsibilities there are.

It was coined by millennials to talk about the challenges of navigating all these things in a humorous way.

But I think it is important to remember that Adulting is just a concept; the concept that many of us are unprepared to deal with the overwhelmingly complex process of pretending to be an adult.

And that's okay.

Because among all these mundane, meaningless things, Adulting also allows us to write books. Or read an article about the next asteroid that is supposed to hit the planet. Or appear in a TV show. Adulting is inevitable, regardless of your past experiences or culture.

Speaking of TV shows, there is a South African drama called Adulting that came out in 2023 on Showmax and 1Magic.

There is also a podcast called Adulting by Oenone that talks about all the different aspects of Adulting.

A lot of people will read this and say, ""Congratulations or I'm sorry, I ain't reading all that."" Either way, thanks for letting me rant about my love/hate relationship with Adulting. Let me know what you all think of the show and/or podcast!!

1ji25mm,https://i.redd.it/y7zqkykhmgqe1.jpeg,Downgrade or side-grade [500euro],"Hi! First post :)

This is my setup, Isomac Millenium, Graef for decaf, RR45 for regular.

What started off as a hobby, progressing from cheap non branded espresso machine, to Gaggia Evolution to the E61 heat exchanger has now become just a means to make a good cup of coffee. No more measuring, dialling, experimenting etc Life getting in the way lol, children, house renovations, work, the usual. I am the only one that uses the machine

I bought this Isomac used for 500euro back in 2010 in Germany. The first service sticker inside the machine is from 2007. Over the years we have replaced various switches, lights, water hoses a circuit board, OPV, and probably more. This is what I love most about these machines, an investment sure but years and years of service. I think the pump is probably failing. I can hear the boiler refilling often while idling. I descaled recently and the return hose in the water tank is often flowing. The mushroom valve is leaking limescale at the top. My coffee now tastes very acidic, and is totally flat, no crema, pressure shows 1.7 bar constant, it has always been at that, although I have two new beans so that doesnt help. The casing has seen better days and the footprint of the machine is huge!!

I think it is time to move on. I would love something smaller, the whole area is generally cramped and messy.

I can't decide whether to downgrade to one of the solis/breville/sage machines. I love that they look so neat and tidy and with the built in grinder I would be able to get rid of one of mine so more room.

I am also wondering whether I would miss the constant pressure and steam if I downgraded so maybe side step to another E61 but try to find something smaller.

I have been out of the game for so long and don't know what brands are current and what new models are out there. What I am really worried about is buying something that I can't fix myself when the guaranty runs out.

Can someone throw some brands at me to look into please?

Would Rancilio Silvia fit the bill do you think? This was on my list last time. I have also seen a few smaller machines from Lelit which is a brand I have never heard of.

My budget for new or used will be around 500euro, thanks!",1,1742744625.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

We just purchased our first ball python Thursday afternoon, and he was in the late stages of the shedding cycle already when we got him. Sunday morning, I woke up and he was bonking around his habitat and I figured he was just being curious. Started some coffee, went out to smoke, and came back to find what looks like a fully shed skin (and also some poop)

He does not appear to have any remnants of skin on his body, as he was still moving around the enclosure at this time, so I was thinking that he's probably completely finished. We offered him a thawed out and warmed mouse-sicle yesterday, and he struck at it and played with it, but left it uneaten. It went in the trash.   He's currently balled up under his cool-side hide and chilling out. No more roaming around and rubbing against stuff

I was wondering if I should wait to offer him another to make sure he's completely done with his outfit change, or if it's safe to feed him now that he's gone back to his chill position under the log

Enter an old first date (let's call him Mr. 36) who suddenly reappeared after years of radio silence. We exchanged some conversation and when goals where brought up, I mentioned I wasn't interested in dating because of my busy schedule. In the context, it was not directed at him, but in general of why I'm still a lone wolf. I accepted his coffee invitation for an in person catch-up.

But I'm really on the fence. Mr. 36 didn't speak to me for years before this second date. I asked him about this and he felt he was an option and thought of me as a player. Which I'm not. Albeit, I could see his perspective of why he felt that way. In my defence, and I'm not making excuses for myself but simply to clarify with facts, it was my first time putting myself out there post-divorce. I took the stellar advice of my dear friends and family to ""just go in lightly"", ""screen the candidates"", ""go for coffee dates to get to know them"", and ""navigate from there"". I was open and honest to him that I had other first dates lined-up when he asked me. He went silent after that. I felt awful as I could tell by his body language at the time that he was disappointed by my response, and I too pulled back after that first date. For the record, I was only on the app for a week and deleted it as OLD just wasn't for me.

Fast forward back to our second date yesterday, I was delighted by the chemistry. We shared laughs, jokes, talked about family, career, politics, every topic was so easy. I found myself sipping on my latte and thinking ""wow, this guy is still the same nice, funny, ridiculous attractive human I remember"". But here's the problem, my heart is still wearing an emotional armour from the last time it was shattered...I'm genuinely interested but also immensely terrified.

I'd like advice on how to navigate this. Does anyone have stories or advice to share of how to not walk through a minefield blindfolded? Does one just channel their inner Shia LaBeouf and ""JUST DO IT!""? I could really use some perspective before I make a move. With a kid, it's not just about protecting my heart alone. 

Can we please make this a conversation about love, second chances, maybe share some disasters if they're funny, and if it's ""just stick to coffee dates"", I'll still appreciate that advice because at least that comes with free refills.

Single women are virtually nonexistent in Orthodoxy, and all of the younger married couples have young children. My husband has never had trouble finding men to connect with, as there’s always plenty of single men in the church and he has no trouble relating to the married men with kids. 

It usually works out that dads have full time jobs, so it’s easier to relate to them if you don’t have kids, as parenthood makes up less of their “identity” than women. Many women in the church seem to be SAHM whose lives revolve around caring for their children. Not saying that there’s anything wrong with this at all; I’m just saying I find it nearly impossible to connect with women at church when their lifestyle is so different from a woman with a full time job and no kids. Often the women are busy chasing their kids around during coffee hour and, understandably, have no/minimal time to socialize. When they do, they’re often sitting with other moms talking about their kids. 

It almost feels like I have no purpose in the church because I don’t have kids. Like women have no role in Orthodoxy outside of bearing children when being a SAHM. It’s really easy to feel invisible and like there’s no one for you to relate to. I guess this is just a vent idk. I usually end up sitting/ standing next to my husband while he talks with other men, feeling kind of awkward and left out. It doesn’t help that I’m not the most outgoing person to begin with. Lately I’ve been feeling a bit apathetic towards church, and I think this is a contributing factor. 

Before anyone asks, my husband and I are recently married and have a large age gap. We likely won’t be having children due to his age and the corresponding health risks that would come with trying to conceive with this kind of age gap.

can you recommend a setup with the these conditions:

* Free end of day market data (CBOT, CME, NYMEX, ICE)
* Tick data
* Volume profile (composite)  

I thought about NinjaTrader or Sierra Chart.  

Is it still possible to get free end of day data with NinjaTrader? With Kinetick or Continuum? Because I downloaded NinjaTrader and chose *Simulation*, but the only connections available are *Playback* and *Simulation*. With *Simulation* there are just a handful of Futures, but commodities like Coffee or Cotton aren't even displayed. Do I have to register for Live Trading instead of Simulation to see other Connections? I've heard that in 2024 all market data for ICE disappeard. That would be a no-go for me.  

If I'm correctly informed, with Sierra Chart I'd need Service Package 3 for 26 USD/month to get the Volume Profile I need, which would be fine. But on top I'd need data feed subscriptions, because they don't have free end of day market data, if I'm right and that's pricey.  

I only want to use volume profile on daily candles and the volume profile must use tick data. I just need a charting tool for analysis, without real time data, intraday data, market depth etc. Currently I'm only subscriped to TradingView, but they don't have tick data for non-professionals, so their volume profile doesn't fit my purpose.  

I would really appreciate your help in finding the best/cheapest setup for me.

THIS CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING A Lalaloopsy resorting to murder when she was driven to insanity due to lack of sleep

sorry if this makes little to no sense

Hello. y'know about the animated adaption of the toy brand Lalaloopsy, right? honestly I'm a pretty big fan and have a pretty big collection! i still am but after watching that video, i can't really look at a specific Lalaloopsy girl the same as much as i used to. that's the case for Pillow Featherbed; yes, the sleepyhead of the main 8, + my favorite. here's why: So a couple days ago, I was browsing MP4 files (don't ask) and found a file containing an unknown episode. out of curiosity, i clicked on it; thinking not much would happen.

The Lalaloopsy intro played and it was pretty much the same as any other episode, but pretty poor quality. The title card had a counter consisting of a lamp sitting next to a thing of Sweet Dreams Melatonin with the words ""Stay Awake Syndrome"" written on the lamp.

The episode began with Pillow getting ready to go to bed; yawning. ""Well i would be lying if this weren't my favorite time of the day.. sleeping the night away. am I right, sheep?"" she sighed. Sheep let out a baa; and Pillow turned off the lights, ready to sleep. as she was sleeping, she suddenly stopped. ""what..? suddenly I can't sleep.. again."" she mumbled, then turning to see some melatonin gummies on her counter, thinking those could help. Spoiler: they didn't. Pillow then says to herself ""what's happening? is there something wrong with me? i just wanna sleep.."",

the scene then zooms out to Pillow's house. cut to the very next scene in the morning, with an exhausted Pillow at Crumbs Sugar Cookie's house, who's offering her some tea and cookies to help boost her mood. ""So what's with the long face, Featherbed?"" Crumbs asked out of worry; ""Well.. i just.. couldn't... sleep.. for the.. whole.. night.. yeah.. but.. i think... it was hopefully.. only.. for that... night."" Pillow slurred, with a very weary expression. ""But thanks.. for the tea, though.."" she thanked Crumbs and left, still a bit tired. Later that day, Pillow decided to stay at Bea Spells a Lot's house, telling her what happened; with Bea saying she should take a book to help her sleep a bit easier. ""Y'know Pillow, maybe you should try counting sheep again, or even thinking of something super boring. that sort of worked for me when i couldn't sleep, so it should for you too!"".

Later that night, Pillow told herself, ""Well, hope this works.."" she read a few pages of the unnamed book but still could not sleep. she suffered from another whole night of being unable to rest. The very next day, she had her come to Rosy Bumps n' Bruises' hospital to ask the nurse what's going on with her, but twice as exhausted as yesterday. At first, Rosy just says she has minor sleeping issues, but after telling her some more things about her situation, Rosy diagnosed her with ""Stay Awake Syndrome,"" a disease with no known cure. Pillow, for some reason, walks out of Rosy's hospital after her diagnosis and into Pickles B.L.T's diner with little to no explanation as to why. She then says that she needs about 8 coffees, but after getting them, she dumps them all over herself, now with a twitchy eye or button. that's when things started to get pretty concerning. ""..Sugar, why'd ya do that?"" Pickles asked out of confusion. Pillow didn't explain and just ran. it just panned up to the sky.

the next shot showed the night sky and panned into Pillow's house. Pillow, sitting in the left corner of her house, in a fetal position, was rocking back and forth while mumbling ""i need rest.. i need rest.."". this went on for a full minute and a half. Sheep then brought a clock and began leaping over it, hoping it would at least do something. that also did nothing. we then get a montage of her consuming melatonin, reading the book Bea gave to her, and counting sheep; even hallucinating a tall, red figure with a rather creepy expression. I was creeped out a bit, so i paused it and went to grab a glass of water mixed with kool aid. I went back and watched the rest.

We then get a shot to the other 7 main Lalaloopsies discussing that Pillow hasn't been heard from for 8 whole days at Dot's house. Jewel declared ""Then we shall investigate whatever's going on with her!"". the 7 go to Pillow's house, covered in melatonin containers and scratches. Pillow was huddled in the corner, then she suddenly twisted her neck 180 degrees, to face the others. I noticed Pillow started to gain bloodshot sclera, her neck began to randomly twitch, her hair was messier than usual, and she suddenly had very sharp teeth. for some odd reason she now had a knife, in which she used to slice Peanut Big Top's throat open and gouge out her left eye. she chased after the others with a knife, managing to slaughter Jewel and Spot Splatter Splash, with one getting beheaded and the other getting her eyes gouged out. ""OH MY GOSH!"" Dot Starlight exclaimed just before getting her face completely torn off by.. you know who at this point. the depraved doll then tackled down Mittens Fluff n Stuff, managing to gouge out her eye, but suddenly fell into cardiac arrest, likely due to the melatonin, giving Mittens the chance to stab her multiple times in the head, and that's where the episode ends. I have to say i was rather creeped out by that episode even though it was all just fiction, but since it had a pretty graphic ending, I just shut my laptop and never spoke of that again. i got my Pillow Featherbed doll and placed her on a different shelf from where i usually store my Lalaloopsy dolls, just out of pure concern.

Im newish to this sub reddit.

My partner late 20s. She told me early on she had BPD and I have a strong remembering of it.

Later on she told me she doesn't have it and doesn't believe in the DSM. For BPD that is. She claims it's not widely enough understood for people to be diagnosed with BPD.

I've done a ton of reading into BPD. Also read into OCD on numerous occasions.

I've begun to understand. My ex also had BPD and she cheated multiple times and eventually started dating one of her new supplies. 

My current partner has been going through extensive therapy and I've noticed some changes. There are some things that aren't getting better.


Recently I was in my office and watching some YouTube videos at the end of a night falling asleep. 

She came in crying upset about being lonely and having limited friends. I genuinely try my best to comfort her. She asks to be rubbed so I go to the couch and rub her. I'm trying to let her get it out because if I talk too much or give advice then I am smothering and not allowing space to vent. If I don't say anything and allow that then I lack empathy. When I try to meet a middle ground and tell her she can make friends and how it's hard as an adult. 

I ask why this is hitting her so hard right now if anything triggered her.

In a switch after the tears ended it turned into hostility towards me. 


""My boyfriend should say x, y z. "" 

I tried telling her I do love her and I did apologize that my way of comforting wasn't enough, and I also apologized for saying the wrong things to her. Which I don't feel like I did, and I don't feel like I should apologize for not saying the right things?
 
If you want me to say different in the future I'm open and I'd love to hear it. But the way it's proposed like there was an error in my ways to the point I was intentionally not giving her enough love, so I was in fact lacking empathy.

I expressed to her it doesn't feel like I can ever say the right things and the whole fight exploded from there.

She got upset and followed me into the other room. It wasn't rational or a coherent conversation after. Constant cutting off in the middle of speaking to try and prove me wrong. The yelling, and not leaving me alone even when she walked away and the door was closed she came back. Opened the door. And began crying loudly.

I ""made her feel bad"" when she was trying to express her emotions. So now I'm the bad guy and she's going to go into the city alone at a restaurant. 

My emotions don't matter and the effort I put forth is  disregarded at a moments notice. I am being discarded by the person who supposedly loves me and I don't feel like I have anywhere to turn.


I tried this morning to open conversation by getting her a coffee and bringing it home to her after the gym. 

I tried talking to her and her response was ""i can't work on resolving things when you just make me feel the way you do""

I am honestly hurt and dumbfounded because I try my best. I didn't raise my voice or cuss. I dont call anyone names. But I am painted as a villian. Bad guy, manipulator. I am called names even when I'm on vacation 3k miles away.

I'd like some genuine advice because I do love her but I am hurt


There's more to it. We've been dating for over a year. She's faked STDs, gone through my belongings, phone, she read my diary without consent. 

She accused me of talking to my ex numerous times. Has threatened to hit me  when I yelled back in response to her yelling at me when I was asleep.

She's shown up at my work / buisness in an attempt to see what I'm up to. 

Recently we had a funeral for my aunt and she complained about the day being long, boring, and she was tired. 

I can't wrap my head around treating my partner the way she does",1,1742743688.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

We're normally accustomed to seeing red coffee; there's also yellow coffee, and even pink and purple. I want to talk about the first three, which are the ones I'm familiar with, because I've never worked with varieties that produce a purple cherry color. When we look at the Brix of pink cherries, the Brix of yellow cherries, and the Brix of red cherries, all measured at their peak ripeness, we can see that pink cherries have a higher Brix level. The interesting thing here is that Brix, which are measured with a refractometer, typically show us the sugars or the amount of water-soluble solids. This, when we translate this to the cup, allows us to see that pink varieties tend to be a little sweeter and fruitier than yellow varieties, and yellow varieties sweeter than red varieties.  This is not a general rule, since it varies greatly depending on the conditions, climate, altitude, planting location, variety, genetics, but if this difference is seen when we do field experiments with a refractometer, it does not mean that the pink varieties are better, but it is an interesting factor to take into account since under equal conditions and with varieties that have the 3 types of cherry colors, the pink ones show a higher brix, which can be the precursors of more complex flavors, but in the end it is always a matter of preferences.",3,1742743518.0,pourover,0,0.8,False

Im newish to this sub reddit.

My partner late 20s. She told me early on she had BPD and I have a strong remembering of it.

Later on she told me she doesn't have it and doesn't believe in the DSM. For BPD that is. She claims it's not widely enough understood for people to be diagnosed with BPD.

I've done a ton of reading into BPD. Also read into OCD on numerous occasions.

I've begun to understand. My ex also had BPD and she cheated multiple times and eventually started dating one of her new supplies. 

My current partner has been going through extensive therapy and I've noticed some changes. There are some things that aren't getting better.


Recently I was in my office and watching some YouTube videos at the end of a night falling asleep. 

She came in crying upset about being lonely and having limited friends. I genuinely try my best to comfort her. She asks to be rubbed so I go to the couch and rub her. I'm trying to let her get it out because if I talk too much or give advice then I am smothering and not allowing space to vent. If I don't say anything and allow that then I lack empathy. When I try to meet a middle ground and tell her she can make friends and how it's hard as an adult. 

I ask why this is hitting her so hard right now if anything triggered her.

In a switch after the tears ended it turned into hostility towards me. 


""My boyfriend should say x, y z. "" 

I tried telling her I do love her and I did apologize that my way of comforting wasn't enough, and I also apologized for saying the wrong things to her. Which I don't feel like I did, and I don't feel like I should apologize for not saying the right things?
 
If you want me to say different in the future I'm open and I'd love to hear it. But the way it's proposed like there was an error in my ways to the point I was intentionally not giving her enough love, so I was in fact lacking empathy.

I expressed to her it doesn't feel like I can ever say the right things and the whole fight exploded from there.

She got upset and followed me into the other room. It wasn't rational or a coherent conversation after. Constant cutting off in the middle of speaking to try and prove me wrong. The yelling, and not leaving me alone even when she walked away and the door was closed she came back. Opened the door. And began crying loudly.

I ""made her feel bad"" when she was trying to express her emotions. So now I'm the bad guy and she's going to go into the city alone at a restaurant. 

My emotions don't matter and the effort I put forth is  disregarded at a moments notice. I am being discarded by the person who supposedly loves me and I don't feel like I have anywhere to turn.


I tried this morning to open conversation by getting her a coffee and bringing it home to her after the gym. 

I tried talking to her and her response was ""i can't work on resolving things when you just make me feel the way you do""

I am honestly hurt and dumbfounded because I try my best. I didn't raise my voice or cuss. I dont call anyone names. But I am painted as a villian. Bad guy, manipulator. I am called names even when I'm on vacation 3k miles away.

I'd like some genuine advice because I do love her but I am hurt

Coffee is more than a drink; it’s a ritual. The aroma, the taste, the warmth—all contribute to a perfect experience. Many people seek the best way to brew their coffee at home. With so many methods and tips out there, it can get confusing.

This guide will simplify the process. You will learn the essential steps to make the best coffee. Whether you are a beginner or a coffee enthusiast, you will find valuable tips here. Let’s dive into the world of coffee and discover how to make your perfect cup.

# Coffee Selection

Making the best coffee starts with one key element: coffee selection. The beans you choose and the roast they undergo can significantly impact the taste and aroma of your final cup. A great coffee experience begins with understanding these essential components.

# Choosing Beans

Choosing the right coffee beans can be a delightful journey. Beans come from various regions, each offering unique flavors. Consider these factors when selecting your coffee beans:

* **Origin:** Coffee beans from different regions have distinct taste profiles. For instance, Ethiopian beans often have floral and fruity notes, while Brazilian beans might be more nutty and chocolatey.
* **Variety:** There are two main types of coffee beans: Arabica and Robusta. Arabica beans are known for their smooth, sweet taste and higher acidity. Robusta beans are stronger and have a more bitter flavor.
* **Processing Method:** The way beans are processed also affects their flavor. Washed beans tend to be cleaner and brighter, while naturally processed beans are fruitier and heavier.

To help you decide, here’s a quick comparison of Arabica and Robusta beans:

|Feature|Arabica|Robusta|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Flavor|Smooth, Sweet|Bitter, Strong|
|Caffeine Content|Lower|Higher|
|Acidity|Higher|Lower|

Consider what you enjoy in a cup of coffee. Do you prefer a smooth and sweet taste? Arabica might be your best choice. Or do you like a strong and bitter flavor? Then Robusta could be perfect for you.

# Understanding Roasts

The roast level of your coffee beans is equally crucial. Roasting affects the color, flavor, and aroma. Here’s what you need to know:

**Light Roasts:** These beans are light brown and have a higher acidity. They retain more of the original flavors of the bean, such as floral or fruity notes. Light roasts are great for those who enjoy a brighter coffee.

**Medium Roasts:** Medium roasts are a balance between acidity and body. They are medium brown and have a slightly sweet flavor with more body than light roasts. This roast is ideal for those seeking a well-rounded cup.

**Dark Roasts:** Dark roasts are dark brown to almost black. They have a bold, smoky flavor, and the original bean flavors are less pronounced. This roast is perfect for those who prefer a strong, rich coffee.

Here’s a quick guide to help you understand the differences:

|Roast Level|Color|Flavor Profile|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Light|Light Brown|Bright, Fruity, High Acidity|
|Medium|Medium Brown|Balanced, Sweet, Medium Acidity|
|Dark|Dark Brown/Black|Bold, Smoky, Low Acidity|

To sum up, choose your roast based on what you enjoy in your coffee. If you like a bright and fruity cup, go for a light roast. If you prefer a balanced and sweet coffee, medium roast is the way to go. For a bold and strong flavor, opt for a dark roast.

1ji1ipd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkNarrations/comments/1ji1ipd/thanks_for_being_our_cat_therapist/,Thanks for being our Cat Therapist,"Haai Haai Mark,

Long time lurker and listener here!*(always on the way back of work I listen and go through a role coaster of emotions, to the range of OMG,, WHYY and DUMBUTSS! Yes sometimes scream-ish*). Sorry for any typos and maybe rambling.... XD

  
We have a new cat an elderly cat of 9,5 half years*(we found out after we got him)* but its oke and was terrified.

  
Before I get into Kiwi, some background;

This is not my first *(elderly)* Cat, I've had several *(6, and lived to the ages of 18 till 23 years)*, it is the first official cat for my SO. He did lived with my last cat Gypsy but she already was acclimatized to a non violent household, so she was his first and was deaf so loud noises were not bothering her. Gyspy stole my SO XD I just was the third wheel, and was fine by me and he opened up her personality even more so DEF for the win in my eyes.

Eventually she was just 1 month short of 23 years old and became ill, infection of the liver but we caught it to late and it destroyed her liver and needed to put her down. IT was hard for both of us because I had her for 13 years *(got her when she was 10, I'm giving her that extra month she earned it, haha!)* and the first pet of my SO and he took it hard and rightfully so because he had a connection with her. 

So we took the time to heal mentally, did some renovations in the house and after 2 years we wanted to expand our family with a cat. We are always on the same wavelength and want an elderly or older cat no ""no teenagers"", in cat ages if you get my drift. 

So for searching and meeting some cats we eventually got Kiwi *(officially he had a different name, but hated it and he just didn't react on that name*). had a meeting with the owners and he beamed love to the owners with his eyes, and that is how we fell in love with him and wanted to adopt him. At first the owners told us the wanted to replace him because of allergies form the baby, but later we found out it was a lie, they didn't know how/wanted to do both caring for a cat and a baby *(we found this out later)*.

When adopting a pet I always give the old owners the choice how they want to proceed, because it can be difficult to give up a pet. So I can pick them up or they can bring him/her and see where their loved pet will live. This time was weird and went back and fort between picking Kiwi up and bringing him. They brought him and I can only call it the Trip Of HELL for Kiwi.

We had the drop of in the morning, then he would have the whole day to get used to us and his new home, I knew it was going to be difficult, but his old owners didn't make it easy for him. They transported him in the truck alone and in the dark, he knew something was up. I had coffee and cookies ready so they had the time to say goodbye to their beloved pet. The husband did not leave the car, they brought the kid who was supposedly allergic in the same car*(WTFFF)*.

She came in with the pet-carrier and we almost pucked because of the crap odor, because Kiwi was in the truck he was justified scared, so scared he shit himself and the carrier. This was his road to hell literally *(that is how I'm calling it because as a pet owner I would never put a cat in the trunk where they cant see me)*. We offered coffee and a place to sit but she said she needed to go, she was inside *(cleaned the cat with me with whipes)* for 8 minutes and left, I got a notification on the door camera from entering and leaving. No old stuff from the cat no toys anything, we still had most from what we had with Gyspy, with some new toys. 

Then he stayed under the couch for hours/days... but we kept our distance, did our daily things and acting normally, *(but on the inside we wanted to hug him and comfort him, but we only met him once so that would be weird and shit)* .. so to get through the day I just started watching some old videos of you Mark and he came from under the couch started exploring the room/house. we couldn't move or he would be back under the couch.... so during the weekend I was just binge watching everything hahaha and he even came on our laps and we could petting him.... and this happend over the first week. Every time he heard your voice he just relaxed!

  
Unfortunately we needed to take him to the vet(after 7 days we got him), because his breathing sounded funny, so I needed to put him in a carrier *( he saw me driving and every moment I did not let him out of my sight and vice versa)* You probably guessed it that didn't go well! Vet thought maybe infection in his throat so got some medication and back home he went to lay in his litterbox( and I felt like shit! *(cats only lay in litterboxes with high stress and unsafe living environment)* .... I kept my distance and started to watch you videos again .... and in no time he came back out. This happend several times with loud noises and unknown noises for him, sometimes he still reacts to hand movements like he gets a slap or something.  

So after a week we needed to do a check up with the vet, this time was much easier, still feared the carrier, but started playing Mark in the car and he was just chilling. When we came home I turned the tv on and the video from the car played further.... And Kiwi was just down with it when to his food bowl and started eating and chilling. So he is finally acclimating here, loves attention and playing with his toys.

The things we found out after the fact, they told us he was 7 but the info on his chip said 9,5 years, also they never changed the info on the chip so the breeder was still the owner on the chip. He has some trauma from being beat, was lonely and from the looks of it, no one spoke to him or called him by his name, weird, thats why the name change so easy I think. Oow and also,,, they told us he didn't liked new people and few days ago friend came by and he just plopped on their lap and started making biscuits... and damn those biscuits they are spicy*(aka painful XD hahaha)*

So thanks for you help Mark, hahaha!

plus some #cattax

Yes another tuxedo .... it just happend but totally different personalities

After we meet, if I reach out and thank someone for meeting me or something, they typically ask for a second date or we exchange numbers. 

If I don't reach out right away, at best they never will. Or, I get a note between 8-24hrs later saying they didn't feel a spark. Or, at worst I'll get an extremely lengthy (and inappropriate for the length of time we've known each other) ""break up "" message. 

Most of the time I am on the fence when I don't reach out first, but sometimes it is just that I'm genuinely busy and it hasn't been that long. Anyone else experience this? 

I know you're going to say that I'm taking too long to reach back out, but why is it the woman's job? We typically go dutch on the first date, so it's not like one person should be thanking the other for purchasing a meal or a coffee. Sometimes, I don't reach out within a few hours because (for instance) we meet for daytime coffee or lunch and then I return to work, make dinner for my kid time goes by quickly.

When my wife (gf at the time) found out, she was devastated. Mostly because of how she found out. I was sending lewd pics to strangers on Craigslist, she found the emails. 

It took years to rebuild her trust, and yeeeeears of slow exposure to my dressing to get to this point. Like damn near 15 years. 

A couple years ago, after I had started sex therapy, that's when I started to accept myself and embrace Krista.  I started *fully* dressing, started practicing makeup, bought wigs, breastplate, etc.  The therapy helped me be more confident with it, and be able to speak to my wife about it without feeling shamed.  That eventually led to her giving me some of her old clothes she was going to donate (this shirt is one of them).

After a dress and pic session (usually away on a work trip), I'd ask to show my wife the pics. She would say yes, and would compliment them. It meant a lot to me, hearing her validation.

We had set some ground rules a couple years back,  one being that she didn't want me to go out in public, due to the consequences of getting discovered (it wouldn't go well in my community). The other rule was that I couldn't dress when my daughter was home. She's only 4, and if she were to walk in, she would tell everyone she knew lol. 

A couple weeks ago, I was in Portland. I had the perfect opportunity to go out as Krista, without any chance of it getting back to my community. I was by myself on the trip, which is very uncommon for my work. 

I had planned all week to go out Friday night to a drag show. When the night came, I asked my wife what she thought, and she was pretty clearly upset that I wanted to. She said I could if I felt I needed to, but I knew it would cause problems if I did. So I stayed in. I didn't even dress on that trip. Her main concern was that there's a small chance I could've been attacked, and I'd end up making the news back home, effectively outing me to everyone.  I understood, but I felt pretty hurt having lost that opportunity.

The next week when I was home, I had to clean shave for a respirator fit at work, and asked my wife if I could dress (since I don't normally clean shave).   Again, she seemed upset/annoyed that I asked, since my daughter was in her room sleeping.

She said ""I guess, I can stay in my office and keep an eye out for her if she comes out of her room"". I didn't want to make her do that. So I didn't.

I was feeling very upset. Visibly upset.

We ended up talking, where I told her that after 30 years of being ashamed, I'm finally to a point where I'm not only not ashamed of it, but I'm proud of it, and it's lonely dressing by myself. I want to engage with others. Having two good opportunities in less than a week, and hearing ""no"" to both was pretty upsetting. 

She said she's fine with my dressing, but felt like I was being unfair by asking to do things that went against the rules we had set, and making her be the bad person by having to say no.

We had discussed having a girls night a few months ago, but nothing came of it.

I brought that up again, and she said she'd love that. She suggested I take my stuff with us on our upcoming trip out west for a wedding we're attending, and that we could do a girls night in the hotel. That sounded amazing! But I told her I would likely want some facial hair for the wedding (I'm in it).

I suggested the upcoming weekend, and we could have our daughter sleep over at the in-laws, and she said ""sure!""

So yesterday, we had sent off my daughter to the grandparents, and my wife and I went to the grocery store for snacks and wine!

I came down the stairs to her sitting on the couch, with all the snacks laid out on the coffee table, with two wine glasses 🥰

I joined her on the couch, and we spent the next several hours binging Love Is Blind, snacking, sipping wine and just chatting like the best friends we are ♥️

1ji18hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1ji18hd/anyone_find_help_with_waking_insomnia_i_am_very/,Anyone find help with waking insomnia? I am very worried about my husband.,"He falls asleep fast with some twitching. And then, most nights, get wakes up anywhere from 2a to 4am and can't fall back asleep, but occasionally does after an hour or two. Then he has to get up for work and he feels terrible and can barely handle any stress because he is exhausted. It often ruins our weekend plans because he can almost never get up early to do things. 

The only thing that has had an effect was taking DAO supplement with his meals, but it seems to be wearing off. Almost every night this week, he woke in the middle of the night and was up for hours. I'm thinking of having him try taking an antihistamine and see if that helps. He is also going to ween off of coffee, since that can't be helping. 

Has anyone found any literature explaining this phenomenon? Anyone try any supplements, dietary changes or lifestyle changes that helped? We are getting desperate. He has seen a doctor but they were mostly unhelpful. All they want to do is prescribe him medications but he doesn't want to be drugged into sleep. Seems like something is internally off and we want to figure out what.

Thanks for any help in advance.",2,1742742132.0,insomnia,1,1.0,False

1ji17lv,https://i.redd.it/nhp7gm6xegqe1.jpeg,Update: Last night was AMAZING! 🥰,"Growing up, hiding and being ashamed of my crossdressing, I was certain that I'd have to go through life keeping this side of me a secret, and that no woman would be okay with it. 

When my wife (gf at the time) found out, she was devastated. Mostly because of how she found out. I was sending lewd pics to strangers on Craigslist, she found the emails. 

It took years to rebuild her trust, and yeeeeears of slow exposure to my dressing to get to this point. Like damn near 15 years. 

A couple years ago, after I had started sex therapy, that's when I started to accept myself and embrace Krista.  I started *fully* dressing, started practicing makeup, bought wigs, breastplate, etc.  The therapy helped me be more confident with it, and be able to speak to my wife about it without feeling shamed.  That eventually led to her giving me some of her old clothes she was going to donate (this shirt is one of them).

After a dress and pic session (usually away on a work trip), I'd ask to show my wife the pics. She would say yes, and would compliment them. It meant a lot to me, hearing her validation.

We had set some ground rules a couple years back,  one being that she didn't want me to go out in public, due to the consequences of getting discovered (it wouldn't go well in my community). The other rule was that I couldn't dress when my daughter was home. She's only 4, and if she were to walk in, she would tell everyone she knew lol. 

A couple weeks ago, I was in Portland. I had the perfect opportunity to go out as Krista, without any chance of it getting back to my community. I was by myself on the trip, which is very uncommon for my work. 

I had planned all week to go out Friday night to a drag show. When the night came, I asked my wife what she thought, and she was pretty clearly upset that I wanted to. She said I could if I felt I needed to, but I knew it would cause problems if I did. So I stayed in. I didn't even dress on that trip. Her main concern was that there's a small chance I could've been attacked, and I'd end up making the news back home, effectively outing me to everyone.  I understood, but I felt pretty hurt having lost that opportunity.

The next week when I was home, I had to clean shave for a respirator fit at work, and asked my wife if I could dress (since I don't normally clean shave).   Again, she seemed upset/annoyed that I asked, since my daughter was in her room sleeping.

She said ""I guess, I can stay in my office and keep an eye out for her if she comes out of her room"". I didn't want to make her do that. So I didn't.

I was feeling very upset. Visibly upset.

We ended up talking, where I told her that after 30 years of being ashamed, I'm finally to a point where I'm not only not ashamed of it, but I'm proud of it, and it's lonely dressing by myself. I want to engage with others. Having two good opportunities in less than a week, and hearing ""no"" to both was pretty upsetting. 

She said she's fine with my dressing, but felt like I was being unfair by asking to do things that went against the rules we had set, and making her be the bad person by having to say no.

We had discussed having a girls night a few months ago, but nothing came of it.

I brought that up again, and she said she'd love that. She suggested I take my stuff with us on our upcoming trip out west for a wedding we're attending, and that we could do a girls night in the hotel. That sounded amazing! But I told her I would likely want some facial hair for the wedding (I'm in it).

I suggested the upcoming weekend, and we could have our daughter sleep over at the in-laws, and she said ""sure!""

So yesterday, we had sent off my daughter to the grandparents, and my wife and I went to the grocery store for snacks and wine!

I have adrenal pcos (too much adrenal hormone), slow COMt and adhd/anxiety. 

I’ve been feeling a lot of anxiety lately and panic attacks without anything to panic about. This has prompted me to really look into my health. I tried antidepressants and supplements and couldn’t find much help. 

Eventually I decided I will wean off caffeine slowly and switched to tea. 

Day 1-4
- Crazy Fatigue
- Just falling asleep everywhere at anytime 
- Gymming helped a lot with keeping me awake
- brain fog 
- small acne break out 
- waking up feeling like I haven’t slept at all 
- couldn’t really be social 

Day 5-7
- I feel relaxed and much happier. 
- I still ruminate and catastrophize (right after I drink tea too) 
- skin is less oily 
- emotionally stable 
- still feeling kinda bleh tired but not as bad. 
- I can’t stop pooping
- more mental clarity
- I’m starting to crave coffee a bit 

What’s weirding me out is that this is making me anti social. I don’t even want to interact with my boyfriend at times. I just can’t be bothered to deal with others or think too deeply about them.

1ji15sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1ji15sn/struggling_with_everyday_conversations_inspired/,Struggling with Everyday Conversations Inspired Me to Create an AI Practice App—Would Love Your Thoughts,"Hey everyone! I’ve been dealing with social anxiety for years—honestly, simple interactions like ordering coffee or asking for directions used to make my heart race and my mind go blank. For me, it felt like a big barrier in day-to-day life, and I realized **I’m probably not alone** in this.

**A Personal Little Story:**  
I remember one day at my local café, I froze up so badly ordering a latte that the barista had to gently prompt me, “Anything else?” I just stammered something incoherent and rushed away, embarrassed. It was such a small moment, yet it stuck with me. I kept thinking, “Why does this have to be so hard?” But since then, I’ve been on a journey to tackle these everyday fears—through small exposures, practice, and sometimes just mentally rehearsing conversations.

**The Idea Behind the App:**  
This got me thinking: *What if there were a quick and private way to practice short, real-life conversations—like talking to the barista, asking a co-worker for help, or politely leaving a gathering—before actually facing them in real life?*

1. You pick a **scenario**—like ordering coffee, chatting with a neighbour, or asking someone a question in class.
2. You **speak your response** out loud to the AI (no one else is listening).
3. In just a few seconds, the app gives **gentle feedback** on things like tone, clarity, or filler words—basically the stuff I always worried about messing up.
4. You can **try again** immediately or move on, learning small tips so that the *real* conversation feels less intimidating.

**Why I’m Reaching Out:**  
I’m posting here because I know everyone’s social anxiety story is unique. I want this app to actually *help*, not just be another tech novelty. So I’d love some feedback on whether this feels useful:

* **What sorts of everyday conversations cause you the most stress?** (Phone calls, small talk, asking someone for help, etc.?)
* **Do you prefer quick, bullet-point feedback, or a more detailed explanation?**
* **Are there any features** (like anxiety level tracking, encouraging messages, or safe mode) you’d like to see?

**Disclaimer**: I know this app isn’t a replacement for therapy or professional guidance—it’s more of a supportive tool you can use on the side to gain confidence. My hope is that by practicing these short, routine scenarios, we can build up enough comfort that these interactions feel less scary in the real world.

If you have any thoughts or suggestions, please let me know! My dream is for people who’ve felt that same panic I did at the café to have a gentle place to practice and grow more at ease in everyday life. Thank you for reading, and thank you even more if you choose to share your insights!

I was at that age where I had just started attending the Singles Ward, and I immediately refused to participate in any of the ""find a future husband"" games because I'd always been a complete outlier at family wards growing up, and this new situation was even worse at making me invisible. I'm autistic, have been overweight my entire life, can't stand most hair and makeup products due to sensory issues, and I knew I never stood a chance against all the pretty and perfect Molly Mormons who were the only ones getting attention. From the get go I didn't want to participate in anything and only went to appease my parents. I don't think a single man (besides the bishop) at that ward even talked to me, besides one who was clearly closeted. I hope he's left the church by now and embraced himself. 

I sat by myself, stayed quiet, and felt like I was just watching everyone else live their lives and be happy, while here I was somehow ""cursed"" that I could never have anything that they had. I had no intention of reeling in a future husband because I had already mentally left, and knew I never stood a chance anyways, but I hated continuing to ""play the game"" just to make my parents happy. 

Due to a very pushy bishop trying to make me participate more and the constant comparing of myself to all the successful and pretty girls in my ward, one day I just walked out and never came back. I made up an excuse to my parents that my hours at work had changed and I had to work Sundays now, while I was actually going to cafes and getting coffee during that time. Nobody ever tracked me down or made an effort to get me to come back to church, so gladly it all fizzled out and I didn't have to put on a face anymore.

I'm 33M & weigh 90kgs now.

I had back surgery begining of last year & was highly recommended to ditch the heavy weights for yoga & swimming. I had 3 months rehabilitation program & my physio recommended the same thing.

I started swimming again in December.
Focusing on just getting to 400m. 
Then 500m. Then 600m.

In March I decided to take it seriously.

I was aiming for 600m
Ended up doing 1km.

I took an iced coffee as pwo which is a TERRIBLE idea. 

Was sick with flu for a week. So didn't swim again until 20th.


Swim 2 -

Decided to break it up into 4 segments like a structured gym session so I wasn't fighting against the lack of oxygen in my body.
I used the main gym clock as my timer.
I had to wear a cap & goggles as per the gym rules.
I had been fasting for 18 hours so smashed a sugar free red bull as a pwo.

Swim 3 -

Decided to use my watch to time myself. It was a bit annoying as it locks with water droplets. It actually rebooted on the second segment.

Had someone swimming next to me so she was a great pacer it was really useful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're a coffee lover and an ice cream enthusiast, you'll be thrilled to discover how easy it is to make a delicious no-egg coffee ice cream right at home. This simple recipe takes you through each step, ensuring a smooth and creamy treat that's perfect for any occasion. So, let’s dive right into crafting this delightful dessert!

### Ingredients You’ll Need

- 2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 cup sweetened condensed milk
- 1 tablespoon instant coffee or espresso powder
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients

To start, gather all your ingredients. This makes the process smooth and efficient. Make sure your heavy whipping cream is very cold; this will help create the creamy texture. Your instant coffee or espresso powder should also be ready to go, as it adds that rich coffee flavor.

#### Step 2: Whip the Cream

In a large mixing bowl, pour in the cold heavy whipping cream. Using an electric mixer, whip the cream until it forms stiff peaks. This means the cream should hold its shape, standing tall when you lift the beaters out of the bowl. This step is crucial, as it provides the ice cream with that light and fluffy texture.

#### Step 3: Combine the Ingredients

In another bowl, mix the sweetened condensed milk, instant coffee powder, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Stir until the coffee powder is fully dissolved. The salt enhances the flavors, balancing the sweetness of the condensed milk.

#### Step 4: Fold in the Whipped Cream

Now, gently fold the whipped cream into the coffee mixture. Use a spatula and carefully combine them. You want to retain as much of the air in the whipped cream as possible. This will keep your ice cream airy and prevent it from being too dense. Fold until you see no more streaks of cream—just a beautiful, silky mixture!

#### Step 5: Freeze the Mixture

Transfer the blended mixture into an airtight container. Smooth the top with a spatula to level it out. Seal the container tightly to prevent ice crystals from forming. Pop it in the freezer for at least 6 hours, or until it's completely hardened. If you can, let it sit overnight for the best results!

#### Step 6: Serve and Enjoy

Once your ice cream is frozen, it's time to enjoy your creation! Use an ice cream scoop to serve up a generous portion. You can top it with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, or even a sprinkle of cocoa powder for added flavor. This no-egg coffee ice cream is perfect for a warm day or as a sweet end to any meal.

### Tips for Perfecting Your No-Egg Coffee Ice Cream

- **Use High-Quality Coffee:** The flavor of your ice cream hinges on the coffee you use. Choose a favorite blend for the best taste.
- **Experiment with Mix-Ins:** Consider adding chocolate chips, nuts, or caramel swirls for an extra kick.
- **Adjust Sweetness:** If you prefer a less sweet treat, use unsweetened heavy cream or reduce the amount of sweetened condensed milk.

This no-egg coffee ice cream recipe provides a delightful way to enjoy your favorite flavors in a frozen dessert. With just a few simple steps, you'll have a velvety smooth treat that will impress your friends and family. Enjoy crafting this flavorful ice cream and adding it to your dessert repertoire!

Making no-egg coffee ice cream at home is not only easy but also a fun and rewarding experience. It offers a creamy, rich treat that can be enjoyed any time of the year. Get ready to indulge in a scoop of creamy goodness that satisfies your coffee cravings!

The Benefits of No-Egg Ice Cream Recipes for Dairy-Free and Vegan Enjoyment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

No-egg ice cream recipes are becoming increasingly popular, especially among those looking for dairy-free or vegan treats. With the rise of plant-based diets and the desire for healthier desserts, these recipes offer a delightful alternative that keeps flavors intact without compromising texture. Let's explore the many benefits of making no-egg ice cream and why it might be the perfect option for you.

​ Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ​  
  
One of the primary advantages of no-egg ice cream recipes is that they cater to a wider audience, including those with egg allergies or intolerances. By eliminating eggs from the ingredient list, you open up the world of ice cream to individuals who previously had to miss out on this classic dessert. This inclusivity fosters a sense of enjoyment for everyone, regardless of dietary restrictions.

Moreover, vegan ice cream recipes often prioritize natural ingredients. In a world where people are becoming more conscious of what they consume, opting for plant-based versions allows for more control over ingredients. Most no-egg ice creams use fresh fruits, nuts, and alternative milks, providing a healthier dessert option rich in vitamins and nutrients. Some common ingredients include:

- Coconut milk
- Almond milk
- Cashews
- Fruits like bananas, strawberries, and mangoes
- Sweeteners such as maple syrup or agave nectar

Another compelling reason to try no-egg ice cream is its simplicity. Many recipes are straightforward, requiring just a few ingredients and minimal preparation time. You don’t need an ice cream maker to whip up a batch. Many no-egg ice creams can be made using a blender or food processor, making it easy to create delightful desserts in the comfort of your home.

Texture is another noteworthy benefit of no-egg ice cream. While traditional recipes often rely on eggs for creaminess, alternative ingredients such as avocados or bananas can achieve that smooth and melting mouthfeel effectively. these natural substitutes not only enhances texture but also brings unique flavors to the forefront. You can experiment with different fruit combinations to find the perfect flavor profile that excites your taste buds.

Creating no-egg ice cream at home also allows for personalization. You can adjust the sweetness, flavor, and consistency to suit your preferences. Whether you prefer a rich chocolate flavor or a zesty citrus note, the freedom to add or subtract ingredients helps you achieve your ideal dessert. This flexibility can be particularly enjoyable for families, as children can participate in the ice cream-making process, choosing their favorite flavors and toppings.

Environmental considerations also come into play when choosing no-egg ice cream recipes. Dairy farming has a significant environmental impact, and switching to plant-based alternatives can help reduce your carbon footprint. By making your own ice cream with no animal products, you support sustainable practices and enjoy a guilt-free dessert.

Let’s not forget the cost-effectiveness of crafting no-egg ice cream at home. Store-bought vegan ice creams can often be pricier than traditional options. By making your own, you save money while creating a delightful treat that's just as satisfying. Plus, you control the quality of the ingredients, ensuring a premium product without breaking the bank.

For those looking for creative ideas, some easy no-egg coffee ice cream recipes can give your desserts a caffeine kick. Imagine blending coconut milk with chilled brewed coffee, sweetening it naturally, and freezing it for a creamy and refreshing treat. The combination of coffee and ice cream is a match made in heaven, perfect for an afternoon snack or after-dinner indulgence.

1ji0xly,https://i.redd.it/h20uth3ocgqe1.jpeg,What if I Had Been Born a Man?,"What If I Had Been Born a Man?

Like every morning, I turned on the coffee machine. While it heated up, I fixed my hair and let the usual thoughts flow: the weather, things to do, some vague reflections.

The night before, I had been in a small bar with loud music, maybe to cover the silence or to make communication harder. A cute and confident guy had approached me, wanting to get to know me, and offered me a drink. I chose a beer, something easy to sip. He made a move, but discreetly, waiting for my signal, which didn’t take long to arrive. We talked about nothing in particular, just small talk, but in a light and fun way. Between songs, we laughed a little.

He invited me outside to talk better, but it was just an excuse to steal a kiss. I gladly kissed him back. As always in these situations, we exchanged phone numbers, and I went home—I had to wake up early the next morning.

Now, thinking back, he didn’t really impress me. Maybe not at all. But I’m single, and there’s nothing wrong with meeting new people. And yet, deep down, that lingering sense of inadequacy remained, as if I were doing something wrong. After all, I’m the one who chooses—I keep telling myself that. But is that really true? Or do we choose each other out of fear of loneliness, for validation, to feel like we exist?

And if I had been born a man, would I think the same things?

1ji0wky,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ji0wky/my_ex_is_still_causing_drama_after_a_year/,My ex is still causing drama after a year,"Soo... this story might be out of order because a lot has happened, but here I go. First time poster, and english is not my first language. And fair warning, I am not a good story teller.

I (currently 28F) had a boyfriend (currently 35M) for almost 2 years. Let's call him Lawrence. We knew each other since I think, 2017, when I was a first year in university. During that time I had another boyfriend, which is irrelevent in this story tho. I introduced Lawrence to my now ex best friend (now 27F), let's call her Lina, and they seemed to hit it off. At least at first. After a while they got into fights for basically bs things. She would get mad and seeked attention by coming to the kitchen while I was cooking and would start to cry. At first I would try to console her but after a while I just got tired of always consoling her. Forgot to mention. I lived with her for a couple of years. 

During that time we went on a couple's date to a bar. My first boyfriend got angry at me and yelled at me at the bar for spilling his beer on his beard (it was an accident). I just got up and left. Lina followed me and we went home. During the night my Lina let my then boyfriend in, although I was actually thinking of breaking up with him, and we actually ended up getting back together. I was too weak to say no at the time. But because I stayed with him I think I might have been psychologically abused. I have a hard time dealing with and talking about death because of my dad's death. And that bf actually talked about how he was going to kill himself after a while and so on. I was afraid to break up with him because I thought he might actually kill himself if I broke up with him. So, I stayed in suffering for another 9 months with him until I finally had courage to leave him. During this time when I was dating this guy my roommate-friend would break up and get back together with Lawrence. Most of the time they would get back together because I would end up meddling into it. I would ask them both if they wanted to be together or not and if both said yes I would just tell him to get to our place and just to talk it out. I never forced them to do anything they didn't want. I didn't tell them to get back together or anything like that but I would just tell them to talk. After a few months I ended up getting the opportunity to go to Japan for exchange and studied there for a year (2019-2020). After I got back I found out they had broken up and I didn't do anything about that because it was not my place and I didn't want any more drama. 

A year after I got back from Japan, I moved back again to that city (after Japan I stayed in my hometown cuz of covid). I rented an apartment and I met with Lawrence for coffee. I didn't think anything of it as I thought we were just friends. He oftenly asked my to meet up, to watch a movie at my place but I rarely said yes because I didn't really want to be alone with him (my subconciousness apparently knew that it was not a good idea tho I had no clue myself). We would go to karaoke bar, I would bring Lina with me as well, because she barelly had any friends and would only lock herself in her room and stay there day in and day out. At some point I started noticing Lawrence kept following me in and out of the balcony at the bar, and my other besty told me that he might actually like me. I didn't believe her, I was really oblivious, I know, my perception is -100 as I always say. Btw, I forgot to mention, Lina got herself a new boyfriend during this time. I was happy for her, but even though I had no thoughts of getting together with Lawrence at that time she would constantly tell me to never get together with him and such. She had a boyfriend but still it would hurt her if she saw me with him. Maybe I am a bit of an a-hole here, but even though for a few months I kept rejecting him, his messages that he saw the lights in my window would creep me out. I consulted Lawrence's brother about how to tell him straight up so that he would understand that I had no interest with him, and he would try to help me but Lawrence would still do what he wanted and would constantly pursue me. At some point I ended up liking his friend, but that was short lived as we went on only 1 date. Would have been more but Lawrence interfered and his friend didn't want to ruin his friendship with Lawrence. I was hurt, but understood. However, I got really angry at Lawrence and tried to cut ties with him but at some point I ended up forgiving him.

After Lawrence's 34th birthday, we went to a few dates and I don't undestand how but I fell for him and my friend Lina got angry at me and severed ties with me and that was how my friendship with her and our circle friends sided with her. I don't really understand what the big deal was, because at the time we got together she had broken up with Lawrence for 3 years if not more and she already had a boyfriend but okay. My besty sided with me and we still are as close as ever. So, going back to the story. After dating for a year I ended breaking things off with Lawrence, because he started drinking a lot. At the beginning of the relationship he actually had the nerve to tell me that he was drinking because of Lina, but now that he was with me he didn't want to drink that much. Buuut now he is again drinking. Wtf? And he has an apartment if you can even call it that, basically it was apartment that only had a bed, table for his pc, and a toilet. nothing else. The apartment was set up for renovation and for 7 years that he had this apartment he hadn't done anything with it. During the time we were dating I tried to help him with the apartment, planning and such and he said that he would renovate the house so that it would be livible until summer, so that we could live together. That didn't happen. Then he said until new years, spring, summer, and so on. after breaking up the first time, he didn't try to fight it as I said that we should take a break. But I was depressed and scared to be alone, I took him back. Then year later I broke up with him because I started drinking antidepressants, going to therapy as I had a lot of problems. My therapist suggested that I should start writing a diary. I had a hard time with emotions. for 15 years I suppressed my emotions. But because I started drinking antidepressants for the first time in 15 years I felt happiness in me. That was when I started understanding that Lawrence was dragging me down emotionally, he didn't try to be better, he worked the job he hated because he was lazy to find another and so on. After breaking up with him I actually felt like a stone was lifted from my heart. I felt way better. 

Breakup happened over a text. I know it is stupid, not nice. He tried to influence me for us to take a break only, but I stayed firm. If I had done this in person, he would have manipulated me into only taking a break for a while or just not break up at all. While writing in my diary I understood that I was afraid of him. Of what he could do psychologically to me. He is a manipulative, lying a-hole. My besty told me that during our dating he actually talked about our sex stuff, like why I didn't like it when he went down on me as he thought he was really good. He sucked. And he lied to me during our time together that he finished his police academy, while he told my besty that he didn't. When I started dating another guy after our breakup, he had the nerve to question me and got angry when I said to him that it was not his business. He started spreading lies to everyone saying I left him for another and so on. 4 months later after breaking up during my besty's birthday he got drunk af which he said to my friend he did it only to not profess his love to me. A month after, he got a girlfriend, who dumped him after a few dates. Then another one who he told his friends about and talked bad about her stating she is ugly and such, which was not true at all. She was on a bigger side but she was really pretty and cute. Never kissed her in front of anyone. Oh, forgot to mention, he thought himself to be the most important person, said he was really smart, and that he knew a lot of people. None of which is true. Even his best friend doesn't hang out with him, and his brother is avoiding him a bit. 

During autumn of 2024 (broke up that year at the end of spring) I got together with an amazing man who understands me, loves me, doesn't lie and says everything straight. He boosts my self confidence, when I need a shoulder to cry on he is always there, even during his gameplay. He loves games and plays them often, but in his eyes I am more important to him. After 2 weeks of dating we moved in together at his place that he rented and after 2 more weeks we rented a place together. My current bf helps me overcome all my insecurities that being with Lawrence brought out and multiplied in me. Now it is spring and my ex (Lawrence) actually spread a lie about me stating that I apparently slept with his brother during our time of dating. That did not happen. I am glad that my besty told me of such a lie circulating and informed her friend who was with her at the time that it was not true. I am really waiting for the time when Lawrence's brother will find out about the lies he tells everyone. I felt like punching him or slapping him, but my bf calmed me down. My bf told me that he better not meet him again because if he saw him he might actually beat the shit out of him and I don't want my man to use any energy on that piece of shit ex.

Any of you have a clue how to deal with such an ex? I have been ignoring him and just staying away, did not spread any lies about him nor tried to (he actually thinks so) steal his friends by telling them not to be Lawrence's friends. Like, am I in kindergarten? I just try my best to ignore the shit he does and I thought it was finally over but after almost a year he still tries to ruin my reputation and probably thinks that my bf will leave me if he finds out the lie he said of me sleeping with his brother. I tell my bf everything and we trust each other. 

So, guys, do you have any suggestions how to deal with a lying, manipulative narcisist of an ex?

Folks, I need to vent and I'll try to keep it somewhat engaging. I’ve been job hunting in Toronto for months now (since Nov 2024). I have two professional degrees and a resume that’s been polished more times than a TikTok influencer’s skincare routine. And yet, here I am, still refreshing linkedin like it’s a slot machine that might finally pay out. spoiler - it doesn’t.

With +10 CAD yoe, I’ve applied to everything from junior roles to senior roles, you name it. I’ve tailored cover letters and resumes so specific to JDs and networked harder than a WiFi router in a coffee shop. And what do I have to show for it? A bunch of “We regret to inform you” emails and a creeping suspicion that my degrees are just expensive wall art now. Honestly, at this point, my job prospects are so bleak I’m waiting for something big to happen like WW3 and or GTA 6 - both of which could potentially lower the pool of competition.

So, tell me - am I cursed or alone in this mess of a situation, or is this just the TO job market flexing its dystopian chaos? Should I just hold out for the post-apocalyptic gig economy? At least then I can put “survived the end of the world” on my resume. Probs still won’t be enough for a junior role, though. We shall see.

She will jump on the bed, walk all over us and meow in our faces non-stop for 10 min, leave, and come back after 15 min. She does this repeatedly every 15 min until we get up. She can do this for 1-2 hours. It’s pretty wild. 

We:
1. Play with her pretty intensely for ~2 hours per day. Including about 45 min before bed. She is completely passed out for those first 5 hours. She’s not lacking stimulation. 
2. Ensure she has food when she cries. 

This started since we moved. She used to have a friend and they both used to not sleep with us. We didn’t let them. She would only start meowing outside of the door after 7-8 hours. Once we moved countries and rehomed her friend, we let her sleep with us because we felt bad putting her out of the room in a new home. That was 4 months ago. 

We really really need sleep. The issue seems to be that she just wants us to get up to be together. The moment we are up, making coffee, doing chores, etc, she relaxes and goes to sleep. The hardest part is that she’s clearly tired and will sleep as soon as we are awake. 

Any advice on how to get her to realize that when we aren’t getting up, we just need more sleep? We don’t mind her in the room. But we need the meowing and crying in our faces to stop. ",3,1742740991.0,CatAdvice,5,1.0,False

I've even slept with two narcissistic women(Rule #1 was broken...). Their abuse had a common link and I thought it was some kind of bible and set of rules. And I was kind of on the money as they played by a shared, unspoken book of rules. Each narcissist is still an individual, but every last one of them shares a common creed they are unwilling to break. A shared unspoken religion... With that in mind, I've decided to bring up something I saw that completes the whole thing.

I present to you...







# The Narcissist's Prayer

I have stumbled upon a secret into the minds of every narcissist in the world who has ever lived, lives, and ever will live. One crafty individual had risked their life to bring us this sacred knowledge and survived to share it. This brave soul's name will be remembered...

Hillario M(known also as (@)dama2614 on youtube) shared the narcissists' secret prayer that gives the narcissist their narcissistic powers from their false gods(themselves).

Let us pick apart this foul prayer!

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**THE NARCISSIST'S PRAYER:**

**That didn't happen.**

**And if it did, it wasn't that bad.**

**And if it was, that's not a big deal.**

**And if it is, that's not my fault.**

**And if it was, I didn't mean it.**

**And if I did...**

**You deserved it!**

  
  
  
  
  
  
Here's the breakdown.

**""That didn't happen""**

They reject the truth and substitute their own version of it. Narcissists hate the truth unless it aligns with their perception.

**""If it did, it wasn't that bad.""**

This is the part where little things are nothing to them. Repeating the same offence means nothing as the original offence is an isolated incident instead of a recurring behaviour. Constantly insulting your significant other or small things about you isn't wrong as far as they're concerned. Forgive them even once and it's their standard.

**""If it was, that's not a big deal.""**

Consequences mean nothing. They attack your core values one day and invite you for coffee the next day. They see nothing wrong with that. If you had a heated argument from diametrically opposed perspectives on an issue of ethics(you question the efficacy of education, health care, and law enforcement while the other person advocates for depopulation), they'll demand or request you still hang out over a cup of coffee.

**""And if it is, that's not my fault.""**

No matter what they do, they'll always have some excuse as to why it wasn't their fault. The circumstances could have facilitated their toxic behaviour. 'You live too close to a place that triggers me' or 'It seemed like a good idea because I needed something'.

**""And if it was, I didn't mean it.""**

This is their last line of defence before it turns darker. They will resort to regret. ""I didn't mean to do that"" becomes weaponised. They're not sorry for hurting anyone. What they really ""didn't mean"" was they ""didn't mean"" for you to put two and two together.

**""And if I did... You deserved it!""**

The most twisted justification of all. This excuses their bad behaviour entirely in their minds. This is the ultimate rejection of accountability. What they did becomes your fault in their minds. If they put a knife in your ribs, they think you deserved it for tarnishing their reputation by successfully calling them out in front of their ""other supplies"". You ""deserved"" that knife they put there. Emphasis on quotation marks. ""You deserved it"" justified some very twisted acts in history. Genocides begin with ""You deserved it"" from dictators.

  
  
  
  
  
  
Let's debunk these ones one at a time.

**It did happen** \- No lie in the world can rewrite the truth. If it happened, it happened and nothing can deny that.

**It was pretty bad** \- Not only did it happen, they did something to elicit the reaction they're dealing with. And it was likely bad.

**It was a big deal** \- They're pretending their shitty acts are just a normal part of life. But let's face it. They likely either did something big or repeated a small act of disrespect over and over again. Even if it wasn't a big deal, it becomes a big deal when it's a repeat offence.

**It's (likely) their fault** \- Even if you did something wrong, you are not responsible for their actions. Whatever happened to them is likely overshadowed by their reactions. Their idea of eye for an eye is taking out the entire socket over a splinter.

**They meant it** \- No amount of justification can deflect otherwise. If they didn't, they likely have zero control of their emotions. But they usually do mean what they did. If all parties involved are adults, all parties should understand that impulsive behaviour never yields good consequences.

**You never deserved it** \- No matter what you did, you are very unlikely to deserve what they did to you in retaliation. Getting a detail wrong is not grounds for being devalued. Walking away to protect yourself does not give them a valid reason for their smear campaign. And that knife heading for your ribs? Is that an appropriate response for confronting a neverending stream of disrespect? NO!!",1,1742740827.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,0.99,False

1ji0pyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ji0pyf/bought_new_machinenew_grinder_needed/,Bought New Machine…New Grinder Needed?,"Hello all, first time poster here. Question for all you espresso geeks who demand the most from your home brews:

I just purchased my “forever” espresso machine. It’s a Profitec Drive dual boiler with a Rotary pump. The machine is a beast, and it will last me a lifetime. I have it all dialed in now with a programmed pre-infusion, flow control, PID, etc. So far, I love it! However, with a machine like this, I am now noticing the shortcomings of my process, namely weighing out the grinds, and getting inconsistent shots. Some shots are amazing, some are, meh. But even the amazing ones don’t have a lot of distinct flavor. Which leads me to look at my grinder. 

This is my current grinder: 

https://www.wholelattelove.com/products/pasquini-lux-coffee-grinder?srsltid=AfmBOopASs0cMEVdMh2oTwhpZ52oNspTTYf0k6VuxLCTAuYHX2isQiJv

It seems to work fine, but it might just seem that way. It’s made for espresso, but I know there are varying degrees of quality. I use a naked portafilter, stirrer, a distributor, and a tamper in my shot process, and the shots pull evenly. But sometimes they pull faster, sometimes they pull slower. This has to do with the fact that I am not measuring out the grams and not being consistent with the tamp pressure. I could change this but I don’t have a lot of time in the morning before work. 

Soooo, to my question. If I get a grinder like a Eureka Mignon Libra 65 that weighs out the dosage to within 0.1g, I should be able to solve my dosing and tamp pressure problem because I could adjust my distributor depth so that I don’t need to tamp anymore (it would become my tamp) and I would get consistency amongst my shots and truly dial it in (and save time in the process).

But based on my current grinder, would I also be able to extract more of the unique flavors of the coffee if I went with this new grinder? I don’t feel like I can right now. What I get right now is “sweet”, “earthy”, “sour”, “bitter”, etc….depending on how careful I am with the grind and tamp process. But I’m looking for “blueberry”, “citrus”, “chocolate”, etc…individual flavors, not generalized sensations, if you will. 

Will a Eureka Mignon Libra (65mm) solve my problems?

Oh, and before anyone says, “Buy better coffee, stupid!”…..I AM!! My go to is Chocolate Fish, Ritual, Verve, etc. Always bought inside of a week from roasting date. Typically single origin Ethiopias (I LOVE the blueberry profiles).

Thanks for any advice!

Being vulnerable carries an inherent risk but with right person makes it all worth it

I think most of us are afraid in some sense to love and to be completely vulnerable yet despite the risk we long for it.

I find myself deeply longing for a sincere and profound connection. Hopefully, you are looking for the same?

The capacity to love, sometimes even in the face of pain, is one of the most beautiful aspects of being human. It's a strength, and not always a weakness.

At my core, I'm a person of love, of care, of deep unyielding affection for those I hold dear.

Through the journey of healing and self-discovery, I've realized that I have much love to share. Love that is not bitter, but kind; not resentful, but forgiving; not closed, but open and willing to grow alongside someone special.

I'm invested in my attempt to forge a connection and hope you are too, I'd try to share things about me that might give you idea of the person I am.

**Essence of Me:**

I am a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions.

I’m someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence.

I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm)
* Build: Slim
* Hair: Straight Deep black, kept in check
* Eyes: Brown
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed
* Complexion: Tanned, Caramel toned

**Interests:**

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care.

To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc

**What I Am Looking For:**

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together.

Expectations:

* Mutual respect and understanding
* Openness and honesty in communication
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together

**The Quest for You:**

What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that’s both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one’s soul.

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:**

If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you – not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn.

Laconic messages with just ""hi"", ""what's up,"" and the likes will be most likely ignored. If I can beat my own laconism when introducing myself here, so can you.",1,1742740488.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

The scent of coffee had seeped into the walls, lingering in the air despite no beverages being consumed at the conference, a testament to the long hours spent in the building. 

https://preview.redd.it/v2k8vvmr9gqe1.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dd4ef579d8fbdc468962c3fb696c598350559c7

Seated on one side of the table, Gene Kerman leaned back slightly in his chair, his expression welcoming but measured. Beside him, Jebediah sat with a familiar air of relaxed confidence, arms resting on the table, his ever-present grin making it impossible to tell if he was entirely serious or quietly entertained by the proceedings.

Across from them sat Milnard and Seecas, the CEO and COO of the Experimental Engineering Group, one of the most prominent research firms supporting the space program. Milnard’s tone was warm yet professional as she opened the discussion.

“Thank you for agreeing to meet with us,” said Milnard. “We are excited to actually see where the Icarus Program is running the space program.”

“Glad to show you around,” said Gene. “You Science Jr has been invaluable to our research, and we are looking forward to deploying your upcoming infrared telescope.”

Seecas, leaned forward, his eyes alight with the spark of enthusiasm. “One day we may be talking about performing science on asteroids and comets found by the telescope. I look forward to what science we might be able to haul into Kerbin orbit one day.”

“One day I’m flying a comet past Kerbin,” Jebediah grinned broadly.

“So what is it we can do for you?” asked Gene. “This is the first time you have requested an in person meeting.”

“We saw the Walter Kerman report where Bob mentioned you were working toward sending tourists to space,” Milnard folded her hands neatly on the table. “We would like to formally request the honor of being the first tourists to travel to space.”

“I respect your request, and that you are the only ones to make the request in person,” smiled Gene, his expression polite but measured. “However I should point out that quite a few others have already made the same request. Not to bargain, but why should we grant your request, beyond being significantly more humble than nearly all of the previous requests.” The corner of Gene’s lip twitched slightly with amusement.

Seecas was ready with his response. “First, we understand that the inaugural tourist flight will have a capacity of four Kerbals,” he said and Gene nodded in response. “The two of us are deeply interested in being a part of this first tourist mission to space, and we have a proposition that we believe will significantly benefit the Icarus Program, more than enough compensation to justify allowing us as the first tourists to travel to space. We propose that the Experimental Engineering Group will fund the third seat on the mission for Walter Kerman, ensuring the mission receives the publicity that will come from a firsthand report by the legendary journalist.”

Gene and Jebediah exchanged a surprised glance. The offer was as unexpected as it was compelling. “An intriguing offer, that kind of publicity could be very valuable.” Gene paused thoughtfully and then continued. “I have to make it clear that there will not be a fourth tourist seat. These initial missions will be flown by an experienced pilot, not by a computerized piloting system.”

“This was another request we wanted to make,” Seecas turned to face Jebediah. “We were hoping that Jebediah would pilot the first tourist mission for us.”

Gene and Jebediah glanced at each other again, this time with a heavier, unspoken meaning. This request was not unreasonable, but Jebediah was preparing for another spaceflight that would make him unavailable to fly the tourist mission. A spaceflight that had not yet been announced.

Jebediah paused for a moment to consider his words, then turned to Seecas, his grin softening into something more genuine. “I am flattered,” he said with a tinge of regret in his voice. “But I’m a test pilot, I fly rockets first and find out what their limits are. You would not want Walter to be on board such a flight.” Jebediah paused a moment in thought before nodding toward Gene. “For the first tourist flight you want Valentina as your pilot. There is no other pilot in the program that can take command of a rocket and ensure a flawless mission the way she can.”

Now Seecas and Milnard glanced at each other in surprise, Milnard nodded and Seecas turned back to Jebediah. “As much as we would like you to fly the mission, we agree, Valentina is an excellent alternative.”

“You said Walter was the first part of your offer?” prompted Gene, leaning forward.

Seecas smiled and Milnard took the lead. “Yes, the second part is that the Experimental Engineering Group would like to formally offer our services to help grow the Icarus Program. We believe in the scientific mission you have been pursuing, and feel the program’s science would benefit from scientists associated with our company performing long term research missions in space. To facilitate this, we are willing to fund the participation of scientists in these missions, in addition to offering other services to help grow your capabilities.”

“An interesting concept,” Gene leaned back in his chair and folded his arms as he considered the proposal. “But I have to be frank, this is not something the Icarus Program can support right now. Even once we launch permanent space stations, the first generation will only have enough supplies for our Kerbalnauts, plus very short term tourists. It may be some time before we can support a long term presence in space for more Kerbals.”

Milnard nodded in understanding. “We know the program is still in its early days, despite all of your accomplishments. We are prepared to collaborate on how such an arrangement could work as the technology involves.”

“Until then we have plenty of work with Megas assisting to complete your infrared telescope design,” said Gene. “Lizfal will be available to test your prototypes once they are ready.”

“Agreed,” Seecas nodded in agreement.

Gene and Jebediah glanced at each other and Jebediah nodded back.

“If Walter Kerman agrees to fly on the first tourist flight,” Gene broke into a broad smile. “We will be happy to fly you to space on the first tourist flight.”

With that, the two groups stood, exchanging firm handshakes, and the deal was sealed.

A couple of weeks ago, I had a dream and was woken up spiritually. I have been living for myself and my family without God in my life. When I woke up I had an overwhelming urge to pray like my Grandmother did when I was a child. I did. I prayed. I was convicted. 
And then I don’t know how to explain it, but I was spiritually hungry? I wanted to know Jesus. I bought a Bible and woman’s bible study book. I have been reading Matthew, Luke, Mark. My TikTok algorithm changed. When I’m in the car now for my work (I’m in my car most of my days) I found it soothing to listen to modern Christian music. I noticed a lot of wrong things in my life, I was living Godlessly, I asked Jesus to help me, save me and my family. 
I have cried and prayed so much over the past week. 
Well my husband is upset about my new found faith in Jesus. To the point now, he says things to me that is most unlike him. I woke up this morning and was going to make coffee before my Bible study. I went into the kitchen and found my teenage son made a big mess last night and left it, it was so easy for me to slip into my old habit of wakening him, telling him he needs to get up and pick all this up, using a little cuss words I admit and anger/frustration. And my husband overheard came in and was upset with me too. When we went back to our bedroom, I got out my Bible study and just said a prayer to help me not slip back into that, to forgive me, give me grace, help me be more reasonable and less quarrelsome. My husband then looks at me and says “If I wanted to marry a Bible school teacher I would have.” And a few other things that really just broke my heart, but I did not argue back. I know I need to pray on this. But does anyone have any wisdom? Should I do my Bible study and pray in secret around my husband? Should I set a boundary with him? I will say I heard in my heart Matthew 12:30 as I just read this verse a couple days ago. 
I also know it’s not my job to nag my husband, to convince him of God, that is between him and God. I just want my marriage to be okay but I do not want to loose my faith in sake of my marriage.

Today, we’re talking about something that could totally transform your small business: personalized customer experiences. Think about it—when’s the last time you felt really seen by a brand? Maybe they recommended the perfect product, remembered your birthday, or just got your vibe. That’s not magic; that’s personalization, and it’s becoming a game-changer for businesses, especially small ones like yours. With tools like data analytics and AI, you don’t need a huge budget or a massive team to deliver tailored services and products that keep customers coming back. It’s all about boosting satisfaction and loyalty—turning one-time buyers into raving fans. In this video, we’ll break down why this matters, how real small businesses are nailing it, and—most importantly—how you can start doing it too.

 Oh, and if you’re new here, hit that subscribe button—we’re all about helping you stand out and grow. Ready to make your customers feel like VIPs? Let’s dive in!

So, why is personalization suddenly the talk of the town? Simple: customers expect it. We live in a world where Netflix knows what we want to watch, Spotify curates our playlists, and Amazon suggests exactly what we need before we even search. Big brands have set the bar high, but here’s the good news—small businesses can play that game too.

 It’s not about size; it’s about connection. When you tailor your products or services to fit someone’s needs, you’re saying, ‘I get you.’ That builds trust, satisfaction, and loyalty—stuff money can’t buy.

Here’s where AI and data analytics come in. They’re like your behind-the-scenes superheroes. Data analytics crunches numbers—what are people buying? When? Why? AI takes it further, spotting patterns and predicting what customers might want next. Together, they help you offer experiences that feel personal without you having to guess. But let’s get introspective for a sec: Are you really connecting with your customers? Or are you treating them like just another sale? Because personalization isn’t just a perk anymore—it’s a differentiator. It’s what sets you apart in a crowded market. Stick around, because we’re about to see this in action.

Let’s look at some real examples. Imagine a small coffee shop—let’s call it Brew & You. They use a simple loyalty app that tracks what customers order most. With a little AI magic, the app notices Sarah loves oat milk lattes and John’s all about black cold brew. Next time they walk in, the barista’s already got a personalized suggestion ready—or even a discount on their fave. That’s not creepy; that’s thoughtful. Sarah and John feel valued, so they keep coming back. Loyalty skyrockets.

Or take an online boutique. They use data analytics to see that a chunk of their customers buy summer dresses in May. AI steps in, sending tailored emails with dress recommendations right when those customers are most likely to shop. Sales go up, and customers feel like the store gets them. The benefits are huge: happier customers, repeat business, and word-of-mouth buzz. Plus, you’re not wasting time or money on generic marketing that flops.

Here’s the deeper question: What do your customers want that you’re not giving them yet? Could personalization be the edge you need to stand out? Because here’s the truth—small businesses have an advantage. You’re nimble, you’re close to your customers, and with AI, you can turn that into a superpower.

Okay, let’s get you started. Personalization sounds fancy, but it’s totally doable—even if you’re not a tech expert. Here are three practical steps to make it happen.

First, gather your data. Look at what you already have—sales records, customer emails, social media comments. What patterns do you see? If you’ve got a website or online store, tools like Google Analytics can show you what people browse or buy. Start small; you don’t need a data empire.

Second, pick an AI-powered tool that fits your vibe. For email personalization, try Mailchimp—it uses AI to suggest send times and content. For e-commerce, Shopify’s built-in analytics can recommend products to customers. Even a free CRM like HubSpot can track preferences and help you follow up with tailored offers. Test one out—most have free versions.

Third, experiment and listen. Send a personalized thank-you email after a purchase. Offer a discount based on past buys. Ask for feedback and tweak as you go. The key is to start where you are and build.

Now, the introspective bit: Are you ready to invest a little time to make your customers feel special? Because personalization isn’t just about sales—it’s about relationships. And that’s where small businesses shine.

There you go—personalized experiences are your ticket to happier customers and a stronger business. With AI and data analytics, it’s easier than ever to make it happen. So, what’s your first step?

She turned to David, her smile bright and cheerful. “David, could you bring all my new clothes to my room? I want to start organizing my closet.”

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He followed Emma down the hallway, the weight of the bags pulling at his arms. When they reached her room, Emma gestured toward the closet, her tone casual but with a hint of expectation.

“Just set them down here,” she said, her voice bright. David set the bags down and turned to leave, but Emma stopped him, her tone sharp. “Where are you going?”

David hesitated, his voice quiet. “I… I thought I’d go do some schoolwork. I’ve got a lot to catch up on.”

Emma’s smile faltered slightly, and she tilted her head, her expression one of mild annoyance. “David, you didn’t understand me. You’re going to help me reorganize my closet. I’ll tell you where everything goes.”

David’s heart sank, but he didn’t argue. Instead, he nodded silently and began unpacking the bags, his movements slow and deliberate. Emma stood nearby, her arms crossed and her expression one of mild amusement as she directed him.

“Put those dresses on the bed,” she said, her tone casual. “And take everything out of the closet first. We’re starting from scratch.”

David did as he was told, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He pulled out Emma’s clothes—dresses, blouses, skirts, and jackets—and laid them carefully on the bed. The closet was soon empty, and Emma began sorting through the piles, her tone bright and cheerful.

“This goes here,” she said, pointing to a section of the closet. “And this goes there. Make sure everything is hung neatly, David. I don’t want any wrinkles.”

David nodded silently, his mind swirling with unspoken thoughts. He wanted to protest, to tell Emma that he had his own work to do, but the look in her eyes—bright and carefree—made it impossible to say no.

As they worked, Emma frowned, her expression one of mild frustration. “Hmm… I don’t think I have enough space in my closet,” she said, her tone casual. “I’ll be right back.”

Before David could say anything, Emma walked out of the room, her steps light and carefree. David hesitated, his mind racing. What was she doing? He wanted to follow her, but he didn’t dare. Instead, he stood there, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast, waiting for her to return.

A few minutes later, Emma walked back into the room, her smile widening as she saw him. “David, I’ve figured it out. I’m going to need part of your closet for my dresses and skirts. They take up too much space here.”

David blinked, his confusion evident. “My closet? But… where will I put my clothes?”

Emma shrugged, her tone casual but with a hint of expectation. “Oh, don’t worry. I’ve already taken care of that.”

David’s heart sank, but he didn’t argue. Instead, he followed Emma down the hallway to his room, his steps slow and deliberate. When they walked in, David’s eyes widened in shock. His clothes were scattered across the floor, his closet completely empty.

“Emma, what… what did you do?” he asked, his voice trembling.

Emma smiled, her tone casual but with a hint of amusement. “I cleared out your closet for my things. Don’t worry, your clothes are fine on the floor. You don’t need that much space anyway.”

David stared at her, his mind swirling with a mix of emotions—frustration, resentment, and a deep, aching sense of helplessness. He wanted to protest, to tell her that this wasn’t okay, but the look in her eyes—bright and carefree—made it impossible to say no.

Emma picked up a stack of dresses and skirts and handed them to David, her tone casual. “Here, hang these up in your closet. Make sure they’re neat, okay?”

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He walked over to the closet and began hanging up Emma’s clothes, his movements slow and deliberate. As he worked, Emma stood nearby, her smile widening.

“You know, David,” she said, her tone casual but with a hint of expectation, “now that you’re earning extra money from working at the coffee bar, I can shop even more. I’ll need this closet space for all my new things.”

David nodded silently, his mind swirling with unspoken thoughts. He wanted to feel proud of his efforts, to believe that he was doing the right thing, but the weight of the situation—and the lingering anxiety about his place in Emma’s life—made it hard to relax.

After hanging up Emma’s dresses and skirts in his now-emptied closet, David glanced at the clock and sighed. “Emma, I really need to study and catch up on schoolwork. I’ve got a lot to do, especially since I have to help John tomorrow night.”

Emma, who was lounging on her bed scrolling through her phone, looked up with a smile. “Oh, don’t worry about that. I already texted John, and he’s thrilled that I found him such a reliable dishwasher. But he did say Sunday might be really busy, so he needs you to come in early—starting in the afternoon.”

David’s eyes widened, and he shook his head. “Emma, I can’t. I have so much work to do. I need the afternoon to study.”

Emma’s smile didn’t waver, but her tone grew firmer, almost dismissive. “David, this isn’t up for debate. John and I have already discussed it, and it’s all settled. You’ll go in the afternoon, and that’s final. You need to show him that you’re reliable and that you can follow instructions. This is important.”

David opened his mouth to protest, but Emma cut him off with a wave of her hand, her tone sharp and commanding. “No arguments, David. John is your boss now, and when he says you need to be there, you’ll be there. End of discussion.”

David’s shoulders slumped, and he nodded silently, his frustration bubbling just beneath the surface. He wanted to argue, to tell her that he had his own responsibilities, but the weight of her words—and the fact that she and John had already decided without consulting him—made it impossible to speak up.

Emma’s smile returned, and she gestured to a pile of lingerie on her bed. “Now, let’s not waste any more time. You can still help me with something else before you go to bed.”

David hesitated, his voice quiet. “What else do you need?”

Emma’s smile widened, and she leaned back on her bed, her tone casual but with a hint of mischief. “You’re going to sort and organize my lingerie. And while you’re at it, you’ll check if everything smells fresh. If it doesn’t, put it in a separate pile for washing.”

David’s cheeks flushed, but he didn’t argue. He walked over to the bed and began sorting through the delicate fabrics, his movements slow and deliberate. Emma watched him with a smirk, her eyes glinting with amusement.

David picked up the first piece of lingerie—a delicate lace slip—and hesitated. He glanced at Emma, who was lounging on her bed, scrolling through her phone with a contented smile. She didn’t seem to be paying him any attention, but he could feel her eyes flicking toward him every now and then, her smirk widening as she watched him squirm.

“Go on, David,” Emma said, her tone casual but with a hint of amusement. “Don’t be shy. Just give it a sniff.”

David’s cheeks burned, but he didn’t argue. He brought the fabric to his nose and inhaled gently. The scent was strong and unmistakably… not fresh. But there was something else too—something intimate and personal that made his heart race. He quickly set the slip aside in the “to wash” pile, his hands trembling slightly.

Emma laughed, her voice bright and carefree. “Good job, David. You passed the first test.”

David blinked, his confusion evident. “Test?”

Emma’s smirk widened, and she leaned forward, her tone playful. “I put today’s underwear on top of the pile to see if you’d notice. And you did! You’re better at this than I thought.”

David’s face turned an even deeper shade of red, and he glanced away, his voice barely above a whisper. “I… I just did what you asked.”

Emma’s laughter rang out again, and she tilted her head, her eyes glinting with mischief. “Oh, David, you’re so cute when you’re flustered. But you might want to… uh… calm down a little.”

David frowned, his confusion growing. “What do you mean?”

Emma gestured toward him, her smirk widening. “Let’s just say it’s pretty obvious you’re enjoying this a little too much.”

David’s eyes widened, and he glanced down, his heart sinking as he realized what she meant. He quickly turned away, his cheeks burning with embarrassment. “I… I didn’t mean to…”

Emma laughed again, her tone light and teasing. “Oh, don’t worry, David. It’s natural. But we’re going to have to do something about that. I can’t have you getting distracted while you’re working for me. Every distraction is a sign that you’re not focusing, and I need you at your best.”

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He wanted to disappear, to sink into the floor and never come back, but Emma’s laughter kept pulling him back to reality.

“Don’t worry,” Emma said, her tone casual but with a hint of expectation. “We’ll figure something out. But for now, just keep going. And try to… uh… keep it together, okay?”

David nodded again, his voice quiet. “Okay.”

David continued sorting through the lingerie, his movements slow and deliberate. He picked up each piece, his hands trembling slightly as he brought it to his nose. The scents were overwhelming—some fresh and floral, others musky and intimate—and each one sent a shiver down his spine. He tried to focus, to push down the feelings bubbling inside him, but it was no use.

Emma watched him with a smirk, her eyes sparkling with amusement. “You’re doing great, David. Just a few more to go.”

David nodded silently, his cheeks still burning. He set aside another piece in the “to wash” pile, his mind swirling with unspoken thoughts. He wanted to feel proud of his efforts, to believe that he was doing the right thing, but the weight of the situation—and the lingering embarrassment—made it hard to relax.

As David finished sorting the lingerie, Emma clapped her hands together, her smile bright and cheerful. “Great job, David! Now, there’s just one more thing…”

David’s heart sank, but he didn’t argue. “What now?”

Emma’s smile widened, and she leaned forward, her tone teasing. “You’re going to hand-wash them. And you’ll be very, very careful. Delicate fabrics require delicate handling.”

David carried the pile of lingerie to the bathroom, his shoulders slumped and his cheeks still flushed. He set the delicate fabrics on the edge of the sink and stared at them for a moment, his mind racing. The soft lace and silk felt foreign in his hands, and the intimacy of the task made his stomach churn. But he didn’t argue. He never did.

He filled the sink with lukewarm water, adding a small amount of delicate detergent, and watched as the bubbles formed on the surface. The faint scent of lavender filled the air, but it did little to calm his nerves. He picked up the first piece—a lace bra—and gently submerged it in the water, his fingers carefully working the fabric to remove any dirt or odor.

As he worked, his mind wandered. He thought about Emma, about the way she had manipulated him into this situation, and about the way she and John had made decisions about his time without even asking him. *“You’ll go in the afternoon, and that’s final,”* she had said, as if his own needs and responsibilities didn’t matter. The memory of her tone—sharp and dismissive—made his chest tighten with frustration.

But then he thought about the other side of Emma—the side that sometimes made him feel like he mattered. The way she smiled at him when he did something right, the way she ruffled his hair or patted his arm when she was in a good mood. Those moments were rare, but they were enough to keep him coming back, enough to make him want to please her. He hated how much he craved her approval, but he couldn’t help it. When she was kind to him, even for a moment, it felt like everything else didn’t matter.

He picked up another piece—a silk slip—and gently swirled it in the water, his fingers tracing the delicate seams. His hands were already starting to prune, and his back ached from leaning over the sink, but he didn’t stop. He couldn’t. Emma had asked him to do this, and no matter how uncomfortable or unfair it felt, he couldn’t bring himself to say no.

His thoughts drifted to John, and his frustration grew. John, who had barely lifted a finger all afternoon while David worked himself to exhaustion. John, who had the nerve to call him “kid” and slap him on the back like he was some kind of joke. And now, John and Emma had decided his schedule for him, as if he were a child who couldn’t make his own decisions. The thought made his jaw tighten, but he pushed it down, focusing on the task at hand.

He rinsed the slip carefully, making sure all the soap was out, and laid it on a clean towel to dry. The water was starting to cool, but he didn’t bother refilling it. He just kept working, his movements slow and deliberate, his mind a whirlwind of conflicting emotions.

When he was done, he carefully rinsed each piece and laid them out on the towel, arranging them neatly so they wouldn’t wrinkle. His hands were raw, and his back ached from leaning over the sink, but he didn’t complain. Instead, he stood there for a moment, staring at the pile of clean lingerie, and let out a quiet sigh.

Emma was already in bed, her phone in hand and a contented smile on her face. She looked up as David walked in, her tone casual but with a hint of amusement. “All done?”

David nodded silently, his voice quiet. “Yeah. Everything’s washed and drying.”

Emma’s smile widened, and she reached out, patting him on the arm. “You did a good job, David. I’m impressed. You took your time, and it shows. You can definitely do this more often now that I know you’re so good at it.”

David forced a weak smile, though his heart wasn’t in it. “Thanks, Emma.”

Emma leaned back against her pillows, her tone casual but with a hint of expectation. “You’re such a good helper, David. I don’t know what I’d do without you. Seriously, you make everything so much easier for me.”

David nodded silently, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He wanted to feel proud of her praise, but the weight of the day—and the lingering anxiety about tomorrow—made it hard to relax.

Emma’s expression shifted, her tone growing firmer. “Now, don’t forget—you’re helping John tomorrow afternoon. And I expect you to be at your best. No excuses, no mistakes. John needs you, and I want him to be *very* happy with the helper I’ve provided. Do you understand?”

David hesitated, his voice quiet. “Emma, I… I really need to study. I’ve got so much work to do, and—”

Emma cut him off with a sharp wave of her hand, her eyes narrowing as she leaned forward. “David, listen to me. John is counting on you, and I’ve already told him how reliable you are. I won’t have you making me look bad. You’ll be there, and you’ll work harder than you’ve ever worked before. Do you understand?”

Her tone was sharp and commanding, and she pointed a finger at him, her gaze piercing. David flinched slightly, his shoulders slumping further. “Yes, Emma. I understand.”

Emma’s smile returned, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Good. I’m glad we’re on the same page. John’s satisfaction is important to me, and I want him to know that I’ve provided him with the best helper possible. So, no mistakes tomorrow. None. Understood?”

David nodded silently, his voice barely above a whisper. “Understood.”

Emma leaned back again, her tone casual but with a hint of finality. “Good. Now, before you go to bed, there’s one more thing.”

David hesitated, his heart sinking. “What?”

Emma’s smile widened, and she tilted her head, her tone sweet but with a hint of expectation. “You should thank me for arranging all of this for you. I’ve gone out of my way to make sure you have opportunities to prove yourself, and I think a little gratitude is in order.”

David stared at her, his mind swirling with conflicting emotions. He wanted to argue, to tell her that he hadn’t asked for any of this, but the look in her eyes—sharp and expectant—made it impossible to say no. Instead, he nodded silently, his voice quiet. “Thank you, Emma. For… for arranging everything.”

Emma’s smile widened, and she reached out, patting him on the arm again. “You’re welcome, David. Now, get some rest. You’ve got a big day tomorrow.”

David nodded silently and walked out of the room, his shoulders slumped and his eyes downcast. He made his way to his own room, the weight of the day pressing heavily on him. As he lay down in bed, his mind swirled with unspoken thoughts.",5,1742739849.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

I want to get to know her and make sure she feels comfortable in our house, along with getting a few things for just her. Trying to be a good employer!

Would it be weird to have her fill out a questionnaire with some of her favorite snacks, her favorite color, favorite drink from coffee shops, etc? I was thinking of getting her a travel coffee mug for our house (but want to know her favorite color) and making sure we have some snack things available that she would like. I know some of this will come out once she starts working, but a first day welcome gift might be nice.

I'm a dedicated player and a digital artist, looking to extend my passion for the game into creating fan-based content like T-shirts, coffee mugs, and more. I'm considering selling these items through my Etsy shop and would love to share my artwork with the community. However, I'm a bit uncertain about the guidelines surrounding this.

From what I've observed, there's a variety of Fortnite-related content on Etsy, yet I'm trying to understand how this aligns with Epic Games' Fan Content Policy. Specifically, I'm concerned about this section of the policy:

1.4 Fan Content must not pursue any commercial (monetary) objectives. However, an exception is made for individual fans who may monetize web videos (like those on YouTube) with ads, provided these videos adhere to the policy’s other requirements.

Could anyone clarify if creating and selling such merchandise on Etsy is permissible under this policy? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1,1742739538.0,FortniteFanArt,0,1.0,False

I came back to DC for the first time in ages and I see these gross Tattes all over the place. 

I mistakenly thought it was French (didn't realize it was junk from Israel)...so I assumed they would have European style baked goods and sugar cookies. I grew up in the UK and this French bakery used to hand out sugar cookies to us while we walked to school each morning. So it's a nostalgic thing for me. American sugar cookies taste like flour mixed with cardboard in comparison....and that's exactly how the Tatte cookies tasted too. 

Who the hell is buying this stuff??? I got the chocolate loaf cake thing and it was literally inedible. Actually DISGUSTING. 

I think this might be the worst ""bakery"" I've ever gone to. And there are some good bakeries in DC...but this is not one of them. I think the non-chain bakeries (with fresh baked items) are superior ",0,1742739332.0,washingtondc,37,0.37,False

*""Fucking right I am,""* I muttered, leaning back in my worn office chair.

Every day was slow at this office. My boss didn't give a shit, and frankly, neither did I. Most of the time, I wasn't even entirely sure what my job was. Officially, I was a data entry clerk. In reality, I had maybe two hours of actual work per day, leaving me another six to stare at my screen, fiddle with my phone, or zone out into existential dread.

I clicked on the email, scanning through it skeptically. It read:

*""Are you dissatisfied with your life? Do you need more structure? We can help! Visit our site and sign up today!""*

*""Obvious scam,""* I chuckled to myself. But boredom is a powerful motivator, and, a virus might've given me something interesting to deal with. I activated my antivirus software, fired up my VPN, and clicked the provided link.

The webpage was stark white with bold, black letters at the top:

*""8.5 Rules to Survive the Supernatural (and Other Strange Occurrences).""*

Below it was a simple question: *""Do you accept?""* with options for yes or no.

I hesitated briefly, grinning. A rock was probably more superstitious or spiritual than I'd ever been. Ghosts, demons, supernatural rules, none of that was real to me. Still, I had literally nothing better to do, so I clicked yes.

A large *""Thank You""* flashed across the screen.

I laughed quietly, shaking my head as I logged off and stretched. *""Good time for coffee,""* I whispered to myself.

I headed into our break room, the stale odor of crackers and burnt coffee welcoming me as usual. The sound of the coffee machine droned on, accompanied by faint coughing and the occasional sniffle from coworkers whose names I barely knew. The break room was possibly the most depressing place in the building, which was saying something.

*""Jamie! My man, what's up dog?""* came Patrick's voice, shattering my fragile sense of peace. I cringed internally. If small talk was torture, small talk with Patrick was like being waterboarded. Patrick, blissfully unaware of this, considered us friends.

He also had an uncomfortable habit of watching porn right there in his cubicle during work hours, something our boss conveniently overlooked. Once, I'd been on a customer call when Patrick’s cubicle echoed with unmistakable *""satisfaction sounds.""* The customer, understandably, had been deeply confused, and I'd wanted nothing more than for the ground to open up and swallow me whole.

Patrick immediately launched into some irrelevant story, gesturing emphatically with his hands. *""Uh-huh,""* I said occasionally, *""Wow, that's cool,""* while completely zoning out.

My coffee finally finished brewing. I poured myself a cup, added cream and sugar, and began stirring absentmindedly. Lifting the cup to my lips, I froze mid-motion.

Behind Patrick, beyond his wildly flailing arms, something caught my eye.

A ghostly, pale hand curled around the break room doorway, fingers twitching erratically. My heart lurched, but I forced a smile. It had to be some prank, an attempt to inject some life into this monotonous hellscape. A head followed the hand, then a torso, then legs. A woman staggered into the room, somewhere in her mid-thirties, though decay made age difficult to determine. Her skin was blotchy, pale and rotting, patches sloughing away like old wallpaper. The sickly-sweet scent of decomposition mingled unsettlingly with fresh coffee. She wore a familiar green apron with a nametag pinned crookedly to it reading *""Hi! My name is Shannon.""*

Grinning even wider, I watched her approach, waiting for a coworker to acknowledge the absurdity of the moment, but nobody looked up. Not even Patrick, despite her passing close enough to him.

She stumbled directly toward me, eyes cloudy yet focused. Stopping inches away, she reached out, snatched my coffee cup, and pretended to pour something invisible into it, her bony fingers shaking slightly. She handed it back with a grotesque, toothy smile before stumbling away out of sight.

I chuckled nervously, glancing around. Still, no one reacted. The hairs on my arms prickled with unease. Something felt off now, the prank growing less amusing by the second. Patrick stared at me, irritation and confusion etched onto his face.

*""Bro, are you deaf or something?""* he demanded.

I blinked *""What?""* I startled.

*""I've been trying to get your attention for the past five minutes. You've been standing there staring off into space.""*

*""Seriously?""* I said, trying to laugh it off. Patrick didn't budge.

*""Yeah, man, seriously. Are you feeling okay?""*

*""Oh yeah, just…just tired,""* I lied, forcing another laugh. Patrick gave a dubious grunt and turned away, shaking his head.

I looked down at the cup of coffee Shannon had *""prepared""* for me. It looked normal and smelled normal, yet something tugged at the back of my mind, screaming at me to put it down. Still, out of sheer awkwardness and defiance, I took a sip.

Immediately, I spat the liquid out, narrowly missing Patrick, who jumped back in disgust.

*""Dude! What the hell?""* he snapped, backing away toward the door. *""Something's seriously wrong with you today.""*

Ignoring him, I stared at the cup. It had the texture of motor oil and the acrid, medicinal taste of DayQuil. Stomach turning, I slammed the cup onto the counter and hurried back to my cubicle, coworkers glancing up from their screens to follow me with curious eyes.

My hands trembled slightly as I logged back onto my computer. There, at the top of my inbox, was another new email, sender unknown.

Its subject line read simply:

**Rule Number 1: Never stir your coffee counterclockwise.**

Over the next week, I adjusted my routine to accommodate Rule Number 1.

At first, I slipped up out of sheer habit, sleepily stirring counterclockwise without even thinking. Each mistake summoned Shannon, the ghostly barista, creeping silently from dark corners, stumbling awkwardly into my kitchen. She’d mutter unintelligibly while pouring imaginary ingredients into my coffee, turning it into something thick, vile, and medicinal in taste.

The first couple of times, it was horrifying. By Thursday, I just sighed and dumped the corrupted coffee down the sink.

How do you even wrap your brain around something like this? I initially blamed hallucinations or some twisted prank by Patrick and the others at work. Maybe they slipped something into my food to mess with me, I wouldn’t put it past them. But deep down, I knew this wasn’t ordinary; this was something I couldn’t logically explain away.

It was disturbing, but by Friday, I was an expert at stirring clockwise.

That Sunday evening, as I lay on my couch, dreading another week of pointless drudgery, my phone vibrated. It was another email from the mysterious sender. I opened it, my pulse quickening slightly.

**Rule 2: Do not watch horror movies after midnight without covering your feet.**

I stared at it skeptically, almost laughing. Another silly superstition, another seemingly harmless rule. Feeling a bit defiant, I glanced at the clock, 11:23 PM, and decided to test it out, throwing caution to the wind. I turned on my favorite movie, *John Carpenter’s The Thing,* purposely kicking the blanket away from my feet as the movie began.

The clock rolled past midnight without me even noticing; I was engrossed, right up until the scene where Bennings was caught mid-transformation. A sudden icy tickle crawled up my feet, like tiny frozen fingers lightly brushing against my skin. Quickly, I reached for the blanket, but it was like my body had become encased in invisible ice. Panic surged through me as the sensation climbed my calves, then thighs, immobilizing me in an escalating wave of numbing dread.

Desperately, I managed to shut off the TV. The instant the screen went dark, warmth flooded back into my legs, the ice-cold paralysis evaporating as if it had never happened. I sat there panting, heart hammering, realizing sleep would be elusive tonight.

The next day at work was rough. Sleep deprivation gnawed at my sanity, and I tried to find some logical explanation. Searching my email archives and forums yielded nothing. It was as if the original emails never existed, wiped clean from reality, leaving only my handwritten notes as proof.

My sense of reality began leaking from my mind like water dripping from a faucet left open. Still, despite the terror, I had to admit: my life had become significantly less mundane.

Friday afternoon finally arrived, bringing with it the promise of two days free from monotonous work and Patrick's unfiltered commentary. Just as I was packing up, another email pinged on my phone:

**Rule 3: Avoid taking out the trash during a full moon.**

I stared at my screen and whispered the rule aloud, immediately looking up the next full moon, exactly two weeks from today. I jotted it down in a notebook, determined to respect this one. Yet, as the days passed, my curiosity and boredom overtook caution, and when the full moon arrived, I found myself carelessly carrying the trash toward the apartment's compactor, the moonlight bright and almost hypnotizing.

Staring up at the glowing lunar orb made my problems feel insignificant. That tranquil moment was shattered by a honking car snapping me back to reality. Embarrassed, I waved awkwardly and tossed my garbage into the compactor, dramatically wiping my hands clean. I lingered, waiting for something supernatural, something horrifying.

Thirty uneventful minutes later, disappointment weighed on me. I began to turn back toward home when a scurrying shadow caught my attention, a small rat darting toward the compactor.

I followed cautiously, shining my flashlight into the dark compartment, catching the rodent greedily nibbling trash. It turned, hissed sharply at the sudden beam of light, and disappeared deeper inside. Shrugging it off, I headed home, disappointed but relieved nothing worse had happened.

That relief lasted mere days.

The next time I took out the trash, opening the compactor door revealed something straight from a nightmare. My breath caught in my throat, and the bag slipped from my grasp.

The rat had grown to the size of a large dog, it turned to face me, its black eyes reflecting the weak streetlamp. Drool dripped from its enormous incisors, and a low, predatory hiss erupted from deep within its throat.

I slammed the compactor shut, heart pounding in terror. Before I could even step away, a thunderous bang echoed from within, the rat-beast throwing itself violently against the metal door. It knew I was there, and it was hungry.

I sprinted back to my apartment, locking the door behind me and sinking to the floor, mind racing with questions.

In the following days, reports trickled in: pets gone missing, neighbors whispering anxiously about sightings of an enormous creature lurking at night. Eventually, missing pet flyers gave way to missing person reports.

A new urban legend took root, locals spoke in hushed voices about a giant, monstrous rat that prowled the area under the full moon, snatching away anyone foolish enough to wander outside alone. Each new disappearance stoked my guilt, gnawed at my conscience. I'd unleashed this horror simply out of boredom and negligence. It was my fault, my careless disrespect of the rules had endangered innocent people.

Yet, over the weeks that followed, the disappearances stopped. The creature seemed to vanish as mysteriously as it had appeared.

During this time, a deep and gnawing guilt settled into my bones.

The monstrous rat was my responsibility. Those missing pets, the frightened whispers around the neighborhood, all traced back to me. I'd spent my entire life bored and careless, unaware that my selfishness could hurt others. Now that it had, it forced me to reevaluate everything.

I resolved to treat these rules with newfound respect, aware now of how casually I'd neglected the consequences, not just for myself but for everyone else around me. There were still 5.5 more rules ahead, and what the "".5"" meant at the time, I had absolutely no clue.

One evening, while spinning idly in my desk chair at home, lost in thought about what I'd done and how I could be better, my eyes fell on something unusual perched atop my bookshelf. It was a porcelain Neko cat statue, the kind you'd see waving from the counter of an old family-run Chinese restaurant. Only, I knew I'd never owned one before. It was aged, chipped around its paws, the paint faded and worn. Its eyes weren't just closed, they were squeezed shut, forcefully sealed.

I stopped spinning, staring intently at it for a full minute, almost daring it to move.

My phone buzzed. It was the familiar ding of an email notification, and I felt my pulse quicken as I picked it up. The screen read, simply:

**Rule 4: Always pet the cat when her eyes are open.**

My eyes snapped back to the statue, relief washing over me when I saw its eyes still tightly shut. A shiver ran down my spine at the thought of meeting whatever gaze hid beneath those lids. I considered tossing the statue immediately, throwing it in the dumpster and washing my hands of whatever horrors awaited. But flashes of the rat creature and those cold, dark eyes haunted me. These rules were no joke.

Reluctantly, I noted Rule 4 in my growing notebook of precautions.

The following day, I had a few friends over. It was supposed to be a break from the insanity I'd been dealing with, a relaxing night of ""beerio-kart,"" combining cheap beer with classic Mario Kart. Just as I stood up, wobbling slightly from the alcohol, laughter echoing behind me, something across the room drew my attention. My stomach dropped.

The cat statue's eyes were wide open, unnaturally bright, fixated directly on me. Its porcelain head had turned slightly, matching my stare.

The laughter behind me dulled into silence as my friends noticed I'd gone rigid.

“You, uh—you good, dude?” Zack slurred, his voice slightly concerned beneath the haze of alcohol.

I nodded stiffly, forcing a weak smile. Both Zack and James were now silent, watching me cautiously. Slowly, feeling ridiculous, I walked across the room to the statue and placed a trembling hand atop its head. My fingers brushed against its cold surface, and mercifully, the eyes gradually closed again, the head shifting gently back into its original position.

I turned awkwardly, catching the confused looks of my friends.

Zack burst out laughing. “Bro, how drunk are you?”

James joined in, beer spraying from his mouth. “Seriously, dude, are you okay? You need to get out more.”

I forced out a laugh, masking my dread and embarrassment, eyes still darting suspiciously to the statue, which thankfully remained still.

Over the next few days, I meticulously checked the statue, ensuring its eyes stayed shut. In fact, the encounter with the statue kickstarted changes I hadn't anticipated. I found myself distancing from coffee altogether, switching to tea to minimize any supernatural incidents. My nightly routine shifted as well; no more late-night TV binges, just early reading and restful sleep. I even began composting, desperately trying to avoid another disastrous incident involving the trash compactor.

These rules, terrifying as they were, had inadvertently pushed me toward becoming a better person.

However, old habits were hard to shake.

One morning, running late and stressed, I raced out the door without checking the cat statue. Traffic was hellish, cars inching forward in frustratingly tiny increments. Anxiety pulsed in my temples as I kept glancing at the clock, the red numbers taunting my lateness.

A strange sensation prickled at the back of my neck, warm, damp-breath like someone was right behind me. I whipped my head around. Nothing.

I turned off the radio, blaming it for the muffled whispers I swore I was hearing, but silence only heightened the sensation. Paranoia began seeping in, a thick fog clouding my rational mind. Had the cat's eyes been open when I left? Had I been careless again?

Just as traffic began moving again and I tried calming my breath, a small figure darted in front of my car. There was a sickening thud and a horrifying screech of tires. Brakes squealed, and honks echoed as vehicles swerved around me.

Heart hammering, I stumbled out to the front of my car. There, sprawled motionless on the asphalt, was the body of a small girl, no older than ten.

My blood ran cold. Panic gripped my chest as I kneeled beside her, gently turning her over.

I recoiled, stumbling back in horror.

Her face, it wasn’t human. Wide, glassy feline eyes stared up at me, her features grotesquely distorted into something cat-like, with sharp teeth protruding from her open mouth. The creature slowly began to rise, limbs jerking unnaturally, its gaze locked onto mine as a sinister, toothy grin spread across its face.

Adrenaline took over. I sprinted back to my car, slamming the door shut and speeding away recklessly. Glancing in my rearview mirror, the cat-girl stood motionless, her hand slowly waving as if to say goodbye.

My breathing was ragged, heart hammering violently in my chest as the image of her twisted, smiling face burned itself into my memory.

When I got to the office, I rushed to my cubicle, panting like a dog and feeling completely disoriented. The events of that morning kept replaying in my mind like a horror reel on loop.

As I moved through the dimly lit aisles, I swore I saw silhouettes darting between desks, dark, menacing shapes lingering at the corners of my vision, but I refused to look directly. My heart hammered in my chest, each step closer to my cubicle feeling like a step deeper into a nightmare.

Finally, reaching my tiny workspace, I collapsed into my chair and tucked my head into the corner, shutting my eyes tightly. For a moment there was silence, but then sounds emerged around me, strange, shuffling movements, whispers blended grotesquely with cat-like mewls, inching closer to my ears.

Panic surged through me. My body broke into a cold sweat, drops sliding down my temples and splashing onto the desk.

“Please stop,” I muttered weakly, gripping the desk so hard my knuckles turned white.

The cubicle door swung open suddenly, and I spun around, almost jumping out of my skin. It was Patrick, who looked even more frightened than I felt.

“Hey, dude—I've been knocking for like five minutes,” he said nervously. His eyes widened in confusion and mild horror. “Whoa... haha, funny prank, man. Very creepy.”

“What the hell are you talking about, Patrick? I'm not pulling any pranks!” I snapped, wiping sweat off my forehead.

“Uh, right, totally.” Patrick gestured nervously at his own face, circling his eyes. “Cool contacts or whatever.” He backed away awkwardly, shooting anxious glances over his shoulder as he went.

Confused, I quickly touched my face, feeling for anything unusual, but found nothing. Anxiety growing, I stumbled toward the restroom. On the way, heads peered curiously from behind partitions, whispering voices drifting away whenever I looked.

The restroom lights buzzed softly as I rushed to the mirror. My eyes had changed; the pupils were slit, elongated vertically like a cat’s, piercingly unnatural. I staggered backward, holding my breath to stop a scream that threatened to rip out of me.

“No, no, no!” I scrambled out of the bathroom, bolting toward the parking lot, feeling dozens of invisible eyes burning into my back. As I drove home, shadows stretched and twisted alongside the road, dark figures slipping through the trees, watching my every movement.

At my apartment, my hands trembled violently as I unlocked the door. The cat statue awaited me inside, its head now turned directly toward the entrance, its eyes still shut, but its posture radiating hostility. Instead of its usual beckoning pose, it was hunched, hissing silently, ready to leap.

Turning away for just a split second to hang up my keys, I spun back around to see its eyes suddenly wide open, two hollow, black voids staring into me. My pulse roared in my ears. Shaking uncontrollably, I approached it, cautiously reaching out to pet the statue’s head.

The moment my fingertips brushed against its cold ceramic surface, a sharp, agonizing pain exploded in my eyes, as though needles stabbed deep into them, twisting viciously. I collapsed, writhing and screaming in anguish, hands clutching at my face, feeling invisible claws gripping and tearing at my eyeballs. Then, just as suddenly as it began, the pain vanished.

Breathless and terrified, I blinked rapidly, vision clearing. The statue was back in its usual position, eyes closed peacefully. Racing to the bathroom, my reflection now showed my own eyes, the horror erased like it never happened.

A hysterical, relieved laugh escaped my lips. I shakily texted my boss, ""Went home sick. Taking a few days off.""

The next morning, another dreaded notification pinged my phone awake. My heart sank slightly, anticipating more torment, but I quickly opened the email:

**Rule 5: Always leave exactly one light on when you leave your home.**

I exhaled slowly, wrote the rule down carefully, and committed it to memory. The rules were escalating, and the consequences of ignoring them were more severe each time. It was clear I couldn’t afford mistakes any longer.

I spent the following days organizing my apartment, cleaning meticulously as paranormal podcasts murmured softly in the background. Ironically, I'd never been superstitious, often dismissing stories of ghosts and demons as attention-seeking nonsense. But given my recent experiences, I wanted to know more, understand the unexplainable.

Eventually, another email arrived:

**Rule 6: Always greet animals you encounter with a nod or a polite word.**

I chuckled out loud upon reading this, picturing how absurd I'd look greeting every stray animal. But my amusement didn't last long.

It started with squirrels and birds. I'd be strolling along, lost in thought, when a squirrel on a nearby fence would suddenly freeze mid-chew, its tiny head pivoting toward me in unnatural slow motion, eyes as black as polished stones. The birds too would halt their flight, frozen mid-air as if someone had pressed pause, until I greeted them. Only then would they resume their lives, the birds chirping merrily, squirrels scampering away like normal creatures.

Even people’s pets acted oddly. Once, a golden retriever on its daily walk stopped and rotated its head mechanically, staring me down with eyes so dark they seemed bottomless.

""Good… good afternoon,"" I said awkwardly, causing its tail to wag enthusiastically again.

The dog's owner laughed, a pretty woman around my age. ""He likes you!"" she smiled warmly.

We struck up a conversation that flowed effortlessly, and before I knew it, I had her number saved as April.

This strange set of rules, which had once terrified me, began shaping my life into something better. My apartment was cleaner, my sleep deeper, and now even my social life was improving. For the first time in years, boredom was losing its grip on me. But just as I thought I'd found some stability, another email arrived, plunging my heart into ice-cold dread.

**Rule 7: Avoid eye contact with any reflection during a power outage.**

I stared at my screen, feeling anxiety rise like bile in my throat. A shiver ran down my spine, dread pooling in my gut. Something felt deeply wrong.

I packed up quickly, eager to get home and assess the situation. But as soon as I opened my door, my stomach sank: the power was out. The darkness pressed heavily against my eyes, the shadows thicker than usual.

I cursed silently. How long had the power been off? I'd broken rule number five, the one about always leaving a single light on. I turned on my phone flashlight, revealing chaos: dishes piled in the sink, crumbs scattered across counters, furniture shifted unnaturally, the lucky neko cat statue toppled on its side, glaring at the wall.

Moving quickly, I headed for my closet to retrieve a battery-powered lamp. I reminded myself repeatedly not to look at the mirror, walking carefully past the bathroom, my eyes fixed firmly ahead. Then, just as I grabbed the lamp, I heard it, a soft, eerie whisper that sounded disturbingly familiar.

“Jamie...Jamie, over here,” said the voice.

It was a child's voice. My voice, from when I was young, but twisted with malicious intent. My heart raced, sweat pricking at the back of my neck.

“Come on, Jamie, we have so much to talk about!” it continued, tapping against the bathroom mirror as if it were a window.

I shut my eyes, took a shaky breath, and exited my bathroom.

I placed the lamp on the kitchen counter, its pale glow barely penetrating the darkness. I reached for my phone, desperate for the comfort of something familiar, but froze when another voice, a darker, colder one, interrupted me.

“Well, you're a fucking disappointment.”

The voice was deep, dripping with venom. My heart seized, my phone slipping from numb fingers and clattering to the floor, the screen cracking sharply against the tiles. In the dim glow of the battery-powered lamp, shadows stretched long and distorted across the kitchen walls.

Slowly, my eyes lifted toward the round mirror in the living room, drawn by a force I couldn’t resist. My reflection stared back, pale, hollow-eyed, terrified. Then, slowly, the mirrored face began to change. Its lips curled upward, stretching into an impossibly wide, hideous grin that seemed to split the cheeks unnaturally. The flesh around its left eye sagged downward, deforming into a misshapen oval, skin drooping and distorting like melted wax.

“Just look at what you've become,” it said cruely

I stood paralyzed, breath trapped in my throat, feeling cold sweat trace lines down my spine. My reflection continued to twist and deform, features morphing grotesquely, the mocking smile never fading. Without thinking, my hand rose shakily to my own face, fingers brushing over my skin, frantically ensuring everything was still where it belonged.

“You’re pathetic,” it sneered, voice dark and echoing. “You had every chance, Jamie, every fucking opportunity handed to you on a silver platter. And look at you, working to live, living to work, nothing but a hamster spinning in his little wheel.”

A sickening laugh escaped the mirror, thick and mocking, as its tongue lolled out unnaturally, forked and slack like a serpent’s. Every twisted syllable dripped venom. Somehow, deep in my chest, I found the strength to speak, though the words trembled and faltered like a frightened child’s.

“I... I h-h-have changed! I—I've… g-gotten better, I’ve been waking—”

The reflection instantly mocked me, my voice shifting to the high-pitched, spiteful taunt of a child—my child voice.

“S-s-stuttering again, Jamie? Can't get a fucking word out? Oh, you’ve changed alright—thanks to your precious RULES!” The last word thundered violently, echoing through my bones. “Pathetic! Can’t you think for yourself? Clearly not, huh? After you pissed away your grandparents’ inheritance on nothing, look at you now, stuttering again, scared of your own reflection!”

“W-what…who the hell are you?” I barely whispered, backing away slowly, legs shaking beneath me.

My twisted reflection rose, elongating horribly, its limbs stretching thin and spiderlike. It loomed, towering within the confines of the mirror.

“I’m you, Jamie,” it hissed, drawing each word out with sadistic delight. “All your sins, your regrets, your miserable fucking existence, all in one place. And I’m tired of being trapped here.”

Without warning, it rushed backward and slammed violently into the glass. The mirror cracked, splintering outward as the entire wall shuddered. I stumbled back, collapsing to the floor and scrambling frantically into a corner, helplessly watching as it backed up again, readying itself like a predator for another strike.

The reflection lunged once more, its distorted face a twisted mask of glee and rage, smashing into the mirror. The walls shook, and thin cracks spiderwebbed outward, nearly shattering the barrier between us. It backed away, panting with animalistic hunger.

“I—I'm s-sorry,” I stammered desperately, barely recognizing my own voice. “I’ve… I've been trying. I-I-I’ve been getting better!”

“Better?” it mocked viciously, leaning closer. Its voice softened again, whispering intimately, “You’re nothing without these rules, Jamie. They’re the only thing holding your worthless life together. Admit it.”

I curled backward, my back pressing painfully into the corner of the kitchen counter, arms wrapping protectively around my knees. My breathing became shallow, ragged gasps echoing in the claustrophobic darkness.

“Admit it!” the reflection screamed. It stepped back for another assault, teeth sharpening, arms growing impossibly long.

I wanted to run, to scream, to throw something at it, but fear held me in place. I could only watch helplessly as it charged forward again, its grotesque features contorting in anticipation.

At the very last moment, just as the mirror seemed poised to explode outward, the lights flickered back to life, blinding me momentarily.

My breath echoed loudly in my ears, and the words, my own twisted voice from the mirror, repeated like a dark mantra, each syllable carving deeper into my psyche. Everything it said, every accusation, every bitter truth was true. I had buried those parts of myself for years, and now they crawled beneath my skin.

I spent the next hour sinking deeper into darkness and despair, until eventually, I forced myself up, moving like a marionette with tangled strings.

I began to clean the apartment, trying to reclaim some sense of normalcy, but it felt different now. Something else was here. It lingered in the corners, in the soft creaks of doors opening and closing quietly. Footsteps whispered from the living room to the kitchen, pausing just long enough to send chills down my spine. Yet every time I rushed to investigate, nothing but emptiness greeted me.

Days became a blur of anxious adherence to the rules, waiting in fearful anticipation for what horror would appear next. A notification jolted me from my thoughts one evening, and my heart skipped a beat until I saw it was just a text message, from April. Relief washed over me, and I smiled as I read her invitation to dinner. Eager to escape the oppressive atmosphere of my home, I accepted and got ready quickly.

Before leaving, I glanced at the cat statue. Its eyes stared wide open, accusingly, impatiently.

“Needy little thing, aren’t you?” I chuckled uneasily, petting its cold, porcelain head. “Don’t wait up.”

Dinner with April was a breath of fresh air. Her laugh was genuine, her stories engaging, and as we talked, I felt a rare sense of connection. She’d recently been promoted to a manager at a grocery company and was temporarily traveling to train at a distant store. The evening passed quickly, leaving us both eager for another meeting. As she drove away, I practically skipped to my car, the weight of recent horrors momentarily lifted.

Back home, comfortable in bed with Carl Sagan’s Cosmos illuminating softly on my Kindle, my phone buzzed. Anticipating a message from April, my grin faded as I recognized the familiar email notification instead. Dread surged as I opened it slowly, preparing my notebook with trembling fingers.

**Rule 8: Avoid looking out of windows after hearing an unknown animal sound.**

Almost immediately, an unnatural wailing pierced the stillness outside, an anguished blend of a deer’s scream and the growl of a mountain lion. It started distant but grew louder, angrier, moving closer. Suddenly, something heavy slammed into the outside wall, scraping frantically at the windowpane. The blinds rattled, my heart pounding painfully in my chest.

I froze under my covers, a terrified child once again. The wailing mutated, struggling to form words:

“Le—Ah—Let m-me—IN!”

Each word was strained, desperate. My breath came in shallow, rapid gasps as the voice began to change, becoming softer, disturbingly familiar.

“Jamie,” it purred sweetly, now eerily like April’s voice, “I had such a great time tonight. Let me in, babe...it’s freezing out here.” On the word 'freezing,' its voice broke into a feral, guttural snarl.

I didn’t move an inch, clutching my covers tighter.

“Stay out there and freeze, you bitch,” I muttered softly, more bravado than bravery. Yet it continued, relentless, cycling through voices, my mother, my sister, close friends, each imitation more accurate, more heart-wrenching, until they became indistinguishable from reality.

But logic prevailed. I was on the fourth floor. There was no way my sixty-year-old mother or anyone else was perched on the windowsill outside. I clenched my eyes shut, enduring the nightmarish chorus until finally, mercifully, dawn began to creep through the edges of the blinds. A silhouette lingered briefly, blocking the sunrise, then dissolved slowly, fading into nothing.

I released a shaky breath, finally rising to start the day.

For months, no more rules arrived. Life took on a strange new rhythm. Oddly, these terrifying rules brought structure and even growth to my life. I broke Rule 7 intentionally once, staring into a mirror during another power outage, confronting my demons face-to-face, turning my fears into tools for self-improvement. I bought noise-canceling earplugs to silence whatever mimicked voices outside my window at night. Even Rule 5, though its consequences remained obscure, seemed manageable despite the random noises and occasional shadows drifting through my apartment. Perhaps I had simply gained a quiet roommate.

April left town for her training, and gradually our texts slowed to silence. Maybe she found someone new or just lost interest, whatever the reason, I accepted it, feeling more equipped to handle disappointment than ever before.

One evening, returning home from work, an envelope waited jammed into my door. I hesitated before opening it, already feeling dread pooling in my gut. Inside, a single note read:

**Rule 8.5: And whatever you do, never, ever…**

The half-rule settled in my mind like a persistent itch, slowly eroding my sanity. Paranoia became my shadow; it followed me everywhere, whispering uncertainties into my ears. For months afterward, I'd glance nervously over my shoulder, convinced I’d heard someone softly call my name when no one was around. Each time, I was greeted by empty air and silence so deep it felt unnatural.

When I walked through the park, everyone’s shadows seemed off, subtly distorted or moving at different speeds from their owners, mocking me while everyone else moved on obliviously. I would stop abruptly, staring at my own shadow, swearing it twitched or shifted, daring me to challenge its reality.

I started doubting myself again. Maybe Patrick and my coworkers had been dosing me all along, orchestrating some sick, elaborate prank. Maybe I'd finally cracked from the stress. But even as I rationalized, my mind spun endlessly back to that unfinished rule, driving me mad with speculation.

Eventually, even this heightened state of fear grew dull, becoming just another mundane part of life. The routines formed by the rules became tedious again, color fading once more from my daily existence.

As I'm sitting at my desk typing this out, another notification pinged softly on my screen. My heartbeat quickened as I clicked open the email. Just two simple words:

**Bored again?**

A wide grin spread across my face.

Every morning, as the world awakens around me, I sit in stillness and let these questions rise like steam from my coffee cup. In these quiet hours, before the noise of the day takes over, I feel the pull of something vast and unknowable. The more I try to grasp it, the more it slips through my fingers.
