I don’t usually carry the tripod unless I’m on a specific photo mission which also means I don’t use the 10-stop ND very often. In summer, I’ll swap out the 1/8 with a 1/4 filter and ditch the lens hood. There’s a pair of latex gloves at the bottom of the sling for emergency use and a little water resistance on the bottom, plus a couple of wet wipes and napkins are stuffed in the pockets. I use the heroclip to carry my coffee cup, water bottle or ball cap when necessary.

1gojaj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1gojaj6/the_pier/,The Pier,"I hope on your sick Sunday this helps you enjoy some tiny bit of escape. I enjoyed reading your stuff so much; here’s my thank you.

————- 

Navigating her boat into the secluded cove at night wasn’t easy. There was almost no light. She moved quietly, her silhouette softened by the moonlight and the misty, warm night air. The tropical heat enveloped her, and her clothes clung to her damp skin as she stood at the helm. Her dark eyes scanned the dim, moonlit bay, and she noticed the sparsely lit, modest pier. A few other boats were tied up, swaying gently in the calm water. 

“There it was,” she thought, just as the local had described it. Her Spanish wasn’t very good, so she worried she hadn’t understood the directions. But there it was: a pier with four rusty old street lights, each with a different colored bulb—red, purple, green, and blue—and a driftwood sign that said, “Shore Thing,” with an arrow pointing toward land.

She eased the throttle, guiding the boat toward the dock. Every sound was amplified in the quiet—the low hum of the engine, the gentle lapping of water, the soft creak of wood from the pier ahead. Once close, she cut the engine, stepped to the side of the boat, and hopped onto the pier. The soft thud of fenders meeting the dock buoys echoed briefly in the stillness. She did her best to tie up her boat, but she was tired, and her fingers fumbled with the knots as she secured the lines.

She walked down the pier toward the beach, her dark eyes reflecting the shimmer of the overhead multicolored bulbs in rusted street lamps lining the pier. The wet warmth of the night air consumed her as the island's scents surrounded her. She reached the end of the dock and stepped onto the beach. Something felt special about this place. It was as if time slowed down, and the island held its breath with her as she absorbed the quiet beauty of it all. She took a deep breath and exhaled.

The bar, “Shore Thing,” was isolated and just a few hundred yards away. She watched as the colored lights danced in the distance. It was a quirky, open-air beach bar set at the edge of the sand under a canopy of swaying palm trees and stars. Multicolored lights were strung haphazardly across the bar and nearby trees, casting vibrant shades of pink, blue, and green that seemed to dance across the sand in rhythm with the lo-fi beats she heard as she approached. ""The Girl From Ipanema"" was playing, and she smiled to herself, thinking, “This *is* perfect.” She considered, just for a moment, how lucky she was to be living this life.

The sand under her feet was littered with seashells, the occasional broken piece of beach decor, or leftover beer bottle. As she walked up to the bar, she admired the handmade decor that filled the space—wine bottle lamps glowing with warm, soft light, seashell garlands jingling gently in the breeze, and driftwood signs hand-painted with playful messages like “High Tides, Good Vibes.” Above her, chandeliers made from coral and driftwood swayed gently, casting wild, zebra-like shadows across the floor. The tabletops were mosaics of brightly colored bottle caps and old CDs arranged in odd nonsensical patterns. Overhead, old fishing nets flooded with deep indigo fairy lights and glass buoys gave it a whimsical seaside feel. Glass-bead chimes clinked softly in the breeze. Mason jars filled with small shells held candles that flickered warmly on the few seaside tables and around the U-shaped bar. The place felt like an extension of the beach itself, created from its very essence. She loved all of it.

The round, sun-kissed local bartender stood behind the bar and greeted her with a wide, warm smile. Her dress was as colorful as the surroundings. Instantly, she knew this bartender was part of the reason people traveled here.

""¿Abierto?"" she asked as she walked up.

The bartender replied in perfect English, “Honey, if I’m here, we’re open,” and winked at her.

This bartender was the only employee of “Shore Thing,” running the place entirely herself, making tropical drinks and creating daily dishes from whatever fresh-caught seafood and plants she’d collected earlier that day. Tonight, the air carried the rich aroma of grilled fish and the faint sweetness of coconut. The crowd was small, less than ten people—mostly locals - and maybe another traveler lucky enough to stumble across the place. She had come looking for this place. It was an amazing spot to dine, and the cove was perfect for finding sea glass. Locals have the best suggestions, but they’re often leery of new faces, so you have to build friendships before they reveal their hidden gems. This recommendation did not disappoint.

She tossed her brown hair up into a bun and grabbed a seat at the front of the U-shaped bar with her back to the ocean. It occurred to her that the bar was constructed this way so the bartender could keep an eye on the sea and pier. Relieved the bartender spoke English, she asked if food was still available. It was. There was no menu, just whatever the bartender made that day—just the way she liked it. She didn’t care for choices and found the best food was often created like this. The mingling scents of salt, rum, and sizzling herbs filled her senses, making her stomach growl. This meal was going to be amazing.

Surveying the other customers, she noticed a couple kissing on some broken-down beach chairs behind her. The two were very intimate. She looked away in secondhand embarrassment and realized she’d probably stared too long, but they didn’t seem to care. Two local men on the left side of the U-shaped bar smiled and nodded at her before returning to their deep, quiet conversation. Another couple dined outside, speaking half in whispers and half in loud voices, no in between. And there was a man sitting alone at the end of the right side of the bar, reading. Very Hemingway, she thought. He didn’t seem to notice anything other than his book. She couldn’t help but wonder what he was reading that would be more captivating than the escape this place provided.

A steaming plate was set in front of her with fried plantains, red beans and rice, and coconut-crusted fish. It smelled and looked delicious. She had traveled days for this. The bartender smiled and asked what she’d like to drink. She looked around, wanting to soak it all in. This is how she always decided what to drink—by whatever would make the moment better. She turned to the water, watched the waves lap up, and noticed the stars across the sky. She turned back to the bartender, smiled, and ordered a gin and tonic. 

The man at the end of the bar heard her and looked up from his book. They made eye contact. She couldn’t believe it. She knew him. They had worked together more than a decade before. “Cheers,” he said, smiling and lifting his glass with what seemed to be the same drink. She smiled back and immediately thought of the word that always reminded her of him: *mamihlapinatapai.* There’s no exact translation. But that’s what it was. Mamihlapinatapai.

Thrilled to see an old familiar face in a sea of unknowns, she jumped up, hurried over, and pulled out the seat next to him. She looked right into his piercing eyes, which she hadn’t seen for years, and remembered him well. “Hello, Mr. Crow, may I join you?” she asked, smiling.

He said, “That depends.”

For a second, she thought he was serious or had forgotten her, but then he flashed the smile she remembered. “Of course, but there’s someplace better.” He stood up, grabbed his book and gin and tonic, and suggested they move to a table by the water. He explained it was high tide but that he usually read at the tables outside for the quiet. They sat down at a table with waves almost crashing at their feet. The bartender quickly brought her plate over to the table, along with a bottle of gin, some ice, a bowl of limes, and tonic water. The bartender clearly knew him.

They sat at the little table under the kaleidoscope of colored lights reflecting off the mosaic CD tabletop. They shared stories of places they’d been, food they’d tried, and things they’d seen. The music and gentle sea breeze mixed with their stories and laughter, floating their conversation out across the water and into the night. As time went on, the other customers slowly disappeared until it was just the two of them, though neither noticed.

Eventually, the bartender stopped by one last time, telling him to help himself to anything he wanted and that she’d bill him later. She gave him a wink and a hug, mentioning she was heading to bed. She motioned to a little house in the back and wished them goodnight. He thanked her. They must have known each other well because when she said goodnight, she called him by his real name. That was rare, at least as far as she knew. It seemed to her like they might have been lovers, but she didn’t mind if they were. She hoped he'd had dozens. She had never been the jealous type. 

They were alone now, and this added an unexpected level of tension. The song “Apocalypse” by Cigarettes After Sex started playing. Hearing it, she immediately thought of how this song had always reminded her of him and his stories.

He grabbed the bottle and nodded in the direction of some broken-down beach lounge chairs by the waves. They walked over and sat down, one of the chairs partially breaking under her. They laughed—whether from the gin or the joy of the moment, it didn’t matter. They spent the next several hours lying there, sometimes in silence, sometimes not. At one point, they both dozed off but never at the same time.

They’d given up on mixing the gin and were now just drinking from the bottle, passing it back and forth. It nearly got lost a couple of times to rogue waves, but they laughed as they chased it, corking it with an old wine cork. This happened again and again, and it was funny to them every time. 

At one point, she said, “Remember that job we had? The one where we met?”

He paused, as if struggling to recall it, and looked out at the ocean for several moments, sighed, then back at her. “Barely,” he said with a smirk, though he sounded almost serious. They looked at each other, paused briefly, and then erupted in laughter. 

They watched the tide recede and dawn’s light creep in. Twilight, both morning and night, was her favorite time of day. The deep black night was fading into navy velvet blue, then into twilight. The momentary pause between night and day was beautiful to her because it was so brief. They continued to talk while passing the gin bottle back and forth. Before long, birds chirped, and the twilight melted into orange daylight as the first warm yellow light peeked out over the horizon, casting a pink blush over the beach and water. It was a perfect sunrise. She knew she’d always remember it. She got up to collect seaglass.

He watched her for a while and asked if she’d always collected seaglass. She explained she’d never had much money for souvenirs and felt it was something she could keep without robbing nature. She started collecting in her teens and had pieces from every beach she’d visited—Greece, Scotland, Manhattan, LA, Miami. She’d kept it all in a jar, but during her divorce, her ex had thrown it away. Before she retired, she had a lamp in her office she would fill with seaglass, and she watched as her life and memories filled up again. The same lamp was on her boat. She looked at him, shrugged, and said, “It wasn’t a happy marriage.” She sat back down, then reclined on the lounger.

He went to take another sip from the bottle but realized it was empty. Buzzed, he stretched, gazed out at the calm, endless water, then turned to her with a smile. “So,” he said, “how about a tour of my boat?” He extended a hand. She grabbed it and rose from the comfort of the worn beach chair, drawn by the prospect of something better.

As they walked toward the dock, their shoulders bumped casually. They reached his boat. She regretted not looking at the name before it was too late. He stepped onto the boat, and as she was about to follow, he paused, almost blocking her entry. “You know,” he said, “sometimes the best destinations are the ones we never plan for.” She smiled and stepped onto his boat, resting her hand on his. Their eyes met, dancing with unspoken possibilities. Leaning in close, she whispered in his ear, “I agree.” He held her gaze, their smiles meeting in the soft glow of dawn.

They’d been up all night, so she yawned and joked, “I bet anything you have coffee.”

He laughed. “Betting these days? How much? Are you a gambler?” She laughed. He was always funny. “Sure, I have coffee—come on down.” He disappeared below deck. She hesitated, looking back at her boat. Maybe this was a terrible idea; maybe she should just take off forever. That’s what she’d normally do. She bit her lip, her head buzzing from the gin. She needed that coffee. In a brief moment of courage, she followed him below deck.

The hull looked just as she’d pictured it—fishing poles, cookbooks, dried herbs, maps, his writing—all of it. He handed her a cup of coffee. The best cups need nothing added. She liked that he knew and appreciated that. She thanked him, wrapping her hands around the warm cup, and leaned her back against the counter. They stared at each other.

It always felt like he could see into her soul, and she always wondered why. It hadn’t changed. He walked over to her and said, “There’s something I’ve always wanted to do.” Not breaking eye contact, he slowly took the coffee cup from her hand and set it on the counter next to her.

If you ever see me staring blankly 🫥 out of windows, this is what I’m picturing. Not this story but the boat in it, the freedom and utter peace I will one day experience with that. 🙂 I hope you liked it. If you didn’t, that’s okay too.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

It was only 6 days and I developed a crush quickly. We got close. We met up for coffee a week later before she started working the job she has now. And then we spent 4 months just talking through instagram. No flirting, but a lot of talking about hanging out which finally happened last week. She actually initiated for a dine-in movie where she works. I looked my absolute best so I hope I made a good impression.

Now, this is where she muted me. It was about a month after having coffee in the summer. We had been talking and then she posts hanging out with a guy. Now I did some snooping, and they were together but i dont know if they are still together or just friends with some feelings there. After this story post - i didnt message her for a couple days. And thats around the time i found out i got muted from seeing her stories. I was liking all her stories (not replying) but didnt like her story with the guy. Is that why? Was she already bothered by me even though we just started talking? Does she not want me to see her stuff with the guy and thus keeping me around and interested?

I don't know. I really don't. She's been down for anything - amusement park, movies, rooftop movies, and other 'just us' stuff. She has never mentioned having a boyfriend to me. So what do you think? Should i just ask her why? Perhaps not ask why but apologize for anything i may have done to warrant that or just earn that privilege back? She still sees my stories and again, looks to hang out with me again and talks normally to me with emoji's. 

i don't try to have a deep conversation with her as she's a bit of a slow texter and i prefer to leave that to in person meet ups. I mean, she definitely likes me as a friend.

However, need to monitor upcoming quarterly results.  Positive talk has to convert to results and eliminate the inevitable bad quarter each year (a la Q2 in 2024).

Earnings call focused on profitability over revenue, proactively allocating capital to acceptable ROI opportunities, retail pricing having stabilized and 2nd half of D2 not being converted to cannabis until ROI is acceptable.  Will allocate flower to most profitable markets - whether Canada or globally.

***Positive items***

* $4.2M OCF and $1M FCF generated in Q3. Vff has **NOT** had two consecutive quarters of OCF since at least 2021, when I started tracking.
* 'Produce' generated quarterly net income
* Cash position stabilizing.(?) Cash only down $1M sequentially from Q2.  It previously dropped $5M in 4Q23, dropped $4M in 1Q24, and dropped $2M in 2Q24.
* Internally funding Leli buildout (no debt or revolver borrowing).  $12M euro annl rev estimate based on 2,000kg of production.  Estimate sales price of $9 euros / gram, 60% gross margin.  At least, Q2 before full quarter of rev/profit.

***Middle of the Road***

* Inventory flat lined from Q2.  Recall their $15M draw down in Q2 creating potential for cash flow headwind.  In addition, mgmt noted their popular milled product was out-of-stock for majority of Q3 (mgmt estimated missed rev of $2.5M).
* Possible M&A activity such as vertically integrating coffee shop(s) in Holland.  Walk before they run??

***Needing Improvement***

* Four quarters running of of Canadian cannabis gross margin in mid-twenty percent range.  Discussed on Q3 conf call, saying their opportunistic B2B sales are pulling GM lower than 30%-40% target range.  Now proactively reallocating capital away from low margin SKUs and selectively raising pricing elsewhere.

***Most interesting comment on conf call***

* Analyst asking Mike if they are considering a buyback (using revolver) with shares trading so cheaply?  Mike wisely refused to comment.  However, both the question and the quick response - curious.",1,1731296500.0,VillageFarms,0,1.0,False

About a year and a half ago I got cheated on.
The past four months I have been trying to start dating again and I dowloaded Tinder and Hinge. To my surprise I actually matched with some really cute and nice guys. Two out of three of them I met in person and took me out on a date. I have made my intentions clear that I was looking for a relationship.

The first guy took me out for coffee and a walk, we went back to my place to watch a show. I thought it was going super well and we had nice conversation and when he left he kissed me goodbye and we planned another date within the next couple of days. He told me that he was ""busy"" and had to reschedule. I didn't hear him until 3 weeks later I got a dm from him saying ""do you want to meet to just have s*x?"". When we matched he said he wanted the same thing as me; a serious relationship.
When we matched he told me ""let's meet so we can see how we get along and maybe we can become serious quicker"". Him talking about wanting a relationship to only wanting me as a f*ck buddy made me feel super shitty.

The second guy was so sweet. We matched and have been texting constantly. A couple days of texting we met. He was so sweet he even called me before he came to pick me up to tell me he got into traffic and was going to be late. The plan was to go for coffee and go for a walk. During coffee we sat down, laughed and had a good time and he was already planning when we were both free so we can plan another day within the same week. We were having a good time and I thought we vibed. He excused himself to the bathroom and when he came out his phone started ringing. He apologized and said he had to take it. I didn't think anything of it and shrugged it off. He went outside I could see him on the phone pacing. He said his friend's mom fell down the stairs and he had to leave to go help.
He seemed nervous when he was driving me back he kept apologizing and he was tapping on his steering wheel. I thanked him for the short time out, I told him I hope he has a safe drive and that everything is okay with his friend's mom. I asked ""can we reschedule?"". He agreed.
A COUPLE HOURS LATER. He took me off Instagram, stopped answering my messages, and unmatched with me on tinder (or maybe he deleted tinder I couldn't see his profile anymore) my account was paused.
When I noticed this I WAS ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED AND WAS SOBBING. I thought it was going well and he even said he would see me again?!?! I am so confused.
The fact that I have had two failed dates in the past two months, am I the problem? Did I say or do something that keep turning off men?
What can I do to go on better first dates or to stop scaring men off? I have no idea what I keep doing wrong. I really like the second guy should I try to text his number or leave a voicemail?

1goixev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/1goixev/my_number_8_is_back/,My number 8 is back!,"This weekend felt a little extra special.

I was excited again. All my joy in the last 4 weeks had felt lacking. Everything was perfect like a dream, but something was missing. The perfection for a 100. You know the missing link in life which is excited about going forward, with the life where you have the backing of love, and the life where we work for the stability of the present (& a little future).

The missing link was back!

This Sunday morning I woke up with a sense of refreshment, I did not think about monday. I had an exciting Sunday to live thru. Monday will be dealt with on Monday. I woke up, freshened up, picked up the jersey I knew I was going to be wearing for the past 3 days, filled my travel mug with black coffee, took my keys, and head out of the door. With JDX’s background score pumping me up, I drove thru empty roads, quick lights, and found my parking spot 30 minutes away from home.

I was excited. I was going to a place filled with fans of the team I support. People who share the same energy as me. People who would hoot when i do. People who will jump when i do. People who will take deep breaths when I do. Doesn’t sport do that to you?! There is a reason, the most passionate people in the world can be found at sporting events. I was going for one such event!

I walked into a familiar pub where I had been been on for other mellow games on some other weekends. But today the place looked different. It was carrying a weird energy. The energy was Blue rather than Red. It took me a bit to come in terms with the place I was at. We were outnumbered. I wasn’t mentally ready for this. This was exactly the opposite of what was in my head. These people would hoot when I am down. The people who give me death stares when I cheer.

Well, anything that can’t kill you can only make you stronger. Ain’t it?!

In the middle of this warzone, I found a tribe in Red and whites, holding their fort strong. I took a spot by this tribe. With a renowned sense of hope. With a replenished excitement, for I knew I was in a good place, and that things are very much in control. With the 90 minute running down, I followed the ball from one boot to another, thru feints and turns, thru a solid backline, thru a stable midfield, to a passionate forward line, the ball was being dribbled thru, towards a Goal.

There was control.

He was in a relationship with another poly person who I'll call K, and after a few months of seeing eachother it messed me up too much that he wouldn't start seeing me as a partner so we stopped talking for about a week. In hindsight my jealousy of K might have been a symptom that I am simply not cut out to be polyamorous.

When they broke up a while later for other reasons we saw eachother again for a few months and N asked me to be his girlfriend. 
We were so happy. 
In November/December last year N stared seeing one of his friends S and I started seeing her too but she and I never really. . . Connected? I remember being a little insecure but never fully truly fucked up about the relationship. S broke up with us a little while later because she wasn't ready for a relationship.

Several months after that he started seeing Y and I just couldn't take it I guess. I have very fuzzy recollections of what was happening around that time and I can't remember exactly why they stopped seeing eachother but I assume it's because I asked him to.

He's flirted with a few people on and off since and it's never been very serious. Our relationship was pretty good, pretty great. We got a puppy together. And I love our dog more than anything.

Recently he was seeing some people again, and it bothered me a little but I didn't really say anything. Maybe I made a mistake asking for details? But that was one of the things that bothered me with Y, that he wasn't sharing.

About 6 months ago I made a new friend O(26F)  and the 3 of us got on really well. Then things went wrong. I don't know if I had feelings for O but I really was attracted to her, N and I had both been flirting with her in a friendly way through entire time we'd known eachother but then we all got high one night like 3 weeks ago and since then I hadn't been able to get it out of my mind that I wanted to kiss her. And N was very supportive of that. So I had a small crisis and we spoke about it and I sort of thought we resolved to maybe kiss and see if she even liked girls.

She and N started talking and he got really excited O joining the polycule. This took me by surprise because she and I had just been talking about kissing. 
We resolved to get together that weekend and talk.
I expressed multiple times I was scared that doing this would change the dynamic but in the end after many assurances that I could pull the plug any time I said we could try.

Then a few gins and tonics later we all had a threesome. Which was the worst idea ever. It happened too fast for me to figure out what I was feeling. We were all a little tipsy. It was just insane, and I was so horny I wasn't thinking straight.

The next day after I sobered up I started feeling scared. N was so into O and it scared me a lot. I got scared of them spending time alone. I got scared that they'd leave me behind and I told them this. And they asked me to just wait a little and see. Then I tried to break up with them both.

I don't think either of them took that as seriously as I meant it.

They talked me into giving it more time and I said I would.

Monday came and after talking to my best friend I decided that it might be best to pull the plug and I asked N if we could. He said yes and then asked me again to just give it more time. 
Tuesday and I sat with it, I thought about it and I again asked to close the relationship. He said yes and then asked me again to just give it more time. 
Wednesday we met for coffee and did a talk and a cry. And he finally opened up to me about why being polyamorous meant so much much to him and for him I agreed to give it another try.
Thursday he stayed at my place and it was we talked more and I cried more and it just never felt . . . Quite right? 
I couldn't get settled. I'd be so happy with him one minute and just bone deep sad the next. Friday came and I went to his place and O met us there and I was just uncomfortable the whole time. I tried talking to O about it and it just made her sad and scared and I didn't want that. So when the 3 of us sat down to talk after dinner it all culminated into me breaking up with them both. They said they were in love and I couldn't take it. I had a big break down and spent the night crying.

In the morning O and I were both up early in a thunderstorm and we talked but I can't remember what about.

Then I got back up to go back to the couch in the lounge where I was sleeping. And I saw N and his mum were sitting with the dogs in the thunderstorm so I decided to go and sit with them and help with the dogs, one of whom is our shared pup.
N and I ended up falling asleep on the couch in the front room (a different room to where I had been sleeping the previous night) and when I woke up I felt good, really good. I felt like the bad shit had melted away and that he was mine again and I could try again.

We went out to brunch and O was insecure because I kept changing my mind and she felt like she was about to be kicked out. I decided that I had to stop doing that to her and just broke up with them both again and things were said and I stormed off in a huff. Which was awkward because they were my ride.

We eventually met back up and I asked N to take me home. I said some horrible things to him and he finally broke and we had a really honest conversation. And he took me home and we just couldn't say goodbye so we wandered through my local mall and we talked and we joked and we talked. He asked me to give it a week. And I agreed. But nothing is changing. I've agreed to see a therapist and maybe that will help but I could really use some advice here and now please ",1,1731295138.0,polyamory,8,0.67,False
1goiod3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1goiod3/my_closest_friend_chose_her_exrapist_over_me/,"My ""closest friend"" chose her ex-rapist over me.","TLDR: Me and a close friend started talking again as I helped her through an abusive relationship breakup, we started to get closer again and things were looking good. She had this ""friend"" who at a previous time told me raped her when she was younger and that he was her first boyfriend. Eventually as a few months passed the two of them were getting closer and closer as she was slowly pulling away from me.  I called her out as she tried to deny and lie to me by telling me that they were two seperate people. Finally removing me and those two ended up together. 



Full story:

me (20m) and this girl who I'll call H(f21) met two years ago at a job we were both working at. Things were going well and we were getting close. As we became mates I started to notice things weren't normal and quite clearly there was something going on in the background. To cut the story down a bit she asked me to come into work as a ""support"" person one shift as she wasn't sure if she could manage to get through the day at work because something awful happened.  This was fine for me, I was happy to help and overtime is more money at the end of the day. At the end of the day she'd often call me up and we'd spend a lot of time together over the phone. She'd then explain in full the situation and why this was happening. She was currently ""dating"" someone, and the reason I put it in quotations is because to this day I'm not fully sure what they were. H told me that he was physically and emotionally abusive and that he'd demand updates from her 24/7 and she couldn't have any other friends. As a result, I had to follow certain rules to keep her safe. I could never message first, I always had to act like she was a colleague and not a friend until ive ""verified"" it was her messaging me and we couldn't hang out because he would demand updates. So calling was the best way for us to ""hang out"" and spend time together.  We'd often spend 8 hours on shift together, spend another 1 or 2 hours in the staff room together and then once home another 5-6 hours on call. Of course this wasn't everyday, some days she would have to go visit this person because ""she'd have the ability to run away from his house, but if he is around hers she would be trapped"". And in retrospect, perhaps we spent too much time together and it was unhealthy. To wrap up this little section, life was shit for her but she told me that I was the one thing that made her smile during this time and someone she could confide in. This spanned from November 2022 until May 2023. To be truthful, I could be pushy at times to try and help her. I never went out of my way to purposely do things to get her out of this situation but i'd try to talk to her about potential plans and what she wants to do. Looking back, she wanted to talk to me to get out of the situation and to escape and I was not helping by bringing it up.

As we spent more and more time together we hung out properly for the first time in months since we met that was outside of work and calling.  She phoned me up asking if I wanted to meet for a coffee because she's had an awful day and needs to forget about it.  We spent the day together and things were great, we had fun and all in all an amazing day. She would text me around 12-1am and asked what I thought about her, asking if I ""felt the same way and cared about her in the same way she did about me"". Now for most people, this would be a clear hint and be very obvious but it wasn't to me for the following reasons: H had spent the entire time that we knew eachother making the same remark over and over, ""Why cant a guy and a girl be best friends, why does everyone assume we're dating"" She was also on Tinder and telling me about all the matches she had and potential dates. And I was incredibly tired, I started work at 4am so being awake until 1am was late for me. Lastly, by this point I had clearly fallen for her but I pushed my feelings down as far as I could because I didn't want to let her down. She was going through a tough time and I wanted her to know she had a rock to lean on and not someone trying to just get with her. Anyway, when I questioned what she meant she shut down and told me to ignore the messages and that it doesn't matter and shes an ""idiot for thinking that we felt the same way about eachother"" This happened in April 2023, and for about 2 weeks after this we fell out and didn't talk too much. I attempted to bring up the situation to her and every time I tried she would reject it and either ignore me and just say we aren't talking about it. Eventually telling me that I can't let the past go and keep trying to bring up old problems. From my point of view, this wasn't an old problem and I wasn't bringing up the past. This is something we haven't talked about and is affecting our friendship.  Eventually I finished an hour before she did and I got her to admit to things. She admitted that yes, she was into me and she put her self out there multiple times but I didn't see it and I made her feel worthless. But ultimately it doesn't matter anymore because she doesnt feel that way. But at the same time she needed a month of no contact so she could ""rethink through her fellings and get over it"" Throughout May we attempted to keep our ""friendship"" (Im not sure what you would consider what we had at this point) alive but I was getting tired of things. She would now purposely tell me about guys she's talking to that are making her ""feel so special and cute"" and how everyone on snapchat is asking her out but the one guy she wants wont.

To jump back a bit (Apologies its difficult remembering every single detail of something that happened 2 years ago lol) I had a colleague and me and him were good mates. We weren't close and we wouldn't hang out outside of work but we looked out for eachother and got along. I was 18 and brand new to my job and he was the one who trained me up and made me good (This was a solid 6-7 months before I met H) Some drama happened and he split up with his girlfriend and lost his kids. He would often phone me up at  like 10pm black out drunk trauma-dumping on me. The reason this is important is because H told me that this colleague sexually harrassed her and asked for her as his ""birthday present."" this was 2 months before we fell out.  Once we had our issues, I  learned that she was talking to this colleague and flirting with him to get at me. They were both telling me everything obviously trying to hurt me. After a week or two, they stopped talking and he tried to be my mate and act like nothing happened. Things were bubbling at the seams and eventually they burst. She was fired in late May/early June and I left my job in September. We fell out, I was hurt as I felt I was being used and lied to. It's fine that things didn't work out between us but stop playing games with me and tell me honestly. Stop saying you want something more from me but at the same time you dont and its just my imagination.

  
We would be on and off talking until around September 2023, she got the abuser guy arrested and she was now free. But still we couldn't see eye to eye, I wanted an explanation for her actions. Why she did what she did. But she wanted to move on and pretend like nothing had happened. I was unable to accept this and as a result we went our seperate ways.

  
\---------------------------------------Present day, actually relates to the title!----------------------------------------

  
It was may 14th 2024, the reason I remember this is because I had gone out for a staff night out in my new job. We were saying goodbye to a colleague who was leaving. I had a fun night out, got pretty drunk but no where close to being blackout and headded home. Chilled on a game or two with my mates and was ready to go to sleep as I was tired as I had worked the entire day. Suddenly I got a call from her. she apologised for how she acted with me and said that she didn't have a choice. She wanted to talk to me about everything but she wasn't allowed. She told me that she had been in a pseudo-relationship acting like she was with this new guy. And that he had finally left and she was devasted because she cared about him but he was abusive and had her down as a ""carer"" for him because of his Autism/ADHD and as a result she wasn't able to work a normal job and was trapped. She didn't know how to feel, one hand she did care for him genuinely but on the other she was trapped. I would spend 6 hours on the phone to her calming her down and making sure she was okay. She explained to me everything that happened and that she pushed everyone out of her life and she was starting here with me. I then booked a train to go see her and spent the entire day with her including helping her sort out the tenancy of the flat and removing herself from it, helping her pack up her things and taking her to the council to try and help her get a temporary place to stay. I was on 0 hours sleep and walked probably close to 20 miles that day, to say I was exhuasted would be an understatement. This person who I'll call M was also there. 

Now back when we were close a year prior, H told me about someone else called M who was her first boyfriend and who raped her when she was younger. I talked to her about it and at first she just brushed it off, no this is a different M even though they share the same name, same age and look the same. I said okay because I was more focused on getting her safe and set up. From may to July things were good. We'd spend a lot of time together, she'd come around mine a lot and we'd just hang out. She was currently staying around M's place as she had no where else to go. She did have a studio flat that the council did supply but she stated that she didn't feel safe alone and even though it was an woman block of flats she was offered drugs and wanted to be else where. 

  
Trouble started again when I tried to tell her that I felt underappreciated and im not sure whats going on. By this time, I had spent an entire day at work and then waited at a police station until half 3 in the morning as an emotional support person for her. I was available many times at 1/2am when she was lonely and would be sending me depressed and suicidal reels on instagram. I would be there to answer calls and texts asap even at work. And we would hang out, but every time we'd plan something together she would turn up late (at the best of times) but most of the time she wouldn't turn up at all and stand me up. she would offer no reason for not meeting me and get annoyed when I asked for a reason why.  I tried telling her that im not asking you to pay me back for anything, I'm not bringing up things ive done and expecting you to return a favour. Im bringing up the things I've done for you because im only asking for the bare minimum. If you dont want to hang out or you cant, cool just let me know and don't ghost me. Communicate with me. Especially when you sit on the end of the bed and tell me that im one of the most important people in your life and that ""im stuck with you for life"".

We had planned a day together for a week and I was going to talk to her about things. the previous two times she had stood me up and ghosted me on our plans and unfortunately it happened the 3rd time as well. By this time, I said fuck it and messaged her my feelings. I told her that I still feel the same way that I used to for you and the things you're doing is hinting at the same. You're talking to me like you did when we were really close, your asking me the same sort of flirty questions (do I find you attractive, what do I like most about you both physically and mentally, do I find you beautiful) etc, questions that you dont ask really between two platonic friends. Your asking to sit even closer to you so theres literally no personal space between us and when I paid her phone bill she said ""I dont care about my phone because I only want to contact you anyway"". Anyway, long story short, she shut down again on me similar to last year and went silent on me for 2-3 weeks.

She contacted me randomly saying ""thank you for being there for me when you were but time to make your goodbyes"" and threatened to kill herself. Of course I tried to rush down to the beach and she said she'd drown herself and luckily she messaged me saying she was safe. She would ghost me for another 2 weeks.

  
Now when she messaged me again she told me that she had to ""delete our conversations"" and that she does care for me but we could only talk weekdays. M just so happens to work mon-fri. I would later learn that she was trying to keep me as a hidden friend. We met up and she was printing out photos of her and M and she wouldn't show them to me claiming that this was a birthday gift and that she photoshopped herself into the photos. I knew his birthday was in March but I was too tried by now to call her lie. 



She also told me that M was dating a girl called Holly (I dont mind using the name she gave me because she doesn't exist anyways) and that H had known Holly for 3 months. But all of a sudden Holly wasn't her name and she didn't know her name and was using a placeholder. She had known her for 3 months, but not her name? Interesting.

 2 days later we would be on a call together and was talking about things and all of a sudden I heard the door open and she hung up on me. (M was arriving home.)

Finally, we met up in a city close by and hung out for the final time, she made a really obivous comment that sticks with me today. Some older guy (With his wife next to him) was staring at her cleavage. She then told me ""People should make girls jealous of the girlfriend and not their girlfriend jealous of others"" She had a picture of her and M as her background picture on her phone and he was saved as ""my manxx"" and when I got home I decided to call her out. I messaged her saying that if M is with holly, why is his name on your phone ""my man"" and a picture of you two. Holly would not like that and you'd be hurting her going completely against your comment you told me earlier. all I got back was ""wtf is wrong with you"" and then nothing. I was blocked on everything and viola 1 week later they are officially dating. This was at the beginning of August.

  
Fast forward to about 3 days ago.  8th novemeber. She came into my shop and we spoke. She apologised and explained everything:

Yes M and her first boyfriend are the same person. and yes she didn't lie about rape. She told me that she thought he was different now and she was terrified and alone when she was breaking up from the relationship in september 2023. (I know its a lot and its not organised well but im writing this at 3am with work at 8:30 lol) and as a result she went back to him as safety.

Yes she lied to me about her and him, M made her choose. Me or him, and she picked him. She tried to reason with me that she was living around his and she didn't have a choice. I'm sorry, I understand in certain situations you cannot pick but this wasn't one of them. You made your choice, dont back out and admit it. So she was trying to be my mate in secret but could see how it was hurting me so she slowly dragged herself away.

No, we cannot be friends again but she will stay in contact with me every now and again. We cannot hang out as her boyfriend wont like it but she wants to stay in contact because she cares for me. Now I dont want this, you want to keep me around for what? a backup plan? Once again shes using words like ""dont text me during weekends because he might see it"" and im not about that. I'm not a homewrecker no matter how much I dislike someone. And he is completely unaware that me and her spoke 3 days ago. and I work in telecoms and she made a joke that she'd come back in 3 months and come to me the ""phone expert guy"" to help upgrade her.

Once again, i apologise. I'm trying to fit in two years of history into one story without rambling too much. So I do apologise if something doesn't make sense or there isn't enough context.

  
I feel betrayed and backstabbed. To know someone chose a rapist over you and rather than being honest and saying ""look OP, me and M are getting closer and he doesn't like you, we need to scale our friendship back"" she just ghosted me hurts. And I know that conversation isn't easy, but we were two close friends. Hurting me and telling me the truth is better than hurting me by lying and I don't get the honest reason why things happened.

To know that I helped and put so much time and effort into someone for it all to be thrown back into my face. Once again, im not saying I did anything for a return favour. Absolutely not.  But I still feel used. I was there when she needed me and now that she has someone else im gone.

And staying in contact? Even if its once every 3 months, why? You chose M over me so see it through until the end, dont contact me when he doesn't like it.

And what irked me the most was when she told me that I was being rude when she spoke to me. Like what? I was being blunt. I'm looking into the eyes of someone I cared for knowing they chose a rapist ex over me. Gave me no explanation and left me for dead. So what? Am I meant to just smile and treat her like my best mate? I tried my hardest to be civil and nice but I was doing everything I could to keep myself together, I wanted to break down. But im a manager, im number 2 in the shop, and I couldn't afford to not be professional.

I obviously still care, and I suppose time will heal all wounds. But as much as this rant is about something thats happened now, I guess it all ties into the 2 years I knew this person. Thank you for whoever reads this through, but ive needed to scream about this forever now. I need to look at the positive, im an assistant manager at the age of 20 and I can take it further I earn decent money for someone my age and I live comfortable. But this person has drained everything out of me.

This turned out longer than I was expecting but thanks for reading the rambles of some random 20 year old man online ",1,1731295126.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

I got good grades at A-level and I do have my head screwed on despite everything.

I put the pan upside down in a 500 degree oven for an hour and 15 mins then pulled it out to cool off since I was going to bed.

The butterfly hill farm store is the coolest place ever and if you've never been it is really a hidden gem around here. The owner is the sweetest human on the planet, she makes scones and coffee and gives it to visitors FOR FREE.

She has amazing items in the store that make really wonderful gifts! She also will give you free alpaca food. One of the alpacas just had a baby five days ago.  They aren't there every single weekend but most weekends, call ahead to make sure.

Just a few warnings, they do spit at each other if they are upset one is getting food and they aren't but sometimes it'll miss the alpaca or hit you. This is rare but a possibility. 

Another warning is during the holidays they have santa and elf hats on and you may die of cuteness overload.

That is all. Wishing everyone a lovely holiday season!

Quick back story: I’ve known him since we were 14 years old. We dated and banged for roughly a month before, we went out different ways… never made it official then. Then years later we reconnected on Facebook when we were 24 and fooled
around together for a year, nothing serious, I’d go and drive up and visit him (he lives an hour away) we’d have sex and I’d leave and never spend the night. We lost
connection in 2019-2020.But then fast forward in 2022, we reconnect after running into each other at a tattoo removing company, we started seeing each other once a month at his place, he would buy my drinks,
wanted me to spend the night and then bring
me coffee in bed then take me out for breakfast and kiss goodbye. Would be in contact every few days, then would
come to my place and take me
out for dinner and a movie every other month when he visited me and spend the night over.
Mind you, we would have these deep
conversations and he made me a
playlist when I visit.. I know what he wants
to do to his body when he dies and know deep understanding of his family stuff. But, mind you I kept hoping he’d put a label on us… never did but mind you, he did date a
girl after me in high school and were engaged for 12 years after we met again in 24. She cheated on him as they split. Also, he’s on the spectrum and so am I (self diagnosed) but, we were doing dates and seeing one another often for two years, definitely a situationship… I’m
35F and he 35M… till I sent him this video that says :

““What is it that you want from me? Because it’s not a relationship and it’s not nothing. So what is that you want from me? Is it comfort that fills your body knowing that I’m just there ? Is it the fact if nothing else works for you, I will be there? Is it comfort of knowing that ? Is it the ease of understanding that, you know I have so much love to give but some reason it’s not enough for you right now ? Yet, you don’t want anything from me but you want everything from me? You don’t want anything but you want everything. And I’m enough but I’m not enough. What is it that you want from me? Because I don’t understand. I don’t get it. I don’t see it and you want what’s convenient  for you; when it’s convenient for you. That’s not me. I want to be wanted. I want somebody to be intentional with me ‘cause I deserve somebody to be intentional with me.  As I am intentional with others. 

What do you want from me really, because, I’m confused “ 

Then he apologizes… but I am
Curious what he means that he felt
some kind of way with me… please clarify since he didn’t ..

1goi9sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1goi9sp/he_finally_agreed_to_couples_counselling/,He FINALLY agreed to couples counselling,"We argued all weekend over his family, but it did start because I asked him to get out of bed and come downstairs earlier than he would on a day he isn't working so he can be with our son before I have a client in my home business. I had to message him asking if he's coming downstairs 10 mins before my client came. I hadn't even had time to eat breakfast and have a coffee because I was looking for this bottle I put food in for our toddler to have his breakfast and I could not find the damn thing. So I had to resort to feeding him because he refuses so many foods at the moment he could feed himself, but I knew I couldn't feed him and feed myself and still quickly get ready. Apparently I have to tell husband a specific time to come downstairs because 10 minutes before my client comes is adequate time. So we argued, he wouldn't see at all where I was coming from and he yelled at me in front of our son. I got upset at him because I have told him previously not to yell in front of our son. I will admit I got emotional, told him I feel like I'm with him just so I don't have to split custody with him and see my kid half the time, called him names and was so upset over the yelling.

After my clients, I got ready for a baby shower whilst our son had a nap and husband and I spoke again about it. He was focused on the things I said to him, and asked if I think I did anything wrong. I said what I said was wrong, and took accountability for that, but he was hell bent on coming down 10 mins before my client is fine.  He went to his nephew's birthday cake, I went to the baby shower with our son. I asked husband to be home by a certain time because I had plans with a friend that night to a theatre show so had to basically get ready as soon as I got home and leave, which was fine, but he got annoyed at me because I got home 15 mins later than I said I would. Didn't realise how long it would take to quickly eat cake, say goodbye to everyone, quickly sign the guestbook that I forgot about before I leave and get a toddler in the car etc. 

The next day we had Santa photos 45 mins away after son's afternoon nap. I had booked this weeks ago, so it felt so fake to be having to smile for a fam photo whilst we aren't happy at the moment. On the way to the photos, we were arguing and on the way back. He was focused on me saying that I am with him only to not split custody, and I told him he doesn't stand up for me to his family. He said he does, he has stood up for our son, but I said that's for our son, but as for the treatment towards me, he hasn't. He said he agrees with me with what they do isn't nice, but I said your family don't know that. You'll go to birthday cake at your sister's house and play happy family, but they will just see that as he doesn't have a problem with them, so it's just his wife that has a problem. I've had to stand up for myself, sitting down and talking with his mum, or having to respond back to her message stating I'm creating a rift between him and his family and picking on her oldest daughter for our no smoking boundary that she has broken multiple times. He said he doesn't want to cause conflict with them, or with anyone. I said it's causing conflict between us??

He told me he thinks I've changed since having our son, which made me so upset because his mum said the same thing to me. I didn't change, my priorities changed, but his family changed towards me because they don't respect our parenting and have been vocal on it. My previous post history details all the events between me and the in-laws. I told him that no matter what his parents say to him, they can do no wrong, but when it's me, I'm the issue. I told him if it's going to be like this forever, I want to divorce because this is not sustainable long term. You know when you're trying so hard to not cry (because I didn't want to have mascara streaks down my face before a professional photo), that your voice is breaking and you are struggling to breathe? Me. I have begged to go to couples counselling because we can't fix this ourselves, we have the same argument over and over. I said if you don't want to even go when your wife is telling you the marriage is broken, you don't want to fix this because it seems the only relationship you want to be fixed is mine with your family. Our marriage is my priority.  

He finally said he'll go, but he doesn't think it will do anything, it's a waste of money and we will separate anyway. He said he's not going to go to my therapist I've been seeing because he thinks she will take my side, which I said she wouldn't, it's unprofessional and that's not what they're there for. I said at least if we try and it doesn't work, then we know it's not salvageable. I've asked him again this morning if could go to this therapist because going to a new one would mean more sessions since we would have to start from the beginning and at least mine has context already. I will go to a new one if he refuses because at least he has agreed, but I'll see what he says.",6,1731293818.0,inlaws,8,1.0,False

Therefore, I'm using this new/throwaway account to post this.

I recently went through a breakup, my girlfriend broke up with me and rightfully so to be honest because I did act like a j\*rk for no real reasons except my personal traumas and past baggage. I really did not want to give up on her or our relationship though I truly love her a lot and even though it's been a month and I'm doing slightly better now, I still can't help feeling depressed about what transpired between us and a heavy sense of regret looms inside with respect to the things that happened.

Background

I dated only one other person before this, however, that was quite a short-lived, long distance relationship and I was mentally and emotionally abused a lot by my then girlfriend and decided to call things off as soon as I realized that she was quite narcissistic and used to project a lot of things on me. We dated for about 3 months, and thorughout the time, she would keep accusing me of cheating or being unfaithful towards her when that was truly never the case. She was the first person I even dated, and as a shy virgin guy from a conservative family, I never even could think of doing something of that sort. On the other hand, she had a male bestfriend who would always be around her, every day of the week, and this honestly made me a bit uncomfortable. I'm not one to restrict anyone's freedoms or how they choose to spend their lives but I did feel that it was in my right to express my discomfort with this situation. She always shot it down saying that I think too much, etc. Meanwhile she would regularly accuse me of cheating on her because I used to visit a (guy) friend's place quite often after my job, to chill out after a long day.

When we broke up (in January 2023), she tried to a lot of shitty things to ruin my life, the details of which I do not wish to get into however I did learn that the male bestfriend she had, was actually her ex-boyfriend and they still used to sleep together (the breaking point for me in that relationship was when she threatened me saying that she will sleep with him). There was another really good friend of her involved throughout, who was actually her current boyfriend at that time even before I came into the picture, with their families knowing about them and planning to get them married in a couple of years. I got to know all of these details after our breakup because things had escalated to our families, and my ex's sister told me about all of these things. There were other revelations too, such as the fact that she was not a virgin which she had told me, not that I cared, she was the one to ask me this question first and lied to my face about it; only to later reveal during the relationship that she lied about it. While I did not and do not care about my partner's virginity and all, I hate lies, I hate people that lie. This entire experience truly shattered me to my core, however, I bounced back stronger.

While this breakup and it's aftermath was taking place, I also had interviews for MBA colleges coming up in less than 3 weeks. With the help and support of my brother and my parents, I was able to storm through and secured admission into one of the best schools in the country. I felt glorious, and truly felt like I emerged stronger after the hardships I faced.

My major learnings from the end of this relationship was to not trust a person so quickly, to recognize how sacred/personal/vulnerable it is like to be in a serious relationship. I honestly dived into this relationship really quickly without getting to know the girl too much first. I have no shame in admitting that I was truly a desparate young man that jumped nto that relationship so head first, though my intentions were always pure towards her.

Current Context

In the summer of 2023, I joined my institute for my MBA programme. The institute has a rigorous culture and curriculum, and relationships do tend to blossom as people spend so much time together working on assignments, chilling, studying, etc. I met a lovely girl (23F) in my class. This time I knew better, I knew that a pretty face isn't all and my outlook had changed significantly. I realized how important I am for myself and those around me such as my family and my closest friends and how critical it is to NOT give away intimacy (physical/emotional) to anyone without first truly getting to know them.

So it began, I asked her out for coffee, everything went quite well. Our liking for each other was mutual and she also came from a conservative household, therefore, we both were taking things slow and one day at a time; going with the flow. While she did have a relationship before me, it wasn't quite proper as that person was her friend first and then they dated for a very short bit only to realize that things were not working out and so decided to call it off. Therefore, it is safe to say that I was her first proper relationship wherein she even got physically intimate with someone. We didn't have our first kiss till like a couple of months. As cheesy as it sounds, I truly fell hard for this girl, and started seeing a future with her eventually and really enjoyed the moments we spent together.

At this point, I feel like it is important to give some more context. I graduated from college (bachelors) in 2021, went on to work for 2 years and then went in for my MBA last year. It is a 2-year programme. My girlfriend on the other hand, is a fresher who never really has lived outside her home and came to pursue an MBA right after her undergraduate studies.

While everything was going swimmingly well, my girlfriend had a male bestfriend, one of our classmates only. She used to hang around with him a lot, to the point where some folks around us felt that maybe the 2 of them were dating. This particular guy in contention was also a bit suspicious to me because he would try to get extremely close with my girlfriend, like calling to wake her up in the morning, and even arriving to her room with another guy drunk in the middle of the night, I happened to be there when this happened and neither me nor my girlfriend felt comfortable with this kind of a thing.

I was completely transparent about my past trauma with my girlfriend from day 1, telling her how I was badly cheated on in a very similar male bestfriend context. And she understood too and acknowledged my insecurities or trauma. I was and will always be truly grateful for her response and understanding nature in this scenario; especially given how quickly people give up these days and she was in no way obligated to keep up with my emotional trauma or baggage and could have simply decided at that point to chuck it. I firmly believe in live and let live, and never want to impose things on anybody, and it's not even my place to do so, therefore, I only ever expressed this as a boundary and discomfort. I also told her that I personally did not feel that that guy had the best intentions for her or was a genuine friend of her. I know how a man's brain works, and therefore I was even frank enough to tell her or anyone for that matter that if I had a friend who's a girl and both of us are single and she offers me intimacy, I would never say no. This skepticism around male bestfriends is a result of my personal trauma as well as me having seen the same thing happening to my elder friends, cousins, etc. These situations usually don't seem to end up well. She, however, trusts her bestfriend completely.

She was great about it, and she did distance herself too. The first year went really well, we create some brilliant memories that I will always cherish, dancing in the night, slow kisses, all the cuddles! Anyhow, come 2nd year and the two of them started hanging out again a lot. The start of year 2 came after a 2 month hiatus where we go for our summer internships. I expressed my discomfort again to her. All this while, I also acknowledged and tried to remind myself that this girl is different, this situation is different, and always tried to curb my emotional triggers when I saw the two of them hanging out together or going out for shopping or something, tried to calm myself down and look at the situation and the facts objectively. Honestly, I do feel that I made good improvements over these 1.5 years and got much better at handling my negative emotions in this context.

Now, in September I came out for student exchange to another country, while my girlfriend was staying back at the institute due to different personal priorities and preferences. For me, engaging in the exchange programme was one of the biggest pulls for a top MBA thus I had to stay true to myself and therefore I decided to still go with it despite her choosing not to go.

One important note here is that our relationship was always truly quite beautiful and we did not have any real problems with each other or our habits/friends/personalities. The root of our arguments was 9/10 times this exact male bestfriend thing.

While from my perspective I explained to her always that I do genuinely trust her (which is why I literally shared my most personal secrets and experiences, which I've never told anyone outside my family) and it is just that one particular guy who I don't have a good feeling about. Had this entire thing been just about my insecurities, I feel like I would have been incessantly possessive about her and expressed discomfort whenever she hanged out with ANY guy, and she does have 2-3 guys in her friend circle at college with whom she regularly hangs out with but I trust those guys. My distrust for this particular guy arises from my observations of his behaviour.

She always perceived this as a lack of trust on her regardless of how much I explained, and I think it makes sense from her perspective because she never had any negative experiences with male friends in her life, therefore was sure that this guy could never mean anything bad or have any alterior motives.

Downill

Now, once I was in another country, I had a lot of time alone and these intrusive thoughts would keep coming in my mind. When I'd left for here, she was at home, and after a couple of weeks she was back in the institute. The first night she was there, she invited that guy best friend and another friend over for food she brought from home and it kind of triggered my discomfort. I expressed the same to her the next day in a peaceful manner and she was quite assuring about it.

Then, one fine night, she sent me something which was kinda NSFW and I panicked when I couldn't recognize the surroundings. And my dumb-ass, impulsive, monkey brain, in a moment of panic indirectly mentioned / implied that that photo doesn't look like her room.

As any self-respecting person would be, she got extremely pissed off and asked for some space and time apart as this came off as a question on her character. She mentioned how I broke her trust. I understand, I respect it. I even offered to fly back for a week to resolve this issue in person, but she rejected the offer and it was also not very financially sensible to do so (though in retrospect I feel like I should have done this anyway).

A week passes. I keep crying everyday, we talked a couple of times in this period but it was mostly just her expressing her feelings and me apologising because I truly was in the wrong and let my emotions get the better of me and said something I really should not have. Then another week passes, I got really anxious at this point that she could be considering calling it quits because it was unusual for there to be such radio silence for so long therefore I decided to sincerely tell her all my feelings, apologise with all my heart, but at the same time I did not want to persuade or convince her to be with me or in the relationship because I do realize that my skepticism/past trauma did negatively affect our shared space negatively at times. That conversation went pretty well honestly, and it felt like she would get back to me the very next day to reconcile and recalibrate. But it was silence again, another week passed by. At this point, I'm depressed as heck, but still did not want to intrude on the space and time she requested for and we mutually agreed to go ahead with. Towards the end of this third week, I had a conversation with one of my best friends back home who also happens to be my girl's bestfriend's roommate. He mentioned about how they had a mini get-together / drinks night a few days back and how he and others (there were 4 other people including my girlfriend and her bestfriend) felt that the two of them were not acting in a very platonic way and things felt off so to say, that they were being too close physically and everyone (3 folks apart from my girl and her bestfriend) felt that way. At this point, my fear that my girlfriend is planning / leaning towards breaking up gets intensified while I also feel sort of cheated in this situation. My friend in this context is also someone I trust dearly and has helped me during my lows in the past too.

My girlfriend texted me the same night while I was asleep and deleted it by the time I could check the message. I was already in a very anxious and panicky mood, thus I asked her if there was something she wanted to say. We eventually decided to talk on call and I confronted her about the entire party situation that I got to know. She mentioned that she was just too drunk and the guy was just helping her walk straight when they headed outside after a few drinks. As usual, our argument went in the same direction as I described above and she decided to call things off and break up. She was pissed out about how I trusted my friend and believed that he was telling the truth and certain that nothing of that sort or basically nothing inappropriate or over the top happened that night. I honestly don't feel like and had explicitly told her right from the start as well that never blindly trust anyone, not even me. She said that she did blindly trust me and if in this situation the roles were reversed (basically me being out in a party and one of her girl friends tells her that something felt odd about me and another girl at that place), she would not believe her friend because she trusts me completely. The endnote of this call still had hope, as she mentioned that we could try to give things another shot in the future after I work on my shortcomings and process my trauma fully.

I also got to know on this same call that she told that guy about the fact that her and me had a fight and were not on talking terms. I got really pissed at this because this really feels like giving your car's keys to the person who was trying to steal your tires. I expressed that I felt that she breached our emotional intimacy by seeking comfort in that guy (especially after I got to know that what she told me was not the complete truth about her not being able to walk straight, but it was also the fact that she crying and her bestfriend was trying to comfort her). My girlfriend confronted my friend (the one who told me about the entire incident) and also to her guy bestfriend almost immediately (the next day or within a couple of days), which is also when I got to know that her bestfriend was comforting her when she was crying that night.

She got extremely triggered and denied about having breached any kind of emotional intimacy, and told me that all I do is accuse her and that now she's lost complete faith in me and that now there is no scope of getting back. She eventually went on to now block me from all possible platforms, and wants absolutely nothing to do with me which she made her friends convey to me as well.

I feel this was quite an unfortunate time to have this argument as we're in different countries, and the sequence of events also was quite unfortunate in retrospect.

This really sucks, I feel like a terrible person everyday. To be completely frank, I admit that the major fault and shortcoming in this entire debacle was definitely mine. It's also like I became someone I hated (with reference to my ex who used to accuse me of cheating) and while not at the same level or as explicitly, I did kind of a similar thing with my current girl, and this realization hits bad.

But, I also feel like she could have respected my boundaries better and with respect to the debate on boundaries and breaches of intimacy, I don't think that the other person gets to decide what I feel is a breach or not (thoughts?). One thing that stings a lot is that I understand that this downfall of our relationship happened due to a difference in understandings and expectations of how relationships work and of boundaries. I feel like when you're in a committed relationship, you need to maintain some distance with others of the opposite sex, which I always did and have seen my elders do too. But she somehow never understood this and always saw my words as dismissing her judgement and mistrusting her which I swear to god was truly never the case, and she believes that the reason for us breaking up was my lack of trust on her which is genuinely not the case because if it were I'd never share with her the deepest, most personal things about my life.

To make matters worse, I'm alone in a foreign land, people here don't speak English too so apart from one friend from my home institute who has come here with me, I really do not have anyone else to talk to. I'm back in therapy, which I'd already started while we were in our relationship as I committed to get rid of my past trauma. I honestly feel that I have improved over the last 1.5 years (being less of a crybaby about this male bestfriend discomfort situation) and still was actively taking measures like meditation, therapy, exercise to overcome my past demons.

I really just feel that we could have made things work, and maybe we could just have taken a break for a few months while I worked on my issues and got better and then try to work it out again instead of calling it quits. However, I understand that everyone operates in different ways and have their own take on things thus I do respect her decision. I have stopped contacting her in any way or form, though I think it's going to take a really long time before I get her out of my mind.

I still truly love her a lot and feel like we should try to give it another shot, not immediately of course but few months down the line when the dust has settled. I don't want to have the regret that I did not try to mend things. At that point if she agrees to try again, that's wonderful, we'll try again with clearer expectations and alignment. If she says no, then no worries, I'll make peace with it and move on with my life, I got really big dreams! Though I'll always be her well-wisher, because she truly is an amazing, genuine person.

I'm really sorry for this extremely long post, I just had to pen down my thoughts somewhere, and felt like the elder and more experienced folks on here could offer me some advice on how to deal with such a situation and how to deal with these emotions.",3,1731293559.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

1goi6er,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1goi6er/are_my_salivary_gland_issues_related_to_my/,Are my salivary gland issues related to my current cavities and impending root canal?,"I am going to give as much info about my situation and hopefully update with xrays by end of day tomorrow. I am a 34 female who just visited the dentist for the first time in 10 years. I have about 7 cavities ranging from small to medium and a lot are located between my teeth. I have been experiencing sensitivity to hot, cold and chewing on my left upper molar (#15) for about 6 months. Have had issues for a few years with food getting stuck between #14 and #15 so I started uses water flosser. Turns out there is a deep cavity in-between on #15 and the dentist reccomended me to endodontist for root canal. The pain got really bad when water flossing the past few days and that's what prompted me to finally get it looked at as the pain was shooting into my left temple. It was debilitating.

My gums are all mostly in good condition with nothing that concerned the dentist.

I brush most days twice and have used a water flosser religiously for at least a year. Prior to that I flossed a few times a week. My diet is relatively balanced. I stay away from sugary sodas but I do love diet coke and sugar free energy drinks. I don't drink them every day but indulge a few times a week. I drink coffee, I don't smoke or drink alcohol. Both of my parents have history of dental issues. 

Here's the last bit of info that I'm wondering how much it has affected my teeth. For the past year or so I have woken up in the morning with terrible dry mouth. I also experience dry eyes. I live in Arizona so our climate is very dry too. But I have had 2 instances in the past year where the salivary gland on the right side of my face swelled up to the point of my calling out of work and getting antibiotics. The last time I was in the ER because it happened so fast in the middle of the night and it was painful. I guess my dad also had issues with his salivary glands.

I'm just wondering how much of this might be connected and where to start with making improvements so that I don't have terrible teeth going forward. I also just recently read that water flossing shouldn't take the place of regular flossing because it doesn't break up the build up the same way. I had never heard that before. Also I was using my water flosser on high setting. Is it possible I damaged the enamel in between my teeth making them more susceptible to cavities? 

Again, I will update with xrays asap. Any thoughts on all of this would be greatly appreciated!

**Summary**

***The skies are vast and filled with enemies, and I’ve got them in my crosshairs.***

 

*Rest and relaxation don’t last forever. A little bird has arrived with a special mission for me and my team. It’s a job only we can handle.*

 

*We must return to the site of our previous battle to search for intel and technology, but the Empire will do everything they can to stop us.*

 

*Even if it means hunting us to the edge of the world.*

 

*I’m back in the sky where I belong, flying head-first toward danger. Thankfully, I’m not alone. There’s a beautiful wolf, lion, and squirrel girl keeping me company, both in the sky and in my cabin.*

 

*Old enemies, and old flames, stand in my way. Once I clear one obstacle, another appears to thwart me.*

 

***I’m pushing myself to the limits to protect those I love. My minder abilities continue to expand, and a mysterious voice guides me to new limits. I need to surpass them all so I can see tomorrow, and continue my push for one hundred kills.***

 

The summary by the author was spot on! He gave us a hint of what to expect, showed his authorial tone, and generally made me want to read this book. The kick-ass cover helped, but the blurb sold it for me. Plus, like I said in the introduction, it was the sequel to a book that I loved!

 

 

**Characters**

The premise alone made this a fun story, but really hit the ball out of the park were the characters in this novel. This novel is told through the eyes of the main character, Captain Walker. We did get a few brief glimpses through the eyes of other characters, but they were the exception to the larger story. While James was the main point of view character, the other players in this novel felt fleshed out, too! Everyone felt like they could walk off the page and join me for a cold beer or piping hot coffee. I say that about the cast of characters all the time because it’s important and very often a place where authors fail to fully actualize their worlds. And just because James is the main character, his love interests, his friends, and other beastkin were given the gift of life through how they were portrayed by the author.

**Captain James Walker:** He’s a US Army Air Corps fighter pilot, but he earned the status of double ace against the German Luftwaffe while he served in Great Britain’s Royal Air Corps. When he was shot down late in 1942, he was sent back to the United States. His nation wanted him to join the war effort after Japan attacked the US at Pearl Harbor. Like many Americans fighting under the flags of their allies, they came home to do their duty and lend their combat experience to the unblooded American troops. After the Pearl Harbor treachery, the allies of Imperial Japan declared war as well. That included the Third Reich, the notorious Nazi powers. From there, it was off to the races. Other American combat veterans got to rejoin the fight under their own banner. Unfortunately for James, his hero status as a double ace meant that he was considered more useful selling war bonds. He never got to fight under the American flag because, during one of his aerial demonstrations in his North American P-51 Mustang, he got sucked through some sort of rift into Dione. Once he was there, he had to pick a side in the Great War raging there. He did just that and put his skills to good use. And those skills exceed the purely martial; we learn that he is a skilled minder or mind reader. Well, among other similarly situated skills. But no spoilers. Read the book for yourself! Trust me, you’ll thank me later!

**Major Courtney “Court” Welch:** He is a wolfkin member of the Crestian Imperial Air Forces and a fighter pilot. He’s the son of a Grand Duke and lives a rich and lavish lifestyle. He goes by Court to his friends and has a harem of four for his wives. When James enters the picture, he’s about to be shot down by fighter pilots from the Thurnmar Republic, but James comes to the rescue and takes down the two pilots attacking him. In return for that debt, Court helps him adapt to a new world full of beastkin of every kind. He’s only mentioned in passing in this book, but he was a fun character, sympathetic, and loyal to his home and his canine people. I would love to see if he gets a full villain arc or a redemption story in future books.

**Agent Madeline Reynolds:** She is a minder and an agent for the Crestian Empire’s Ministry of State Secrets. She’s a shifter who appears as a foxkin, but she’s really a rabbitkin and ashamed of being one. She’s the product of her canid dad and her rabbitkin mother. Her mom served as a maid in her dad’s house and was his mistress. She’s the daughter of nobility as well, though illegitimate like I mentioned. Despite that, she’s proud to be a child of the peerage of Crestia. She has minder powers like James does and works for the Ministry of State Secrets for her government. She quickly falls in love with James, and we get to experience a whirlwind romance as she teaches him to use his minder powers. Like all of the love interests in this genre, she’s extremely beautiful and has white hair to match the color of her ears and tail. She’s in her mid-twenties, like James, and is significantly shorter than him. She barely reaches his chin, but she makes up for it with a pair of perky breasts on her lithe body. What could I add besides that she was hot? She’s slightly insane, made so by her participation in Project Lazarus under the visiting Nazis supporting the Crestian cause. During this novel, she’s tasked with bringing James back to her home and getting him to join their cause.

**Flight Captain Hope Barnett Walker:** She is a fighter pilot for the Thurnmar Republic who James shoots down during the opening engagement of book one. She is a wolfkin who didn’t join the canid nation, staying to serve the nation where she’d grown up. When the Crestian Empire attacked Tretshire and killed her parents in a raid, she joined the war effort. She became a skilled pilot and a triple ace, having taken down more than 15 enemy planes in aerial combat. She’s a feisty personality who loves deeply and is extremely loyal. She has the stereotypical dog traits, loving the head pats and being told she’s a good girl. Like all of the harem books, the women are gorgeous, and she was no exception. She has grey furry ears, a matching tail, and silver hair that curls just right to frame her face. She has average-sized breasts, a bubble butt, and a lithe body. What can I say? The author has a type. Or is it just that you have to be at peak fitness for military service? Whatever, she’s sexy and a lot of fun! Now, quick, give her a Scooby Snack, and maybe she’ll do a trick for you! But she becomes more than that, marrying James and becoming his Alpha Wife, leading his harem. When James promises to kill 100 Crestian fighters in aerial combat to prove his loyalty, she pledges to do the same.

**Lieutenant Colonel Addison Harris Walker:** She is a fighter pilot for the Thurnmar Republic and a triple ace as well. She was a famous actress who joined the Thurnmar war effort and served with honor for her nation. She’s a lionkin, who was Hope Barnett’s role model and the reason she went into the Thurnmar Air Corps. She’s a blonde, with ears and tails to match, but more of a curvaceous figure than Hope or Madeline. She leads a fighter wing on the *Astral Communion*, a carrier under the command of her brother, a naval officer. She leads the Black Lions, a fighter squadron made up of mostly women, the long period of war creating a male to female imbalance. She is also married to James, as his second wife and subordinate to Hope on the familial side. That dynamic is fun since she commands her mates on the military side of the house.

**Flight Captain Alyssa Hagarty Walker:** She is a fighter pilot for the Thurnmar Republic, who is a squirrelkin. She becomes James’ third wife and is adorably tiny, someone James describes as a “pint-sized beauty.” She is also a skilled pilot, able to hold her own against the best Crestia can throw at her. She loves to ice skate, and her mother was a skilled figure skater who taught her daughter how to skate as well.

**Deputy Director Priya Lowe:** She’s the second in command of the TIA (Thurnmar Intelligence Agency) and the deputy director. She’s an extremely powerful minder who teaches James how to use his powers. She’s a birdkin and loves to have her wings preened. She becomes James’ fourth wife and helps smooth over the drama from the contentious Operation Junk Dealer. Before the series starts, she was friends with Addison. The two worked together when Addison was on something like a USO tour, minding the stubborn starlet.

**Black Lion Squadron:** This is the aerial unit that James joins aboard the *Astral Communion*. This unit also includes Addiston, who commands it, Hope, Alyssa, Lillian, and Jayden. There might be more fighters in this squadron, but none that were named. I noticed, during the reading/listening, that there only appear to be six fighters in this unit. However, a WWII squadron had twelve, and that was the standard this book tried to use from a world-building perspective.

**TRS** ***Astral Communion*****:** This is the aircraft carrier that holds the Black Lions and is commanded by Addison’s older brother. This flying ship is where most of the stories take place since the fighter squadron is based out of the air carriers. Because of how descriptive the author is, this ship almost feels like it has its own personality, which is why it was included in this section.

 

 

**Plot and Pacing**

First, I’ll be blunt: this book was paced so well that I lost track of time and was shocked when the audiobook ended approximately 13 hours after I started it. I listened to this in three settings because I couldn’t put it down. I was hooked from word one and loved every second of it! I wanted to spend more time in this awesome world, so I pestered Isaac Lee about speeding up on the third novel in this series!

 

I loved the concept of this series, taking the cool ambiance of a World War II setting and putting it into a beastkin setting. I loved how the animal nature was incorporated into the temperament of the nations and characters. These traits lead to the nastier analog of the conflict that made up the Second World War. The Crestian Empire is a stand-in for the Third Reich, right up to their racial supremacy. To pound the point home, the Empire is working directly with a few members of the Nazi Regime. Those vile characters managed to travel to Dione much like James had. This, in turn, serves as a fun subplot for this series.

 

Next, I wanted to talk about the plotting and pacing of the combat. The author wrote compelling combat scenes. This action took into account the unpopular fact that most aerial combat is over very quickly. The pilots didn’t have unlimited gas and ammunition. This forced the pilots to get into the fight and eliminate the target as quickly as possible. If they couldn’t, the pilot had to disengage and return to base before they were sitting ducks. Like in real life, much of the flying happened before and after a battle. The action itself was intensely brief, but it was fun to read. I also liked that the protagonist’s airplanes took damage and that their side wasn’t invincible. That is important in action stories because doing otherwise means that the characters are invincible. Where’s the fun in that?

 

Moving on, this story was extremely well written, with a clear and concise plot that made sense to me. The adventure felt like there was a grand plan for the shenanigans. I don’t know if the author plots or makes it up as he goes, but it felt like he had a roadmap for this novel. Even cooler, there was just the right amount of action split up with thematic lulls where we could catch our breath and refuel our fighter planes. We get to see James’ dog fight with his enemies and then relax as he bonds with his squadron. Then the good captain gets to biblically experience his love interests, and then we’re back to the action sequences. Plus, there was political intrigue and action outside of the cockpit. It kept me hooked from start to finish, and I listened to this audiobook in two sittings. Sleep? Who needs it? Not me!

 

 

**Audiobook Quality**

I listened to the audiobook version of this novel, and it was perfectly done. I shouldn’t be surprised; it was put together by Royal Guard Publishing, and they’re constantly raising the bar on audiobook production. I truly loved hearing these two narrators read the story to me. The accents were odd but built an otherworldly vibe and didn’t grate on my ears. I quickly got used to it and even learned to appreciate it because it built the lore of the world in my mind. The performance of Evan Reed and Amber Hartt was amazeballs. Seriously, they did a phenomenal job and it was a joy to listen to! I can’t wait for the third book to reach the audiobook stores because I’m hooked!

 

 

**Sizzle Factor**

There are several romantic interludes in this book, and James has the time of his life! You will, too, when you listen to it or read the printed word. The author, Isaac Lee, wrote these scenes in plain language without losing the O-Face Factor! The moments in this book weren’t pure sex either; there was romance and intimacy. The love and lust were mixed with genuine feelings that came from the heart. I really felt like this was a romance novel that happened to have schmexy time.

 

This wasn’t a novel where there was constant sexual tension. This was a military portal fantasy, and the ongoing Great War was integral to the plot and pacing. The sex was a bonus, a gloriously hot bonus. The icing on the cake of cool WWII planes doing manly and cool things in the air. Never mind, I take it back… there was sexual tension. The aerial combat was a stand-in for sex, or so my pilot friends tell me.

 

Honestly, the sex didn’t feel like it was an afterthought. It wasn’t added to fit into the genre tropes. No, the romance and sex were lynchpins that held the plot together. The romance and intimacy were baked into the very world-building. Seriously, we had a few casual blowies, some ‘wham, bam, thank you ma’am’ scenes, and even a tryst between James and his plethora of ladies.

 

I loved reading about the group settings where James dominated his women. The power-play scenes between Hope and Addison were also fun to watch. I also enjoyed the scenes where the girls pleasured each other to make their husbands happy. It was hot, like a cat on a hot tin roof levels of sizzling, steamy fun. I’d write more, but I want to let you experience it for the first time for yourself.

 

 

**Overall**

First, I’ll throw this out there… this is the first beastkin series that I’ve read. I wasn’t sure I would be a fan, but after the first one, I was hooked. Seriously, I’m here for the crack Isaac Lee was drip-feeding me! I’m in it to win it, you might say! I loved how the author kept the characters ‘human’ side while they had an animal form. They had ears and tails and could shapeshift during a full moon. Otherwise, they were still human except for some traits from their animal side that made them a fun concept without being overdone.

 

Now, let’s address the elephant in the room… this is a military story, so the action scenes matter. The military culture felt real and lived in, sticking with what you’d expect from someone who’d been there and done that. Even cooler, the dog fights and aerial combat in this novel were well written. I could envision everything in them and was convinced that Isaac Lee had some throttle time, or at a minimum, time as an aircraft mechanic. Wrong, he is just a solid writer who did a crap ton of research. I am usually not incorrect; this was one time I did, to Isaac’s credit.

 

I loved how the author managed the pacing and blocking of the combat scenes. They were fast-paced, and yet there was never an engagement that I couldn’t picture like a movie in my head. I even did the thing where I used my hands as airplanes to maneuver them in tandem with the audiobook narrators. Maybe, allegedly, there might have been some pew-pew noises as I engaged the guns in those dog fights.

 

Moving on, this story is set in the 1940s, and James exists under the shadow of that moment in time. That dynamic, pastiche, was an ambitious setting, but Isaac Lee pulled it off. We got to experience this story through the eyes of the main character, Captain James Walker, and it was fun. He’s a World War 2 fighter pilot, a double ace, and as cocky as the day is long. Seriously, it was fun… probably too much to be legal in my home state! But you’ll dig the [shit on a shingle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipped_beef) that Isaac Lee is serving!

 

However, while the author kept the 1940s vibe throughout the story. He got it right, down to the big band scene while James was on dates with his women. The way fashion was described also fit within the cultural ambiance of the era, which made it easier to get sucked into the world of Dione. I can’t wait to see where Isaac Lee takes this adventure next! I’m so sucked into this world that I’ve been telling myself stories in this franchise. When I’m that invested, I know I’ve stumbled onto something awesome!  

 

Moving on… in the first book, we saw James, a fish out of water, and I really enjoyed that. The main character was as lost as we were, adding to the immersion. As James learned about the world of Dione, we did too. This gives him a fallible opinion, which can be fun to experience. I normally prefer stories in third person omniscient, but this is how first-person stories should be written. We saw the world through his eyes, which was a lot of fun. He viewed the world with the sensibilities of someone who was part of the Greatest Generation, and it kept things fun for the reader. But don’t worry, you don’t have to be a history nerd to enjoy this story!

 

This approach evolved, and by this sequel book we saw James as a more competent character. He becomes a man who’s in control of his destiny. He knows the players and the game. He evolves from existing and reacting into a man who grabs life by the balls and charts his own course. He’s a better pilot, natural-born leader, and husband in this book. I loved watching him grow into his role in the story and think we’re going to see bigger things as he leads Thurnmar to victory over the Crestian Empire.

 

Another aspect to consider would be the culture and temperament of the nation states involved in this story. I won’t give any spoilers, but the Crestian Empire was a rare gem of creation. It felt like the German culture around WW1, except they didn’t have a Kaiser, as far as I could tell. The canid nation-state had the tech of WW2, with some new cool stuff from the magical rare earth mineral that gave them awe-inspiring flight capacities. From the grey uniforms to the names of various things, this felt like a real nation. This is the first polity that we got to experience. I can’t give you spoilers about the big reveal, but this was masterfully done.

 

We don’t know much about Thurnmar, but I do hope that we can see more from this governing body as well. It was the next political entity that we learned about, the Thurnmar Republic being the polity that James and his crew fight for. They’re at war with Crestia because of an event reminiscent of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Instead of dying, this republic was angered at the marriage of the Crestian Grand Duke because it expanded their territory. These kinds of land expansion disputes happen, and in this instance, it felt like a perfect merger of the WW1 and WW2 motifs in a fun way. All of this made sense to me, fitting my understanding of geopolitics and my general historical nerdiness.

 

Now that we’ve covered the world, we have to talk about the characters. I don’t know how much I should say, but the big reveal with the wolf girl (Madeline) at the end of this book shocked the hell out of me. Just when I got the vibes that the empire was like that, BOOM, everything evolved again. It was caught off guard… again… I loved it. I read so much that I’m rarely shocked, and this one got me. Hats off, Isaac Lee!

 

And because we’re on the subject of some of the characters that we get to meet, I really liked the Walker pilot wives: Hope, Addison, and Alyssa. They were a lot of fun and extremely likable. I normally hate the enemies to lover’s trope, but in this case, it was expertly executed, and I was there for it! This was pulled off with Hope and Madeline, but it didn’t feel cheap or overdone in this instance. I also loved how his two Thurnmar wives, Addison and Alyssa, integrated into the family. It was fun to see this couple manage to work together as they were in the same fighter squadron. The rest of the men and women who made up the fighter squadron that James ended up flying with were fun as well! Their teamwork and comradery felt real and genuine in a way that makes sense for people with whom you’re trusting your very life.

 

Next, I wanted to talk about some of the technology that we got to see in this world of Dione. We saw fictional fighter planes on par with what we had during the 1940s, but the weapons weren’t as powerful. Then we saw tech being created by merging the two worlds via the Nazi/Crestian Project Lazurus, which was working on resurrection tech. Felt like scientific necromancy, but it was fun to conceptualize. And even better, the psychological consequences of this meant the person had a tendency to go insane. Then there were the hints that the Citadel, the Thurnmar military headquarters, was working on their own top-secret military tech innovations. We saw the potential when they recreated the P-51 Mustang by taking apart the plane James arrived in. This angle feels like it’ll keep getting better in later books and I can’t wait!

 

Finally, we should talk about the prose in this story. The author knows how to string words together and make them sing. The wording was a perfect balance between flowery and purple prose with just enough workman-like storytelling to keep you on your toes. The author didn’t whip out a thesaurus; it just felt like he merely has a good vocabulary and it showed in this book. This was made perfectly clear in how the sex scenes were written. It was written in simple terms, allowing you to just luxuriate in the moment. However, during the world-building scenes, you see some flowery descriptions of the setting. A good balance, which I loved. Last thought on this topic, on the writing side I also thought the author paced the story to perfection. It kept the story moving along without losing you in the minutia, exactly how it should be done!

 

Anyway, I’ve taken up enough of your time! So, let me wrap this up by saying that I really loved this novel. The story was so much fun to listen to that the time flew by. I listened to it during my daily walk, and I was shocked when the story was over. On the fortuitous side, this novel added 2,000 steps on the days that I was listening. Happier and healthier is the way to go, ensuring that I live to listen to Wings & Tails Book 1,000!! If you can’t tell, I’ve been jonesing for book three! I know that it’s currently available for readers over on Isaac’s Patreon, but I want the next audiobook like yesterday! I want this next book so badly that I’ll have to decide if I wait for the audiobook or break out my Kindle and read it that way when it launches. I’ll be following this story because I’m seriously hooked on this Dionian adventure. But don’t take my word for it; you should read it too! Do it, or the beastkin Nazis win!

 

As we close, I’d like to request that if you loved this book too, go over to Amazon and leave a review. This is a small thing, but it really does help the authors find visibility. Since I’m hooked on this genre, I want the creators I’m growing to love to be able to give us more of this literary crack that’s piped straight into my earholes!

**Summary**

***The skies are vast and filled with enemies, and I’ve got them in my crosshairs.***

 

*Rest and relaxation don’t last forever. A little bird has arrived with a special mission for me and my team. It’s a job only we can handle.*

 

*We must return to the site of our previous battle to search for intel and technology, but the Empire will do everything they can to stop us.*

 

*Even if it means hunting us to the edge of the world.*

 

*I’m back in the sky where I belong, flying head-first toward danger. Thankfully, I’m not alone. There’s a beautiful wolf, lion, and squirrel girl keeping me company, both in the sky and in my cabin.*

 

*Old enemies, and old flames, stand in my way. Once I clear one obstacle, another appears to thwart me.*

 

***I’m pushing myself to the limits to protect those I love. My minder abilities continue to expand, and a mysterious voice guides me to new limits. I need to surpass them all so I can see tomorrow, and continue my push for one hundred kills.***

 

The summary by the author was spot on! He gave us a hint of what to expect, showed his authorial tone, and generally made me want to read this book. The kick-ass cover helped, but the blurb sold it for me. Plus, like I said in the introduction, it was the sequel to a book that I loved!

 

 

**Characters**

The premise alone made this a fun story, but really hit the ball out of the park were the characters in this novel. This novel is told through the eyes of the main character, Captain Walker. We did get a few brief glimpses through the eyes of other characters, but they were the exception to the larger story. While James was the main point of view character, the other players in this novel felt fleshed out, too! Everyone felt like they could walk off the page and join me for a cold beer or piping hot coffee. I say that about the cast of characters all the time because it’s important and very often a place where authors fail to fully actualize their worlds. And just because James is the main character, his love interests, his friends, and other beastkin were given the gift of life through how they were portrayed by the author.

**Captain James Walker:** He’s a US Army Air Corps fighter pilot, but he earned the status of double ace against the German Luftwaffe while he served in Great Britain’s Royal Air Corps. When he was shot down late in 1942, he was sent back to the United States. His nation wanted him to join the war effort after Japan attacked the US at Pearl Harbor. Like many Americans fighting under the flags of their allies, they came home to do their duty and lend their combat experience to the unblooded American troops. After the Pearl Harbor treachery, the allies of Imperial Japan declared war as well. That included the Third Reich, the notorious Nazi powers. From there, it was off to the races. Other American combat veterans got to rejoin the fight under their own banner. Unfortunately for James, his hero status as a double ace meant that he was considered more useful selling war bonds. He never got to fight under the American flag because, during one of his aerial demonstrations in his North American P-51 Mustang, he got sucked through some sort of rift into Dione. Once he was there, he had to pick a side in the Great War raging there. He did just that and put his skills to good use. And those skills exceed the purely martial; we learn that he is a skilled minder or mind reader. Well, among other similarly situated skills. But no spoilers. Read the book for yourself! Trust me, you’ll thank me later!

**Major Courtney “Court” Welch:** He is a wolfkin member of the Crestian Imperial Air Forces and a fighter pilot. He’s the son of a Grand Duke and lives a rich and lavish lifestyle. He goes by Court to his friends and has a harem of four for his wives. When James enters the picture, he’s about to be shot down by fighter pilots from the Thurnmar Republic, but James comes to the rescue and takes down the two pilots attacking him. In return for that debt, Court helps him adapt to a new world full of beastkin of every kind. He’s only mentioned in passing in this book, but he was a fun character, sympathetic, and loyal to his home and his canine people. I would love to see if he gets a full villain arc or a redemption story in future books.

**Agent Madeline Reynolds:** She is a minder and an agent for the Crestian Empire’s Ministry of State Secrets. She’s a shifter who appears as a foxkin, but she’s really a rabbitkin and ashamed of being one. She’s the product of her canid dad and her rabbitkin mother. Her mom served as a maid in her dad’s house and was his mistress. She’s the daughter of nobility as well, though illegitimate like I mentioned. Despite that, she’s proud to be a child of the peerage of Crestia. She has minder powers like James does and works for the Ministry of State Secrets for her government. She quickly falls in love with James, and we get to experience a whirlwind romance as she teaches him to use his minder powers. Like all of the love interests in this genre, she’s extremely beautiful and has white hair to match the color of her ears and tail. She’s in her mid-twenties, like James, and is significantly shorter than him. She barely reaches his chin, but she makes up for it with a pair of perky breasts on her lithe body. What could I add besides that she was hot? She’s slightly insane, made so by her participation in Project Lazarus under the visiting Nazis supporting the Crestian cause. During this novel, she’s tasked with bringing James back to her home and getting him to join their cause.

**Flight Captain Hope Barnett Walker:** She is a fighter pilot for the Thurnmar Republic who James shoots down during the opening engagement of book one. She is a wolfkin who didn’t join the canid nation, staying to serve the nation where she’d grown up. When the Crestian Empire attacked Tretshire and killed her parents in a raid, she joined the war effort. She became a skilled pilot and a triple ace, having taken down more than 15 enemy planes in aerial combat. She’s a feisty personality who loves deeply and is extremely loyal. She has the stereotypical dog traits, loving the head pats and being told she’s a good girl. Like all of the harem books, the women are gorgeous, and she was no exception. She has grey furry ears, a matching tail, and silver hair that curls just right to frame her face. She has average-sized breasts, a bubble butt, and a lithe body. What can I say? The author has a type. Or is it just that you have to be at peak fitness for military service? Whatever, she’s sexy and a lot of fun! Now, quick, give her a Scooby Snack, and maybe she’ll do a trick for you! But she becomes more than that, marrying James and becoming his Alpha Wife, leading his harem. When James promises to kill 100 Crestian fighters in aerial combat to prove his loyalty, she pledges to do the same.

**Lieutenant Colonel Addison Harris Walker:** She is a fighter pilot for the Thurnmar Republic and a triple ace as well. She was a famous actress who joined the Thurnmar war effort and served with honor for her nation. She’s a lionkin, who was Hope Barnett’s role model and the reason she went into the Thurnmar Air Corps. She’s a blonde, with ears and tails to match, but more of a curvaceous figure than Hope or Madeline. She leads a fighter wing on the *Astral Communion*, a carrier under the command of her brother, a naval officer. She leads the Black Lions, a fighter squadron made up of mostly women, the long period of war creating a male to female imbalance. She is also married to James, as his second wife and subordinate to Hope on the familial side. That dynamic is fun since she commands her mates on the military side of the house.

**Flight Captain Alyssa Hagarty Walker:** She is a fighter pilot for the Thurnmar Republic, who is a squirrelkin. She becomes James’ third wife and is adorably tiny, someone James describes as a “pint-sized beauty.” She is also a skilled pilot, able to hold her own against the best Crestia can throw at her. She loves to ice skate, and her mother was a skilled figure skater who taught her daughter how to skate as well.

**Deputy Director Priya Lowe:** She’s the second in command of the TIA (Thurnmar Intelligence Agency) and the deputy director. She’s an extremely powerful minder who teaches James how to use his powers. She’s a birdkin and loves to have her wings preened. She becomes James’ fourth wife and helps smooth over the drama from the contentious Operation Junk Dealer. Before the series starts, she was friends with Addison. The two worked together when Addison was on something like a USO tour, minding the stubborn starlet.

**Black Lion Squadron:** This is the aerial unit that James joins aboard the *Astral Communion*. This unit also includes Addiston, who commands it, Hope, Alyssa, Lillian, and Jayden. There might be more fighters in this squadron, but none that were named. I noticed, during the reading/listening, that there only appear to be six fighters in this unit. However, a WWII squadron had twelve, and that was the standard this book tried to use from a world-building perspective.

**TRS** ***Astral Communion*****:** This is the aircraft carrier that holds the Black Lions and is commanded by Addison’s older brother. This flying ship is where most of the stories take place since the fighter squadron is based out of the air carriers. Because of how descriptive the author is, this ship almost feels like it has its own personality, which is why it was included in this section.

 

 

**Plot and Pacing**

First, I’ll be blunt: this book was paced so well that I lost track of time and was shocked when the audiobook ended approximately 13 hours after I started it. I listened to this in three settings because I couldn’t put it down. I was hooked from word one and loved every second of it! I wanted to spend more time in this awesome world, so I pestered Isaac Lee about speeding up on the third novel in this series!

 

I loved the concept of this series, taking the cool ambiance of a World War II setting and putting it into a beastkin setting. I loved how the animal nature was incorporated into the temperament of the nations and characters. These traits lead to the nastier analog of the conflict that made up the Second World War. The Crestian Empire is a stand-in for the Third Reich, right up to their racial supremacy. To pound the point home, the Empire is working directly with a few members of the Nazi Regime. Those vile characters managed to travel to Dione much like James had. This, in turn, serves as a fun subplot for this series.

 

Next, I wanted to talk about the plotting and pacing of the combat. The author wrote compelling combat scenes. This action took into account the unpopular fact that most aerial combat is over very quickly. The pilots didn’t have unlimited gas and ammunition. This forced the pilots to get into the fight and eliminate the target as quickly as possible. If they couldn’t, the pilot had to disengage and return to base before they were sitting ducks. Like in real life, much of the flying happened before and after a battle. The action itself was intensely brief, but it was fun to read. I also liked that the protagonist’s airplanes took damage and that their side wasn’t invincible. That is important in action stories because doing otherwise means that the characters are invincible. Where’s the fun in that?

 

Moving on, this story was extremely well written, with a clear and concise plot that made sense to me. The adventure felt like there was a grand plan for the shenanigans. I don’t know if the author plots or makes it up as he goes, but it felt like he had a roadmap for this novel. Even cooler, there was just the right amount of action split up with thematic lulls where we could catch our breath and refuel our fighter planes. We get to see James’ dog fight with his enemies and then relax as he bonds with his squadron. Then the good captain gets to biblically experience his love interests, and then we’re back to the action sequences. Plus, there was political intrigue and action outside of the cockpit. It kept me hooked from start to finish, and I listened to this audiobook in two sittings. Sleep? Who needs it? Not me!

 

 

**Audiobook Quality**

I listened to the audiobook version of this novel, and it was perfectly done. I shouldn’t be surprised; it was put together by Royal Guard Publishing, and they’re constantly raising the bar on audiobook production. I truly loved hearing these two narrators read the story to me. The accents were odd but built an otherworldly vibe and didn’t grate on my ears. I quickly got used to it and even learned to appreciate it because it built the lore of the world in my mind. The performance of Evan Reed and Amber Hartt was amazeballs. Seriously, they did a phenomenal job and it was a joy to listen to! I can’t wait for the third book to reach the audiobook stores because I’m hooked!

 

 

**Sizzle Factor**

There are several romantic interludes in this book, and James has the time of his life! You will, too, when you listen to it or read the printed word. The author, Isaac Lee, wrote these scenes in plain language without losing the O-Face Factor! The moments in this book weren’t pure sex either; there was romance and intimacy. The love and lust were mixed with genuine feelings that came from the heart. I really felt like this was a romance novel that happened to have schmexy time.

 

This wasn’t a novel where there was constant sexual tension. This was a military portal fantasy, and the ongoing Great War was integral to the plot and pacing. The sex was a bonus, a gloriously hot bonus. The icing on the cake of cool WWII planes doing manly and cool things in the air. Never mind, I take it back… there was sexual tension. The aerial combat was a stand-in for sex, or so my pilot friends tell me.

 

Honestly, the sex didn’t feel like it was an afterthought. It wasn’t added to fit into the genre tropes. No, the romance and sex were lynchpins that held the plot together. The romance and intimacy were baked into the very world-building. Seriously, we had a few casual blowies, some ‘wham, bam, thank you ma’am’ scenes, and even a tryst between James and his plethora of ladies.

 

I loved reading about the group settings where James dominated his women. The power-play scenes between Hope and Addison were also fun to watch. I also enjoyed the scenes where the girls pleasured each other to make their husbands happy. It was hot, like a cat on a hot tin roof levels of sizzling, steamy fun. I’d write more, but I want to let you experience it for the first time for yourself.

 

 

**Overall**

First, I’ll throw this out there… this is the first beastkin series that I’ve read. I wasn’t sure I would be a fan, but after the first one, I was hooked. Seriously, I’m here for the crack Isaac Lee was drip-feeding me! I’m in it to win it, you might say! I loved how the author kept the characters ‘human’ side while they had an animal form. They had ears and tails and could shapeshift during a full moon. Otherwise, they were still human except for some traits from their animal side that made them a fun concept without being overdone.

 

Now, let’s address the elephant in the room… this is a military story, so the action scenes matter. The military culture felt real and lived in, sticking with what you’d expect from someone who’d been there and done that. Even cooler, the dog fights and aerial combat in this novel were well written. I could envision everything in them and was convinced that Isaac Lee had some throttle time, or at a minimum, time as an aircraft mechanic. Wrong, he is just a solid writer who did a crap ton of research. I am usually not incorrect; this was one time I did, to Isaac’s credit.

 

I loved how the author managed the pacing and blocking of the combat scenes. They were fast-paced, and yet there was never an engagement that I couldn’t picture like a movie in my head. I even did the thing where I used my hands as airplanes to maneuver them in tandem with the audiobook narrators. Maybe, allegedly, there might have been some pew-pew noises as I engaged the guns in those dog fights.

 

Moving on, this story is set in the 1940s, and James exists under the shadow of that moment in time. That dynamic, pastiche, was an ambitious setting, but Isaac Lee pulled it off. We got to experience this story through the eyes of the main character, Captain James Walker, and it was fun. He’s a World War 2 fighter pilot, a double ace, and as cocky as the day is long. Seriously, it was fun… probably too much to be legal in my home state! But you’ll dig the [shit on a shingle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipped_beef) that Isaac Lee is serving!

 

However, while the author kept the 1940s vibe throughout the story. He got it right, down to the big band scene while James was on dates with his women. The way fashion was described also fit within the cultural ambiance of the era, which made it easier to get sucked into the world of Dione. I can’t wait to see where Isaac Lee takes this adventure next! I’m so sucked into this world that I’ve been telling myself stories in this franchise. When I’m that invested, I know I’ve stumbled onto something awesome!  

 

Moving on… in the first book, we saw James, a fish out of water, and I really enjoyed that. The main character was as lost as we were, adding to the immersion. As James learned about the world of Dione, we did too. This gives him a fallible opinion, which can be fun to experience. I normally prefer stories in third person omniscient, but this is how first-person stories should be written. We saw the world through his eyes, which was a lot of fun. He viewed the world with the sensibilities of someone who was part of the Greatest Generation, and it kept things fun for the reader. But don’t worry, you don’t have to be a history nerd to enjoy this story!

 

This approach evolved, and by this sequel book we saw James as a more competent character. He becomes a man who’s in control of his destiny. He knows the players and the game. He evolves from existing and reacting into a man who grabs life by the balls and charts his own course. He’s a better pilot, natural-born leader, and husband in this book. I loved watching him grow into his role in the story and think we’re going to see bigger things as he leads Thurnmar to victory over the Crestian Empire.

 

Another aspect to consider would be the culture and temperament of the nation states involved in this story. I won’t give any spoilers, but the Crestian Empire was a rare gem of creation. It felt like the German culture around WW1, except they didn’t have a Kaiser, as far as I could tell. The canid nation-state had the tech of WW2, with some new cool stuff from the magical rare earth mineral that gave them awe-inspiring flight capacities. From the grey uniforms to the names of various things, this felt like a real nation. This is the first polity that we got to experience. I can’t give you spoilers about the big reveal, but this was masterfully done.

 

We don’t know much about Thurnmar, but I do hope that we can see more from this governing body as well. It was the next political entity that we learned about, the Thurnmar Republic being the polity that James and his crew fight for. They’re at war with Crestia because of an event reminiscent of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Instead of dying, this republic was angered at the marriage of the Crestian Grand Duke because it expanded their territory. These kinds of land expansion disputes happen, and in this instance, it felt like a perfect merger of the WW1 and WW2 motifs in a fun way. All of this made sense to me, fitting my understanding of geopolitics and my general historical nerdiness.

 

Now that we’ve covered the world, we have to talk about the characters. I don’t know how much I should say, but the big reveal with the wolf girl (Madeline) at the end of this book shocked the hell out of me. Just when I got the vibes that the empire was like that, BOOM, everything evolved again. It was caught off guard… again… I loved it. I read so much that I’m rarely shocked, and this one got me. Hats off, Isaac Lee!

 

And because we’re on the subject of some of the characters that we get to meet, I really liked the Walker pilot wives: Hope, Addison, and Alyssa. They were a lot of fun and extremely likable. I normally hate the enemies to lover’s trope, but in this case, it was expertly executed, and I was there for it! This was pulled off with Hope and Madeline, but it didn’t feel cheap or overdone in this instance. I also loved how his two Thurnmar wives, Addison and Alyssa, integrated into the family. It was fun to see this couple manage to work together as they were in the same fighter squadron. The rest of the men and women who made up the fighter squadron that James ended up flying with were fun as well! Their teamwork and comradery felt real and genuine in a way that makes sense for people with whom you’re trusting your very life.

 

Next, I wanted to talk about some of the technology that we got to see in this world of Dione. We saw fictional fighter planes on par with what we had during the 1940s, but the weapons weren’t as powerful. Then we saw tech being created by merging the two worlds via the Nazi/Crestian Project Lazurus, which was working on resurrection tech. Felt like scientific necromancy, but it was fun to conceptualize. And even better, the psychological consequences of this meant the person had a tendency to go insane. Then there were the hints that the Citadel, the Thurnmar military headquarters, was working on their own top-secret military tech innovations. We saw the potential when they recreated the P-51 Mustang by taking apart the plane James arrived in. This angle feels like it’ll keep getting better in later books and I can’t wait!

 

Finally, we should talk about the prose in this story. The author knows how to string words together and make them sing. The wording was a perfect balance between flowery and purple prose with just enough workman-like storytelling to keep you on your toes. The author didn’t whip out a thesaurus; it just felt like he merely has a good vocabulary and it showed in this book. This was made perfectly clear in how the sex scenes were written. It was written in simple terms, allowing you to just luxuriate in the moment. However, during the world-building scenes, you see some flowery descriptions of the setting. A good balance, which I loved. Last thought on this topic, on the writing side I also thought the author paced the story to perfection. It kept the story moving along without losing you in the minutia, exactly how it should be done!

 

Anyway, I’ve taken up enough of your time! So, let me wrap this up by saying that I really loved this novel. The story was so much fun to listen to that the time flew by. I listened to it during my daily walk, and I was shocked when the story was over. On the fortuitous side, this novel added 2,000 steps on the days that I was listening. Happier and healthier is the way to go, ensuring that I live to listen to Wings & Tails Book 1,000!! If you can’t tell, I’ve been jonesing for book three! I know that it’s currently available for readers over on Isaac’s Patreon, but I want the next audiobook like yesterday! I want this next book so badly that I’ll have to decide if I wait for the audiobook or break out my Kindle and read it that way when it launches. I’ll be following this story because I’m seriously hooked on this Dionian adventure. But don’t take my word for it; you should read it too! Do it, or the beastkin Nazis win!

 

As we close, I’d like to request that if you loved this book too, go over to Amazon and leave a review. This is a small thing, but it really does help the authors find visibility. Since I’m hooked on this genre, I want the creators I’m growing to love to be able to give us more of this literary crack that’s piped straight into my earholes!

**Summary**

***The skies are vast and filled with enemies, and I’ve got them in my crosshairs.***

 

*Rest and relaxation don’t last forever. A little bird has arrived with a special mission for me and my team. It’s a job only we can handle.*

 

*We must return to the site of our previous battle to search for intel and technology, but the Empire will do everything they can to stop us.*

 

*Even if it means hunting us to the edge of the world.*

 

*I’m back in the sky where I belong, flying head-first toward danger. Thankfully, I’m not alone. There’s a beautiful wolf, lion, and squirrel girl keeping me company, both in the sky and in my cabin.*

 

*Old enemies, and old flames, stand in my way. Once I clear one obstacle, another appears to thwart me.*

 

***I’m pushing myself to the limits to protect those I love. My minder abilities continue to expand, and a mysterious voice guides me to new limits. I need to surpass them all so I can see tomorrow, and continue my push for one hundred kills.***

 

The summary by the author was spot on! He gave us a hint of what to expect, showed his authorial tone, and generally made me want to read this book. The kick-ass cover helped, but the blurb sold it for me. Plus, like I said in the introduction, it was the sequel to a book that I loved!

 

 

**Characters**

The premise alone made this a fun story, but really hit the ball out of the park were the characters in this novel. This novel is told through the eyes of the main character, Captain Walker. We did get a few brief glimpses through the eyes of other characters, but they were the exception to the larger story. While James was the main point of view character, the other players in this novel felt fleshed out, too! Everyone felt like they could walk off the page and join me for a cold beer or piping hot coffee. I say that about the cast of characters all the time because it’s important and very often a place where authors fail to fully actualize their worlds. And just because James is the main character, his love interests, his friends, and other beastkin were given the gift of life through how they were portrayed by the author.

**Captain James Walker:** He’s a US Army Air Corps fighter pilot, but he earned the status of double ace against the German Luftwaffe while he served in Great Britain’s Royal Air Corps. When he was shot down late in 1942, he was sent back to the United States. His nation wanted him to join the war effort after Japan attacked the US at Pearl Harbor. Like many Americans fighting under the flags of their allies, they came home to do their duty and lend their combat experience to the unblooded American troops. After the Pearl Harbor treachery, the allies of Imperial Japan declared war as well. That included the Third Reich, the notorious Nazi powers. From there, it was off to the races. Other American combat veterans got to rejoin the fight under their own banner. Unfortunately for James, his hero status as a double ace meant that he was considered more useful selling war bonds. He never got to fight under the American flag because, during one of his aerial demonstrations in his North American P-51 Mustang, he got sucked through some sort of rift into Dione. Once he was there, he had to pick a side in the Great War raging there. He did just that and put his skills to good use. And those skills exceed the purely martial; we learn that he is a skilled minder or mind reader. Well, among other similarly situated skills. But no spoilers. Read the book for yourself! Trust me, you’ll thank me later!

**Major Courtney “Court” Welch:** He is a wolfkin member of the Crestian Imperial Air Forces and a fighter pilot. He’s the son of a Grand Duke and lives a rich and lavish lifestyle. He goes by Court to his friends and has a harem of four for his wives. When James enters the picture, he’s about to be shot down by fighter pilots from the Thurnmar Republic, but James comes to the rescue and takes down the two pilots attacking him. In return for that debt, Court helps him adapt to a new world full of beastkin of every kind. He’s only mentioned in passing in this book, but he was a fun character, sympathetic, and loyal to his home and his canine people. I would love to see if he gets a full villain arc or a redemption story in future books.

**Agent Madeline Reynolds:** She is a minder and an agent for the Crestian Empire’s Ministry of State Secrets. She’s a shifter who appears as a foxkin, but she’s really a rabbitkin and ashamed of being one. She’s the product of her canid dad and her rabbitkin mother. Her mom served as a maid in her dad’s house and was his mistress. She’s the daughter of nobility as well, though illegitimate like I mentioned. Despite that, she’s proud to be a child of the peerage of Crestia. She has minder powers like James does and works for the Ministry of State Secrets for her government. She quickly falls in love with James, and we get to experience a whirlwind romance as she teaches him to use his minder powers. Like all of the love interests in this genre, she’s extremely beautiful and has white hair to match the color of her ears and tail. She’s in her mid-twenties, like James, and is significantly shorter than him. She barely reaches his chin, but she makes up for it with a pair of perky breasts on her lithe body. What could I add besides that she was hot? She’s slightly insane, made so by her participation in Project Lazarus under the visiting Nazis supporting the Crestian cause. During this novel, she’s tasked with bringing James back to her home and getting him to join their cause.

**Flight Captain Hope Barnett Walker:** She is a fighter pilot for the Thurnmar Republic who James shoots down during the opening engagement of book one. She is a wolfkin who didn’t join the canid nation, staying to serve the nation where she’d grown up. When the Crestian Empire attacked Tretshire and killed her parents in a raid, she joined the war effort. She became a skilled pilot and a triple ace, having taken down more than 15 enemy planes in aerial combat. She’s a feisty personality who loves deeply and is extremely loyal. She has the stereotypical dog traits, loving the head pats and being told she’s a good girl. Like all of the harem books, the women are gorgeous, and she was no exception. She has grey furry ears, a matching tail, and silver hair that curls just right to frame her face. She has average-sized breasts, a bubble butt, and a lithe body. What can I say? The author has a type. Or is it just that you have to be at peak fitness for military service? Whatever, she’s sexy and a lot of fun! Now, quick, give her a Scooby Snack, and maybe she’ll do a trick for you! But she becomes more than that, marrying James and becoming his Alpha Wife, leading his harem. When James promises to kill 100 Crestian fighters in aerial combat to prove his loyalty, she pledges to do the same.

**Lieutenant Colonel Addison Harris Walker:** She is a fighter pilot for the Thurnmar Republic and a triple ace as well. She was a famous actress who joined the Thurnmar war effort and served with honor for her nation. She’s a lionkin, who was Hope Barnett’s role model and the reason she went into the Thurnmar Air Corps. She’s a blonde, with ears and tails to match, but more of a curvaceous figure than Hope or Madeline. She leads a fighter wing on the *Astral Communion*, a carrier under the command of her brother, a naval officer. She leads the Black Lions, a fighter squadron made up of mostly women, the long period of war creating a male to female imbalance. She is also married to James, as his second wife and subordinate to Hope on the familial side. That dynamic is fun since she commands her mates on the military side of the house.

**Flight Captain Alyssa Hagarty Walker:** She is a fighter pilot for the Thurnmar Republic, who is a squirrelkin. She becomes James’ third wife and is adorably tiny, someone James describes as a “pint-sized beauty.” She is also a skilled pilot, able to hold her own against the best Crestia can throw at her. She loves to ice skate, and her mother was a skilled figure skater who taught her daughter how to skate as well.

**Deputy Director Priya Lowe:** She’s the second in command of the TIA (Thurnmar Intelligence Agency) and the deputy director. She’s an extremely powerful minder who teaches James how to use his powers. She’s a birdkin and loves to have her wings preened. She becomes James’ fourth wife and helps smooth over the drama from the contentious Operation Junk Dealer. Before the series starts, she was friends with Addison. The two worked together when Addison was on something like a USO tour, minding the stubborn starlet.

**Black Lion Squadron:** This is the aerial unit that James joins aboard the *Astral Communion*. This unit also includes Addiston, who commands it, Hope, Alyssa, Lillian, and Jayden. There might be more fighters in this squadron, but none that were named. I noticed, during the reading/listening, that there only appear to be six fighters in this unit. However, a WWII squadron had twelve, and that was the standard this book tried to use from a world-building perspective.

**TRS** ***Astral Communion*****:** This is the aircraft carrier that holds the Black Lions and is commanded by Addison’s older brother. This flying ship is where most of the stories take place since the fighter squadron is based out of the air carriers. Because of how descriptive the author is, this ship almost feels like it has its own personality, which is why it was included in this section.

 

 

**Plot and Pacing**

First, I’ll be blunt: this book was paced so well that I lost track of time and was shocked when the audiobook ended approximately 13 hours after I started it. I listened to this in three settings because I couldn’t put it down. I was hooked from word one and loved every second of it! I wanted to spend more time in this awesome world, so I pestered Isaac Lee about speeding up on the third novel in this series!

 

I loved the concept of this series, taking the cool ambiance of a World War II setting and putting it into a beastkin setting. I loved how the animal nature was incorporated into the temperament of the nations and characters. These traits lead to the nastier analog of the conflict that made up the Second World War. The Crestian Empire is a stand-in for the Third Reich, right up to their racial supremacy. To pound the point home, the Empire is working directly with a few members of the Nazi Regime. Those vile characters managed to travel to Dione much like James had. This, in turn, serves as a fun subplot for this series.

 

Next, I wanted to talk about the plotting and pacing of the combat. The author wrote compelling combat scenes. This action took into account the unpopular fact that most aerial combat is over very quickly. The pilots didn’t have unlimited gas and ammunition. This forced the pilots to get into the fight and eliminate the target as quickly as possible. If they couldn’t, the pilot had to disengage and return to base before they were sitting ducks. Like in real life, much of the flying happened before and after a battle. The action itself was intensely brief, but it was fun to read. I also liked that the protagonist’s airplanes took damage and that their side wasn’t invincible. That is important in action stories because doing otherwise means that the characters are invincible. Where’s the fun in that?

 

Moving on, this story was extremely well written, with a clear and concise plot that made sense to me. The adventure felt like there was a grand plan for the shenanigans. I don’t know if the author plots or makes it up as he goes, but it felt like he had a roadmap for this novel. Even cooler, there was just the right amount of action split up with thematic lulls where we could catch our breath and refuel our fighter planes. We get to see James’ dog fight with his enemies and then relax as he bonds with his squadron. Then the good captain gets to biblically experience his love interests, and then we’re back to the action sequences. Plus, there was political intrigue and action outside of the cockpit. It kept me hooked from start to finish, and I listened to this audiobook in two sittings. Sleep? Who needs it? Not me!

 

 

**Audiobook Quality**

I listened to the audiobook version of this novel, and it was perfectly done. I shouldn’t be surprised; it was put together by Royal Guard Publishing, and they’re constantly raising the bar on audiobook production. I truly loved hearing these two narrators read the story to me. The accents were odd but built an otherworldly vibe and didn’t grate on my ears. I quickly got used to it and even learned to appreciate it because it built the lore of the world in my mind. The performance of Evan Reed and Amber Hartt was amazeballs. Seriously, they did a phenomenal job and it was a joy to listen to! I can’t wait for the third book to reach the audiobook stores because I’m hooked!

 

 

**Sizzle Factor**

There are several romantic interludes in this book, and James has the time of his life! You will, too, when you listen to it or read the printed word. The author, Isaac Lee, wrote these scenes in plain language without losing the O-Face Factor! The moments in this book weren’t pure sex either; there was romance and intimacy. The love and lust were mixed with genuine feelings that came from the heart. I really felt like this was a romance novel that happened to have schmexy time.

 

This wasn’t a novel where there was constant sexual tension. This was a military portal fantasy, and the ongoing Great War was integral to the plot and pacing. The sex was a bonus, a gloriously hot bonus. The icing on the cake of cool WWII planes doing manly and cool things in the air. Never mind, I take it back… there was sexual tension. The aerial combat was a stand-in for sex, or so my pilot friends tell me.

 

Honestly, the sex didn’t feel like it was an afterthought. It wasn’t added to fit into the genre tropes. No, the romance and sex were lynchpins that held the plot together. The romance and intimacy were baked into the very world-building. Seriously, we had a few casual blowies, some ‘wham, bam, thank you ma’am’ scenes, and even a tryst between James and his plethora of ladies.

 

I loved reading about the group settings where James dominated his women. The power-play scenes between Hope and Addison were also fun to watch. I also enjoyed the scenes where the girls pleasured each other to make their husbands happy. It was hot, like a cat on a hot tin roof levels of sizzling, steamy fun. I’d write more, but I want to let you experience it for the first time for yourself.

 

 

**Overall**

First, I’ll throw this out there… this is the first beastkin series that I’ve read. I wasn’t sure I would be a fan, but after the first one, I was hooked. Seriously, I’m here for the crack Isaac Lee was drip-feeding me! I’m in it to win it, you might say! I loved how the author kept the characters ‘human’ side while they had an animal form. They had ears and tails and could shapeshift during a full moon. Otherwise, they were still human except for some traits from their animal side that made them a fun concept without being overdone.

 

Now, let’s address the elephant in the room… this is a military story, so the action scenes matter. The military culture felt real and lived in, sticking with what you’d expect from someone who’d been there and done that. Even cooler, the dog fights and aerial combat in this novel were well written. I could envision everything in them and was convinced that Isaac Lee had some throttle time, or at a minimum, time as an aircraft mechanic. Wrong, he is just a solid writer who did a crap ton of research. I am usually not incorrect; this was one time I did, to Isaac’s credit.

 

I loved how the author managed the pacing and blocking of the combat scenes. They were fast-paced, and yet there was never an engagement that I couldn’t picture like a movie in my head. I even did the thing where I used my hands as airplanes to maneuver them in tandem with the audiobook narrators. Maybe, allegedly, there might have been some pew-pew noises as I engaged the guns in those dog fights.

 

Moving on, this story is set in the 1940s, and James exists under the shadow of that moment in time. That dynamic, pastiche, was an ambitious setting, but Isaac Lee pulled it off. We got to experience this story through the eyes of the main character, Captain James Walker, and it was fun. He’s a World War 2 fighter pilot, a double ace, and as cocky as the day is long. Seriously, it was fun… probably too much to be legal in my home state! But you’ll dig the [shit on a shingle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipped_beef) that Isaac Lee is serving!

 

However, while the author kept the 1940s vibe throughout the story. He got it right, down to the big band scene while James was on dates with his women. The way fashion was described also fit within the cultural ambiance of the era, which made it easier to get sucked into the world of Dione. I can’t wait to see where Isaac Lee takes this adventure next! I’m so sucked into this world that I’ve been telling myself stories in this franchise. When I’m that invested, I know I’ve stumbled onto something awesome!  

 

Moving on… in the first book, we saw James, a fish out of water, and I really enjoyed that. The main character was as lost as we were, adding to the immersion. As James learned about the world of Dione, we did too. This gives him a fallible opinion, which can be fun to experience. I normally prefer stories in third person omniscient, but this is how first-person stories should be written. We saw the world through his eyes, which was a lot of fun. He viewed the world with the sensibilities of someone who was part of the Greatest Generation, and it kept things fun for the reader. But don’t worry, you don’t have to be a history nerd to enjoy this story!

 

This approach evolved, and by this sequel book we saw James as a more competent character. He becomes a man who’s in control of his destiny. He knows the players and the game. He evolves from existing and reacting into a man who grabs life by the balls and charts his own course. He’s a better pilot, natural-born leader, and husband in this book. I loved watching him grow into his role in the story and think we’re going to see bigger things as he leads Thurnmar to victory over the Crestian Empire.

 

Another aspect to consider would be the culture and temperament of the nation states involved in this story. I won’t give any spoilers, but the Crestian Empire was a rare gem of creation. It felt like the German culture around WW1, except they didn’t have a Kaiser, as far as I could tell. The canid nation-state had the tech of WW2, with some new cool stuff from the magical rare earth mineral that gave them awe-inspiring flight capacities. From the grey uniforms to the names of various things, this felt like a real nation. This is the first polity that we got to experience. I can’t give you spoilers about the big reveal, but this was masterfully done.

 

We don’t know much about Thurnmar, but I do hope that we can see more from this governing body as well. It was the next political entity that we learned about, the Thurnmar Republic being the polity that James and his crew fight for. They’re at war with Crestia because of an event reminiscent of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. Instead of dying, this republic was angered at the marriage of the Crestian Grand Duke because it expanded their territory. These kinds of land expansion disputes happen, and in this instance, it felt like a perfect merger of the WW1 and WW2 motifs in a fun way. All of this made sense to me, fitting my understanding of geopolitics and my general historical nerdiness.

 

Now that we’ve covered the world, we have to talk about the characters. I don’t know how much I should say, but the big reveal with the wolf girl (Madeline) at the end of this book shocked the hell out of me. Just when I got the vibes that the empire was like that, BOOM, everything evolved again. It was caught off guard… again… I loved it. I read so much that I’m rarely shocked, and this one got me. Hats off, Isaac Lee!

 

And because we’re on the subject of some of the characters that we get to meet, I really liked the Walker pilot wives: Hope, Addison, and Alyssa. They were a lot of fun and extremely likable. I normally hate the enemies to lover’s trope, but in this case, it was expertly executed, and I was there for it! This was pulled off with Hope and Madeline, but it didn’t feel cheap or overdone in this instance. I also loved how his two Thurnmar wives, Addison and Alyssa, integrated into the family. It was fun to see this couple manage to work together as they were in the same fighter squadron. The rest of the men and women who made up the fighter squadron that James ended up flying with were fun as well! Their teamwork and comradery felt real and genuine in a way that makes sense for people with whom you’re trusting your very life.

 

Next, I wanted to talk about some of the technology that we got to see in this world of Dione. We saw fictional fighter planes on par with what we had during the 1940s, but the weapons weren’t as powerful. Then we saw tech being created by merging the two worlds via the Nazi/Crestian Project Lazurus, which was working on resurrection tech. Felt like scientific necromancy, but it was fun to conceptualize. And even better, the psychological consequences of this meant the person had a tendency to go insane. Then there were the hints that the Citadel, the Thurnmar military headquarters, was working on their own top-secret military tech innovations. We saw the potential when they recreated the P-51 Mustang by taking apart the plane James arrived in. This angle feels like it’ll keep getting better in later books and I can’t wait!

 

Finally, we should talk about the prose in this story. The author knows how to string words together and make them sing. The wording was a perfect balance between flowery and purple prose with just enough workman-like storytelling to keep you on your toes. The author didn’t whip out a thesaurus; it just felt like he merely has a good vocabulary and it showed in this book. This was made perfectly clear in how the sex scenes were written. It was written in simple terms, allowing you to just luxuriate in the moment. However, during the world-building scenes, you see some flowery descriptions of the setting. A good balance, which I loved. Last thought on this topic, on the writing side I also thought the author paced the story to perfection. It kept the story moving along without losing you in the minutia, exactly how it should be done!

 

Anyway, I’ve taken up enough of your time! So, let me wrap this up by saying that I really loved this novel. The story was so much fun to listen to that the time flew by. I listened to it during my daily walk, and I was shocked when the story was over. On the fortuitous side, this novel added 2,000 steps on the days that I was listening. Happier and healthier is the way to go, ensuring that I live to listen to Wings & Tails Book 1,000!! If you can’t tell, I’ve been jonesing for book three! I know that it’s currently available for readers over on Isaac’s Patreon, but I want the next audiobook like yesterday! I want this next book so badly that I’ll have to decide if I wait for the audiobook or break out my Kindle and read it that way when it launches. I’ll be following this story because I’m seriously hooked on this Dionian adventure. But don’t take my word for it; you should read it too! Do it, or the beastkin Nazis win!

 

As we close, I’d like to request that if you loved this book too, go over to Amazon and leave a review. This is a small thing, but it really does help the authors find visibility. Since I’m hooked on this genre, I want the creators I’m growing to love to be able to give us more of this literary crack that’s piped straight into my earholes!

1goi1qu,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1goi1qu/flat_burrs_for_decaf_dark_roasts/,Flat burrs for decaf dark roasts?,"After an insane amount of research on this topic , the general guidance seems to be:

1. DF54 (flat burr) is the best grinder under $300, and is waaaay better than Fellow Opus (conical burr).
2. Flat burrs are for lighter roasts, emphasizing clarity.
3. Conical burrs are for darker roasts, emphasizing body.
4. The DF54 might not be best for pour over (course ground).

This puts me in a predicament since I only like medium/dark roasts with lots of body, but I'd like to have the best grinder on the market in my price range. I've been using Tetsu Kasuya's  Hario Switch Recipe with fresh roasted Temple Coffee Decaf Espresso Blend beans (I love coffee but I had to quit caffeine recently) ground in the DF54, and the resulting drink tastes like a cup of Folgers brewed in a $20 coffee machine at grandma's house.

We talk a little bit but we’re not like close friends or anything, though we have hung out a few times doing stuff like spontaneous coffee trips etc. 

Today we went to the mall, it wasn’t a date but more just casual two friends chilling. I would say we had a good time but there wasn’t really a “flirty” vibe between the two of us. I say she’s moving towards me because when I was talking to her about going to the mall she said something about how we need to go to Starbucks and try the Christmas coffee flavors sometime, so that’s a plus. 

I’m not getting the vibe she’s into me on a romantic level though. Plus, occasionally she will miss my messages, though she told me once that she saw my messages but she got sidetracked whilst replying. I’m not in love with her, but should I just go full no contact and just go on my winter arc, or is keeping her around an option so long as I realize it will never lead to anything serious?

Try to avoid de-gassing when scoring; something that can help is scoring after 5 minutes of bake time.

1. The Stew Crew is becoming homogenized right before our very eyes. Their content is heavily curated these days and every event is used multiple times for promotion, links , stories and reels. By the time the weekly Vlog comes out… It’s all just a rerun of what content they have pushed out all week. Carlin lives for her mirror Sundays, where the whole family shows off their newest outfit and the camera trains in on Layla, who is a professional at throwing faces. She is at the top of her class at influencer elementary.  After mentioning last week that she and Whitney are never at their shop, this week Carlin shows up for one day and films a ton of content that the boutique rolls out all week. She really wants you to buy her $50 throw blankets and her $75 pants. We know they are not there every day because one of the salespeople mentions that the whole team is there today. There is no way she could be at the boutique every day because how would she possibly have time to film all of her content with Evan? This week they went to Gatlinburg to see the leaves, to Dollywood, to Disney on ice and a Tennessee football game.  While everyone else in the world was following the election, the Stewarts bypass it all and instead give us Evan selling cologne in their otherwise unused kitchen and film Layla in church. They don’t have to mention the election because we all already know how they voted. It’s just a shame that they won’t say it with their chest… They are not about to mess up a check.  It was Zade’s turn to clock in this week and he is fully exploited at his pediatrician check up. He is finally getting a two year check up because Carlin and Evan have a new pediatrician. They spend way too much time convincing us that he doesn’t need speech therapy only to tell us at the end that he is going to have a speech evaluation. The poor kid gets absolutely no privacy because they feature him riding the electric bicycle around town with Carlin and stick the camera in his face while he watches Disney on ice. No one knows what the hell he is saying except the two of them… And let’s be honest… Layla is about to turn five and she isn’t all that clear either.  While they are at Disney on ice celebrating Khloe‘s birthday, Evan says Carlin has never been to anything like this because she has to live her childhood through her children. Such a condescending ass… he says all of that to her, but he’s the one running around in Mickey Mouse ears screaming at the camera about how absolutely exciting this is. The lowest point of the week came when Carlin featured a reel of Layla eating/licking cotton candy and one just has to wonder… Who is she really making this content for? The Stewarts attend a football game with Josie and Kelton as invited guests of the University of Tennessee. I hope the University knows they would never attend that school or allow any of their children to go there… but go sports! Carlin is in a mini skirt and a T-shirt and someone comments that her outfit is hideous. Lots of folks think she is pregnant… But she was drinking a sugar-free monster at the game.  

2.  Josie Balka forgot that she is selling and promoting baby formula and featured a “get ready with me” for a Tennessee football game where she loads her breast pump up into her clear bag. Lydia and Trace go with them to the game and Lydia is in leggings and a T-shirt while Josie looks like she is ready for the club. We also get a “get ready with me” for church the next day where the girls’ hair is jerked into a ponytail and the rest is all Josie primping for the camera while Kelton and his apron are in the kitchen, smoking a pot of chili.  Kelton has to leave town on a work trip so he brings over all of the Balka cousins to watch over Josie while he is away. Josie loads them all up and heads to the mall, the nail salon and then it’s back home where she forces all of them Into pool noodles. She says this is a night with the girlies and someone needs to remind her that she’s a mom of three. She is obviously having an identity crisis where she doesn’t know if she is Brat or if she is Ballerina farm.  Josie also manages not to talk politics all week… And in her vapid, whispery world…the election never happened. Kelton makes it back to town just in time to head out to yet another Tennessee football game. This time the Balkas make it on the sidelines with the Stew crew. Kelton tries to act goofy like Evan, but it just lays flat. The Effortless shop continues to feature micro influencers in pool noodles. You have to wonder if in 2025 women are going to start making TikToks about their receding hairlines. A class action lawsuit could be in her future…

3. The Clark family must be feeling the burn of two under two because things were relatively quiet this week with no new Vlog. They pretended an election was not happening and instead made a reel of a family painting project. Katie showed off a $75 dress from the Bates Sisters boutique and paired it with boots she said were a gift fromCarlin. Turns out they were from Shein… Gee, thanks sis.  Katie is promoting the weighted sleep sack and is putting her newborn in one, even though they are not pediatrician recommended.  Between that and being strapped into his rotating bassinet… all Harvey CAN do is sleep! Katie and Travis venture out to Dollywood with Katie wearing baby Harvey. Someone must think she should be at home because they spend a lot of time explaining why it is OK for them to be there. Guess what Katie, it’s also OK for you to stay at home with your newborn and rest and heal …. Let your husband come up with some content since this is what HE wants to do. 

4.  Big, exciting things are happening in WebsterLand… Alyssa takes her children to a coffee shop and allows them to spend their money and order their own drinks. Unfortunately two girls have to share one small drink. Mom, of course, gets her very own jumbo coffee. They take their liquid sugar to the deserted park so Alyssa can film Rhett frowning while sliding down a slide and tell us all how fun it is. Allie seems to be in charge of Rhett in the car and at the park. Over on her business page, she has lost over 100 followers. She puts the sad hats on sale for 30% off and exactly one adult hat is either sold or… maybe John needed a new one.  We see Jeremiah Duggar, and his wife and kids in the hats, but surprisingly, that does not cause a rush of sales.  Back at home Alyssa locks herself in the baby’s room with Rhett to sell pajamas. You can tell she is forcing herself to sound happy and excited and loud. Rhett tries to lock himself in his closet. He’s terrified of fake happy mom or either he saw the filter that she is putting on his face.  Alyssa does not shy away from the election and shows the whole family at Taliban Dan’s reelection party. The next day she says it is a very good day. Coincidentally, that also does not cause a rush of sales in her sad hat store. For her 30th birthday, Allie is allowed to bake her a cake and the girls decorate the table and make her a card where Lexi calls her “mother”. Very Joan Crawford-like Lexi! John is totally absent from her Vlog and her social media in general, but we do see that he took her out for the night with a bunch of super young couples from their church. Alyssa says she is going to answer 30 questions for her 30th birthday however, if she does not like the question she won’t answer it no kidding, tell us something we don’t know. One of her girlfriends comes over to read her the questions and Alyssa sits alone with her coffee and answers them expressionless. She says at the beginning that she plans to be as vague as possible and I don’t think she knows what vague means… Or maybe she does. In any case, we find out that she and John have been talking about baby number six… She says that after taking all of her children out to dinner, she changed her mind. I’m left wondering again… What is going on with these kids when they are in public? Other notable things she says… She does not listen to online criticism…which we know, because if she did, she would lay off the cartoon filters. She is only interested in her kids going to college if they have some idea of what they want to be when they grow up. This is such a ridiculous thing to say because college is where you go to figure that out. Alyssa tells us that she does not get along with all 18of her siblings, and once again mentions that people grow up and get married and change. I wonder which in law she can’t stand?? She does say she is planning a trip to Tennessee at Christmas time…maybe.  I had to chuckle when she totally downplayed CheerfullyU and said she has no plans to feature any other products and it was always just a hobby and just something to do on the side…. like so much with Alyssa…the story just doesn’t add up.  She only gets birthday wishes from KellyJoe, Carlin and Esther.

5.  Erin Paine is back to save your life with clean eating. This week she has set up shop in what appears to be a new filming location. She is a one woman show with a cafeteria table, and a blender with no lid. Baby Finney is there to suck on strawberries and fling hair around while Erin makes a smoothie. She puts nothing fun in the smoothie, serves it to her children one at a time while pestering them to tell her what it tastes like. I am pretty sure Brookie said it tastes like poop… But Erin dubbed the video so it sounded like blueberry instead.

6. Whitney Bates showed up at her boutique to film content with Carlin and then headed out to celebrate Khloe‘s fifth birthday.  She takes her older kids to Disney on ice with Carlin and Evan. Zach was obviously busy… Evan never is.  In the Bates kitchen this week…No one is cooking. Instead, Zach answers questions with Kelly Joe. This is her fourth appearance on the show and I have to wonder if she is going to be his new cohost. Zach talks a lot and Kelly Joe fights to get a word in edgewise. We find out that when they landed the show… They ate out a lot, and now that they don’t have the show anymore… they cook at home. They talk a lot about other people’s cooking but they don’t show any pictures so it’s just two people on barstools talking. Gil Bates will turn 60 sometime during the holidays, and they are planning a huge Christmas/New Year’s/birthday celebration where they hope the entire family will be together. This is obviously the trip Alyssa is thinking about making. Zach tells us that there are more grandbabies to come because he gets notifications on his phone with news that is not yet public. Kelly Joe looks thrilled. The only thing she likes more than macaroni and cheese is a new pregnancy.

7. Michael and Brandon have Tori’s daughters over to exploit this week. The little girls paint animal figurines while smiling at Brandon behind the camera and that’s it… That’s all there is …just two little girls painting.

8. Trace Bates left his wife and child for eight days to go on a Colorado hunting expedition. Only…Trace is not hunting on this trip… So basically he ran away. While he is gone, Lydia drops Ryker off with her parents for a few days… She says it so she can get her work done and because they haven’t seen him in so long. I guess the 10 days they were gone three weeks ago doesn’t count.  Lydia is left to promote their Vlog sponsor all on her own. It is those pukey frozen microwave meals, and it looks exactly the same frozen or cooked… Gray and gross. Lydia doesn’t even pretend to eat it. She takes Ryker to the zoo and hangs out with her parents. Trace shows nothing of Colorado except his mug in front of the camera. I guess he made it back home and went to Spain with medicCorp. He was promoting their fundraising on the medicCorp page from Spain.

9. While pretty much every other Bates shied away from election coverage… Tiffy and Lawson decided to jump in head first. I refuse to report on the dangerous rhetoric and absolute idiocy that these two spewed all week. She tried to rebound by asking-once again-who her baby looks like and reminding everyone that she’s adopted… But I think for a lot of folks it was too late. Lawson got reminded over and over again in the comments about his little January 6 trip and he can do performative rescues with medicCorp for the rest of his days and people are not going to forget. When someone shows you who they are… Believe them.

10. Bits and Bytes…Renee’s Bridal is suddenly all over the Bates’ social media. She loves everything they do/post…Kelly Joe continues to evolve into a full on influencer. This week she had IG stories and grid  posts about entertaining Patch the Pirate’s Wife at Bible Baptist Church. Patch is dead, but they still had a birthday cake for him…. BSB posted a proverb about kind words being honey for your heart…no one has featured the God garage lately. The workouts seem to have slowed down.

Have a great week friends. Hell… it can’t get any worse… can it??? (Don’t answer that)

1gohvev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1gohvev/the_clown/,The Clown,"The following posts were originally found on a popular website forum and have since been removed.

*OP (06-17-21)*: Several months ago, I lost my husband after he apparently died in his sleep. I wish I could say he looked to be at peace when he died, but the look of terror on his face when I found his body would suggest otherwise.

Now, I'm no doctor and I haven't seen many dead bodies, so I assumed his ghastly expression was a normal occurrence. Something related to the muscle fibers expending their last ATP stores to cause one last final muscle contraction, a final abnormal neurological firing resulting in an odd last facial expression… but now I'm starting to think there might have been another, more ominous reason.

After months of mourning his loss, I decided it was finally time to start going through my husband’s things. To get a sense of closure. To move on with my life. Maybe even try and meet someone new. 

While going through his bedside dresser, I found a diary. He was a writer, albeit not a very good one, and I'm told this is a normal thing that writers to do. Sometimes he would have vivid dreams and would have to jot them down before they slipped his mind.

I'll relay his entries here as they're written in his diary. Knowing who he was and what he believed, I know that this is what he would have wanted; he would have wanted me to share his musings with the world, even if they fell on deaf ears. But before you read any further, there is one slight caveat I should mention. He had hundreds of entries in his diary and I read through all of them. Maybe to get a better sense of who he was, maybe because I was bored, or maybe because I just wanted to hear his voice again and reading his words allowed me to hear them. To hear him.

Regardless, most of the entries are rather mundane, lacking in inspiration or originality, but towards the end his dreams started to become more linear, almost like a TV series, with a clear protagonist and antagonist. A beginning, a middle, and an end. I’ll start relaying his entries at the beginning, or at least what I believe to be the beginning.

*Entry 1*: I'm sitting in the bleachers of my high school basketball gym. It's exactly how I remember. There are 2 sets of bleachers on each side of the court, one on the lower level and one on the upper level; I'm on the upper level. The dance team is doing some kind of performance, but I'm not really paying attention because my high school crush – we’ll call her Angelica to protect her identity and because she was like an angle to me - is sitting directly across from me; we keep making eye contact.

*OP*: I didn't know he had a crush on anyone in high school, but I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

*Entry 1 (continued)*: The dance team is finally done with their performance. I'm now standing by myself in the middle of the basketball court. The spotlight is on me. Shit. I'm still in my underwear. The entire audience is laughing at me. I turn to run, but I'm now in the middle of our football field. It's our high school graduation.

*Entry 2*: I'm back in the middle of the football field, but now I have pants on (thank God) along with my cap and gown. Our entire graduating class is sitting in plastic foldable chairs, all neatly laid out in the middle of the football field. Why did they make us sit out here for our graduation in the middle of summer? Anyway, the valedictorian is in the middle of a commencement speech. 

And now the valedictorian – initially an archetypal Poindexter, complete with braces, glasses, freckles and a pocket protector – has transformed into Angelica because of course that would happen. I can't stop staring into her eyes and I barely process what she’s saying. Why can't I stop staring? Does she wear contacts or are her eyes really that captivating?

Angelica stops in middle of her speech and fiddles with the microphone. There doesn't seem to be any sound coming from it. I never hear anything in my dreams anyway, so it's kind of weird seeing someone else in a dream react to not being able to hear themselves.

Suddenly, someone appears next to the podium where she's standing. I recognize everyone else in my dream except for this strange interloper. He leans over and whispers something to her. She nods to the mysterious guest and makes her way to her seat, which, you guessed it, is right next to me. Does that mean anything? It has to mean *something.*

The moment she sits down, the strange interloper picks up the podium and hurls it into the sky. Everyone, including me, looks up. When I look back down, the strange interloper has transformed from a pedestrian middle-aged man into a clown, complete with red curly hair, an unnerving smile and large sharp pointed teeth. I think he had eyes, but I don't remember what they looked like. Small red dots that pierce through the darkness? Or maybe they were large, yellow and lifeless… eyes the size of dinner plates that couldn’t possibly belong to anything in this reality? I’ll be sure to look more closely next time, if I have the wherewithal to remember.

Then, one of the school administrators took it upon herself to confront the clown and shoo him off the stage. As she approached, the clown’s gaze slowly shifted from the audience to the administrator. The clown’s intense gaze quickly melted her confident demeanor and she suddenly had a change of heart. Like a dog with their tail tucked between their legs, she slowly started to back away from the clown. She must have thought she was safe because she turned her back on him. Big mistake. He quickly closed the distance between them, picked her up, unhinged his jaw, and devoured her whole. I was completely speechless. And then I remembered I was in a dream.

When I woke up, I was drenched in sweat. I watched a scary movie about clowns last night, so that's probably what this clown thing is all about. To the light of my life, if you're reading this, that's why I washed the sheets. Not because I was actually trying to “be a better husband”, though I really do try.

*Entry 3*: I'm back on the football field and the clown just finished engulfing the administrator. He jumps down from the stage and begins devouring everyone in the front row, one by one. I stand up to get a better view. I can barely make out a pair of feet squirming before they disappear into the clown's grotesque mouth. I sit back down and turn to Angelica, who's still sitting next to me. She doesn't seem to be bothered at all by the atrocities happening before our eyes. In fact, no one seems bothered by the clown until they realize they’re next.

When I wake up, I'm not drenched in sweat, but my hands are sore. I think I had a death grip on my blankets while I was sleeping. I wonder how long my hands were stuck like that? I've never had nightmares of the same movie back-to-back and I've certainly never had such a visceral experience during my dreams, let alone dreams that happen in a linear fashion. How far can I take these dreams? Could these dreams be telling me something? Are they the gateway to the story that's going to make me famous? 

*Entry 4*: I'm back on the football field. The clown has finished devouring everyone in the front row, though he certainly doesn't look like he's eaten anyone because his funny little checkered vest still fits and his bow tie is still miraculously secured around his neck. I begin counting the rows between him and me.

21.

21 rows between him and me. I let out a sigh of relief.

It seems the clown heard me because once I finished sighing, he looked directly at me. Up until this point, we hadn't actually made eye contact. What’s particularly strange is that I still don’t know what his eyes looked like, despite making a conscious effort to note their appearance. Maybe there was nothing where his eyes should have been and my mind is just trying to fill in the blanks. What I did notice is that the clown’s motivation seemed to change. At first, it seemed he was causally killing the audience members, almost as if he was tasked with killing these people and was reluctant to do so – like he drew the short straw and was in charge of cleanup on aisle 4. Now it seems like he’s trying to dispose of them quickly so he can get to me faster – rushing through the entrée so he can get to desert.

I say that because after the clown looked at me, he looked at the rows between him and me, bounced a few times in his massive red shoes, and then jumped 15 feet into the air. While suspended in mid-air, he began breathing fire at the rows in front of me. Rows 2-15 were suddenly filled with nothing but charred bodies and melted chairs.

When I woke, I could have sworn I smelled burning flesh and heard the muffled sound of people screaming. The smell lasted for only moments and the sound of screaming, even less so.

*Entry 5*: I’ve only slept twice over the past four days. That’s two more dreams. Two more rows of people dead. Two fewer rows between me and that clown, or that demon, or whatever it is.

I fear falling asleep because every time I fall asleep, another row of people dies, each time more brutally than the last. I’m beginning to fear that these aren’t just dreams after all.

*Entry 7*: I don’t know how long I’ve gone without sleep. I’m trying to hold it all together and pretend like everything is fine because no one would believe me if I told them the truth. If I told them what was really happening to me.

In the last dream I had, I tried to escape. But at the end of the aisle where I’m sitting, there is a red velvet rope that acts like a force field and I can’t go past it. There’s another red velvet rope on the other side of the aisle and I can’t go past that one either. I tried jumping over my seat, but I immediately woke up. I dare not try that again because the clown is now undoubtedly at Row 19, waiting for me to drift off to sleep.

*Entry 8*: This time, my dream was different. I was still at my graduation and the rows of dead bodies were still there, but this time the clown spoke. I actually *heard* the clown speak! In a guttural voice that shook my innards, the clown said, “You can’t stay awake forever.” He then raised his right hand and decapitated everyone in row 19 with one swift movement, looking me dead in the eyes as he killed them.

I woke up in tears. This can’t be happening to me. This can’t be real. Is this some kind of prank? Am I in some kind of weird psychological experiment?

*Entry 9*: I can’t believe I fell asleep again. Row 20 is dead. My row is next. I fear that if I fall asleep again, I may never wake up.

*Entry 10*: I made it 5 days on a combination of coffee and energy drinks before my body finally crashed. I thought for sure that would be the end of me. Instead, all the clown did was calmly walk to the beginning of my aisle, lift the red velvet rope and then lower it behind him. Just before I woke up, he turned and smiled at me. What a hideous and twisted smile!

*Entry 11*: The clown slowly made his way through everyone between me and the end of the aisle. Angelica, just after realizing she was next, turned towards me and started to run but it was useless. He swiftly put his hand through her back and pulled out her pulsating heart. I watched as the life slowly drained from her eyes and the thud of her body hitting the ground woke me from my sleep. The smell of her blood, that all-too-familiar smell of metallic copper, permeated my nostrils for an entire day.

*OP (06-18-21)*: That was the last entry in his diary. I know what you’re all thinking, “How could you not have noticed something was off?” I did notice something was slightly off just before he passed, but I didn’t think much of it. He was bound to some fits of insomnia. Sometimes he “did his best writing” when he couldn’t sleep. He was also prone to consuming a lot of caffeine. A LOT of caffeine. He said it helped “free his mind and be more creative” or something like that. I don’t know if this diary is real or if it’s just some prank that he set up in the event he died young. He had kind of a weird sense of humor… Has anyone experienced anything like this before?

*OP (06-19-21)*: I just had a dream that I was at my high school graduation. We were in the middle of a football field and the valedictorian was giving a speech. If anyone has experienced anything like this, please share!

*OP (06-20-21)*: Someone please help me!!! I’m begging you!",2,1731292526.0,Creepypastastories,0,1.0,False

1gohtu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HempLovers/comments/1gohtu7/a_beginners_guide_to_hempderived_edibles/,A Beginner’s Guide to Hemp-Derived Edibles,"Hemp-derived edibles are becoming an increasingly popular choice for people looking to experience the benefits of cannabinoids in a smoke-free and convenient way. From gummies to chocolates to beverages, there’s something for everyone. If you’re new to hemp-derived edibles or just curious about how they work, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know.



**What Are Hemp-Derived Edibles?**



Hemp-derived edibles are food products infused with cannabinoids like CBD (cannabidiol), THCA, or other non-psychoactive compounds extracted from hemp. These products are made from hemp plants, which contain less than 0.3% THC, making them legal under federal law in the U.S. (check your local regulations for specifics).



Edibles come in a variety of forms:

• Gummies (a fan favorite for their flavor and ease of use)

• Chocolates and baked goods

• Beverages like teas, sodas, or coffee

• Capsules and powders



**Benefits of Hemp Edibles**



Hemp edibles offer several advantages over other consumption methods:

1. **Smoke-Free Experience**: Ideal for people who prefer to avoid smoking or vaping.

2. **Long-Lasting Effects**: While it takes longer to feel the effects, edibles typically provide a longer-lasting experience compared to inhaled methods.

3. **Discretion**: Edibles look like any other snack, making them a convenient and subtle way to consume cannabinoids.

4. **Precise Dosing**: Most edibles are pre-portioned, so you know exactly how much you’re consuming.



**How Do Edibles Work?**



When you consume hemp-derived edibles, the cannabinoids are processed through your digestive system before entering your bloodstream. This process takes longer compared to smoking or vaping, so you may not feel the effects immediately.



**Key Points to Remember:**

• **Onset Time**: Edibles can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to kick in. Be patient!

• **Duration**: The effects can last 4 to 8 hours, depending on your metabolism, dosage, and tolerance.

• **Dosing**: Start low and go slow. If you’re new, 5-10 mg of CBD or hemp-derived cannabinoids is a good starting point.



**Choosing the Right Edible**



Not all edibles are created equal. Here are a few tips to help you pick the right one:

1. **Check the Label**: Look for third-party lab testing to ensure quality and transparency.

2. **Understand Cannabinoids**: Some edibles focus on CBD for relaxation, while others may include THCA for additional benefits.

3. **Read the Ingredients**: If you have dietary restrictions, check for vegan, gluten-free, or allergen-friendly options.

4. **Flavor Preferences**: Gummies and chocolates often mask the earthy taste of hemp, making them popular for beginners.



**Tips for First-Time Users**



1. **Start Small**: Begin with a low dose, especially if you’re new to edibles. Wait at least 2 hours before deciding to take more.

2. **Be Patient**: Edibles take time to work. Avoid the mistake of consuming too much because you don’t feel immediate effects.

3. **Choose the Right Setting**: Make sure you’re in a comfortable and relaxed environment, especially if you’re trying edibles for the first time.

4. **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking water can help enhance your overall experience and prevent dry mouth.



**Common Myths About Edibles**



• **“You’ll feel effects instantly.”** Unlike smoking or vaping, edibles require digestion, so patience is key.

• **“Edibles are always mild.”** Potency can vary, so even a small amount can pack a punch, depending on the product.

• **“All edibles are the same.”** Different products use different cannabinoids and extraction methods, leading to unique effects.



**Popular Edibles to Try**



If you’re looking to explore hemp-derived edibles, here are a few common options to consider:

• **CBD Gummies**: Great for relaxation and sleep.

• **Hemp-infused drinks**: A refreshing way to consume cannabinoids.

• **Hemp Chocolates**: Perfect for those with a sweet tooth.

• **Capsules**: A no-fuss option for consistent dosing.

[Breville Bambino and DF54],"I love the taste of coffee but I had to quit caffeine. I started getting into espresso a few weeks ago. I've watched almost every Lance Hendrik and James Hoffman video on YouTube (and many others) and spent hours every day on Reddit. I've purchased everything the Internet told me to purchase, such as:

1. Breville Bambino
2. DF54
3. Fellow Opus (before I learned about DF54)
4. Greater Goods scale (I find this to be inconsistent)
5. RDT bottles
6. WDT tool
7. IMS Precision NANOTECH 22gr Filter Basket
8. Normcore bottomless portafilter
9. Normcore dosing cup, blind shaker, and dosing funnel
10. Normcore rotating distribution tool
11. Normcore self-balancing tamping tool
12. Normcore puck screen
13. Fresh roasted beans (medium and dark roast)

On one occasion, with one type of bean (Temple Coffee Decaf Espresso Blend), using the Fellow Opus, I was able to achieve 18g in : 36g out in 30s, and it was bitter. I then dialed in the same bean on the DF54 and got close to 18g in : 36g out in 30s, and it was \*okay\* (not amazing). All of the above stuff was expensive, and I've spent a crazy amount of time researching and making different espressos. I must've made at least 60 espressos by now, with various different beans and settings. My puck preparation seems pretty good (no channeling, etc.), but all of my shots just turn out crap, even when ""dialed in."" I only want to make lattes with dark (or at least medium) DECAF beans.

1gohpkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedSolutions/comments/1gohpkt/time/,Time, I haven’t posted for a whiles. For me setting around bitching and  moaning tripping on this situation I find myself in doing nothing  was very consuming. It consumed my emotionally physically and mentally. I found myself falling into the poor victim role. This is not good. The feeling of helplessness is a death sentence in so many ways.  I’ve always been a worker. Working is the number one way I fight my situation. So this is what I did.  I went to the round about where I live by Walmart and flew a sign. This is what my sign said. “Will work for cash no handouts”. I turned a lot money away the first day but at the end of the day I accepted twenty dollars bought  some coffee and smokes. The following day same thing but i did find a days worth of work. Oboy paid me twice on what we agreed then I got a call from a guy that does remodeling and I’ve been working for him ever since.  The best part of it all I’m allowed to stay in the house we’re remodeling. This is huge for me for I was homeless. Flying that sign like I did was the most humbling experience of my life.  I’m like many others trying to work in a corporate setting does not work. If i even get the job the organized harassment is to much to bare for I loose control of my emotions and it always would beat me down spiritually. I had to think outside the box to have the feeling I was at-least moving forward making the effort to move forward. I no longer allow myself to trip on right and wrong who’s worse of a person me or them how wrong everyone is about me I refuse to just set still and do nothing. There’s many of us that want to work need to work but don’t because of fear of the gauntlet we face in a work setting. So think outside the box. Go fly a sign looking for work. If it’s just a day or two weeks it don’t matter. Who knows who God may bring into your life that any bless you. Things are going pretty good right now beyond any hope I had and yes I’m always waiting for the sucker punch. If and when it happens it won’t be no surprise. It took them a few days but they now have their dew devices in one of the neighbors houses taunting me.  This is fine so what it’s all they have. Guess as long as they feel like they are getting in their punch’s and I’m feeling like I’m getting in my punch’s it’s all good. Don’t give up my brothers and sisters. We must fight but we have to fight right. ,2,1731292016.0,TargetedSolutions,0,1.0,False

And that size is the girth size of a man. I’ve been feeling really positive the last few weeks, and I feel so bad now. What man would ever want a broken woman, whose body could never accept him. What use does a man have for a woman if he can’t use her body to pleasure himself? I feel so sad, as I thought I’ve come a long way to healing, and I feel like I’m going backwards.

I started with a little pain in my behind area when I would wipe, it quickly turned into a pretty large abscess that needed to be drained. The doctor numbed it, cut it open and drained it. He was very kind and did it gently, no pain during the drainage or even afterwards during the healing. So long story short, it came back months later. I researched online and had seen a Dr in Sri Lanka was curing people with Homeopathy regimen. I decided to try it since I felt I wouldn't lose anything if I tried. (I am not a doctor, I am merely trying to help anyone who has felt what I did with this condition.) I only did the Arnica, Silicea and Simply Neosporin (applied after every bowel movement) and also followed the diet restrictions! very important!

This is the regimen in his words (Dr. Joe De Livera)

Arnica 30c in the Wet dose a capful of the bottle taken thrice daily to increase the flow of blood in the body which in turn will help to rebuild the tissue.  
Silicea 6x Dose 2 tablets taken twice daily to expel the pus from the lesion.  
Nat Phos 6x Dose 2 tablets taken twice daily after meals to soften the stools.  
Ferr Phos 6x Dose 2 tablets taken twice daily to improve the quality of the blood to help heal the lesion.  
Antibiotic Ointment like Polyfax or equivalent which is used internally on the tip of a gloved finger inserted into the anus after every bowel movement to keep the bacterial count as low as possible in the lesion.

Do not use toilet paper after a BM. Use a Hand Spray device instead available at Wal Mart which is a DIY fitting. (I used wipes to wipe and then I would shower and clean up before doing the Simply Neosporin)  
No Alcohol, Red meat, Coffee and Sausages, Ham and Bacon as they are loaded with Saltpeter. (He means Nitrites and Nitrates.)  No canned beverages like Coke. Do not eat hot (Chillie hot) food if you live in India. (THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! It made a huge difference for me, basically no spicy food AT ALL)  
Drink at least 3 ltrs water daily and exercise moderately.

STOP ALL DRUGS YOU ARE TAKING TODAY. (I am a diabetic, so I did not stop taking my metformin.)

The Wet dose of any Homeopathic remedy is made as follows:

Order the remedy in a 5ml bottle in the Liquid Dilution in Alcohol. (I could not find the alcohol version only the globules from Boiron)   
Get a 500ml bottle of Spring Water from the nearest supermarket. (I put 3 Arnica globules in a 16 ounce water bottle, dissolved them and took a capful 3 times a day.)  
Pour out about 3cm of water from the bottle to leave some airspace.  
Insert 3 drops of the remedy into the bottle and shake it hard to produce bubbles. This is homeopathic succussion and must be done every time before a capful of the bottle which is the dose is taken as directed.

Do not use Coffee, Cola beverages, preserved foods like sausages, ham and bacon as they contain Saltpeter. 

This is what helped me and I hope it helps you! <3",1,1731291268.0,AnalFistula,0,0.67,False
