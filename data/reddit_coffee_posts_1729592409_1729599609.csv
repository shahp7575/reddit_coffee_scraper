You never know what you're in for when hearing a lot of praise in forums like this (and Japan travel subs), but happy to say they are LEGIT and absolutely worthy of the hype!

I had a cortado, double espresso and a cappuccino all made with different bean varieties (the latter for the wife who just let me drink it because she was amazed at how much I was nerding out). The cap was very good, but wow, the espresso and cortado were out of this world - literally the best versions of those drinks I have ever had! The layers of flavour and nuance they are getting from their pulls is some kind of coffee sorcery. The experience has completely changed my perception of what is possible from espresso.

Anyway, just thought I'd share! If you are ever visiting Japan, please do your tastebuds a favour and pop in. (And in case anyone's wondering, they were employing blind shakers üòÇ).

Ôªø

Chapter 1

As the elevator plummeted from the top floor, a violent drop that seemed endless yet painfully brief.

I felt the sharp pain and blood seeping through my clothes. My mind screamed at the horror of it all, because my baby, the tiny life inside me, slipped away.

As soon as the paramedics arrived, they wrapped me in blood-streaked bandages, lifting my broken body onto a stretcher.

There, I saw a glimpse of my boyfriend, Nicholas Richmond, who came back from the meeting with his secretary, Courtney Miller.

His arm protectively curled around Courtney, then he shielded her eyes with a gentle touch, whispering, ‚ÄúDo not look. It is too awful.‚Äù

Without another glance, they stepped through the doors and into the building, leaving me behind.

The realization was like a second fall. It seemed that five years was nothing for him, because I was never that important to Nicholas, while Courtney‚Äôs sweet smile would always occupy his every thought.

That time, I made a decision I had hesitated before, a job offer from a rival company that had been on the table for weeks.

I called them. ‚ÄúI am ready to accept your offe!‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî

After two long days in the hospital, I was finally discharged.

Yet, despite my release, there was no relief. The ache in my heart was far deeper than the physical wounds.

I was leaving the hospital alone, no longer carrying the life I had just discovered was growing inside me.

The morning of the accident had been surreal. A positive test, a flutter of hope, then a nightmare unfolding before I had even grasped the reality.

While packing my few belongings, I whispered to myself, ‚ÄúI do not even know how far along I was.‚Äù

The thought cut through me like a knife. The baby in my belly had been too small and too fragile after all.

Suddenly, the door to my room creaked open, pulling me from my thoughts.

For a brief, foolish moment, I hoped it was Nicholas. But it was not. A driver stood there instead.

‚ÄúMiss McLain, Mr. Richmond had a sudden meeting. He sent me to pick you up,‚Äù the driver explained, his voice polite and detached. ‚ÄúLet me carry your things.‚Äù

I exhaled slowly, feeling the familiar sting of disappointment.

Nicholas always had an excuse, something pressing, something more important. But when Courtney needed anything, he was never too busy.

Two days in the hospital, and not once did he show his face. He had not called, had not come. Nothing.

‚ÄúNo need. I have got it,‚Äù I replied, forcing a smile as I slung my bag over my shoulder and walked out.

The ride home was quiet. The city lights flickered past in a blur, but I could not focus on anything outside the window.

Inside, it felt darker than the night itself. By the time we pulled up to the house, I was numb.

‚ÄúWe are here, Miss,‚Äù the driver said, gently bringing me back to the present.

I reached for my handbag, preparing to step out when something caught my eye. Tucked between the seat cushions was a delicate piece of blue dress, which was not mine.

My stomach twisted. I discreetly grabbed it, slipping it into my bag before the driver opened my door.

Once in my room, I tossed the blue dress onto my dresser, trying to ignore the painful questions racing through my mind. Who did it belong to? And why was it there?

The shower indeed washed away the grime of the hospital, but it did nothing to cleanse the doubt that simmered within me.

However, I brushed it off and climbed into bed, hoping for sleep.

When morning came, I woke to the familiar yet unsettling sight of Nicholas lying beside me.

It had become a routine: him slipping into bed unnoticed after I had already fallen asleep, as if our lives had become nothing more than parallel lines.

We were close, but never touching anymore.

His eyes fluttered open under my gaze. ‚ÄúYou are awake?‚Äù he asked, his voice groggy with sleep.

I did not respond. Instead, I swung my legs over the side of the bed and sat in silence.

‚ÄúIf you are still feeling unwell, you do not need to go into work,‚Äù he added, sitting up.

‚ÄúThere is too much piling up. I cannot afford to take more time off,‚Äù I replied.

My words were flat, emotionless, but inside, a plan was taking shape. I needed to finish what was left at the office, so I could hand in my resignation and leave that life behind.

Nicholas nodded, oblivious to the distance between us. ‚ÄúWell, after all your injuries are just superficial. You will heal quickly,‚Äù he said, slipping into the bathroom, phone in hand, as was his routine.

I watched the door close behind him in disappointment.

He used to take showers fast, but it changed lately. With his phone always in tow, the duration stretched.

However, I could not bring myself to care anymore. I made my way to a different bathroom, determined to avoid him for as long as possible.

When I finished dressing, Nicholas was already sitting on the sofa, a newspaper in hand. He glanced up at me, sarcasm lacing his words. ‚ÄúSkipping our morning coffee ritual? You must be in quite the rush.‚Äù

I ignored his attempt at humor, my voice devoid of any warmth. ‚ÄúIt slipped my mind.‚Äù

A sigh escaped him as he set the paper down. ‚ÄúFine. Let‚Äôs get to the office early then.‚Äù

We had always gone to the office together, ever since deciding to move in three years ago.

Back then, everything felt aligned. We had the same goals, the same routines. But lately, I had begun to feel a shift, a subtle but unmistakable discomfort creeping in.

Nicholas seemed more attached to his phone than to me. Even when I grew distant, hoping he would notice, he carried on as though nothing had changed, like my silence meant nothing.

That morning, I sat quietly in the car as Nicholas, focused on his phone, suddenly spoke up. ""I need coffee. Let‚Äôs stop by the takeaway to get breakfast,"" he said to the driver, not sparing me a glance.

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù the driver replied, the words punctuated by the quiet tap of Nicholas's fingers on his screen.

From the corner of my eye, I could see him chatting with Courtney, his secretary.

\[Nicholas: I left early because Frey had a lot to catch up on after taking yesterday off. Do not rush though, take your time this morning.\]

\[Courtney: I understand, her team has been busy lately, so she must feel guilty about it. You also should take it easy, Nick. Your schedule is light today, just some proposals to review and a meeting later.\]

\[Nicholas: Good. Can you also make a reservation at the usual place for lunch?\]

\[Courtney: Of course! Any preference on what to try today?\]

I stopped reading after that, feeling the sting of their easy camaraderie.

Plans, always plans, but never with me. I was not part of the lunches or the lighthearted conversations. It was as if they were the ones in a relationship, not Nicholas and I.

So, what was I to him, really?

Soon, we arrived at the takeaway. Nicholas rolled down the window, casually giving his order.

‚ÄúI want a hot Americano and an iced Americano. Oh, and a caramel Frappe too. Plus, one chocolate croissant and two peanut butter croissants. That will be all.‚Äù

I did not think much of it at first, assuming he ordered more for the driver. But after collecting the food, he handed me the iced Americano and peanut butter croissant.

I stared at the croissant, stunned.

‚ÄòAfter five years, did he still not remember that I am allergic to peanuts?‚Äô I wondered.

The trunk is wide enough that four men could reach around it with their arms stretched out, but it is not that tall. It is bent and crooked. The trunk is blackened, as if the tree had burned. But it is not dead, it is only sleeping, they say those who are asked. Let's hope it won't wake up, they finish.

It stands alone in a clearing, as if no other trees or plants dare to grow near it. The ground is dry and lifeless. The roots curl across the cracked ground like the tentacles of some deep-sea creature, the bare branches reach skyward like fingers desperately scrabbling for something to grab hold to. No birds build their nest in the tree, no squirrels, not even insects seem to want to come near it.

There is a small sign next to the tree that tells us that it is an old ""magic tree"" where people are said to have stuck nails, among other things, to cure diseases and the like. According to the sign, it's called the Father's Tree, but by the natives it's called the Fear‚Äôs Tree.

Every now and then the tree bears leaves, these are red as fresh blood. There is no rhyme or reason to when the tree bears it‚Äôs red leaves, it can happen at any time of the year. With no clear cycle for when and how far between. Sometimes two years in a row, sometimes more rarely, sometimes after ten. They just come. Then the old men and women who sit in the cafes drinking their coffee or who sit and stare blankly in front of them at the retirement home begin to whisper to each other: ""It's hungry"", they say, ""Now it's going to eat soon"".

The toddlers on the preschool playground run around and shout at each other: ""Be careful or the tree will catch you!"" Those who are closest to life's extremes feel it, they know what awaits.

And every time this happens someone disappears, also this completely incomprehensible and without reason, incoherently. Sometimes an animal, tame or wild, sometimes a human, old or young. It doesn't seem to matter.

As often they are found by the roots of the tree. Cold, dead and covered by the tree's red leaves.

Then the old people stop whispering and the children stops playing ‚Äòthe tree takes you‚Äô and everything returns to normal, and the tree goes back to slumber. How long until next time?

No other change and walking more steps a day on average. Since cutting out the milk I‚Äôve GAINED weight. I‚Äôm up 5 lbs with no end in sight as the scale inches up. 

I put milk back in my coffee yesterday had a great day.  I was thinking maybe the lack of that boosted my cortisol? Thoughts?

1g9g6yu,https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/1g9g6yu/post_poem_discomfort_questions/,Post POEM discomfort questions.,"Hello all,

Was diagnosed with achalasia last year around September after struggling  since May with constant coughing during the night and a bit of regurgitation when attempting to sleep ..which got progressively worse.  
I had 5 pneumatic dilatations done which only aided for a short while.  
Due to the rarity of the disorder and lack of general knowledge about it in eastern Europe... it took ages to find a doctor able which was able to perform the surgery.  
Luckily , despite the huge cost, managed to find a doctor which performed the surgery.  
Unfortunately, during the initial screening, it was discovered that the side of the esophagus was very big (dilation of 7-8 cm vs the normal size of 1-2 cm).This was considered a complication , however , the surgery was a success.  
Post op barium swallow showed perfect passing of the liquid.

Currently 6 days post surgery.  
Initially, I had sharp pain when swallowing and felt the clips when moving around (1st two days).  
Was told to follow a liquid only diet for 2 days (48 hrs) then try to introduce pasted soups / thin purees.  
On the liquid diet, only had the sharp spikes in pain when drinking ...no clumping or anything/pressure.

After the 48hs of liquids only, I tried a very thin soup and noticed that slight pressure was happening  
Discussed with the gastroenterologist which monitors my condition and he suggested I try to add some water.

I did that, however, it increased the pressure too much and I vomited.  
After that, pressure disappeared and I felt like a huge weight was lifted.  
I skipped eating and only drank liquid's for the day as recommended by the gastro doc.  
Next day, I kept it mostly liquids again.  
Did a barium swallow and it seems that ... liquid is piling up again in a slight bent/ pouch formed where the surgery happened. Was told that we should monitor until Friday when we'll do another barium swallow.  
The doctor suggests that the issue is most likely due to the inflammation still being present post op .  
He then explained that my case was going towards terminal achalasia and that the surgery was like a last attempt on fixing this.  
Mentioned that generally cases up from 7-8 cm + sized dilation could generally involve **Esophagectomy**¬† but he wants to 100% avoid even suggesting this.

The main symptom causing me issues which lead to the investigation which landed me this diagnostic, was constant regurgitation/chocking/vomiting during the night which lead to a shitty overall quality of life.  
After the surgery took place, this is 100%  gone.  
So something good did happen.

From my tests:

* Liquid past 300ml swallowed in small sips causes pressures
* Soups / puree soups past almost the same ml =>causes pressures.
* Purees which a thicker consistency - past 100 gr => causes pressures. If I try to water them down, It increases the pressure and causes vomiting.

I am 100% concerned about this , it went from perfect passing to a small bent piling stuff up...makes little sense to me.

1)Could the inflation be causing issues?  
2)I read that usually after a week the pain should subside and that inflation should as well? Am I too soon to assume that I should also fall into this time frame but it would differ from person to person?  
Indeed the pain has reduced from day to day, a bit (when swallowing) and so has the sharp sensation when I breathe in (from small breaths hurting to medium breaths hurting and so on).  
3)Should I stick to a more watered down soup / more liquid soup for a while due to the complication etc?  
4)Should I panic?

A timeline would be:

Surgery day:16 OCT=> 1st 24hrs 17 OCT =>2nd 24hrs 18 OCT  
17 OCT+18 OCT  = 1st 24hrs = Liquids  
19 OCT => First attempt at soup => First 200ml went well then piled.  
Later in the day , I tried to finish the last 300ml of soup and then that's when the pressure/discomfort started.  
20 OCT => Kept to liquids  
21 OCT =>After discussing with the gastro doc , did a barium swallow which showed pile up which dispersed after approx. 30 mins.  
22 OCT => Drank some coffee with milk => went down no problem.  
Decided to have a first meal with some potato puree (slightly thinned down with some milk ) => caused pressure.  
When I tried to add some water => Caused vomit + even some food from last night was expulsed.

Any opinions would be greatly appreciated.

Hello my friends,

First of all, Forza Ferrari!

I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1g51r4y/onebag_for_the_f1_race_at_cota_in_my_20l/) bag layout about a week ago for my long weekend in Austin for the F1 race, and a few folks requested I post a trip report. So here it is!

*Full disclosure that I‚Äôve never written a trip report before, so I‚Äôm so open to feedback. Hopefully the mix here of the trip & how the OneBag turned out is ok!*

**Day 1 (departure, sprint, & quali)-**

I was originally going to bike to DCA then have a layover in Dallas before getting to Austin, and was pretty psyched for the great airport biking experiment. Unfortunately for the biking experiment (but hypothetically better for everything else) I ended up flying direct from BWI to try to make it to the Sprint race.

I did still use a CaBi to Union Station at 5:50, and it was COLD. I wasn‚Äôt expecting this at all when I packed, so my outfit was the first audible I had to call. This is what I wore:

* Yoga pants. I would have worn fleece lined given the weather if I wasn‚Äôt Onebagging to sunny, gorgeous Austin.
* Tank top, light long sleeve sweater & sweatshirt. This sweatshirt was originally packed in my bag, but I knew I would be chilly and I really did not want to bring a coat.
* Thick socks & Reeboks
* Gloves. Mine are so small, so was very easy to just throw in my bag, especially because my 20L was not stuffed to the brim to start with.

While I was cold and sleepy, a good bike ride is always the best way to start my day.

When I got to the airport, I threw my sweatshirt & gloves in my bag and was quite comfortable. Plus, with the early adventure and light exercise, I fell asleep in my middle seat like 5 mins after takeoff. New record for me!

My plane was delayed, so I didn‚Äôt end up making it to the Sprint ): My friends had fun there though, and I got tacos and a margarita at El Arroyo (great recommendation from u/Substantial_Heron_98), before dropping my stuff at the Airbnb and heading to the track for quali.

Also, this probably isn‚Äôt necessary info, but the cast of this trip were a few old friends and my dad. We all got into F1 back in high school, which was weird for a group of 15 year old Americans at that time, and it sorta turned into tradition as we got older to go on the friends trip (chaperoned by my father) to an F1 race. Now that we are certified adults with lives spread out across the states, we don‚Äôt really keep in touch except for this trip.

Here‚Äôs what I wore to the track on day 1:

* Travel tank top & linen long sleeve on top
* Tennis skirt
* Hat! (a later edition to my packing list that I‚Äôm SO glad I brought, thanks to a reminder from u/gullibleguppypuppy)

Here‚Äôs a pic. 

[Don‚Äôt mind the lighting on these, they were taken in the Airbnb.](https://preview.redd.it/wbhks5ktmawd1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d42631b47187c5e15163490bfbe83b5ca70d9837)

Here‚Äôs what I put in my clear stadium bag:

* Portable charger
* Airpods
* Glossier balm dot com
* Zofran
* Wallet
* Kindle
* Protein bar
* Earplugs

Quail went as well as I could ask for (I'm anti-Merc and I'm so sorry for that). Plus, it was a gorgeous sunset. I forgot that the southwest was like that.

https://preview.redd.it/qdj4aebinawd1.jpg?width=3213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0630d63147f81e0e5de39410c8123e5b62bd7980

After quali, we ubered to our 9pm resy at Barley Swine. We didn‚Äôt have time to go back to the Airbnb, which is why I wore what I wore to quali. It was SO good and really fun. The wine pairing was excellent as well.

Then we (me and my friends, not my dear father) went to Barbarella to dance, because Saturday night only happens once a week! I‚Äôd never gone out like that with this group, so I‚Äôm glad we had such a good time. I also wore my dinner/quali outfit to this, which I can‚Äôt say was the correct choice, but they let me in so it couldn‚Äôt have been that bad.

**Day 2 - Race day**

We had gotten home at like 2am, so I needed to catch up on sleep more than I needed breakfast. At 10am we headed to the track. I got lunch at Four Brothers which was excellent. My friends got BBQ.

This is what I wore to the race:

* Ferrari jersey
* Black tennis skirt
* Reeboks and hat

My stadium bag had all the same stuff as the day before, plus some of the boy‚Äôs stuff. I had recharged my power bank overnight, so ready to rock!

And talk about a great day to be a Ferrari fan! 1-2 in case you missed it. The crowd was great too. The people there were clearly into good racing, so the Norris/Verstappen battle was thrilling for everyone, no matter whose shirt they were wearing. Justice for Norris but I digress.

Not every race I‚Äôve been to has had that energy.

I did get to write a letter to Danny Ric too, thank goodness!

https://preview.redd.it/u9h87jc6nawd1.jpg?width=1209&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09d1bd20e0426f9a6b350cb6ddc1d1fdab56ef14

We didn‚Äôt stick around for the post-race festivities. We tried to get out of there quickly, since we wanted to clean up before dinner. And we were tiredddd after the heat, crowds, and day drinking. I think we‚Äôve been to enough races to expect traffic to be bad, but still, yikes.

Dinner was at Este, to which I wore:

* Black t-shirt under a dress
* I tried to clean off my Reebok‚Äôs, but they were still gross.

Here‚Äôs a pic

https://preview.redd.it/1rbnu2oxmawd1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1ce4a077a8a5901230797e9f4c62d524c2edebd

Este was also great! In no way beat Barley Swine, but we sat outside and the company (and wine) was so fantastic that we hung out for like 2.5 hours.

**Day 3 - a day in Austin:**

So some of my friends took a late flight home Sunday, and the rest got a really early start Monday. My flight wasn‚Äôt until 8pm though (I think just because I couldn‚Äôt afford an earlier one haha), so I got a slow start, cleaned up the Airbnb, and was the last one out of the place.

Usually I‚Äôm a go go go on vaycay type of person, but I needed a day to take it slower. After grabbing coffee and shipping some forgotten items to my dad, I visited the Zilker Botanical garden, then biked to Franklin‚Äôs for BBQ (another rec from our fav u/Substantial_Heron_98).

Next, I walked to BookPeople as it consistently makes the list of best bookstores in TX and needed more coffee, then just hung out on the rooftop of Austin Central Library to enjoy the sun.

https://preview.redd.it/ljjl8l51nawd1.jpg?width=2358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aab4f299540ca2fcb861d3dbfecd853b06ce89f6

By the way, BookPeople was awesome. They are big on face-out books which I love for them, and the abundance of those staff pick cards was so much fun to read. If you like bookstores and are in Austin, you should go.

I was gonna hit up Odd Duck for dinner but turns out I didn‚Äôt have enough time before my flight (oops), and I had leftover BBQ I‚Äôd been carrying around all day anyways that would be a good din din anyways.

Here‚Äôs what I wore during the day:

* Black tank top and linen shirt
* Denim shorts
* Fully packed backpack, which I carried around all day. It‚Äôs why we do it haha.

Here‚Äôs a pic

At the airport, I kept the tank top but changed into:

* Light sweater & yoga pants
* cozy socks

I got into BWI after midnight, and since I had to work in the morning just took a Lyft back home to DC.

**Trip reflections:**

* We did not miss on food. Again, shoutout to you all for the assist on the lunches.
* If I had more energy or didn‚Äôt have to work on Tuesday, there‚Äôs a few more things I would have liked to do in Austin. However, reading my book in the sun was pretty perfect.
* The race was one of my favs I‚Äôve been to. Between the good crowd, better food than I‚Äôm used to at the track, easy to see leaderboard (not sure if that‚Äôs the right word, but at other races it‚Äôs not been so clear as to the order & intervals of the drivers) and good battles, I really had a great time.
* Best trip of the year so far!

**Packing reflections:**

* First of all, my bag was as empty as it gets for long weekends. I don‚Äôt know if I packed less than normal or what, but carrying it around that last day really didn‚Äôt suck. Love it when I pack corrrectly!
* If I knew I was going out out, I would have thrown a dress for the club in my bag and maybe some mascara, but that is what it is. We had a crazy fun time anyways.
* I‚Äôve got my toiletries so dialed in at this point, so I used all of them and wasn‚Äôt missing anything. I know that I¬†*could*¬†probably cut down on skincare or makeup, but I‚Äôd rather cut down on every other category out there. 
* One pair of sneakers (that I wear on the plane) always works well for me. Sometimes I‚Äôll throw a pair of flip flops in my bag, but totally didn‚Äôt need it this time and glad I didn‚Äôt.
* Is it time to stop bringing wired earbuds and a pen ‚Äújust in case‚Äù? Sound off below

So that‚Äôs my trip report! Hopefully it was ok that it was a mix of the travel & the OneBag related stuff. My next trip coming up is a Halloweekend trip to Edinburgh, and that is going to be one of the most unorthodox OneBag packing lists of all time, so stay tuned!",6,1729597209.0,onebag,1,0.88,False

When it does, it sucks, but I'm getting better at hitting my daily goals while also using reddit. Maybe some day I will perfect productivity, but at the moment I'm at the good enough stage. I go to the gym most days, I get my cardio in too, I sit at the park for a while and occasionally visit coffee shops or the mall or something, and I keep up with chores. One other thing I want to do is write a book, which I could spend more time doing, and occasionally do. So I got myself together, I don't let it control me.

But if for the entire rest of the time is spent on Reddit? Why not?

The only thing I'd sacrifice it for is a better social life, and a relationship. But quitting reddit isn't going to magically bring that to life. I do go out, maybe not as often as I would if I cut reddit and bored myself enough to force myself into more situations, but I go out a decent amount. I'm kinda hoping the mild amount I do go out will eventually amount to something, but until then I'm not going to force myself off reddit.

Some of my happiest memories have been on reddit. Joking around on  r/okbuddychicanery when Better Call Saul was airing, discussing and memeing politics this 2024 election, discussing on fandom boards, or just all around interesting topics. Learning different things, some of which will have impact on my life (health stuff, workout routines, skincare, how to look more attractive, mental health stuff, self development stuff, religion and spirituality, a little bit of philosophy) and some that won't but is interesting nonetheless (True crime stories, stuff about music i like/shows and movies i watch, The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet, North Sentinel Island, just a lot of random stuff), some that'll stick some that I'll forget about.

I like it here. There's a discussion board for any interesting topic, and with the help of google and threads spanning from over the years I can learn a lot about a topic. And thanks to active users, I can ask questions that I can't find answers for. About nearly anything! And have an in depth discussion about it!

Is it good or bad? I don't know yet. Maybe I'm wasting my life, maybe I'm not. I'm hopeful other aspects of my life pay off, but I'm happy to have Reddit as a part of my life.",2,1729596644.0,nosurf,2,1.0,False

Sometimes I think about moving to Australia but there's a lot of things I don't know yet. 

How's the economy there?  What's the living cost of having a small apartment around 500 square feet?

I work as a Software Engineer, I have a university degree and a master's. Can I get a good income in Australia and afford living and raise a family?

What sort of activities do you do in Australia?

Apart from the usual, such as exercising, going to the gym, cinema, etc. Do you have tourist attractions? Sightseeing? How do you spend your Sunday or day off? Do you pet Kangaroos?

Do you have cafeterias?

I mostly work from home, there are times where I just take my laptop and work from a cafeteria and I socialize a bit. Also the price for coffee here is around 4‚Ç¨ and the brunch costs around 8‚Ç¨, I spend around 12‚Ç¨ in total. Is the coffee pricy or is adjusted to the basic monthly income?

What's the weather like?

What's the coldest and hottest temepratures?

Which cities are calm, good for a daily and quiet life?

What about the people? Is it easy to create new friendships? Do you socialize with strangers? Do you have meetup, Facebook groups where you can do activities and meet new people?

What other languages do you speak? If I live in Australia do I need to learn another language 

Do you have Greeks and Greek Communities?


I know these are many questions and of course some questions have answers that are self explanatory or the answer is simply ""of course"" like ""of course we have cafeterias"". But every culture is different.

1. Eat Protein or Fat Before Carbs

	‚Ä¢	How it works: Consuming protein or healthy fats before carbohydrates helps slow down the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream. This can prevent a rapid spike in blood sugar.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Eat a handful of nuts, avocado, or a piece of cheese before consuming high-carb foods like bread or pasta.

2. Choose Fiber-Rich Foods

	‚Ä¢	How it works: Foods high in fiber slow down digestion and the release of glucose into the blood. Soluble fiber, in particular, helps control blood sugar levels.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Opt for vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and fruits like berries or apples with the peel on.

3. Walk After Meals

	‚Ä¢	How it works: Light physical activity, like walking for 10-15 minutes after a meal, helps muscles use up glucose from the bloodstream, reducing blood sugar levels.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Take a brisk walk or do some light household chores after eating.

4. Stay Hydrated

	‚Ä¢	How it works: Dehydration can lead to higher blood sugar levels. Drinking plenty of water helps the kidneys flush out excess glucose through urine.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Drink water consistently throughout the day, especially before and after meals.

5. Add Vinegar Before Meals

	‚Ä¢	How it works: Vinegar, particularly apple cider vinegar, has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and slow the rate at which carbohydrates are converted into glucose.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Add 1-2 tablespoons of vinegar to a glass of water and drink it before a carb-heavy meal.

6. Eat Smaller, Frequent Meals

	‚Ä¢	How it works: Large meals can overwhelm the body with glucose, causing spikes. Eating smaller, more frequent meals helps maintain steady blood sugar levels.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Divide your daily food intake into 4-6 smaller meals, focusing on balanced macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbs).

7. Prioritize Whole Foods Over Processed Foods

	‚Ä¢	How it works: Processed foods, especially those high in refined sugars and flours, cause rapid glucose spikes. Whole foods like vegetables, fruits, lean proteins, and whole grains break down more slowly, preventing blood sugar surges.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Swap white bread, pastries, or sugary snacks for whole grain alternatives, fresh fruit, and vegetables.

8. Incorporate Resistant Starch

	‚Ä¢	How it works: Resistant starch resists digestion in the small intestine, leading to a slower release of glucose. It also improves insulin sensitivity.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Cook and cool foods like rice, potatoes, and pasta (e.g., in salads). Cooling these starchy foods increases their resistant starch content.

9. Pair Carbs with Protein and Fat

	‚Ä¢	How it works: Combining carbohydrates with protein and fat helps slow down digestion, leading to a slower rise in blood sugar levels.
	‚Ä¢	Example: If eating a piece of fruit, pair it with nuts, seeds, or yogurt. With pasta, add chicken, olive oil, or avocado.

10. Get Enough Sleep and Manage Stress

	‚Ä¢	How it works: Lack of sleep and chronic stress can negatively affect insulin sensitivity and increase blood sugar levels. Cortisol, the stress hormone, can lead to glucose spikes.
	‚Ä¢	Example: Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night and practice stress management techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga.

Bonus Tips:

	‚Ä¢	Limit Sugary Beverages: Sugary drinks like soda and fruit juice can cause rapid blood sugar spikes. Opt for water, tea, or coffee without added sugar.
	‚Ä¢	Eat Vegetables First: Eating non-starchy vegetables before starchy or sugary foods can reduce the impact of glucose on your blood sugar levels.

Incorporating these simple strategies can have a significant impact on managing glucose spikes, especially for individuals looking to maintain better blood sugar control or improve metabolic health.",1,1729595994.0,OnjaLife,0,1.0,False

Thought I'd share my experience with three different options I've used over the past few months.

Tried out the **Waterdrop X16**, **Waterdrop WD-A1**, and **Melissani M1**. Here's what I found:

**Waterdrop X16** This thing is seriously impressive. The sleek design fits perfectly under my sink, and the smart faucet is an absolute game changer!! my partner actually commented that he thinks it looks better than our original faucet. Water comes out incredibly fast (fills my 20oz water bottle in seconds), and the taste is noticeably clean but not stripped of minerals.

[What it looks like :\)](https://preview.redd.it/q00wn5pakawd1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4910cb73f262ae8654e9b5d6a65b61192cbc5bb)

Pros:

* Lightning-fast water flow
* Space-saving tankless design
* Real-time water quality monitoring
* Really efficient with water usage (3:1 ratio)

Cons:

* Definetaly more pricey but for what you get its a steal
* Requires initial setup under sink but can be dont super quick and easy

**Waterdrop WD-A1** Decent countertop option if you want both hot and cold water. The temperature options are nice for tea and coffee.

Pros:

* Multiple temperature settings
* No installation needed
* Good for offices or rentals

Cons:

* Takes up counter space
* Slower filtration than the X16
* Need to refill manually

**Melissani M1** Basic portable option. Works okay but feels less refined than the Waterdrop models.

Pros:

* Truly portable
* Simple to use
* Decent filtration

Cons:

* Smaller capacity
* Build quality feels less premium
* Slower filtration speed

Bottom line: If you can swing it, the **Waterdrop X16** is worth the investment it's what I ended up keeping and is by far the best countertop reverse osmosis system on the market. The **WD-A1** is good if you want a no installation option with temperature control. The **Melissani** works if you have a stricter budget but wouldn't be my first choice.

yesterday i went to the lake. its usually the closest thing i have to a ""safe place"", but i had been avoiding it to not remember things. i sat there for 2 hours, letting myself feel cold, closed my eyes and breathed in the fresh air and read quite a bit. i texted back my friend instead of ignoring her, we chatted quite a bit. she told me she didnt understand how i never cried at anything or expresed any negative emotion. it made me question myself which lead to yesterday night where i stayed up until 4 am with good music in my headphones and stared at my ceiling, i tried to decypher my thoughts and figure out why feeling things again scared me so much. i cried for the first time in 5 months last night, it was only a tear or two but it felt really good to feel something besides numbness again. it felt relieving. 

i crave alcohol everyday obviously. i arrived earlier than expected to my academy and there are a lot of places that sell alcoholic beverages. i briefly considered it as i always do, but instead i sat down at a regular cafe and got a coffee and pulled out a good book instead. 

there is a little tradition my ex roommate introduced me to where everytime i buy a new pack of cigarettes i pull one out and make a wish before placing it back backwards near the rest and smoke that one last. i know it sounds weird but i had stopped doing that too since i didnt want to make wishes and make myself vulnerable.  i did it again today and wished to create better art, finish my book and feel more this week. i also listened to music from my childhood. small and insignificant seeming progress is still progress isnt it?

It was uneventful except for a missed 18 miler due to a sprained ankle, a *lot* of uncertainty over said ankle for about four weeks, and a race weekend with zero rest‚ÄîI attended a Harris rally Friday and was on my feet for six hours, and I worked 7-8 hours on Saturday, also on my feet‚Äîboth days I didn‚Äôt carb load or hydrate like I wanted to. Not my best or brightest move, but‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs life! I tapered a bit extra to compensate so I only ran twice leading up to race day, a 7.5 mile workout Sunday and 3 miles Wednesday. 

I live 35 minutes, tops, from the starting line. This was a bonus‚Äîmy first race choice was Detroit and I was disappointed to not get in, but the silver lining was less travel. I‚Äôve driven to GR for countless races, and I got it on LOCK. 

Or so I thought. lol 

The starting line for this race is right near the parking lots I tend to use, which were also the lots the race crew recommended. I was running behind (stopped for a banana and a Mt. Dew, okay, it was important) but not super behind; GPS had me arriving before 7:30. Plenty of time, it was still cold and dark so I didn‚Äôt want tons of ‚Äústand around and wait‚Äù time anyway. 

But then I got stuck in traffic. I sat, for 15-20 minutes, in the road next to the lot I wanted to park in, the one that was already full. I could see the bathrooms I desperately needed to be in, and the starting line. It was torture. lol I needed to turn right at a light up ahead to get to the other side of the lot, or the other lot. Easy peasy right? No. No it was not. I ended up switching lanes and going up an exit on the highway hoping to turn back‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt do something right, or GPS corrected me according to closed roads, something, and I wound up SIX MILES from the start. At one point I was slamming on my brakes at a one way ‚Äústreet‚Äù (perhaps a trail tbh) into the woods and doing a u-turn to get pointed the right direction. At another point (or five) I was going 97 down the highway, crying, trying to get to the exit I hoped would work. I was almost home free, last turn‚Ä¶ and the road was already blocked. So I whipped around, parked at a questionable looking bar, and literally *ran* the half mile to the start while pinning my bib on my shirt. 

When I found the start they were announcing staging for the 10K. I looked at the guy with the microphone and pointed to my bib, half laughing, half crying. He goes ‚ÄúMarathon? That way! Like six minutes ago!‚Äù He ran the last 100 yards with me to the start which was cute but also embarrassing because hello, he is speaking to me, but into the microphone?! ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Whatever I‚Äôm fine. I didn‚Äôt eat my last snack but it‚Äôs gonna be fiiiine. I almost forgot to start my watch, but was close enough. 

I start running. I‚Äôm dodging people left and right because I am not fast, but I‚Äôm faster than this particular group of humans. I realize fairly quickly that while I do feel great, I‚Äôm going WAY too fast. My plan was 11:00 miles for 16 miles, and my first mile was uhhhhh 9:32. Whoops! I tried to slow down, but 10:15 was the best I could do. I was running pretty consistently and comfortably so I decided to hold onto 10-10:30 as long as I could. Not a great strategy, but my legs were ready to go, the taper did its job‚Ä¶ why not? 

But, the real problem with the beginning was‚Ä¶ I had to find a bathroom. By the first aid station at mile 2, it had been like, 2 hours, 32oz of water, and 16oz coffee since I left the house. But‚Ä¶ there was a line. So I said F it, next aid station it is. I did this for an hour and 45 minutes, and found a line-free bathroom at mile 10. I tried then to rearrange my hydration pack, put on the headband I didn‚Äôt have time for, grab the AirPods I didn‚Äôt have time for‚Ä¶ it was a mess, I dropped a lot of stuff, and it took way too long! (My mom noticed a 16:00 mile around this time and started to panic lol) But I got going, just in time to find the pace group I meant to start with. Hooray! 

I followed the Al Gore pacers for about four miles. They were VERY cute, one was a doctor, one was probably 70 years old, and the third was singing every song and shouting ‚ÄúPEANUT BUTTER‚Äù when we got going too fast. lol it was slower, comfortably at first but eventually uncomfortably‚Ä¶ my form isn‚Äôt great under 11:00 so things were more painful than they needed to be. So, I took a walk break, and knew right away it was going to be run-walk the rest of the way in. 

Several miles in here were an out and back, so there were faster people coming at me, which was fun because some of them were fellow run clubbers, and a former lieutenant governor I resisted the urge to yell at. The mile markers on that side were a mental game‚Äîseeing 20 when you know you‚Äôre not at 20 is harder than running 20, I think. lol I couldn‚Äôt comprehend where the turnaround was, and I wasted too much mental energy trying to do the math. I was running .25-.40 mile intervals and .10 walks, which was working okay, but‚Ä¶ the bumpy trail was destroying my feet and my already-sore ankles. 

I switched to 3 minutes on, 1 minute off, and started grabbing Gatorade from aid stations. I had Liquid IV with me like always, but was way thirstier than usual and it was running low. Knowing I was toward the back of the pack I chose to take electrolytes and save mine for the end if I needed them. It was a decent idea, but the Gatorade mix was horrendous. lol 

I eventually went to 2 on, 2 off. The last 4-5 miles were *windy* and that is never my strong suit‚ÄîI‚Äôd rather charge a hill than run into the wind. I traded walk breaks with a few of the same people for miles, which is always fun. One group of dudes I‚Äôd been near for an hour gave me a fist bump at a particularly horrible stretch of windy trail, and it kept me going. 

Getting back into the city, there‚Äôs about a mile to go but you can‚Äôt see a dang thing, and there‚Äôs not much crowd. I knew my watch was about a quarter mile ahead so I was trying to avoid looking at the mileage when I looked at the time, but yeah, I failed. lol there was a very cute old man telling everyone how great they were, and how proud they should be for still going when clearly we had all wanted to quit at least once. There was also a couple who was politely encouraging everyone til they saw their friend, and went absolutely bat shit crazy. I considered asking them if they‚Äôd be my friend too. 

For the last mile or so, I traded intervals with a dude who eventually became my best friend and/or angel. He said ‚Äúonce we get to the light we just have to GO FOR IT‚Äù and we fist bumped, but sadly I could not finish in one stretch‚Äîit was longer than it looked. lol still, runners are the best people, because runners don‚Äôt believe in personal space or stranger danger and I love that about us. 

Of course I immediately lost that guy before buying him a beer for his trouble, which makes me wonder if he was even real? I wandered through the chute looking for water and chocolate milk (and other run clubbers to drink with) and took a medal. I didn‚Äôt find any familiar faces, so I stumbled out and started walking, hopefully the right direction, while I got my GPS going to the car. 

Half a mile has never been so long. Every stoplight was a gamble‚Äîwill I be able to keep going after I stop?! lol I made it, but not without being told I ‚Äúlook great‚Äù (read the room, dude) and panicking that I put the wrong place into google maps because it took me back a different way than I came. 

When I got to the car I expected a ticket, but hooray! No ticket. Went to take a medal selfie and realized‚Ä¶ I had the wrong medal. It says ‚Äúmarathon relay.‚Äù I did not do a relay, I did the whole thing. üòÇ So I fired off an email to the race director begging for a trade and headed home. I almost got out of the car and up the stairs in a reasonable amount of time, so, I guess you could call that a win? 

All in all, my friends, this was the most chaotic morning and chaotic race of my entire life. All of the ‚Äúit can only happen to me‚Äù things did, indeed, happen to me‚Äîthe only thing that didn‚Äôt happen was me tripping and falling, which would have truly been the icing on the cake. Yet, it was a really great day! My time was about 15 minutes slower than my A goal , but more or less exactly the B goal. I am pretty thrilled with that, considering the chaos, I think I overcame pretty well. lol (if you are a ‚Äúchip time only‚Äù runner, please do not come at me about how I am counting my watch time as my official time‚ÄîI paused twice, once to pee and once to fix my shoelaces okay?! Leave me alone! lol) 

ONE MILLION THANKS to everyone who supported me, encouraged me, reminded me to eat, fed me, told me to sit down all week (even when I didn‚Äôt listen) shared stories and miles and beers with me during training, and just generally kept me sane and not crying. I have the best friends and family in the world, and it‚Äôs not even close. 

I can‚Äôt decide if I‚Äôll ever do this again, but that‚Äôs a problem for later me! For now, it‚Äôs a week off from running (maybe two!) and a LOT of food and beer. I‚Äôm stuck at home today because I don‚Äôt think my legs will get me up the stairs to my office, and I still have a migraine‚Ä¶ so that‚Äôs fun, but I‚Äôm pretty grateful for the flexibility of my job right now!

*I've been struggling a little to find time to grieve and find a job quick bc of my home situation (at least i think).*

*In my perspective, my fam isn't willing to take responsibility for most of their actions & rely on a good samaritan (or bothered soul; me) to fix it*. *But I also feel like I'm wrong.*

Or at least, it's my opinion only ‚Äî I feel like a victim & are having doubts about my feelings (explained below).

So far, my 'luck' has been bad and I also lost my cat this year, which left me in debt as it needed emergency medical treatment and dried up my savings.

---

# NOTE: LONG POST!! IF YOU LIKE STORIES.

There's much things that's happened bc we're a big family. We're 6 in the fam & live with some of our workers (10?)

---

**ON MY SAVINGS:**  
I only started my first actual job last year but it was bad timing.

I couldn't handle my brain being overwhelmed everyday on the choice of:

* Help care for Dad
* Continue Work
   * a little toxic and time-consuming, but genuinely fulfilling
   * wfh, underpaid, overtime for deadlines, one-man department, startup company

I decided to quit bc work planned more projects for me as protege(?) & my brain can't help frustration of eating convenience store food, 4 hours sleep, & general unawareness of work that project deliverables need at least a month for planning, creating, and executing vs. 1-2 weeks.

---

**HOME SITUATION:**

I took care of my dad as the night-shift caregiver bc I was the only one who's able to handle missing sleep or sleeping less than 6 hours). Also bc I recently quit so not busy.

Now that dad's passed, our semi-public home is home again for our whole family except:

* Eldest sister's (F29) brought her SO + their 6 dogs. We already have many dogs & 2 cats (my youngest sister's, F19).
* Her dogs not properly trained (poo&pee in the house uncleaned) & can't dog(??)
* Have unfixed females that got their heat recently hence my lack of sleep since 6 weeks ago (aside from sleep debt from caregiving)

I already warned them (failed) 3 days before this bc the dogs were getting restless.

The 6 weeks consecutive was just filled with dog fights inside the house at random times.

I'm one of 2 people who successfully grabs the big dogs while they're mauling each other without visibly panicking.

Walls are thin so even if my room was corner side, you can hear any scream or general laughter clearly.

The couple (sis+SO) go overseas for work a lot (events) so that too, default left to people in the house to help if dogs fought.

---

**ME SITUATION:**

I'm a psych grad, so I prioritize mental wellbeing & non-chaos as much as possible.

I have pending dx of ASD or maybe cPTSD wc needs a therapist once I get a job. But I think I'm a little well-adjusted / well-socialized enough to not need diagnoses anyway.

I am the lightest-sleeper (can't sleep once woken after 1-2 hrs.)

I'm a little predictable.

* I'm the only one in our house to wear Plain White shirts and Nike Shorts in different colors everyday.
* I use one slipper/shoes (the only white crocs in the house too) to go out.
* I have 3 uniquely shaped mugs/tumblers that I personally wash & keep in a high cabinet that are distinctly unique from our uniform mugs (tons, bc mom collects).

---

**FOR MOM**

These last 6 weeks felt like my body was couldn't keep burning more oil anymore.

* Mom requested I undergo a hormone therapy for my amenorrhea this month for her sanity & I accept bc I understand this as her grieving.
* I try to understand my siblings' jittery attitudes bc I also give myself space to grieve for a year, so it's just fair to them.

I'm trying my best to adjust to a new lifestyle governed by symptoms from hormone fluctuations & monthly bleeding, **it's very new and a first to me**.

My body aches, my brain is overwhelmed (i think) from grieving, finding a job, bleeding, and trying to make sense why time seemed to pass by too quickly & I can't remember much anymore which worries me + adds to problems.

---

**ON ELDEST SISTER:**

Within those 6 weeks, aside from dogfights, my eldest sister hosted 2 visitors. She used my mug collection twice, to serve coffee.

I asked her if she used it in a flat tone (to not trigger)

(1st time) she said nobody answered when she asked \[i just woke up to also make my cup\]

(2nd) she claimed it was her new tumbler's straw (even when it was yellowing)

I laid out evidence, yellowing clear straw with abrasion marks & my cup was the only clear SB tumbler, she stayed quiet & started a topic with guest & SO.

Ignoring? So, I told her not to do so next time, & told her I'll understand *this time* specially since these take quite the effort to actually get (i place them in the highest cupboard away from the eyes) ‚Äî

She just raised her tone a little and told me to just stop repeating bc ""I didn't know okay, geez. (You) keep creating problems being cranky in the morning.""

---

**ON YOUNGEST:**

My only slipper also went missing for more than a week only to find my youngest s. had been using it.

I had to (beg) ask my mom for her spare slipper bc our compound is literally an outdoors area. Need to walk to get to buildings.

When asked flatly, she just told me ""I thought it was ....'s"" <- mumbled,

Me: ""Whose?"",

Her: \*mumbles before running away to buy her chickens' food.\*

I asked my mom to help me tell her that I was upset from the lack of acknowledgement of her mistake.

I used to have anger issues or bad mouth / mean words as a child. Probable ASD symptom.

I didn't expect sorry's I only wanted her to admit she made a mistake as proof that she's now aware I was upset. Today she's completely ignoring me.

So I just told her concisely *early in the morning* that

* I just fed her cats their last bowl of food
* Cats no food for dinner if not bought today
* She should be the one to ask mom for money this time
* She should buy it this time because I always do it (due to her having school, but she didn't have classes today)

Answer is silence. I just took it as a yes & respected her boundaries.

I reminded her in our group chat bc i saw her talking about buying dog food for my sister's dog after lunch.

Our driver only works until 5pm, and 4pm she still hasn't moved an inch from her room. It takes 30 minutes to buy cat food.

---

**WHERE I NEED TIPS / DIFF PERSPECTIVES:**

I'm so sick of myself for always asking for money when I need meds bc I'm literally penniless.

I'm basically asking for money indirectly by consuming food, electricity, utilities at home. (asian, so no out of home by 18 culture tho)

Altho, same with my sister but she could always leave & not make anyone guilty if anyone asks her about it.

I'm already trying to make myself scarce so I wouldn't bother anyone with my difficult attitude (as I believe) or yapping everyone's ear out with internet trash I found.

Every time I go out of my room, it's only to go out to buy meds or when they need help with our fam business. I feel like a user freeloader.

---

I know the jokes are just jokes, half about their frustration with me, which is welcomed if it helps their mental health.

My mom jokes about begging outside our house instead with an empty can.

My youngest s. jokes on how it's ""just right to not want any stray kittens anymore because I'm unemployed & that's irresponsible"" or how my way of sharing excitedly about an artwork I found is such a chronically online & unemployed NEET behavior."" <- is ok, she's still young.

---

Whenever I'm told a snarky comeback when I try to point out on me feeling unfair, I can't form words bc my brain just blanks out in the moment from frustration.

We (my family) has a tendency to compete on who always wins or who gets the last say bc it's a 'sign of smarts & correctness'. (Mom's past mistakes, raising us via comparing & pitting against each other to 'motivate' us to do better)

Their comebacks makes sense though:

* I should just ignore when cats beg me for food or when dogs fight
* Just step on parts of the house without poop & pee
* Keep my special stuff in my room
* Instead of feeling like someone is forcing me to do these things even though nobody really told me to.

---

I know they make sense but the victim mentality is still noisy & making me get frustrated or feel unfair.

I feel like all my life, I keep pitying myself and thinking I was the scapegoat even when I'm not a kind person, I'm not the nicest and most generous that offers help or charity just because I want to.

Sure, it may seem like I'm the convenient person who accepts to do things if they can't help it, but only if it's not much hassle for me vs. theirs. Logic, easy.

---

But I'm confused if I'm feeling sad & angry because of circumstances I just dug myself into?

I'm currently ""conditioning"" myself not to victim blame bc tbh it's getting annoying that I cry in frustration everyday bc of every little thing I'm 'forced' to do even though nobody told me to.

**I want to improve myself again, or hear everybody's different takes on the situation(?)**

If you were in a similar situation, how did you get improve yourself?

Maybe I just need space (not just time) to grieve but I feel like this year I've been regressing so much that my efforts last year have been wasted. Also, I do believe my family is one of the kind/nice people out there, everyone might just have problems.

So I did it. Cold turkey as they say. At first, the withdrawals were annoying because I was always sleepy. Other than that, my cravings and mood swings were manageable.

1g9fe4g,https://i.redd.it/9rnwlaxnhawd1.jpeg,Matt & Abby Timeline ,"YOU ASKED I DELIVERED! As Matt and Abby‚Äôs travel agent they deserve to be fully presented with a visual graph on how much they truly neglect their children. All the dates are below but if you don‚Äôt want to read that long list then that is what the graph is for. I wanted to say I don‚Äôt believe I got 100% of all their outings they do post a lot and it‚Äôs possible I missed some I tried to go off the reddit sub for ones I missed as well. Also, the dates may not be completely correct as I‚Äôm Australian meaning there‚Äôs a large time difference. 

I didn‚Äôt include every time when Abby went to the gym (too many times) but I included when both ABBY and MATT went to the gym together. I also didn‚Äôt include any times they went away with their children. THIS IS ALL AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTING RESPONSIBILITIES. However, I also include times when they go away with their children, but the grandparents or great grandparents are present meaning they‚Äôre parenting G & A. Each point on the graph was from each post for example when Abby went away on a girls trip i was unsure whether to write it under flights or solo outing but with abby i just did solo outing. 

I started in June and wasn‚Äôt sure when to post this I‚Äôve been recovering from surgery meaning I‚Äôve had a lot of spare time on my hands to complete this, but everyone was talking in the comments about the calendar so no good time like the present!

I'm trying to understand if the combination of some prescription drugs I recently started taking might be responsible - not seeking medical advice, just looking for anyone with similar experiences with these medications or scientific understanding of how they could cause this.

I was taking 30mg Elvanse for ADHD in the morning for 4 days. On one of these days I drank a coffee and had a really bad reaction - significant anxiety but I would not describe it as a ""panic attack"". I was also extremely stressed and drinking alcohol on those 4 days, culminating in drinking a lot (2 bottles of wine) on Sunday. On Monday, I did not take the Elvanse but instead took 2x benzos (5mg diazepam), one at 11am and one at 6pm to avoid withdrawals so I could begin taking Elvanse again soberly from the next day. Around 6pm was when the anxiety began. It began to get so bad around 9pm I drank one can of beer. This did not help, the anxiety continued worsening, and I made myself throw up the beer.  By 11pm I was absolutely freaking out, in full panic, and considering calling an ambulance. I ended up calling a non-emergency line who called me back by 12am. They advised me to try to go to a hospital, but I was starting to feel the symptoms lessening and decided to wait, if they worsened again I would go.

By about 3am I was feeling OK and able to start getting some very patchy, interrupted sleep with horrible dreams and jumpscares at every tiny noise outside. This morning I still feel pretty anxious, partly I think I am terrified it is going to start happening again.

I know you shouldn't mix alcohol with benzos and I assumed that was what caused the reaction, but when I looked up the symptoms, it suggests the opposite - that I should have been sleepier, confused, more ""drunk"" etc. It is confusing me how benzos can be making me feel more anxious (I know they have a long half life and some is still in my system currently). I also wondered if somehow not taking the Elvanse yesterday had an impact, but again, it is a stimulant so wouldn't not taking it make me less susceptible to anxiety?

Is it possible the medications aren't even the issue here and I just happened to have a panic attack randomly, maybe because I was so overwhelmed by the weekend? ",1,1729594762.0,PanicAttack,2,1.0,False

In an effort to be positive and not cast a dark cloud over everyone as my wife claims I thought it would be refreshing to celebrate the finer things in ELT.  What are some of the things you enjoy or your highlights so far. 

Here are a few of mine. 

1: Coming into the staffroom on the first morning break and finding the cleaning ladies laying out plates of pineapple, starfruit and dragon fruit for the teachers to eat.  It was great. 

2: When I was a manager and my desk was in the staffroom.  I loved it when some of the people I managed were sat around together planning lessons and helping each other. 

3: Staffroom banter.  The insider TEFL jokes, the language jokes, puns and pranks.  It makes a huge difference and I miss working in big staffrooms with lots of interesting colleagues. 

4: This is specific to Hanoi.  The Saturday/Sunday lunchtime massive Joma delivery.  Around 25 Bagel Eggers being delivered with coffee.  I used to use my Vietnammm account and order for everyone so I got to keep the points HAHAHA!!! 

5: Getting your first ELT job that pays well.  

6:  The first batch of lessons you do post-CELTA and start enjoying the fact there isn't a person at the back of the room with a clipboard who is constantly judging you.   

7: When you start your first job as a Teacher Trainer and you give one of your trainees an Above Standard and you feel so proud of them, then you steal all their ideas for your next class :-) 

8: When a student corrects you and you appreciate the fact that they are thinking critically.  The look on their face when you compliment them and say thank you for pointing that out.  

9: When you meet your friends back in your home country or when someone comes to visit you.

10: When your students track you down on Social Media years later to say thank you and then tell you they are a Doctor or they've done something cool.  

11: I met my wife doing this job and for that I am truly thankful then she went off and got a Pass A on her CELTA and she's been lording it over me ever since. 

Lastly, I always liked being observed by CELTA trainees and then having a chat with them afterwards.  Sometimes their questions would get me to reconsider why I didn't do something or how I could've done it better.  ",2,1729594203.0,TEFL,0,0.63,False

It's not that I didn‚Äôt try, but an experience I had years ago really impacted me negatively. Around 2017-18, right after finishing my SSC exams, I got my first phone and started connecting with people on Facebook, including friends from my coaching center. I wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in any of the girls I knew at the time until one day I saw a post from one of them, hanging out with a friend. Her friend caught my attention, so I sent a friend request, and we started chatting casually.

At the time, I had no intention of pursuing anything romantic‚Äîjust friendly conversation. One evening, we were texting back and forth, and I shared a song I was really into: Arrival of the Birds. For reasons I still don‚Äôt understand, she became really hostile and called me a creep before blocking me. That one word hit hard, and since then, it‚Äôs been difficult for me to engage with women socially. I struggle with anxiety when talking to them, even making eye contact feels like a challenge. It wasn‚Äôt about looks or anything superficial‚ÄîI'd probably rate myself around a 6 or 6.5 out of 10‚Äîbut the fear of being judged stayed with me.

Fast forward to now, and I think things might be changing. I‚Äôm preparing to go abroad next year for higher studies, and recently, I had an experience that surprised me. While working with an agency for my documents, they asked if I could help deliver another applicant‚Äôs documents since we live in the same area. At first, I hesitated, but I agreed. I met up with her, expecting to just grab the documents and leave quickly. But instead, she invited me to have coffee with her. I was nervous and tried to politely decline, but she insisted.

To my surprise, it turned out to be a good experience. She led the conversation initially, but after a while, I pushed myself to engage more, and we ended up having a nice time. It was the first time I‚Äôd had a real conversation with a girl in a casual setting, and I realized that the fear I‚Äôve been carrying for so long might be starting to fade.

I don‚Äôt have any romantic feelings for her, and she seemed to treat everyone kindly, but it was a huge step for me in overcoming my anxiety. Now, I‚Äôm wondering how I can continue to break free from this fear and build healthier social interactions going forward.

Any advice on how to keep growing in this area?",3,1729594030.0,Dhaka,2,1.0,False

*I've been struggling a little to find time to grieve and find a job quick bc of my home situation (at least i think).*

*In my perspective, my fam isn't willing to take responsibility for most of their actions & rely on a good samaritan (or bothered soul; me) to fix it*. *But I also feel like I'm wrong.*

Or at least, it's my opinion only ‚Äî I feel like a victim & are having doubts about my feelings (explained below).

So far, my 'luck' has been bad and I also lost my cat this year, which left me in debt as it needed emergency medical treatment and dried up my savings.

---

# NOTE: LONG POST!!

There's much things that's happened bc we're a big family. We're 7 in the fam & live with some of our employees (10?)

---

**ON MY SAVINGS:**  
I only started my first actual job last year but it was bad timing.

I couldn't handle my brain being overwhelmed everyday on the choice of:

* Help care for Dad
* Continue Work
   * a little toxic and time-consuming, but genuinely fulfilling
   * wfh, underpaid, overtime for deadlines, one-man department, startup company

I decided to quit bc work planned more projects for me as protege(?) & my brain can't help frustration of eating convenience store food, 4 hours sleep, & general unawareness of work that project deliverables need at least a month for planning, creating, and executing vs. 1-2 weeks.

---

**HOME SITUATION:**

I took care of my dad as the night-shift caregiver bc I was the only one who's able to handle missing sleep or sleeping less than 6 hours). Also bc I recently quit so not busy.

Now that dad's passed, our semi-public home is home again for our whole family except:

* Eldest sister's (F29) brought her SO + their 6 dogs. We already have many dogs & 2 cats (my youngest sister's, F19).
* Her dogs not properly trained (poo&pee in the house uncleaned) & can't dog(??)
* Have unfixed females that got their heat recently hence my lack of sleep since 6 weeks ago (aside from sleep debt from caregiving)

I already warned them (failed) 3 days before this bc the dogs were getting restless.

The 6 weeks consecutive was just filled with dog fights inside the house at random times.

I'm one of 2 people who successfully grabs the big dogs while they're mauling each other without visibly panicking.

Walls are thin so even if my room was corner side, you can hear any scream or general laughter clearly.

The couple (sis+SO) go overseas for work a lot (events) so that too, default left to people in the house to help if dogs fought.

---

**ME SITUATION:**

I'm a psych grad, so I prioritize mental wellbeing & non-chaos as much as possible.

I have pending dx of ASD or maybe cPTSD wc needs a therapist once I get a job. But I think I'm a little well-adjusted / well-socialized enough to not need diagnoses anyway.

I am the lightest-sleeper (can't sleep once woken after 1-2 hrs.)

I'm a little predictable.

* I'm the only one in our house to wear Plain White shirts and Nike Shorts in different colors everyday.
* I use one slipper/shoes (the only white crocs in the house too) to go out.
* I have 3 uniquely shaped mugs/tumblers that I personally wash & keep in a high cabinet that are distinctly unique from our uniform mugs (tons, bc mom collects).

---

**FOR MOM**

These last 6 weeks felt like my body was couldn't keep burning more oil anymore.

* Mom requested I undergo a hormone therapy for my amenorrhea this month for her sanity & I accept bc I understand this as her grieving.
* I try to understand my siblings' jittery attitudes bc I also give myself space to grieve for a year, so it's just fair to them.

I'm trying my best to adjust to a new lifestyle governed by symptoms from hormone fluctuations & monthly bleeding, **it's very new and a first to me**.

My body aches, my brain is overwhelmed (i think) from grieving, finding a job, bleeding, and trying to make sense why time seemed to pass by too quickly & I can't remember much anymore which worries me + adds to problems.

---

**ON ELDEST SISTER:**

Within those 6 weeks, aside from dogfights, my eldest sister hosted 2 visitors. She used my mug collection twice, to serve coffee.

I asked her if she used it in a flat tone (to not trigger)

(1st time) she said nobody answered when she asked \[i just woke up to also make my cup\]

(2nd) she claimed it was her new tumbler's straw (even when it was yellowing)

I laid out evidence, yellowing clear straw with abrasion marks & my cup was the only clear SB tumbler, she stayed quiet & started a topic with guest & SO.

Ignoring? So, I told her not to do so next time, & told her I'll understand *this time* specially since these take quite the effort to actually get (i place them in the highest cupboard away from the eyes) ‚Äî

She just raised her tone a little and told me to just stop repeating bc ""I didn't know okay, geez. (You) keep creating problems being cranky in the morning.""

---

**ON YOUNGEST:**

My only slipper also went missing for more than a week only to find my youngest s. had been using it.

I had to (beg) ask my mom for her spare slipper bc our compound is literally an outdoors area. Need to walk to get to buildings.

When asked flatly, she just told me ""I thought it was ....'s"" <- mumbled,

Me: ""Whose?"",

Her: \*mumbles before running away to buy her chickens' food.\*

I asked my mom to help me tell her that I was upset from the lack of acknowledgement of her mistake.

I used to have anger issues or bad mouth / mean words as a child. Probable ASD symptom.

I didn't expect sorry's I only wanted her to admit she made a mistake as proof that she's now aware I was upset. Today she's completely ignoring me.

So I just told her concisely *early in the morning* that

* I just fed her cats their last bowl of food
* Cats no food for dinner if not bought today
* She should be the one to ask mom for money this time
* She should buy it this time because I always do it (due to her having school, but she didn't have classes today)

Answer is silence. I just took it as a yes & respected her boundaries.

I reminded her in our group chat bc i saw her talking about buying dog food for my sister's dog after lunch.

Our driver only works until 5pm, and 4pm she still hasn't moved an inch from her room. It takes 30 minutes to buy cat food.

---

**WHERE I NEED TIPS / DIFF PERSPECTIVES:**

I'm so sick of myself for always asking for money when I need meds bc I'm literally penniless.

I'm basically asking for money indirectly by consuming food, electricity, utilities at home. (asian, so no out of home by 18 culture tho)

Altho, same with my sister but she could always leave & not make anyone guilty if anyone asks her about it.

I'm already trying to make myself scarce so I wouldn't bother anyone with my difficult attitude (as I believe) or yapping everyone's ear out with internet trash I found.

Every time I go out of my room, it's only to go out to buy meds or when they need help with our fam business. I feel like a user freeloader.

---

I know the jokes are just jokes, half about their frustration with me, which is welcomed if it helps their mental health.

My mom jokes about begging outside our house instead with an empty can.

My youngest s. jokes on how it's ""just right to not want any stray kittens anymore because I'm unemployed & that's irresponsible"" or how my way of sharing excitedly about an artwork I found is such a chronically online & unemployed NEET behavior."" <- is ok, she's still young.

---

Whenever I'm told a snarky comeback when I try to point out on me feeling unfair, I can't form words bc my brain just blanks out in the moment from frustration.

We (my family) has a tendency to compete on who always wins or who gets the last say bc it's a 'sign of smarts & correctness'. (Mom's past mistakes, raising us via comparing & pitting against each other to 'motivate' us to do better)

Their comebacks makes sense though:

* I should just ignore when cats beg me for food or when dogs fight
* Just step on parts of the house without poop & pee
* Keep my special stuff in my room
* Instead of feeling like someone is forcing me to do these things even though nobody really told me to.

---

I know they make sense but the victim mentality is still noisy & making me get frustrated or feel unfair.

I feel like all my life, I keep pitying myself and thinking I was the scapegoat even when I'm not a kind person, I'm not the nicest and most generous that offers help or charity just because I want to.

Sure, it may seem like I'm the convenient person who accepts to do things if they can't help it, but only if it's not much hassle for me vs. theirs. Logic, easy.

---

But I'm confused if I'm feeling sad & angry because of circumstances I just dug myself into?

I need help in trying to convince myself not to victim blame bc tbh it's getting annoying that I cry in frustration everyday bc of every little thing I'm 'forced' to do and I'm losing sleep over it too.

**I want to improve myself again, maybe get myself disciplined, or hear everybody's different takes on the situation. If you were in a similar situation, how did you get improve yourself?**

Maybe I just need space (not just time) to grieve but I feel like this year I've been regressing so much that my efforts last year have been wasted.",0,1729593358.0,selfimprovement,0,0.5,False

Since 1 year I have a Sage (Breville) Barista Pro and I must say that I am quite happy with it. Clearly I always look up to your much more elaborate cooffee stations, but I would like to go step by step.  
Initially I tried a lot of Speciality coffee (following the fashion), but I simply waste a lot of money without ever having a ‚Äúgood coffee‚Äù (for my taste of course).  
These trials served me to realize that I like classic Italian - Style coffee and do not tolerate acidity in coffee at all.  
After the shock with the Speciality Coffees I started using beans from a local company (but external roastery) that if I am not mistaken have 70% Arabica and 30% Robusta and I am doing well, I like the coffee, but I am always looking for new coffees and to improve my experience.

To improve my experience, I was thinking of upgrading and buying a new grinder. I would like to go for the Italian brand Eureka, but I am undecided on which model to buy. I would aim for something rather definitive and that will not make me regret the purchase maybe in 2 years.

As anticipated the coffee I prefer is Italian - Style, I do not make many coffees, max 4 or 6 per day, almost exclusively espresso or rarely some cappuccino. So far I have been very comfortable using the Single Dose technique to get consistency, and I think I would like to keep this workflow. Since I am still inexperienced, however, I would like to leave all possibilities open, so my idea would be to get a grinder with a hopper and possibly convert it to Single Dose, so eventually I can go back.

Is my idea wrong?

The model that would most appeal to me at the moment is the Mignon XL, and I think for my needs it is a grinder that will last me over time. I have also seen the Libra model which is supposed to make the workflow faster, however, I am afraid that given the few coffees I make, the beans in the hopper will get old.  
However, I can't tell if I would feel much difference, for example, compared to a Mignon Specialit√† (which costs much less than an XL).

do you have any advice?

Thank you very much

But there‚Äôs something about mystery that pulls you in, and before you know it, you‚Äôre in too deep. That‚Äôs exactly what happened with Lila. I met her one rainy afternoon, under the awning of a little coffee shop I‚Äôd never noticed before.

It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be a memorable day. In fact, everything had been utterly ordinary. Work was the same dull routine; my boss had complained about the same things he always did. I went through the motions, and by 6 p.m., all I wanted was a quiet cup of coffee before heading home to my boring apartment.

I ducked into the coffee shop because it was pouring outside, and I hadn‚Äôt brought an umbrella. The place was almost empty, except for her. She sat by the window, looking out into the street, her fingers tracing the rim of a coffee cup that seemed to have gone cold a long time ago.

She was beautiful, in that classic, old-movie kind of way. There was something timeless about her. I didn‚Äôt want to stare, but it was hard not to. Something about her just drew me in. So, I ordered my coffee, and when the barista handed me my cup, I found myself walking over to her table, half expecting her to look up and tell me she was waiting for someone. Instead, she just smiled. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting for you,‚Äù she said.

It felt like a line out of some cheesy romance novel, but the way she said it, so calm and certain, made me freeze. I had no idea what to say. Had I met her before? Was she mistaking me for someone else?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, do we‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she cut me off. ‚ÄúBut we will.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh, feeling a little thrown off but intrigued. I sat down across from her, and just like that, it felt like the most natural thing in the world. We talked for hours, about nothing and everything at once. I learned that she liked old records and rainy days. She told me she loved walking the city at night, when the streets were quiet and everyone else was asleep. But the weird thing was, she never talked about herself. Not really. She asked me a hundred questions, made me feel like I was the most interesting person in the world. But every time I tried to turn the conversation back to her, she‚Äôd change the subject.

By the time I realized how late it was, the rain had stopped, and the coffee shop was closing. We said goodbye, and as I watched her walk away, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that there was something more to her. Something just out of reach.

Over the next few weeks, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about her. I went back to that coffee shop every day, hoping I‚Äôd run into her again. And then, finally, on a Tuesday afternoon, there she was, sitting in the same spot by the window, her coffee untouched.

‚ÄúI knew you‚Äôd come back,‚Äù she said when I sat down.

From that day on, it became a routine. We‚Äôd meet at the coffee shop, always in the late afternoon, always after the rain. We‚Äôd talk for hours, and then she‚Äôd disappear, never giving me her number or telling me where she lived. It was strange, but I didn‚Äôt care. I was falling for her. Hard.

But then, things started getting‚Ä¶ weird.

One night, after one of our usual coffee dates, I decided to walk her home. It had been raining, of course, and the streets were slick with water, reflecting the dull glow of the streetlights. Lila walked beside me, silent for the first time since we‚Äôd met. She seemed distant, her eyes fixed ahead, like she was looking at something only she could see.

‚ÄúWhere do you live, anyway?‚Äù I asked, half-joking. ‚ÄúYou never let me walk you home.‚Äù

She glanced at me, her smile fading slightly. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Try me.‚Äù

She hesitated, biting her lip like she was trying to find the right words. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like where you live,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really explain it. I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶ from here.‚Äù

I laughed, but it came out awkward. ‚ÄúWhat, like you‚Äôre from another city or something?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt laugh. Instead, she stopped walking, and for the first time, she looked nervous. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to explain,‚Äù she repeated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not from here. Not from now.‚Äù

I blinked, trying to process what she was saying. ‚ÄúWait, what are you talking about?‚Äù

She sighed, turning to face me fully. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason I never tell you much about myself. I‚Äôm not like you. I don‚Äôt belong here, not in this time, not in this world.‚Äù

I stared at her, trying to decide if she was messing with me. But the look on her face told me she was serious. Dead serious.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ stuck,‚Äù she said finally. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been stuck for a long time. And you‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre the first person who‚Äôs ever noticed me.‚Äù

I felt a chill run down my spine. ‚ÄúStuck? In time?‚Äù

She nodded, her eyes glistening with something that looked like sadness. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting, waiting for someone like you. Someone who could see me. You‚Äôre the only one who ever has.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know what to say. My mind was racing, trying to make sense of it all. It didn‚Äôt make any sense, but at the same time, I couldn‚Äôt deny the pull I felt toward her, the strange connection between us that I couldn‚Äôt explain.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been here,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúTime doesn‚Äôt work the same way for me. But every once in a while, someone comes along, someone who can see me. And when that happens‚Ä¶ I get to live again. For a little while.‚Äù

I felt like I was in a dream, like the world around us had faded away, and it was just me and her, standing in the middle of the empty street.

‚ÄúWhat happens when I stop seeing you?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

She looked down, her expression softening. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But I‚Äôm afraid that if you do, I‚Äôll disappear. For good.‚Äù

The weight of her words hung between us, heavy and unspoken. I wanted to tell her that I‚Äôd never stop seeing her, that I‚Äôd find a way to fix whatever was wrong, but the truth was, I didn‚Äôt know what I was dealing with.

For the next few days, I couldn‚Äôt get her out of my mind. We kept meeting at the coffee shop, but something had changed. There was a tension now, a sense of urgency. I could feel her slipping away, like she was fading right in front of me.

And then, one night, she didn‚Äôt show up.

I waited for hours, but she never came. I went back the next day, and the day after that, but there was no sign of her. It was like she had never existed.

Except I knew she had.

I still go back to that coffee shop sometimes, hoping that maybe, just maybe, I‚Äôll see her again. I don‚Äôt know what happened to her, or if I‚Äôll ever see her again, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that she‚Äôs still out there somewhere, waiting.

And sometimes, late at night, when the rain is falling just right, I swear I can hear her voice, soft and distant, calling my name.

But there‚Äôs something about mystery that pulls you in, and before you know it, you‚Äôre in too deep. That‚Äôs exactly what happened with Lila. I met her one rainy afternoon, under the awning of a little coffee shop I‚Äôd never noticed before.

It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be a memorable day. In fact, everything had been utterly ordinary. Work was the same dull routine; my boss had complained about the same things he always did. I went through the motions, and by 6 p.m., all I wanted was a quiet cup of coffee before heading home to my boring apartment.

I ducked into the coffee shop because it was pouring outside, and I hadn‚Äôt brought an umbrella. The place was almost empty, except for her. She sat by the window, looking out into the street, her fingers tracing the rim of a coffee cup that seemed to have gone cold a long time ago.

She was beautiful, in that classic, old-movie kind of way. There was something timeless about her. I didn‚Äôt want to stare, but it was hard not to. Something about her just drew me in. So, I ordered my coffee, and when the barista handed me my cup, I found myself walking over to her table, half expecting her to look up and tell me she was waiting for someone. Instead, she just smiled. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting for you,‚Äù she said.

It felt like a line out of some cheesy romance novel, but the way she said it, so calm and certain, made me freeze. I had no idea what to say. Had I met her before? Was she mistaking me for someone else?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, do we‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she cut me off. ‚ÄúBut we will.‚Äù

1g9ew3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g9ew3v/i_found_a_strange_door_in_my_sons_bedroom/,I Found A Strange Door In My Son's Bedroom,"My two-year-old son Carter has always been what the doctors called a *‚Äònormal toddler.‚Äô* Like any other kid his age, he sometimes had tantrums or splattered his food all over the wall; occasionally he caught a fever from eating God-knows-what or refused to go to sleep until after midnight. What comforted my wife Anabel and I was the knowledge that all of that was *normal.* By and large, our son was healthy, happy, and growing more every day‚Äì

Until he woke up screaming four nights ago.¬†

At first, I thought it had to do with the move. We had recently transitioned from a cramped apartment in the city to a two-storey house in the suburbs. The whole neighborhood had been built in the 1950‚Äôs, and it showed: every one of the homes was eerily similar to each of the others, and all of them needed repairs. Still, the bones of the structure were solid. So what if there were a few leaks in the basement? So what if the lights didn‚Äôt work in the upstairs hallway? The important thing was that our little family finally had a place that we could call our own.

Or so I thought. The truth was, Anabel and I were both expecting that Carter would have trouble adjusting to our new home; we had read books about children whose personalities changed or even suffered trauma as a result of being suddenly uprooted from a familiar environment, but Carter was thrilled by the change. He zoomed through the house, yelling excitedly into every closet and cupboard. To us, the worn old house felt small, but for our son, it must have seemed like the biggest playground ever. He slept twelve hours that night, and Anabel and I finally got some time alone.¬†

Carter was just as enchanted by the house on the second day. While Anabel and I unpacked, he built forts with cardboard boxes or climbed around inside the kitchen cabinets. We let Carter pick his bedroom, and he chose the smaller room on the left. When I asked him why, he just grinned.

*‚ÄúFunny doors!‚Äù* Carter laughed, then ran away without any further explanation. I was left scratching my head. My son‚Äôs room had only *one* door, the one that led to the hallway and to the bedroom I would be sharing with Anabel. Why had Carter said *‚Äòdoors‚Äô*? I figured that it was just toddler logic, and forgot all about it.

My wife traveled a lot for work, but she had taken a week off to help with the move. Since he showed every sign of being well-adjusted, she left for her first business trip last Monday‚Äì

And that‚Äôs where the trouble started.¬†

It had been a perfectly ordinary night: beef stew for dinner, bathtime, pajamas, storytime, and sleep. While Carter dozed, I wrapped up in the cozy plaid bathrobe that Anabel had bought me last Father‚Äôs Day, and read an old Raymond Chandler novel until I felt sleepy enough to turn out the light.¬†

A piercing shriek woke me. *Carter.* The digital alarm clock beside my bed read 1:44 AM. I stumbled out of bed and down the lightless hallway to my son‚Äôs room. I found him standing in his crib, pointing at the wall and screaming. This wasn‚Äôt teething pain, hunger, or a stomachache: this was pure, unfiltered terror.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, buddy?‚Äù I asked as I picked him up. ‚ÄúDoes something hurt? Did you have a nightmare?‚Äù¬†

*‚ÄúDaa-run,‚Äù* Carter mumbled, over and over. *‚ÄúBaa-maa, Daa-run.‚Äù*

My son can usually speak complete words without a problem, but he was too agitated that night. It took ten minutes of rocking just to stop the screaming, and even then, I still couldn‚Äôt make out what he was trying to say through his tears. I offered water, a snack, and even told him that he could stay with me in the big bed if he wanted, but Carter just shook his head. There didn‚Äôt seem to be any option except to lay him back in his crib.

My son grabbed his favorite stuffed animal‚Äìa fat purple gecko‚Äìand rolled over, staring at the wall like his life depended on it. After a few minutes, his eyes closed, his breathing regulated, and I could finally get back to sleep.

Although Anabel wasn‚Äôt around to witness the weird event, I mentioned it during our video call the next evening. Her advice was simple: give it one more night. If something else happened, I could move Carter‚Äôs crib into our bedroom or set up the baby cam that we had quit using several months before.¬†

That second night was the first time that Carter had ever seemed nervous about going to bed. Even while I was giving him his bath, he kept craning his neck to look behind me, as though he were afraid some monster was going to come creeping in from the hallway. Even after I shut the bathroom door, his tiny fingers kept a white knuckle grip on the edge of the tub‚Äì

Like he was waiting for something terrible to happen.¬†

‚ÄúJust holler if you need anything, okay buddy?‚Äù I reminded him, before ruffling his hair and turning out the light. ‚ÄúSleep tight!‚Äù¬†

When I got back to my bedroom, I couldn‚Äôt help but look back over my shoulder. Carter was just a black lump in the crib on the far wall. He looked so small and fragile, clinging to his purple gecko plushie like his life depended on it. I wanted to stay by his side, but I knew that I couldn‚Äôt be there every night, and that some battles he would have to learn to fight alone.¬†

I lay in bed staring at the ceiling fan, too restless to sleep. I was waiting, I realized, for my son to scream. After 1:45 AM passed without a sound from Carter‚Äôs room, I finally relaxed. Maybe it had just been a nightmare, after all.

At some point I must have dozed off, because when my eyes opened, it was to the sound of my son‚Äôs piercing cry.¬†

Just like before, I ran to Carter‚Äìbut what I saw in the hallway stopped me in my tracks. It was‚Ä¶*me.* Standing in the dimly-lit doorway of my son‚Äôs room. This version of me had wild hair, bloodshot eyes, and an enraged expression on its face.¬†

‚ÄúHEY!‚Äù I shouted, sprinting forward. My other self moved too, and only then did I realize that I was looking at a mirror. *There was a full-length mirror on the back of Carter‚Äôs bedroom door!* I had never noticed it before, but then again, we had moved in so recently. A cheap mirror on the back of a door would have been an easy thing for the old owners to forget, and since Anabel and I rarely opened Carter‚Äôs door all the way, we might have simply overlooked it.

Maybe that had been the problem: my son was waking up in the middle of the night and getting scared by his own reflection. As much as I wanted to believe it, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder what had opened the door. Something else was bothering me, too: Carter‚Äôs stuffed purple gecko was gone. Sometimes he threw it out of the crib, where it usually bounced under the mattress or got lost in the laundry, but that night, the plushie was nowhere to be found.¬†

‚ÄúBaa-maa!‚Äù Carter was rambling again. ‚ÄúDaarum!‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt making any more sense than he had the day before, but at least he calmed down faster. He reached out for his crib like he couldn‚Äôt wait to get back inside of it and hide beneath the covers; anything else I offered him only made that horrible wailing start up again.

Although I didn‚Äôt like the way he lay there‚Äìthe sheet half-covering his face like a murder victim in a mortuary‚Äìit seemed to be the only thing keeping him calm and relaxed. He was hiding, I realized with a shiver. Hoping that whatever had scared him so badly wouldn‚Äôt find him before the morning.

The dark hallway connecting our rooms was also colder than I remembered. I put on the striped bathrobe that Anabel had bought me last Father‚Äôs Day and lay down on my bed to read. I wanted to get lost in those dusty yellowed pages, but I just couldn‚Äôt focus: for one thing, my bookmark wasn‚Äôt where I remembered leaving it; I had to go back almost ten pages just to remember what was going on. For another, I would have sworn that my bathrobe had been *plaid,* not striped. No matter how many times I paced the bedroom or peeked out the door to make sure that Carter was safe, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of wrongness that had burrowed down deep into my gut.¬†

During my video call with Anabel the next day, I was almost afraid to mention the whole episode. She still had a full day left in her business trip, and I didn‚Äôt want her to think that I was losing my grip on things back home. I asked about the mirror, but she said she couldn‚Äôt remember seeing one in Carter‚Äôs room. Later, when I mentioned the bathrobe, an odd expression crossed her face.

‚ÄúThe truth is, I couldn‚Äôt decide. I had narrowed it down to those two patterns, but I was running late, so I just closed my eyes and picked one at random. It turned out to be stripes, but it could just as easily have been plaid.‚Äù Anabel hesitated. ‚Äú...Anyway, about Carter, why don‚Äôt you just set up the baby monitor? That way you‚Äôll know for sure what‚Äôs going on in there.‚Äù¬†

We still hadn‚Äôt fully unpacked, and it took me a while to locate the tiny camera that we had used to watch Carter when he was a newborn. I set it up on a chair facing his crib, and while I was at it, I also took down the mirror. I couldn‚Äôt explain why, but the damn thing gave me a bad vibe‚Äìlike it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there. Like it didn‚Äôt really belong in *‚Äòour‚Äô* house.¬†

Just like the night before, Carter became unusually quiet after sunset. He kept his eyes glued to the clock, nervously counting down the minutes until nightfall. I tried to distract him with his favorite game‚ÄìHide and Seek‚Äìbut he didn‚Äôt want to leave my side. I could understand why: without Anabel around, the house felt too quiet. Our voices echoed strangely in the half-empty rooms, and I think we were both relieved when it was finally time for bed.¬†

Carter rolled over to look at the wall as soon as I laid him in his crib. I had the unsettling thought that he was just pretending to sleep, but I was too exhausted from the day to do anything about it. I skipped my nightly routine, instead taking a shot of bourbon to calm my nerves and sitting down in front of the computer monitor. From there, I could watch the night-vision footage from the room at the end of the hall.¬†

At first, there was nothing to see but Carter tossing and turning in his sleep, his hands grasping unconsciously for his missing toy. I poured myself another shot. When I looked back at the screen, my son‚Äôs eyes were wide open. In the dark, they looked like two black, empty pits. His jaw dropped in terror at the sight of something behind the camera‚Äì

Something that I couldn‚Äôt see.¬†

The camera fell to the floor with a crash. My son disappeared from view. I fumbled uselessly for a weapon, and‚Äìfinding none‚Äìran down the hallway empty handed. What I found on the other side of the tightly-closed door was the last thing I expected. My son was sleeping peacefully: only the camera had been disturbed. It lay on its side, its wiry plastic guts scattered across the hardwood. Beside it was Carter‚Äôs stuffed purple gecko.¬†

Was it possible that my son had found his stuffed animal, hurled it across the room to destroy our nanny cam, then fallen back asleep immediately? Maybe. It was even the most logical explanation‚Ä¶but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to believe it. The more I tried to convince myself, the more certain I was that there was an intruder in my son‚Äôs room.¬†

Almost unwillingly, I turned my head from side to side, searching. My eyes fixed on the wall beside me, the one Carter had been looking at in the video. There was a second doorway there.

I blinked. To my right was the hallway I had come from; I could see the soft yellow light of my bedside lamp glowing beneath the door. To my left was another hallway, one that I was sure hadn‚Äôt been there a few hours ago. It looked as lightless and empty as the void of space.¬†

Was that what my son had been trying to say? *‚ÄúDaarum‚Ä¶dark room?‚Äù* If so, what did *‚Äúbaa maa‚Äù* mean? I was curious, because now that I thought about it, Carter‚Äôs words had sounded an awful lot like *‚Äúbad man.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDark room. Bad man.‚Äù* I shuddered.¬†

Before I could decide what to do about the impossible doorway, I heard footsteps approaching from the other side. I glanced down at my son, sleeping soundly. Whatever was out there, the most important thing was protecting Carter. I scooped him up from his crib and rushed back to my own bedroom. While Carter squirmed and asked what was going on, I barred the door with a chair, pressed my eye to the keyhole, and listened.¬†

A man-sized figure stood in the doorway of Carter‚Äôs room. It hesitated for a moment, then charged. Between its speed and the darkness, I couldn‚Äôt make out any of its features, but whatever it was, it was strong. It shook the door handle so hard that I thought it would rip it clear out of the wood; when that didn‚Äôt work, it started slamming its bulk furiously against the door.¬†

The first impact made the door rattle on its hinges; the second splintered the wood. I doubted the door would survive a third. I had already dialed the police; I left the phone on speaker mode while I grabbed Carter, covered his mouth with my hand, and crawled beneath the bed. It was a silly, obvious place to hide, but it was all I could think of to do.¬†

‚ÄúShhh.‚Äù I begged my son. We hid in silence as *‚Äú9-1-1, what‚Äôs your emergency‚Äù* became *‚Äúremain on the line, and the nearest available officer will respond to your call.‚Äù*

The lock held‚Äìfor a little while, at least. A final blow sent the chair I had braced it with flying across the room; I could hear ragged, panting breaths in the darkness. The floorboards groaned beneath heavy footsteps. I held Carter close and prepared for the worst.

*Sirens!* My eyes snapped open. Flashing red-and-blue lights poured in through the windows. The intruder froze, muttered something in disbelief, then fled back down the hallway. From the first floor I heard urgent knocking; shouts of *‚Äúpolice!‚Äù* and *‚Äúopen up!‚Äù* reverberated through the house. I hurried downstairs with Carter before they could kick in the door. The officers cleared the whole house, but there was no sign of any intruder‚Äìor the strange doorway.¬†

I didn‚Äôt mention Carter‚Äôs *‚Äúdark room‚Äù* in the report I filed. I didn‚Äôt want to risk being deemed mentally incompetent or a danger to my son; the officers were already suspicious of the bourbon on my breath. The only thing to support my story was my bedroom door, which hung from its splintered hinges like a drunk clinging to a lamppost‚Äìand of course, I could have done that myself. More than anything, I missed Anabel. Fortunately, I would be picking her up from the airport in just a few hours. As the sun came up, I fed Carter his oatmeal and booked us a bland, boring hotel room for the next two days. There was no way in hell I was going to risk my son‚Äôs life by spending another night in that house.¬†

I packed as quickly as I could, sure that I had forgotten at least half the things that my son needed for two days out of the house. I kept getting distracted: what if I glanced up from the suitcase and found that Carter‚Äìor the closet door‚Äìhad disappeared? What if, when we tried to leave, the house didn‚Äôt let us? I gripped Carter‚Äôs wrist and kept my eyes straight ahead as we marched out of the house. If some awful grinning face was watching us from the upstairs window, I didn‚Äôt want to know about it.

After the engine started, I could breathe again. We were going to make it. It was raining when we picked Anabel up from the airport, a gray misty rain that made everything that had happened in the last few days feel somehow less real. My wife looked dubiously at the half-zipped suitcases stuffed into the backseat, then at Carter‚Äôs confused, tear-streaked face. She didn‚Äôt say anything, but I could tell she wasn‚Äôt convinced by my story. It hurt, but I couldn‚Äôt say I blamed her. After all, which was more likely? That stress from work, a move, and caring for a toddler had caused a mental breakdown? Or that a portal to nowhere had opened up in a boring suburban home? The only question now was whether Anabel would stay by my side in spite of her doubts, or try to get as far away from me as possible.¬†

When we entered the lobby of the hotel I‚Äôd booked, my heart was in my throat: if she asked the desk clerk to call Child Protective Services or alert the authorities, there would be nothing I could do: I would be locked away until my name was cleared‚Ä¶and Anabel would be free to take Carter back to *that house*. I could sense her doubt as we walked up to the front desk, but all Anabel did was smile and ask for the keys. My wife had chosen to stand by me.¬†

So what if the air smelled like burnt coffee and cleaning supplies? So what if the ice machine‚Äôs rattle went right through the paper thin walls? As far as I was concerned, the hotel room meant *safety.* It meant an end to sleepless nights spent running down that lightless hallway, unsure of what I might find on the far end. I could have cried for joy. I dumped the suitcases and threw myself onto one of the ugly beds. Carter climbed up too, giggling and tickling me; for a few seconds, I could almost pretend we were a normal, happy family again.¬†

Anabel, however, stayed silent.¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I whispered, after we had turned on the television to distract Carter.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶‚Äù my wife hesitated. ‚Äú...you‚Äôre different.‚Äù

‚ÄúDifferent?‚Äù I peeked through the bathroom door at the mirror: my hair was a mess and there were dark circles under my eyes, but none of that was news to me. ‚ÄúDifferent how?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know!‚Äù Anabel shouted so loudly that Carter looked up from his cartoons. She brought a hand to her forehead. ‚ÄúAll this is just a lot, okay? I need time.‚Äù¬†

Until that moment, I hadn‚Äôt had a plan, but what I needed to do was suddenly crystal clear.¬†

‚ÄúI understand. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm going back to the house tonight.‚Äù

My wife opened her mouth to protest, but I shook my head.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better for all of us this way.‚Äù¬†

Carter had turned back to the TV screen, where a frightened white rabbit was running up an endless flight of stairs, pursued by an ax-wielding devil wearing a jester‚Äôs cap. I had never seen the program before, and while it was probably supposed to be funny, under the circumstances it sent a shiver up my spine. I picked up my overnight bag, gave Anabel a kiss on the cheek, then left the hotel room.¬†

Terror seized me the moment the door closed. What if I had made an unforgivable mistake? I was suddenly sure that if I opened the door again, I would discover that my wife and child had vanished, swallowed by whatever strangeness was pursuing our family. I had to know. I fumbled with the key card, tugging on the door handle desperately while that damned little light flashed red again and again. When I finally crashed inside, I found Anabel with one arm around Carter‚Äôs shoulder. She was ready to protect him, but not from any horror movie monster: she was ready to protect him‚Ä¶from me.¬†

‚Äú....Sorry,‚Äù I stammered. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶just‚Ä¶forgot something‚Ä¶‚Äù The nearest thing at hand was a free disposable coffee cup: I grabbed it and stumbled back out into the hotel like a sleepwalker.¬†

Since Anabel would need the car, I took a taxi home. The rain was coming down harder than ever, but it felt like the driver spent more time checking me out in the rearview mirror than watching the road.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I demanded, when he finally came to a stop in my driveway.

‚ÄúNothin,‚Äù the man looked down at the meter. ‚ÄúForty-two seventy-five, please.‚Äù¬†

I stuffed a fifty into his hand and told him to keep the change.¬†

Inside, the house felt far too quiet. The taxi driver was still idling in my driveway‚Ä¶almost like he was waiting for me to change my mind. What had he seen, what had he been staring at so intently in the rearview mirror? I closed the blinds and tiptoed upstairs. I wished that I‚Äôd brought something to protect myself with‚Äìeven just a kitchen knife or a hammer‚Äìbut it was too late now. The door to Carter‚Äôs room stood wide open at the end of the hall.¬†

I didn‚Äôt really expect the mysterious corridor to be there waiting for me, but I was almost disappointed to discover that my son‚Äôs room was just an ordinary bedroom. Four white walls, bare hardwood floors, big wide windows. Would it remain that way after nightfall? There was only one way to find out. I started making my preparations right away.

Around dinner time I called to check up on Anabel and Carter. They were both fine‚Äìif a little shaken up. Carter had enjoyed exploring the hotel and splashing in the pool; they had gotten Chinese takeout for dinner. When I told my wife what I was planning, her reply was immediate:

‚ÄúI really wish you wouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù I demanded. ‚ÄúWhat do you think is going to happen?‚Äù¬†

Carter hooted excitedly in the background. At his age, that couldn‚Äôt mean anything good: he had probably found an electrical outlet and a fork to stick into it.

‚ÄúI should go,‚Äù my wife whispered, then hung up. Although I knew she had to take care of Carter, it didn‚Äôt feel like that was why she got off the phone. It seemed a lot more like she was trying to avoid my question.¬†

Sighing, I looked over my setup. A chair hidden behind the door. A cell phone ready to record, facing my son‚Äôs crib. A baseball bat, a pocket knife, and duct tape‚Äìyou never know, I figured. I had filled the disposable cup I‚Äôd gotten from the hotel to the brim with strong coffee, and I sipped it slowly while I watched the sun go down.¬†

The past three days had been exhausting, but I couldn‚Äôt use anything that might create light or sound to keep myself awake. I didn‚Äôt want to do anything that might change the pattern of the past several nights. *I must not fall asleep,* I repeated to myself. *No matter what, I must not fall asleep‚Ä¶*

When my eyes snapped open, my watch read 4:17 AM. Over two hours had passed since I‚Äôd last checked‚Äìit was possible that I had missed the whole thing! Without remembering the need for silence, I sprang to my feet and scanned the room. Nothing was out of place‚Ä¶

But there was a new, lightless hallway leading into the wall behind me. I turned, barely daring to breathe; I could feel the cool air pouring out of the impossible space, chilling the sweat on my skin. Gripping my baseball bat, I stepped forward into the darkness.

I had decided not to use any light source; I didn‚Äôt want to draw attention to myself, and I could feel my way along the corridor just fine. The rough paint was familiar beneath my fingertips; this could have been the same corridor that led to my bedroom‚Ä¶except that it hadn‚Äôt been there just a few hours ago.¬†

I knew that there was a room at the end of the hallway only because a light suddenly switched on behind its door. I pressed myself against the wall, waiting. There was movement inside. The door swung open. A dark figure stood backlit by a lamp; it ran a hand through its hair, shouted something, and hurried past me toward my son‚Äôs bedroom. I held my breath as it passed, but there was no need: it was too distracted to notice my presence in the dark.¬†

After the figure passed, I slipped into the well-lit room ahead. I needed to know where it had come from, what it was, and what it wanted with my son.¬†

The last thing I had expected was to find myself back in my own bedroom. The plaid bathrobe hanging from the bathroom door, the digital alarm clock, the stack of towels on the dresser. Everything was the same‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶Or was it?¬†

The view out the window was unchanged, but it was covered by curtains: they looked identical to the ones that were still boxed up in the garage because I had never gotten around to hanging them. My Raymond Chandler novel was on the nightstand, but the bookmark was all the way back in the first chapter. *What the hell was happening to me?!*

Something in the hallway was coming toward me, muttering. Even though I was armed, I didn‚Äôt want to risk a confrontation‚Äìnot until I had a better idea of what was going on. The closet was half open and I ducked inside, pressing into a wall of familiar-yet-unfamiliar clothes. Through the cracked-open closet door, I could finally get a full view of the thing that had been frightening my son.¬†

It was like looking into that mirror. Worse, in a way, because the thing in that bedroom wasn‚Äôt just my reflection: it was *me.* Its voice was still distorted, but now I could make out what it was saying.

‚ÄúCarter? Where are you, buddy? This isn‚Äôt funny‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

The thing that looked like me scratched its head and stroked its three-day growth of beard, tossing aside pillows, checking under the bed‚Ä¶

What would I do when it got to the closet?

It left my line of sight. I lifted the bat, my hands slick with sweat.¬†

Seconds later it reappeared, a glowing screen in its hand.

‚ÄúCarter? CARTER!‚Äù It yelled, jogging back out of the bedroom.¬†

It was doing exactly what I would have done: making one last sweep of the house, then calling the police. If I wanted to get out of whatever this was and back to my own reality, I realized, my time was running out.¬†

I took a deep breath and slipped back into the hallway. Somewhere in the darkness‚Äìmaybe on the first floor of this eerily similar house‚ÄìI could hear my own disembodied voice, shouting for my son. As I walked, those panicked cries became warped and distorted. Finally, they faded altogether.

I could see my son‚Äôs bedroom up ahead: his crib on the opposite wall, the purple gecko plushie and the shattered camera on the floor beside it. I was almost there‚Äì

But the corridor was longer than I remembered. It stretched out beneath my feet like some kind of nightmarish treadmill: the distance between me and the world I knew might be as short as a few feet, or longer than the distance between stars. There was no way to know.

From my left, the beam of a wildly-waving flashlight illuminated the ceiling.¬†

‚ÄúHey! Stop right there!‚Äù someone was shouting. *‚ÄúHEY!‚Äù*¬†

It was coming from the first floor, from the bottom of the stairs in the middle of the hallway. In the shaking flashlight glow, my own face stared furiously up at me. Instead of a baseball bat, this version of me was armed with a butcher knife.¬†

‚ÄúWhat did you do with my son, you bastard?!‚Äù It snarled, then lunged.¬†

I realized that something about its presence had readjusted the weird space I was trapped in: suddenly I was making progress again! Carter‚Äôs room was still dead ahead. I sprinted as hard as I could, and felt the air change when I crossed over. I didn‚Äôt turn around until I was beside my son‚Äôs empty crib, but even so, I knew what I would find behind me: a bare wall. Somewhere out there, beyond impossible distances of space and time, my pursuer was probably about to burst confusedly into its own version of Carter‚Äôs room. From his perspective, *I* was the *‚Äúbad man‚Äù* who had come creeping out of a *‚Äúdark room.‚Äù*¬†

In my bedroom at the end of the hallway, I could see my phone on its charging station. I hurried back to it, eager to tell Anabel what I had discovered‚Ä¶until I remembered that my phone should have been set up to record on a chair in Carter‚Äôs bedroom. Wherever or whatever this place was, it wasn‚Äôt the same place I had started from.¬†

There was movement downstairs. Keys jangling, turning in a lock. *Somebody was about to come through the front door!* I grabbed my bat and crept to the top of the stairs. A dark shape stood on the porch, backlit by the outdoor lamp. It put its keys away, sighed, then stepped inside and turned on the lights.¬†

‚ÄúAnabel?!‚Äù I gasped. After so much darkness, the brightness from the first floor was blinding. My wife glared up at me, her face a mix of concern and anger.

‚ÄúYou were supposed to pick me up at the airport four hours ago! Is everything alright? Where‚Äôs Carter?‚Äù¬†

My mouth opened and closed, but no sound came out. How could I explain that Carter was with another Anabel, in another world where we were strangers? Even if I could have found the right words, I already knew that she wouldn‚Äôt believe me.¬†

I wish I could say that this story had a happy ending. I wish I could say that when I returned to Carter‚Äôs room, I found a passage back to the world where I had left him instead of four bare white walls‚Äì

But that isn‚Äôt what happened. Instead, I‚Äôm going to be back in this room tonight: waiting, hoping to find a way back to my son. Hoping that I won‚Äôt wake up with my own enraged face staring down at me and a knife at my throat.

I‚Äôd like this story to serve as a warning. Maybe one day you‚Äôll be visiting a distant relative or a new friend, or maybe even unpacking boxes in a new home of your own. You‚Äôll turn around and notice a door, a door where you were sure there wasn‚Äôt one before.

You might see a familiar looking room on the other side. You might see a friend, a loved one, or even yourself. You might be tempted to take a walk down that dark corridor.¬†

I had something between a memory and a dream of being with my mother. It is fuzzy now even just an hour later but it was something like a vague sense of her being disappointed in me. Which was rooted in a feeling I had from my real life with her. Anyway, at one point I felt like I wasn't just dreaming but was aware of what was happening. My thinking and my being in bed but it felt so vivid that I was in her living room. I was sitting on the floor at a chest that was the coffee table. I was facing the couch but the furniture was oriented differently than it had been in her house. The living room furniture in the dining room. 

I had a feeling wash over me that this memory of being in my mother's house was just like it had taken place yesterday. Like no time had passed even though it had been years since she died. Then came pain. A deep emotional grief that was so sharp and potent. As I felt it I did not feel a victim to it, but felt an awareness that this feeling was something I must tolerate for the moment and try not to push away. I was aware this experiencing pain was for my benefit long term, and I needed to push through and lean into it. It only lasted a minute or so. I woke up right after that and putzed around on my phone to shake off the feeling. I had only been able to tolerate it a minute or so before waking up. Again, I felt in full control of being able to wake up. Then I started to cry really hard. For a good five minutes waves and waves of crying. Then it was gone. I feel lighter.
