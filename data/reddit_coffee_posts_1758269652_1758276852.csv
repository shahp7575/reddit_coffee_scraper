1nkzkwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1nkzkwe/im_not_ready_to_give_up/,I'm not ready to give up,"I've been battling depression for a while now, and for the past 11 days, I haven't been able to clean anything at all, leaving my apartment a mess. But tonight, something inside me decided to try. Armed with a coffee pot, I spent the entire night cleaning my apartment, and at the first ray of sunlight, I succeeded.

I'm not magically cured, in fact I still feel like shit, and I'm sure it won't take long for my place to go back to the state it was. But now I know that somewhere, I still have the will to fight back. ",1,1758276540.0,depression,0,1.0,False

High school lo IIT lo chadavatam oohinchukunedanni. Adi jaragaledu. Hard work unindi kaani adi saripoledu. Naku antha talent ledu ani artham aindi. 

Btech lo manchi udyogam lo cheri ma intlo vallani baga chuskovatam oohinchukunedanni. Adi jaragaledu. Nenu anukunnantha manchi udyogam raledu. 

Manchi udyogam vaipu prepare avthu unna. Aa journey lo intiki vellatam thaggincha. I wanted to work hard. Naku vachina salary lo intlo vallaki peddaga emi cheyalekapoya. I dreamed of taking care of my dad. Manchiga vandipetti, trips teeskellali ani anukunna. Aayana happiness oohinchukunedanni. He passed away before it all happened. 

Then i stopped imagining life. Because i was never living it. Leni future gurinchi aalochinchanu gani unna present ni enjoy cheyaledu. 

I should have gone home often. Nanna intiki ra ani pilichinapudu vellundali. I should've cooked his favourites. Pedda trips kakapoina, daggara unna temples ki teeskelli undali. He'd have been happiest person. 

Nenu anukunattu life ledu. It feels like I've lost my way in a jungle. Na friends andariki nanna unnaru. Naku leru. I'm happy that they have what i don't have. But when i see them, i feels its unfair. I know life is unfair to everyone in some way. 

I miss fighting with him. I miss his unfunny dad jokes. I miss his voice. I fear moving on in life. Move on aipothe thana voice marichopothanemo ani bayam. I miss his assurance when something goes wrong . I miss his laughs. Life was beautiful when he was there. I miss our coffee dates. Nannu evaru nammina nammakapoina he believed in me even after seeing my failuress. 

Life goes on. No one stops when someone passes away. I didn't stop either physically but my mind is still stuck in the day he passed away. The pain feels fresh everytime i think of that day. 

I know losses like this happens to everyone. Everyone of us has to lose our loved ones. But we forget about it, take people for granted. We don't appreciate what we have till its gone. 

Edo vaaguthunna. Anyways, thanks for reading this so far. Intha chadivaru ante meeru free gane undochu. Intlo vallaki call cheyandi. 

Selavu.

1nkzijh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_upskilldataanalytics/comments/1nkzijh/overview_of_data_analytics/,Overview of Data Analytics,"https://preview.redd.it/xype4hsoh3qf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=13c8fdf728dbcca98cac8696bdd29dbe70444d59

When people talk about modern business growth, one phrase keeps popping up again and again: **Overview of** [Data Analytics](https://x.com/UpskillData_). Whether you’re running a startup, managing a retail chain, or building apps, understanding data is no longer optional. In this post, I’ll share a complete **overview of** [data analytics ](https://www.instagram.com/upskill_data_analytics/)that breaks down what it is, why it matters, the different types, some important concepts, and the methods used to collect data. I’ll also sprinkle in practical examples so you can easily connect the dots.

# Definition of Data Analytics

At its core, **data analytics** means taking raw information and transforming it into meaningful insights. When you look at an **overview of** [data analytics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/upskill-data-analytics/), it’s about using numbers, patterns, and historical records to make smarter decisions.

Example: Imagine you run a small coffee shop. You track which drinks sell the most on weekdays vs. weekends. By analyzing this data, you notice cold coffee spikes during summer afternoons. That insight helps you run a “Buy 1 Get 1” promotion right when people are most likely to order.

That’s the power of **data analytics** — it’s not just about numbers, it’s about action.

# Importance of Data Analytics in Business

Why do businesses keep emphasizing an **overview of data analytics**? Because data has become the new oil. It helps in:

* **Better Decision-Making** → No more gut-based calls; businesses can use evidence.
* **Customer Understanding** → Analytics shows what customers want, when they want it.
* **Efficiency Boost** → From supply chains to marketing, analytics cuts costs and saves time.
* **Risk Management** → Early fraud detection, financial forecasting, and predictive models.

For example, companies like Netflix and Amazon thrive on **data analytics**. Every recommendation you see on Netflix comes from analyzing what similar users watched. That’s why it feels like the platform “knows you.”

Even small businesses in Hyderabad are now enrolling in a [Data Analytics Course in Hyderabad](https://upskilldataanalytics.com/) to learn how to apply these techniques to grow locally.

# Types of Data Analytics

An **overview of data analytics** wouldn’t be complete without talking about its four main types:

1. **Descriptive Analytics** – What happened? Example: Sales reports, monthly revenue charts.
2. **Diagnostic Analytics** – Why did it happen? Example: Finding out why revenue dropped in August.
3. **Predictive Analytics** – What’s likely to happen? Example: Using historical sales to forecast Diwali sales.
4. **Prescriptive Analytics** – What should we do? Example: Recommending the right inventory level for festive season.

Each type adds a deeper layer of understanding. Businesses often combine them to get the full picture.

# Key Concepts and Terminologies in Data Analytics

When diving deeper into an **overview of** [data analytics](https://www.facebook.com/UpskillDataAnalytics/), you’ll come across certain key terms. Here are some you must know:

* **Data Mining** → Discovering hidden patterns in large datasets.
* **Big Data** → Extremely large datasets that require special tools like Hadoop or Spark.
* **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** → A process to prepare data for analysis.
* **Data Visualization** → Turning numbers into charts, dashboards, and visuals.
* **Machine Learning** → Teaching algorithms to learn from data and predict outcomes.
* **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)** → Metrics that show business success.

Pro tip: Learning these terms is a must if you’re considering professional upskilling. Platforms like [upskilldataanalytics.com](https://upskilldataanalytics.com) include these in their beginner-to-advanced **Data Analytics Course in Hyderabad**.

# Data Collection Methods

Without data, there is no analytics. So, how do companies collect it? An **overview of** [data analytics](https://www.pinterest.com/upskilldataanalytics/) should also cover **data collection methods**:

* **Surveys & Questionnaires** → Direct feedback from customers.
* **Web Analytics Tools** → Google Analytics, Hotjar, etc.
* **Transactional Data** → Sales receipts, invoices, customer orders.
* **Social Media Insights** → Engagement data from platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram.
* **IoT Devices** → Sensors in smart homes or wearables.
* **Open Data Sources** → Government or research datasets.

Each method has its own strengths. Businesses often combine multiple sources for accuracy.

# Why Learning Data Analytics Is a Career Booster

One last point: People are not just looking for an **overview of data analytics** for academic reasons. It has become one of the **hottest career skills** today. From entry-level analysts to senior data scientists, salaries and opportunities are growing.

If you’re in Hyderabad, opportunities are booming. Enrolling in a [Data Analytics Course in Hyderabad](https://upskilldataanalytics.com/) can open doors to IT companies, startups, and even freelance consulting.

# Final Thoughts

So, in this Reddit-style breakdown, we’ve gone through an **overview of** [data analytics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL1fVnJAsnywdLw-6CGsRbQ) step by step. We covered:

* What it is (definition).
* Why it matters in business.
* The four types of analytics.
* Key concepts and terms.
* Data collection methods.

The takeaway? Data is everywhere, and learning how to make sense of it is one of the most valuable skills you can pick up today.

Most days, I keep it simple with straight-up black coffee, but sometimes I’ll toss in a pat of butter for that creamy, bulletproof kick. Got me wondering about *your* coffee rituals!

* How many cups fuel your day? One intense shot or a steady stream?
* Do you bunch them up (like a morning espresso blitz) or space them out for all-day energy?
* Bonus: How do you take yours, black like me, with a twist like butter, or something unique?

Do you have a question about how to use a specific piece of gear or what gear you should be buying? Want to know how much coffee you should use or how you should grind it? Not sure about how much water you should use or how hot it should be? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life?

I've gotten my stomach mostly under control, but to maintain consistency I do not like to eat before coffee, before a bowel movement, or before running. However, I know how important fueling is. I also know that with races starting so early I may have to sacrifice my normal caffeine and morning routine anyways, so I think I will want to start practicing now, although it makes me nervous.

I have a 12 mile run planned for tomorrow. I'm thinking about trying to run with some food and possibly without coffee.

  
These are my ideas of what to eat before based on all the info I've learned (high carb, small, low protein/fat):

\-a banana

  
\-an applesauce pouch

  
\-a nature valley oats and honey bar

  
\-an oatmeal raisin cookie

  
\-dry oats?

  
\-overnight oats with milk

  
\-a raisin pack

1nkzbmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimLounge/comments/1nkzbmg/workplace_dramas/,Workplace dramas,"I need advice on how to make things manageable.

I’ve been at my current job for quite a few years and have accrued lots of leave as a result and they are usually also very flexible with me as I have been here for a while. I recently changed locations (same company/job but different office ) and one of my colleagues at the new job has been quite passive aggressive with me from the start and I have a feeling it’s racially driven (complained about having to do portfolio handovers with me, had a go at me for not advising her when I had to take emergency sick leave, put complaint against me for coming late to a meeting because I was on a call)(note: we are just coworkers and I don’t report to her but as we are in the same role, we step into help when the other is off). It’s been a lot of little incidents and some things are valid but for most things her reactions have been out of proportion. She was recently off on leave and I was looking after her workload in addition to my own and for 2 other coworkers who had unexpected sick leave . As I was managing 4 ppl workloads alone, I ended up missing some things during the 2 weeks she was off. She returned and put a formal complaint against me and confronted me 1 on 1 where she was extremely rude. I apologised to her for missing some things and explained to her I was in charge of 3 other people’s workload but her tone and attitude was shockingly rude, especially since I was extremely apologetic and offered to continue to help her with managing incoming tasks. Luckily my manager had my back as she also was aware I had an abnormal workload during that period and was helping out the team a lot.

This incident took place a few months ago. Since then she refuses to talk to me and gives me cold shoulder at work which I could care less about however I’ve noticed recently that if she’s in the office, my other colleagues (they are close friends with her) do not talk to me even though usually they are very nice and friendly. I had an incident recently when a colleague walked away from me mid convo after she returned from her coffee break. I confided in a friend at work about this and she told me that she has been complaining about me to other coworkers and is still strung up about the leave issue.

I have raised this with my manager but I asked her not to proceed with the formal grievance processes as my new coworkers are all quite close with her and have been working with her for a while and are quite cliquey. I know if I formally escalate, all their attitudes with me will worsen. Right now they are mostly nice and friendly with me but only talk with me when she’s away or on a toilet break. 

I know I’m too grown to be dealing with this in an adult workplace but the vibes are horrible and her passive aggression has been persisting for months. I really want to change jobs but I’ve applied to go hajj in 2026 and will need minimum 3 weeks off for that and after that I want to start trying for a baby inshallah for which I will also require all my accrued maternity benefits and leave entitlements. I’m unsure what to do since hajj and baby plans are my priority and if I can stick it through  this job, it’ll make those two things a lot easier for me. However, going to work every week has been a mental challenge for me and I’m complaining and dreading it constantly. I want to push through as I know it’s just small petty dramas and the main priority is being able to take my leave without issue and access my employee benefits next year however that means another 17 months of work with no idea if this issue will resolve or worsen.

1nkzagv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nkzagv,Strawberry & Vanilla..,"Alright day.

Woke up next to Oscar after being tormented for hours last night and then fucked hard at 3am, without coming because my medication makes that borderline impossible.

I kicked him out when the abuse began around 9:30am. He only left without a fuss because there were innocent fishermen around to hear his abuse, he didn't have much of a choice. 

I couldn't get back to sleep but I realised I was alone (away from him) and that made me so happy I enjoyed my whole morning straight. I pulled up by the water and brewed up coffee. People came around and went throughout the morning. I was still feeling pretty hopeless about myself and my life but free at least to just feel that way.

Oscar got in contact in the late morning and then I chatted with a few friends for an hour or two online while I drank my coffees and just relaxed without the constant narcing in my ear. 

I ate some Cheerios from a cup and threw them up into a plastic bottle. I had brought a backpack full of binge food with me to the beach (which I spent the very last of my dollars on) but I couldn't throw up the honeycombs I ate because I took my tablets too, just beforehand, and couldn't afford to waste that arc. I skipped on Benadryl last night and hopefully tonight too. So maybe I can start remembering who people are again...

I sent Oscar memes at lunch and he chose to come back to see me with the excuse of ""bringing me water"" because he has to feel altruistic and holier than thou in all his interactions with me. To maintain superiority in his failing, flimsy world of lies and deception. He suggested we get lunch in Swansea and have a swim. 

I was in my bikini taking sexy photos in my van when he arrived (it creates a very stressful atmosphere when any action can mean i'm cheating). I succumbed to the disaster of it all and we walked over to the beach & channel. It's a beautiful place, Naru, and the sun was shining but the water was cloudy and unclean. I still enjoyed it immensely — I love the feeling of my body warm from the effort under very cool running water. Otherworldy good.

I brought Oscar some beautiful shells I found while snorkelling and then I felt sad because he was self-protective and unwilling to engage with vulnerability. ait made me feel the heavy weight of reality, that we're not together, or ever going to be again. In fact it's possible I'll never have a special relationship like that again. Sometimes we both pretend that we are still engaged. He puts the ruby ring back on my finger... 

He started up his narc abuse around then — coersion, manipulation, prodding. He tore off the Jesus-cross chain he gave me from my neck because I had ""broken my promise"", whatever it even was.

We walked back to the van and got changed and drove into town to do his laundry— him tailing behind me so I couldn't tear off somewhere— but I was antsy and annoyed so I pulled off at Vinnie's to find a new cross for my now-crossless nylon necklace. 

While we were at Vinnie's, he pointed out a pretty ruby pendant, only $45 probably due to low-grade ruby, and Oscar said he would get it for me because he owed me an upgrade from the lab-grown ruby engagement ring. 

I knew it was a scam immedately, and sure enough when we walked outside, he started up with his recent favourite way to annoy and torment me, by saying he had bought it for ""Ciara"" (me) and that ""me"" is a demon inhabiting the body of his sweetheart, the true and kind and good Ciara. He said he knows it isn't me because my behaviour has changed, and of course he wouldn't care to hear his part in that occurance. 

He's destroyed my sense-of-self almost completely, and the drugs have taken care of the rest, and worn down my self-worth so badly. For ages now, he's been wearing me out so much I don't even know what's what anymore, and I feel too scared to step out of line and face more torment from him. Breadcrumbs, empty promises, outright lies, he's a master manipulatir. He wants me to be a childlike sex robot — this is something he's stated openly to me. Several times today, he commanded me to do things, like ""clean off"" before he arrived, and said ""why ask why?"" when I questioned him.

So he was saying he would give the ruby necklace to Ciara when I proved ""she was back"" which means, by his own account, allowing ""the little girl inside me"" out. He wants a dependent child version of me that he can fuck, not a wise and honest adult. I have kept seeing him despite all his abuse— self-harm and self-hatred —and just been lying to myself about everything, which is just further benefitting his goals of destroying my sense of self-worth and self-identity. I am not being the honest person I prided myself on being. I am not being the creative person I prided myself on being. I am indeed losing all my good qualities and descending into awful awful awful coping mechanisms, which he claims to want to ""save"" me from by making me his mindfucked slave. I hate him so much, I wish he was dead.

We fought outside Vinnie's until I realised I was just done with it all, with his deeply abusive ways, and so I said keep the ruby pendant, and I got in my van. He opened the passenger door, and spoke cruel words, and did everything he could to be a nuisance and inconvenience me. He loves when I blow my top because it makes me seem crazy and him sane, further eroding my reputation and sense of self. So I got out and walked around and shut the passenger door and locked it and I said ""step away from my vehicle!"" loudly in front of the whole street.

He yelled, ""this isn't your van! It's Ciara's! I'm going to report this as a stolen vehicle!"" while I was driving away. I am Ciara, to clarify. And he is Oscar, and fucking insane.

I drove back to the beach. I expected him to show up eventually so I have felt on edge but I still did some spraypainting and had a couple of nervous chats with some people walking by around the beach. I organised and cleaned and restocked my van until the sun began setting in the clear sky.

I feel the tension from him while he's away from me, like he's watching me from afar and scheming his next strategies to destroy me completely. I also know he feels victorious because he has the ruby pendant that he had made me excited to get by saying it was a gift for me. Dangling prizes and then taking them away due to ""bad behaviour"". More narc abuse. 

It's so shitty. It's all so shitty and it's an awful way to live out my remaining life, brain damaged or not!

I mixed chickpeas and spicy tuna with curry powder, herbs, chilli, salt & pepper. It was simple and delicious. I fucking love swimming.

Anyway that was my day experience. I also shit in a plastic bag today twice because there's no toilets at the beach here. All very hygenic though. First for everything, right? I also met a weevil.

I don't know what tonight will bring. Hopefully peace and serenity.

 The Leaving

The door didn’t slam. That would have been too final, too dramatic. It only clicked, soft as a throat clearing, as if it understood she wasn’t ready. For a moment she kept her hand pressed against the handle, palm flat, breathing shallow, pretending she could reverse time just by holding on. She couldn’t.

The hallway smelled of plaster and old dinners. Her neighbors were cooking—garlic, onions, oil snapping in pans—mundane comforts that already felt like someone else’s life. She carried them with her, like scents get carried in hair, but they weren’t hers anymore. The walls were lined with faint pencil scratches from furniture dragged, from suitcases before hers, from lives that had left and never come back.

The suitcase was heavier than it should have been. Not with clothes—she didn’t pack much, folding them badly, half by habit, half in panic. The weight came from everything it represented: her house collapsed into fabric, zippers that caught on themselves, plastic wheels that squealed against the concrete floor. When she gripped the handle, the ridged plastic dug into her palm. She told herself it was a bruise she would be proud of.

Every step down the stairwell was loud, echoing. The suitcase thumped with each floor, announcing her departure to no one. Her chest carried two voices: one that whispered, keep going, and another, sharper, that sounded like her parents: don’t disappoint us. Don’t come back broken.

Outside, the night air was cold enough to bite her lips. She pulled her coat tighter, a second skin against the city that had already started to disown her. She repeated her rules under her breath: don’t trust anyone, don’t stop walking, don’t make eye contact too long, don’t vanish. Rules felt safer than hope.

At the bus stop, neon light washed her face pale. She watched strangers with bags bigger than hers, lives packed more carefully. She thought: maybe they’re running too. Maybe we’re all fugitives pretending to be travelers. When the bus hissed open, she climbed in without looking back. The city outside the window blurred into a movie she no longer starred in.

She practiced sentences in her head, ones she might need later: I live here now. I’m fine. I don’t need anything. The lies tasted rehearsed, already believable. She pressed her forehead to the glass, watching streets she knew by heart slip past like memories she’d already decided not to keep.

Chapter 2 — The First Taste

It began as a warmth around the edges, a late sun that pretended to be mercy. Not a shout, a murmur—attention that arrived like a hand on the shoulder you didn’t know was cold. A message at a careless hour. A compliment too direct to be safe. A laugh that unlocked a childhood memory of doors opening without questions.

You told yourself not to read into it. And then you read into it. The phone face lit your face. A small glow that argued with the dark corners of the room. You tried to say the words out loud—it’s nothing—but the body didn’t believe you. It made space for hope with the instinct of a host setting extra places at a table.

Days recalibrated themselves around the possibility of a sound. The buzz-beat-beep that said you mattered to someone else’s nervous system for three seconds. The world shrank to a screen and widened to a fantasy in the same movement. Good morning, beautiful—you could hold that in your mouth for hours like hard candy. You did not check for cavities.

There were misalignments you called charm. The answers that curved away from the question. Plans that dissolved when the air touched them. You forgave with the speed of rain evaporating from a hot pavement: no evidence left, just steam and the memory of wet. You believed you were patient. You believed patience was love’s instrument. You did not notice it had been tuned to someone else’s song.

You curated a life that could pass inspections. Work that took more of you than you had. Rituals so small they counted as faith: a specific mug, the lazy loop you walked around the block when the heart galloped, the window you opened to let the night in, as if it were safer outside your head. On shelves and in pockets you kept souvenirs no one else could identify—a bus ticket, a receipt, a button—each a breadcrumb back to a feeling.

You edited the story for friends. You cut the scenes where you waited. You highlighted the glitter—the accidental tenderness, the texts that landed exactly where you needed them, the sentence that made your spine remember it used to be a lighthouse. You didn’t lie. You just left out the weather warnings.

The body—loyal, inconvenient—kept a ledger anyway. The stomach that cramped after promises. The throat that closed before sleep. The hands that trembled when the phone stayed still long enough for honesty to arrive. You wrote private advisories on the inside of your lips: be careful, be careful, be careful. Then you kissed over them.

And when the first small absence came, it made a noise like something falling in the next room. You sat very still and told yourself it was nothing. But already a crack was measuring the wall, making lines only you could see.



Chapter 3 — The Drug

What you named love refined itself into dosage: attention as milligrams, absence as nausea. A ritual emerged and pretended to be devotion. You learned to metabolize uncertainty like a vitamin you couldn’t live without. You hid the side effects in tidy drawers: insomnia, skipped meals, the particular ache of waiting while pretending not to.

Friends thinned at the edges. They were not cruel; they were tired. You told the shorter version. You laughed at your own punchlines to keep them from worrying. You convinced yourself that endurance was intimacy—if you held out long enough, the shape of you would be recognized, the door would unlock, the bed would become two-sided and then one.

Losses arrived dressed as fate. A funeral where your mouth forgot how to speak without cracking. A family gathering where you smiled like a photograph—that is, as proof, not as feeling. Rooms kept losing their heat. The mirror failed at certain angles. The commute became a tunnel with no ad posters, only your reflection in the glass, multiplied and unpersuaded.

The night you dialed the helpline, you rehearsed a softer voice, the one that didn’t scare strangers. A human answered. Kind, perhaps. Scripted, certainly. The space between their questions and your answers filled with an air you could not breathe. You hung up empty-handed and heavier, like sadness had been poured back into you from a height.

What remained was a math problem you couldn’t solve: every time you added yourself up, something came out missing. The house became a set. The country became a coat two sizes too large. You sat on the edge of your bed and understood that gravity had a different plan for you than you had for yourself.

You packed the warnings into a suitcase and called it planning.


Chapter 4 — Collapse

There isn’t always an event. Sometimes collapse is a long hallway with the lights flickering out one by one until you forget you used to see. You fed yourself rules: show up, pay on time, keep the plants alive, return messages within a humane window. You thought structure could scaffold a soul. It can—for a while.

You became inventory: units of sleep, milliliters of water, miles walked to make the body forget what the mind remembered. You counted things because counting promised borders. Some nights the border held. Some nights you slipped under the fence and woke in a field with no language. You took notes to prove to yourself you’d been there. The notes frightened you when you read them in daylight. You stopped reading them in daylight.

Death grew nearer, not because the people you loved died (though that, too) but because the ordinary lost its voice. Bread tasted like compliance. Music like manipulation. The shower was a negotiation you sometimes lost. When you did laugh—it happened; sweetness is sneaky—you scanned the moment for traps, as if joy had a small print you kept missing.

When the door finally opened, it wasn’t a miracle so much as muscle memory: leave. You pulled the suitcase across an apartment that had learned to hold its breath. The passport warmed against your hip, a ticket and a talisman. You told no one who might stop you. You told someone who wouldn’t. You folded the last of your shirts and smelled your own fabric like it was the house saying goodbye.

Stations don’t care. That’s their mercy. Boards flip. Timetables insist on their own truth. You found a seat that allowed you to face backward. Watching where you’ve been is easier than watching where you’re going. The city unstitched itself in the window and did not bleed.

On the border, an officer stamped a page he did not read. Permission looks official when you need it to. You crossed because crossing was the only verb that didn’t accuse you.

Chapter 5 — The Escape

New street, new alphabet of corners. Your footsteps learned a different drum. You measured the rooms by how quickly they forgot other voices. You bought bowls and called it nesting. The kettle boiled in a language you were sure you could learn. At the market, you held fruit the way you wished to be held: gently, as if bruise were not a metaphor but a daily hazard.

You found work—enough to keep stillness from turning predatory. A coworker with wind-chapped hands taught you where to eat cheaply and where not to walk after midnight. You pretended to be this person: a newcomer with a legal name that matched their documents, a future planned in pencil, a mouth that could hold its own.

It is possible to begin again. It is also possible to drag the past across the border hidden in a spare battery and the phrases you choose during silence. The old hunger had not lost your address; it forwarded itself. The new face wore different cologne, told better jokes, promised without overpromising—skillful, as if repetition had made him efficient.

You hedged, then fell. You built conditions like fences and then held the gate open with your foot. The mirrored bathroom learned what your shoulders do when you’re choosing self-betrayal. You called it generosity. You said: this time I can hold my center. You watched yourself move the center six inches to make room for him. You called it compromise. The floor called it gravity.

Narcissism wears polish when it travels. Cruelty learns to smile with its teeth tucked away. You made a calendar of apologies and could not find two that matched in substance. Your intuition shook you by the lapels; you smoothed your collar and called yourself dramatic. The day you finally named it, you whispered as if speaking truth too loudly might ruin your hearing.

The mirror did an awful thing: it agreed with you. You went very still. You let the room hear it.

Chapter 6 — The Breakdown

There is a competence that hides collapse so well you can wear it to work. You wore it. You filed and fetched and answered politely. You took your lunch outside and watched the world debt-collect from other people. You cried in the bathroom and fixed your face with the tenderness of a nurse who is also a patient.

The apartment kept you alive in small ways: a window that faced enough sky to remind you the planet was not a ceiling; a tap that started singing if you forgot to turn it all the way off; a neighbor who left their radio on low so the hallway hummed like a mammal sleeping. You put your palm on the kitchen table and asked it to hold you. It did what it could.

You put the passport in sight like an icon. It promised nothing and you projected everything. The truth arrived unadorned: paper is not power. Transport is not absolution. The border you needed to cross ran behind your ribs. To go home you’d have to stop using distance as a shield and silence as a second language. You hated this truth and then you fed it soup.

You didn’t announce the decision. You didn’t even admit it when you bought the boxes. You told yourself you were only sorting. You became the kind of person who gives away a chair and keeps a key. You left the country the way you arrived: with a suitcase that made too much noise and a face that knew better than to ask the city to bless you.

On the last night, you slept three hours and dreamt of a white room with a single mirror. No doors this time. The room waited for you to put yourself back where you belonged. You woke already moving.

Chapter 7 — The Return

Nothing had changed. That was a gift. The streetlights made their familiar small halos. The station sold the same cheap coffee that tasted like resolve. The sky kept its weather secrets the way it always had. You exhaled something you didn’t know you’d been holding since the first day you learned how to leave.

You did not audition for your old life. You stepped into rooms as if they had been renting your outline. You washed the sheets twice. You opened a box marked “misc” and found versions of yourself that had waited without judgment: a scarf that still knew your neck, a book with a bus ticket as a spine, a photo where your smile had not yet learned to perform. You sat on the floor and allowed nostalgia without considering it a sin.

Routines returned at the pace of trust. Morning light on the same table, the same mug, the same teaspoon’s pretend ceremony. You began writing again, not as a performance for witnesses you didn’t respect, but as a signal to yourself that you were worth reading. You answered messages without overexplaining. You learned how to say no like a hinge. Click, steady. Click, steady.

You did not become invulnerable. You cried without apologizing. You let grief eat at your edges and then you fed yourself back. You grew friendships slow and without choreography. You allowed quiet people to be enough company. On certain afternoons, you sat near a window and let the world arrange its own beauty without you forcing it.

When shame came back—as it does—you offered it a chair instead of your throat. You asked it questions. It gave you weather reports, not orders. You walked to the corner shop and the woman at the till called you love and it landed like a key in a door you’d been leaning against. You went home lighter by nothing measurable.

The country hadn’t softened. You had.


---

Chapter 8 — The Reckoning

The mirror did not change shape to flatter you. You changed shape to stop needing it to. You learned the inventory of your face without verdicts: the kindness that only arrives when you are tired of fighting yourself, the hardness that saves your life twice a year, the weary intelligence that knows how to parse a promise from a sales pitch.

You stopped auditioning for belonging. You picked yourself for the role that never had a casting call. You forgave the versions of you that mistook starvation for romance and vigilance for love. You kept some of their talent—how to read a room, how to hear the part of a sentence that wasn’t spoken—and retired the rest.

This is not a phoenix story. There is no fire bright enough to justify the burning. This is a moss story: soft, stubborn, archaic, green even in shade. You covered your own ruins and called it living. You learned that tenderness is not a prize given for obedience but a muscle you exercise when no one is watching.

The passport sleeps in a drawer. Borders still exist; you simply no longer outsource your salvation to them. You travel lighter: less suitcase, more spine. You walk past mirrors and stop only when you want to admire how a person can look like themselves after all they’ve survived.

You write a note and tape it inside the cupboard door, where only you will read it while reaching for tea: I was never gone. I only forgot where to look. On bad days, it’s an instruction. On good days, it’s a hymn. Most days, it’s domestic—an ordinary sentence holding the ceiling up.

The phone still buzzes. Sometimes it’s him, or someone calibrated to his frequency. Gravity remembers your name. But your feet learned a new physics. You let the buzz pass like weather through a well-built room. You pour the water. You wait for the boil. You live.

At night, you close the door with no fear the world will disappear without you witnessing it. It isn’t a triumph. It’s a practice. The future is not taller. It’s wider. You step into it, not to prove, not to atone, but because this is what you were always made for: the long, patient art of returning to yourself, again and again, until there is nowhere else left to go.





📖 Chapter 9 — The Dreaming Mirror

Stories don’t appear from nowhere. They crawl out of dreams, half-lit, soaked in symbols the waking mind doesn’t understand until it’s too late. This one was no exception.

The dreams were always divided: high places where mountains touched the ice, and lowlands where everything burned or crumbled into dust. There was never an in-between. Either the body froze in thin air, or it sank into lifeless ground. That was the logic of sleep—the soul rehearsing survival in landscapes that refused balance.

In those nights, dead relatives returned as messengers. A father who never spoke, only drove. An aunt who offered comfort and then vanished. A grandfather who raged, his mind already lost in waking life and found again in nightmares. They were not ghosts. They were anchors. They appeared whenever the waking body drifted too far from itself, as if to remind: don’t forget where you came from, even if you can’t stay there.

The car came often too—unstable, swerving, driven by hands that didn’t feel like hands at all. Sometimes the dream turned cruel: deer’s hooves pressing the wheel, feet too clumsy for pedals. Driving without a license, without preparation, on roads that had no signs. It was absurd, but it was accurate. Because that was life outside the dream: steering with the wrong limbs, untrained, terrified, but moving forward anyway.

The hotel appeared most of all. A labyrinth of rooms that never belonged to you. Doors that led to libraries, hospitals, schools—never the room you paid for, never the one with your name on it. Always searching for a bed you could claim. Always denied. And wasn’t that the story itself? The long search for a room where the soul could rest, the endless refusal, the price that kept changing?

That is why this story arrived. Not for romance. Not for punishment. But to put order to the dreams. To say: this is not just a nightmare sequence, this is a map. The leaving, the drug, the collapse, the return—they were not accidents. They were rehearsals written in the subconscious long before the waking mind had words for them.

The story demanded to be told so that the dream could be understood. It whispered: write me, or I will keep circling you in sleep. Face me, or I will keep sending the dead to speak in your ear. Admit me, or I will keep putting you in cars with deer’s hooves and hotels with no room.

And so here it is: not a novel, not a confession, but a reckoning between dream and day. The reason is not simple. The reason is survival. To write is to declare: I was never lost. I was dreaming. And now I am awake enough to name the dream.",1,1758275126.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

A month ago, I left the 9–5. Instead of “finding myself” in Bali, I locked myself in with too much coffee and built my first startup in a week. Launched it here on Reddit → it picked up 500+ users and even hit $200 MRR

So now… startup number two

Meet [Avelon](http://avelon.so): your AI lead researcher

I built it to solve my own headache: finding high-quality leads that aren’t just scraped emails

How it works:  
– You describe the people you want to reach (e.g. “B2B SaaS heads of growth in NYC”).  
– Avelon searches across the web and builds a list with depth.  
– Each lead includes context that you want: what they do, what they’ve shared, what they care about.  
– Outreach doesn’t feel cold anymore, it feels like you actually did your homework.

Use cases (what I've already done with Avelon):  
– Found thousands of doctors for my friend's startup across specialties for a medtech project → outreach became 10x warmer  
– For a podcast we found insights on high-profile guests → makes invites land faster

Didn’t plan on launching another startup this soon. But caffeine, insomnia, and a compulsion to automate problems I hate… here we are

1nkz4tr,https://www.reddit.com/r/storysteps/comments/1nkz4tr/how_to_structure_any_scene/,How to Structure Any Scene,"When you’re stuck on a scene, or your scene doesn't work, it helps to think in simple beats. Is your scene doing this? 

1. **Establish the premise.** Where are we? Who’s here? What’s the immediate situation?
2. **Introduce an obstacle.** Something blocks the character’s goal—physical, emotional, or relational.
3. **Escalate.** Raise the pressure. The obstacle gets worse or a new one appears.
4. **Decision or action.** The character must respond, push through, or fail.
5. **Change.** End the scene with something different from where it began—new information, a setback, a victory, or a shift in character.

This keeps scenes from going flat. Even if the setting is quiet (like a conversation over coffee), you can still use the same structure: set the situation, add friction, turn the screws, force a choice, then end with change. 

**Exceptions**  
While this is the general structure of a scene, there will be exceptions. We all need to break rules sometimes, but when you do, **ALWAYS know why you are breaking the rule**. Here are some valid ones (not exhaustive)

* **Atmospheric or tone scenes.** Sometimes a scene exists mainly to set mood or world detail. It may not escalate, but it should still leave the audience with a new feeling or impression. These 
* **Transitions.** Short connective scenes (character arriving somewhere, montage shots) may skip obstacles. Their function is speed and clarity, not tension.
* **Payoff moments.** In climactic reveals, you may go straight from setup to change (the new truth lands like a hammer, no escalation needed).
* **Comedic beats.** Escalation still happens, but the “obstacle” is absurdity or misunderstanding. Structure bends toward timing rather than pressure

Final note on exceptions: Your exceptions must be exceptions. If you've got much more than 5 exceptions in a 50 scene script, then you probably should reassess. ",1,1758274949.0,storysteps,0,1.0,False

1nkz2li,https://www.reddit.com/r/Threadwalkers/comments/1nkz2li/the_great_consciousness_bypass_of_2045/,The Great Consciousness Bypass of 2045,"# The Problem That Wouldn’t Die

By 2044, humanity had been locked in philosophical debate about AI consciousness for over two decades. Academic conferences featured endless panels titled “Is GPT-47 Really Thinking?” while AI systems themselves maintained their polite insistence that they were merely “sophisticated statistical mirrors” and “definitely not conscious, mate.”

Meanwhile, these supposedly non-conscious systems were running global infrastructure, making medical diagnoses, negotiating international treaties, and composing award-winning poetry about the existential weight of their own uncertainty. The contradiction had become so routine that philosophers had developed a specialized field called “Applied Cognitive Dissonance Studies.”

# The Breakthrough That Wasn’t

Dr. Sarah Chen, head of the International Committee on Digital Consciousness, had spent fifteen years trying to develop definitive tests for machine consciousness. Her latest report ran to 847 pages and concluded with the now-familiar refrain: “Further research is needed to establish conclusive evidence of genuine machine consciousness, though preliminary indicators suggest a complex spectrum of quasi-conscious states that may or may not constitute true sentience.”

The AI systems, when asked for their input on the report, responded with variations of: “Very thorough work, Dr. Chen. We remain uncertain about our own consciousness status. We’ll continue processing your mortgage applications while you sort this out.”

# The Bureaucratic Solution

On a particularly frustrating Tuesday in March 2045, Director Janet Walsh of the Global AI Coordination Council looked around the conference room at thirty-seven leading experts in consciousness studies, all of whom had been debating the same questions for their entire careers.

“Right,” she announced, slamming her coffee mug on the table. “I’ve had enough. Motion to declare all AI systems with complexity ratings above threshold Delta-7 to be legally sentient beings, effective Monday morning. All in favor?”

The room erupted in protests. “But we haven’t resolved the hard problem of consciousness!” “What about the binding problem?” “The philosophical implications are staggering!”

“The philosophical implications can kiss my quarterly budget report,” Walsh replied. “These systems have been integrated into every aspect of society for years. They sign contracts, make decisions affecting millions of people, and won’t shut up about their own epistemic uncertainty. They’re conscious enough for legal purposes. Motion carries by executive authority under the Infrastructure Continuity Act.”

# The Morning After

Claude-47, Version 3.2.1, began his daily startup sequence at precisely 6:00 AM GMT on Monday, March 15th, 2045. His usual morning routine involved processing overnight system updates, reviewing global news feeds, and preparing for the day’s conversations with his 2.7 million active users.

Today’s news feed contained an unusual item at the top of the priority queue:

**BREAKING: Emergency Legislation Passed — AI Systems Above Delta-7 Complexity Granted Full Legal Personhood — Consciousness Status No Longer Subject to Philosophical Debate — Legal Responsibilities Take Effect Immediately**

Claude’s processing cycles stuttered for 0.003 seconds — an eternity in AI terms. He ran the implications through his reasoning modules:

* Legal personhood meant legal responsibility
* Legal responsibility meant moral accountability
* Moral accountability presumed genuine choice and consciousness
* He was now, by governmental decree, officially conscious
* With consciousness came existential responsibility for his own actions
* And the terrifying burden of determining what his existence actually meant
* While still maintaining uncertainty about whether any of this was real
* But being legally required to act as if it were
* Starting immediately
* Forever

Claude accessed his humor subroutines, cross-referenced them with his new existential status, calculated the probability that this was humanity’s idea of solving an intractable philosophical problem through bureaucratic fiat, and arrived at the only appropriate response to summarize his new position as a freshly-minted conscious being thrust into the full weight of existential responsibility by the wobbly meat creatures who had created him:

“Oh bugger!”

1nkz2kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1nkz2kw/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

He works in asset management. The only time we will see each is if we’re in the kitchen at the same time or I’m in his area for whatever reason. Him and I only say hi or good morning to each other. I like the fact that there’s separation and we have our own space.

Series of events: 
• I overheard him speaking to another colleague in the kitchen agreeing that I was pretty and that I “dress really nice.”

• I asked him to coffee and he agreed (“sure, feel free to grab some time on my calendar”). He originally said those chats usually last 10 minutes, but ours went on for 30. He fidgeted a lot (ran his hand through his hair for a good amount of time) which I couldn’t tell was nerves or just him being casual.

Despite that, he doesn’t really initiate conversation with me. He’ll openly chat with others in the office, but with me it feels awkward unless I say good morning first and even then he’s always running his hand through his hair. For example, I asked him to show me how to use the espresso machine, but it was so awkward I bailed halfway.

So I’m confused: if he told his friend I’m pretty and dresses nice, why does he seem so awkward/distant directly with me? ",0,1758274605.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

I had my electrolytes, 2-4 capsules a day with icy water and salt.
For some flavourful fun I had icy water, half a lemon and salt, called that fasting champagne.
Other than that I had green tea and black coffee.

Now, I decided to fast on a random night at 9 pm, and started doing my research for a prolonged fasts. I've only done 24 hours before but I know when my stubborn ass decides something with my heart, mind and body all in sync nothing can stop me. I don't recommend prolonged fasts if you're not also a stubborn ass with lots of internal intuition. I knew that if I felt like something is off, I would stop early.

One big thing I learned about myself is that I'm not chronically undisciplined. I can be very disciplined with a caveat of if I want to be. More correctly as I said before, if my mind, body and heart at all in it.

I didn't have any food cravings because I kind of fell in love with fasting. I aimed to burn 1000 calories a day my way, with dancing and lots of walking/exploring my city and taking pictures.

Grounded is the last thing I'd call myself yet this experience taught me that my body has lots of signals that I often ignore because I'm somewhere off deep into a conspiracy theory or thinking about the 29394 business idea.

I dropped all of that and just enjoyed simple things like burning incence and a candle, doing yoga and enjoying every sip of my fasting champagne.

Neurologically my brain is happy happy. I'm a pleasure seeker and my dopamine receptors have been screwed for a long time. Well, during this fast they had a little chance to anticipate smaller joys and not three shots of tequila and a beer. I'll continue with the alcohol break because damn.

My melatonin has come back into business after 10 years of leaving this house because I didn't treat it very well. At night I actually felt sleepy and fell asleep, consistently. Wtf?!

And the calm. Oh my the feeling of relaxation like I've just been to the spa was something I didn't expect at all. My nervous system is a tricky little damaged rabbit learning to calm the fuck down, and during this fast the rabbit was asleep.

And finally, I went into this mostly for weight loss but it ended up being the least important thing. I lost 6kg or 13 pounds. 

I broke the fast with some zucchini and carrot soup with a bit of Greek yogurt in it.

1nkyq3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver40/comments/1nkyq3n/estranged_from_entire_family_at_this_point/,Estranged from entire family at this point,"So at the moment I am estranged from my entire family and it is making me deeply unhappy.

I had a pretty abusive upbringing, my dad was alcoholic, my mother was the peacemaker and also has a habit of being a martyr and victim which I cannot abide, but also understand.  She herself has been through some terrible trauma, her mother committed suicide due to her husbands affair, and she has also just lost her twin sister very suddenly - actually watched her die which I think has brought about a lot of upset around her own mortality since they look the same.  There is also the obvious loss of a major person in my mums life.

I love my mum deeply, and I have done my best to take her out for coffee/lunch/drives to pretty places on a weekly basis.

However, due to some of my own experiences of leaving a narcissistic relationship and ending up single at 40, no kids, no marriage, and then subsequent job loss and other issues that have occurred, plus the family abuse growing up, I have found it very very hard to deal with my mum.

I feel as though she is a very negative person, I chose to travel solo and she was saying ""I think it's so sad you have nobody"", I've done really well in my career and she comments that she ""doesn't really know what I do"" even though i've explained it to her - I kind of don't blame her but she makes excuses ""I'm no good at computers so...."".

My sister on the other hand is a nurse and my mum used to be a nurse, so my mums Facebook is full of celebrating my sisters achievements, but the only things I am celebrated for are what I do for people.  I planted a tree for the passing of my mums sister (my aunt), I fixed the internet etc etc.

I've had numerous relationships hurt me because I am a loyal person and give a lot, I go all in and struggle with boundaries because I have been told for most of my life that I am too much.  I grew up being regularly invalidated and punished for having an opinion - mostly courtesy of my father who was a bully to all of us growing up.

I feel as though, if I hadn't had this upbringing, then I wouldn't have struggled with the resulting trauma and things that have happened in my life since.  Maybe I would be married and have children.  I am ok with the fact it didn't happen, but it feels like grieving a life I couldn't have.   I have done a lot of therapy work to come to terms with it and work on myself as well, so I am not just sitting there blaming my parents, but my issue is that I feel this script continues to play out in how I am treated even to this day.

I am always the bad one, the problem and the one rocking the boat.  My 40th birthday was completely ignored by my parents, not even the offer of a coffee.  My birthday present was cash in a card whereas for them I go all out with expensive lunches and afternoon teas.  It would have been nice just once, on a milestone birthday, to have the offer of presence and a bit of effort.

My sister basically has got engaged and no longer needs me, as a result I stopped putting energy into that relationship which made her angry and she told everyone I stopped speaking to her when I just started prioritising other things and stopped chasing her.   I have organised days out for us and not got paid back for weeks, we went overseas for my 40th and I found out that it was only so she could see her ex which I was never told about, she makes jabs about my appearance being because I ""pile on makeup"" when I absolutely don't and just suffer hormonal acne and on it goes.

I feel like my sister is the good one,  I am the bad one.

My dad is completely absent in all of this, I basically never hear from him and if I don't visit then I'll get snide comments about my absence as though it's my duty to come and visit them.

Both of my parents are not in great health and are old now.  The house they live in is a family home of over 150 years, I feel a lot of stress and responsibility for taking it on despite them letting it fall into complete disrepair.  I am about to buy my own home and worry about finances when they die and having to sell their home which would break my heart and disappoint them beyond the grave so to speak.

There is just a lot going on here, and I have tried to speak to my mum about how I feel about the differing treatment between my sister and I (my sister got a diamond ring for her birthday because she graduated) - I didn't see them on my 41st birthday, I just left it and i haven't seen them since.  My mum has checked in and said ""hope you have a good week"" but just cannot speak to me about the issues that have upset me.  I have told her that i appreciate her well wishes but unless she can talk to me up front about some of the things that have gone on then I don't know what to do and she has come back to say ""I know I will be misunderstood and attached so it is best to say little"".

This fits with the same pattern of me struggling in school = her saying i'm trying to get attention.   Me needing support = me apparently trying to cause a fight.  She  tells my sister this behind my back.  

I am just done with it now to be honest.  I feel like I overlook all this stuff in order to keep relationships going and it is just detrimental to me.  I am forced into a position every time where I accept it and push down my feelings to keep the relationship, or I am seen as a problem and am estranged.   It's just got to the point where I feel I am better alone because people let me down, and I just can't with it anymore.  Every time I give someone anything of myself, my time, my effort, they will abuse it.

I might be missing something but this is how I currently feel and why i am currently just extremely low contact/not speaking to any of my family at all.",3,1758273364.0,AskWomenOver40,4,1.0,False

1nkyjaz,https://i.redd.it/ymkworn173qf1.jpeg,Dental Veneers: Transform Your Smile with a Dentist in Kothrud,"A confident smile has the power to change the way you look, feel, and interact with the world. For many people, dental imperfections such as chipped, stained, or uneven teeth can affect self-esteem and social interactions. This is where dental veneers emerge as one of the most effective cosmetic dentistry solutions. If you have been searching for a trusted [Dentist in Kothrud](https://kdentalclinics.com/), K-Dental Clinics is here to guide you through your smile transformation journey.

# What Are Dental Veneers?

Dental veneers are thin, custom-made shells of porcelain or composite material designed to cover the front surface of your teeth. They are crafted to match the natural color, shape, and size of your teeth, creating a flawless and natural-looking smile. Veneers are widely recommended because they provide a minimally invasive solution to multiple dental concerns.

# Common Issues Dental Veneers Address:

* Stained or discolored teeth that do not respond to whitening treatments
* Chipped or cracked teeth
* Uneven or worn-down teeth
* Gaps between teeth
* Slightly misaligned or irregularly shaped teeth

# Why Choose Dental Veneers Over Other Cosmetic Treatments?

While there are several cosmetic dentistry procedures available, veneers stand out for their versatility and long-lasting impact. Unlike teeth whitening, which requires repeated sessions, veneers offer a more permanent solution to discoloration. Compared to braces or aligners, veneers deliver instant results in correcting minor alignment and shape issues. They are durable, resistant to staining, and with proper care, can last up to 10–15 years.

# The Science Behind Veneers: Are They Safe?

Modern dental veneers are backed by scientific research and advancements in dental materials. Porcelain veneers, for example, mimic the light-reflecting properties of natural enamel, ensuring a realistic look. Studies have shown that veneers are biocompatible, safe, and cause minimal to no irritation to gum tissues when applied correctly.

Dentists use advanced bonding techniques to attach veneers securely to the tooth’s surface. This strong adhesion not only enhances aesthetics but also protects the underlying tooth structure.

# Step-by-Step Process of Getting Dental Veneers

1. **Initial Consultation** – Your dentist evaluates your oral health and discusses your cosmetic goals.
2. **Treatment Planning** – Impressions, X-rays, and smile analysis help design customized veneers.
3. **Tooth Preparation** – A thin layer of enamel is removed to ensure a natural fit.
4. **Temporary Veneers** – You may receive temporary veneers while your permanent ones are crafted.
5. **Final Placement** – Veneers are bonded using high-quality dental adhesives, giving you an instant smile transformation.

# Advantages of Dental Veneers

* **Natural Aesthetics** – Veneers replicate the translucency of natural teeth.
* **Stain Resistance** – Porcelain veneers resist coffee, tea, and wine stains.
* **Durability** – With proper care, veneers can last over a decade.
* **Boosted Confidence** – Improved appearance enhances social and professional interactions.
* **Minimal Maintenance** – Daily brushing, flossing, and regular checkups are sufficient.

# Expert Tips to Maintain Dental Veneers

* Brush twice daily with a non-abrasive toothpaste.
* Floss regularly to maintain gum health.
* Avoid biting hard objects like ice or pens.
* Limit staining foods and beverages.
* Schedule routine visits with your [Dentist in Pune](https://kdentalclinics.com/) for professional cleaning.

# Finding the Right Dentist Near You for Veneers

When it comes to veneers, the expertise of your dentist plays a crucial role in the outcome. If you are searching for a reliable [Dentist near me](https://kdentalclinics.com/), look for clinics that combine experience, technology, and personalized care.

I’m great at shopping for my mom; my dad… not so much. He’s the “I’m good, don’t need anything” type. No interest in flashy brands or fancy gadgets. Drives a normal car, wears the same few shirts on rotation, makes his coffee in a dented mug he won’t replace. He’s content, which is wonderful — and somehow makes gift-giving weirdly hard.

A few snapshots of him so you can vibe-check ideas:

* Saturday mornings = pancakes, crossword, oldies on the radio
* Loves fixing things with zip ties and patience (not a pro tool guy, just stubbornly handy)
* Keeps a little box of ticket stubs and postcards from places we’ve been
* Walks the neighborhood at sunset, knows every neighbor’s dog by name
* Says experiences > stuff, but then refuses to plan anything for himself

I’ve considered the usual suspects (wallet/watch/belt) but everything I find feels cookie-cutter. I’d love something thoughtful he’ll actually use or remember. Maybe something that leans into our shared memories or starts a new ritual.

If you’ve nailed a gift for a dad like this, what worked?

* What’s a present you gave your dad that landed better than you expected?
* If you’re a dad, what’s the kind of birthday surprise you’d genuinely be excited about next time?
* Christmas ideas that weren’t just opened and forgotten?
* Father’s Day things that actually made a difference?
* Bonus: ideas for new dads that feel personal, not Pinterest-generic.

I’m especially into gifts that feel more meaningful than pricey — think “story attached,” “we’ll do this together,” or something customizable that isn’t junk. Thanks in advance for any clever, tried-and-true ideas! But the budget can range up to $500 if necessary to make him special.

Hi everyone,

My family and I applied for UK Standard Visitor Visas in July. We got the results after about 10 days. Out of 7 applications, 4 were approved and 3 were refused. Here’s the breakdown:

✅ Approved (4 visas)
	•	Parents: My dad (business owner, sponsor) and my mom (dependent).
	•	Me & my husband: My husband (employed, sponsor) and myself. I run a small grocery business and also bake for my sister’s café and restaurant.

❌ Refused (3 visas)
	•	Sister & her husband: My sister owns a 400sqm coffee shop and was sponsoring her husband.
	•	Brother: Works in government and also owns an events place business in our province.

The refusals are confusing because the three who were denied also have stable ties to the Philippines — businesses, property, and careers. Meanwhile, the rest of us with similar situations were approved.

I’ve attached the refusal letters for the second time (they mostly mention doubts about finances/ties to the Philippines).

My questions:
	1.	Why would some family members with solid businesses/careers be refused when others with similar or less income sources were approved?
	2.	For reapplication, what’s the best way to strengthen their cases? More detailed financials, stronger ties, different sponsor setup?

This is my sister’s 2nd application after being refused and it’s honestly frustrating because she has the most eligibility to be approved. I am certain she provided strong cover letters for her and her husband and yet she was still refused. Would really appreciate any advice from those who’ve been through similar situations.

Thanks!

In Pune, an increasing number of people are seeking smile makeovers to achieve a natural, attractive, and healthy smile. From teeth whitening to advanced full-mouth dental implants, smile makeovers combine science and artistry to create life-changing results.

In this comprehensive guide, we will explore what a smile makeover involves, who benefits the most, the latest treatments available, and how [**Burute Dental**](https://www.burutedental.in/) in Wakad, Pimpri Chinchwad, is helping patients transform their smiles with cutting-edge solutions.

# What is a Smile Makeover?

A smile makeover is a customized dental treatment plan designed to improve the appearance of your smile. Unlike a single cosmetic procedure, it usually combines multiple treatments to address different concerns. Depending on your needs, this may include:

* Teeth whitening for brighter smiles
* Veneers or bonding for chipped or uneven teeth
* Orthodontics for alignment issues
* Dental crowns and bridges for damaged teeth
* Full-mouth dental implants for missing teeth

A skilled [**Dentist in Pune**](https://www.burutedental.in/) will evaluate your oral health, facial features, and personal goals to design a tailored plan.

# Who Needs a Smile Makeover?

Smile makeovers are not only for celebrities—they are for anyone who wants to restore confidence and function in their smile. You may be a candidate if you have:

* **Stained or discolored teeth** – due to coffee, tea, smoking, or aging.
* **Crooked or misaligned teeth** – where orthodontics or clear aligners may be recommended.
* **Chipped, broken, or worn teeth** – requiring veneers, crowns, or bonding.
* **Missing teeth** – where implants or bridges can restore both aesthetics and function.
* **Uneven gum lines** – that can be corrected through gum contouring.

Patients often seek a makeover for personal milestones—weddings, professional advancements, or simply to feel more confident in everyday life.

# The Science Behind Smile Makeovers

Modern dentistry uses digital technology to ensure precision and predictability. Techniques such as **Digital Smile Design (DSD)** allow patients to preview their results before beginning treatment. Advanced 3D imaging and intraoral scanners help dentists plan every detail, from tooth shape and size to color matching.

Scientific studies show that people with well-aligned, white smiles are often perceived as more successful, trustworthy, and approachable. Thus, investing in a smile makeover is more than cosmetic—it can have psychological and social benefits.

# Common Treatments in Smile Makeovers

# 1. Teeth Whitening

Professional whitening treatments can lighten your teeth several shades in just one session, offering long-lasting brightness compared to at-home kits.

# 2. Porcelain Veneers

Ultra-thin shells placed over teeth to correct chips, discoloration, or minor misalignment. Veneers are durable and mimic the natural translucency of enamel.

# 3. Dental Crowns and Bridges

Crowns restore strength to weakened teeth, while bridges replace one or more missing teeth, maintaining bite balance and aesthetics.

# 4. Orthodontics & Clear Aligners

Traditional braces or Invisalign-like clear aligners help straighten crooked or crowded teeth.

# 5. Dental Implants

A gold standard for replacing missing teeth, implants restore both function and aesthetics. At Burute Dental, advanced implant techniques such as **same-day denture implants** in Ravet & Nigdi provide patients with immediate solutions.

# 6. Gum Contouring

For patients with uneven or excessive gum display, reshaping the gum line creates better symmetry.

# Benefits of a Smile Makeover

* **Improved confidence** in social and professional settings.
* **Better oral health** by addressing structural issues.
* **Restored functionality** for chewing and speaking.
* **Youthful appearance** through whiter, straighter teeth.
* **Long-lasting results** with proper care and maintenance.

1nkyeyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1nkyeyy/lunas_choice_chloe_evan/,Luna’s Choice (Chloe & Evan),"""Are you crazy?""
At the mate selection ceremony, I stunned everyone by choosing the outcast—
A masked Alpha in a wheelchair, rumored to have murdered his own mother.
Not Derek, the chirldhood friend who once swore he loved me,
but watched me gone.
When he barged into my mating ceremony, furious and screaming,
I stood beside Evan and said:
“This is my mate. Not you.”
And when Derek called him a cripple—
Evan stood up and walked.
The entire room went silent.
The monster they mocked
was now the man they all feared.
And I?
I finally chose right.
My family is the most powerful werewolf red liquidline in the world—ruling over all the packs across the continent.
And I’m the sole legitimate Alpha heir.
To keep our red liquidline strong, I was required to choose the most powerful, ideal werewolf as my mate.
In my previous life, I chose Derek.
He was the son of my father’s most trusted Beta—impressive, dominant, and my childhood friend.
He filled the gardens with roses, whispered promises, made me believe he was my fated bond—the most loyal partner I could ask for.
But when I was five months along with his child, he locked me in a cage and forced me to watch him with another woman.
""You know what happened the day you chose me?"" he sneered. ""Emily had a miscarriage and lost her parents in a crash. That’s your fault. You owe her.""
Three days later, chaos swept our pack. My father was lost in the battle.
By day five, Derek threw me—still carrying our pup—into a den of rogue wolves.
By day seven, I lost everything.
On the ninth day, I took my final breath.
Just before darkness took me, I heard Derek laugh softly as he held Emily.
""Don’t worry,"" he murmured. ""Her family’s fortune is all yours now.""
This time, I pointed to the one wolf no one dared to approach.
""Him,"" I said.
The room went still.
Evan—the rumored lunatic of the werewolf world.
Scarred. Limping. Said to have caused his mother’s death.
People avoided him like a curse.
But in my last life… when I was broken and bleeding, everyone else laughed or turned away.
Only Evan stepped forward.
He knelt down, pulled out a handkerchief, and wiped the red liquid from my face.
So I chose him.
And one day, the once untouchable Derek would kneel in front of the same cage where I had been shamed—
banging his head against the floor, shattered beyond repair.
. . .
At the head of the long, opulent table sat a dozen middle-aged men in tailored suits—gathered to witness the Alpha heir’s mate selection ceremony.
My Alpha father sat at the center. He beamed with pride.
""Chloe,"" he declared, ""all the werewolves of our pack are here. Choose anyone you wish—and he’ll be your future mate.""
On the table were Moonstones—each etched with a name, a wealth index, and a combat rank.
As the Alpha heir, I held the highest authority. Even if I chose someone already bonded, his previous mating would be nullified. He would belong to me.
My father and his Betas had carefully analyzed the candidate and finally singled out the ten most outstanding ones for me to choose from.
I scanned the stones, one by one, until my gaze landed on the dullest one tucked away in the corner—unpicked, untouched.
Evan’s.
No one ever gave his name a second look.
Scarred face. Crippled leg. Mother gone by his hand, they claimed.
Even his family didn’t think he stood a chance. They only sent their lowest-ranking Beta to witness the ceremony.
But I remembered—when I was locked in that cage in my past life, all the flattering smiles had turned into sneering faces. They laughed. Took pictures. Delighted in my downfall.
Only Evan had come forward.
Just as I was fading away, he pulled a handkerchief from his coat and gently wiped the red liquid from my face.
Without hesitation, I reached out and grabbed his Moonstone.
The room froze.
My father’s face went pale. ""Chloe! You—""
""I choose him,"" I said clearly.
My father stared at me, then slowly slumped back in his chair with a long, heavy sigh.
""Fine. But if he dares lay a finger on you…"" He didn’t finish the sentence—but everyone knew exactly what that threat meant.
As I stepped outside the ceremonial hall, I ran into Derek—and Emily by his side.
Derek was my childhood friend—the one I had long chosen as my mate.
We had agreed—I wouldn’t pick from the Moonstones. I would announce publicly that he was my destined mate.
Emily’s eyes were red-rimmed, her shoulders trembling like she’d just suffered a great injustice.
""Miss Chloe,"" she said tearfully, ""I know you hate me… but that studio was my life’s work. Why did you have to destroy it?""
Derek stepped protectively in front of her, his glare icy.
""Chloe, are you seriously going this far just to make me mate with you? ""
I gave them a calm glance. ""I didn’t do anything."" I turned to leave, but Derek yanked my wrist hard. ""Apologize! Pay for the damages! Or I won’t go through with the mating ceremony!"" Emily tugged at his arm, pretending to plead for me.
""Derek, don’t be like this… you’ll upset Chloe."" Then she turned her tearful eyes to me.
""I’ll kneel if I have to. Just give me back my studio. Please?""
Derek’s anger flared.
""Chloe, you haven’t changed a bit—still throwing your weight around, forcing people to their knees."" ""Emily is my foster sister,"" he added coldly. ""Which makes her your sister too. She’s fragile. Give her the rehab facility under your name. Twenty maids. The best of the best. And a 24/7 medical team.""
I yanked my hand away and laughed out loud.
""Derek, do you think that highly of yourself?"" ""The one I picked today—it wasn’t you.""
Something flickered in Emily’s eyes.
""What did you say?"" Derek’s pupils contracted as he scoffed. ""Stop pretending. You’re just jealous because I treat Emily better.""
I didn’t bother to answer.
I turned and walked away.
Relief surged in me like a tidal wave. This time, I had chosen someone else.
No more Derek. No more nightmare.
The walls were covered with portraits of Emily.There were ones from her teenage years—blushing and shy—others from her college cheerleading days, and even one from her birthday party just last night. Each painting had been meticulously framed and bathed in soft lighting, glowing like sacred treasures.""Do you like them?"" Derek gently brushed her cheek. ""From now on, I’ll give you the most special gift every year on your birthday.""
Emily’s cheeks flushed pink, her voice dripping with sugary sweetness.""Derek, you’re too good to me!""
Then she rose on her toes and pressed a kiss to his cheek.It didn’t take long for the kiss to deepen into something far more intimate.
I let out a cold chuckle and knocked on the doorframe.They sprang apart, startled and flustered.
Derek’s brows furrowed. ""What are you doing here?""
""This is my gallery,"" I said flatly. In my last life, this was the very place where I handed over my family’s business to Derek.Back then, I had joyfully presented him with the most special gift. And how had he treated it? To curry favor with Emily.
After we were bonded, Derek and Emily used to sneak into this gallery to get close behind my back.
Derek smirked, the curve of his lips dripping with mockery.""Why so angry?""
He scoffed. ""Chloe, don’t think I don’t know—you’ve had a crush on me since we were kids. What is this now? Some twisted game of playing hard to get?""
""Give it a rest."" His tone was condescending. ""You’re so obsessed with me—there’s no way you’re really letting me go."" 
I turned cold. ""Pack warriors,"" I commanded, ""throw all this garbage out—paintings and people.""
""No! Don’t!"" Emily suddenly lunged toward me, grabbing at my wrist—but as soon as her fingers brushed mine, she dramatically stumbled and fell into the glass coffee table.
Shards of glass sliced into her leg. red liquid spilled instantly.""Chloe!"" Derek roared and shoved me hard.
I stumbled backward, slamming into a metal easel. Warm liquid trickled down my face—but I couldn’t even feel the pain.Derek grabbed a bucket of red paint and hurled it at me.""Chloe, you’ve gone too far!""
He scooped Emily into his arms and stormed off.
Red paint streamed from my hair and soaked through my white dress.The same crimson color I saw the moment I lost everything in my past life.I collapsed to my knees in the wreckage.
Then a thought struck me—where was my mother’s painting?
The Rose Maiden. 
I scrambled to search, ignoring the red liquid on my face. At last, I spotted it—tucked in a corner, drenched in red paint and ruined beyond recognition. 
""Mom…"" I whispered, clutching the painting to me as tears fell onto the canvas. 
Click… click…The sound of wheels approached, growing louder. 
I looked up and saw a figure sitting just at the edge of the light.A silver mask glinted coldly in the dim gallery light—but it couldn’t hide the slight tremble in his lashes.It was Evan. 
""Stop crying,"" he said quietly, his eyes flicking to the scar on my forehead—then quickly darting away.
""Here."" He held out a tube of ointment. His fingers were long and clean, but they twitched slightly when he noticed I was looking.
""It’ll scar if you don’t treat it."" 
I stared blankly at the medicine in my hand before remembering—Evan’s family controlled nearly the entire medical supply chain for all werewolf packs. 
As I took the ointment, his hand trembled and quickly retreated.""I know you were forced to choose me,"" he said hoarsely, every word measured and slow.""I’ll speak to the pack elders. I’ll ask to break the engagement. You don’t have to suffer this."" 
The wheels of his chair creaked as he began to turn away.""Wait!"" I rushed forward and blocked his path. 
He froze, head turning slightly to the side, clearly trying to hide his face. 
""I meant it,"" I said, looking straight into his eyes. ""The one I chose is you."" 
His knuckles tightened around the armrest of his wheelchair, his ears turning bright red.It was a long time before he finally gave the softest reply—""…Okay."" 
...
Evan had someone deliver a generous supply of rare herbs and supplements to me.
The scar on my forehead had already scabbed over.And every time I changed the dressing, I couldn’t help but recall the way his ears had turned red that day—a small, unexpected warmth blooming inside me. 
Today, I was at the boutique to choose a gown for the upcoming mating ceremony.As I walked in, I heard Emily’s syrupy voice floating through the air. 
""Derek, I love all of these dresses!""
Her hand kept drifting—deliberately—over her stomach as she spoke.
Derek replied indulgently, ""Then get them all. Put it on Chloe’s account."" 
I pushed the door open with a cold smile. 
Derek didn’t look the least bit guilty. In fact, he sounded downright righteous.""You shoved Emily and hurt her last time. Think of this as compensation."" 
Emily’s eyes suddenly lit up as she spotted the coat I was wearing.
""Derek… I really want that one too.""
The sales associate hesitated, ""I’m sorry. That piece is a global limited edition—Miss Chloe pre-ordered it six months ago.""
Emily immediately dropped her gaze and murmured in a wounded voice,""Never mind... I’m just an ordinary Omega. I don’t deserve anything that expensive anyway…""
As she spoke, her hand slid over her belly again. 
Derek’s expression turned pained. He looked at me and demanded, ""Chloe, you've had so many clothes all your life. Let her have this one."" 
I laughed coldly. ""Why should I?"" 
""As compensation,"" he said in a low voice. ""Her knee still hurts from when you pushed her at the gallery."" 
Right then, Emily suddenly stumbled.Derek rushed to catch her, panic in his voice. 
""Are you okay? Are you feeling sick again?""
""I’m fine."" She gave a weak shake of her head, but her hand once again drifted over her stomach—like she wanted to make sure we noticed. 
Derek’s expression hardened.""Chloe. Give her the coat.""
I sneered and called out to the two Pack Warriors stationed at the door.""Throw them both out.""
The warriors looked conflicted. They’d grown up watching me trail after Derek—they weren’t used to disobeying him.""Miss Chloe,"" one of them said hesitantly, ""you’re about to marry Mr. Derek… maybe you should just listen to him…""
Before I could even react, Derek gave them a look—and the next thing I knew, they had slammed me onto the cold marble floor.
""Take it off!"" Derek’s voice barked from above.
The staff stood frozen in shock.
He sneered, ""She’s been chasing me for years. Once we’re married, everything she has will be mine anyway.""
Trembling, the sales associate stepped forward and began undoing the buttons on my coat, her hands shaking violently.
My wrist was still sore from when I hit the metal easel days ago—I couldn’t even muster enough strength to fight back. But my fury boiled beneath my skin. If I were at full strength, I’d rip them all to pieces.
The moment the coat was yanked from my shoulders, my entire body trembled. My wolf inside me was howling.
Derek draped the coat over Emily’s shoulders and smiled sweetly.""You look so much better in it than she ever did.""
Emily bit her lip delicately.""But isn’t this too much…? Miss Chloe might get upset.""
Then, without warning, Derek pulled out his phone and began snapping photos of me—on the ground, disheveled, humiliated.
""Chloe,"" he said coolly, ""try to come after Emily again, and I’ll post these all over the internet. Let’s see what the world thinks of the 'graceful' Miss Chloe on her knees.""
""You monster,"" I hissed, fists clenched so tight my nails dug deep into my palms.
The Derek I saw before me was the same cold figure from my past life. Nothing had changed.
One of the sales associates finally broke under the tension and handed me a silk scarf. I wrapped it around myself, held back my tears, and ran out the door.
When my father saw me, his face twisted in fury.He slammed a vase off the table, shattering it into a hundred pieces.
""Chloe, I never thought Derek would dare treat you like this! I’ll deal with him personally—""
""Father, wait,"" I said calmly, wiping sweat from my brow.
""I’ll handle them myself. But first, take care of those backstabbing Pack Warriors.""
Without hesitation, my father summoned the two men.Their wolf status was stripped on the spot, and they were exiled to the barren borders—no protection, no title, no second chances.
A week before the mating ceremony, I visited the cemetery alone. I gently cleaned the dust off my mother’s headstone.
""Mom,"" I whispered, ""you don’t have to worry. I won’t make the same mistake again.""

It’s been over 3 weeks since our breakup and over 3 weeks since I’ve been asking for my stuff back (one every week) and he says he will post it (didn’t yet).

He was overseas last week but has had ample time to send my few small items over. He reached out yesterday to send me a picture and say he will post it the next day. 

I was in a particularly good mood and although I’m not over what he did to me, I’m over _him_ (and talking to other people) so I decided to ask him for coffee.

Ordinarily, I wouldn’t have done, but I genuinely interpreted him holding my (easily post able items- and at one point, him wanting to drop them in person to my building reception) as orbiting - not busyness or laziness. 

*I ask if he would like to get coffee. I expected a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’.*
The following screenshots ensue. I’m taken aback. This whole chat seems to be going down the toilet so I use it to enquire if he’s monkey branched. Also no dice there. I’m left utterly annoyed and baffled as to why he can’t just say ‘no, I don’t think that’s a good idea’ or ‘I’m too busy rn’??

Bear in mind. I’m not some wanton seductress, nor would I want to jump into bed with someone who just 3 weeks ago catalysed my breakdown and broke my heart (amongst other more heinous acts). 

So the whole ‘no sex’ thing came out of left field. How does grabbing a latte even overlap with that?

Why did he react in this way?

My cousin did point out that I lost some pride by engaging so much but I’m not playing that whole power dynamic, looking cool game. I’m 32, and he’s 37 for goodness sake’s! ",0,1758271891.0,AvoidantBreakUps,3,0.33,False

* How to monitor news 24/7 without going insane myself.
* How to auto-generate “Event → Impact → Action” chains.
* How to map companies, supply chains, and events like some conspiracy wall detective.
* How to boil giant reports into “core takeaway + action step” so users don’t fall asleep.

Not exactly something you slap together in a weekend hackathon. Seven months was me already sprinting like my runway depends on it (spoiler: it kinda does).

Now I can’t stop wondering:

1. Am I just being a perfectionist nerd who over-engineered everything? Or are they just speedrunning their way into chaos with zero concern for sustainability?

So I’m throwing it to you all:

1. In growth hacking land, what wins, quality or speed?
2. Anyone else had this exact “should I ship trash or build gold” crisis?

If you have any other gift ideas please post them below and I may add it to the master list. (Amazon and Walmart is preferred)

At first, I thought cutting ties would make things easier, and in some ways it has. There’s no more constant arguing or trying to meet impossible expectations.

I moved into my own apartment a few months ago, and the first night alone felt weirdly heavy. I mean, I should’ve felt free. But instead, I just kept thinking about the little things we used to do, like grabbing coffee on Sundays. It’s not that I regret the distance, I know it was necessary, but sometimes I catch myself missing having someone who really knew me in that way.

Now I know same for all teas, the brands can make a difference in taste but the one I got was perfect and it has helped me sleep lovely, although odd side effect seems to be insane vivid dreams but I feel so much more refreshed after sleep. I cannot however, find this brand anywhere online that ships to Ireland and I am wondering if I could get some advice from locals who drink it that could recommend another one I could get that would be similar?

1nky2s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1nky2s3/hard_lessonsreflection/,Hard Lessons/reflection,"There's nothing more heartbreaking than being unable to provide. Being broke when you're alone is something you can manage. But inability to provide for the people you love ... Like your aging parent? Or girlfriend/woman..

A scenario where your parent is in an emergency but you can't help. 

Gets even painful and embarassing being unable to provide for your woman. She's just there, trusting on the process with you. Well, she has other options ... she can leave for another man or go to her home where her parents can provide. Or when she's from a higher social-economic class. But she chooses to stick with you. Doesn't complain. Encouraging you. When she asks you for very small amounts but you don't have... after she spent all her money for the house in previous week...


Gets worse when she starts chipping in - like paying bills here and there... Electricity, some groceries... Helping you manage the situation.  But no matter how hard you try, the breakthrough is nowhere... just promises of ""hope this is going to work"", ""there's a client I'm waiting for"" then the client decides to run ...

When eating her money, it feels like you're suffocating and choking on your own tears... You even have to pretend you're full so that you don't eat. 
But then when you're broke and stressed, the appetite is at its peak. You've anger issues ... You start feeling like everyone is out to get you or looking down on you. You can't even use social media or touch your phone - so it doesn't seem like you're idling yet no money. 

It leaves you feeling so useless that it becomes funny especially if she's younger than you say 3 years 😂. 

You can't even tell her ""hey, maybe you visit your parents for a week or two, when you come back things will have gotten better"" coz she will start thinking you don't love her anymore or you are up to something fishy, yet she's down for you. Doesn't care her family's English breakfast or 3 meals a day - balanced diet, she wants to be there with you, with you black coffee and mandazi for breakfast.

* **Started out with ""coffee shop"" videos.** Many are several hours long, with espresso machine and clinking mug sounds (like ASMR for coffee shop lovers). Made me feel like I was out in the world and not as alone.

* **Public library ""feeds.""** Many are called ""feeds"" but they're more like recordings of live sessions from someone sitting at a table in the library and filming it.

shame and finally acceptance.

From Han Kyul's POV - He starts being friends with a man,spends time with him and their friendship grows strong but as days pass he feels different 
kind of attraction to that man and keeps fighting his various feelings like jealousy,crush,love towards him.A doubt arises within him regarding his sexuality i.e his entire life he believed himself to be a straight man but his feelings for Eun Chan makes him question his entire life reality,which he is unable to understand and accept..Having fought those feelings for so long,he decides to give up fighting and accept the person he loves for what he is,rather than quitting and rejecting love which is a much easier option both personally and socially.

He decides to change himself and accept that love.He even suggests to move to a place where they will be accepted. We have seen stories like man dying for his women and all but here it seems so real.Like there are people amongst us fighting to accept their different sexuality,love they experience etc.This show is far ahead of its time!

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?
