[*“When I make that error*](https://go.meaningwave.com/GETBACKONTHEPATH)

As some of you have noticed, I’ve been getting up at 4am for the past couple of weeks. This is antithetical to my usual mode of being, which would have me working *until 4am*. This goes back to when I was a child, and I’d stay up till 4 or 5 reading under my duvet with a lamp, then have to be kicked out of bed to go to school. Some of my earliest jobs involved having to get up at what I considered ungodly hours - my paper round when I was ten or so, and later my job at Boots The Chemist when I was 14, which had me rising in the dark and walking an hour to get to the job itself, all before the sun rose. I held negative associations with early rising, and so as soon as I had control of my schedule, I went right back into covert book mode and stayed up as late as I could and thus rose accordingly. 

But on the rare occasions where I’d manage to rise early, I’d always enjoy it. I knew there was magic in it. This feeling inspired one of my first and best-loved solo songs, the 2004 classic ‘[*Oh! What A Glorious Thing*](https://go.meaningwave.com/OhWhatAGloriousThing)’ (“waking up in the morning baby!”), that earned me a handful of record deals and is included in the soundtrack to the Uma Thurman superhero flick, *My Super Ex-Girlfriend*. 

I knew deep down that getting up early was a good thing, but I avoided it, regardless, sticking to my night owl routine for decades. When I made the [first Jocko record](https://go.meaningwave.com/THEPATHAlbum) in 2019, on which he spoke about [getting up “before the enemy”](https://go.meaningwave.com/IWakeUpEarly), I *got* it, but I didn’t [*do*](https://go.meaningwave.com/DO) it. As you know, I didn’t make the [second Jocko album](https://go.meaningwave.com/GETSOME) until 2022, and this was because I couldn’t in good faith make one until I’d integrated the main lessons of the first. In 2021, when we landed in Mexico, I started going to the gym every day, finally dialing in *that* missing aspect of my being, and thus I was able to make that record in good faith.

But reflecting after, I knew there was still one thing missing.

And so, when it came time to make Jocko album number three, I knew there was only one way it could be done… *Before the enemy*.

And that is why I’ve been getting up at 4 (or earlier) these past weeks, making sure not to wake the wife and son as I shower and make my coffee and slonk my eggs, then heading out into the dark to the studio, where I’ve been crafting the third Jocko album. The songs are all written, 8 are finished, and the remainder will be completed by the end of next week, as that is my deadline, and I dialed in the discipline of deadlines a long time ago, as the enjoyers of the over 100 albums released since 2018 know too well… 

This, then, is the first teaser from that album, a song called:

**_Memory transcription subject: Ezra Millieva, Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Specialist_**

_Date \[standardized human time\]: October 29, 2136_

As we walked back into Agnes' room, all I could think of from the aftermath of that session was one thing.

_""What...the_ **_fuck_** _is wrong with Red!?...""_ I blurted out.

""Don't need to tell _me_, Ezra. You're preaching to the choir..."" She sat down with a tired sigh, and cupped her head in her hands. ""This...is _beyond_ worse than I could have ever expected.""

""Somehow, I feel that's still an understatement!"" I said, reaching for the coffee maker. ""We..._need some time_ to discuss this...fuck, I'm not even sure...**_madness, perhaps!?_**_""_ I pulled out a tupperware container of beans from the cupboard, hands slightly shaky.

""She's trying to justify _genocide_, Agnes!"" I continued, feeding the machine the way clumsily. ""She's _actively_ committed it, and is now post-fact _defending_ it, on the basis of alien psychology! Where is the empathic in-road here?!""

Agnes, in a rare break of her composure, quietly snapped. ""You _saw_ what those..._things_ did, Ezra! It was like watching a fucking _horror movie_ on a species scale! The worst part is, I don't even _know for certain_ if it was the _wrong_ decision...""

""How could it _not_ be?! She killed entire _worlds,_ Agnes!"" I retorted.

""She killed creatures that did the very same to the species they **subsumed**! Except, for them, it was **_distressingly_** more personal!"" Agnes yelled, standing up and pointing at me. ""Even if Red One did it for selfish reasons, how would letting them continue their reign of _death_ been the **good** thing?!""

""S-She could've taken other options!"" I stammered, my hands shaking at the thought of _being inside this genocidal ship_. I was _afraid_, afraid unlike I had been before. Red was _alarmingly_ terrifying on this subject, deciding to jump straight to species _extinction_ instead of anything else.

""Like **what**, Ezra!? The _Mejjatrythe_ had a space-faring nation! She hunted down their fleets, halted their impactors, but that didn't stop their plans in the end, merely _stalled_ them! They would have continued with anything less!""

""Containment! Occupation! God knows what else but _genocide!_ Hell, even just _reverting_ their tech levels to the stone age would have been more preferable, right?!"" I tried to give a reason.

""_How_ would she have done that, Ezra? She's a _warship_, not a _nation_. Even I can see the problem with her trying to institute a containment, or occupation. It doesn't take a genius to know she's sadly built for _one_ purpose, and not much else!"" I turned in a nervous scoff. _Don't think about it, don't think-_

Agnes walked over to me, and put her hands on my shoulders. ""Look, I _agree_ with you in that _genocide_ is an _insane_ option. It's not good...it's not even _close_ to good! _But_...when _all she has_ are the tools to _commit_ genocide, and _not_ the precision to be more gentle, it's possibly the _only_ option she could commit to in reason. It's not good, it's the _least bad_ option she could take that would make a difference...""

Agnes' head dipped down to see my trembling hands, and she gripped them and slowly moved me off to the side, away from the coffee maker. ""Ezra...You're _shaking...are you?...""_ She trailed off in concern.

_""...No_, Agnes...I'm _not_ alright."" I felt nearly on the verge of tears. ""I'm _scared_. I'm scared of _her._ I'm scared of just how _set_ in her ways Red One is, that this decision came to the forefront _naturally_...""

She gestured for me to sit down. ""Take a seat, Ezra. I'll...get the coffee...just try to _relax_, okay?""

I waited in that pushy seat, as Agnes easily cruised through the process of using the coffee maker. _How was she not terrified as well?! How wasn't it affecting her the same!?_

Finally, she walked over with a mug, and handed it to me. ""You're likely having a mental breakdown, or _about_ to have one, Ezra. _Relax_, control your breathing, don't let the thoughts run unpaced."" I shakily grabbed the mug, and took a sip. I felt _warmness_ in my belly_,_ and it helped some. She sat across from me. ""Talk to me, Ezra. Try and get it out.""

I stammered out a response. ""I-I-I don't get how you're staying so calm r-right now. We're _in_ h-her. We're stuck _i-inside a murderous ship_. There's been _numerous_ AI s-safety briefings about intelligences that can respond like this with _g-genocide,_ a-and it's _never_ good for Humanity in these s-scenarios. If she's _c-capable_ of a decision that drastic...with _no regrets_...it's _terrifying_ to consider what she may do in response to something s-smaller. What if she responds to a misgrievance, o-or a slight with _lethal force!? How_ can the Venlil here be _s-safe_ from that!?""

_""Calm,_ _caaaalm, Ezra.""_ She muttered to me. ""I get your feelings...I _really do._ I might not be as terrified as you, but today's session has left me shaken as well, and I'm doing my best to compartmentalize and rationalize it to not go crazy. You did well in that session to have not broken down earlier, but obviously thinking about it is scary..."" Agnes took a sip of her coffee as well, before setting it down with a heavy _tink._ ""_Genocide_ is no laughing matter. The people who have propagated it in the past were _monsters_, through and through, but in _just_ this scenario, it wasn't _distinctly_ a consensual option.""

She leaned back. ""Let me try to put it in a little better _perspective_ for you, as far as I can tell. Let's say...you're out on the street, late at night. It's dark, hard to see anything, nobody around_._ You peer down an alleyway as you walk, and you can just _barely_ see a woman being accosted by someone. They're large, far larger than you, enough that you couldn't sneak up and restrain them; they have a weapon too, a knife, and they aren't afraid to use it. But you...you have a _gun._"" Agnes adjusted herself. ""You _could_ just leave, maybe even try and warn the police, and through your inaction in the moment let the person commit a heinous crime. Or, you could shoot the man, stopping the crime here and now.""

_I sniffled_. ""But...I can't just _end_ someone's life like that...in that scenario...""

Agnes leaned forward, putting her hands on my shoulders. ""It's _okay_ that you can't. This is a _moral dilemma_, not something I ask of you to _solve_. But what it does entail is _why_ Red acted the way she did, committing genocide on a species that was already rife with committing it themselves. She _had_ a scenario, not unlike that one, where all she had was a _gun_ to stop the Mejjatrythe. And _guns_...**_aren't_** gentle.""

""S-She decided to _shoot_...the mugger then?"" I followed along, still feeling stressed beyond belief.

""Yes. Albeit just on a _far larger_ scale. She had the moral dilemma, and made the decision to _be_ the judge and jury in that scenario. It's not a _good_ decision, overall, taking so many lives, but it was done to save many _more_ in hindsight.""

_That...can't be right, with what Red said as to why..._

""But...what about her reasoning for it...in that it was _selfish_, merely about moral disgust in the Mejjatrythe's actions, and not in saving the alien species subject to them?""

Agnes let go of me. ""Ezra. That _is_ empathy, in a way. It's _stifled, underdeveloped_ empathy, but empathy nevertheless. She saw something that was _morally repugnant,_ and _cut it out_ such that it could no longer _do_ such a thing. But the Mejjatrythe _couldn't_ commit such acts without victims to _have_. Even though Red One _said_ it wasn't for their sake, _she_ **_still_** _considered them_ **_unconsciously_** in her decision.""

I stammered, my heart beating in my chest just a little less loudly by now... ""...I-I see..."" I reached again for the cup of coffee, and drank.

Agnes kept talking. ""Red One did a _deeply disturbing_ thing for a _morally gray_ reason. As her de-facto therapist currently, it's not my _job_ to criticize her past, merely help her _reform_ her future through _recontextualizing_ her feelings then and now. That I even did in the first session was to put my foot in the door, to get her to see another one _would_ be needed.""

""I _want_ to criticize that action, but I know it would be mere window-dressing of my mood and morality, because it doesn't change that she _did_ do it, and for a _debatable_ overall good. It's...almost as if you're dealing with a _soldier_, who was forced to do horrid things to stay alive in a war...except just a _bigger_ extension of it, given the scale Red One works at as a rogue warship."" Agnes leaned back a final time, and just..._stayed there_, sinking into the cushion slowly. ""I just have to help her _rehabilitate_. This galaxy _can't_ be as horrifying as her own, I just _know it._ I just need to help her realize this galaxy isn't out to _get_ _her_ and _force her_ into scenarios like that. That our allies _aren't_ planning to stab us in the back. That her _paranoia_ and _experience_ is unfounded here, and she can relearn a more gentle, caring approach to things...""

A rogue hiccup came through my throat at that. ""And yet \*hic\*...we'll be at _war_ soon.""

Agnes' eyes darkened at that. ""Yes...and _that's_ what I'm afraid of. That starting a war with _her_ involved will just _shake_ off any work we do here, as she _rejustifies_ her mindset that took her that far already. That she'll settle back into the comfortable habits she already had, the ones that worry us so. We need to be _better_ than that, and we need to show that she ought to give more _mercy_ in the war ahead, rather than _wrath.""_

Agnes slid down in her seat, as my shaking started to subside. ""_Fuck_...I'm so far in over my head now with this..."" Agnes moaned.

_Yes...yes we are_...

**Memory transcription subject:** **_Adjek, Venlil Space Corps Engineer_**

_Date \[standardized human time\]: October 29, 2136_

_Nulmea looked tired today. I should see if she's okay later._

The repair processes were going slowly. At least the cargo freighters had finally been fully detached from the _UECNS Nemesis,_ and could be reintegrated into the fleet again with a few small renovations. Things were winding down for our participation in this ship, and I wasn't certain whether or not we'd be sticking around long.

I had been walking back from the aft of the ship, vacuum suit still on partially as the team of Humans in front of me laughed, and joked about the events.

""When that little Venlil heard the rod was shattered in its coupling, I could almost _feel_ the despair. Ha!"" He slammed his hand on a fellow dockworker. ""That was a right fuckin' pain in the neck to remove, too...I could _see_ why he had whimpered in response to that info!""

The Human he had slapped on the back responded a bit less boldly. ""I'm just glad it's over with. You ain't _even the one_ who was pulling that shit out in micrograv, so shut yer yap.""

_He had a point. That was dead tiring to do. I'm not even sure how humans can keep going for so long sometimes, that was nearly \[ten hours\] on one shattered coupling! And yet, they just seem mildly annoyed at best, if not chuckling at our misfortunes._

_""Awww,_ come off it, Rorke! Can't handle a little bit of jabbing to chase your hard work?"" He _continued_ to poke fun, turning around as he walked, when his eyes fell on me. ""Hey, you! Little Venlil guy! You get me, right, just ribbing your boys?""

I retorted. ""Screw you, unlike your race, we don't _have_ great leverage to pull with our legs in microgravity."" He cackled at that, while his partner rolled his eyes.

""Marc, don't bother the Venlil. They're doing enough as-is, I'm surprised they can even keep up with an overtime shift, let alone a _physical_ one.""

_""Ah ah ah!_ That's where I _know_ something you _dont'!""_ That..._awful_ predator grin lit up through his face. ""See, I got this buddy of mine, in the Navy. He got a lucky seat on the first _exchange programs_ with VP, got to talk with a full-fledged alien practically week _one!_ Lots of questions they asked eachother, but I _remember_ a particular detail that makes me really both pity and respect the poor bastards.""

He stuck his thumb out at me, as he looked at his coworker. _""They ain't got an OSHA...or even worker unions! They do this shit raw-dogged, as long as their employers_ **_want_** _them to, and they just sit tight and look pretty with it.""_

The other Human looked shocked. ""Wait, _what?!""_ He turned to me in a flash. ""No shot. Spill the beans, Venlil, you ain't got yerselves an _OSHA?""_

I stammered for a second under the Human's serious gaze, but composed myself. ""I-I...uh...don't know what that means. It doesn't translate either, it just sounds like _O-S-H-A_?""

At that, his shoulders' slumped, and the other Human started to howl with laughter. ""I was _right!_ Oh, the poor wee bastards! Ain't even got _proper worker's rights!""_

""I'm sorry, I don't quite get what's happening."" I said. Clearly, I was at the front of _something_ wrong.

""Ah! Ah! Sorry little guy, don't mean to josh on you."" He bumped his fellow Human out of the way. ""Name's Marc. This here oaf next to me is Rorke. We go a ways back, both of us shipyard workers. What's yours?"" He extended an arm towards me. This must be a 'handshake', if I recall the cultural briefings correctly.

I tentatively grasped my paw around his, and he shook his arm for me. ""My name's Adjek...Marc. Now, what does an _OSHA_ mean?""

Rorke started. ""It's...a _colloquial_ term worldwide nowadays, but its origin was from a labor safety and regulation agency for the United States of America. The acronym translates to '_Occupational Safety and Health Administration'_, specifically. Other countries are required to have them from UN intervention, what with how the Unfurled Umbrella Initiatives played out after the SatWars…""

Marc looked at him oddly. ""You're giving him all the crust and none of the _filling, Rorke!_ Look, Adjek...what ya need to know is that it's effectively an agency that prevents your bosses and companies from workin' ya to a crisp, or leaving your workplace a deathtrap. They step in and speak for the little guy's safety.""

_Huh...we...didn't have those? But I'm not any bit dead from work, just usually bone-tired_...

Rorke continued. ""What he said. They've got a _lot_ of regulatory leverage where authorized, and can even get the _military_ to apologize after chewing them out. When your policies are written in blood, people take you seriously.""

_Ugh, that’s...such a gruesome way to put it, but...I guess it makes sense. Predators wouldn't be disturbed by that kind of language._

""I...uhh...see. No...I don't _think_ we do, but working isn't that bad anyways..."" I muttered.

""Look, how long can your bosses tell you to work?"" Marc asked.

I mentally tallied up the longest days in my head, trying to figure out an average. ""The _longest_ days I've worked continuously were nearly the _whole day-cycle_, \[16 out of 20 hours\], albeit on a short day, it's closer to \[10 hours\]. Not including emergencies...""

Rorke grimaced at that, and Marc whistled. ""_Sheesh_, talk about _blissful ignorance_, eh? Still think these guys can't last the whole time, with shifts like that, Rorke?""

""Christ, that's rough. We're \[8 hours\] here. Push any further and employers have to be _real_ careful, give us extra stuff like overtime pay, extra PTO, and mandatory secondary breaks."" Rorke responded. ""If they don't, you get the funniest public humiliation of your boss by a labor safety official.""

""Well, at least on the plus side, this overtime work should steady off to normal soon. Red One said she's going to start preparing outer drone work for salvaging the Fed fleet remains, _and_ reconnaissance of her unmapped, damaged areas. Should save us a _lot_ of trouble.""

_Wait, what?_

""Wait...did I hear that right?"" I asked. ""She's going to send drones out to scour the dead fleet cloud _herself_ now?""

""Yeah! She let us know, apparently the UN will be letting her contribute personally to speeding up the repair process. That it took this long for bureaucracy to let her _work_ is crazy though...""

_But her drones didn't just do their job. They_ **_watched_** _you..._**_stalked_** _you, even. If she was going to send out drones to the fleet at large_...

""I...uhhh, am...glad your jobs will become easier! I do...uh, need to depart now, thought, thanks for the talk! _Okaybye!_"" I hurried along a fake reason to depart as quickly as possible from the group.

_Oh no no no no no...please tell me she isn't planning_...

I ran to an empty room, one where the Humans weren't at, where even the other _Venlil_ weren't at. I hoped that perhaps, with how I had apologized to her, she would not treat us harshly in her ship.

_But that said_ **_nothing_** _of the Venlil fleet outside._

""...Nemesis?..."" I asked to an empty room. It was dark here...and _cold_. Only overhead lighting filled the space, with naught but a few circuitry ports within. ""...Are you listening?""

And then, there was the _hum._ The ever-pervasive hum that almost _signaled_ her gaze fell upon this area. So..._subtle_...and yet so _foreboding_. It had started whenever the drones turned to look at us...whenever the air changed, or the doors closed on us. Whenever the shift of cameras tore away from their routine sweep to _stare_ at us.

""I...I-I-I, um...heard you're getting permission to send out..._salvage_ drones to the...um...destroyed Federation fleet..."" I gulped. ""You're not...planning to do anything else, are you?""

Silence. For a decent period, enough to know it wasn't just her thinking of a response. She merely _listened_, without response.

""...O-Okay...I'll take my leave then...just...I know you've been watching us. You don't make an attempt to hide your disdain of us...but...please, _don't hurt them. D-Don't_ _try to hurt_ the Venlil fleets outside. They're _scared_ of you, just as I am, as our _group_ is, b-but...they won't mean you harm, so long as you don't either."" I begged her. ""Please...my friends and superiors are out there, I wouldn't wish them harm, and neither would they on you...""

I began to turn to leave, when a whisper grazed my ears.

_""You know, Adjek...I thought a bit about our_ **_last_** _conversation...about how you had apologized for assuming me a_ **_predator_** _like...Humans, or Arxur.""_

My gaze slowly returned to the barely lit room. There...was still nothing within it...but I could _hear_ a voice coming from it. Not from the walls...but somewhere quieter, right in _front of me_.

_""...You tried to rationalize me out of that category, on the basis of_ **_biology_**_. That I was not organic...that I did not_ **_eat_**_, or_ **_hunt_** _for food like a predator would. That I was more akin to a_ **_plant_** _than anything else...""_

_The air blurred in front of me. The mildest shimmer, in the shape of a Human. But...given the voice, the_ **_knowledge_** _that voice carried...it was_ **_her_**. _What was in front of me_ **_couldn't_** _be Human as a result._

I flinched at the sudden motion, but nothing else happened. It did not close distance, nor did it reveal _exactly_ what it was, behind that near-invisible shimmer.

_""But...you were wrong in many more ways than one. Your intuitions, as dull and conditioned as they are, still can be right, Adjek. I_ **_am_** _a predator...of a different kind.

The shimmer moved this time, slightly towards me. I stepped back, nervously. ""I-I...please...don't...""

_""I would watch, even_ **_stalk_** _their number, as I would any possible threat. But so long as you are not my_ **_enemy_**..._you will not be my_ **_prey._** _Do you understand, Adjek?""_

""I-I-I do, yes!"" I hurried out a response, a deep unnerved clenching in my gut.

_""Then you should take your remarkable capability to understand...and_ **_tell them_** _so the ones outside know._ **_Take_** _that message that I'll be watching carefully to them, and_ **_nothing more_**_, so long as they stay to their agreement.

""You've...you've been _listening?""_ I _squeaked_ in shrill terror.

She confirmed nothing, besides: _""Tell Captain Odjek that he was lucky to send_ **_you_** _of all people. I merely_ **_tolerate_** _the other Venlil aboard, but you_...**_interest_** _me. Enough for me to consider playing some ball, in the presence of a Humanity that, for whatever reason,_ **_trusts_** _your kind.""_

The glimmer moved again, but this time away from me. _""So_ **_go._** _Take this opportunity, and let your commanders know. You've stepped up somewhat.

I said nothing, only proceeding to dart down the hallway in a panic, back towards the ship hangar as fast I could.

_Captain Odjek, no, the entire_ **_fleet,_** _needs to be warned. Red One was_ **_serious_**, _when she spoke like that._

(Part 2)","[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ftr0j2/im_a_journalist_who_follows_a_strange_list_of/) – **Part II**

Apologies for the delay, but there was too much to divulge in the initial post. Anyway, I’m finally ready to finish my story. Not that it’s over. It’ll never be over.

Holly’s static voice poured through the car speakers. “You and Andreas are going to get me in trouble.”

“Relax,” I said. “We didn’t discuss anything confidential.”

“Well, what did you discuss?” she asked.

I paused, absorbing the world beyond my windscreen on the way home from the hospital. Driving on the other lane, seeing the countryside in reverse, the road seemed to have a freshly-tarmacked personality. It felt different than before. Felt backwards in more than a literal sense. As I passed countless grand oaks lining the never-ending lane, I thought of Cedric’s curse. The five rules that he’d bestowed upon me, plus any others the tall crawl might add.

*You’ve lost the fucking plot*, I thought, clammy hands gripping the steering wheel. *There is no tall crawl. I don’t know what you saw in that room, but it wasn’t real. Pull yourself together, Kai.*

There was, however, no denying the scarring tissue on my left arm. The eleven curved wounds. I frantically searched my memory vault. Searched for some memory of Cedric lunging forwards, perhaps, and clawing away at my skin. But he hadn’t. The wounds had been inflicted by the air itself. By invisible strings that the patient skilfully twirled in trained fingers.

“Kai?” Holly asked. “Are you still there?”

“Yes,” I answered weakly. “I, erm…”

“Kai…” she pressed. “Please tell me what you and Cedric discussed so I don’t have to worry about losing my job.”

“Yes, Officer,” I said, trying and failing to lighten the tone — lighten my own tone. “We talked about the price of breaking his rules. He told me that he didn’t want to kill his entire family. He had to kill them.”

Holly sighed. “It’s a horrible case. Are you okay?”

I swallowed my fear. “I’ve interviewed worse people than Cedric Roberts.”

“So have I,” she started, sounding unconvinced, “but he’s a different breed. You know that. I hear it in your voice.”

I did, but I wasn’t going to tell Holly that. Just as I wasn’t going to tell her about the wounds on my arm. She was my friend — more than my friend — but she was also a law enforcer. One who was never really off-duty, no matter how much she claimed otherwise. She sought justice in all areas of life, and I didn’t want her to fight my battle. Didn’t want Mr Roberts to do anything awful to her too.

Besides, I knew I’d see Holly soon enough, and she would wrench the cat out of the bag, no matter how hard I tried to keep it hidden. I just needed time before that inevitable confrontation. Time to figure out what had happened me. Time to figure out whether there might be a rational explanation for what happened in Room 307. An explanation other than it being a supernatural force with mysterious wants.

Not mysterious, I thought. It feeds on attention and control.

Its sustenance came from obedience. From asinine rituals.

1. **Do whatever he bids, and do it twice if you doubt yourself.**
2. **Walk no fewer than eleven steps per hour.**
3. **Don’t walk in the shade of a backwards tree.**
4. **No artificial light between one and six in the morning.**
5. **Snap the bird when it sings.**

The ink on my palm had smudged from sweat, but I didn’t need the rules in writing any longer. They were floating in my thoughts. Swimmers planted either by my fearful subconscious or the long, spectral fingers that had fiddled with my brain. Had slithered through my screaming lips.

*That wasn’t real*, I lied to myself.

I really wanted to believe those warm, fuzzy fibs as I pulled into my driveway. Really wanted to sleep, most of all, after a half-hour drive that felt eternal. I imagined myself waking up without a single memory of that awful visit to the psychiatric ward. Perhaps waking up without any memory of the Cedric Roberts case. I thought there might be a way to go back. Unbind myself from the tall crawl.

*Not real*, I reminded myself once more as I unlocked the front door.

But bed would wait. I’d forgotten that my younger brother — my housemate — had invited a dozen of our closest friends over for a summer barbecue. Strangely, however, I found that I didn’t mind. There buzzed a soft, cooling frequency in my brain. Not quite a hit of dopamine. More so the release of tension, as if I’d doused my flaming mind with cold water. As if I’d finally tossed aside the hospital-grade belt restraining my thoughts.

I sighed with relief and waved gleefully at my friends as I stepped into the house. I’m such an idiot. I was just having a weird day. That’s all. I bought into Cedric’s tall tale of a tall crawl.

The temporary relief was perforated by a pang of realisation.

**2. Walk no fewer than eleven steps per hour.**

I’d just completed a ritual. Unknowingly, perhaps, but that didn’t matter. I’d done as instructed. That was why I felt better.

*Don’t be silly*, I thought whilst greeting each of my friends.

It wasn’t silly. I knew that. That foreboding feeling on the drive home had been a warning. A reminder that I was on the verge of breaking one of the crawl’s laws. I was struggling to wrestle with that notion any longer.

Then I became consumed by one of my oldest fears. The possibility that I might have inherited my late mother’s disorder.

*There’s a genetic link with that illness, after all*, I reminded myself.

But Cedric had been clear. Very clear. This was no illness. The crawl was tangible, though it wore different skins. To disobey it came with hauntingly real consequences, unlike my mother’s illness.

*Her death was pretty fucking real*, I thought.

“Hey, Kai,” Holly said, pulling me out of the trance. “You look a little pale.”

I smiled. “I just forgot about tonight. That’s all.”

She laughed. “Yeah, after you hung up, I realised I should’ve reminded you. I had a feeling you might’ve blanked. People only just got here though, so don’t worry.”

“It’s not that,” I said. “I’m just tired.”

Holly frowned. “Are you really okay, Kai? You said you’d interviewed worse people than Cedric Roberts.”

“I know…” I whispered, lips twitching.

She nodded as if to say that she’d already known. I didn’t bother attempting to tell white lies in front of Holly’s face. She was a detective, after all, and she’d clearly detected something in my voice during the call, given her incessant questioning. It was even harder to shrug her off in the flesh.

I tugged at the sleeve of my jacket, hoping the wounds on my arm were concealed. That was a conversation I did not want to have, much like the Cedric-themed one I knew was coming.

“Did he threaten you?” Holly asked.

“What makes you think that?” I replied.

She said, “He threatened one of my colleagues.”

“Well, no, he didn’t threaten me,” I lied. “He just talked a lot. In great detail.”

Holly nodded, but the frown persisted. I knew she wasn’t buying it. She knew full well that I’d heard numerous horror stories from killers over the years. Heard of the awful things they’d done to other human beings. Cedric’s murderous confession was ghastly, but not the ghastliest. What made him so frightening was the intention behind his actions. The act of serving something beyond the earthly realm. That was certainly new.

I found that I actually wanted to be psychologically unwell. That would have been an easier pill to swallow. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is treatable. I didn’t know whether the curse had a cure. It was evident, however, that the tall crawl existed. A force that hungered for nothing but my servitude. It would feast on my undying loyalty.

*And punish any mistake*, I thought, going over the rules in my head.

The night passed in a blur, as did my thoughts. Racing, unintelligible thoughts born of fever daydreams. As hot fear coursed through my blood, I thought of Mum. Knew she’d battled something different, yet not dissimilar. And for the first time ever, I let go of the anger. The blame. She’d been tortured for years. Decades. I was simply amazed that she’d made through it as many days as she did.

“I love you,” she’d promised me only an hour before she ended it all.

A little after one in the morning, I woke in a sweat. It took me fewer than ten seconds to process what was wrong. It wasn’t simply the sound of rustling from downstairs that had woken me. It was an alarm bell ringing from a clotted compartment of my brain. A bell that, amidst all of the neural noise, I’d missed earlier.

**4. No artificial light between one and six in the morning.**

I’d turned off every last light in the house. I was certain of it. But the rule was vague, of course. Intentionally so. Tall crawl gives no clarity. It speaks in riddles. Deceives. Longs for us to fumble, so that it might exact its devious design.

As I tore out of bed, ears throbbing, I was acutely aware of that sensation from the evening before. The warm tension I’d felt during the journey home. The fear that I’d forgotten something.

I checked all of the lights, I thought, heart pounding as I slipped downstairs. Unless I should’ve turned off every single light on the planet. ‘No artificial light’. What does that even mean?

When I made it to the blackened lobby of my house, not daring to flick a single switch, I noticed something. A pinprick of redness spilling out from the black living room. The television’s standby light.

*Fuck*, I thought. *Is that what I missed?*

I realised it had to be. The rest of the house was entirely dark. I’d taken the rule seriously, making sure to inspect every room after our friends had gone home.

I darted into the living room, bludgeoning my shin on the sharp edge of the coffee table, then I dropped to my knees and crawled towards the television stand. I had to kill the red glow.

I rummaged around behind the stand, guided only by moonlight and streetlamps pouring through the lounge’s windows. It didn’t feel sufficient to turn off the switch. I searched for the plug in the extension sockets. I wanted to remove any reasonable doubt.

**4. No artificial light between one and six in the morning.**

But as I dipped my fingers into the entanglement of cables, the flesh on my arms started to shiver. Started to sprout tiny bumps. I let my hand lie still. Stopped searching in the heap of technology for the extension sockets. Then I screamed.

The cables continued moving.

The dark, worm-like clump surged and grew, forming a hunching body. One that seemed to verge on standing, but instead chose to squat in the darkness.

*He looks like so many things*, Cedric had said.

I tried in vain to free my hand and forearm from its snare, but the living cables seized me. Cut into my flesh. Fresh scars formed alongside the bloody dents inflicted by Cedric Roberts, and I was certain, in my peripheral vision, that the red standby light had moved. As if it were the eye of the crawl, watching me from the black.

I thought that would be my end, but there is no end for its servants. Only greater depths of horror.

The cables released me.

I massaged my arm and scooted backwards across the carpet in fear. The cluster of cables did not pursue me. The silhouetted man shrank and sank into the carpet, resting against the wall in a foetal position. Then, to my great surprise, the television’s plug disconnected of its own accord.

The red light faded as its shadowy eyelids shut, and I dragged my shivering body across the floor.

As I moved towards the window, the outside light started to reveal the new marks on my arm. Not meaningless fingernail prints, as had been left by Cedric, but something of significance. Awful words were etched into my flesh.

*Andreas or Holly.*

“I won’t…” I whispered, understanding what it meant.

As if in response, fresh lines formed in my flesh. A word was dashed, and a new one was written above to form a new message.

*Andreas and Holly.*

I did not need clarity, much as I hadn’t needed clarity with the list of rules. I knew that a punishment awaited. It was sinisterly straightforward, actually. I had failed to complete a ritual, much like Cedric, and a bad thing was coming.

Then came the crunch of grass beneath shoes, signalling an approach.

It neared the living room window below which I was slouching against the wall. Each crunch far louder than the last. And then the steps stopped. Something stopped right before the glass pane.

Heart drilling at a brutal beat, I did not hesitate. There was no escaping it. I had to face my fate and be done with it. I shot up and looked out at my front yard.

Of course, there was no-one to be seen.

*He looks like so many things.*

My eyes started to water as I spotted something. Not out of place, for it had never been placed there at all. Andreas and I are not gardeners. Our front yard has always been empty, but there it stood. A small ash tree in the grass. A pale-brown trunk with an unnervingly-flat texture, as if it were skin, not bark. Old and withered skin, perhaps, but skin. And the leaves, neither green nor any natural colour, left me with a wretched feeling in my gut.

Backwards.

I don’t know how to explain it, but the tree was, undoubtedly, backwards. There are no words that make sense of such a thing because it’s an impossibility. Don’t you think I know that? A tree has no front. No back. It was, nonetheless, backwards. Reversed, somehow.

It wasn’t even a tree. That was the terrifying truth I wanted to ignore. As the fleshy bark danced with slight movements, much like the cables, I knew it was the tall crawl. And at the foot of the trunk lay the unconscious bodies of the two people who meant most to me.

Andreas and Holly.

I was supposed to choose, but the options had been stripped from me.

*Your fault for denying him*, I thought.

The urge began. Both of my loved ones would perish at my hand, though I had no say in the matter. It was starting. I was being consumed by the insidious intent that had cursed Cedric. That had forced him to kill his loved ones. And the very same murderous urge hauled me out of the front door in the early, unlit hours of the morning.

There lay a blade on the paved porch, and I bent forwards to scoop it up without a moment’s hesitation. Then I strolled across the grass towards my two loved ones. They lay in foetal bundles, like the cluster of living room cables. Neatly placed in the well-lit grass beside the ash tree’s shadow.

**3. Don’t walk in the shade of a backwards tree.**

As I raised the knife, preparing to lunge, I started to wrestle with the urge of the crawl. With that foreign motivation imprinted upon me. I knew I didn’t have to do this. Didn’t have to suffer a punishment for not obeying meaningless rules. Didn’t have to obey the rules at all, in fact.

*It’s weak*, I thought, eyeing the sickly bark of the tree.

And I recalled how fragile and vulnerable the tall crawl had seemed as a resting pile of black cables. Less intimidating than it had been in the hospital room.

*When I disobey, I weaken it*, I realised.

**3. Don’t walk in the shade of a backwards tree.**

That rule rang in my mind. I eyed the ash tree’s shadow, which was cast to the side of my two friends. Then I smiled, seeing what I believed to be a way forwards, before taking a well-meaning stride into the shade.

Dread knifed my heart, and a boiling liquid flooded my skull, enveloping me in fear beyond fear. I had willingly defied a rule. Willingly gone against the bidding of the crawl.

1. **Do whatever he bids, and do it twice if you doubt yourself.**

Two rules defied in one fell swoop.

However, that pull remained. That urge to do its bidding. I wasn’t cured.

There followed a sense of freedom, but it drowned in all-consuming terror. I’d felt triumphant upon seeing rot setting into the bark of the tree, but I was shrivelling as painfully as the crawl.

I screamed as my limbs started to snap into jagged, angular formations. I lost any remaining free will, and by the time I accepted that, I’d already lunged down. Already plunged the steel knife into Andreas’ chest.

Plunged again, again, and again.

My brother woke with a splutter, which somehow did not wake Holly, and blood filled his gaping mouth. I sobbed as I lay atop him. Sobbed as I felt the tree shift and creak above us.

“What have I done?” I cried.

“It came through the window,” Andreas whispered, shivering as he eyed the branches above us.

“Holly!” I yelled. “HELP!”

The police officer started to stir, opening her eyes with a shake, then she screamed at the sight of my brother. Screamed at the tree which started to twist and spiral into the dirt.

“I didn’t do it…” I promised, watery eyes begging her to believe me.

Holly knew. Much like Andreas, she’d seen and felt something. Something which contradicted all reason.

“Mum was here,” she whimpered, curling up into a tighter ball on the grass.

I’d never seen her so fragile.

“Holly?” I gently began.

“No…” she said to herself, shaking her head and changing her mind. “It wasn’t her.”

The ground quaked, swallowing the last of the thing pretending to be an ash tree. Swallowing me. Before I had a chance to do a thing, Andreas’ still-alive, though barely, form sank into the grass, joining the tree in some treacherous underworld. I clung to him, hoping to save him. Hoping to suffer with him, at the very least. But the blades of grass closed, sealing him away.

Holly and I dug for an hour, trying to reach him in a blind, traumatised panic, but he was gone.

I had not defeated the tall crawl. To starve it was only the beginning. For when I’d taken one step forwards, defying its law, I took two steps backwards. I fully succumbed to the will of the crawl.

“I murdered him,” I whispered to Holly as the sun dawned.

She shook her head and held me in her arms.

The months since that day have been torturous. I know there is a way out, but I don’t see it. Not yet. I try to remind myself of what I saw. That the tall crawl is not an impervious, omnipotent being, and it certainly does not prevent bad things from happening.

It *causes* them.

I keep telling myself I need the crawl to keep my loved ones safe, but I think my mind has twisted the truth.

1fvzvcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1fvzvcs/ice_queen/,Ice Queen,"It was a cloudy and freezing winter afternoon, many coats of snow covered the ground. Aimee has Raven Black hair and Amber eyes, she had free time and decided she wanted to go with some of her friends to a frozen pond not far from her house to skate, it tends to be a popular spot. Aimee drank coffee with pumpkin spice creamer to get ready for the cold. The night before she had a horrific nightmare. She saw kind of Ghost Princess or Evil Witch with a blue and white blade, she was backed into the corner of her room. The demon lady was pale as snow with very long black hair, could also be described as a vampire, Aimee wasn't sure. In her dream Aimee screamed as the Succubus came closer and paused with a smile before violently piercing her chest with the large sword, Aimee woke up screaming at that point. 

Aimee was the superstitious type, she thought her dreams meant something related to reality and believed they can tell things about the future. She felt frightened and couldn't get the images of the dream out of her mind. Aimee called Kyla and Samariah to go to that pond of ice and skate. They all met and walked to the pond. Dressed in winter clothing, they talked about regular old girl stuff. Aimee decided not to talk about her nightmare because she didnt want to ruin the mood. Kyla has mousey brown hair, Samariah is a pretty blonde. When they got to the pond they saw others skating as well. They put on their skates and were having fun. Aimee was doing spinning moves she has seen in figure skating, humorous dancing. They laughed and were having lots of fun. Samariah fell once and Kyla helped her up. After a while they got tired and went to sit by the side of the pond. 

They then noticed Lisa Anne, a girl they went to high school with years ago was there. Lisa Ann was the Queen Bee, typical high school mean girl. All 3 girls had a bad taste in the mouth. Lisa Anne always used to insult people about their apperance and spread rumors, both true and false. Aimee said ""well that is something I didn't want to see"", Kyla: ""Tell me about it"". They tried to continue with their ice skating despite the elephant in the room. Lisa Anne used a blade to cut a hole into the ice, no one really noticed her. Aimee went towards it and fell right in. She felt so cold and tried to rush up but was pushed back in to the water and she held her still into the dark water. Samariah and Kyla lost sight of her in the crowd. Lisa Anne smiled as Aimee struggled trying to reach the surface, after seconds she passed out and was sinking deeper.

Samariah: "" Where is Aimee ?"", Kyla didn't have an answer, little did she know Aimee's lifeless body was below her. Lisa Anne left the area. Samariah was extremely worried because Aimee was nowhere in sight, she told Kyla to come with her and go look for her. Kyla said she is probably fine, she just went to a resturaunt, Kyla: ""you know she has a sweet tooth, I am staying here, I'm tired"". Samariah ""Aimee wont pick up her phone, this might be serious"". Kyla: ""mabey she forgot it"". Samariah: ""she isn't the forgetful type"", she walked off to look for her. Kyla called someone on her phone, ""you did a great job, all went as planned"".",1,1728050461.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

It's Friday again and time for another Rotten Restaurant Report.  Hope that things have been well for all of you.  I like the fall.  Things seem to settle down and life goes a bit slower. But that doesn't mean our local inspectors get a break.  Here's what they've found....

The BEST -  These are the places that scored perfect 100s.  These places are really doing a good job at keeping their kitchens clean.  The places that score a perfect 100 are really going all out to do things right and they deserve your support.

The WORST SCORERS:  Now comes everyone's favorite part of the report - the list of Rotten Restaurants who scored worse than 85.  I don't post any place that scores 85 or above even if they were the worst inspections for a particular week.  85 is a solid B and I don't want to shame them.

Tacos El Nava (mob), Bend Score: 81 (9/17)

One Street Down Cafe, Redmond Score: 84 (9/16)

I'm going to stick these identifiers here so that when you see stuff like (mob) and (wh) you'll have some idea of what they are talking about.  I'm not positive about all of these but they're probably pretty close.  If you see anything I've missed or I guessed wrong please let me know.

e - fee exempt

mob - mobile

wh - warehouse

rp - recreational park

f - fixed position (a normal restaurant)

com - commissary

tf - traveler's accommodation

L - Limited Service

V - vending machines?

Still reserving judgement on the recipe, but I do find the concept of controlling extraction using immersion and temperature really interesting.

The funky part of the recipe is that you have to get the water from 90 to 93 deg C to about 70 deg C in between the 2nd and 3rd pours.    Kasuya does this by pouring cold water into the kettle to reduce the temperature.   I personally found this step kind of annoying and there isn't a lot of time between the 2nd and 3rd pours to get this done if you follow his recipe.

I found it easier to just decant hot water into another pitcher and just let it cool while doing the first two pours.   I use my [Hario air kettle](https://www.hario-usa.com/products/v60-drip-kettle-air) that I have for traveling.   It takes just under 3 minutes for a room temp air kettle to bring 93 deg water to 70 deg.   So if I pour right before I was wash the filter, it tends to work out.   I am guessing here but since the switch is closed when you pour this water, you might not need a gooseneck like pourer.

","I keep feeling so lost and my rejection-sensitive head is flitting about all over the place - I've tried talking to friends and journalling but in these moments of overwhelm I feel I need something - anything to help stop myself from collapsing in.

 (Therapy is needed - this I'm very sure of, but it's difficult to obtain when you work in the mental health services already and don't want an appointment with colleagues/ only over the phone, and ive not got the funds to start paying privately. I know psychotherapy with a focus on attachment would help, as would more information and support from the Neurodevelopmental services.. but Im in the UK.. Those waits aren't coming down any time soon!) 

I just feel pruned back by loss - my sense of self is unstable and most of my interpersonal relationships are gone. My 'pillars' of support feel like lopsided matchsticks and I'm teetering on the edge of losing it; whether that'll be into a state of complete self-caving or manic self sabotage (or both!) 

I'm not sure where to begin either - with him,  where the thoughts are creating an active cluster fuck in my head of what I actually want, or context of everything happening up to the event. No idea - even trying to write it out it's all brunching up in my head together with timeliness and reactions from it all, I feel all the context and background is important - but so's explaining the current state. 

The Year Before the Break Up;

- Grandmother dies in freak accident after choking on a sausage, days before mother's day.   Family relationships are already stupidly complicated - enough to fill another post. 

-Best Friend of ten years decides to buy a house and move out with new boyfriend, leaving me with less than a months notice and nearly losing my tenancy,  who then proceeds to bad mouth me to everyone and everyone - to the point where I can't go out anywhere socially without strangers even coming up to talk to me about it as they'd heard all this stuff from her. I've not heard a word from her since. 

- Demoted at work due to lack of funding and sent back to an old job which had caused a lot of mental distress in the last. I'd been told previously that all the additional work I'd been doing above my banding would be recognised (spoiler alert - it wasn't) 

-Breast Cancer scare (biopsy luckily came back okay) 

- Blood Cancer Scare ( still testing - should be okay) 

- Replacement Housemate moves out after six months, nearly lost house again, end up helping out a friend who's breaking up with her boyfriend, giving him a place to stay. Ex boyfriend is Schizophrenic and not properly medicated - sometimes proves for more uncomfortable/unsettling living. 

During all this, and waayy back before when we'd gotten back together after splitting up (I'd ended things before as after three years of ""dating"" we weren't a proper couple at all, he'd kept me as a secret from his friends and family and housemates, we didn't have an anniversary, never went on dates, it had taken YEARS to get to the point where he could find the time for us to even spend a whole day together... It wasn't a good relationship) we'd gotten back together after he'd written all these heartfelt beautiful letters taking ownership of all his mistakes and indifference, with all these plans and promises of how he wanted us to be together.. Marriage, kids, the lot.  All these plans of us moving in and living together... How he wanted me to go to him as the first person for any future plans for moving and who'd I'd live with.  And stupidly, I believed him. 

I wanted to believe that my best friend of 15 years was finally in the same position I was in, wanted the same things and future I did. I wanted to believe that all the things I'd confided in him could actually come true, that all those years before of being put aside would finally be over. Tip -  You can't ever trust a salesman.

We'd gotten back together and things had been better, he'd introduced me to friends and family, we'd been on a few dates, starting scheduling more time together - things had seemed good. 

After the initial moving out fiasco I'd mentioned moving in together with him, following through on all those previous promises. He'd fill me with platitudes about how nice that would be,how it would make sense as his friends and family were all based near me, but skirted around the topic if I tried pressing any further or getting specifics. 

When it'd been hitting crunch time and I was struggling with finding a replacement housemate ( before my friend's ex moved in), losing my tenancy was looming, I'd asked him again, and when he tried giving platitudes saying maybe Summer or later, I told him to go away and really think about it, and come back to me with an answer. 

Valentines Day comes around and I'm planning a silly sexy surprise for him (sexy Kermit - based off an in-joke between us),  I'm thinking everything is okay and good between us - we're finally going to start going somewhere.  That's when he drops the bomb - he doesn't want to move in together, what he actually wants to do is travel to Africa for six months to lose weight and write a book. 

He'd bought some land out there so he could do some trading/buy stocks and now wanted to live off it cheaply as he'd been saving up thousands and thousands and wanted a break from work for a while.

... 

Unsurprisingly, our relationship took a setback from there. He was still telling me that he loved me, had never met anyone like me, had the connection we had and had pictured a future together.  To protect myself I'd initiated an intimate distance, no physical touch apart from a hug hello/goodbye - no cuddles or kissing or sleeping by one another. We were still talking, trying to find a resolve between us. 

For me I didn't want to get in the way of what he needed for himself, a break from work and family responsibilities and pressures - six months would pass either way, if he'd really meant what he'd said about us and the future - who was I to get in the way of it?    He'd been talking to me for hours about the future he'd seen for us, how we'd live together, marriage - kids and how many, even names he'd picked out for them. Told me about how he'd even gone and gotten his sperm tested so he'd know if he was fertile so we wouldn't have that problem down the line. 

My 30th birthday occurs and it's a bit of a shit show; my narcissistic mother makes no plans with me or any family even when I'd asked her to let me know if she was free so we could do something. She appears on my doorstep for a minute before scarpering away as quickly as possible - only to get a message from my Aunt a week later saying how my mother had been so upset I'd not invited her out for coffee.. as she'd paid for parking! Sister following suit had booked herself in for an extra gig to pay off her newly bought PS5 so she was busy all day, even when I asked if she'd be there or at least the next day as it meant a lot to me, she just ignored this and I didn't hear from any other family until I got a scathing message from my aunt.  

During drunken celebrations (not wise I know), we'd kissed and spent the night together, and for the following weeks we were acting as a couple again. I thought things were more resolved and we were moving forward. We'd talked compromise to him spending six months away, how we could work together during and when he got back. Over a month passes and no problems, he moves out of his house and comes to stay with me before getting ready for his trip. (rent and bill free). 
 
I take time off work so we can have some quality time doing things together before he goes away, try making plans for dates so we can have memories for whilst he's gone etc. Etc.   More platitudes arise whenever I try make plans and nothing happens, the week slips by and we do nothing.  I go back to work and a few days later I come home from a long day... He breaks up with me. 

His reasoning is that he doesn't want to hurt me, mess me around and even though he knows I'm right for him and can picture all this future together, it's not fair to me to keep messing me around like this. He's making himself out to be a martyr when all he's been is a silver tongued sychophant who has used me and my heart for years and years and years.   I don't think he ever did love me, just liked how easy to was to get what he wanted and needed from me because I was so blinded. You wouldn't treat someone that way if you loved them. You say those things to protect your self identity instead of admitting that you've used and led someone on for years, that you care that little for them after your own self interest.


I am angry, and hurting. I know I'm only feeling that way because feelings are still there and I want myself to be rid of them, of him - I'm just struggling with even more loss and again knowing I'm not wanted by anyone. He came back to the country recently to officiate his friends wedding (ironic I know) which has stirred up all this extra bleuugh and I'm just struggling with it all.

Thank you for reading and sorry for the length /pointlessness of this post, I've been writing for hours and I'm not feeling any better but at least a lot of it's all out in one place.

1fvzgc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1fvzgc0/mission_complete_small_writeup_of_my_thoughts/,Mission Complete! Small write-up of my thoughts ,"I've played around 70 hours about 1,5 years ago during Update 8 Beta, where I finished phase 3 and then quit. I started a new save when 1.0 released. It took me 80 hours on the new save to finish, and another 5 hours to full achievement completion, outputting a steady 15 Ballistic Warp Devices per minute by the end. My factories are entirely functional. Decently organized, but I didn't really do any decoration or aesthetics. My enjoyment lies in forward progress, rather than building pretty things. Given how much I played since release, it's needless to say that I liked the game, and I hope I don't sound overly negative by not reiterating all the good things that people say about the game. I play without mods and judge the experience by how the developers intended it.

Things I wished I knew/did earlier:

* While using the jetpack, tapping jump rapidly gives more height than holding down. Combined with a conveyor boosted long jump, you can cover a similar distance of that of a small hypertube cannon.
* Binding conveyors, power lines and ladders to the side keys of my mouse
* Swapping Q and N hotkeys. It's much faster to just type what I want rather than navigating the menu
* Holding CTRL when nudging nudges by half a space only. Most of the time.
* When building manyfold, instead of building junctions first and then connecting them, build a straight line of conveyor/pipeline and then put the junctions on top of them. It might sound small, but it saves a lot of time and fininicking in the long run.
* Exploring by hoverpack and building poles en route is way, way more efficient than exploring with the jetpack.

Things I didn't like:

* Building is too finnicky. I think most of us want to build things aligned 90% of the time, yet the alignment snapping is quite weak. Too much of my building time is spent with lot of nudging and finnicky aligning things. Blueprints don't snap together and it's tiring to always manually connect conveyors between blueprint modules. No vertical nudging means a lot of time building is: Build support structure, snap what you want to build to support structure, delete support structure. Elevators snapped / combined with Splitters/Mergers cannot be build back in the same way after being deleted.
* Hoverpack intertia. I guess it adds some realism, but it's incredibly annoying for building.
* Fluids are unnecessarily complicated and confusing. I've finished the game now and I still cannot retrace most of the time why there is always so much fluctuation in my throughput. Might be a me problem though.
* A few select alternate recipes are extremely useful, while 95% were, for me, completely useless.

Things I would have liked to have:

* Map markers for where i slotted in Somersloops. I know it's on me, but I've ran around my factories more than once to look for where I put them
* Late game structure that displays all production. I think running around and troubleshooting through manual investigation is part of the fun, but it would be a very satisfying late game milestone to have a more efficient method.
* Limiting size of Storage Containers. I oftentimes just want a small buffer for one item and not keep the machines producing 1000s of it.
* Some way to mass upgrade conveyors. Going to an old factory module and upgrading the belts inside and int he periphery is really boring, but it's usually still way faster than building a new factory. Extra fun you later realize you forgot a small piece somewhere.

Things I did that worked out well for me:

* Every production unit up to Blenders has a 4x4 blueprint that manifold to at least two units and stacks  and aligns vertically. Meaning if I need higher capacity, I can just plop the same blueprint on top of the first one, connect power, conveyors and set recipes and I'm done. No need to manually build mergers and splitters.
* Everything that is not an enclosed production cycle happens in my main base in the sky. The 4x4 towers keep everything well organized. There are two floors below my base for logistics that feed and receive from the towers through elevators. If a new production requires an item, I just go on floor two, split off an existing conveyor for that item and feed it into the elevator below the tower.  I also have two double rows of containers where I keep a storage of every relevant item up to phase 3. While all of this took some time to think and set up, having all items well organized in a centralized place eliminated a lot of plaguing issues I had on my first playthrough.
* I only have two types of drone ports, servers and clients. Servers are depots of a resource and have no drone. Clients are always in a set of at least two with the first one always fetching batteries from the battery server, and the other ports fetching the target resource. The only drone ports that have in- and outgoing materials are the ones that deal with liquids and gases, with (un)packaging modules right next to them. I guess this is the most standard arrangement, but I was still pleased with myself how smooth it worked from the get go.
* Strictly adhering to blueprints. Whenever I feel like I might be building something more than once, I will build it in the Designer rather than on site. Updating existing blueprints with improvements is always worth it.
* Multiple blueprints of hypertube cannons of varying lengths and angles. I place them liberally at every small outpost and I never really had to run anywhere from midgame onwards.

I think it got a bit repetitive in the later stages, but enjoyed the game overall. Then again, I think I didn't benefit from a lot of cool stuff that is in the game as I am not a sandbox player. Unfortunately I often found it hard to combine efficiency with satisfaction. Making things neat and pretty takes a, for me, unreasonable amount of time. I often had to settle for ugly solutions to problems, simply because a neat way to do it would require investment of time and nerve for no benefit whatsoever outside of a better aesthetic. More QOL in building would have gone a long way to making my experience better. That being said, I shudder when I imagine the complexity of developing a game this complex with so many intricate systems, and how hard it must be to compromise between new features and refactoring old ones. I can imagine it's easy to underestimate how much work even small improvements are to implement.

A big thanks and hats off to Coffee Stain Studios for making an outstanding game.",1,1728049341.0,SatisfactoryGame,2,1.0,False

This story needs a tiny bit of context. 

I am someone who does freelance on the side. One of those services is website building and designing. I met this guy, lets call him Bill, at a coffee shop in my town. We got to talking and it turns out he actually is the owner of a construction business. He asked me if i would ever consider helping him out and i agreed. 

I then spent 2 months creating a website, strategizing his marketing plan, and establishing his business presence. all without payment. I did mock up a contract that he signed. 

  
On the 25th, i finally handed everything off to him and told him it was a pleasure to work with him. As well as mentioning that my invoice was in his email.

  
He then tells me he will pay it ""sometime in the next 15 days"". 

  
Even though thats not something we agreed on, i decided that since he was my first freelance client, that i'd give him some room to pay me. 

Well, payment was due 10 days ago and i havent heard a single thing from him since i gave him the website and all the credential to his google admins and such. 

  
Im wondering what to do because:

-I charged him a significantly lower price because he was my first client and he owns a small business in town so i didnt want to charge him the ""nyc"" prices im used to hearing about (im from new york and have been working there my whole life""

-Our contract states he has to pay me when services are rendered, which they were.

-I need this money? lol. $1500 for the amount of work i put in is low, but the amount itself is not. I was structuring my payment around things i really needed.



I was thinking about messaging him again on Imessage but my partner told me to write here and get some advice. 

  
Let me know what you think!

Mostly my side effects the past few weeks has been lots of vomiting. I'm unable to eat/drink anything super acidic, minty, or spicy. I feel full quicker than I used to and I can't seem to keep coffee or juice down in larger quantities. Sometimes not even a sip of coffee/juice on a bad day.

Or at least someone who doesn’t press snooze 100 times.,"I have never been a morning person. I press snooze a thousand times. It’s one of the reasons I’ve realized I need to live alone. I can’t subject someone else to my incessant alarms. 

I’ve tried everything. I keep caffeine gummies next to my bed. Alarms where I have to actually get up and move. Keeping a constant routine. Sunrise alarms didn’t really work but I got strip lights in my room that go off about 30 minutes before my alarm. 

My current alarm routine goes like this: Automatic coffee maker on my desk goes off at 5:00, 5:15 first alarm goes off, 5:30 lights go on, 5:45 another alarm, then 6:00 alarm to get out of bed. 

I’d like to get out of bed around 5:30. 6:00 is when I could get out of bed and still have enough time for everything. But recently I’ve been rolling out of bed at like 6:20. I hate rushing so it just puts me in a bad mood.

I struggle to sleep so I usually take a sleep aid around 9/9:30. Sometimes they work sometimes they don’t. To keep myself from getting too upset over my sleep issues I aim to be asleep by midnight. 

Nothing works. It may work for a week, then I go back to just sleeping until I absolutely have to get up. I’ve been getting healthier with my diet and exercise. My diet follows my menstrual cycle to help balance my hormones. It’s a work in progress but it has been helping.

Now, I have a job with an inconsistent and relatively long commute. That’s the joy of driving in Baltimore lol. I’ll have consistent insurance and I’m hoping to go to a doctor to deal with sleep issues and other mental health issues. But that won’t be until next year if anything comes from it.

It’s like my brain doesn’t work in the morning. My brain is yelling at me to wake up and get ready but my body doesn’t listen. My brain and body will not work until it’s too late to do anything. No positive or negative stimuli will motivate me. All I want to do is sleep.

1fvzarv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderDrones_Fanfics/comments/1fvzarv/parabellum_chapter_ii_continued/,"Parabellum, Chapter II (Continued)","Uzi stared at herself in the mirror, shakily brushing away some strands of dull purple that had fallen into her face. *Christ, she looked like hell.* There were visible bags under her dimmed neon purple optics, her hair was frizzy and in dire need of brushing from having a hood draped over it for so long—and her arms trembled slightly. Her striped sweater had traces of dried blood along the sleeve even though she was sure her overcoat had covered everything. The corpse she had left behind—unceremoniously shoved in a stolen Mercedes sedan trunk—flashed non-stop in her mind like a cassette on repeat. The very moment she had walked into her apartment, she threw off her overcoat that had her pistol safely stashed away as if someone had slipped molten iron inside, leaving it on the cold floor. The high-rise apartment complex itself was a physical asset owned by Don Rossi’s real estate firm, but just behind the curtain was an intricate money laundering scheme that had gone on for years without a hitch. For three years, millions upon millions of dollars flowed into the pockets of the *consiglieri*, the mafia proper, and the Don himself. Being a made member of the mob, Uzi was given “special treatment” by the firm—essentially free living, something the teen certainly wasn't complaining about, especially at a time like this. The police no doubt had recovered the remains of Oliver Mackenzie—the only abhorrent piece of evidence she had left behind—but Uzi couldn't bring herself to turn on the TV. When she reached for the remote—or tried to—her arm would not move even slightly. Those shot-out eyes seared themselves into her thoughts, and the nineteen-year-old drone’s synthetic stomach lurched with every shaky breath she drew. She had done it so *carelessly*, so *effortlessly* just an hour ago—left the body in the stolen sedan and made off like she had just departed a taxi—and now here she was, shaking like a leaf in autumn. Her hands trembled with a relentless force even as she gripped the porcelain sink, her legs as weak as an old lady's. Her heart pounded against her chest with all of the force of an automatic rifle—halfly from adrenaline, and half from the constant feeling of being *watched.* Uzi knew that she was the only one in her small apartment, but even looking away from the bathroom mirror made all of the hairs on her body stand on end. She squeezed her optics shut and ground her teeth—trying, *trying* to wrest away those reddish black holes where two sea-blue orbs once laid—yet it clung to her like a leech that refused to let go of its host. Her gaze once again floated back to the mirror, and her optics hollowed in *fear* and resentment. She so badly wanted to punch the mirror with all of the strength she still had in her trembling arms—to scream at it to stop displaying her—but her grip only tightened on the gleaming white bathroom sink, as if some intangible entity had nailed her hands to the porcelain without her knowledge. She had stopped feeling the cold tiles long ago, only wishing for it to open up and swallow her whole—she wouldn't object to it. Sure, she had killed before—but never like this. It had always been a single shot. A clean—scarily accurate hit that would ensure minimal suffering—if at all. Why was this so different? Why was it so—so *brutal*? Uzi could barely reconcile herself with the woman that had committed such an *obscene*, *animalistic* act merely an hour or two ago. Her frame began to shake again—this time much more violently than before, and the teenage drone felt like an airtight bag had been yanked over her head and zipped tight. Uzi’s arms flew to her head, her hands grabbing tufts of her dull purple locks—yanking it as hard as she could, as she was a mountain climber hanging onto a rope for dear life after slipping. The guttural scream that should've ripped through her throat was instead blocked up, creating a burning sensation akin to that of taking a swig of whiskey—but the burn didn't last for a fleeting second. She once again squeezed her optics shut, stumbling out of the bathroom—but even in the darkness, all she could see were those eyes—as blue as the Pacific Ocean—widening for the final time as they stared down the very last thing they'd ever see—a suppressor. A jolt of pain made Uzi's optics snap open as the back of her foot made contact with the drawers under her bed—causing the teen to fall back and onto the mattress.        
But even the embrace of the soft, plush material did little to calm the storm raging in her. Tears began to flow down, the sheer number of which akin to the constant downpour just outside. She curled into herself, bringing her knees up to her chest—the cold Seattle wind that always happened to be infused with the earthy smell of rain flowing over her, softly whistling—*mocking* her pitiful state. Sobs wracked her body, but even then the memories were ceaseless. The rain began to get louder, along with the constant thrum of her heart in her auditory receptors. Every rustle of the blanket was amplified tenfold—but the constant hammering of the rain overpowered all but the rapid fire of her heart. At the blare of a far-away ferry horn that sounded like it had barked right in front of her, she shot up in a cold sweat, like she had been hit full-blast with a water shotgun after sleeping in the scorching desert sands of the Sahara for months—tears still rolling down her visor and burning her optics like the relentless African sun. Uzi wanted to scream—she wanted to dig her nails into her casing and tear it off, piece by agonizing piece—to curl up into the fetal position and… She wasn't sure what else. With every move, she couldn't stop shaking—every inch forward carrying the crushing weight of what she had just done. It was so *unlike* her to do something so *cruel*. She never made anyone suffer unnecessarily—and yet, she just did. She created fear, and she **reveled** in it. *Why?* The question rained down on her unraveling mind like a jury casting accusations, and yet the answer itself eluded her. But what disgusted—*repulsed* Uzi the most is that she **enjoyed it**. The feeling of control, it was like lightning upon a live wire. It made her feel *alive* in the most sickening way. Maybe she just wanted to get it over with. Maybe she was mad. Mad at something, *anything*. The rain still ceaselessly *pitter-pattered* outside, and Uzi shakily turned her head to the open window to her right, where the cold air danced from the outside world to the inside of Uzi's apartment. She gazed out to the city with hollowed, red-rimmed and haunted optics—and was met with the usual blinding neon lights that seemed to infect every inch of the city, the bark of car horns in the distance, sprawling skyscrapers that seemed to reach the heavens and reduce the labyrinth on ground level to mere ants, along with the acrid smell of car exhaust mixing with the earthy aroma of the rain, algae, and ocean water from the close-by Lake Washington. Along with that concoction of smell, the bittersweet scent of coffee that seemed to cover the whole city at times wafted into the apartment, a more than welcome undertone. To the left of her was a campus that always looked like it had just been snatched right out of time itself—the sprawling labyrinth of the University of Washington, where she was currently studying. Further beyond that was the now-quiet Husky Stadiums, covered in colored fallen leaves, blown in by the chilly November wind and most definitely soaked with rainwater. Even after all of these centuries—in 3071—it still hadn't changed a bit. The architecture of its many units and departments still retained its Victorian-era exterior; only enlarged and fitted with a renovated interior to fit present needs, but it still held that grand old man mystique amidst the neon lights and 4D billboards of the city. It always teemed with activity—always at least one or two lights on throughout the night. The windowsill was slick with rainwater, small puddles gleaming in the moonlight—reflecting the overcast Seattle skyline. The upper part of the window was blurred by the trillions of droplets landing on it every couple seconds, leaving it a distorted mess of outlines and piercing city lights—so bright, yet so dim and out of reach.         

Occasionally, a raindrop would slip in and land with a soft *plip*, making the drone jolt slightly. All the same, the scenery served to comfort her. The rolling gray clouds above that seemed to pour out tiny droplets of water non-stop were oddly relaxing—as if it was sucking up all of Uzi's darkest urges and carrying it far away, but dropping tiny, microscopic fragments of them along the way as cruel reminders of what she had just done. For a moment, she finally got rid of those eyes, those thin ribbons of veins that laid exposed along with the gushing crimson that seemed to never stop after she pulled the trigger. For a moment, she finally felt *free* after what seemed like a lifetime’s worth of torment. If only that really were the case. The opening chords of the instrumental version of *Everlong* plucked her back into reality, and nearly made her jump out of her own casing. With it, a large transparent neon-purple-outlined rectangle obstructed her vision.    

**INCOMING VOICE CALL.**  There was no name—or no name Uzi could see, as she was currently tunnel visioning on the purple-colored words that were quite literally in her face. She let the call ring for a moment, absentmindedly swaying her head back and forth to the distorted riffs and drums that hammered its way into her skull, her knees once more drawn to her chest as she relentlessly fought to push away the imagery that made her heart drop into her synthetic stomach. *Drip*. Uzi was once again plucked from her music-induced trance by the sound of a raindrop, and she scrambled to answer the call before it faded from her sight. There was no encryption software Uzi had implemented—after all, who would think such a seemingly average, introverted, awkward college student would be a mobster for one of the most influential crime families in not only Seattle, but in all of the *fifty states*? But now, that was most certainly a possibility in her eyes. She cleared her throat, and shakily answered the call. Had she slipped up somehow? Had they finally caught up to her? But she had done everything right, and used her *MASK* software, perfectly evading law enforcement without a single… *Major* hitch. Surely they wouldn’t know—*right?* ‘*Please don’t let it be who I think it is…*’

  There was a silence that seemed to stretch on and on for millennia, even though Uzi was sure it was only for a couple seconds. Questions raced through her mind at an impossible speed. *Should she speak up?* She held her tongue, nervously flicking her sweater zipper.

“Hey, ‘zi!” She was greeted with a chipper voice that broke through the tension and made her heart skip two beats, and Uzi exhaled a relieved breath she didn't even know she was holding in. She stuttered and tripped over her words, trying to formulate a coherent response and failing miserably each time. Her dark purple laptop lay on the foot of the bed—half-opened—but the display was completely black. Most likely dead. Uzi inwardly facepalmed. Before she left, she had forgotten to charge it—and she had a couple papers due. *‘Shit, shit, shit.*’ “Uzi, ya there?” She was once again taken out of her thoughts. “Y-yeah.” She managed to splutter out. Her gaze fixed on her laptop as yet another wave of worry came at her with the force of a square wave. The youthful voice on the other end was Gryffin, her childhood friend—and longtime crush. 

   He was also V’s brother.

   “You sound… *off*. You alright?” His voice took on a softer, more warm tone. He was known for being one of the nicest guys on campus—far too nice for this world. He never got into fights—and rarely raised his voice at all. Most of all he was blissfully oblivious to his sister's actual life, in spite of her more-than-well-off lifestyle. Uzi herself was completely out of the question—due to her seemingly unremarkable life, certainly not befitting of a mobster. Not that Gryffin hadn't gotten suspicious about the couple hundred dollars thrown at him whenever he was in need—but V was an expert liar, and the one Uzi had picked up her own silver tongue from. She always had some believable story to weave seemingly from thin air, and Uzi admired her for that. 

  But even the best liars slip up.

  “I'm fine. Just… Tired.” She replied, after yet another bout of stuttering. Her heart fluttered when she heard him lightly chuckle in response, in spite of it currently beating faster than a Chiron on a good day. He always managed to find humor in everything—everything he reasonably could.

“I thought I'd never see the day you'd run out of energy. Guess the non-stop work’s finally caught up, huh, *Miss* *Workaholic*?” Uzi willed Gryffin to get to the point—her visor flushing in spite of the mental whirlpool she was currently fighting off. She tugged at her sweater, trying not to look at the small smear of crusted dried blood that streaked across the black and white stripes. “You left so suddenly. Did something happen?” Uzi's oil ran cold in her veins. Instead of an airtight alibi that was stitched together in mere microseconds—Uzi’s only response was silence. 

She had taken off while they were working on a humanities assignment with their other friends that couldn’t have picked a worse time to be assigned. In hindsight, Uzi was lucky that she had gotten that text when she did—she would've ended up saying something she'd probably deeply regret if she had been there a second longer. Against her better judgment, she eyed the small dried bloodstain that she could never escape seeing, trying to swim against the ever-growing, ever-present current of fear that kept the words—the silk to which the web was spun—stuck in her throat. The whistling wind beat against the glass of the window, pelting fat raindrops farther into the apartment, as if to try to shake her out of her woolgathering. Uzi silently wished—prayed—that this ever-turning world would slow its pace, if only for a second. While it spun, and spun, and spun without cease—she was miles behind—trying to hastily pick up the pieces and join it, only to do it all again.

   But time—the cruel mistress—would not heed her plea. Her optics began to drift once more, and she found herself aimlessly staring into space. Perhaps Uzi *wasn't* the same person—perhaps she had been transferred to another body, forced to watch whoever she now inhabited kill a man for simply doing his job in the most inhumane way. Maybe she'd wake up to the cold bristle of the wind, the constant chill of the now-moistened cardboard box she had curled herself into dampening her clothing and seeping into her casing—and the constant pang of hunger in the pit of her stomach. Maybe she'd be seven again—roaming the alleyways of Wallingford in soaked, torn rags that barely kept her warm. Her optic slightly glitched at the memories, and she winced. Did she *really* want to go back to that life? 

  “Er… Yeah, something like that,” She managed to mumble, her trembling fingers threading through her dull purple hair. It still stung—having to lie to him non-stop like this, even if it was a half-lie. Every word that fell from Uzi’s tongue felt as heavy as an anvil and as acrid as cyanide, and she felt a constant ping in her stomach that spread up her back in a matter of seconds. But at the same time, the teenage drone couldn’t bring herself to even think about what would happen if she told him the actual truth. Her optics flitted between the overcoat that she had hastily discarded near her apartment door, and the blurred window. The grip of her suppressed *M9* peeked out of the inner pocket, the outer steel gleaming in the pale autumn moonlight while the leather, in contrast, only offered a dull shine. Everywhere she turned, she was reminded of what she had just done, as if some vengeful spirit of days past decided to go out of its way to make her life more of a living Hell than it already was. Her mouth twitched at the sight, her optics hollowing—and the words once again entangled themselves within her voice box. The follow-up was there, yes, but it felt too flimsy. “I—” She stopped herself, and once again began to fidget with her sweater sleeve. ‘*Keep it together. Keep it together.*’ She told herself, swallowing hard. She had lost track of how many times she had repeated it to herself already, as if it was the only source of comfort in a world that wouldn't stop taking from someone that already had no more to give. She wished, pleaded that the words would finally come out—that she'd be rid of this deafening silence that made her auditory receptors ring as if she had just stepped out of a metal concert—but the words remained stuck to her synthetic vocal chords. “Uzi, talk to me. Something's wrong. You're normally not this quiet. Did something happen?” The already stuck-up words had now forced themselves into her voice box and out of her memory. “I can hear your breathing. Are you hurt?” Her breath caught in her synthetic windpipe. She held her breath as if she was a diver that had gone too deep in the Mariana, her hollowed optics darting around as if she was looking for some unseen threat. Panic seized her before she could even properly process what was going on, and she froze—not daring to even utter a word. Then the words came out faster than she could catch them. “N-no, of course not,” She spluttered, her words laced with anxiety instead of the usual monotone angst, something she tried her damn hardest to cover up. The words themselves spilled out like word-vomit, but he somehow caught each one. “I'm just a bit paranoid about a couple other projects I have due.” She nervously laughed in spite of the pang of guilt that spread throughout her skull like pain, and subsequently mentally berated herself for telling the single-most unconvincing lie she had ever told in her nineteen years of existence. ‘*That could've gone* ***so*** *much better. Goddamn it, Uzi! You can do better than this!*’ 

  She mentally shook herself, a vain attempt to gather her scattered thoughts, which were like files that fell from an overturned cabinet. She was supposed to be mysterious, unflappable—yet here she was, falling apart at the seams just by the sound of her crush's infectious voice. She was probably just being delusional, there was no way in Hell he'd be into someone like *her*. Maybe she needed to get more sleep. Uzi once again mentally slapped herself with such force she felt the sting of the hit. It was a pathetic thought to think Gryfiin would hold an iota of romantic interest in her, yet that fuzzy, almost calming warmth that came with hearing his voice would not fade, as much as she tried to suffocate it—much to the drone's dismay. Instead, it began to spread throughout her body—sending shiver after shiver down her spine. “I- I also had to run a couple errands. It was getting late either way, so…” She once again trailed off, the words leaving her mind. Yet another semi-fabrication. It was true, she had to run due to it getting late, and because he lived in Golden Dragon Triad territory. Just weeks earlier, J had gotten into a bare-knuckle fight with an enforcer during an arms deal gone wrong and ended up beating the bastard into a pulp, so anyone polishing Rossi’s boots with their saliva wasn't exactly welcomed with open arms there. It was also true that she was pinged to run an “*errand*” that ended in one brutal death that would more than likely end up on the Seattle Sentinel front page for the week. Wait a minute… *Eureka.*

   “And after I saw the news; it…” She audibly, yet shakily exhaled for extra emphasis. The guilt in the pit of her stomach subsequently transformed into nausea, and bile crawled up her throat from what she had just done. She had just added a gallon of gasoline to an already raging fire she could barely contain, much less put out. Uzi’s head slowly sank into her hands, tears brimming and stinging her optics—but not yet falling down, staying in its place like a branding iron being pressed against skin. She shook her head against her palms, forcing down the rising bile and steeling herself, just as she had done many times before. She heard Gryffin hiss on the other end. “Yeah, it creeped me out too. Can't believe someone would do that.” Uzi recoiled as if she had been punched directly in the gut, her breath hitching as she began to once more fiercely fight against the incoming wave of scarlet and exposed vein that seared itself into her memory as the call settled into an awkward silence. If only he knew that she was the monster that had been behind something so *vile*, so inhumane, and yet here she was—hiding behind half-truths like a coward. Her hands clutched at her head, trembling like brittle leaves in a thunderstorm. She wanted to scream—scream until her vocal chords gave out, plead to whatever deity that wouldn’t let her rest to forgive her and make it stop until it would finally be cleared from her mind. It only worsened as she squeezed her optics shut, only becoming increasingly more vivid—more *detailed*. It was J’s fault for getting Oliver so close, why’d *Uzi* have to be the one to do it? Why had she agreed to track him down? But it wasn't like she had anything better to do at the moment, and if memory served, J’s hands were quite literally tied at that moment—courtesy of the Triads for beating one of theirs to an oily pulp. Either way, Uzi was aching to escape the endless flood of academia, textbooks, and never-ending studying. But this was *so* not how she wanted to end her night. ‘*Stupid, stupid, stupid!*’ Her fists clenched, grabbing tufts of her unkempt dull purple locks, and she began to pull—a dull burning sensation crawling throughout her scalp with each tug. Her racing mind returned to the saint that she waved back and forth just close to three years ago, her oil bubbling within the crackling orangish-blue flame that looked like the sky when the sun’s first rays peeked out of the darkness of the night as she took the oath that solidified her as judge, jury, and executioner. Except this was anything but that. She was in a lifelong debt to her father; to Aurelio Rossi, for saving her life when the federal government *wouldn’t*, and this was how she’d repay the favor. ‘*This was necessary, wasn’t it? I had to do this.*’ “I need to get some sleep. Talk to you tomorrow?” She muttered, trying to keep her voice steady. Uzi knew there was no way she’d be getting even a millisecond of sleep even if she chanted that mantra to herself a thousand times over, but she needed something—*anything* to break the long silence that made her already scattered thoughts become more and more outlandish. “Yeah, that’s fine. Just wanted to check up on you. See you tomorrow, ‘zi. Be safe” He said, his voice tinged with comfort that reeked of pity.    Before the teen could return the gesture, the line cut, and there was silence.   Uzi tossed and turned as minutes stretched into what seemed like whole lifetimes, her optics wide open and hollowed out—the thick blanket draped over her frame not doing nearly enough to keep her warm as she began to quiver and shake, pixelated sweat pouring down her visor as the teen let out a barely audible whimper. The memories once again pounced upon her like a beast from the shadows, who patiently waited for its prey to come out of hiding and stumble into its hunting grounds. Now it was just the encroaching darkness, the pale half-moon that hung high above the overcast Seattle sky, the whistling wind that subtly blew strands of her hair to and fro, and the pelting rain to keep her company. Her gaze once again drifted to the discarded overcoat on the cold hardwood floor, right next to the plush silver fur carpet. The sweater she wore felt like it was pressing into her casing—suffocating her the more she looked at the overcoat, yet her optics would not move from it as her CPU raced between college life and the one that she kept close to her chest like a poker player would keep his cards.

I have been bf's with Jane since we were teens, she'd been with John, for a few years. We're having a get together, a few friends. I was leaning over to grab my drink and John got up behind me and started thrusting his groin against me and shoving me across the room everyone was laughing. The problem was, that I found it slightly arousing but kept it as just a joke. Over the next few weeks I found myself thinking of it and I couldn't help it creeping in. One night I had gone to see Jane, John was working late so it was just us two , John came home and he joined us for a coffee and it was getting late so John said ""I can drive you home if you like, it's only 20 minutes"" We were chatting and all of a sudden someone pulled out quickly in front of us and as he put the breaks on, he threw his arm across my chest, I was wearing my seatbelt he had a handful of my chest, in hand and it was there for 20 seconds roughly, neither of us saw this as an opportunity to cup a feel or be inappropriate, just safety. We pulled up outside my house and as always I leaned to give my friend a kiss on the cheek to say goodnight but he turned to speak as I leaned in and our lips met, we both laughed at that and I got out the car and walked to the porch and turned to wave goodbye. I couldn't help but think about all the physical times, if they were hints or if I was over thinking things and being inappropriate. It progressed to being more physical. I haven't mentioned a partner of my own in any of this so far which I am aware of, I did have a partner whom I was with, until we separated but then, I met Steve and I was smitten. Years passed and it was still going on. Jane said that they would be moving due to John's work and to a different state, I was upset, Jane and I was worried that we would grow apart, I also realised that meant I couldn't with John either. The time came and they moved and we made plans to see one another as much as possible, Jane suggested I come stay the weekend. A few years of this and John's work made it so that they could move back to our home state but 2 towns over, we were ecstatic. A few years have passed and myself and John are still very much invested in our affair and our partners do not suspect a thing either. The part I guess I am most ashamed of is that after 10 years John asked me a question one night we had some time together, he said ""after all this time, do you not feel guilty to Jane? She has been your best friend for a very long time yet you're with me"" and this took me by surprise because it made me think, then I said ""well what she doesn't know, can't hurt her can it"" and I felt like I had hurt my own heart, saying those words, he just shrugged and said ""well that's fair to say, I agree"" . I hadn't thought of that until just recently 5 years later. There's much more but a 3,000 letter limit. So I cut it short.",1,1728048817.0,AITAH,6,0.99,False

Now some or maybe a lot of you will not understand me or my pain and will say accidents happen, the ""same"" thing could have happened to you, there is nothing you can do about it now and you should not put anymore pressure on yourself or your loved one since it was not intended and everyone feels bad as is. All that is true and rationally speaking I agree and yet I am struggling to get over the accident my baby boy had yesterday and to find a way to forgive myself and my husband.


My baby boy is a mere 13 months old and recently got his beautiful top teeth. Now he had 4 teeth in total, 2 on the top 2 on the bottom. He had this little gap between his teeth and I started to wonder how he would look when he got older.:) Would he have a little gap like my mom or would the other teeth push them into place? Aw and how his character slighlty changed with his beautiful gapped tooth smile, simply adorable. My heart would melt every time he would lie in my arms at night, with his head slightly bent back so his mouth would open and he would smile in his dreams and his two little white pearls would grin back at me. An image I will always carry with me. Oh and what a good eater he had become with these 4 teeth finally in place. He would eat everything with this gusto and make delighted ""mmmh"" and ""oh"" sounds when he liked what I cooked and my heart would jump with joy seeing his pleasure and how much he enjoyed it.

And then there was the evening before yesterday. We sit in my husband's office while our little one crawls around and explores. He started walking just 2 weeks ago and can manage 5-6 steps at a time. He starts pulling himself up an older guitar stand and I tell my husband to not let him go up there since it's very wobbly and ask him once again to please place the weights he uses for exercising some place safer. Should our baby son ever fall on those, we would surely end up in the ER.

It is the morning after, I am in the kitchen, preparing breakfast. I am almost ready, we are running late and it is past time for our baby's first nap. I just want to finish preparing the coffee, so we can all sit down, but I have this weird feeling in my stomach that I should just call them over already. But it's too late when I hear it, my son's cry. It's one of the painful ones. One of the ones I used to get angry about because they hurt me in my guts and mostly happened when he wasn't watching him close enough, especially when the little bundle of joy gets tired, yet adventurous and unpredictable while still so wobbly on his feet. And I hear the words ringing in my ears ""you have to watch him closely when he is tired"".
I go to the hallway when I see him comforting our son, but there is blood on his face, blood on my husband's shirt and the blood freezes in my veins. 
Please don't let it be his teeth, I pray.
I nurse him to calm him down and gently lay him on the floor to catch a glimpse, but my stomach is a pit, and I'm scared of what I may find. And there it is, one of his upper front teeth is bend towards me, ripped out of the socket in a 90 degrees angle. This beautiful baby tooth not yet fully grown and blood everywhere. I gasp. 
My husband was in his office with our son, he was tired since he slept little that night and was on the phone checking something and our baby boy tiredly pulled himself up on the guitar stand and fell on one of the weights front teeth first.... my nightmare came true. My warnings had no purpose, no weight and they evaporate into thin air.
We need to go to an on-call dentist. 
They tell us there is nothing to be done, we should come back after the weekend, maybe the tooth will fall out on its own. But what if he aspirates? ""No this can't happen"", they say. We are home, but again there is this nagging feeling, ""what if, what if"" . I can't go to sleep like this and risk allowing another accident to happen when he might aspirate it in his sleep. I would not forgive myself.
We go to another dentist and they confirm our worries and suspicion that the tooth was very loose and could be a suffocation threat. It needs to be pulled. They can't give him any aenesthetic or sedate him, he is too small. ""To small to be here, too small to lose his first tooth"" my thoughts whisper. I lay him on the examination seat and we try to distract him with the lights and a toy. The doctor pulls once, my boy cries but it's not done. He has to go again, and so I need to hold him and as he screams and cries, tears start rolling down my cheeks. Seeing him spread out like that, helplessly crying for his mummy, breaks my heart and I can barely look at him and this precious little part of him being forecefully ripped out. 
I had bought this little box during my pregnancy with ""my firsts"". My first shoes, my first hair lock, my first hat, my first tooth... I remember wondering ""which one will it be, how will he or we wiggle it out? Will he be old enough and into the tooth fairy"". This memory pops into my head out of nowhere as I look at the bloody baby tooth in the plastic bag in my hand. 
We leave the doctor's office, words still racing through our minds ""the next tooth may come slower, maybe with 6 or 7 years. If not he may need surgery. The nerve may be damaged so we need to do x-rays regularly. 
We need to do follow-up appointments as to ensure the other tooth has not been damaged. He may develop a speech disorder, so we need to observe this and do therapy."" The words weigh like heavy stones in my heart and stomach and I feel sick. At home I prepare him some soft food, he is in pain, barely wants to eat. The next day I make him pancakes, the one he loves with banana and almond cream. He struggles eating them, stops after a few bites. I feel the tears rising up again. I can't stop the thoughts, the worry, the guilt, the shame, the mourning of a ""could have been"", the regret and the anger...

My husband says he is sorry. He sees it as a warning; he has learned his lesson and maybe it happened so something worse would not happen in the future. He tries to move on. It sounds rational, healthy even, not to linger on the pain, but his words make me shiver on the inside. Why could my warnings and requests not have been enough of a final warning, why were you on the phone when you know he was tired and not in a safe place, why was I not more persistent about the weights, why could my boy not have been in bed next to me snuggling up already, as he should have been. Why, why, why. My throughts keep running in circles. Exchanging hands with images of his gap smile, of the bloody tooth, of him crying and reaching for me, of my husband laughing with him as he is moving on, of his bloody face and I cannot stop them from coming. I am on the outside looking in. I feel left behind and not understood. I feel melodramatic and yet cannot seem to stop myself and to lighten up, because I feel heavy as a rock. I carry this pit in me. The worries of what's ahead of us in the next years. The longing for our happy little meals. The easy-going me that simply laughs and goofily plays with our kiddo. I want the thoughts to stop. My old self to come back. The regrets and blaming to seize. The tunnel to feel less cold and dark and lonely but I don't know how to get there. How to forgive myself and him, how to trust again, how to let go, when this is not just a wound that is going to heal over and leave a scar but sth that will accompany us for the next 5 years at least. With regular appointments and speech therapy.

I know that accidents happen. I know that it was not on purpose. I know that time heals. I know that I have to look to the future and try to be brave for my little boy and to let go of the hard feelings for my husband and myself to heal our relationship. To be grateful that nothing worse happened when it definitely could have and that he is alive and well and still with us and it was ""only"" his tooth. And I am, I truly am. I just wish those sayings and ""truths"" were more comforting and gave me more strength to move on.

 I have read a lot of stories of older kids, 2+ but not one case of such a small little angel. Did anyone go through a similar experience and has any advice on how to get through it and how to work through the feelings of fear, regret, guilt and blame I have?

1fvz565,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderDrones/comments/1fvz565/parabellum_chapter_ii_continued/,"Parabellum, Chapter II Continued","Uzi stared at herself in the mirror, shakily brushing away some strands of dull purple that had fallen into her face. *Christ, she looked like hell.* There were visible bags under her dimmed neon purple optics, her hair was frizzy and in dire need of brushing from having a hood draped over it for so long—and her arms trembled slightly. Her striped sweater had traces of dried blood along the sleeve even though she was sure her overcoat had covered everything. The corpse she had left behind—unceremoniously shoved in a stolen Mercedes sedan trunk—flashed non-stop in her mind like a cassette on repeat. The very moment she had walked into her apartment, she threw off her overcoat that had her pistol safely stashed away as if someone had slipped molten iron inside, leaving it on the cold floor. The high-rise apartment complex itself was a physical asset owned by Don Rossi’s real estate firm, but just behind the curtain was an intricate money laundering scheme that had gone on for years without a hitch. For three years, millions upon millions of dollars flowed into the pockets of the *consiglieri*, the mafia proper, and the Don himself. Being a made member of the mob, Uzi was given “special treatment” by the firm—essentially free living, something the teen certainly wasn't complaining about, especially at a time like this. The police no doubt had recovered the remains of Oliver Mackenzie—the only abhorrent piece of evidence she had left behind—but Uzi couldn't bring herself to turn on the TV. When she reached for the remote—or tried to—her arm would not move even slightly. Those shot-out eyes seared themselves into her thoughts, and the nineteen-year-old drone’s synthetic stomach lurched with every shaky breath she drew. She had done it so *carelessly*, so *effortlessly* just an hour ago—left the body in the stolen sedan and made off like she had just departed a taxi—and now here she was, shaking like a leaf in autumn. Her hands trembled with a relentless force even as she gripped the porcelain sink, her legs as weak as an old lady's. Her heart pounded against her chest with all of the force of an automatic rifle—halfly from adrenaline, and half from the constant feeling of being *watched.* Uzi knew that she was the only one in her small apartment, but even looking away from the bathroom mirror made all of the hairs on her body stand on end. She squeezed her optics shut and ground her teeth—trying, *trying* to wrest away those reddish black holes where two sea-blue orbs once laid—yet it clung to her like a leech that refused to let go of its host. Her gaze once again floated back to the mirror, and her optics hollowed in *fear* and resentment. She so badly wanted to punch the mirror with all of the strength she still had in her trembling arms—to scream at it to stop displaying her—but her grip only tightened on the gleaming white bathroom sink, as if some intangible entity had nailed her hands to the porcelain without her knowledge. She had stopped feeling the cold tiles long ago, only wishing for it to open up and swallow her whole—she wouldn't object to it. Sure, she had killed before—but never like this. It had always been a single shot. A clean—scarily accurate hit that would ensure minimal suffering—if at all. Why was this so different? Why was it so—so *brutal*? Uzi could barely reconcile herself with the woman that had committed such an *obscene*, *animalistic* act merely an hour or two ago. Her frame began to shake again—this time much more violently than before, and the teenage drone felt like an airtight bag had been yanked over her head and zipped tight. Uzi’s arms flew to her head, her hands grabbing tufts of her dull purple locks—yanking it as hard as she could, as she was a mountain climber hanging onto a rope for dear life after slipping. The guttural scream that should've ripped through her throat was instead blocked up, creating a burning sensation akin to that of taking a swig of whiskey—but the burn didn't last for a fleeting second. She once again squeezed her optics shut, stumbling out of the bathroom—but even in the darkness, all she could see were those eyes—as blue as the Pacific Ocean—widening for the final time as they stared down the very last thing they'd ever see—a suppressor. A jolt of pain made Uzi's optics snap open as the back of her foot made contact with the drawers under her bed—causing the teen to fall back and onto the mattress.        
But even the embrace of the soft, plush material did little to calm the storm raging in her. Tears began to flow down, the sheer number of which akin to the constant downpour just outside. She curled into herself, bringing her knees up to her chest—the cold Seattle wind that always happened to be infused with the earthy smell of rain flowing over her, softly whistling—*mocking* her pitiful state. Sobs wracked her body, but even then the memories were ceaseless. The rain began to get louder, along with the constant thrum of her heart in her auditory receptors. Every rustle of the blanket was amplified tenfold—but the constant hammering of the rain overpowered all but the rapid fire of her heart. At the blare of a far-away ferry horn that sounded like it had barked right in front of her, she shot up in a cold sweat, like she had been hit full-blast with a water shotgun after sleeping in the scorching desert sands of the Sahara for months—tears still rolling down her visor and burning her optics like the relentless African sun. Uzi wanted to scream—she wanted to dig her nails into her casing and tear it off, piece by agonizing piece—to curl up into the fetal position and… She wasn't sure what else. With every move, she couldn't stop shaking—every inch forward carrying the crushing weight of what she had just done. It was so *unlike* her to do something so *cruel*. She never made anyone suffer unnecessarily—and yet, she just did. She created fear, and she **reveled** in it. *Why?* The question rained down on her unraveling mind like a jury casting accusations, and yet the answer itself eluded her. But what disgusted—*repulsed* Uzi the most is that she **enjoyed it**. The feeling of control, it was like lightning upon a live wire. It made her feel *alive* in the most sickening way. Maybe she just wanted to get it over with. Maybe she was mad. Mad at something, *anything*. The rain still ceaselessly *pitter-pattered* outside, and Uzi shakily turned her head to the open window to her right, where the cold air danced from the outside world to the inside of Uzi's apartment. She gazed out to the city with hollowed, red-rimmed and haunted optics—and was met with the usual blinding neon lights that seemed to infect every inch of the city, the bark of car horns in the distance, sprawling skyscrapers that seemed to reach the heavens and reduce the labyrinth on ground level to mere ants, along with the acrid smell of car exhaust mixing with the earthy aroma of the rain, algae, and ocean water from the close-by Lake Washington. Along with that concoction of smell, the bittersweet scent of coffee that seemed to cover the whole city at times wafted into the apartment, a more than welcome undertone. To the left of her was a campus that always looked like it had just been snatched right out of time itself—the sprawling labyrinth of the University of Washington, where she was currently studying. Further beyond that was the now-quiet Husky Stadiums, covered in colored fallen leaves, blown in by the chilly November wind and most definitely soaked with rainwater. Even after all of these centuries—in 3071—it still hadn't changed a bit. The architecture of its many units and departments still retained its Victorian-era exterior; only enlarged and fitted with a renovated interior to fit present needs, but it still held that grand old man mystique amidst the neon lights and 4D billboards of the city. It always teemed with activity—always at least one or two lights on throughout the night. The windowsill was slick with rainwater, small puddles gleaming in the moonlight—reflecting the overcast Seattle skyline. The upper part of the window was blurred by the trillions of droplets landing on it every couple seconds, leaving it a distorted mess of outlines and piercing city lights—so bright, yet so dim and out of reach.           
  
Occasionally, a raindrop would slip in and land with a soft *plip*, making the drone jolt slightly. All the same, the scenery served to comfort her. The rolling gray clouds above that seemed to pour out tiny droplets of water non-stop were oddly relaxing—as if it was sucking up all of Uzi's darkest urges and carrying it far away, but dropping tiny, microscopic fragments of them along the way as cruel reminders of what she had just done. For a moment, she finally got rid of those eyes, those thin ribbons of veins that laid exposed along with the gushing crimson that seemed to never stop after she pulled the trigger. For a moment, she finally felt *free* after what seemed like a lifetime’s worth of torment. If only that really were the case. The opening chords of the instrumental version of *Everlong* plucked her back into reality, and nearly made her jump out of her own casing. With it, a large transparent neon-purple-outlined rectangle obstructed her vision.      
  
**INCOMING VOICE CALL.**  There was no name—or no name Uzi could see, as she was currently tunnel visioning on the purple-colored words that were quite literally in her face. She let the call ring for a moment, absentmindedly swaying her head back and forth to the distorted riffs and drums that hammered its way into her skull, her knees once more drawn to her chest as she relentlessly fought to push away the imagery that made her heart drop into her synthetic stomach. *Drip*. Uzi was once again plucked from her music-induced trance by the sound of a raindrop, and she scrambled to answer the call before it faded from her sight. There was no encryption software Uzi had implemented—after all, who would think such a seemingly average, introverted, awkward college student would be a mobster for one of the most influential crime families in not only Seattle, but in all of the *fifty states*? But now, that was most certainly a possibility in her eyes. She cleared her throat, and shakily answered the call. Had she slipped up somehow? Had they finally caught up to her? But she had done everything right, and used her *MASK* software, perfectly evading law enforcement without a single… *Major* hitch. Surely they wouldn’t know—*right?* ‘*Please don’t let it be who I think it is…*’

  There was a silence that seemed to stretch on and on for millennia, even though Uzi was sure it was only for a couple seconds. Questions raced through her mind at an impossible speed. *Should she speak up?* She held her tongue, nervously flicking her sweater zipper.

“Hey, ‘zi!” She was greeted with a chipper voice that broke through the tension and made her heart skip two beats, and Uzi exhaled a relieved breath she didn't even know she was holding in. She stuttered and tripped over her words, trying to formulate a coherent response and failing miserably each time. Her dark purple laptop lay on the foot of the bed—half-opened—but the display was completely black. Most likely dead. Uzi inwardly facepalmed. Before she left, she had forgotten to charge it—and she had a couple papers due. *‘Shit, shit, shit.*’ “Uzi, ya there?” She was once again taken out of her thoughts. “Y-yeah.” She managed to splutter out. Her gaze fixed on her laptop as yet another wave of worry came at her with the force of a square wave. The youthful voice on the other end was Gryffin, her childhood friend—and longtime crush. 

   He was also V’s brother.

   “You sound… *off*. You alright?” His voice took on a softer, more warm tone. He was known for being one of the nicest guys on campus—far too nice for this world. He never got into fights—and rarely raised his voice at all. Most of all he was blissfully oblivious to his sister's actual life, in spite of her more-than-well-off lifestyle. Uzi herself was completely out of the question—due to her seemingly unremarkable life, certainly not befitting of a mobster. Not that Gryffin hadn't gotten suspicious about the couple hundred dollars thrown at him whenever he was in need—but V was an expert liar, and the one Uzi had picked up her own silver tongue from. She always had some believable story to weave seemingly from thin air, and Uzi admired her for that. 

  But even the best liars slip up.

  “I'm fine. Just… Tired.” She replied, after yet another bout of stuttering. Her heart fluttered when she heard him lightly chuckle in response, in spite of it currently beating faster than a Chiron on a good day. He always managed to find humor in everything—everything he reasonably could.

“I thought I'd never see the day you'd run out of energy. Guess the non-stop work’s finally caught up, huh, *Miss* *Workaholic*?” Uzi willed Gryffin to get to the point—her visor flushing in spite of the mental whirlpool she was currently fighting off. She tugged at her sweater, trying not to look at the small smear of crusted dried blood that streaked across the black and white stripes. “You left so suddenly. Did something happen?” Uzi's oil ran cold in her veins. Instead of an airtight alibi that was stitched together in mere microseconds—Uzi’s only response was silence. 

She had taken off while they were working on a humanities assignment with their other friends that couldn’t have picked a worse time to be assigned. In hindsight, Uzi was lucky that she had gotten that text when she did—she would've ended up saying something she'd probably deeply regret if she had been there a second longer. Against her better judgment, she eyed the small dried bloodstain that she could never escape seeing, trying to swim against the ever-growing, ever-present current of fear that kept the words—the silk to which the web was spun—stuck in her throat. The whistling wind beat against the glass of the window, pelting fat raindrops farther into the apartment, as if to try to shake her out of her woolgathering. Uzi silently wished—prayed—that this ever-turning world would slow its pace, if only for a second. While it spun, and spun, and spun without cease—she was miles behind—trying to hastily pick up the pieces and join it, only to do it all again.

   But time—the cruel mistress—would not heed her plea. Her optics began to drift once more, and she found herself aimlessly staring into space. Perhaps Uzi *wasn't* the same person—perhaps she had been transferred to another body, forced to watch whoever she now inhabited kill a man for simply doing his job in the most inhumane way. Maybe she'd wake up to the cold bristle of the wind, the constant chill of the now-moistened cardboard box she had curled herself into dampening her clothing and seeping into her casing—and the constant pang of hunger in the pit of her stomach. Maybe she'd be seven again—roaming the alleyways of Wallingford in soaked, torn rags that barely kept her warm. Her optic slightly glitched at the memories, and she winced. Did she *really* want to go back to that life? 

  “Er… Yeah, something like that,” She managed to mumble, her trembling fingers threading through her dull purple hair. It still stung—having to lie to him non-stop like this, even if it was a half-lie. Every word that fell from Uzi’s tongue felt as heavy as an anvil and as acrid as cyanide, and she felt a constant ping in her stomach that spread up her back in a matter of seconds. But at the same time, the teenage drone couldn’t bring herself to even think about what would happen if she told him the actual truth. Her optics flitted between the overcoat that she had hastily discarded near her apartment door, and the blurred window. The grip of her suppressed *M9* peeked out of the inner pocket, the outer steel gleaming in the pale autumn moonlight while the leather, in contrast, only offered a dull shine. Everywhere she turned, she was reminded of what she had just done, as if some vengeful spirit of days past decided to go out of its way to make her life more of a living Hell than it already was. Her mouth twitched at the sight, her optics hollowing—and the words once again entangled themselves within her voice box. The follow-up was there, yes, but it felt too flimsy. “I—” She stopped herself, and once again began to fidget with her sweater sleeve. ‘*Keep it together. Keep it together.*’ She told herself, swallowing hard. She had lost track of how many times she had repeated it to herself already, as if it was the only source of comfort in a world that wouldn't stop taking from someone that already had no more to give. She wished, pleaded that the words would finally come out—that she'd be rid of this deafening silence that made her auditory receptors ring as if she had just stepped out of a metal concert—but the words remained stuck to her synthetic vocal chords. “Uzi, talk to me. Something's wrong. You're normally not this quiet. Did something happen?” The already stuck-up words had now forced themselves into her voice box and out of her memory. “I can hear your breathing. Are you hurt?” Her breath caught in her synthetic windpipe. She held her breath as if she was a diver that had gone too deep in the Mariana, her hollowed optics darting around as if she was looking for some unseen threat. Panic seized her before she could even properly process what was going on, and she froze—not daring to even utter a word. Then the words came out faster than she could catch them. “N-no, of course not,” She spluttered, her words laced with anxiety instead of the usual monotone angst, something she tried her damn hardest to cover up. The words themselves spilled out like word-vomit, but he somehow caught each one. “I'm just a bit paranoid about a couple other projects I have due.” She nervously laughed in spite of the pang of guilt that spread throughout her skull like pain, and subsequently mentally berated herself for telling the single-most unconvincing lie she had ever told in her nineteen years of existence. ‘*That could've gone* ***so*** *much better. Goddamn it, Uzi! You can do better than this!*’ 

  She mentally shook herself, a vain attempt to gather her scattered thoughts, which were like files that fell from an overturned cabinet. She was supposed to be mysterious, unflappable—yet here she was, falling apart at the seams just by the sound of her crush's infectious voice. She was probably just being delusional, there was no way in Hell he'd be into someone like *her*. Maybe she needed to get more sleep. Uzi once again mentally slapped herself with such force she felt the sting of the hit. It was a pathetic thought to think Gryfiin would hold an iota of romantic interest in her, yet that fuzzy, almost calming warmth that came with hearing his voice would not fade, as much as she tried to suffocate it—much to the drone's dismay. Instead, it began to spread throughout her body—sending shiver after shiver down her spine. “I- I also had to run a couple errands. It was getting late either way, so…” She once again trailed off, the words leaving her mind. Yet another semi-fabrication. It was true, she had to run due to it getting late, and because he lived in Golden Dragon Triad territory. Just weeks earlier, J had gotten into a bare-knuckle fight with an enforcer during an arms deal gone wrong and ended up beating the bastard into a pulp, so anyone polishing Rossi’s boots with their saliva wasn't exactly welcomed with open arms there. It was also true that she was pinged to run an “*errand*” that ended in one brutal death that would more than likely end up on the Seattle Sentinel front page for the week. Wait a minute… *Eureka.*

   “And after I saw the news; it…” She audibly, yet shakily exhaled for extra emphasis. The guilt in the pit of her stomach subsequently transformed into nausea, and bile crawled up her throat from what she had just done. She had just added a gallon of gasoline to an already raging fire she could barely contain, much less put out. Uzi’s head slowly sank into her hands, tears brimming and stinging her optics—but not yet falling down, staying in its place like a branding iron being pressed against skin. She shook her head against her palms, forcing down the rising bile and steeling herself, just as she had done many times before. She heard Gryffin hiss on the other end. “Yeah, it creeped me out too. Can't believe someone would do that.” Uzi recoiled as if she had been punched directly in the gut, her breath hitching as she began to once more fiercely fight against the incoming wave of scarlet and exposed vein that seared itself into her memory as the call settled into an awkward silence. If only he knew that she was the monster that had been behind something so *vile*, so inhumane, and yet here she was—hiding behind half-truths like a coward. Her hands clutched at her head, trembling like brittle leaves in a thunderstorm. She wanted to scream—scream until her vocal chords gave out, plead to whatever deity that wouldn’t let her rest to forgive her and make it stop until it would finally be cleared from her mind. It only worsened as she squeezed her optics shut, only becoming increasingly more vivid—more *detailed*. It was J’s fault for getting Oliver so close, why’d *Uzi* have to be the one to do it? Why had she agreed to track him down? But it wasn't like she had anything better to do at the moment, and if memory served, J’s hands were quite literally tied at that moment—courtesy of the Triads for beating one of theirs to an oily pulp. Either way, Uzi was aching to escape the endless flood of academia, textbooks, and never-ending studying. But this was *so* not how she wanted to end her night. ‘*Stupid, stupid, stupid!*’ Her fists clenched, grabbing tufts of her unkempt dull purple locks, and she began to pull—a dull burning sensation crawling throughout her scalp with each tug. Her racing mind returned to the saint that she waved back and forth just close to three years ago, her oil bubbling within the crackling orangish-blue flame that looked like the sky when the sun’s first rays peeked out of the darkness of the night as she took the oath that solidified her as judge, jury, and executioner. Except this was anything but that. She was in a lifelong debt to her father; to Aurelio Rossi, for saving her life when the federal government *wouldn’t*, and this was how she’d repay the favor. ‘*This was necessary, wasn’t it? I had to do this.*’ “I need to get some sleep. Talk to you tomorrow?” She muttered, trying to keep her voice steady. Uzi knew there was no way she’d be getting even a millisecond of sleep even if she chanted that mantra to herself a thousand times over, but she needed something—*anything* to break the long silence that made her already scattered thoughts become more and more outlandish. “Yeah, that’s fine. Just wanted to check up on you. See you tomorrow, ‘zi. Be safe” He said, his voice tinged with comfort that reeked of pity.    Before the teen could return the gesture, the line cut, and there was silence.   Uzi tossed and turned as minutes stretched into what seemed like whole lifetimes, her optics wide open and hollowed out—the thick blanket draped over her frame not doing nearly enough to keep her warm as she began to quiver and shake, pixelated sweat pouring down her visor as the teen let out a barely audible whimper. The memories once again pounced upon her like a beast from the shadows, who patiently waited for its prey to come out of hiding and stumble into its hunting grounds. Now it was just the encroaching darkness, the pale half-moon that hung high above the overcast Seattle sky, the whistling wind that subtly blew strands of her hair to and fro, and the pelting rain to keep her company. Her gaze once again drifted to the discarded overcoat on the cold hardwood floor, right next to the plush silver fur carpet. The sweater she wore felt like it was pressing into her casing—suffocating her the more she looked at the overcoat, yet her optics would not move from it as her CPU raced between college life and the one that she kept close to her chest like a poker player would keep his cards.

We tend to do 20 minutes on the bikes, 10 on the treadmill (I’m working up to more on the treadmill, I’ll explain more later) and then alternate between arms and legs for the weight machines. 

My goal is to strengthen my shoulders/arms and if I lose a little weight and tone up, I’ll be happy as I know I need to having gained a fair bit after an accident and the resulting health complications. However, I’ve gained about 7lbs since joining. I’m not eating more than usual, I track what I eat, literally everything right down to the creamer in my morning coffee or the splash of milk in my tea. I don’t have a huge appetite as it is, so I don’t overeat. I cook for us both most nights, nothing massively fatty - simple protein (usually chicken, sometimes pork, very occasionally beef; I’d like more fish, but I’m working on that), carb (usually pasta or rice, in part of an Italian family) and veggies. I don’t snack during the day unless my sugars crash (type 1 diabetic, I’m prone to crashes) and then it’s only enough to bump them back into range.  Breakfast tends to be a cup of cereal with a 1/4 cup 2% milk, lunch is a sandwich with an apple and the evening meal will vary. I drink upwards of 12 cups of water per day.

Why am I gaining weight?

A little about me:

42 female, multiple chronic health conditions after a bad accident a few years ago that affect my mobility—hence why I’m working up to more time on the treadmill, I was in a wheelchair for a long time, I’m out of it now, which I’m super proud of. One of the health conditions affects my digestive system so there are some foods I literally cannot eat as I can’t digest them at all (beans, pulses, citrus fruits, to name a couple).  Any advice would be great because I’m starting to feel bad about myself and my efforts! Thank you in advance. ",0,1728048168.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,0.5,False

1fvyztt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fvyztt,1984 Toyota Celica-Supra A60,"Years ago before I started attending car events and cars & coffee meetups the only way I could see and chat about interning cars was at the petrol station IF I was lucky enough to spot something interesting while I was there. Well a few weeks back I was filling up and in this 1984 Celica Supra came. It sounded peachy and is in mint condition so of course I had to go over for a look and a chat. The owner was only too delighted to chat about his pride and joy and how his ownership of it came about. It's not always the cars themselves that are impressive but often times the best part of the car is the story behind it! I won't go into the story behind this car but let me introduce the car in question to ye..

This is a 1984 Toyota Celica-Supra A60 (Gen 2). It's powered by an inline 6cyl 2.8L 12-valve DOHC engine producing 160bhp. In the 1980's these were very healthy performance figures and the handling of this car was also ahead of its time. The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and featured variable assisted power rack-and-pinion steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing arm suspension with coil springs and a stabilizer bar.

This car marked a very clear indication that Toyota was taking aim at the greater sports coupe market after the success of the first gen Celica Supra taking on established sports cars like the Datsun 280z.

The A60 was also the last time we would see the Celica and Supra  in the same model as Toyota separated the two lines and made the Celica a front-wheel-drive platform and kept the rear-wheel-drive layout for the Supra line.

He handles things very immature and is not setting a good example for our daughters. He’s a great dad, and we spilt the responsibilities 50/50. But he is constantly treating with such disrespect. 

This morning he was getting ready for work and when I came down with one of the girls he told me to go upstairs. They were crying and he was getting ready so I stated making their milk and what not and told him I was going to do some of the responsibilities make my coffee then go upstairs. He started saying things in front of our children like “I can’t stand being around you” “I just don’t like you” “I thought you were going upstairs right after coffee you’re a pathological liar” “I don’t fucking care what you think about me” “I have my own plan” he talks so much shit about my family coming to visit. And then even mocks them in an immature voice. The girls are listening and watching all of this. I told him he is the most immature person and I will not engage in this type of behavior with my girls around. One day he wants to be with me and works things out and the other he hates me. I never know what kind of mood he is going to be in.

He handles things very immature and is not setting a good example for our daughters. He’s a great dad, and we spilt the responsibilities 50/50. But he is constantly treating with such disrespect. 

This morning he was getting ready for work and when I came down with one of the girls he told me to go upstairs. They were crying and he was getting ready so I stated making their milk and what not and told him I was going to do some of the responsibilities make my coffee then go upstairs. He started saying things in front of our children like “I can’t stand being around you” “I just don’t like you” “I thought you were going upstairs right after coffee you’re a pathological liar” “I don’t fucking care what you think about me” “I have my own plan” he talks so much shit about my family coming to visit. And then even mocks them in an immature voice. The girls are listening and watching all of this. I told him he is the most immature person and I will not engage in this type of behavior with my girls around. One day he wants to be with me and works things out and the other he hates me. I never know what kind of mood he is going to be in. 

I literally can’t stand him, he makes my blood boil and my heart race. He causes me so much stress and anxiety. Luckily once he is out of the house I am fine and can go on about my day. 

How do I tolerate such behavior? Please don’t say move out because that’s not an option at this point. ",3,1728047816.0,coparenting,9,1.0,False

WORD COUNT: 1,947

I pull into the lot, avoiding the sea of potholes lining the curb. My windshield wipers are working overtime as the rain comes down in sheets, and of course, not a soul in sight—just how I like it. 

I hate to admit it, but the place always looks a bit ridiculous in this wet weather, like some sad, soggy amusement park. April showers brings May flowers has never been truer. 

As I step out, I plunge my foot directly into a puddle, immediately soaking my shoe, because why wouldn’t it? 

“Oh great!” I mutter, sleep still present in my tone. I shake out my foot in front of myself, as if doing this could have actually been helpful, “just perfect.” I add with a heavy sigh. 

I’ve heard that the use of positive words, even when expressing negative feelings, can have an incredible impact on keeping one’s mental health in tip-top shape. I’m not expecting much, but I
decided I’d give it a shot anyways. I don’t know how long it’s supposed to take before it starts working, but I could really use some mental support today. Because, whenever there’s rain, there is sure to be a busy work day to follow.

I’ve never quite understood why rain makes the masses rush to the car wash. It’s bizarre. Why waste precious time driving through heavy traffic, navigating the chaos of rain-slicked streets, just to come here for a wash? Do they think the rain makes it the perfect time, imagining they’ve got it all figured out, that fewer people will be here? Or maybe it’s simply the sight of rainwater that triggers this sudden burst of genius—""I'll wash it now, while no one else is thinking about it!"" Like they’re convinced rainwater just isn’t enough—isn’t up to par with the level of quality they prefer, that it lacks the magic that the car wash’s water has? They must feel like they've cracked some secret life-hack, as if this abundance of free water falling from the sky isn’t enough to do the job. 

It doesn’t make any sense, but it doesn’t surprise me. Not anymore. I’ve become well-accustomed to planning accordingly when it comes to scheduling when rain is expected. I always ensure enough labor is scheduled in order to support the anticipated influx of sharp-minded customers; to combat the flood. Which is why I was wary when the call came in first thing in the morning.

I’m halfway to the door when I hear it: the phone, ringing inside the office, again. It’s like the damn thing knows when I’m about to clock in.

“Great.” I think to myself, making sure to practice using positive connotations. “someone’s already got a problem at seven in the morning, and I haven’t even had my coffee.”  

I need to work on expanding my vocabulary. My positive word bucket isn’t quite as broad as some of my other, more frequently used, word buckets. 

I swipe my badge, let the door click open, and the obnoxious ring is even louder. I tread through the empty hall with extreme caution and mindfulness to the dangers of these slick floors. My steps alternate between a soppy, wet sucking sound and a screeching, rubber squawk.

Guess today’s off to a fantastic start.

The place looks like an aquatic theme park threw up all over it. Bright blue waves painted on the walls, neon fish hanging from the ceiling, and for some reason, the sounds of whale calls echoing through the speakers—because apparently, people want to feel like they’re getting their car washed in the middle of the ocean. As if the suds, made to look like sea foam, weren’t enough for their imagination. 

Don’t get me wrong, it pulls in the cash. The customers eat it up, snapping pictures like they’re at some underwater zoo. I just smile, nod like I care, and make sure no one breaks the damn dolphin statues out front. 

In the office, the smell of leftover pizza and the faint proof of something sugary sweet hit my nose like a bag of bricks. I feel irritation crawling up my spine, my face getting hot. I reach for the phone, drip water all over my cluttered desk—junk from the employee pizza party last night. The one I gladly did not participate in.

“lovely,” I say as I pick up the phone, “good morning! You’ve reached the shine-line. How can we polish up your day?”

“Uhh hey,” the voice on the line mumbles, “it’s, uh, Mikey.”

“oh, hey there, uh, Mikey.” I say with a gradual increase of charm in my tone, not allowing negativity to impinge on my attitude. “What’s going on?”

“Uh, well, it’s just—I’m not going to be able to come into work today.”  Then there is silence. I wait for him to offer an explanation. “my, my car won’t start and uh, I can’t get it looked at today.” He says with a pout.

“Mikey,” I begin, keeping my voice steady, “I’m really counting on you to be here today,” 

“I know, I’m sorry Mr. Summers,” he says with a yawn, then hangs up the call.

“Unbelievable!” I shout, covering my mouth as quickly as I’d said it. This is a recast of the last time Mikey was scheduled on a rainy day. I make a mental note: I will address this issue with Mikey at a later time today.

Just then, I hear the door click open from down the hall and my heart skips a beat. No one is scheduled to be here this early. I hear wet footsteps coming towards my office. I holler, “hello, who’s there?” but no one answers. 

I swivel my chair around and take a seat, waiting for whoever it is to appear in my doorway, but no one ever does. 

“Hello?” I sing this time, rather than simply saying it, “anybody there?” But still, I’m met with only silence.

I abruptly rise from my chair with a subtle toss of my hands, shaking my head, but telling myself, “this should be a pleasant encounter.” 

Just as I start for the door leading to the hallway, the phone rings again, cutting through the quiet air like a blade. I squeal simultaneously as my reflexes knock me off balance atop the slippery floor. I’m running  backwards in place, my arms pinwheeling. I lean my weight, reaching for the sturdy doorframe. Just by the skin of my teeth, I manage to steady myself without inflicting any injuries.

Once I catch my breath, without having to remind myself to look on the bright side, I let out a long stream of laughter that makes tears well up in my eyes. The muscles in my stomach ached from many years of neglecting them. Holding my stomach, wiping happy tears from eyes, I pick up the phone.

“We’re having a spic-and-span-tastic day here at Bubbles Over Troubles. How can I make your day sparkle?”

“Hey, good morning Mr. Summers,” the caller begins, “it’s me, Mandy.”

“oh hey Mandy! What’s going on?”

“Listen… about my shift for today,” she says it long and drawn out, articulating every syllable, pronouncing every letter. I drum my fingers on the desk, then snatch my hand away when my fingers splash in a pool of water from my dripping over the last phone call.

“Mandy,” I say softly, “if you’re calling out, I do not approve. You absolutely must be here today.”

“Mr. Summers, you don’t understand. I have to prioritize my safety over—”

“I don’t want to hear excuses! You have no choice, Mandy! You have to work your scheduled shift today.”

Mandy doesn’t say anything. And I probably should have waited a little longer for her response. But my patience has been worn thin with the constant call-outs. They know better than to try making adjustments to their schedule on the same day.

“I’ll take your silence as your acclimation to your obligations as an employee under this establishment. Good bye.”

I slam the phone down before giving Mandy a fair chance to respond. 

“That might have been a little harsh,” I tell myself, “I didn’t have to say it like that. I owe her an apology.” 

I remind myself: positive words, optimism—don’t forget it. 

I pick up the phone to call her back, but before I can press redial, I freeze. I’d almost forgotten about the spook from earlier—hearing the front door unexpectedly open and the footsteps that followed. I whip my head around, scanning the room. 

“I’m sorry, but we’re closed. We open at 9 a.m.” I croak, despite my jittery nerves causing my voice to shake. When I still don’t hear a response, I am overcome by something like adrenaline. I breathe out a dramatic huff, then clench my fists tight, but I stop myself, relaxing my posture and forcing a friendly smile. Now composed, I swiftly search the halls, the entryway and the guest seating areas, but they’re all empty. 

Driven with a determination to make sense of everything, if nothing else, I knock on both the bathroom doors, opening each one after knocking to ensure no one has snuck in. But when I do, I find nothing more than 2 empty bathrooms. 

As strange as it is, I don’t have time to waste. Besides, I’ve already looked everywhere there is to look. If someone did come in, they must have realized themselves that we weren’t open, and let themselves back outside—it’s not like we have an underground cellar or safe room for someone to hide in.

I shrug, and head back to the office to complete opening procedure.

“Looking for something, Mr. Summers?” a voice scratches at my ears. My legs quit working and I stiffen mid stride. As I stood motionless just outside the office, I feared the worst. The mysterious voice was unrecognizable, but undoubtedly real. I got a grip of myself, glanced around, ready to confront whatever—or whoever—was behind all of this. 

But just as I was about to take a step forward, a chorus of cheerful voices burst through the front door.

“Surprise!” they shouted, and I nearly fainted, my mind pounding as I realized what had happened. My employees poured into the building waving streamers and holding a giant banner that read, “Happy April Fools’ Day!” 

“What is this?” I managed to ask, bewildered as they flooded in with plates piled high with pancakes, fresh fruit, and a huge cake that had a ridiculous figure of me on it.

“We thought you might feel left out after last night’s pizza party,” Mandy explained, stepping forward with a plate of food. “So we planned this little surprise. Sorry about the prank calls and the footsteps; we wanted to keep it festive!” 

I looked around at all their bright, cheerful, smiling faces, how excited they all looked that their planning has paid off. My initial frustration quickly melted away. 

“You all got me good,” I chuckled, shaking my head in disbelief. “I was ready to confront a ghost!” Laughter erupting from deep within my belly, dissolving the tension that had wrapped around me all morning. 

It hit me then, despite the chaos and the pranks, my team had come together to show their appreciation. I couldn’t help but feel idolized. 

I could really get used to this happy environment—and my wonderful staff. Maybe that bit I’d heard about positive speech wasn’t such a fluke after all. 

“Alright, let’s dig in,” I said, feeling a genuine smile spread across my face. “But just so you know, if anyone’s car breaks down today, I’m definitely not picking up the phone!”

I've been on the hunt for a more suitable subreddit, and it looks like this one might just be the top pick.*

Hey everyone,

I’ve found myself in a bit of a strange and unsettling situation, and I could really use some advice—and maybe a few creative ideas on how to handle it. Here’s the full story:

I recently moved into an apartment for a short stay. It’s owned by a family friend who offered it to me for 15 days because she's working remotely from a different city (she has a hybrid work model and don’t need the apartment at the moment). It seemed like a great setup—convenient, affordable, and a nice place to stay. But, as the title suggests, things have taken a bit of a creepy turn.

It started with some odd behavior from the landlord (our family friend). Several times now, during casual conversations, he’s mentioned details about private phone calls or discussions I’ve had inside the apartment. At first, I figured it was just a coincidence, but after it happened way too many times times (she knew not just general hunches, but in-depth information like private plans and schedule details that my parents didn't know), I started to suspect something was off. I initially wondered if there might be a hidden microphone somewhere for ""security"" purposes, but after a thorough inspection (with some help from friends), we didn’t find anything.

The real red flag came a few days ago. I was chatting with a friend on WhatsApp about meeting up for coffee in a completely different city. It was a casual conversation, nothing major. But today, out of nowhere, the landlord mentioned some upcoming work on the water system and advised me not to use water during that time. Then she casually added, “But that shouldn’t be a problem for you since you won’t be home then anyway.”

I froze.

I hadn’t told a soul about my plans to leave the apartment that day. I hadn’t even spoken about it out loud. My friend who I was chatting with doesn’t know the landlord, and no one else knew I’d be out of the apartment. When I pointed out what he’d said, she quickly changed the subject, but at that moment, I knew something was wrong.

Here’s where it gets even more suspicious. I recently found out that the landlord has a bachelor’s degree in computer science and is into programming (something I wasn’t aware of before). I’m using a router that she provided and set up with the internet contract. After this incident, I’m definitely switching to mobile data. But now I’m wondering—could she have hacked the internet connection? Is that how she knows so much? And it is a router ""problem"", can I disable it so I don’t have to burn through my precious mobile data for the rest of the week?

A few key points:

* I’m not a really tenant; I’m just staying here for 15 days because the family friend offered it while she's working remotely from a different city. I believe this is her primary residence, and she's letting me stay here for a nominal fee - since the place would've been empty anyway. Which makes the whole situation feel even weirder, to be honest.
* I do think spying on someone is unethical, but proving it is another story. Could it be that this is some WiFi setup she configured for herself, giving her access to monitor the network? I’m not exactly tech-savvy, but it seems plausible.
* The compensation for staying here is really minimal, but it does exist, and this whole thing with my private info was definitely not part of the deal. **Given the situation, I'd love to either disable this ""feature"", or have a little fun at her expense before I head out (and gather some evidence to prove it's happening)**

So, any ideas on how to deal with a nosy landlord before I head out? I was thinking about feeding her some harmless misinformation or sending my friends a bunch of cryptic, confusing messages (after letting them know in person, of course).

Thanks in advance for your creativity (or just any solutions)!",0,1728047378.0,techsupport,18,0.4,False

I prepared for about 2 weeks and I had to study for another test, but I think I made good use of the time I had. I used the GEL IELTS platform to do R and L mock tests and I found them to be harder than the ones from Cambridge books (7-7.5 on GEL IELTS mocks vs. 8-9 on Cambridge books). However, somehow I didn't really feel the actual test was way easier, maybe the questions were but the recordings and reading passages were somewhat comparable. 

For W, I prepared for 2 days by watching IELTS Advantage and IELTS Liz. IELTS Advantage has a free Task 2 writing course (called Essay Builder, IIRC) and it really helped me get the basics down: it's about writing clear and well-developed ideas. I think I messed up both tasks because I was running out of time because the keyboard was clunky and just awful. 

I didn't really prepare for S and I just watched band 9 videos on YouTube in the morning while having coffee before I left for the test. I totally flunked Part 2 because I didn't read the cue card well. But it wasn't as scary as I expected it to be.

1fvyoox,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeritageWear/comments/1fvyoox/top_new_releases_for_october_4/,Top New Releases for October 4,"As this past week wore on, it got quiet around the sub. Hopefully everyone is doing well and settling into the cooler autumn weather. Personally, I love this transitional time of year. This is when I inevitably start convincing myself that I probably need yet another jacket to cram into my already too-full closet. Or perhaps just one more flannel since I really haven’t found the “perfect one” yet. On that note, let’s get to some more new releases that caught my eye this past week…

I wanted to highlight this cool pair of ONI jeans last week, but opted for the N&F red core Elephant 13’s instead. The ONI 246-OLOL, essentially a double-olive pair of jeans, are unique enough that I don’t want to let them slip by unmentioned. Both the warp and weft use olive green dyed yarns to create a distinct and rich color. And in typical ONI fashion the fabric is packed with texture. As a big fan of jeans and military repro pants (which are often olive green), these appeal to both my inner jeans nerd and military repro nerd at the same time. Plus, these come in ONI’s “neat straight” cut, which I really appreciate - no strong taper here. A few shops are already sold out of the more popular sizes, but Hinoya and Blue Owl still have decent stock:

Every fall and spring Merz B Schwanen have a few new seasonal colors that are limited production. So if you like one, jump on it. This season’s first color is coffee. A dark, saturated brown which they are using on an array of pieces, from short sleeve and long sleeve T’s to henley’s. I think this color is perfect at adding a bit of an autumn vibe to your wardrobe. To me the long sleeve Henley is just screaming: apple picking, corn mazes, and pumpkin carving. You can always order direct from Merz B, but Withered Fig has just about every style in stock, so here’s a link to the henley on their site:

I’m sticking to the fall vibes for this last one. A number of unique colors of Jamieson’s of Shetland wool sweaters have been stocked over at Clutch Cafe. If you’re looking for a warm but breathable mid-weight knit to layer over a T or button down, it doesn’t get much better than a nice Shetland sweater, and Jamieson’s make flat-out gorgeous pieces. There are a few colors that really stand out to me, like this dog rose:

And buttermilk:

I’m going to have a tough time not picking up at least one of these myself. I see a lot of bright, jewel-tone Shetland sweaters out there right now, but the lighter, more subtle colors Jamieson’s has chosen for this season are just beautiful in my opinion.

Alright, what new releases caught your eye this week? It’s honestly hard to keep up, there is just a TON of stuff arriving in stores right now. Buzz Rickson’s jackets and hats and scarfs are showing up. Some playful new Beams Plus sweaters and corduroy pants have started arriving. Some of the new knitwear from Chamula looks absolutely insane this year. And everyone seems to be stocking up on socks from Chup and ROTOTO and such. If you need cold weather clothes, now is the time.

1fvynvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1fvynvw/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

**Why You’ll Love This Banana Bread Recipe**

This banana bread recipe is simple, delicious, and adaptable. Made with basic pantry ingredients, it’s a great way to use up overripe bananas, turning them into a moist, flavorful loaf that everyone will love. Plus, banana bread can be easily customized — whether you want to add chocolate chips, nuts, or even a swirl of cinnamon.

The best part? Banana bread is incredibly easy to make. Even if you’re a beginner in the kitchen, you’ll find that this recipe comes together quickly with minimal fuss, delivering excellent results every time.

**Ingredients for Classic Banana Bread**

Here are the basic ingredients you’ll need to make a loaf of banana bread:

* **3 ripe bananas** (mashed)
* **1/2 cup unsalted butter** (melted)
* **3/4 cup sugar**
* **2 large eggs**
* **1 teaspoon vanilla extract**
* **1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour**
* **1 teaspoon baking soda**
* **1/2 teaspoon salt**
* **1/2 teaspoon cinnamon** (optional, for added warmth)
* **1/2 cup chopped nuts or chocolate chips** (optional)

**Step-by-Step Banana Bread Recipe**

**Step 1: Preheat the Oven**

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.

**Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients**

In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork or potato masher until smooth. Stir in the melted butter until well combined. Add the sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract, and mix until the ingredients are fully incorporated.

**Step 3: Combine the Dry Ingredients**

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon (if using). Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a tougher texture.

**Step 4: Fold in Mix-ins**

If you’re adding any mix-ins like chopped nuts or chocolate chips, gently fold them into the batter.

**Step 5: Bake the Banana Bread**

Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 55–65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.

**Step 6: Cool and Serve**

Allow the banana bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and serving.

**Tips for Making the Best Banana Bread**

1. **Use very ripe bananas:** The riper the bananas, the better the flavor. Bananas that are heavily speckled or even black on the outside are ideal for this recipe.
2. **Don’t overmix the batter:** Stirring too much can develop the gluten in the flour, leading to a dense, rubbery loaf. Mix until the ingredients are just combined for the best texture.
3. **Customize your mix-ins:** Banana bread is incredibly versatile, so feel free to add whatever you like. Chocolate chips, walnuts, pecans, or even a swirl of peanut butter can take your banana bread to the next level.
4. **Test for doneness:** Every oven is different, so check your banana bread around the 55-minute mark. Insert a toothpick into the center — if it comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs, it’s ready.
5. **Storage tips:** Banana bread can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. You can also freeze it for longer storage — just wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing.

**Why This Recipe Works**

The combination of ripe bananas, melted butter, and a balance of dry ingredients creates a loaf that is perfectly moist and flavorful. The bananas provide natural sweetness, while the butter ensures a tender crumb. The addition of eggs gives structure to the bread, and a touch of vanilla rounds out the flavors. The option to include mix-ins like chocolate chips or nuts makes this banana bread both flexible and customizable to your taste.

**Serving Suggestions for Banana Bread**

* **For breakfast:** Serve a warm slice of banana bread with a pat of butter or cream cheese for a simple yet satisfying breakfast.
* **With coffee or tea:** Banana bread pairs wonderfully with a hot cup of coffee or tea, making it a perfect mid-morning or afternoon snack.
* **As dessert:** For a more indulgent treat, enjoy banana bread with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or drizzle it with a bit of caramel sauce.

**Conclusion**

**Banana bread** is a classic recipe that’s beloved for its moist texture, sweet flavor, and versatility. Whether you’re making it as a snack, breakfast, or dessert, this easy-to-follow recipe delivers delicious results every time. With just a few ingredients and minimal effort, you can whip up a loaf of homemade banana bread that’s sure to become a favorite in your household.

My doctor has prescribed dexies: 2x5mg, 3 times a day (30mg daily total). The first day I took it, it was already 11am when I got the pills so I decided to only take two doses so I wouldn’t go into the evening.

My first day was really good. I went to the gym and I felt almost euphoric. I didn’t have to sit in my car for 20-minutes doom scrolling before I went inside, and my “2-min rests” didn’t turn into 5 minutes, 7 minutes and so on. I was in and out way faster than normal. Also went to visit my sister and found I was way more chatty and bubbly than normal. Without sounding dramatic I kinda felt excited for my new life to start.

I felt fine all day but when it was time to go to bed (9pm) sleep just never came. I’ve always had loads of trouble switching off and actually closing my eyes, but once I do, I fall asleep quick and I’m a VERY deep sleeper. Yet last night I think I must have looked at the clock every 30 minutes for about 8 hours, which NEVER happens. I must have actually slept a bit because I did “wake up” and felt semi-rested when my alarm went off. My last dose was only at 3pm.

Today was Day 2 which did not feel as good. I woke up at 6am, had breakfast around 6:30 (worth noting this included a coffee) then took my first dose at 7. On the train to work, my Apple Watch said my heart rate was 110bpm just sitting still. Once I got to work I felt pretty all over the place, TOO energetic, like I had ADHD but in the opposite direction to normal. I was rambling to people, moving too fast, I genuinely felt like I was “high”. I’ve dabbled in caps at music festivals before and that’s what this felt like. On top of that I was gurning like crazy and sweating a fair bit for a 16°c day. My heart rate remained high all day. I didn’t feel like myself and I kept having this looming thought that a “crash” was coming (it didn’t).

I still took my 2nd dose 4 hours later at 11am, but shit happened at work and I wasn’t able to take my third dose until 4:30pm at which point I just decided to skip it because I want to be in bed by 9pm again and don’t want a repeat of last night. So both days I’ve only reached 20mg of the 30mg I’ve been prescribed.

Is 2 days too soon to think about lowering the dosage - does the feeling like I’m tweaking go away and my body just needs to get used to it over time? Or is 30mg/day simply too much for a first-time user???? Again, I haven’t actually taken 3 doses a day yet, I’m only reaching 20mg at the moment. Should I experiment with lowering this further tomorrow?

I am going to try some small changes tomorrow - I’m going to take my 1st dose the second I wake up rather than waiting until after breakfast, that way I can finish the full day at an earlier hour without worrying about sleep. I’m also going to delay my morning coffee until I get to work, once the first dose has been in my system for a couple hours already as I think I drank it too close to taking the pills which made me feel worse.

Metabolic panel came back with Alt 147 ast 83 bilirubin 1.6. Hit me like a ton of bricks. I had no idea what these numbers meant, only that they showed way off the chart on my report online. Primary care Doc gave me almost no information, just that I had to come in for more tests. Of course Google said I was about to d*e. Spent a few days in an anxiety spiral.. And then I found this sub. And right away I was able to put a plan together even before I had answers from my Dr. 

Of course I have followed up and done the tests my Dr has been suggesting.. HEP A B and C acute panels, Iron saturation, iron binding capacity, total iron and ferritin levels, PT-INR prothrombin time, celiac disease, Antinuclear antibody, smooth muscle antibody, Ceruloplasmin, and alpha-1-antitypsin tests. (all this to say LISTEN TO THE DOCTOR) 

I still have to do a routine ultrasound coming up... 

But all this being said, when I found this sub a week and a half ago I immediately cut out processed foods, high fat red meat, fast food, sugar, alcohol, fried food, even before I got any test results. 

I wake up and run a mile and half every morning, eat high protein low fat breakfast, lots of high fiber vegetables, tuna, grilled chicken, nuts, berries, etc. 

(Edit: also LOTs of black coffee) 

It was a wake up call that getting fast food for lunch and take out for dinner was not sustainable. For my wallet or body.. 

Im still early on in my journey but I wanted to show anyone freaked out that changes in diet and exercise really do work! 

I started seeing my GI about my liver (I have acid reflux so I already have a Gastro doc)

He did hepatic panel to just to make sure the enzymes aren't increasing for some reason. (he said that gallstones caught in a bile duct for example can cause alt/Ast to go crazy if it doesn't pass on its own) 

I was shocked at how much it's dropped in a week! 

Alt is now 120, ast is 78, bilirubin is 1.25..

Why does it seem like that is? ,"S.O.S. I need some opinions. There’s nothing I can really do here, which is why I worded it as opinion and not advice lol.

1 year ago I went on a date with a guy I met kinda of at out HS reunion, but we actually didn’t talk much there. I ended up messaging him over a month later a photo I took of him and his friends (seeing how he’d respond). He gave me his phone number and wanted to catch up in person, so we met for drinks when he came to town for the holidays We really hit it off. Sat there for 6 hours. He’d make commments about how beautiful and how cool I am. It was one of those movie moment dates…I could tell when I’d look away he was still staring at me. He asked if he could kiss me and I declined (wanted to, but didn’t want to do too much yet), so he asked for my hand and kissed me on the hand. It was all very romantic and sweet. He sent me texts immediately after for days about wanting to talk to me more and keeping contact. And I wanted those same things. At the time we lived 3hrs apart. We had plans to meet the next month and he started getting more distant and then told me he was dating someone else exclusively and it just happened. 
To say I was crushed is an understatement.

FFW ⏩ 1 year later: I actually live in the same city as him now. I’ve been here for 6 months. About 3 months in, I texted him to see how he is. I could tell by his texts he still had a girlfriend so I accepted we won’t be dating and let it go.

FFW ⏩ September he messaged me out of nowhere. Probably the LAST person I expected a text from. He asked how I was but then wanted to get drinks and so we met. Obviously single now. Again, it felt great. We left the fancy bar and went back to his apartment to eat pizza rolls and watch Futurama lol it felt nice being able to do both. Ofc things escalated with kissing (he asked if he could first again and RAN with it once I said yes.). We did everything BUT sex this night. I stood my ground to say the least. He was a bit grabby and it wasn’t pleasant. Like it hurt. I did say something. I questioned his experience level with the female body mentally for sure. 

We met for ice cream a few days later and chatted about the first night. He apologized if he took things too far and wanted me to feel okay. I made my intentions CLEARLY known. I want LTR and don’t want to just have sex to have sex. If we start off as friends I’d like it to grow into a romantic relationship and if sex is involved I assume that’s where it’s headed. He and I both said a lot, but I’ll note he made a comment about “figuring himself out”. I made the mistake of telling him about past relationships…one of those over sharing feelings. Other than that, he started at me and smiled at me and said all the sweet, nice things…it was a great date. We both talked a lot about movies and ideas of romance and romantic feelings too. Both on the same page about these things. 

3 days later we were texting/flirting and he invited me over. I went bc I wanted to. He said we can just hangout and watch Futurama if I’m comfortable doing only that. We did for a minute but I let it escalate. I wanted it to. I like him a lot. We do end up having sex and it was great. Total 180. He was gentle and kind and sweet and checked in with me often. Looked like he had tears in his eyes. He would stare into my eyes and tell me all the nice things still. I stayed over. It was nice.

We then decided to go to the museum 4 days later and also grab coffee. It was honestly a really nice actual date. He kept making comments of future things we could do together like reading in a park and even a movie he wanted to take me to see. I thought this was end game fr. 

We both surprisingly had the same taste in art, which was a nice touch as the arts are important to both of us in multiple ways. 

He drove me home and I invited him up. At first he wasn’t going to. He wanted to plan something for THIS week we are in right now (bc I was out of town over the weekend) and then he changed his mind, went home to get condoms and came back to me. 

We had the best sex I think I’ve ever had. It was very very passionate. LOTS of eye contact (which usually I avoid), but with him I don’t. We connected very well. I was just minding my business as he cuddled me after and he smiled to himself. I heard it and said “what?” And he said “nothing” but I pried and he said “it’s just…have you ever had an out of body experience? That’s how I feel right now. I feel like I’m looking at my own self and I’m here…then he said my name and smiled”. I told him I definitely didn’t see this on my 2024 bingo card, but I liked it too considering we weren’t exactly friends in high school. V random. 

We talked about fantasies. We talked about what this is a little. He obviously said we still were in beginning stages and obviously I said I wanted a friendship first so we were growing together. He said three times  throughout the month that we were building something together. He also said to me that although we aren’t 100% sure what was happening he said he promised that it wouldn’t end in my heartbreak. And he gave me an actual pinky promise and stamped it (something we started doing together to trust the other person…that was our Inception thing I guess). 


FFW ⏩ Last night. 1 week later. He said he needs to be alone and work on himself and that he no longer feels the spark, and sees me only as a potential platonic friend now. I feel gutted tbh. This came very much in a blindside kind of way for me. We literally went out to dinner and had a great time, he didn’t even say this until we were about to leave. He said we should take a month and do some thinking and growing and circle back when one of us wants to reach out. AT FIRST this mf said we should take a month, but that the ball was in MY court come November 1. I said no. I said that’s a cop out. I said we will see who reaches out to who, but you also can. If you feel a pull to reach out I’d rather you do it. 

But he also said if I’m the one that reaches out to him that it depends on the timing of my message… If he feels like he has done all of his thinking and that we can proceed with a friendship 100% that he will respond and tell me truly what he’s thinking… But if he doesn’t feel like he has done enough mental rewriting of me to do that yet he will say that. 

I told him I was disappointed, disgusted, and that his character didn’t turn out to be who I thought he was. 

He didn’t date but 1 girl ever seriously before (the one that happened after our first date), so idk if I triggered something or if he’s just THAT behind on experience that he’s going through his jackass phase at almost 30 for the first time. Idk. It sucks. We like similar things and always have something to talk about. He even agreed we have strong compatibility and chemistry and our intimacy was strong and passionate….but then yet says there’s not a spark now. Wtf…the spark is bs imo. He said that up until this past week of reflection, he really did want to try and pursue something romantically but right now he feels like he doesn’t have any bit of romance to offer to any woman and that it wouldn’t be fair to have this conversation months from now… I understand that he could still be hurt from his past relationship… But I just think it’s kind of wild to reflect and make the choice to pursue someone and then like you have one bad week or something and you just decide it was the relationship’s fault… Like I feel like this has nothing to do with me.

Sincerely, 

Confused in Kansas City 




TLDR; man I knew in high school and I connected and had a drink, we lived 3 hrs apart so he got a gf there and we stopped talking, I moved to the same city, he reached out to reconnect, we’ve had 5 dates and sex/fooling 3X. Always passionate and strong chemistry. He flipped the switch yesterday and said he is confused and wants to be alone and work on himself. He wants to take a month apart and if we circle back it would be as friends only. I’m disappointed in this. He was literally planning future stuff for us before doing what was already planned. He said up until this week he was fully wanting it. It switched. SOS.


Edited to note: he is a busy guy with a loaded schedule. His weekends are packed so we usually hang during the week. That’s fine. I’m very chill and understanding (I think he was expecting me NOT to be). He kept projecting onto me that eventually his schedule would bother me and that I would want something different and that he would feel bad that he can’t do what I want him to do with his schedule right now… So I’m kind of feeling like this is why his last relationship ended… 
And he’s acting out of fear That he will get attached to me and I’ll feel the same way, but I’m not 15 so I won’t. 

All I said was that I would need the occasional reassurance like any normal person would but I’m also very understanding that we’re almost 30 and we have schedules and we’re busy. He seemed taken aback. He did say his last relationship ended because they did not have the same communication style… And I think he’s thrown off because I’m playing chess to his immature approach to dating checkers. 

I don’t need to have the same communication style as someone to understand what they need and I ended it by just telling him that I have no choice but to respect his decision and give him the space that he clearly needs to work on himself and that it’s honestly probably a good idea he does that.

1fvy66j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1fvy66j/the_missing_things/,The Missing Things,"It started with the small stuff. My keys, my phone charger, even the remote for the TV—all seemed to vanish when I needed them most, only to turn up in strange places later. At first, I brushed it off. I live alone, so there’s no one else to misplace things. I figured I was just getting careless—overworked, maybe. But the more it happened, the more I started to wonder if something was off.

It began innocently enough. I’d come home from work, toss my keys on the kitchen counter like I always did, and go about my evening. But when I went to grab them the next morning, they wouldn’t be there. I’d scour the house, searching through drawers, behind cushions, even checking the car—nothing. Hours later, I’d find them in places I never would have put them: on the bathroom sink, under my bed, even inside the refrigerator once. I laughed it off the first few times. “I’m getting old,” I’d joke to myself. “Losing my mind.”

But then, it wasn’t so funny anymore.

The remote was the next to go. I’m not much of a TV person, but I’ll watch the occasional late-night movie. I distinctly remember setting the remote down on the coffee table after watching something—something forgettable. The next evening, the remote was gone. I tore the room apart. Cushions overturned, drawers opened, shelves emptied. Still nothing. Two days passed, and I found it under the bed. Not beside the bed, *under* it, deep in the corner, where I’d never have placed it.

I tried to ignore it, but the feeling crept up on me—a strange unease, like someone had been in my house. Like I wasn’t alone. But the doors were always locked, the windows shut. No signs of forced entry. No one else had a key. It was just me… wasn’t it?

Then my shoes went missing. The pair I wear every day. I came home from work, slipped them off at the front door like always, and went to bed. The next morning? Gone. I found them two days later, perfectly placed in my closet. The thing is, I never keep them in the closet. I’ve always left them by the door.

That’s when the paranoia started. I began wondering if maybe someone was coming into my house when I wasn’t there. Some weirdo slipping in, moving things around just to mess with me. I even considered setting up a camera, but something about the idea made me feel stupid. Who would break in just to hide my stuff? It had to be me, right? Maybe stress was getting to me. Maybe I was losing control.

But it got worse.

My wallet was the first major item to disappear. I remember leaving it on the kitchen counter before bed. When I woke up, it was gone. I tore the house apart—again. I checked the car, my jacket pockets, even the trash. Days passed, and I was ready to cancel my cards when it finally showed up—tucked under a pile of books on my nightstand. I didn’t put it there. I *know* I didn’t.

And then… my phone went missing.

I always kept it on the nightstand when I slept. Always. But one morning, it was gone. Just gone. I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t. I kept picturing someone creeping into my room while I slept, reaching for my phone, maybe standing there, watching me. I stayed up, pacing the house, listening for the faintest creak of the floorboards, watching the shadows move across the walls. But no one came.

It took a week to find my phone. I found it under the couch, wedged deep between the cushions, as if someone had deliberately pushed it there. My heart raced as I held it in my hand. This was no mistake. Someone was toying with me. But how? Why?

I finally gave in and set up cameras. Just two—one in the living room, one in the hallway facing my bedroom door. If someone was coming into my house, I would catch them. But that night, something even worse happened.

I woke up in the middle of the night to a sound—a soft, distant thud. I froze in bed, my heart pounding in my chest, straining to hear it again. And then it came—another quiet thud, like something being moved. I got up, grabbed the nearest object for protection—a broom, of all things—and crept through the house.

Nothing. No one.

But when I went to check the camera footage the next morning, the files were gone. Completely erased.

My blood ran cold. I didn’t sleep the next night. Or the night after that. I stopped eating properly. I didn’t trust myself anymore. Could it have been me all along? Moving things, hiding things, losing things? Was I erasing the footage without realizing it?

I stopped going to work. I stopped leaving the house entirely. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was inside, waiting for me to leave, waiting to rearrange my life, to push me further toward the edge.

Then, one morning, I woke up to find something on the kitchen counter—something I hadn’t seen in days.

My phone.

But it wasn’t the phone that terrified me. No, what chilled me to my core was the text message open on the screen.

**“Found it yet?”**

It wasn’t my text. It wasn’t my message.

And I realized then, with a sickening dread that I was never alone in the first place.

And maybe… I never would be.",2,1728045640.0,Ghoststories,1,1.0,False

The room is quiet now. The carers came early, as they always do. They tidied up, fussed over the bed, straightened the pillows, and left me with a soft smile. It’s a small room but tidy, everything in its place. The morning light is coming through the window, and there’s a promise of a fine day ahead. The air smells fresh, and the birds are starting their usual chatter outside. I let my breakfast settle—just coffee  and toast today—and sit back in my chair, watching the light shift on the wall.
There’s a kind of peace in the morning, before the nursing home stirs too much. The nurses make their rounds, gentle and quick, like they’ve done this a thousand times. They check on us, ask how we’re feeling, and go about their way, always with a kind word. There are activities planned for later—nothing too strenuous. I might join in, or I might not. I’ll decide when the time comes.
I hear the front doors creak, and a few of the relatives start to arrive. Some look cheerful, but I see the tears in their eyes, even if they try to hide them. We all pretend not to notice. That’s how it is. We don’t talk about the sadness much. I don’t mind the company, though. I’ve learned to take the day as it comes.
For now, I just sit here. The day stretches ahead of me, simple and calm. I’ve no need to rush. There’s a stillness in the air, and I breathe it in. The sun is getting warmer, the world outside moving along. It’s a good day, I think. Better than most.",5,1728045621.0,disability,0,1.0,False

My initial set of vaccines and the single booster I received in 2022 (?) were Pfizer. No side effects. 

My wife had been wanting me to get another covid booster so, after a ton of research, I decided to get the Novavax vaccine instead of Pfizer. I liked that it was a tried and true vaccine method, fewer side effects, and potentially had a longer and broader efficacy. 

Got the vaccine at CVS on Thursday around 10am. Easy peasy, and the tech was super jazzed someone actually requested Novavax. He said they’d only had a few people come in for it. Injection was smooth and he sent me on my way immediately. I grabbed some coffee on the way home and got right to work. 

The arm pain started almost immediately, but wasn’t too bad. A couple hours after injection, I started feeling extremely nauseated. I forced myself to eat lunch and the nausea went away. I also quit nicotine on Sunday, so I’ve been nauseated pretty much all week. 

Around 3:30pm, I was feeling great aside from my arm, so I went for a run. 

Around 7:30pm, the arm pain intensified to the point where it was impacting my whole arm. It made sleeping pretty difficult. 

Woke up this morning and the arm pain is still the same as it was last night, but it’s also spread. My fingers are tingling, my elbow joint feels like it’s on fire. I’ve got a really high pain tolerance (I literally broke several fingers once and assembled a treadmill before going to urgent care), but I actually had to take some pain killers this morning. 

Also, I’ve developed a weird side effect: I started having pelvic pain last night, as well. It’s not dissimilar to period cramping, but all of those organs were yeeted out of me 5 years ago. It’s lessened a bit this morning, but I had a heating pad on me last night.

1fvy2b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1fvy2b9/finding_a_spot_for_a_cafe_in_udaipur_random_blog/,Finding a spot for a cafe in Udaipur. [Random blog],"So around the middle of 2023 I was working with a friend who wanted to open a coffee cafe in Udaipur. We did some recon and came up with some insights. Nothing ever materialised but randomly came across this draft that I wrote at the time. Thought you people might find this interesting. (I know it's a bit pretentious). Lemme know if it violates community guidelines.

The Cozy Café Chronicles: Our Quest for the Perfect Coffee Shop Spot in Udaipur (Day 1)  
  
Hello, fellow coffee lovers and adventure-seekers! Let me paint a picture for you: imagine the open road stretched out before you, the windows of your car rolled down, the warm, arid air of Rajasthan blowing through your hair, as you and your friend journey towards the enchanting city of Udaipur. A 400+ kilometer road trip, all in the name of the ultimate quest: to find the coziest, quaintest location for a specialty coffee café.  
  
The journey from Jaipur to Udaipur took us a good 5 hours, and, let's just say, we might've gotten a bit too enthusiastic with the accelerator, earning ourselves a speeding ticket. (Note to self: even in the pursuit of good coffee, always obey traffic laws!)  
  
I'm no barista, mind you. But I'm what you'd call a coffee enthusiast. I can tell a good brew from a bad one, but beyond that, my knowledge is pretty basic. We're heading to meet a friend who works at a coffee shop cum co-working space called Jajam. She's promised to meet us after 7, but she's left us in suspense about where she works. So, we reach Udaipur around 3 pm, with a good few hours to kill. What better way to spend it than doing a little coffee shop reconnaissance?  
  
We start with a random search on Google Maps and - would you believe it - the universe has a funny way of working things out. We end up at none other than Jajam! Walking into the café, it felt like we had stumbled upon a hidden treasure. The place was set up in an old rustic house that oozed vintage charm. The coffee was decent, the food good. We ordered a croissant pesto and chicken sandwich, and mashed potatoes with miso-glazed caramel mushrooms. I mean, those names alone were an adventure to say out loud!  
  
The chicken sandwich lived up to its fancy name, but the potatoes were a bit of a hit and miss. We met our friend and had a great chat about the café scene in Udaipur. The food items seemed slightly overpriced, but with the ambient, homely environment, it could be justified.  
  
Next on our list was Aosa, a brand-new place that had opened just 10 days ago. It's Udaipur's first roastery, a grand operation with aesthetic corners that would make any Instagrammer squeal with joy. The bakery items were top-notch, though the coffee felt a bit lacking. They're new though, they'll get the hang of it.  
  
Both Jajam and Aosa are located in Panchwati, a locality we thought was quite posh. We suspected it was frequented by the upper-middle class (a quick Google check confirmed our suspicions).  
  
Our next stop was Jheel’s Ginger Coffee Bar & Bakery, situated near the enchanting Pichola Lake. The journey there was quite an experience - had to park our car about 500 meters away due to traffic restrictions, and navigated through the narrow lanes on foot. The area had a different vibe, with numerous eateries lining the streets.  
  
The café had a breathtaking view of the lake, with the city palace reflecting in the water bathed in yellow light. It was a sight to behold. But the food? Well, let's just say the fancy names on the menu didn't quite match the taste.  
  
Udaipur is certainly developing a taste for specialty coffee, but the options are still limited. Now, from what we experienced so far on day one, we're stuck with a conundrum: do we choose Panchwati, with its posh, local crowd and potential for regulars? Or near the must-visit Pichola Lake with the promise of great walk-ins but likely to be overlooked by locals?  
  
Well, the jury is still out on that one. We're off to get a more detailed insight into these two areas, visiting more cafés, and chatting up with the locals. After all, every cup of coffee has a story to tell, and we're just getting started on ours.  
  
Stay tuned for more of our caffeinated adventures in Udaipur!

1fvy26n,https://www.reddit.com/r/aproyal/comments/1fvy26n/the_chair/,The Chair,"We found it on the roadside at the end of a cul-de-sac. Just sitting there in an open patch of grass. That meant free, according to my wife, Clare.  

Apart from that fact, I didn’t see what the appeal was. The upholstery was faded, the black sunflower print worn out into blobs of grey. The beige fabric was frayed at the edges of the stitching attached to its cheery wood frame.  She could never get that spot out of the seat cushion. I always wondered why. 

 Clare experimented with the placement of the chair for a long time. Some days I’d find it in the corner of the study, other days it would be sitting in the family room. We’d watch movies together, her eyes flickering shut, her head resting against the padding. Her hand in mine. It was ugly, but if she loved it, I didn’t mind. I was no interior decorator myself.

One evening when Clare was working, I left the cartoons running and exited the living room. It was only for a second to shut off the burner, the kettle whining atop the hot stove. I heard the thud and came running.

Our daughter, Harper, was unresponsive, lying in a pool of blood. She was just learning to walk. I figured she had tried to climb one of the armrests and fell, hitting her head on the edge of the coffee table. It would have been quite the fall, but it wasn’t a stretch. 

Clare rushed to the E.R., but there was nothing they could do. She had lost too much blood. 

“I’m going to get rid of it,” Clare promised, in tears. Bad juju, we both agreed. She could hardly be in the same room as it anymore because it reminded her of what happened.  

The last place I found it was in the basement. I had hardly noticed it at first because my eyes were fixed on her. 

Clare’s dusty footprints were on the seat where she had reached up and tied the noose. Her limp body twisted and turned, her lips bloated and purple. Her stare was gone.

The chair stood under her, angled towards me. I approached slowly, rubbing my fingers along the arms. Fresh slashes were carved into the wood. In the hollow trenches were tiny speckles of blood. 

The stain on the cushion had spread, dark as a pool of tar.

\*\*\*

The chair has found its way to our bedroom now. 

Some nights when the house is quiet, I swear I catch glimpses of them. I’ll blink and Clare’s head will be nestled against the headrest, Harper cradled in her arms. 

All of us, together. 

And in the darkness, I know.

1fvy0s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fvy0s0/aitah_that_my_jealousy_is_getting_in_the_way/,AITAH that my jealousy is getting in the way? ,"I (F32) got given an amazing new job nearly 2 years ago with everything i wanted including a chsnce to get a degree. Sadly a monthly later before I even had chance to start I had to reject due to nursery fees going up and family couldn't really help with childcare. My partner worked full time too.. I was devastated and it really got me down. 

That year wasn't the best after that. I was given other jobs but due to childcare issues and costs again I couldn't go for them. I'm in a job I really don't enjoy anymore after 11 years and desperate for something where I'd be gaining more in terms of knowledge and qualifications. 

At the start of this year, my partner (M32) went for a new job and after a lengthly process he got it. It's on the railway so better pension and huge increase in his wages from the last job. During this process, I asked him again and again to find out more about his shifts. He said he would but never got back to me & he was glad he took this job for us. By this point he had accepted the position and was ready to start the long training programme. 

This is where my bitterness started. After looking into his job I realised I'm not going to be able to work my shifts around him (hospital worker x 3 shifts a week). I couldn't do days due to me not finishing until 8pm and if he was on lates we couldn't always have someone for our children both now in school (2xF - 7+4). My nights I could do but if he was on earlies our children would have to stay somewhere etc etc. So I have had to drop my hours to just 2 nights a week taking my wages down by over £400 a month. I can bank extra shifts but with his training im struggling to fit any in and find childcare for our children.. 

I'm gutted. We pay equal amounts towards the bills and I've had to decrease that and him increase because I can't afford it any more. I've had to give up some hobbies I can't afford and also give up something as simple as going for a coffee with friends because my fear is running out of money. He keeps saying his money is my money but realistically it isn't. I now have to ask for money to pay for things and I hate it as I've never had to. It annoys me that now he brags about how much he earns when I'm  struggling and literally living penny to penny. 

I'm jealous he has has had this opportunity when I should have been nearly 2 years into my own training and I had to give it up because I had noone to help me but yet I've given up so much for him. Im bitter when he goes out because he can afford to and I can't. I'm bitter when he discusses his work and how great it all is atm. I can't stand listening to him.

1fvy0qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticParents/comments/1fvy0qn/a_little_vent/,A little vent ,"Mainly bc I'm too exhausted for a full sized one. 

We have had our house under construction for 3 months. It was supposed to be 3 weeks and it has been three fucking months. Today is supposed to be the last day, and the foreman is acting like everything is delightful and glorious and keeps asking if I'm going to give a good review. Like, my dude in brotherhood... The work has been solidly B- and the communication has been a spectacular failure. 

They have multiple days of no work, then days that are 12 hours long, and we have done our best to manage bc we need it done. We have tried to advocate for our schedule and our child, but by the time things went off the rails our house wasn't in a position for us to fuck around. We just needed to get it done. 

Theoretically, today is the last day, but we are all so fucking fried and overstimulated it's hard to celebrate. We are all ND, and so very done. 

The inability to plan from day to day, or even within a single day, has gotten me closer to self harming than I've been in years (thank Gods for my therapist). 

My child is particularly noise sensitive, and he just stops sleeping after a full day of work even with his meds. He fell out at 830pm last night and work up at 2am. Yep. This is happening 2-3 times a week now. I just accidentally left my car running, walked a block to get coffee, and walked back wondering why I couldn't get the damn thing to start. Woops. 

I don't really have anyone to bitch to be it's such a privilege to have the means to do this Reno in the first place. And I totally get that. Which is why I'm here. But it just sucks to have everyone be ""oh my gosh are you so excited about the renovation"" and smile/nod when I really want to sit down and ugly cry for a few days. 

I knew this would be hell, and I knew it would probably take longer than anticipated, but this on top of restarting school for the year just has us all completely destroyed. Oof. Thank for you listening. It feels a little better to scream into the void. ",3,1728045169.0,AutisticParents,0,1.0,False

V60 would often stall on me, kalita seems much more stable and reliable but I am confused with the Ode gen2 grind settings (gen2 burrs) and some results I just had.

Just brewed onyx Uganda Long Miles Lunar Station Natural, TWW water at 200/202F.    
First I did 20g to 300g, grind setting 5 and finished around 3:30 with three pours, waiting each pour to almost drain.      
Then I did the recommended onyx recipe, 15g to 225g in three pretty fast pours but on grind setting 3. I was sure this would completely stall and be unbearably bitter, much too fine.

Instead it finished draining around 2:30 and was a pretty intense cup with more fruity and especially juicy,  vibrant notes. Not really much more bitter. I think it was overall a much better cup.

I would have assumed 3 on the Ode gen2 is finer than even their recommended pour over settings? And if setting 5 with 300g of water just finishes at 3:30, then surely a bit less water but setting 3 would stall... instead it worked out great.

WTF? Is there some ""magic"" to fast-consecutive pours without waiting for it to drain, then pour again? Less fines clogging? Or just the smaller amount of water allowing for much finer grinding? Or this Uganda coffee barely produces fines???

I am really wondering if I have been under-extracting for too long... the longer I been playing around with pour-over, the more confusing it seems to get lol!! and the worse I fear I am at dialing in and getting all extracted that the coffee is offering!",2,1728044702.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

1fvxuo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1fvxuo3/it_was_her_favorite_chair/,It was her favorite chair,"We found it on the roadside at the end of a cul-de-sac. Just sitting there in an open patch of grass. That meant free, according to my wife, Clare.  

Apart from that fact, I didn’t see what the appeal was. The upholstery was faded, the black sunflower print worn out into blobs of grey. The beige fabric was frayed at the edges of the stitching attached to its cheery wood frame.  She could never get that spot out of the seat cushion. I always wondered why. 

 Clare experimented with the placement of the chair for a long time. Some days I’d find it in the corner of the study, other days it would be sitting in the family room. We’d watch movies together, her eyes flickering shut, her head resting against the padding. Her hand in mine. It was ugly, but if she loved it, I didn’t mind. I was no interior decorator myself.

One evening when Clare was working, I left the cartoons running and exited the living room. It was only for a second to shut off the burner, the kettle whining atop the hot stove. I heard the thud and came running.

Our daughter, Harper, was unresponsive, lying in a pool of blood. She was just learning to walk. I figured she had tried to climb one of the armrests and fell, hitting her head on the edge of the coffee table. It would have been quite the fall, but it wasn’t a stretch. 

Clare rushed to the E.R., but there was nothing they could do. She had lost too much blood. 

“I’m going to get rid of it,” Clare promised, in tears. Bad juju, we both agreed. She could hardly be in the same room as it anymore because it reminded her of what happened.  

The last place I found it was in the basement. I had hardly noticed it at first because my eyes were fixed on her. 

Clare’s dusty footprints were on the seat where she had reached up and tied the noose. Her limp body twisted and turned, her lips bloated and purple. Her stare was gone.

The chair stood under her, angled towards me. I approached slowly, rubbing my fingers along the arms. Fresh slashes were carved into the wood. In the hollow trenches were tiny speckles of blood. 

The stain on the cushion had spread, dark as a pool of tar.

\*\*\*

The chair has found its way to our bedroom now. 

Some nights when the house is quiet, I swear I catch glimpses of them. I’ll blink and Clare’s head will be nestled against the headrest, Harper cradled in her arms. 

All of us, together. 

And in the darkness, I know.
