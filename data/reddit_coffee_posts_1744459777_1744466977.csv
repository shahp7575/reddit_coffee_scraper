I'm a 21 year old bisexual guy from Norway. I sing and song write as a hobby.  I come off as a rather stereotypical/ordinary guy to most, which seems to land me in strange situations with women, who assume that I'm sexually/romantically interested in them whenever I'm friendly. My love language growing up has always been verbal. I'm not very physically attentive nor do I initiate it much, but through language I'm very expressive and often tell the people I love that I love them (including to my hetero male friends). Naturally this shines whenever I write or sing music. 

I recently wrote a song for a childhood friend who so happens to be a lesbian. She presents very butch which in some ways removes any suspiciousness that I'm interested in her (so it seems..) Most people think our friendship is odd because Lesbians and male friendships don't seem all that common. She's been in my life since I was a young child. For her birthday coming up soon, I wrote a song for her that I intend to play for an audience at the coffee lounge where she works. The song is titled in Norwegian ""In The Movies"". In the song I reference how everytime we're around each other we get lost in our own adventures, and things seem so dramatic, just like in the movies. How we fight sometimes like siblings and how much we can annoy one another, but in the end I love her. I use the hook ""I love you"" several times throughout the song. The song is played acoustically, and I have a soft singing voice. People that have heard the song have commented on how it sounds really sentimental and like a love song. I wanted it to be sentimental because it's a song paying homage to our friendship. I enjoy writing about my friendships oppose to my love life, and I have written songs about my friendships with my hetero male friend before to whom I love as strictly brothers. 

Well that hasn't seemed to land well with her other friends (she has a lot of queer female friends that I'm familiar with but aren't necessarily friends with me). The feedback I've gotten from them is that it comes off like a love song, it's weird, and will embarass her if I played this song to her in public. Her girlfriend will be there and the concerns are thar this will also make her g.f uncomfortable. How I should perhaps save it for another time or change the melody because it's too soft (romantic sounding). 

The only people who have cautioned me about singing and composing this song have been queer women, so perhaps there's just something I'm missing here?

I opened wand and ran it and a rush brown water came out the wand. Then it returned to clear.

But something is wrong now!  Seems like normal flow out head without coffee in it, and seems like normal flow out wand for water and steam, but when I pull my usual double shot it's clearly not pushing water through normally and I'm ending with half of what I'd usually pull.

Did I blow a pump or something?  I've never opened her up or learned how she works.

1jxi136,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jxi136/is_myf19_boyfriendm21_sick_of_me/,Is my(f19) boyfriend(m21) sick of me?,"So about 2 weeks ago I noticed my boyfriend being distant.

The TLDR is that we’ve been together for almost 9 months, and he’s just been tired/low energy every time he’s seen me. He says this is the busiest time of his life, which I believe, but also hung out with his friends directly after seeing me (which I wouldn’t have a problem with usually, it’s just that he made it a point to emphasize how he’s getting tired and how he should go home, but then went out and hung out again directly after us seeing each other. Among other things, which you can see in the original post. 

We finally had a proper date yesterday, as we haven’t had a chance to get dressed nicely and go to a nice restaurant in like a month and a half. So I was hoping this date would alleviate any of the worries I had. When he first picked me up I noticed he was quiet in the car, so I asked him “are you tired” with a smile and he laughed a little and said “yeah”.

About ten mins goes by and I ask him “you’re just tired right, there’s not something else that’s wrong?” And I think he was a little shocked by this question because he quickly turned to me and said “what?” And I repeated my question. He clarified that no nothings wrong he just doesn’t feel talkative some days. I said that’s fine, I don’t mind if you don’t feel like talking, I just wanna make sure theres not another reason why you don’t feel like talking. He confirmed that nothing was wrong and we continued on our way. 

We ate our food (we went to a nice Italian restaurant) and then we got dessert together at a coffee shop. I was hoping after we ate he would get more energetic, but if anything it made him more tired. So while we were sitting playing with each other’s hands, I asked him, “do you always enjoy spending time with me?” And he gave me a “yeah” response which I did not like. It was like a quick yeah, not upbeat or anything, and I think this just made me sadder. 

I didn’t say anything for a second, then I addressed the way he responded, and was like “that did not sound like a confident yeah”. He laughed after I said that and made a joke about how he said it, which I assume means he recognized how weird that “yeah” sounded, but I still don’t understand why he responded like that. 

I kinda continued and then asked him, would you tell me if something was wrong, and he’s like “yeah of course, do you feel like you did something wrong?” Which I also hated. Because why did he say the words “you did something wrong” rather than just saying “do you feel like something’s wrong” it felt accusatory for no reason. I said “no! But people can have problems together and not work out even if no one did something explicitly wrong” and then the conversation faded a bit and he ended it by saying I know how he is, and that he would always always tell me if something’s wrong. (Which is true, he is direct about that stuff). 

Eventually, we went back to the car, drove back, and I silently leaned on him for almost the entire car ride, while he yawned a bunch. When he dropped me off, he said he can probably see me again to get coffee before I go back to school, which made me feel a bit better, but not much. 

Other details (good and bad):
He’s consistently been very gentleman-ey
He is very sweet over text and clarifies that he wants to see me 
He rarely says I love you first, it’s usually me saying it and him responding
He’s been the first one to break off from hugs lately 

I don’t know what to do, I don’t wanna come off as super insecure, but I can’t help but feel insecure lately. I’ve been rereading our old chats lately, from when we first got together, and soemthing about them just seems so innocent and fun/flirty that his behavior now just doesn’t seem to match. I can’t tell if it’s actual changed behavior, or just settling more into the relationship and not feeling the need to be as corny together. Reading these chats makes me sad but it’s also addicting, it’s like I’m reliving our moments. Don’t get me wrong, our recent chats are still great, and he’s very sweet, but something about the older ones is just so much more energetic.

Hey fellow travelers,

I’m heading to Goa from April 20th to 26th and wanted to ask for some tips. I’ll be staying in Morjim initially, but not sure if I should stick around that area the whole time or explore other parts of North Goa to stay. I’ll be solo from the 22nd onwards, so looking to make the most of it.

I’m taking the Vande Bharat both ways, so that part’s sorted. Now, for the rest:

-Any solid bike rental companies you recommend? Preferably ones that allow pick-up in one spot and drop-off in another?

-What are some cool, not-too-touristy places to chill, read, or just vibe out around North Goa? I’m okay with secluded spots too—honestly prefer them over crowded beaches.

-I’m skipping South Goa this time—cab prices and travel time are a pain.

-Any must-try cafes, beach shacks, flea markets, or events happening that week?

-And if anyone here’s from Goa and doesn’t mind showing a solo traveler around or grabbing a drink/coffee, that’s a huge bonus.

Would love to hear any local hacks or things I shouldn't miss. Thanks in advance!

A lot has happened 😭

She got sober. That’s the first thing. The impossible thing. She told me she was going to stop drinking, and I didn’t believe her,not really. I mean, I wanted to. But I’d seen her drink like the world owed her something. I’d watched her drown herself in alcohol and I just didn’t believed her because it was almost like a part of her.But the she just stopped.

She started therapy. Like real therapy. Weekly sessions. She told me she hated it. Told me her therapist was annoying,but she kept going. She said it made her feel like she'd been underwater for years, and suddenly someone was opening the windows. That maybe she'd never seen herself clearly (or something like that). She said things like that sometimes were Pretty intimate but somehow managed to be distant.

And I tried to stay away. I really did 😭

I started going out again. Reconnecting with my friends. My life looked normal. Like something out of someone else’s routine. There were group photos and cafés and loud dinners, I started going to parties again, and simply going out almost everyday because someone else wasn’t stealing my time.I posted Instagram stories almost every day, like the usual.She never posted anything because she didn’t even knew how to use instagram which I still find stupid. But she’d reply sometimes. Just emojis. That laughing one, the one with the tears. the kind of “texts” your mom sends when she doesn’t really know how else to talk online. It felt sterile. Empty. Like she didn’t know how to reach me anymore.

BUT THEN,she started calling me a lot.

She’d talk about strange things,how the wind moved past her building at night, how the streetlights flickered,how therapy made her remember things she hadn’t thought about in years. She never said anything sweet. Never affectionate. But she asked. Asked if I’d been sleeping. If I’d been eating. If I was writing. She told me she’d read what I recommended her. That she’d listened to Jeff Buckley and liked him. That part almost made me cry. About how sometimes she’d watch me sleep and think, “fuck, I’ve ruined this too.” We didn’t talk about us, not directly. But it was there. It always was.

And I didn’t really wanted to but my emotions made me, I knew it wasn’t healthy to get close to her again and I was genuinely trying to forget about her, but the difference was that I simply couldn’t because she was actually insanely important for me no matter how aloof and bitter she was.

Eventually, we started seeing each other again. Not dating. Just lingering. Hours spent in half-spoken conversations. Dinners that turned into long drives. Car rides that ended in silence. She told me about her childhood,sharp fragments. It wasn’t bad, she said. Just distant. Secure but cold. No major trauma and a healthy life.She said she didn’t know why she ended up the way she did. That maybe it was something chemical.That she used to think she'd be dead by thirty. Not because she wanted to die,just because she didn’t care and thought that alcohol killed people a lot earlier than they were supposed to.

Sometimes she’d say things like, “I don’t believe in people,” or “I think I don’t really need company to be fulfilled” and then laugh, like it was just a joke. But it wasn’t.

She was lucid. Focused. But still herself. Still cold and cutting. Still brutally honest in a way that made my chest tighten. But something was quieter in her now. Like the screaming had gone inward.

Okay so then,something very heartbreaking happened, it had been some weeks,everything good. Then one night, I went to her place. And there was a man there. A short, unremarkable man. Indifferent by me and just stupid looking. His presence hit me like a slap because I didn’t knew what the actual hell he was doing in there,he wasn’t repairing something and looked way to comfortable to be visiting and so just got weirded out,so I entered and I greeted him and then I reached her and asked her who the hell was that 🥱🥱???

She told me to leave. Said it sharply, like I was interrupting something. I went home and cried for hours,I started making up all the possible scenarios ever and assuming they were true.

Later, she showed up at my door,the normal, but when we were calm and just ready to have a conversation,she looked at me a bit serious and said,“That man’s my husband.” Just like that. Flat tone. No drama. Like she was telling me about an old coworker.

Turns out they’d been married for years but hadn’t lived together in a long time. He was in Georgia. She had moved states away. They hadn’t spoken. They hated each other. Cold war silence. But suddenly, he decided he wanted to “try again,” and showed up at her door with his bags. She said she let him stay because she was “too busy to file the papers.”

She told me this while eating fries in my living room. Like it was just gossip. Like it didn’t matter. Like she wasn’t telling me she’d been sharing space—her space—with a man who used to sleep beside her.

I broke. No, really. I broke.

I started crying, couldn’t stop. Something primal just took over. I barricaded the door with couch cushions. As if I could trap her there, keep her from leaving, keep her from going back to him. My mind spiraled: I couldn’t survive her,MY WOMAN, being that close to anyone else,I couldn’t imagine it. Couldn’t bear it. She screamed at me. She slapped me. Called me pathetic. And that I was crazy.

And I just cried. Silent. Shaking. I couldn’t even speak. She said, “Let me fucking go.” I didn’t. She repeated it, louder this time. Her fists clenched. And all I could do was sob.

I don’t know what came over me. I trowed myself at her and kissed her, I wrapped my arms around her neck while my heels lingered in my feet, I pulled her down gently. She kissed me back very harshly. I don’t know if her back was hurting lmao,but she grabbed my shoulders and sat me down on the couch that was impeding her to go. We ended up on the couch, tangled, desperate, half-mad with pain, she cupped my face and roughly grabbed my hair,she wasn’t entirely on top of me but her weight was crushing me, and not only could I feel her mouth perfectly but also grease because of my lipstick, it felt like all my senses were high.

And I have tried enough things to know what I like and whatnot, there are even a lot more things to explore but I know that THAT kiss was probably one of the best things I ever had in my life.

She bit my lip. I cried out and screamed in high bitch out of Inertia. When I pulled back, there was blood in my mouth, I don’t know how. She looked down and wiped away the blood with her thumbs,I don’t know if she felt guilty or indifferent but she left.

We didn’t talk for weeks after that.But I was so mad and so so soooo disappointed that I promised myself I wouldn’t talk to her ever again,that if she tried to reach me I would snap at her.And I never mentioned too much about her with my friend groups but I was actually so upset and crazy that I just ranted about it to everyone and they were all mad too. it was childish but I couldn’t react in any other way, I just loosed my mind for some moments.

Until one afternoon,she just showed up at my house.

Didn’t knock. Just walked in (she still had a key). I was by the pool just floating and having coffee. She found me there and said, “What the fuck are you doing?” Like I’d insulted her. “Go get dressed.” I obeyed (I liked it).Her voice made my spine straighten. She was furious,God knows why.

When I came back downstairs, she was leaning against my fridge. I said nothing. She grabbed my arm and pulled me outside. Took me to her car.

I asked where we were going. She didn’t answer.

We drove in silence. She lit a cigarette. Rolled the window down. Eventually, we reached the beach (we are in Florida so it wasn’t hard work lol). We sat in the sand for hours. Just listening. Watching. Talking.

She told me about that man,her husband,and how he tried to sleep in her bed the first night. She locked herself in the bathroom until morning. Said he cried once. She felt nothing. Said she wanted a beer that night. Just one. Said she held the bottle for an hour and couldn’t open it. And all the things she told me about her marriage were genuinely cold and I thought about how all of our situation was almost movie-like and how her marriage was so brutally real and unsatisfying, it was a harsh contrast.

She told me she thought about us as teenagers. Wondered how different life would be. She told me about her job. Hated him. Hated how exhausted she always felt. She talked and talked and talked.

AND NOW HERE IS THE CRAZY PART

And then, just like that, while we were laying and I was trying to act all cute and calm even tho I wasn’t, she had paid for numerous coffe’s and I was actually having a great time, giggly and fuzzy—she pulled out a ring.

She just turned around and told me she didn’t want anyone else walking into my house. That she didn’t want anyone else touching me. That she didn’t care if I hated her. That she didn’t care if she didn’t deserve me. That she just wanted me to be hers. Permanently.

She didn’t say “I love you.” She never does. But she said things that meant it. Things I can’t repeat. Things too specific, too real. Things you only say when you mean it and when it’s already too late.

She grabbed my hand and put the ring in my finger, it fitted me perfectly and she knew what I liked, it was heavy,elegant and looked like pure gold, the design was insanely perfect and I loved it. She knew that I loved it. I couldn’t speak. I WAS GENUINELY SHOCKED,I stared. She waited.

I wanted to say YES, I wanted to tell her how much I worshipped her,loved her,adored her, and the thought of us living together forever was almost like a “the little house on the prairie” episode to me.

But I couldn’t. I couldn’t even breathe and It was sort of stupid to say yes from a logical approach, I tried to think sometime, and yeah it wasn’t a good idea.All I could do was whisper, “I have to think.”

She scoffed.

“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”

“Jesus Christ. Get your shit together. Marry me.”

She got up. Brushed sand off her knees. Didn’t look at me.

“Look, I get it” she said (it was weird because she wasn’t that comprehensible,not at all). “Think.”

And I didn’t knew what else to do or say,so I got up too.We drove back in silence.

I haven’t given her an answer yet.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.

I think about it every day 😔 I don’t want to loose her but marrying her is also insane despite how happy it would made me. JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK PLS, Maybe this sounds stupid but I genuinely can’t think clearly and I’m very overwhelmed.",1,1744466222.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I would describe this as “Vanilla that is kept in a smoky jar and close it.”

🍮 Scent Profile: 

* Opening: Praline, saffron, and pear — warm like burnt sugar.

* Heart: Bulgarian rose — soft through thick vanilla cream.

* Dry-down: Vanilla sugar, oud, white musk, cashmere wood. So, creamy, cozy, with a subtle smoky touch.

Minimal — just enough to give depth without overpowering the vanilla.

🕯️ Overall Feel:
Sweet yet smoky. Creamy but never cloying. Think: dessert with secrets. A sophisticated gourmand for cool weather lovers.

⏳ Longevity & Projection:

* Lasts: 6–8 hours

* Projects: Strong for the first few hours, then turns intimate.

🧣 Best For:

* Fall, winter, early spring

* Date nights, luxe lounging, candlelit evenings, for professional settings like during meetings.

1jxhuzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/lymphoma/comments/1jxhuzh/my_proven_anticonstipation_regimen/,My proven anti-constipation regimen,"Summary:

* Diagnosis: Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma
* Chemo regimen: A+AVD (or AAVD)
* Treatment stage: Chemo 12 of 12 on 2025-04-14

Likely Cause of Constipation

* Generic: Vinblastine
* Brand name: Velban 
* Vinblastine is the V in A+AVD
* Quote from ChemoCare drug info: “This medication will cause constipation.”

Daily Regimen

* Breakfast:  10 oz of half-caf / half-decaf coffee (bowel stimulant)
* Breakfast: Generic MiraLAX 17g with 4 oz apple juice
* Breakfast: L-Glutamine one scoop with 4 oz prune juice (L-Glutamine for neuropathy / nerve health)
* Breakfast: Generic Metamucil orange flavor with sugar - one rounded tbsp with 4 oz water - Avoid “no sugar” version if you are sensitive to artificial sweeteners.
* Supper: Senokot extra strength 17.2mg pill - IMPORTANT:  Only active ingredient is Sennosides 17.2mg.  Avoid other versions of Senokot that add other substances.
* Daily: Generic Ensure Plus 350 cal.  Started with two daily and dropped to one daily once regimen began working.

Regimen Notes:

* Constipation was a constant misery in early stage chemo until I settled on this regimen.
* Half-caf coffee stimulates my bowels without overdoing the caffeine which makes me shaky.
* Metamucil dose:  Quickly lowered daily dose from 3 rounded tbsp to 1 rounded tbsp based on gas/bloating side effect 
* Regimen concept:  Keep body full at all times of gentle, slow-acting laxatives:  Metamucil, MiraLax, prune juice, Senokot 
* Taking three powders with three different-tasting liquids helps me remember what I’ve taken if I get interrupted during the morning dosing.  That’s apple juice, prune juice, and water with orange-flavored Metamucil.  (If you’re not taking L-Glutamine, your prune juice will not include a powder.)
* Regimen metric:  Judge success by by number of CSBMs = Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movements.  This is what formal medical studies count.  Should not be straining to go.  Impulse to go should be spontaneous.  Full emptying should be daily or every other day at the latest.
* Keystone med:  Metamucil is the brand name for psyllium husk, but I take the generic version.  This miracle supplement sweeps your large intestine, gathering up the poop into large clumps and automatically adjusting poop’s moisture content to make it easy to pass. Metamucil is also prescribed for diarrhea because of its amazing ability to adjust poop’s moisture content up or down and clump poop for larger BMs less often.
* Keep eating:  My oncologist put me on the “gobble diet” because I lost so much weight.  Very hard to keep gobbling when food is going in and nothing is coming out.  Once regimen is going strong, eat through the occasional missed BM.  The pressure of the additional food seems to encourage the BM to come the next day.  Ensure is your friend when solid food seems too much to cope with.

I made the same post for Uruguay, Montevideo, but I am also considering Buenos Aires.I was wondering if there is anyone here who can help me to tell me what it's like being a transwoman in Argentina, especially Buenos Aires.

I know on paper, it's great. The laws etc. are all progressive. But are the people? Because I live in Portugal currently (I'm not Portuguese, but speak it fluently) and although the laws look super liberal and progressive, the reality is very very different. This is an extremely conservative country with 20% of the population being far-right and agreeing with the Trump-loving CHEGA party and hating on ""woke"" every chance they get. Then another 30-40% are centre-right and will probably swing further right at the drop of a hat, because they value ""traditional Christian family values"".

That leaves a small percentage of really liberal people, who are my friends circle. But even they, the allies, they are telling me that because I am a business owner, I cannot be openly trans because people will stop coming to my shop.

I know there is a problem with Milei, but how much of that is felt in everyday life on a personal freedom level (I mean, I know there are economic problems that come with that)

So, I have always been obsessed with all things Uruguay and Argentine, even before I realized I was a woman and wanted to transition. I love Latin American cinema and literature, and I identify with that character. So, I am not the kind who is loud and flamboyant, just quietly flamboyant and confident. I am an extroverted introvert, and my idea of a good night is drinking one or two glasses of wine, lotsa coffee and mate, and discussing Bolaño, Borges, Onetti, Peri Rossi, poetry, and socialism. Everyone likes a good dance in a bit of a louder place every now and again, but I'm mostly the kind of person who keeps myself to myself until I trust people and can let my hair down with good friends.

So, are Argentinians really genuinely tolerant and not just performative like many Portuguese? (please don't think I am hating on the Portuguese, I have many good friends here, but any Portuguese people reading this will know exactly what I mean). Also, I prefer Argentina's informed consent system for HRT, rather than Portugal's required gender dysphoria diagnosis..

I understand that quality takes a backseat, but I know what I am getting every time. Coffee is not a hobby for me, it is a necessity. With that being said, I know and appreciate good espresso. I am seeking a machine that will consistently produce 8/10 shots as long as I am doing my part with respect to grind/weight/bean quality and the factors in can control. I have read the information reference Bambinos, Dedicas, Gaggia Classic and I am completely disinterested in an appliance/machine that cannot produce a consistent output without pushing this button for 7 seconds, twisting this knob and saying a short prayer to whoever or whatever your preference is. In my opinion any machine that can't reproduce a product every time given the same variables is useless. I want to do my part, load the portafilter and push the button for and 8/10 every single time. I don't need a 10/10, I would even settle for 7/10, but it needs to be every time without modding or dicking around. What should I be looking for?

* I had extremely high cholesterol levels: 354 total with LDL at 265 and HDL at 82 in November 2024.
* Rather than take recommended statins, I educated myself by reading the New York Times bestselling book, *A Statin Free Life,* by Dr. Aseem Malhotra, and vowed to reduce my cholesterol levels thru diet and lifestyle changes with a goal of 15% reduction in three months.
* I radically changed my food intake from a high-protein, Paleo/keto-esque diet to a Mediterranean diet with a pointed focus on consuming soluble fiber from legumes and other veggies.
* After three months, I lowered my LDL cholesterol levels from 265 to 105 (total cholesterol levels went from 354 to 162) 🎉
* My PCP had never seen such a dramatic change in his 30+ years of practice.

*\*April 12 edits at bottom\**

**Background:**

In November 2024, I saw my PCP for a regular check-up and requested labs to be run for the first time in my life. For context, I’m 37-year old male; non-smoker, not overweight, with regular strength and cardio training. All results came back with flying colors *except my cholesterol levels:*

My total cholesterol level was 354 – with my LDL at 265 and HDL at 82. For context, current Western medicine practices describe healthy levels of total cholesterol at 200 and LDL cholesterol levels below 100 (\*see note at end).

My PCP was very concerned about my heart health, especially since one of my grandfathers died at approximately 40 years old from heart failure. Other members of my family also have elevated cholesterol levels and take prescribed statins. The doctor recommended that I begin to take a statin, specifically Crestor at 20mg, to lower my LDL levels.

However, I had also read articles and listened to podcasts about the “statin industrial complex,” its failure to improve patients’ health, contested longevity claims and other detrimental effects of statin use. In short, while I embrace Western medicine in many ways, I am largely skeptical of mainstream medicine’s approach to treat chronic diseases, especially when pharmaceutical drugs (see: greedy corporations) are in play to treat symptoms rather than root causes.

Leaving the doctor’s office, I – defiantly and somewhat ignorantly – set the goal to lower my cholesterol *without* the use of statins by at least 15% in three months.

In three months, I vowed to return for new labs and achieve the following goals: 

* Lower my total cholesterol from 354 to sub-300.
* Lower my LDL cholesterol by 20%, ie from 265 to 212.
* Lower my LDL:HDL ratio from 4.3 to 4.0 or lower.

*April 12th edit: If, after three months, I had not met or exceeded these goals, I planned to start taking the prescribed statin. \[Additional edits at bottom\]*

To cut to the chase, three months after my original labs, I returned to the doctor and got my cholesterol levels run again without having taken statins. Here are my results:

|Cholesterol levels|Original (11/2024)|New (02/2025)|% Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Total|354|162|\-54%|
|LDL|265|105|\-60%|
|HDL|82|45|\-45%|

My PCP had never seen such drastic improvements in cholesterol levels in 30+ years of practice. He almost couldn’t believe the results.

*The most important step in this journey was picking up,* A Statin Free Life, *by Dr. Aseem Malhotra, and following these recommendations, specifically following a Mediterranean diet.* I recommend that anyone seeking to educate themselves about cholesterol and statins to read this book. It is a quick read.

**Food change: From Paleo to Mediterranean**

When I walked out of the doctor’s office in November, I knew that I needed to change my diet. In short, I transitioned from a Paleo/Keto diet to a Mediterranean diet with focus on soluble fiber in legumes and grains. I’m as sure as can be that this change was the primary reason for reducing my LDL cholesterol by 150 points in three months.

Pre-November 2024, my main nutrition goal was oriented around my resistance and aerobic training: To consume at least 150 grams of protein per day.

A typical breakfast was three to four eggs. Typical lunch or dinners: Roughly 8oz of steak, or chickpea pasta with red sauce and chicken breast, or two cans of tuna fish with mayo and seaweed, abundant salads, hummus and veggies, and more eggs. I used ghee to saute almost everything (I’m allergic to the lactose in butter).

**New food lifestyle: What did I NOT eat?**

After my initial labs, I turned my food routine upside down. I eliminated all foods high in saturated fat and all processed foods. More specifically, I eliminated the following:

* Red meat and pork
* Butter, ghee and all vegetable oils – except olive oil
* Fried foods
* Processed foods 
* Ice cream and other sweets
* Bread and grains – except German bread ([example](https://www.mestemacher-gmbh.com/))
* Sugar and sweeteners\*
* Eggs\*\*

\*I still add/ed about a tablespoon of maple syrup into my morning coffee

\*\*The jury is still out on the impacts of moderate egg consumption on cholesterol levels. I chose to go more or less cold turkey, although by the start of month three, I began to eat two to three eggs per week (not per day, as before).

**New food lifestyle: What did I eat in abundance?**

Broadly speaking, I now focus on eating foods low in saturated fat and high in soluble fiber, and lots of veggies. The diet that is closest to this lifestyle is the Mediterranean diet. I now eat the following foods in abundance:

* Oatmeal and chia seeds
* Soups with legumes
* Vegetables, especially cauliflower, carrots
* Hummus – *without added canola/sunflower/vegetable oils*
* Chickpea pasta with red sauce
* Salads with leafy greens
* German bread
* Non-fat Greek yogurt
* Tuna fish with mayo
* Salmon (wild, not farm-raised)
* Sweet potatoes
* Chicken breast
* Fish sticks (comfort food 😊)
* Gluten-free pumpkin pancakes
* Extra virgin olive oil

A few additional notes on food:

* Overnight oats became a staple food. I now eat overnight oats every morning; it is ritual. Also, I add a lot of chia in my overnight oats since they are very high in fiber. (My overnight oats might be more appropriately called “overnight chia-oats”)
* No butter or ghee: I replaced ghee for olive oil in sautéing food (yes, I’m aware of the lower smoke point). 
* Abundant EVOO: I liberally consume olive oil: I probably consume over a cup of raw extra virgin olive oil per day on German bread, salads, soups, veggies etc.\* Spices and aromatics: I abundantly use Ceylon cinnamon and turmeric as well as fresh ginger and garlic for taste and anti-inflammatory properties.
* As a rule of thumb, avoid the use of ""conventional"" (ie herbicide/pesticide-sprayed) produce. Most of this produce is banned outside of the United States due to carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting properties.

Some go-to recipes that I use:

* [Overnight oats](https://www.loveandlemons.com/overnight-oats-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-65537) (I add a lot more chia seeds and use NF Greek yogurt)
* [White bean soup](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020503-parmesan-white-bean-soup-with-hearty-greens) (I used less parmigiano, more white beans, and add roasted cauliflower)
* [Oatmeal pumpkin pancakes](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/healthy-pumpkin-oatmeal-pancakes/)

**Lifestyle changes:**

I’m convinced that switching to a Mediterranean diet, focused on soluble fiber, was the primary factor contributing to my reduced cholesterol levels. However, other lifestyle factors may have also contributed to my elevated cholesterol levels, including (mental) stress and (physical) over-exertion.

Like for many, my work can be stressful – so I began taking more short breaks, being gentler on myself, and meditating in the morning for approximately 15 minutes at least five days a week. Before my first lab tests, I also followed a fairly intense workout regime: I would engage in anaerobic and aerobic exercise 4-5 times per week. After my lab tests, I reduced this amount to 3-4 times per week. I also use the sauna at the gym 3-4 times per week (12 minutes at approximately 190F).

**In conclusion:**

I do not purport to have a cure-all for everyone with elevated cholesterol levels. For example, some people have genetically-inherited high levels of cholesterol and they may benefit from taking a statin. I do not condemn the use of statins as a whole.

However, from my own experiences, I also believe that **diet and lifestyle changes can hold immense and undervalued benefits for reducing LDL cholesterol levels.**

In my opinion, the fewer pharmaceutical drugs that I take and the more naturally-aligned lifestyle – ie eating whole, unprocessed foods – that I can live, the better.

*A Statin Free Life*, by Dr. Aseem Malhotra, was godsend and I recommend anyone interested in learning more about cholesterol, and reducing their levels, to read this book.

A couple other notes:

* From my research, if you smoke or are obese, these two conditions need to be addressed ASAP.
* I plan on returning to my doctor for new labs every six months. I will update this post with results.

I hope this summary of my experiences helps you or your loved ones on your journey to live a healthy and life-affirming experience of this miraculous world!

*Bon appetit and love life!* 

\*The threshold for “healthy” cholesterol levels have changed over the years, perhaps informed by interests by pharmaceutical companies to capture more profits from higher usage of statins. Again, please read *A Statin Free Life* by Dr. Aseem Malhotra.

\*\*\*

*\*\*\* April 12th edits... A few things that I forgot:\*\*\**

* One's total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio (TC/HDL ratio) is a **very** important indicator of cardiovascular health used in conjunction with individual LDL, HDL etc numbers. Dr. Malhorta describes a ratio of 4 or lower as heart-healthy. My TC/HDL ratio changed from 4.3 to 3.6 as part of my diet and lifestyle changes ✅ 🏁. (Again, check out Dr. Malhorta's book, listen to podcasts with him as a guest etc).
* I consume alcohol infrequently; maybe 1-2 drinks per month
* At first I went cold turkey on half and half in my coffee in the AM, but that lasted maybe a week. I still add/ed about 1/2 cup to my Moka pot coffee in the mornings.
* I – surprisingly and gratefully – have not noticed a decrease in muscular mass or aerobic performance due to my reduction of protein and change in diet. I've never counted calories but I definitely eat more than the average American due to my workout routine – I go pretty hard at the gym because it's fun and challenging for me.
* It's called the ""Mediterranean"" diet for a reason: MANY people in this part of the world follow these traditional food ways. It's not restrictive at all, but instead delicious, flavorful, fun and nutritious. I don't consider it a diet, but a way of life. If you're American and haven't had a chance to experience the traditional food ways of other cultures (like, pretty much anywhere), I HIGHLY recommend it.",28,1744465269.0,mediterraneandiet,5,0.97,False

Like she will say things like, ""Hiiiii sweetie!! How are you? Oh my gosh, look at your dress, is sooo pretty!""

European guests and corporate people who are here for meetings don't care and ignore her. I'm pretty sure they don't care to leave any reviews. 

I am nice, I talk, I smile but I don't do all of that. If a guest comes earlier than what we open and asks for a coffee, I will go ahead and let them have it. Still not enough to give me a good review lol. Meanwhile to also add that I am European myself with a Slavic accent and it sounds way more rough than what a Southern American accent does. I feel like that counts in a way, she is probably being seen as nicer. 

Also to mention that coworker is a snake. She tried ro get me in trouble so many times since I was getting more hours and stuff. She told me that Trump is deporting all of foreigners, citizens or not and she is telling me because she is so 'concerned' about me. She will act super sweet to management and guests but really hostile to certain workers.

Mind you it was 34 degrees outside and he was causing zero disturbance. 
She threatened with calling security on him for doing the same thing he was allowed to do everyday. 
Wednesday morning, we received a message from the general manager that this man was banned with “no exceptions”. 
After talking to the manager that banned him, it had come out that the story told about Tuesday morning was not the truth and he was wrongfully banned. She had claimed he brought in an outside meal and was eating it in store (he had no outside food, just his Togo coffee from the restaurant).
This was confirmed by other coworkers and even another manager who was working and witnessed it happened. 
The manager said she’d “find a way” to unban him. 
Well today it was decided that he was banned indefinitely regardless of it being unjust. There’s some serious power dynamic problems at play here and they’re being taken out on customers. 
He was simply an unhoused individual trying to enjoy his coffee indoors as he did almost every morning. 
I don’t really know what to make of this but I am utterly disgusted. 
The thought of telling him he’s not allowed in the store and to leave was enough for me to quit.",15,1744465170.0,AmIOverreacting,8,1.0,False

1jxhfm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1jxhfm7/my_period_returned_after_two_2_years/,My period returned after two (2) years,"# TL;DR 

>My period returned after two (2) years. After suffering a month-long diarrhea out of the blue, I made some lifestyle changes to cope with it. Unknowingly, those changes made me more sensitive to insulin again, which I believe helped return my period. 

I am honestly ***floored*** that my period has returned. Before this, I’d just started accepting that maybe my period stopped because I was beginning menopause at 30 years old. After taking metformin for years and suffering LBM as a side effect, I gave up the thought of having a regular cycle again. 

But a few days ago, to my shock, my period came back. 

So why am I sharing this? 

This isn’t a “***follow this, and your period will come back***” story. It’s a reminder that small, consistent lifestyle changes can have powerful effects, especially when managing PCOS. Be kind to yourself, do what you can, and don’t underestimate the little things.

Anyway, here are the changes I made:

# 1. Stopped taking Metformin. 

I was able to take metformin in the past years and just suffered its side effects for a few days. But since I turned 30, I haven’t been able to shake off its side effects (LBM), so I stopped. Another reason I stopped taking metformin is that I suffered from a month-long diarrhea that wasn’t improving despite taking antibiotics once. So, after consulting a gastroenterologist and taking a different set of antibiotics and probiotics (erceflora) every day, it finally disappeared. My stool is now back to normal. 

# 2. Avoided dairy. 

I avoided drinking milk at all costs since I noticed it worsened my diarrhea. I still ate cheese, but I replaced dairy with oatmilk. 

# 3. Avoided too much caffeine (coffee). 

Before, I used to drink coffee every day, but ever since I’ve had my month-long diarrhea, I've avoided drinking coffee for more than two days straight. I also replaced coffee with matcha and hot cocoa. 

# 4. Started drinking chamomile-passionflower tea. 

I drink this herbal tea called Nighty Night, which I bought from Healthy Options. It really helps me fall asleep faster and calms my nerves when I have a hard time falling asleep. 

# 5. Took probiotics. 

I took probiotics in the form of Erceflora and ate a lot of yogurt. I believe this helped me restore my gut’s health and my inflammation along the way as well. 

# 6. Ate more black rice instead of white rice. 

I’m from the Philippines, so it’s very difficult to avoid rice in my meals. While I’m not totally avoiding eating white rice, I make sure to eat more black rice. 

# 7. Started walking, going out more, and socializing. 

Last but not least, I’ve been going out more to socialize with my friends and my community. I make sure I really go out at least once or twice a week since I only work from home. It’s easy to feel cabin fever even after just working at home for two days. I’ve also started walking for 1km at least twice a week. I do it every morning before I start working. 

That’s it. I’m just so grateful to be in a time and space in my life where I’m free to make these changes to my routine. So, if you’re struggling to make your period return, I really empathize with you. It's fucking tough. This condition drains us. And while it’s easy to put the blame on yourself, remember that no woman ever wants to be in this situation. Absolutely no one. So, please, please be kind to yourself more and just do what you can at your own pace.

I’ve seen instructions from the roasters recommending rest times. But I don’t really understand it or the effect it has on the been. Need someone to ELI5 this one for me.

+ why rest your beans?
+ what effect does resting your beans have on coffee quality or flavor development?

1jxhaqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/1jxhaqx/one_man_bands_what_are_your_thoughts/,One man bands... what are your thoughts?,"I've done countless hours of strictly editing in the last 5 years. However, I have done a few one offs where I am a one man band doing camera work, editing, whatever-ing.

I can't seem to find the reason to continue solely editing. The days given for a series is getting extremely hard to understand. I know they aren't big series, or huge budgets, but it's still work lol. I worked FT with a production company, where they would eat the costs (i was salary), but Im sure often times we exceeded the budget. I left because I felt like there was more on the table and I didn't really see any reason to continue (I would be staying at whatever low yearly raise at an already low salary) 

I feel like the disconnect comes to communication. It's always notes, time to interpret them, and then apply them. I feel like the client has the end word, but the people in between are really eating up time. It's like we get handed a time budget but the expectation to apply notes so quickly is just getting annoying. I don't even love this craft anymore because of it. 

My V00 is the edit that I send off to get feedback on story or whatever, my V01 is why I do what I do, V02 is to apply notes, V03 is the one where we go ""dont touch it!!!!"" (im generalizing here, but you get the idea). But the V04 to V0whatever is just dreadful because I either don't understand what is being said and drop the ball or maybe it's just because the person on the recieving end ""has"" to write notes. I think when you don't nail it out of the park the first go, it will suck, but I try not to let that think that is all my fault (I mean production can drop the ball hard, too). And I feel like this is happening more and more. 

Even when you get a few days added to a budget for this mess, it doesn't really encourage you to keep going ... as you know those hours are just like pulling teeth, scratching chalkboard with your nails and hitting your shins repeatedly with a skateboard all in one.

Maybe Im just losing that drive.

I look at ""one man bands"" where they shoot and edit and just get the product done with a plan of attack that is approved and agreed on. Mind you, these are short videos/corperate, but Im like hell man, sure your number is low but it's so much easier to quote and get a final product done, which is so much easier to budget your time in your month/year. Ive done a few recently, and I feel like I am pretty much on top of it and the client is happy. For the three that I did so far this year, I came out the other end right on budget. Sure you might get some bad ones, but I feel like that error margin isn't as high if you set it all down from the start. (paper trails, etc) and justify costs. Im not sure if it's what I want to do, but I definitely understand it and can see value in it.

But I speak with producers and they say these people are like cancer to the industry because they're cutting jobs... And yeah I get it, I didn't budget for a gaffer, sound guy, director, AD, video village, DIT, I budgeted for me and a PA (Not just someone to hand you coffee... like what we were taught in film school, but someone who is knowledgable and of equal skillsets and available on said shoot day), who got a good rate for the day.

I know they are two different products, but yeah, it's just a tough pill to swallow. Sometimes you want to be available for that TV series/docu series as you always think that it's the gravy, but i am finding it harder and harder to justify.

I get producers come in to get those bigger budgets and pull money from elsewhere etc etc to make a bigger deal out of the production.... but Im not talking about this market.

You can only be passionate for so long before you start missing your mortgage payments waiting on your next gig. 

What are your thoughts? Does your editing contracts have stipulations/How have you applied them? I feel like as soon as you eat into budgets, you make people sour. I would love insight on how to navigate this. 

If I refer to documentation provided by a user here from a previous post of similar nature, and I used it to build budgets that are almost 10 times larger than what is available. I believe it was 1 minute of finished content a day. it's just hard to send that off knowing that thru discussion that you're way out of the range. (the budgets Ive seen around my area are about 8 minutes of content a day, this is with multiple sources) Some can be better, some can be worse. But again, I feel like the lemon is already squeezed above 5 minutes a day. 

And this is also assuming that you get guidance and not a boat load of footage, which you never fucking know with these directors.

I hate to be that guy that says ""it isn't me, it's them"" ... BUT... I honestly feel like everybody involved is what eats the budget, unless you nail it out of the park and everyone is happy right away... but NOBODY can do that, 100% success rate, in any job. I wish I could streamline the editing process but it's literally everyone else that fucks it up for me. Again, im sorry to say this as I dont want to lay blame and it goes against how i am. ButtFUCK, I am annoyed.

Having spent time in a few different households lately, I couldn’t help but notice the impressive array of coffee-making contraptions—pods, presses, pour-overs, machines that look as though they might launch a Genie into the air who will offer to grant you three wishes. And this has left me wondering...

Am I the last person on Earth still brewing my coffee in an old-fashioned percolator?

Mine is one of those vintage plug-in models—the kind that sounds like a small volcano waking up. It growls. It gurgles. It threatens to erupt. And then, with a final huff of steam, it delivers the perfect cup. It makes the whole kitchen smell heavenly. Sure, it takes a bit longer, but there’s something satisfying about the process: it refuses to be rushed. Kind of like me before I finish my cuppa.

My fiancée (32M) and I moved in together about a year ago, and things have been mostly great — except when it comes to his family. They live about 10 minutes away, which is nice in theory, but lately, it’s become a bit overwhelming.

At first, they would drop by for short visits — his mom would bring over leftovers, or his sister would come hang out for coffee. But over the last few months, these visits turned into full-on hangouts during my work hours. They’d show up unannounced, sit in the living room chatting loudly, ask me to make tea or snacks, and even once asked if I could pick up his mom’s dry cleaning “since I was just home anyway.”

Last week, his sister showed up in the middle of one of my Zoom meetings with a basket of laundry and said, “Mom said you wouldn’t mind folding these since you’re always here.” That was the final straw for me. I wrapped up my call, pulled her aside, and as kindly as I could, explained that just because I work from home doesn’t mean I’m free or available. I said I’m not a stay-at-home spouse, and even if I were, I’m not their personal assistant. I told her I need them to respect my work hours and my space.

Word got back to his mom and now she’s saying I was “disrespectful” and that I’m pushing them away. My fiancée thinks I could’ve phrased things “more gently” and that they’re just trying to be involved in our lives. He said they mean well, and I should’ve been more patient with them.

But honestly, I feel like I was being taken advantage of. They don’t treat their own jobs or routines so casually, so why should mine be any different? I feel like I set a boundary that needed to be set, and now they’re upset because I’m not playing the role they expected.

Just a warning, this is so dumb what you’re about to read. I’m (23f) 6 months pregnant and don’t know if my reaction had anything to do with this. 

I woke up like 45 mins ago and went down to make breakfast for myself and my boyfriend (24m) looked like he was sleeping on the couch. I sat down on the couch and started eating and just scrolling on my phone quietly and he basically jump scared me and yelled “what are you doing” to play a joke on me. I got furious and got my food and coffee and went to our room to eat instead and he followed me up apologizing and I started to cry? Idk if it’s my hormones or what but like why would you do that?

So idk if I just got overwhelmed that like I couldn’t have a similar peaceful breakfast like how I did with my dad and it made me miss my dad.

1jxh5wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jxh5wz/struggling_to_feel_liked_or_accepted_by_other/,Struggling to feel liked or accepted by other women?,"Before you ask, I like myself. So much so that I spent a lot of time alone growing up in my own little world with hobbies and creating art and things. I always really wanted to connect with other girls but always struggled to make friends at a tiny school growing up and think I must missed some crucial social development. I've had some friends but never really felt ""liked"" or understood. My mom, for instance, has quirky tendencies and will say awkward random things, sometimes has antisocial tendencies and keeps to herself, and is not always aware of how she comes off (love her, but mouth meet foot). However she's a gabber and people LOVE her. They invite her to things and invest time and resources into her hobbies and projects --it's bananas. I'm also a gabber but find it hard to feel like other women like or understand me. My own mother struggles to ""get me"" too :/

I've experienced judgey/cliquey women before so that's also a fear but I've also been told by a few girls that I come across a little awkward (funny enough I thought THEY were awkward too lol), smart, cold, and intense. I struggle with either seeming too boring and quiet or being too loud. I sometimes say random things (adhd) without much lead-in or explanation. Sometimes people find this entertaining though. Anyway, I feel really insecure because I see my quirky friends have other friends and women genuinely like them but I get weird looks and body language that lets me know people just don't vibe with me. I've had friend dates from meetups or bumblebff where I thought it was going great and the other person ghosted or faded out. I also have social anxiety so the whole time I'm at brunch or coffee I struggle to know how to keep the flow of the conversation going or when to leave. And then I worry if I don't act cool enough they're going to realize I'm lame or something or come up with a reason not to be my friend and ghost like the others did.

I hate it because I love and admire other women so much and want most people to be my friend but I'm somehow sending the wrong energy/body language or missing cues. I was recently tested for neurodivergence and so far have been showing as ""neurotypical."" I very much march to the beat of my own drum, am passionate and outspoken, but recently have been more willing to learn and imitate social cues so I can interact better with other women bc I value that connection moreso where my independence and ""authenticity"" used to matter more to me. I now know I can still be authentic while just communicating better and considering how my words and actions are perceived by or affect others.

Having a network of women you can be friendly or social with is just so important I feel. I've learned so much from other women in the past and really value those casual and closer relationships. However, lonely younger me on the inside still feels really awkward and insecure and unsure of how to act around other women and in groups. Strangely I don't ever have this fear around guys and usually get along well enough with them which sucks because I really don't care how they feel about me and honestly kind of over them atm. How did you get more comfortable around other women and stop being terrified about them judging or not liking you? How do you feel connected without being so insecure about it?",1,1744464082.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

1jxh4vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1jxh4vk/could_this_be_a_sign_of_a_promotion_or_am_i/,"Could this be a sign of a promotion, or am I getting my hopes up?","I've been working at my current employer for 3.5 years as a senior-level IC. For the past year, I've been trying to get promoted to a lead role, and both my boss (group manager) and grandboss (design director) have been supportive of this. I have regular 1:1s with my boss and monthly skip levels with the director.

Our promotion cycle is twice yearly, and my boss asked me to put together a list of my recent accomplishments, such as the work I've been doing to ensure consistency across our product lines, the mentorship I've been providing to junior members of the team, and the training documents I'm drafting to ensure business continuity.

That was a month ago. Apparently, the calibration meeting was soon after I sent my boss the list. And in a subsequent meeting, the head of my entire team said it would take about a month for him to get news from the executives about their decisions. 

My boss is currently on vacation and won't be back until late next week. Yesterday, I got a meeting invite from the design director for a ""coffee chat"" this coming Monday. When I asked her if she wanted me to prepare anything for the meeting, she said no.

So I need your collective wisdom: is this coffee chat on Monday what I hope it will be? Or could it just be a polite, private way of informing me that a promotion is not going to happen?


Reasons for optimism:
- The timing is right for this news
- My boss and director have been very supportive of my work
- My company uses the 9-box system, and apparently I got a rating of 8 during the last round of review 6 months ago
- During the last round of review, one of the other directors noted that I was visibly making an effort to come to the office 2 days a week. For context, our team never got an official official RTO order from the C-Suite until this past week.


Reasons for not getting my hopes up:
- Common sense dictates that I am not entitled to a promotion, even if I want one
- I have regular skip-level meetings with my director and this could be more of the same

Former Massachusetts State Police sergeant Gary Cederquist (in green) left federal court in Boston after his January 2024 indictment.David L. Ryan/Globe Staff

A corruption case that rocked the Massachusetts State Police last year with the arrests of troopers accused of [rigging commercial driver’s license tests ](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/30/metro/six-current-former-state-police-troopers-charged-corruption-conspiracy-prosecutors-say/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)in exchange for gifts, ranging from a home driveway renovation to bottled water and candy, is about to unfold in federal court in Boston.

Jury selection is slated to begin Monday in the trial of two retired troopers and a Brockton commercial driving school employee accused of plotting to issue licenses to drivers who flunked the CDL test or never even took it. The test is designed to make sure truck and bus drivers know how to operate safely.

In some cases, prosecutors allege, troopers exchanged text messages describing some of the drivers they passed as “an idiot,” “a mess,” or “brain dead.”

US District Judge Indira Talwani, who is presiding over the trial, said if a jury is seated on Monday, then opening statements will likely begin Tuesday.

Prosecutors allege the scheme resulted in more than two dozen people getting commercial driver’s licenses over about five years without passing the required tests.

The case marked the latest in a string of scandals involving the State Police, including an overtime fraud scheme that sent some former troopers to prison and the racketeering conviction of the police union’s former president. But one legal analyst said the bribery scandal is among the most damning.

“The thing that’s most outrageous is that people who are not competent to drive trucks were allowed on the Mass. Pike and our roads, which makes it unsafe for all of us to drive,” said Howard Friedman, a Boston attorney who specializes in police misconduct cases.

Friedman called the allegations involving commercial driver’s licenses “worse than the overtime scandal,” because the crimes alleged could lead to accidents. “People’s lives are at stake.”

The three men scheduled to stand trial are: Gary Cederquist, the sergeant who was in charge of the State Police commercial driving license unit until his indictment; former trooper Joel Rogers, 55, of Bridgewater; and Scott Camara, 43, of Rehoboth, who worked at a commercial driving school in Brockton.

Three others charged in the scheme, retired State Police troopers Calvin Butner and Perry Mendes, and Eric Mathison, who worked at a water company and was described by prosecutors as a friend of Cederquist, pleaded guilty as part of plea agreements and are awaiting sentencing.

Attorney Anthony Riccio, who represents Camara, said Thursday that his client “looks forward to his day in court, but we will not be making any further comments at this time. We’ll leave that for the courtroom.”

A 74-count indictment returned in January 2024 charges the former troopers, along with Camara and Mathison, with conspiring to falsify records to give commercial driver’s licenses to people who failed to meet the requirements.

Cederquist, 59, of Stoughton, is accused of extorting a stream of benefits from different businesses in exchange for giving passing grades on skills tests administered by the State Police unit in Stoughton, including a new driveway for his home, a plunge pool, a granite mailbox post, and snowblower, as well as free water, candy, and coffee delivered to the unit.

In one instance, Cederquist allegedly gave a false passing score to the son of a hardware store owner, who paid for an $1,800 snowblower for Cederquist.

On another occasion, prosecutors allege, an asphalt company co-owner provided asphalt for Cederquist’s driveway, valued at more than $10,000, and was later told that his son’s application for a commercial driver’s license was “all set” and “in the mail,” even though he never took the test.

Applicants given preferential treatment on driver’s tests included fellow troopers, relatives of active and retired police officers, a Seekonk firefighter, and a driver with connections to a tow company in Canton, according to the indictment.

One of the licenses was granted to Rogers, who joined the commercial driver’s licensing unit in January 2022 and received his commercial license the following month, according to the indictment.

In a trial brief filed in March, prosecutors said they’ll present text messages to jurors that were exchanged between the troopers about giving a “golden handshake” or “golden,” meaning a passing score, regardless of how an applicant performed on the driver’s test.

A retired trooper who has been granted immunity from prosecution will testify that Cederquist asked him to perform “goldens” on three occasions, according to the trial brief.

Four state troopers, identified in the indictment only as troopers A, B, C, and D, are “expected to testify that they studied and trained for what they anticipated would be a real and complete CDL skills test,” according to the trial brief. Instead, according to prosecutors, Cederquist told them it wasn’t necessary for them to show up with a sponsor or a truck for their skills test.

When the troopers arrived at the Stoughton testing site in October 2021, they were met by Cederquist and Camara, according to the brief.

“Each will describe the ‘test,’ which involved sitting in the cab of a truck with no trailer attached (meaning, not a Class A commercial vehicle) with Camara” and driving around with Camara, according to the trial brief. The troopers’ score sheets and test results show that Cederquist gave all of them passing scores for a commercial driver’s license, even though he didn’t administer the test, according to prosecutors.

Camara is charged with conspiracy and perjury. Prosecutors allege he lied when testifying before a federal grand jury in 2023.

A water company employee is expected to testify that Mendes didn’t require him to complete all of the requirements while taking his commercial driver’s license test, then afterward he helped Mathison move cases of premium water from the company truck to Mendes’s State Police cruiser, according to the government’s trial brief.

I came home from an exhausting day and fell asleep for about 30 min and woke up with the most severe headache I’ve ever had. Why? 

Cluster headaches are brutal, and I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. Waking up with an intense headache after a short nap could be tied to a few factors. Cluster headaches often follow a circadian rhythm, striking at similar times daily, especially during sleep transitions like naps. Your 30-minute nap might have hit a vulnerable point in your sleep cycle, possibly during REM sleep, which is a known trigger for some. Exhaustion from your day could’ve also lowered your body’s resilience, making you more susceptible. Stress, dehydration, or even changes in oxygen levels during sleep might amplify it.

Specific triggers vary, but common ones include alcohol, strong smells, or sudden changes in routine. If you’re not already tracking, noting what you did before the nap (food, drinks, stress levels) might help pinpoint patterns. For now, high-flow oxygen (if you have access) or meds like sumatriptan are go-to acute treatments—check with your doctor if you don’t have a plan. Staying hydrated and avoiding naps that disrupt your regular sleep might help prevent this in the future.

If you want, I can dig into more details or check for recent posts on X about cluster headache experiences—let me know. What’s your usual go-to when these hit?

_Disclaimer: Grok is not a doctor; please consult one. Don't share information that can identify you._

Yes please dig in more. I usually go to high flow oxygen as an abortive or a sugar free redbull with 2 excedrine tablets!

Glad I could help shed some light, and I’m happy to dive deeper into cluster headaches and what might’ve triggered that brutal post-nap episode. Since you mentioned high-flow oxygen and your Red Bull-Excedrin combo as go-tos, I’ll factor those into the explanation and explore additional angles, including triggers, nap-related mechanisms, and management strategies. I’ll also check for relevant insights from X posts, as you gave the green light for that.

### Deeper Dive into Cluster Headaches and Your Situation

**Why the Nap Might’ve Triggered It**  
Cluster headaches are nicknamed ""alarm clock headaches"" because they often strike at predictable times, tied to your body’s circadian rhythm. Naps, especially short ones like your 30-minute snooze, can mess with this rhythm. Here’s why:
- **Sleep Cycle Timing**: A 30-minute nap often lands you in light sleep or the edge of REM sleep. Cluster headaches are more likely to kick in during REM or transitions between sleep stages. Your nap might’ve hit this sweet spot, especially if you were exhausted, as fatigue can make these transitions more volatile.
- **Oxygen and Blood Flow**: During sleep, breathing patterns shift, and for some cluster headache sufferers, slight drops in oxygen levels (even normal ones) can act as a trigger. Exhaustion might’ve amplified this, as your body was already stressed.
- **Stress and Cortisol**: An exhausting day ramps up stress hormones like cortisol. When you crash for a nap, the sudden relaxation can cause a rebound effect, where your nervous system overreacts, potentially sparking a headache. This is similar to how weekend migraines hit when people finally unwind.

**Your Exhausting Day as a Factor**  
Exhaustion isn’t just feeling tired—it’s a neurological and physical strain. Here’s how it might’ve set the stage:
- **Autonomic Nervous System**: Cluster headaches involve the trigeminal-autonomic reflex, where the nervous system goes haywire, causing one-sided pain, tearing, or nasal symptoms. Exhaustion overstimulates this system, lowering the threshold for an attack.
- **Dehydration or Electrolytes**: A long day might’ve left you dehydrated or with imbalanced electrolytes, both of which are subtle triggers for some. Your Red Bull-Excedrin combo suggests caffeine helps, which could point to dehydration or low energy as factors, since caffeine boosts alertness and constricts blood vessels.
- **Skipped Meals or Blood Sugar**: If your exhausting day meant irregular eating, low blood sugar could’ve played a role. Cluster headaches aren’t as tightly linked to hypoglycemia as migraines, but it’s a known aggravator for some.

**Your Treatments and How They Fit**  
Let’s break down your go-to strategies:
- **High-Flow Oxygen**: This is gold-standard for aborting cluster headaches. It works by increasing oxygen levels, which calms the hyperexcited nerves and constricts dilated blood vessels in the brain. Most studies suggest 100% oxygen at 12-15 liters/minute for 15-20 minutes stops attacks in 70-80% of cases. If it’s working for you, that’s awesome—keep it handy.
- **Sugar-Free Red Bull + Excedrin**: This is a smart combo for many:
  - **Caffeine (Red Bull)**: Caffeine narrows blood vessels and enhances painkiller absorption. A sugar-free Red Bull has about 80 mg caffeine per 8.4 oz can, roughly equivalent to a cup of coffee. For cluster headaches, caffeine alone isn’t always enough but paired with meds, it’s a booster.
  - **Excedrin (Acetaminophen + Aspirin + Caffeine)**: Two tablets deliver 500 mg acetaminophen, 500 mg aspirin, and 130 mg caffeine. The aspirin reduces inflammation, acetaminophen dulls pain, and the extra caffeine complements Red Bull’s kick. This mimics some prescription approaches, like combining triptans with NSAIDs, but it’s over-the-counter.
  - **Why It Works**: Your combo likely hits multiple pathways—vascular (caffeine), inflammatory (aspirin), and pain signaling (acetaminophen). The sugar-free aspect is wise, as sugar spikes can mess with some headache types, though less so with clusters.

**Potential Risks with Your Combo**  
Your Red Bull-Excedrin mix is effective, but a quick heads-up:
- **Caffeine Overload**: Between a Red Bull (80 mg) and two Excedrin (130 mg), you’re getting ~210 mg caffeine per dose. That’s safe for most but could cause jitters, insomnia, or rebound headaches if used often. For reference, 400 mg/day is the usual safe limit for adults.
- **Aspirin Load**: Two Excedrin give 500 mg aspirin. Frequent use risks stomach irritation or bleeding, especially if you’re prone to ulcers or take it without food. If you’re using this daily, a doctor might suggest alternating with other options.
- **Rebound Risk**: Overusing any acute treatment (even caffeine or Excedrin) can lead to medication-overuse headaches, though this is rarer with clusters than migraines.

**Other Triggers to Consider**  
Since you mentioned this was the worst headache yet, let’s explore what might’ve made it so severe:
- **Environmental Factors**: Strong smells, heat, or altitude changes during your day could’ve primed you. Did anything stand out (e.g., perfume, smoke, weather shifts)?
- **Alcohol or Nitrites**: Even small amounts of alcohol or foods like cured meats (hot dogs, bacon) can trigger attacks within hours. Any chance these snuck into your day?
- **Sleep Disruption**: If your nap threw off your usual sleep pattern, it might’ve compounded the circadian trigger. Cluster headaches often hit at night or early morning, so daytime naps can confuse your body’s clock.
- **Hormonal or Seasonal Shifts**: Clusters often follow seasonal patterns (e.g., spring or fall) or hormonal changes. April 2025 might align with a cluster cycle for you, especially if you get episodic attacks.

**Management and Prevention Tips**  
Beyond your current abortive strategies, here are tailored ideas to reduce frequency or severity:
- **Track Triggers**: Use a headache diary (phone app or notebook) to log naps, meals, stress, and attacks. Apps like Migraine Buddy work well for clusters too. This could reveal if naps or exhaustion are consistent culprits.
- **Optimize Oxygen**: If oxygen isn’t fully aborting attacks, check your flow rate (12-15 L/min is ideal) and mask fit. Non-rebreather masks work best.
- **Hydration and Electrolytes**: Sip water throughout long days, maybe with a pinch of salt or electrolyte tabs, to counter dehydration. This might reduce nap-related triggers.
- **Preventive Meds**: If attacks are frequent, preventives like verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) or short-term steroids are common. Emgality, a CGRP inhibitor, got FDA approval for episodic clusters in 2019 and might be an option if oxygen alone isn’t enough.
- **Nap Strategy**: If naps are a trigger, try a longer one (90 minutes, to complete a sleep cycle) or avoid them when exhausted. A consistent sleep schedule helps stabilize your circadian rhythm.
- **Non-Drug Options**: Some find relief with ice packs on the pain side, vigorous exercise (if safe), or nasal sprays like lidocaine. These can complement oxygen.

**Insights from X Posts**  
I checked recent posts on X for cluster headache experiences (as of April 12, 2025). Here’s what’s floating around:
- Users often mention oxygen as a lifesaver, echoing your approach. One post raved about portable oxygen concentrators for on-the-go relief, which might be worth exploring if you’re mobile during attacks.
- Caffeine combos (like energy drinks or coffee) are popular, with some swearing by Monster or 5-Hour Energy instead of Red Bull. Your sugar-free choice aligns with posts avoiding sugar triggers.
- A few people noted naps triggering attacks, especially short ones in the afternoon. One user suggested melatonin (1-3 mg at night) to regulate sleep cycles, though evidence for clusters is mixed.
- Frustration with misdiagnosis pops up a lot—some were told they had migraines or sinus issues. If your diagnosis is recent, double-checking with a neurologist might confirm you’re on the right track.
These align with your experience but don’t add major new clues. If you want me to search X again for specific tips (e.g., nap-related triggers), let me know.

**Why This Attack Was So Severe**  
The “most severe ever” part could stem from a perfect storm: exhaustion lowering your threshold, the nap hitting a circadian trigger point, and maybe an environmental or dietary factor stacking on. If this is a one-off, it might just be bad luck. But if severity is trending worse, it’s worth checking with a neurologist for imaging (to rule out rare mimics like aneurysms) or adjusting preventives.

### Next Steps and Questions for You
Your oxygen and Red Bull-Excedrin combo is solid, but to fine-tune:
- **See a Specialist**: If you’re not already with a headache specialist, they can optimize preventives or tweak your acute plan (e.g., adding a triptan like sumatriptan nasal spray for faster relief).
- **Monitor Frequency**: If attacks are daily or escalating, preventives could cut them down. Verapamil works for many without much hassle.
- **Experiment Safely**: If Red Bull-Excedrin risks rebound, try oxygen alone or swap Excedrin for ibuprofen occasionally to test what’s driving relief.

To dig even deeper, could you share:
- How often do attacks hit (daily, weekly, certain seasons)?
- Any specific triggers you’ve noticed besides naps (e.g., alcohol, smells)?
- Are you on any preventives, or just abortives like oxygen and Excedrin?
- Did anything unusual happen before this nap (food, stress, weather)?

This would help me tailor suggestions further. I can also search X again for niche tips or generate a visual (like a trigger chart) if you’d find that useful. What’s your next move when these hit?

1jxgz30,https://i.redd.it/3epocndlleue1.jpeg,Passed - first attempt,"I’m so happy that I finally passed my driving test today. I was super nervous and couldn’t sleep last night. I was confident in my driving but was nervous because my test centre was in another city, and I practised there only twice (4 hrs in total).I kept saying to myself that I just need 30-35 mins of calm, courage and confidence (along with safety). When we practise, we drive for hours, so 35 mins is nothing.The first time I started taking lessons was in 2022. My instructor was horrible; he gave me 35 lessons and charged a lot of money. One day he asked me to book a test, saying I was ready, and then did not show up on the day of my test and texted me saying I’d need 18-20 lessons more to get to driving standards (he just wanted to make money from me). I was heartbroken, demotivated and super angry, then he showed some nerve calling me the next day to book lessons with him, and I said I won’t be taking any more lessons. After this incident, I couldn’t trust instructors, and I was put off from driving completely.

In 2024 my husband motivated me, and we started driving around with him over the weekend, sometime around July last year. Had to pause for a month or two due to other commitments. Restarted in Jan 2025, then I made up my mind that I need to do it at any cost. Couldn’t find a date in my city, so I booked my test for a nearby test centre and spoke to an instructor to give me a few lessons in March. She was so nice to take up my last-minute request, and we did one 2-hour lesson in March and then again in April and an hour before my test (45 mins approx.), and I made 2 serious mistakes and messed up my manoeuvres.

My examiner was super nice; he made me feel relaxed. He was chatty but not that much to distract me. It was the smoothest ride of my life and the quickest too. By the time we were into 10 minutes of the test, I could feel my confidence level was very high.
It was very busy in the morning today with bikers, cyclists and pedestrians. At one point a pigeon decided to block the road, and it was right in front of me but decided to fly just in time (I was mumbling to myself, please fly, please fly, and even my examiner was mumbling the same).

Show me the question – how would you demist your rear screen?
Manoeuvre – parallel reverse parking

Repetitive Nontent: She loves coffee, sugar-free products, snack plates and snacks in general, Birdie's her best friend, she's FoReVeR PrOuD, lives for a good before/after photo, adores the breezeway for a backdrop, smiles when she listens to music in her car, mentions her God and occasionally Joe...ya know, her husband.

And i realize that the very same motion could be generated by a severe hangover...

But since i am not a storyteller, i cheated and asked ChatGPT for help, and oh my goosh!:

""Benedict Cumberbatch awakens like a man torn from the depths of Mordor, the dull throb of an apocalyptic hangover pounding behind his eyes.

\---

\*\*INT. BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH’S LIVING ROOM – MORNING\*\*

He lies motionless, cheek pressed to the floorboards, hair tousled, mouth dry. Empty glasses, snack wrappers, and a lone, glittering party hat surround him like the aftermath of a dragon's feast.

Then—

\*\*PHONE (O.S., muffled)\*\*  

\*“Reminder: Meeting in 15 minutes.”\*

His eyes flick open, bloodshot and wild. He does not rise. He \*crawls\*—with a slow, deliberate grace. The movement is serpentine, primal. A man reliving muscle memory from a motion-capture stage long ago.

\*\*BENEDICT\*\* \*(low, hoarse)\*  

“…There is something down here… something that speaks…”

He pauses. Hears it again.

\*\*PHONE (O.S.)\*\*  

\*“Would you like me to reschedule?”\*

He narrows his eyes, breath shallow.

\*\*BENEDICT\*\*  

“Well… \*thing\*… I can hear you. I can \*feel\* your vibrations…”

He turns his gaze to the \*\*sofa\*\*, low and dark and suspicious. He slinks toward it.

\*\*BENEDICT\*\* \*(mocking)\*  

“You are very polite… for a \*thing\*… and a \*hider\*.”

With a violent flourish, he dives into the cushions, hands flailing, flinging objects aside. A sock. A paperback copy of \*Hamlet\*. An old apple core.

Nothing.

His face twists in betrayal.

\*\*BENEDICT\*\*  

“You’re \*not\* here? No… no, you’re clever…”

\*\*PHONE (O.S.)\*\*  

\*“I didn’t catch that. Could you—”\*

\*\*BENEDICT\*\* \*(cutting it off, teeth clenched)\*  

“I wasn't asking...”

He slithers across the floor to the \*\*coffee table\*\*, where a suspiciously folded blanket rests like a trap.

\*\*BENEDICT\*\*  

“I know your games, thing. I can \*smell\* your lies.”

He yanks the blanket. A remote clatters out. A crumb explosion. Still no phone.

He snarls.

\*\*BENEDICT\*\*  

“You think I will grow tired. You think I will fall. But I am \*old\*. I am \*powerful\*. I am..... ugh...hungover....”

He jerks his head toward the \*\*bookshelf\*\*, where a precarious pile of scripts leans. He lunges, swipes them to the ground, frantically searching.

A voice, louder now:

\*\*PHONE (O.S.)\*\*  

\*“Would you like me to cancel your entire day?”\*

His head snaps to the \*\*trash can\*\*. The lid moves slightly in the draft.

He inches forward, eyes narrowed to slits.

\*\*BENEDICT\*\*  

“…Are you \*filth\*, then? Buried in rot?”

He lifts the lid. Banana peels. Teabag graveyard. No phone.

He stares into the abyss.

\*\*BENEDICT\*\* \*(whispering)\*  

“You… \*thing\*. You mock me.”

Then—\*\*the sound again\*\*, this time clearer, and nearby.

He stiffens. Looks up.

There, atop the \*\*fridge\*\*, barely visible behind an empty wine bottle, glowing like a cursed jewel—

\*\*The Phone.\*\*

He slowly rises, arms trembling. The hunter approaches his prize.

He seizes the phone, breath ragged.

\*\*BENEDICT\*\* \*(triumphant)\*  

“There you are… \*thing of silicon and betrayal.\*”

\*\*PHONE\*\*  

\*“Would you like to cancel everything?”\*

\*\*BENEDICT\*\* \*(softly)\*  

“Yes… burn it all.”

\*He taps the screen. Silence returns.\*

He collapses back to the floor, cradling the phone like a conquered relic.

\*\*BENEDICT\*\* \*(murmuring to himself)\*  

“…Never again. Never. Again. Tequila.""

  
P.S. I seriously think that Mr Cumberbatch could make an epic portrait of this story, with nothing more than a mobile phone camera and his extraordinary acting skills....

I am currently relatively proficient in 4 languages and I do honestly enjoying learning about various languages and cultures to an extent. I just wanted some advice and tips from you, perhaps a different perspective. In regards to my personality I am definitely not outgoing and do like to spend a lot of time to myself enjoying movies, working out and judging coffee shops based on their Espresso. I believe I have a solid chance at successfully integrating into Swedish society and I am willing to overcome the obstacles and inconveniences that may arise while trying to do the same. Could you please tell me a bit about how you feel I might be positioned to succeed or fail in this in the future?

The answers, while solid, leaned technical. To my mind, there are more important things, though, the technical stuff can come later. For me, I say develop emotional intelligence and empathy. Knowing how to treat people decently—whether you're refusing a visa, waiting for coffee, answering the umpteenth password reset request from the same person, or delivering a demarche about the latest DC panic—is key.

My answer to the question is this: master the Golden Rule. Be self-aware enough to own your mistakes. Be open to learning new things and challenging biases. Say hello in the morning, and say have a good evening when departing for the day. Be able to recognize and combat groupthink and try to never say, ""well, at my last post..."" We all have bad days, but you don't have to be a jerk, even when disagreeing, delivering bad news, or just saying no.

Develop humility and a sense of humor (you'll need it, or you'll end up broken and bitter). Aim to be the colleague people actually like working with. These are skills you can learn and will serve you well no matter where you find yourself, in or out of the Foreign Service. 

While being a toxic success story is technically possible... why bother? Learn instead to recognize a shared humanity with colleagues, visa applicants, MPs, journalists, thought leaders, and your taxi driver. It didn't come easy for me, actually, but I chose kindness early on and have made an effort to develop those related skills. And I like to think it's worked out so far.

Sometimes, the smallest things strangers do leave the biggest impact. People often remember when someone smiled at them on a bad day, offered a kind word, or helped them without being asked. Things like holding the door, paying for someone’s coffee, or helping someone carry something heavy may seem small — but they can mean a lot when someone is struggling. These little acts of kindness don’t cost anything, yet they stay in people’s memories for years.

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! So, picture this: I decided to switch things up and ditch all my goals for an entire month. Yup, you read that right. No lists, no bullet points, and definitely no stress over what I ""should"" be doing. Just me, living in the moment. 

At first, I felt like I was floating through life without a map. But guess what? Instead of spiraling out of control or turning into a couch potato, I stumbled upon something totally unexpected—a deeper sense of motivation. Talk about a plot twist!

Here’s what happened:

**1. Embracing the unknown.**  
I used to think having a plan was essential for success. But without goals, I was forced to enjoy the little things—like savoring my coffee instead of gulping it down mindlessly. ☕ Who knew just *being* could feel so rewarding?

**2. Discovering what really lights me up.**  
With no goals to chase, I started to pay attention to what truly made me happy. I picked up hobbies I had long forgotten. Painting, hiking, reading weird sci-fi novels... Suddenly, my passions were pouring out of me like a burst dam! 🎨

**3. Motivation moves differently.**  
Ever find that you can’t wait to tick something off your to-do list? Without rigid goals, I tapped into a new kind of motivation—the kind that feels exciting rather than obligatory. I found myself motivated by joy, not pressure. Who knew that was even a thing?

**4. Mindfulness over metrics.**  
Instead of checking off accomplishments, I focused on being present. I noticed how every moment held potential—even the mundane. Suddenly, washing dishes became a mini meditation session. 🍽️ Seriously, try it!

**5. A surprising boost in productivity.**  
Okay, hold onto your hats. I got *more* done without a structured plan. When I felt like doing something, I did it. If not, I didn't force it. The pressure was off, and in that freedom, creativity flourished!

Seriously, have you ever just stopped to wonder: **What if I allowed myself to go with the flow? What if I found motivation in the chaos instead of shying away from it?** 

So here I am after 30 days, feeling like I’ve unlocked a new level in the game of life. 🎮 Did I achieve ""big goals""? Not really. But I found something way better: a sense of intrinsic motivation that’s richer and way more fulfilling. 

Life isn't just about ticking boxes. Sometimes, it's about the adventure of living with an open heart. Who knew? Maybe we don’t always need a goal to get *somewhere* good.

\*sips laced coffee\*   
  
Ya fuck it, let's get bacchic! Bare with me folks! I'm going to take a round-about route, to make a point and request, but I promise I am going some where with this post, we are going to cover a few topics though, but it's not for nothin'!

Last night, after getting sick of watching videos breaking down how to pronounce Ancient Greek letters, pronounce accents, diaeresis, and the fuckin diphthongs  etc etc etc....  I wanted to put it into practice...  (Also, admittedly a *major* contributing factor to why I wanted a break from the videos I had this intense urge/compulsion to write...)

I decided to use this as an opportunity to praise The Muses, this time, specifically Calliope!

Before I let out whatever was clawing to come out of me, I started by writing this:

Καλλιόπη, δος μοι τὴν πνοὴν τῶν θεῶν***.*** *(Calliope, grant me the breath of gods.)*

Then I realized ""okay, okay... great authors **always** start with some sort of gratitude or praise (especially to The Muses) just like this, but I bet they actually speak it outloud too!  So with a little bit of googling, going back to videos etc I made this guide to help my English speaking ass:

**Kah-lee-OH-pay, dos moi tēn pnoh-ĀN tōn the-ŌN**

# Syllable Breakdown with Stress:

**Καλλιόπη** – *Kah-lee-OH-pay* (stress on ""OH"")

**δος** – *dos* (rhymes with ""boss"")

**μοι** – *moi* (like ""boy"" but with an 'm')

**τὴν** – *tayn* (rhymes with ""pain"", but nasal and short)

**πνοὴν** – *pnoh-ĀN* (stress on last syllable, “ĀN” as in ""awe"" but nasal)

**τῶν** – *tōn* (like “tone” with a long 'o')

**θεῶν** – *the-ŌN* (like “the-own,” with stress on ""Ō"")

Then I spoke it outloud (presumably BUTCHERING it) then with my google docs open, on a blank page, I closed my eyes... and essentially meditated, but with conscious intent to open myself up to receiving... something was already tryna push itself outta me, but I couldn't shake the thought about ***her -*** The Mother of Many Names...

All of her names are different cultural representations of **Earth Goddesses, Earth Mothers, or Feminine personifications of Nature, Fertility, and the Land** across world mythologies, religions, and folk traditions. Even though they all come from vastly different places and time periods, they are *all related* in that they embody the concept of the **divine feminine archetype** (which as you see I have also been obsessing over *this* lately... I will make a seperate post about her names, because I just added it here and that would make this post ***massive***!)

**\[huge section redacted!\]**

And after meditating (this is not a sufficient word to describe what I experienced, it was more like a blend of cognitive & emotional empathy, as if I put myself in Her cosmic shoes... and ***Trauma Bonded*** with Her in that moment, on an energetic ""*feels*"" sort of way...  Then, I wrote...

***ᾨδὴ πρὸς τὰ τέκνα μου***  
***(A Song to My Children*****)** 

*I am the Breath before your first, I created this place to be our Home.*  
*Left Rhythm in the rivers for your thirst, left ancestral memories stored in polished stones.*  
*I blessed you with Reason, before I gave you a name,*  
*And wrapped you in my Seasons...  both the Fury and the Flame.*

*You danced upon my belly when your feet were still unsure,*  
*I cradled every heartbeat, kept your fragile spirit pure.*  
*I taught you how to Wonder, how to shape and how to strive,*  
*But now I speak in Sorrow... for I fear you won't survive.*

*O children born of Starlight and my sacred, tender dust,*  
*Why do you treat me coldly, betray my boundless trust?*  
*I watched you chase Dominion, dig deep into my veins,*  
*While I wept beneath the surface, soaked in silent pains.*

*You scorch me for your comfort, tear open my green skin,*  
*And count your Gold in silence, while my children’s numbers thin.*  
*You measure progress proudly by what you’ve stolen and burned,*  
*But never stop to wonder what Wisdom you’ve unlearned.*

*Yet still... I do not Curse you, though I bleed, break and bend.*  
*For Love like mine is endless... I am Mother to the end.*  
*I reach for you in Agony, though you turn and walk away,*  
*While you set fire to Eden, I was left to blow my own ashes away...*

*I’ve seen you weep for Justice, I’ve seen you rise and try,*  
*Yet still you build your Empires where the innocent must die.*  
*But even now, if just one hand would touch my soil with Grace,*  
*I’d bloom anew in silence, and meet you face to face...*

*O listen now, my children, not with fear but sacred care,*  
*The winds are full of warnings, but also full of prayer.*  
*Return to me in kindness, not as lords but as my kin,*  
*And I shall clothe you in my beauty, let the healing all begin.*

*I do not need your worship... I never have, it’s true.*   
*I only ask you see me, and remember...* ***I birthed you.***  


So, NOW this morning to further my studies, I am going to track down every word in this poem which has a capitalized first letter (I did this intentionally, obviously) I'm going to track them down in the lexicons, I'm going to learn them, pronounce them, and REALLY understand them in Greek tongue and Greek thought...

Now, full-circle to my point(s):

\- Seeing as how I am self-teaching, any critiques on my approach? I can only watch and pay attention so long, I can only have no clue what I'm reading for so long, I bounce back and forth, and I have a hard time following any curriculum and teaching methods (which is why I teach myself everything, I'm autistic as fuck and operate on a whole other operating system when to comes to learning) 

\- is my pronunciation breakdown accurate? Am I on the right track?

\- does anybody else have any ""strange"" methods of learning things? I like to incorporate training into activities... I know its sort of infantile in it;s methodology but when the task is demanded from me, I reject the process, but when the learning is ""play"" or something ***I want to do anyway***, my mind crushes that shit!  ""NO BODY TELLING ME WHAT TO DO!"" - is something I struggle with *often*, admittedly... just work with me, don't bark orders, for fuck sakes... ahem... right...

\- I remember somewhere reading that Capitals are only used in titles? author names? Is that specific to Attic Greek? I forget! should I change this to all capitals?:  
  
***ᾨδὴ πρὸς τὰ τέκνα μου***  
***(A Song to My Children*****)**

I had more questions but now I'm drawing a blank, and this has gone on long enough, so I end it with an updated (but OLD) piece of artwork I made a couple years ago, because it just goes with this:

So, pour yourself a beverage and sit down to enjoy this long-ass essay/thought experiment  (it’s a fun ride, and definitely a trip down memory lane for us older fans) and lets talk about it on the other side. Part of me even hopes that maybe Shady Records will one day release a version of the album that more closely resembles Marshall’s original vision for his 4th studio album…one can hope! My initial thought and goal when I began writing this essay all those years ago was we might encourage this to happen for the 25th anniversary in 2029…so lets get talking about it and see what we can do to #ALTERENCORE.

# ALT-ƎRNCORE:  The Almost Album

A retrospective look at what might have originally been on tap from the controversial rapper, Eminem, before the infamous 2003 leaks. 

   As most long-time fans of Eminem do from time to time, I found myself thinking about the disappointment that was *Encore* the other day. Coming on the heels of the Big Three, and with the pre-eminent rapper, Marshall Mathers, at the top of the rap game, *Encore’s* shockingly scattershot and seemingly uninspired track list left many fans at the time in a shocked state of disbelief. As a long-time fan of Em’s since he first broke on to the scene with 1998’s *The Slim Shady EP*, I can attest to the dejected state of the fanbase upon the album’s release in November of 2004. It was a dismal time for fans, to be sure. The final product was on a level so clearly beneath his previous offerings that it had many at the time expressing their disappointment on rap message boards, some literally believing that the release was a fake, a troll; the level of denial was so deep, some thought that the real follow-up to *The Eminem Show* was still to be released in the weeks that followed … but as the weeks passed, it became more and more apparent that what we were left with was Eminem’s first dud, leaving fans to wonder just how this could have happened.

The infamous leak, which happened in December 2003, eleven months prior to the release of *Encore*, was massive news at the time, and was no doubt an even bigger drain on Eminem’s creative process. Long before the dawn of social media, word of the leak trickled out to the fans only through interviews and wild rumours that spread online. It’s no doubt difficult for his younger fans to appreciate the depth of the impact of this leak; at the time, Em was the biggest artist in the world, at the very peak of his fame, and his rabid fanbase were foaming at the mouth to hear what the creative genius would offer up next. But then the leak happened…and whatever Em had been cooking up was dashed, leaving the embattled artist scrambling to cobble together something to release in its place. Eminem said of the experience years later:  ""Five or six songs leaked from the original version of *Encore.* So I had to go in and make new songs to replace them. In my head I was pissed off: ’Oh well. Songs leaked. Fuck it. I’m just going to take a bunch of fucking pills and go in there and have a party with myself.’ I’m sure the more pills I took, the goofier I got.” It’s clear from his words here that whatever vision he initially had was lost; Em was prepared to phone the rest in, and call it a day. And that’s exactly what happened.

Even though half the album remains peak Em in fine form, one can’t help but wonder what might have been if all those painfully mediocre tracks hadn’t been plopped in the middle. What might we have heard instead had the those leaks never happened? While it's always interesting to consider how the three bonus tracks later released as part of a supposed “Deluxe edition” could improve the seemingly uninspired album, the track lists fans usually put forth are often about the same; sub those three in for your least favourite of the cornier tracks (Big Weenie, Rain Man, My 1st Single, Puke, Ass Like That) and there’s no denying you’ve got a much better listening experience.  Some like to discredit this notion, insisting Em wanted to give us all of the lack-lustre tracks that plagued this offering, or that these songs weren’t intended as part of the main course, but I don’t believe that, nor does history really support the notion. Regardless, this has been done to death, and it is more interesting to consider what kind of album Em had originally envisioned before any of the leaks had occurred.

This essay is a look at what might have been, which I explore through an in-depth lyrical analysis of his creative output in 2003-2004; the leaked tracks, songs released on *Encore*, as well as the Invasion mixtapes which seemed to be dropping every other month in the wake of *8 Mile*, and which offer clues to Em’s mindset and possible creative direction. So, when Em took to the studio to begin recording his fourth major-label studio album, he had a mighty task ahead of him: when you’ve just put out three acclaimed albums, a holy trinity of sorts, and are currently enjoying the view from the top of the rap game, just what do you do for an encore?

**Ǝ**

First of all, and most importantly, if we take a closer look at some of this work’s predominant themes and  his other lyrical content during this era, it seems very improbable that his original vision for *Encore* included any of the anti-beefing sentiments expressed in *Like Toy Soldiers*, as the leaked tracks show that Em was still in a very combative state of mind. I think people have it backwards when they suggest *Like Toy Soldiers’* presence on the track list meant that the diss tracks would not have been included on the album. The content of the leaked tracks suggest he was more than willing, if not eager, to bring the 2002/2003 beefs with Benzino and Murder Inc to the masses on his first studio album since The Eminem Show. It is the opinion of this writer that LTS was actually an artistic afterthought brought on by the 2003 leaks that irrevocably altered *Encore* forever. Make no mistake, *Like Toy Soldiers* is a good song, a mature take on the very real dangers of beefing and surely one of the highs on the *Encore* we got. But again, this speculative essay is about the album Marshall Mathers was originally inspired to make… which was a very different beast.

While Em may not have planned to pick any new fights per se, *Encore* was surely going to be his cockiest album to date, with more than its fair share of braggadocios bars, and plenty of egging on of rivals in the rap game to challenge his skill and dominance, and that of his label, as it would be the first album where he could showcase his new label mates. I think he was still riding the high of those 2003 beefs and felt very much at home having fallen back into something like ‘battle rapper mode,’ his old comfort zone\*\*.\*\* This after putting out three highly acclaimed album that had already cemented his legacy as a rapper and lyricist of the highest order; also Em was still riding the wave of superstardom that *8 Mile* had brought him. I believe when a 2017 Eminem recalls on “Walk on Water” a point in his career where he had the world by the balls, licking out his palm - this was surely that moment. Em was brimming with confidence in those days. I remember when those Invasion mixtapes were dropping, Shady Records was at it’s absolute peak and literally everything Em touched was dope as fuck: (*“I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit, D-Twizzy in this bitch, with Obie Trice, so watch what you say ‘fore you call our name, cuz you say one more thing, it wont be nice!!*”) Those truly were the days to be an Em fan. (*“Bring Daddy his Oscar…we’re gonna shove it up Ja Rule’s ass!”*) He was on top with the much anticipated follow-up to *The Eminem Show* finally on the way, and fans couldn’t wait to hear what he would have to say next. I think it’s honestly difficult for some fans, who came to Em later in his career, to truly appreciate just how huge he was at this exact moment in time - which is a big part of why the *Encore* he delivered was such a disappointment to many. However, getting back to Em’s headspace when he began these recording sessions, it’s clear he intended to deliver a very different album that the scattershot and goofy one we got.

The leaked *Monkey See Monkey Do,* awesome though it may be, unfortunately sounds like it was intended only as a promo track, one he likely planned to drop in the months leading up to the album release, but it gives a vivid peek in to his headspace at the time, and it was like nothing Eminem fans had ever heard before. I always loved this track, particularly where he mentions his wish for someone like Nas or Jay-Z to come at him so he can dust off his chainsaw (*“and give 'em the surgery that he came for”*). Of course, the song goes on to say that he's got a list (*“that just ain’t Ja”*) that he’s going to read off come April, and that he’ll be shooting more than just paint balls (trust me!), a reference to fictional scenes in *8 Mile*, and frankly, one of the more intriguing lines of his career.The leak also unveiled both *We As Americans* and *Love You More*, two high quality tracks that would have clearly made the final cut and likely would have been centrepieces on the album (more on these later). On *Bully* and *Can-I-Bitch*, we get another hint on the type of content Em might have wanted on the album. On the former, he addresses the beefs with Ja Rule and Benzino just as he did in *Like Toy Soldiers,* but the tone is not so conciliatory and his verbiage is notably *not* in the past tense, as it was on LTS. It’s very clear that on *Bully*, Em is still firmly in beef mode, though perhaps a slightly more restrained version than we heard on some of the posse cuts the Invasion mixtapes gave us. As toned down as it may be, Em still sounds dead serious with his promise to have anyone killed in Hailie’s name should this beef ever cost him his life.This after mentioning too that if Ja doesn’t quit while he’s ahead, someone from G-Unit could kill him. Interestingly, in *Bully* Em also mentions Suge Knight for the first time (referencing his control over Irv Gotti), a line which is obviously in direct opposition to the one we ended up getting on *Like Toy Soldiers*: “*I went my whole career without mentioning* \[Suge\],” where he mentions the hip-hop mogul without mentioning him at all. By contrast, it’s pretty clear that *Like* *Toy Soldiers* is a sanitized and tonally different version of *Bully*, one which he likely wrote after deciding *Encore* would no longer present a continuation of the beefs of the previous year.*Ricky Ticky Toc* would have further helped to set that cocky tone had it been included on the main album, but sadly was likely another track to be axed once the concept changed. *“Once you call my name out things will never be the same, they should have never let us get a foot in this game*” sounds like a foreboding warning to anyone/everyone in the wake of Em’s TKO beefs of 2002/2003. Em is making an example of both Ja and Benzino here; let the quick work he made of them be a warning to anyone else with their eyes on the prize. Right after mentioning how far the beef with Benzino went, Em tells us he wants more: *“I’m waiting for that next beef, I’m cocked, locked and loaded, I’m ready to go so bad I’m going bananas”* all but confirms Em’s desire to stir shit up on this album. Soon after these bars, he’s quick to assert his dominance over any would-be challengers: *“Egos aside, 'fore I bruise 'em all. Swallow your pride ‘fore I step on it with shoes you call Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these? You gotta love ‘em, look at the bottom of em, they’re like cleats. Stompin’.*” The vintage Nate Dogg hook on Encore’s second track, *Never Enough*, also speaks to the originally intended flavour of the album: “*no matter how many MC’s I eat up, it’s never enough.”*

**Ǝ**

So, just how beefy was *Encore* going to be, that’s the question. I think the answer is…pretty beefy.  *Can-I-Bitch* is a decidedly more playful diss track, this time aimed at Canibus. A creative tour-de-force to the tune of Slick Rick’s *Children’s Stories*, Em has finally devoted an entire track to Canibus, and even if it is a bit silly, it’s still a fun ride (in the Rapmobile). In the track, he also sneaks in quick jabs at Jermaine Dupri and the Pet Shop Boys, the latter having penned a song about Em’s allegedly homophobic lyrics in 2002.

So, as some names begin to pile up here, are we perhaps seeing some of this supposed “list” of Em’s? Was he perhaps planning to respond in typical Eminem fashion to some of those who had dissed him during his rise to the top? A few of the name of this supposed Shit List: Ja Rule. Benzino. Canibus. Jermaine Dupri. Suge Knight? (Pet Shop Boys, lol?). Who else might have been on this list? Perhaps some would just get the odd bar, others entire tracks. Are there more diss tracks from this period stashed in the vault which didn’t see the light of day because they were shelved when the concept changed? Most certainly. A more aggressive track aimed at Canibus perhaps? Probably. Considering how aggressive *Monkey See Monkey Do* sounded, I’d like to think he recorded more aggressive bars than we got with *Can-I-Bitch* and *Bully*, perhaps some savage battle rap-style bars to finally eat up Canibus once and for all.On another one of the leaked tracks, Em rides Ja Rule some more, this time with D12, on *Come On In.* Em touches on the sport of hip-hop and his preference to keep it on wax, but hints once more that if you push him, he might take it further: *“I’d much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I’m pissed now, but it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic, cause I’m telling you right now, you’re not gonna like it.”*  Given Em’s apparent creative direction, there is little doubt this was likely to be the D12 cut on the  project, in the place of the mediocre *One Shot 2 Shot*. Clearly, Encore is about as ‘gangsta' as Em has ever sounded on an album; not his style per se, but one fans were happy to hear from as he was righteously pissed after having heard Hailie’s name on that Ja track.The swagger he had during this period was truly something else. The outro on *Monkey See Monkey Do* further solidifies how cocky and confident he was feeling, hence the desire to brings these beefs to the fore as a part of the album experience.There is little doubt beef and battling were at the top of his mind in ‘04, and fittingly so considering the world had just been introduced to his origin story in the Oscar-winning 8 Mile. At the end of *Monkey* he speaks to anyone who might want to step into the ring against him and the rest of the Shady camp: *“We ain’t just talking to one person. We talking to every-motherfucking-body who wants to bring it, cuz we bringing it to anybody who wants to bring it. So bring it. Don’t pick up the ball if you don’t wanna play, man. It’s all fucked up now. The fuck I’m suppose to do now? Huh? The fuck I’m suppose to do?*”  The Diddy reference at the end also speaks to Em’s apparent boredom at the top, asking what else he’s got to prove, or do, besides defend the throne upon which he sits. Any challengers? I believe this is exactly where Em’s head was at for those initial *Encore* recording sessions. Was it hubris? Perhaps. Would it have made for an entertaining album? Absolutely.

Now, let’s consider *We As Americans*. If this track hadn’t leaked, not only would it have been included on *Encore*, it would have been hailed as one of the best tracks on the album, but what’s more interesting is that it would have made him a poster boy for the Second Amendment, whether he intended it or not. In the song, Em is referencing his gun charges and subsequent probation, while questioning how he’s supposed to protect himself in the meantime. With his bare hands? Yeah, right. Later in the song, joking or not, he mentions the need to have a couple of concealed carries tucked away. We as Americans. We have to protect ourselves….by any means. With this song’s inclusion, the album takes on a *very* different tone indeed, especially in the absence of much of the silly filler. 

Notably, on the D12 track, there’s also talk about the possibility of taking rap beefs past the mere swapping of verses: *“…and that’s when it just happens and I snap then it’s a wrap, then it’s a scrap and it isn’t rap, is it?* *Hip-hop isn’t a sport anymore when you gotta go and resort back into that shit. Maybe I’m old fashioned but my passion is to smash anyone rapping without having to slap him. Believe me, I’d much rather lift a pencil than a pistol when I’m pissed now, but it depends on just how far it gets took on the mic.” \*gun shots\**  Add to that *We As Americans’* likely placement in-between the two skits that mention a supposed gun purchase by Em (which he denies making), and it seems to further solidify the notion that Em was trying to say at least \**something\** about gun rights. On the other hand, the mass shooting at the end of *Encore* adds a whole different dimension to the theoretical gun politics of this almost album. There is no doubt that the album was going to be a vastly different experience, and the other leaked gem is yet further proof of that.

The darkest track on the album, *Love You More*, adds another layer here. While the song is notable for the brutal honesty and dark imagery in the lyrics touching once more on his tumultuous relationship with Kim, those lyrics aside, that the song begins with the two of them in some Bonnie ’n Clyde-type scenario, cocking their guns and shooting them in unison…again, just imagine the original tone of this would-be album right now. This isn’t toilet humour, this isn’t gay put-put golf, and this isn’t puppet dog beefs….this *Encore* that Eminem wanted to give us was clearly something else entirely, and it would have no doubt been another very strong entry in his catalogue. Interestingly, on this (the real?) *Encore* (or something like it), Em also seems to have largely traded the dissing of pop stars heard on previous releases for more focused attacks on rappers and rivals in the industry; a refreshing change, as any Eminem fan would agree. Back once more to the possible promo track, *Monkey*: “You pussies think I went soft cuz 8 Mile, when I come back I’ll be shooting more than just paint balls” does not sound like the words of an artist about to give us a scattered and cheesy album bordering on self-parody.  On the contrary, Em sounds hungrier than ever and ready to feast on rapper's corpses.

So, the evidence is there to suggest *Encore* was going to be Em’s most combative album to date, cocky and sure of himself in a way we hadn’t heard before on a studio album - braggadocios as all hell with a classic trilogy under his belt, a biopic to his name, and the release of 50 Cent’s debut album *Get Rich or Die Trying* pushing Shady Records further into the spotlight as rap’s preeminent label. All things considered, it seems *Encore* was going to be a portrait of a rapper (‘slash actor’) at the top of his game, playing king of the castle with his competitors, while flaunting the success and dominance of his label. He was going to stomp on Ja in solidarity with 50; he was addressing the Racist tapes and airing his beef with Source magazine owner, Ray Benzino, who had accused him of trying to steal and destroy hip-hop culture; he would tell us more of his origin story in Detroit and bring us deeper into his dark and complicated relationship with Kim; he would address his gun charges and his suspended 2nd amendment rights, all in the wake of superstardom so immense that it was threatening his right to privacy more than ever before.  And by the end, in the final song/title track *Encore/Curtain Down,* he reminds everyone that his legacy has been a positive contribution to the culture as he helped bring hip-hop to a larger audience, reaching new ears around the world. So, anyone that tells you *Encore* was supposed to be the cheesy, uninspired mess we got, since he was all drugged out at the time, just doesn’t have all the facts: *Encore* was going to be dope as fuck. But then the leak happened.

**Ǝ**

When I consider the apparent gun politics of ALT-ƎRNCORE, at first it seems quite pro 2nd Amendment (based mainly on the lyrics from *We As Americans*), but when you consider this hypothetical track list on the whole, it ends up sounding almost like an argument against guns, a cautionary tale perhaps (which lines up with the axed *Like Toy Soldiers*, but with a different, darker tone entirely). Now, whether this was intended, we may never know, but let’s look at the events on the album:  you got a rapper, embroiled in beefs that got very personal the previous year, who states he’d rather keep it on wax, cuz that’s the sport of hip-hop upon which he was raised.  But if history has told us anything, it’s that when things get heated in rap beefs, shit can happen. So on first listen, we’re wondering where this is going? Clearly he gets his hands on a gun or two, as we hear on *We As Americans* and *Love You More.* Perhaps listeners were supposed to be wondering just how ‘gangster’ Em was going to be as the album played out, but then when you get to the end of the album, he keeps the battles on wax like the battle rapper he is, and instead, in a surprise ending nobody saw coming, we get Eminem going all Mandalay Bay on his own fans in a mass shooting/suicide to end his career (Reminder, for those that may not know: at the time, *Encore* was rumoured to be his last album; a working title of ‘The Funeral’ had even floated around the web). No matter which way you look at it, there’s no doubt guns were a part of some kind of album narrative here.

But what happened happened, and it would result in the first real blemish on Em’s discography. Not only had two standout songs leaked, but the others had revealed too much of the intended direction and general flavour of the album, something which I’m sure he’d hoped to keep close to his chest. But the cat was out of the bag, and so…Em abandons all tracks that were leaked, as well as some others that were written for the album (*Ricky Ticky Toc*) and goes the other way. He writes *Like Toy Soldiers*, a decidedly more introspective look at the beefs where he takes the high road instead, officially squashing the beef and then gets to work on trying to fill out the rest of the album. Unfortunately, lacking any real direction in the absence of what had been taken from him, he replaces much of it with the tracks that *Encore* tends to be remembered for, the goofier ones, and while still fun, the tone of the album is what suffers the most and we end up with something rather directionless and seemingly uninspired. To be fair, half of Encore truly remains a classic, while the other half…not so much, as Eminem himself has stated many years later: ”I’m cool with probably half that album,” he said of the album in a 2017 interview. Indeed, there’s some peak Em on Encore. The album just lacked that certain feel, that mood, the polished product we’d come to expect from Marshall which he’d delivered on each of his previous releases.

And so, as I said at the top of this long-winded essay…the other day I got to wondering just what *Encore* would have sounded like if we’d gotten the album Em had originally intended to make had those “*oh so notorious tracks”* not leaked in December 2003. Just what does *Encore* look like in that alternate timeline, the one where that friend of Em’s brother Nate (as the rumour went at time) didn’t steal a CD full of tracks intended for big bro’s next album… right off Nate’s coffee table when he wasn’t looking (yes, that was really the rumour).

The evidence strongly suggests, and this essay further demonstrates, that it would have been a very compelling follow-up his massively successful trilogy. So…how do you follow-up SSLP, MMLP and TES? What DO you do for an Encore?? By asserting dominance and playfully gloating about being the best, of course. So let’s take a look at what might have been, and as you do, know one thing for certain: this hypothetical track list is, without a doubt, a lot closer to how the album was initially intended than what we got. This proposed track list is a sort of Best Guess, based on what we know, and some of what we got, with a couple of fictional, but highly likely, vault tracks that were shelved thrown in for good measure. So buckle in to the RapMobile, and enjoy this timewarp back to the year…2004.           

Eminem has been in the studio for the past year. No tracks ever leaked and the last thing we’ve heard from Em via the label was his *8 Mile OST* contributions *Lose Yourself*, *8 Mile*, *Rabbit Run and Love Me*. People with their ear to the streets (read: paying attention to the internets) had heard the mixtapes and were treated to *The Sauce* and *Nail in the Coffin* as well as *Bump Heads, Hail Mary, Doe Rae Me,* and *Go To Sleep* in the past year or so as Em, 50 and D12 went at Ja Rule, Murder Inc, and Ray Benzino, co-owner of the Source magazine, with a certain ruthlessness fans hadn’t seen before in Em’s career. Clearly a lot had happened since the Eminem Show, and he had a lot to get off his chest…

**Ǝ**

The New Year hits, it’s 2004. You turn on the radio to your local hip-hop station and hear the deejay talking about a brand new song from Eminem that he’s about to debut, a promo track from the latest Shady Records mixtape, this time hyping Em’s follow-up to TES. The rumoured title…is ENCORE.

The beat drops, you hear Em laugh:\*

*“Heyo, Fifty…what I tell you? We ain’t even have to say shit. They did it…ha ha!”Monkey See, Monkey Do, don’t ever make the first move, just let ‘em come to you…”*

The internet is all atwitter - before Twitter -  about the upcoming Em album to be released in April. Many people (the masses) have never heard him talk this way; hoping high calibre rappers would come at him so he can dust off his chainsaw? He’s got a million bucks for anyone who gets on a track and spanks them? No doubt many, fans included, are hearing about the beef with Ja Rule/Benzino here for the first time too. 

And so, without further ado, I bring to you… the track list as it was (hypothetically, of course) intended to be. For reference below, I’ve included all relevant lyrics from various songs that help illustrate what I believe is Em’s initial creative direction for the album, many that made it onto Encore and some that didn’t. As an addendum to the track list, I’ve also listed main topics and ideas from each song that made the ALT-ƎRNCORE track list, which I believe further demonstrate the rather cohesive themes that appears to hang over this mysterious body of work. While much of the bones of this almost album are very much present in parts of the *Encore* we got…the true flavour of Em’s intended direction for the album truly come into focus with the inclusion of the excluded tracks which allows this listener to view the works through a fresh, much darker lens…

My husband & I own a small business and had used this whole room as a work space for years, so it was full of tables & boxes. Last year we finally had a garage built so I’m just getting to make this space nice again. I repainted, build the archway, and bought some furniture, but I’d love any help in completing this space! I wanted to do a light color pint because this room was too dark before, but I still want to aim for a sorta moody/college professor’s office kinda vibe 😂 Here are my ideas right now:

- A large round leather ottoman, a medium brown, instead of the coffee table (didn’t buy that for this space, just using it there temporarily).

-Leather bench along the side of the stairway

-Dark curtains, maybe mounted a little higher/wider.

-I have a very large wood/brass frame that I was to get a print for. I’m a horse girl at heart, so I’m thinking a fox hunting scene or vintage horse show poster, and putting it above the couch.

-A long and tall buffet/sideboard on the accent wall, maybe with a mirror above it?

- lots and lots of plants.

-Getting rid of that floor lamp, it’s not the look I’m going for, but more lamp lighting

It’s been almost three months since my relationship ended, and I’ve only felt more emotionally drained as time goes on. While dating my ex, I was balancing school, work, and trying to build a career in screenwriting, but still made time for her. The relationship was emotionally taxing, and I ignored early signs that it wasn’t working.

Things worsened around the time of my uncle’s memorial, who was killed by police during the pandemic. Conversations with my ex around my fear of law enforcement, anxiety, and how I navigate the world as a cautious and hyperaware person led to deeper emotional strain. She often criticized my demeanor and compared me to other men, making me feel like my caution and trauma were burdens rather than valid experiences.

Socially, I felt out of place around her friends and began having panic attacks at work. When I finally broke up with her, she reached back out and we tried therapy, but she placed most of the blame on me and never really acknowledged her own behavior.

In most of my relationships, I’ve been the one giving more. I struggle with feeling like I have to prove my worth through effort and generosity. After being cheated on and experiencing homelessness in a past relationship, I thought I was ready to try again, but I clearly wasn’t.

Now I’m dealing with intense self-consciousness, feeling isolated, and doubting whether I’m even worthy of dating without a stable career or emotional security. People have asked if I’m neurodivergent because of my reserved demeanor, and while I’m often described as safe or funny once I open up, it rarely leads to meaningful friendships. I’m trying to stay focused on school and my goals, but grieving all of this while lacking support is deeply exhausting.

**Here is the full breakdown:**

This is going to be a long post (24 paragraphs), so I apologize in advance. I wanted to be thorough, but I also understand that people have their own obligations and may not have time to read the whole thing. I’ve done my best to cut the fat while still giving a full picture of what I’ve been dealing with.

It’s been almost three months since my last relationship ended, and instead of feeling lighter, I’ve become more emotionally exhausted with each passing week. That relationship took a lot out of me. While dating her, I was also a full-time student, working close to 40 hours a week, and fully committed to building a career as a screenwriter. I gave whatever free time I had to her.

I wish I could say the relationship was always warm and easy, but it wasn’t. About 40 percent of the time, it felt like there was always something new that raised my anxiety. It felt like I could never fully relax. I also recognize that part of this is on me. I’m responsible for not ending things sooner. If I had broken up with her when things started going south, I would have spared myself a lot of unnecessary pain. I’m writing this because I’m seeking advice or perspective on how to get back on track. I know I’m in the thick of it, so outside insight might help. I’m in therapy, but talking to someone for an hour every other week hasn’t brought me the clarity I need. I’ve included a TL;DR at the top for anyone who doesn’t want to read the whole post, but for those who do, I appreciate you taking the time.

I didn’t understand the severity of my anxiety until I dated her. I’ve always been a cautious person. I stay aware of my surroundings and pay attention to people who might be in distress. I tend to err on the side of caution when I drive, especially if someone else is in the car. My ex would often say how irritating it was to ride with me and would sometimes joke about wanting to kill herself because I wasn’t aggressive enough on the road. I explained to her that when someone else is driving, they are responsible for your safety, and I take that seriously. My priority is always to make sure everyone gets home safely. I’ve always been the type of person who looks out for others and notices things that other people might not. Making sure the people around me feel safe, especially the person I’m dating, has always been important to me.

There was a crucial moment in our relationship that triggered a new level of social anxiety for me. It happened during the first week of September, just a few days before my uncle’s memorial service, which was held on the seventh. He was killed by the police in Las Vegas during the COVID years, and because of the pandemic, my family hadn’t been able to hold a proper service until then. At my family’s first reunion in over a decade, two of my aunties asked if my girlfriend would be attending after I mentioned her. When I told her, she happily accepted the invitation.

A few days before the memorial, she told me she wanted to talk about my fear of the police. She asked if I would always feel that way. I thought it was a strange question, especially since we are both Black and fully aware of how law enforcement often treats people who look like us. She said she had noticed how my energy would shift whenever I saw police nearby. She described me as becoming tense and alert, which made her feel nervous. My family has had several encounters with police brutality, including one incident I witnessed personally. I explained that to her, but she said it bothered her how anxious I became around officers. Her father had been a police officer, and she believed that not all of them were dangerous. She also mentioned that some people provoke the police and escalate situations, which made me extremely angry. I had seen the video of my uncle being killed. He didn’t do anything to justify what was done to him.

I told her I understood that there are officers who try to do their jobs correctly, but my concern was about the lack of accountability when things go wrong. She told me she didn’t want to raise a child with someone who might pass on that kind of fear or hatred. I responded that I hoped our child would never have to experience what I had, and that they would grow up in a neighborhood where those fears weren’t necessary. A few days after the memorial, she asked if I felt any sense of closure. I told her yes and explained how good it felt to see my family come together to honor my uncle. I also told her that I felt sad. My uncle was a flawed man who made a lot of promises he couldn’t keep. Seeing him die on video introduced a type of grief I had never experienced before. When I mentioned that the video of his death was from the COVID years, she paused and apologized. She told me she had thought he died when I was twelve, and that if that had been the case, she felt I should have already moved on. She admitted that if she had known it happened more recently, she would have responded differently and that she felt terrible for what she had said. She told me she was out of line and regretted it.

A day after my birthday (13th of September), we talked about the comedy show she had taken me to. During the event, a woman in the audience was visibly intoxicated and kept interrupting the comedians. At one point, she even tried to grab the microphone. I mentioned afterward that I felt uneasy and was worried it could have turned into a confrontation. On the way to her friend’s daughter’s birthday party the next day, she brought up how drunk the woman was, and I responded by mentioning my discomfort with how things turned out.

She asked why I always assume situations will end in violence. I told her I didn’t always think that, but sometimes it seems like a reasonable concern. She said I was the most fearful man she had ever met and that my anxiety frustrated her. She compared me to other men in her life, saying they didn’t see the world the same way. She also said her family (her dad) and friends had noticed how anxious I seemed, and that I often assumed the worst when things felt off.

I asked why it bothered her so much that I was hypervigilant, especially since I wasn’t hurting anyone or taking it out on others. She didn’t answer because we had just arrived at the country club where her friend’s parents lived. The place was clearly wealthy, and although I had been around rich people before, I felt completely out of place. I was respectful and polite, shook hands, made eye contact, but internally I felt frozen. I had never felt so aware of how I was being perceived.

I remember one guy laughing about losing fifteen thousand dollars betting on a Bears game. I couldn’t relate to anyone there and didn’t feel like I had anything of value to add. I also didn’t have much interest in trying. It takes me time to get comfortable around new people, and it felt like there was an unspoken pressure to perform. After a few hours of trying to socialize, I started feeling lightheaded. When she asked if I wanted to play pool, I realized I couldn’t even focus. I was seeing double for the first time in my life. She told me to sit down while she let everyone know we were leaving, but I still got up to thank the hosts before we left.

In the car, I started hyperventilating but kept it together just enough to avoid spiraling. When I calmed down, I explained how I was feeling. She said she didn’t understand why her frustrations affected me so much, and that she was only trying to bring up valid concerns. She told me it was the second time I had come across as awkward or distant around her friend and said that wasn’t a good look. She emphasized how important it was for her partner to get along with her friends.

I told her that while I’m not naturally outgoing, I can be warm and sociable once I feel comfortable. We talked for another thirty minutes, mostly while parked outside her house. Before we got out, she said she didn’t know what she would do about our relationship if I couldn’t get along with her friends. I ended the conversation there because I didn’t want to say something I would regret, but I was angry.

That tension lasted into the next month, through her Halloween party. I started resenting her and became short with her during certain conversations. At one point, I told her I didn’t think she believed in me, mostly out of frustration. Later, she admitted that she didn’t think I could get along with her friends and apologized for it. By that point, I was already irritated with her but chose not to escalate things. I hoped that if I let it settle, things would go back to normal.

Around this time, I started having panic attacks at work. I was working in the warehouse department of a retail store, which meant I didn’t have to interact with customers often. Eventually, I began noticing how afraid I was to interact with people in general. It felt ridiculous to be experiencing this at twenty-eight years old. I knew it was tied to my anxiety about how others perceived me, but I had no idea how to stop it. The panic attacks sometimes happened multiple times a day. After a while, I started avoiding going out to restock the sales floor. I knew it had gotten really bad when I had a panic episode in the store restroom and stayed there while my coworkers searched for me for over an hour. I came close to receiving a verbal warning, but one of my coworkers covered for me and helped smooth things over

A few weeks later, I finally reached a breaking point. After a conversation about preferences where my ex admitted that I didn’t align with many of hers, I spiraled and broke up with her. She reached out later that night, and I caved. She said we could work things out, and I agreed to give it another shot.

I felt that if we were going to have a real chance, we needed outside help, so I contacted a few affordable couples therapists. During the first of four consultations I had scheduled, the therapist asked us what we each felt was the main issue in the relationship. I explained my concerns, but when it was my ex’s turn to speak, the first thing she said was that she felt like she was giving 90 percent while I was giving 105 percent. The second thing she said was that she could never reassure me enough That upset me. It felt like she was placing the blame for the relationship’s stress entirely on me. She had done a lot that contributed to that stress, and those things had built up over time. I had hoped she would recognize her part in it and be willing to work on those issues, but that never happened.

In most of my relationships, I’ve been the one who gave more. Outside of two long-standing friendships, I’ve usually been the one putting in the effort. For me, it never felt like a burden. It just felt like doing what needed to be done. If I wanted to see my friends, I made the drive. If someone couldn’t afford a meal and I still wanted to spend time with them, I paid for it. Over time, I’ve had to pull back and become more mindful of how I spend my time, energy, and money to avoid overextending myself. Even now, I still struggle with this dynamic. I’m actively unlearning the belief that I need to constantly give something in order to prove my worth.

Near the end of our relationship, she started giving me mixed signals. One day, she came to my house to help set up the Christmas tree and brought my grandma her favorite coffee from Trader Joe’s. A few days later, she invited me to volunteer at her parents’ church giveaway, but didn’t acknowledge me or show any affection the entire time we were there. She kept sending me pictures of her hanging out with friends and stayed in contact until she left for a family trip to Texas.

Before she left, I told her I would miss her. She responded with, “We should focus on what will bring us the most excitement for right now.” I hung up on her, which was completely out of character for me. Later, she texted to say she was overwhelmed. What hurt the most was that she didn’t wish me a happy New Year. Six days later, she messaged me saying how much she loved me, how excited she was for the year ahead, and attached photos from her trip.

A week after that, she broke up with me. This happened right after I dropped off her Christmas and Valentine’s Day gifts. Deep down, I had a feeling we weren’t going to make it to Valentine’s Day. At that point, I was a mess. I’d wake up in cold sweats with heart palpitations. My anxiety was through the roof, and I have more gray hairs than I know what to do with. I’m just exhausted.

I don’t see myself dating again for a long time. Right now, I don’t even feel worthy of being in a relationship. I’m not where I want to be in my career, and I keep thinking about the flaws my ex pointed out. It’s not just about her, either. In the relationship before this one, I was cheated on twice and ended up homeless. When I finally got back on my feet, I thought I was ready to try again. Looking back, I wasn’t.

The main issue I’m facing now is that I’m still self-conscious around others, and I tend to minimize my interactions with people because of it. Last year, a few people asked if I was neurodivergent because of my awkward and monotone demeanor. That stuck with me. I worry that people either think I’m strange or already have made up their minds about me. People often compliment me on how safe I make them feel or how funny I am once I open up, but it rarely leads to meaningful friendships. That lack of deeper connection has made getting over the breakup even harder. I don’t really have the support system I need to make this transition any easier. I’ve been trying to stay focused on school while also working toward other goals and giving myself space to properly grieve. But honestly, it’s exhausting. For anyone who has gone through something similar, how did you get through it? What helped you recover emotionally, rebuild your confidence, or feel like yourself again? Also, what can I do right now to reduce stress or lower my chances of burning out? Any advice would be appreciated.

It was a year before we got engaged. I knew he still had feelings for her — the way he talked about her, how quiet he got when her name came up. I was terrified she’d come back and he’d realize he still loved her.

So I tracked her down, offered her the money, and said she should move on. She took it. No drama, no fight. She just vanished. He was heartbroken and confused, but I told him maybe she wasn’t who he thought she was. I comforted him while secretly making sure she stayed gone.

Now she’s back. Pregnant.

She found us at a coffee shop and said she needed to talk. She told him she left because she was scared, but the baby might be his. She’s not asking for anything — just wanted him to know.

And now he won’t stop asking why she really left. Why it all ended so suddenly. He’s suspicious. He’s digging.

And I’m spiraling.

If he finds out what I did — the money, the manipulation — it’s over. I don’t think he’ll ever forgive me. Honestly, I’m not sure *I* forgive me.

I told myself I was protecting our relationship. But now it feels like I was just proving I didn’t trust him.

Like, you have a wacky billionaire ex-TV star as the president who types 1am tweets in all caps. Then you have his evil hundred-billionare sidekick who wasn't even elected in, that puts on a dark hat and calls himself ""dark MAGA,"" then does a weird show with a chainsaw and a nazi salute. Then, out of something like a South Park bit, he livestreams himself playing a video game and just gets absolutely spammed with messages calling him worthless and that he'll die alone (not complaining about this part). 

Our HHS director has no medical degree, and has been on record shitting on vaccines and saying HIV might not cause AIDs and that AIDs is may be from the ""gay lifestyle"" of drugs and poppers. Our SecDef is a former fox news host. The vice president crashed out on live TV and berated the leader of our ally who was offensively invaded by an authoritarian country. The president wants to turn Palestine into a resort. The stock market is so volatile that anyone who's not a billionaire is fearing that they'll lose a chunk of their 401k.

It’s been almost three months since my relationship ended, and I’ve only felt more emotionally drained as time goes on. While dating my ex, I was balancing school, work, and trying to build a career in screenwriting, but still made time for her. The relationship was emotionally taxing, and I ignored early signs that it wasn’t working.

Things worsened around the time of my uncle’s memorial, who was killed by police during the pandemic. Conversations with my ex around my fear of law enforcement, anxiety, and how I navigate the world as a cautious and hyperaware person led to deeper emotional strain. She often criticized my demeanor and compared me to other men, making me feel like my caution and trauma were burdens rather than valid experiences.

Socially, I felt out of place around her friends and began having panic attacks at work. When I finally broke up with her, she reached back out and we tried therapy, but she placed most of the blame on me and never really acknowledged her own behavior.

In most of my relationships, I’ve been the one giving more. I struggle with feeling like I have to prove my worth through effort and generosity. After being cheated on and experiencing homelessness in a past relationship, I thought I was ready to try again, but I clearly wasn’t.

Now I’m dealing with intense self-consciousness, feeling isolated, and doubting whether I’m even worthy of dating without a stable career or emotional security. People have asked if I’m neurodivergent because of my reserved demeanor, and while I’m often described as safe or funny once I open up, it rarely leads to meaningful friendships. I’m trying to stay focused on school and my goals, but grieving all of this while lacking support is deeply exhausting.

**Here is the full breakdown:**

This is going to be a long post (24 paragraphs), so I apologize in advance. I wanted to be thorough, but I also understand that people have their own obligations and may not have time to read the whole thing. I’ve done my best to cut the fat while still giving a full picture of what I’ve been dealing with.

It’s been almost three months since my last relationship ended, and instead of feeling lighter, I’ve become more emotionally exhausted with each passing week. That relationship took a lot out of me. While dating her, I was also a full-time student, working close to 40 hours a week, and fully committed to building a career as a screenwriter. I gave whatever free time I had to her.

I wish I could say the relationship was always warm and easy, but it wasn’t. About 40 percent of the time, it felt like there was always something new that raised my anxiety. It felt like I could never fully relax. I also recognize that part of this is on me. I’m responsible for not ending things sooner. If I had broken up with her when things started going south, I would have spared myself a lot of unnecessary pain. I’m writing this because I’m seeking advice or perspective on how to get back on track. I know I’m in the thick of it, so outside insight might help. I’m in therapy, but talking to someone for an hour every other week hasn’t brought me the clarity I need. I’ve included a TL;DR at the top for anyone who doesn’t want to read the whole post, but for those who do, I appreciate you taking the time.

I didn’t understand the severity of my anxiety until I dated her. I’ve always been a cautious person. I stay aware of my surroundings and pay attention to people who might be in distress. I tend to err on the side of caution when I drive, especially if someone else is in the car. My ex would often say how irritating it was to ride with me and would sometimes joke about wanting to kill herself because I wasn’t aggressive enough on the road. I explained to her that when someone else is driving, they are responsible for your safety, and I take that seriously. My priority is always to make sure everyone gets home safely. I’ve always been the type of person who looks out for others and notices things that other people might not. Making sure the people around me feel safe, especially the person I’m dating, has always been important to me. 

There was a crucial moment in our relationship that triggered a new level of social anxiety for me. It happened during the first week of September, just a few days before my uncle’s memorial service, which was held on the seventh. He was killed by the police in Las Vegas during the COVID years, and because of the pandemic, my family hadn’t been able to hold a proper service until then. At my family’s first reunion in over a decade, two of my aunties asked if my girlfriend would be attending after I mentioned her. When I told her, she happily accepted the invitation.

A few days before the memorial, she told me she wanted to talk about my fear of the police. She asked if I would always feel that way. I thought it was a strange question, especially since we are both Black and fully aware of how law enforcement often treats people who look like us. She said she had noticed how my energy would shift whenever I saw police nearby. She described me as becoming tense and alert, which made her feel nervous. My family has had several encounters with police brutality, including one incident I witnessed personally. I explained that to her, but she said it bothered her how anxious I became around officers. Her father had been a police officer, and she believed that not all of them were dangerous. She also mentioned that some people provoke the police and escalate situations, which made me extremely angry. I had seen the video of my uncle being killed. He didn’t do anything to justify what was done to him.

I told her I understood that there are officers who try to do their jobs correctly, but my concern was about the lack of accountability when things go wrong. She told me she didn’t want to raise a child with someone who might pass on that kind of fear or hatred. I responded that I hoped our child would never have to experience what I had, and that they would grow up in a neighborhood where those fears weren’t necessary. A few days after the memorial, she asked if I felt any sense of closure. I told her yes and explained how good it felt to see my family come together to honor my uncle. I also told her that I felt sad. My uncle was a flawed man who made a lot of promises he couldn’t keep. Seeing him die on video introduced a type of grief I had never experienced before. When I mentioned that the video of his death was from the COVID years, she paused and apologized. She told me she had thought he died when I was twelve, and that if that had been the case, she felt I should have already moved on. She admitted that if she had known it happened more recently, she would have responded differently and that she felt terrible for what she had said. She told me she was out of line and regretted it.

A day after my birthday (13th of September), we talked about the comedy show she had taken me to. During the event, a woman in the audience was visibly intoxicated and kept interrupting the comedians. At one point, she even tried to grab the microphone. I mentioned afterward that I felt uneasy and was worried it could have turned into a confrontation. On the way to her friend’s daughter’s birthday party the next day, she brought up how drunk the woman was, and I responded by mentioning my discomfort with how things turned out. 

She asked why I always assume situations will end in violence. I told her I didn’t always think that, but sometimes it seems like a reasonable concern. She said I was the most fearful man she had ever met and that my anxiety frustrated her. She compared me to other men in her life, saying they didn’t see the world the same way. She also said her family (her dad) and friends had noticed how anxious I seemed, and that I often assumed the worst when things felt off.

I asked why it bothered her so much that I was hypervigilant, especially since I wasn’t hurting anyone or taking it out on others. She didn’t answer because we had just arrived at the country club where her friend’s parents lived. The place was clearly wealthy, and although I had been around rich people before, I felt completely out of place. I was respectful and polite, shook hands, made eye contact, but internally I felt frozen. I had never felt so aware of how I was being perceived.

I remember one guy laughing about losing fifteen thousand dollars betting on a Bears game. I couldn’t relate to anyone there and didn’t feel like I had anything of value to add. I also didn’t have much interest in trying. It takes me time to get comfortable around new people, and it felt like there was an unspoken pressure to perform. After a few hours of trying to socialize, I started feeling lightheaded. When she asked if I wanted to play pool, I realized I couldn’t even focus. I was seeing double for the first time in my life. She told me to sit down while she let everyone know we were leaving, but I still got up to thank the hosts before we left.

In the car, I started hyperventilating but kept it together just enough to avoid spiraling. When I calmed down, I explained how I was feeling. She said she didn’t understand why her frustrations affected me so much, and that she was only trying to bring up valid concerns. She told me it was the second time I had come across as awkward or distant around her friend and said that wasn’t a good look. She emphasized how important it was for her partner to get along with her friends.

I told her that while I’m not naturally outgoing, I can be warm and sociable once I feel comfortable. We talked for another thirty minutes, mostly while parked outside her house. Before we got out, she said she didn’t know what she would do about our relationship if I couldn’t get along with her friends. I ended the conversation there because I didn’t want to say something I would regret, but I was angry.

That tension lasted into the next month, through her Halloween party. I started resenting her and became short with her during certain conversations. At one point, I told her I didn’t think she believed in me, mostly out of frustration. Later, she admitted that she didn’t think I could get along with her friends and apologized for it. By that point, I was already irritated with her but chose not to escalate things. I hoped that if I let it settle, things would go back to normal.

Around this time, I started having panic attacks at work. I was working in the warehouse department of a retail store, which meant I didn’t have to interact with customers often. Eventually, I began noticing how afraid I was to interact with people in general. It felt ridiculous to be experiencing this at twenty-eight years old. I knew it was tied to my anxiety about how others perceived me, but I had no idea how to stop it. The panic attacks sometimes happened multiple times a day. After a while, I started avoiding going out to restock the sales floor. I knew it had gotten really bad when I had a panic episode in the store restroom and stayed there while my coworkers searched for me for over an hour. I came close to receiving a verbal warning, but one of my coworkers covered for me and helped smooth things over

A few weeks later, I finally reached a breaking point. After a conversation about preferences where my ex admitted that I didn’t align with many of hers, I spiraled and broke up with her.

1jxganm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsindells/comments/1jxganm/glacier_canyon_lodge_review/,Glacier Canyon Lodge Review,"Spent Spring Break at the Wisconsin Dells. We stayed at Glacier Canyon Lodge and had access to Wilderness Water Parks. Here is my experience:

We had a three-room suite with a full kitchen. The room was clean and had two king beds and two full beds. There were two bathrooms with showers and tubs. The kitchen had a stove, microwave, dishwasher, fridge, and coffee maker. The only downside to the room was a constant white noise coming from the air return. Not sure if it was just our room or if it was that way in every room. We had a great time at the parks and enjoyed the room. We did bring our Roku stick to access our own TV entertainment.  
  
The water parks were a ton of fun for little kids up to adults. There is a wave pool and single, two, and multi-person slides. The staff was friendly. Each park has a center activity area for small kids, including slower slides and a 1000-gallon water dump. The bathrooms were clean.  
  
The bad news. If you need to buy anything, it is ridiculously expensive. $20-30 for mixed drinks with little alcohol and lots of sugar. Food is marked up at least 200%. We had one meal, and I ordered 5 wings for $11, and the fries were $9. We made a Walmart order and cooked our meals. If we didn’t have a suite and had to eat out, it would have been stupidly expensive. Even the restaurants were more expensive. I think it would be a lot like Gatlinburg or a similar tourist trap.

I do not think we will go back. I'm very glad that it wasn't a busy week and we hardly had to wait for the slides. Our kids ranked *Klondike Kavern* as their favorite park. The wave pool was in second place. It was too cold for the outside facilities. ",0,1744461326.0,wisconsindells,1,0.5,False

1jxg8s7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jxg8s7/you_dont_want_a_drink_you_want_alcohol/,You don’t want a drink. You want alcohol.,"I kind of hate the fact that the la change of alcohol addiction is equated to being a ‘drinking’ problem.

Drinking, the verb, describes a key requirement for continued survival. We drink every day, regularly, to keep ourselves healthy and sane - in fact, not staying hydrated is a huge health concern for a large part of this population! As a species, far too many of us don’t drink enough! And yet here we are describing day in day out how much we struggle with stopping drinking. The subreddit is CALLED stop drinking.

Alcoholism being equated with drinking is such a total normalisation of what equates to what is essentially a socially acceptable drug addiction. 

But the drug is a beverage instread of an injection, so it’s palatable. It’s flavourful instead of smelly, so it’s classy. Except, arguably, drugs are generally less harmful to society than alcohol can be - heroin users nod out and potentially overdose. Alcohol users get into their cars and unknowingly destroy entire families, without any capacity for psychological awareness or memory retention.

And yet, despite the tremendous harm of alcoholism, every day I find myself waiting for the tube sat opposite a gigantic poster advertising Jack Daniels. And that repulsive slogan - “Make it Count”. Which is so ironic because does anything really count when you can’t fully remember it happening? Do your social interactions really count, if isn’t an authentic version of you who is interacting? Does it NOT count if you’re showing up sober?

I drink EVERY single day. I drink NA wines, beers, cocktails, sparkling water, tea, coffee, water, cordials, milkshakes, and sodas. I’ll never stop drinking - I stopped destroying myself with alcohol. I never “just really want to drink right now” (something I say several times a year when under tremendous stress.)

1jxg62s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxg62s,Workflow: Combining SD1.5 with 4o as a refiner,"Hi all,

I want to share a workflow I have been using lately, combining the old (SD 1.5) and the new (GPT-4o). I wanted to share this here, since you might be interested in whats possible. I thought it was interesting to see what would happen if we combine these two options.

SD 1.5 always has been really strong at art styles, and this gives it an easy way to enhance those images.

I have attached the input images and outputs, so you can have a look at what it does.

In this workflow, I am iterating quickly with a SD 1.5 based model (deliberate v2) and then refining and enhancing those images quickly in GPT-4o.

Workflow is as followed:

1. Using A1111 (or use ComfyUI if you prefer) with a SD 1.5 based model
2. Set up or turn on the One Button Prompt extension, or another prompt generator of your choice
3. Set Batch size to 3, and Batch count to however high you want. Creating 3 images per the same prompt. I keep the resolution at 512x512, no need to go higher.
4. Create a project in ChatGPT, and add the following custom instruction: `""You will be given three low-res images. Can you generate me a new image based on those images. Keep the same concept and style as the originals.""`
5. Grab some coffee while your harddrive fills with autogenerated images.
6. Drag the 3 images you want to refine into the Chat window of your ChatGPT project, and press enter. (Make sure 4o is selected)
7. Wait for ChatGPT to finish generating.

It's still part manual, but obviously when the API becomes available this could be automated with a simple ComfyUI node.

There are some other tricks you can do with this as well. You can also drag the 3 images over, and then specificy a more specific prompt and use them as a style transfer.

Hope this inspires you.

1jxfufi,https://www.reddit.com/r/mediterraneandiet/comments/1jxfufi/i_know_that_dairy_should_be_limited_but_how_much/,"I know that dairy should be limited, but how much is too much?","I’ve been working on my diet to move towards mostly whole foods and low processed. The main places for improvement has been my morning iced coffee, breakfast, and lunch. The dinners I make for my family already follow MD pretty well (usually protein, green veg, and whole grain or starchy veg), but I’m a SAHM so food during the day can be a challenge sometimes.This is what I’ve got going on so far: 

Morning coffee: 12 oz iced coffee, 1.5 tbsp heavy cream and 1/2 tbsp sugar free vanilla syrup (yeah, I know this is bad bad bad, but I’m working on using less and less until I can tolerate it black. I’d love to be off of coffee but the baby doesn’t sleep well so I’m dying for the caffeine)

Breakfast: 1/2 cup whole milk Greek yogurt, 1 tbsp chia seeds, splash of whole milk (to help absorb the chia seeds), 1/2 tbsp flax meal, cinnamon, pinch of salt, 1/2 cup diced fruit (usually strawberries and/or apples)

Lunch: 2 egg omelette with 1/4 cup scallions, 1/4 cup chopped spinach, small amount of diced tomato, 2 tbsp cheddar, drizzle of soy sauce (whole thing cooked using olive oil)

When I write it out like this, it seems like way too much dairy. So I can cut the cheese from my omelette, but I really like my breakfast so I’d rather not mess with it for now. I’m also allergic to most nuts and soy milk so a lot of non dairy options don’t work well for me. ",5,1744459796.0,mediterraneandiet,12,1.0,False
