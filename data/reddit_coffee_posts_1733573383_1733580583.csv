1h8t6s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/1h8t6s3/prompt_naruhina_oneshot/,Prompt; NaruHina oneshot,"The soft morning light poured into Naruto‚Äôs apartment, casting a calm glow over the room. The sounds of clinking dishes and gentle laughter filled the air as the two of them worked together to prepare breakfast. It was one of those rare moments where they didn‚Äôt have to worry about missions or responsibilities‚Äîjust a quiet morning spent in each other‚Äôs company.

Hinata had finished setting the table while Naruto had worked on the coffee. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the kitchen, Hinata was putting the finishing touches on breakfast, making sure everything was ready. Naruto, feeling satisfied with their morning so far, turned to the coffee mugs.

He picked up the two mugs, one for himself and one for Hinata, holding his own by the handle. But when he reached for her coffee, he did something that made her heart flutter. Instead of holding the mug by the handle, Naruto carefully cupped the body of the mug, his fingers wrapped around the hot ceramic, leaving the handle free.

He must have noticed how she always gingerly took the mug by the handle when the coffee was too hot to hold by the body, and now he was making sure to shield her from the heat, holding it in a way that would keep her safe from burning her fingers.

Hinata blinked in surprise, watching as Naruto walked toward her with the mug held in such a gentle and considerate way. It was a small gesture, but it carried so much care. He didn‚Äôt have to do this; she never asked him to. Yet, there he was, taking that extra step to make sure she was comfortable.

Naruto stepped closer and gently handed her the mug. ‚ÄúHere you go, Hinata,‚Äù he said, offering it with a soft smile, his gaze warm and sincere.

Hinata's heart swelled as she took the mug from his hand. She could feel the heat from the coffee, but also the quiet affection behind the way he had held it for her. Her cheeks flushed slightly as she looked up at him, feeling a rush of warmth in her chest.

""Thank you, Naruto,"" she said quietly, her voice tinged with emotion. She wasn‚Äôt sure why something so simple could make her heart beat so fast, but it did. It was as if every small act of kindness from him was a reminder of just how deeply he cared.

Naruto‚Äôs smile grew, his eyes soft as he watched her. ""You're welcome, Hinata,"" he said, his voice gentle. There was a quiet joy in his expression, knowing that he had done something to make her feel cared for.

Hinata met his gaze, and in that moment, the warmth from the coffee paled in comparison to the warmth she felt in her heart. ",1,1733580378.0,NarutoFanfiction,0,1.0,False

He's the most loving/romantic boyfriend I've ever had.

I bought a photo printer and want to keep an album of our pictures from travel. So last night I was looking at photos of us on his phone (we have always given eachother our passwords and been very open about our phones) that I can use for the album. 

A text popped up ""ü•≤"" from a woman's name I never heard of. I click the text, and there is no conversation. mind you, I'm an android user I don't really know how iphones work. I thought it might be an old friend so I left it alone and went back to the photo album. 

but it kept gnawing at me. we tell eachother everything and he has never mentioned someone by this name in the past 12 months we've been together. I end up going back to the message app to see what I can find, and lo and behold you can recover deleted messages. There's about 177 deleted messages between them, as recent as yesterday.

I instantly started to cry. he was asleep. I only saw the last few messages ""I miss you"" ""hey there beautiful"", etc. I didn't read anything else.

I put the phone back and silently cried myself to sleep. this morning I acted completely normal and even got up and made him coffee. he gave me a kiss and went to work.

Now that I've been sitting with it for a while, I want to see wtf they've been talking about. I've never been cheated on before, and he hid it so damn well. I'm afraid if I bring it up, all the evidence will be permanently deleted and I won't have the courage to leave him. I need to feel all the pain and betrayal that was said and done so I know that there is no recovering this relationship. 

I'm thinking of pretending nothing is wrong just for today and going back tonight to see what they have been talking about. 

Do you think this is the right thing to do? I've fully moved in now, I can't just up and leave overnight. I moved from across the country. any advice is appreciated. thank you",1,1733580209.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1h8t440,https://i.redd.it/5w9jvufsnf5e1.jpeg,‚ÄôTwas the Night Before Deployment,"‚ÄôTwas the night before deployment, on Mother Base‚Äôs steel,
Not a soldier was stirring, not even Ocelot‚Äôs heel.
The gear was all prepped in the armory with care,
In hopes that Venom Snake soon would be there.

The recruits were nestled in their bunks, all aligned,
While visions of S-rank missions filled their minds.
And Kaz in his scarf, and Snake in his horn,
Had just settled their plans for the battle-torn morn.

When out on the helipad arose such a clatter,
Kaz sprang from the mess hall to see what was the matter.
Away to the platform, he dashed with a flare,
Dodging supply drops that fell from the air.

The moon on the waves of the ocean below
Gave a shimmer of stealth to the scene aglow,
When what to his tactical gaze should appear,
But a Diamond Dogs chopper and eight D-Walker gear.

With a legendary soldier, so battle-scarred and thick,
Kaz knew in a moment it must be Venom Snake‚Äîhis Nick.
Faster than fultons, his orders they came,
And he whistled and shouted, and called them by name:

‚ÄúNow, Quiet! Now, D-Dog! Now, Ocelot, too!
On, D-Horse! On, Pequod! We‚Äôve missions to do!
To the enemy outpost! To the Skull base wall!
Now dash away! Sneak away! Neutralize all!‚Äù

As sandstorms that rise in the Afghan sky,
When faced with the enemy, Snake raised his eye.
So onto the chopper, his team they flew,
With their pockets full of C4‚Äîand Venom Snake, too.

And then, in a moment, Snake heard with a clink,
The sound of Kaz sipping his coffee, deep in think.
As Snake adjusted his bionic arm tight,
Down came Ocelot, ready to fight.

He was dressed in his gear, from his gloves to his boots,
His revolver was polished, his style absolute.
A bandana he wore, tied just like The Boss,
And his aura screamed legend‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt a loss.

His eye‚Äîhow it gleamed, his demeanor so grim,
Yet the fire of revenge burned fiercely within.
His sneer was sharp, his stance battle-ready,
And his grip on the mission was focused and steady.

The Phantom Cigar he held in his teeth,
As smoke curled around him, like a tactical wreath.
He had the stance of a leader, a soldier‚Äôs pride,
But the pain of betrayal still burned deep inside.

He nodded to Kaz, then turned with a twist,
As he checked their objective off on his list.
With Pequod in the chopper, their blades began to spin,
And they flew off to the battlefield to ensure they would win.

But I heard him exclaim, as he faded from sight‚Äî

1h8t32i,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1h8t32i/digital_marketing_agency/,Digital Marketing Agency,"So, you want to dive into the wild world of digital marketing, and you‚Äôre starting with zero dollars in your pocket? Well, let me tell you, you‚Äôre in good company. I‚Äôve been there before, but like a true underdog story, it‚Äôs all about how you leverage your skills, hustle, and maybe a sprinkle of divine providence.

### Skills You‚Äôll Need 

1. **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**: Think of SEO as the magical wand of the internet. It helps your content sparkle and shine in search results, attracting the right people who are looking for what you offer. You‚Äôll want to learn keyword research, on-page optimization, and backlink building. Grab articles and free resources‚Äîthere‚Äôs an ocean of knowledge out there.

2. **Social Media**: These platforms are like bustling town squares, just virtual. Understanding how to engage with your audience, create shareable content, and utilize hashtags effectively is where the magic happens. Social media isn‚Äôt just for cat videos, folks‚Äîthough we can all agree that they do brighten up our feeds.

3. **Email Marketing**: This is where you can create a more personal connection. Consoling your audience during their mid-life crisis through uplifting emails? Yes, please! Plus, nurturing leads through direct communication is a crucial skill. 

### Starting from Scratch

Alright, here‚Äôs the good news: You don‚Äôt need to be a Wall Street tycoon to jump into digital marketing. There are plenty of ways to get started with little to no money:

- **Educate Yourself for Free**: Platforms like Coursera, HubSpot Academy, and Google‚Äôs Digital Garage are gold mines. You can find courses on SEO, social media, and email marketing that won't cost you a dime. 

- **Networking**: Join Facebook groups, LinkedIn communities, or even local meetups (who knew the pandemic would prepare us for this kind of interaction?). Connect with others in the industry. You‚Äôd be amazed at how much free wisdom you can gather from a quick chat over coffee or a virtual call.

- **Leverage Free Tools**: Tools like HubSpot or Mailchimp have free tiers that are perfect for beginners. HubSpot gives you a CRM to manage contacts and tasks, and Mailchimp allows you to send emails to a limited number of subscribers without breaking the bank. Use these tools to refine your skills, build your portfolio, and test your strategies.

### Developing Your Strategy

Now, let‚Äôs talk strategy. It‚Äôs like a treasure map, and every ‚ÄúX‚Äù marks a place where you can find clients.

1. **Build Your Online Presence**: Create a personal website or a blog where you showcase your expertise. Use free website builders like Wix or WordPress, and throw in a pinch of your personality. Share valuable content related to the skills you‚Äôre developing. This is like showing your potential clients that you know what you‚Äôre talking about.

2. **Create Sample Work**: Craft a few pieces that showcase your SEO skills, social media prowess, or email marketing genius‚Äîeven if they‚Äôre hypothetical campaigns or case studies. This is your chance to strut your stuff without waiting for the title of ‚ÄúExpert‚Äù to come knocking at your door.

3. **Offer Free Consultations**: Reach out to local businesses or friends who might need some help with their digital presence. Offer them a free consultation, just so you can show off your skills. You‚Äôd be amazed how far that may lead. A small local coffee shop might take the leap, and before you know it, they‚Äôre singing your praises (for a coffee, of course).

4. **Utilize Social Media**: Share your insights on platforms like LinkedIn or even Instagram. Engage in relevant conversations, participate in groups, and showcase any testimonials from that unpaid consultation‚Äîit's all gold.

5. **Keep Learning and Adapting**: The world of digital marketing changes faster than your favorite sitcom gets canceled. Stay informed and adapt your strategies based on what you learn. 

### Landing Your First Client 

Getting your first client can feel like walking through a dark forest, but fear not, I promise there‚Äôs light ahead. Be consistent, and don‚Äôt be afraid to share your learning journey. Your authenticity will resonate with people.

Once you land your first client, treat them like gold. Overdeliver, communicate regularly, and build that relationship. They might just become your biggest advocate, and word-of-mouth is worth its weight in gold.

So, buckle up, lean in, and trust the journey. Every step you take is part of your overall narrative‚Äîa story of perseverance, growth, and yes, divine timing. You got this!",1,1733580056.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

1h8szop,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1h8szop/im_in_love_with_my_straight_best_friend_crazy_i/,Im in love with my straight best friend (crazy i know lol),"I know how cliche this is in gay culture and how this is the most commonly experienced thing, but nonetheless i feel crazy and maybe feel like i want to be heard, coming from a country where it is a crime to exist, this is my only outlet.

Im 19, and about 2-3 years ago i met this guy through mutuals, and the day i met him we clicked perfectly, and things were amazing, and we‚Äôve basically been best friends since. I knew early on i was gay but only shared it with people online, and just grew up being very straight-acting so i did not struggle with any discrimination or hatred, however it was very lonely. And to add to that, al the crushes i ever had were straight because gay people apparently don't exist here. But he was different, because i actually fell in love for a reason and there was a good bond and i felt like he cared about me as much as i did.

Me and my best friend have a really amazing bond, to the point where family and friends call us married and gay. Our friendship has always been fun, but not to take away from the fact that we get into fights/arguments. He is the avoidant kind of guy who‚Äôs never been properly loved so he takes advantage the second he gets it, and i am the anxious overly attached person (I‚Äôm just giving the kind of trope going on for clarification), so we have gotten into endless problems about how he ignores me or leaves me on delivered, sometimes the problem would get big that we go a week or 2 without talking, because i get so angry and he has a guilty conscience and will never admit that he‚Äôs wrong or feel guilt.It is really annoying because he is all i ever think about and when we go days without talking it kills me on the inside. So supposedly he is straight, and being gay isn‚Äôt really an option here, but that didn‚Äôt stop me from falling in love with him because there were so many things he did that implied the opposite. When we first became friends, it was winter and he‚Äôd always cover me with his jacket when i got cold, the first time we traveled together we verbally said lets cuddle, but that cuddling thing stopped the closer we got because it felt awkward to say it, but ever then n there id sneak up in his arms while sleeping over and he‚Äôd just let it slide. Some things that he always did till today, he always liked to hold hands and interlock out fingers when one of us was driving, he loved hugging me goodbyes and telling me he loves me when wed say bye or end call, also speaking of calls, we spent like the first year face-timing each other everyday before everyone goes off to uni, wed FaceTime before hanging out , and wed also call when we were Uber ing back to our houses(if he was at mine or I‚Äôm at his). I used to be someone who couldn‚Äôt express my emotions for shit but he made me love being verbal with the way i express emotions and affection more specifically.

Like i said, this wasn‚Äôt always the case, we both moved into town for uni when we first met, but i had moved a few years back for high-school so i had significantly more friends. But i would leave everyone in a second if he wanted to hangout. He on the other hand struggled with making friends a bit, but when he did i notice he would kind of like the feeling of making me feel like i am ignored or unattended, because i guess he likes the feeling of me double texting and chasing him (i do that lol), and i noticed that whenever id become mad that hes hanging out with ppl he would feel bad and call me to console me. It was this rlly weird love-hate thing where hed thrive off the feeling of making me feel like hes too busy to hangout, even though i never put him thru that. I guess it stems a little from the fact that he didnt have much friends.

In the past year, he started making way more friends and even started talking to girls (he had never ever had a thing with a girl before lol), and thats when he actually started becoming a bit too busy for me, it was annoying but dont get me wrong we still talked everyday and saw each other but not as compulsively. And sadly with time it started causing more problems, from both of us where he wouldn‚Äôt be making any time for me because he suddenly is talking to multiple girls and has a lot of new friends (but it wasn‚Äôt like rlly bad cuz i still felt warmth from him), and i was rlly crazy attached id get so pissed and ignore him, and we went weeks without talking to each other this summer because the second he senses that i am mad he doesn‚Äôt like to talk to me and take accountability. We‚Äôve fought and talked a million times and i feel like it started affecting me negatively and took a toll on me i just kept pretending like i didn‚Äôt care but deep down i did. But nonetheless, hed still hug me n kiss me on my chrek before saying goodbye, he even told me multiple times he wished i was a girl, and he laid on me once and said that if i was a girl hed fuck me, he directly asked me once during a sleepover if i wanted to experiment (to which i was so shocked i said no), he always tries to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù bring his hand on my crotch and thighs and always puts his hand under my butt while I‚Äôm sitting, he always also jokingly and sarcastically says ‚Äúu need to suck a dick‚Äù or ‚Äúdo you want my cock‚Äù. All these things just put me into even more mixed feelings, because culturally here these things can pass as a joke but i feel like he uses that to make subtle approaches, he really enjoys telling me how I‚Äôm submissive and jokingly says how I‚Äôm his bitch. 

After a long 6 month phase of constant lovey doveyness and some fights on and off. We had a bad arguemnt and i went 2 weeks without talking to me which was probably the longest we went without talking, and it messed me up so bad i told myself thats it i need to stop putting myself through this and just tell him how i feel . Which is exactly what happened last week. I texted him after not talking for so long and made a random excuse to meet up, to which he agreed excitedly because he missed me but just could never text me when i was mad (trauma shit idk), and we met up had coffee broke the ice and had desert it was an amazing night, and i had my car so i was dropping him off, when we were about 2 mins away i apologized for ghosting him again and he told me how he thought ‚Äúit was actually over this time‚Äù and even opened his hands and we held hands and interlocked them. After that i told him that theres something i need to say: i told him that for the past 2 years ive been in love with him (which implied that im gay obviously lol) and that ive been trying to stop myself and just couldnt bring myself and i was visibly nervouse asf, he told me he was sorry i had to feel tht way and that i couldve told
Him and he hugged me and told me that this wouldnt change anything, he even told me ‚Äúsometimes i feel that way too(as in feeling gay)‚Äù which is crazy lol but im trying not to think of it, he got really awkward affer like calming me down and said he had to leave cuz sleep early which was true. And since then its been a week he didn‚Äôt kiss me on my cheek, hed only hug me goodbye, but he cracked multiple jokes like ‚Äúsuck my dick‚Äù and ‚Äúu need my dick up ur ass‚Äù and id just want to like advance it so bad bcs i know hed never make a move if he wanted to but i just never csnt.

I know this is one long post but i just dont know how to deal with this but i really am in love with him and i feel like there is something but i know hed never make a move and i also just dont know how to.",1,1733579753.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False
1h8szjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1h8szjd/help_needed_building_an_alexa_routine/,Help needed building an Alexa routine,"I want to build a routine that tells me at bedtime if I forgot to place a coffee cup on my coffee machine, and I can‚Äôt seem to find a way. This is important because I have a morning routine that brews me coffee and I‚Äôve waste a huge amount of coffee because I frequently forget about the cup, lol

I have a voice triggered routine at bedtime that turns off lights and so on, and I would like it to give me a warning IF I forgot that particular task. 

Since Alexa doesn‚Äôt handle multiple preconditions except time scheduling, I‚Äôve tried different things like enabling Smart Things virtual sensors of several kinds, and real sensors like Aqara‚Äôs vibration sensor, and turning them on (or off) when I remember to place the cup, but I still can‚Äôt make Alexa warn me, since the sensor isn‚Äôt changing states at the time I trigger the bedtime routine. I‚Äôve also tried toggling routines on and off with the bedtime routine but to no avail.

I can get other apps to send me a written message but it doesn‚Äôt work because I really don‚Äôt read them. I‚Äôve also tried a routine where Alexa tells me at a fixed time to place the cup but I‚Äôm usually doing something else and forget about it.

I ordered a Roadsitalia Power Titanium (Euro5 approved)  and 2 days ago I had the 1000km scheduled maintenance so while I was at it I told the shop to install the new system. I was riding the bike there and I was thinking to myself ""meh, the bike doesn't sound that bad, maybe I'm throwing money away after all...""

So I leave the bike there and while waiting I was having a coffee like a couple blocks away and suddenly a mt09 sp '23 passes in front of me growling like CRAZY, popping, etc, people looking like wtf is that, and the guy riding it with a shit-eating grin on his face. I was like ""wait a moment... w-was that my bike?""

I phone the shop and ask if they have the bike ready and the guy tells me: ""well, you know we want to test it a little around here, be sure the lambda sensor doesn't throw any warning, huh, whatever..."" and I was like ""oh ok"" and thinking to myself ""motherfucker"".

Anyway when I got my bike back the money they asked for was pretty low and the guy was like a giddy kid ""dude that bike you got there is fucking nuts"" so I didn't got angry about it. Now when I got on the bike, omg, it's just insane how much the experience changed, I almost got it crashed that same day because I was so addicted to the sound when it was in the power band lmao.

Hi. I'm Nathaniel. I'm searching for you. I'm drinking coffee at McDonald's until the library opens I've searched for you since I was 4 or 5. My mom, on Christmas Eve, asked if I heard Santa's sleigh bells outside the window and up in the sky. I knew there was no Santa and in that moment I wondered why she would lie to me. Was everybody lying to me, part of some giant conspiracy? Was everybody brainless, without thought, with circuits and wires instead of blood and guts? Was I the only living boy, or the only uninitiated one? So ever since I've waited for you. I've looked for you, like turning over rocks and finding bugs and dirt and leaves underneath. Sometimes I swear I find your traces, tracking you a few steps behind. Maybe I smell you for a second walking through someplace, maybe for a moment through the fog in my thoughts your face is seen, your features clear, before it dissipates and I can't quite remember it. Do you ever start to go from thinking to dozing off, come fully awake again, totally forget what you were thinking, struggle to remember it? Right now you're like that to me. This is a beacon, an attempt to summon you. If only I knew the magic words. 

If you're looking for me too, say something. Anything. I think we'll kind of know. Whirlwind and flash, let's finally connect and experience the next part of life together. 

I feel more like me today and this post communicates what I feel a little better. Still, anyway, here's a Frankenstein copy paste of my old posts:

""edit: I don't think I want to do this anymore üíî

Hi. My name is Nathaniel, I'm 38, white, 6'1, 180 lbs., brown hair, blue eyes. I will send a picture if we chat, I'm okay with my appearance and I believe instant and physical attraction is important.

I've posted before but recently it's been vague, purposely misleading, and inaccessible. I don't feel particularly wordy, expressive, or elegant right now, so forgive how boring and blunt this post is but know it's a fractional and uninspired depiction of how I truly or typically am.

I just got back to Charlotte two days ago? Having escaped persons and situations that were hell and have been quickly retroactively revealed as monsters. I don't have any friends here and feel like a foreigner even though this is historically ""my home"". I want to meet someone here but I'm open to anywhere within reason.

I am an atheist, an anarchist, hate culture and politics and religion, hate any established belief systems, hate modern human invention, think even the most proactive human ""solutions"" are trite and self-serving, think ideas of human self-importance and intelligence are masturbatory.

I like The Cure, Sonic Youth, Fugazi, The Wipers, NIN. Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Batman '89, Ed Wood, They Live, Big Trouble in Little China. The Simpsons, Twin Peaks, Star Trek TNG, Mr. Robot. Watership Down, Dune, Lord of the Rings, Gravity's Rainbow, Franz Kafka. 80s NWA wrestling, 80s synth and goth and alternative and post-punk and new wave. 80s comics.

This post sucks. I'm just not in the mood. message me now. See me tonight. Tell me why you responded to me.

I posted earlier the stringent, maybe abbreviated, details about me. I didn't post what I want. So here:

I want to fall in love with someone immediately, the way you fall in love with a favorite book or movie before it's over. The way you don't want it to end, want it to go on forever and start again. I want a best friend. I am disconnected, totally. I don't see the world others see. I'm in a bubble nobody can get in, I want someone who's in a bubble too, whose bubble connects with mine. I want to get to know someone, their language. I associate a single word with many things. Say you say ""car"" or ""mountain"". It brings up associations in my brain, images, memories, definitions, colors. I hear what I would say if I was the one saying the word. I want to learn someone's words, their dictionary, their language. Combine our languages and truly know each other, see a combination of the worlds and truths we see. I want to understand them in a way that helps me better understand myself, the world, existence.

I want to truly connect with you.""",1,1733579387.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

The system has multi boot, one nvme drive with windows 11 and fedora 41 and another nvme drive dedicated to Hackintosh.

I did come up with a BIOS issue that I needed to enter and save the BIOS every time I used macOS (F1 at boot). The fix was to enable in Kernel-Quirks the ""DisableRtcChecksum"".

I intend to upgrade the GPU to an RX6800 that I have in another system in the beginning of the year but I'm still waiting for the new GPU releases to do so.

I‚Äôm looking to meet some like-minded people in Mumbai to hang out, explore the city, and maybe discover some hidden gems together. Whether it‚Äôs grabbing a coffee, trying out a new restaurant, or just having a good conversation, I‚Äôm up for it.

A bit about me:

 I am a total foodie and love trying out new places to eat. Living in Mumbai, there always is a new spot opening every two months and so much variety of cuisines that it keeps appeasing my tastebuds. Last I enjoyed was Creme Brulee at Pauls Cafe. Damn! It was delicious! 

I watch more of TV series. Over the years, I have gravitated from movies to TV series. My fav TV series are Black Mirror, Rick and Morty and Westworld (Uptill Season 2)

I also love books. I read both fiction and nonfiction. I recently read Short Stay in Hell, Jar of Hearts, and Convenience Store Woman. 

I‚Äôm easygoing and love playful conversations. I am a lil delulu as well. Plus points if you are a certified delulu like me. 

Open to meeting anyone who‚Äôs friendly and just wants to chill or do something fun in this bustling city. Let‚Äôs connect and plan something cool!

DM me if you‚Äôre interested. Please be 25+. Looking forward to meeting some awesome people!

Note - (1) I am here for SFW stuff only. Please DM me if you are looking for the same. 

(2) If We connect, I would like to chat for 2-3 weeks before we meet up

Have you ever considered how a simple habit could guide you toward a [**happier and healthier lifestyle**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/)? Daily journaling offers a unique opportunity to track your thoughts, feelings, and experiences, providing insight into your personal evolution. Does reflecting on your day sound like a valuable tool for enhancing your emotional well-being? If yes, discover how daily journaling captures moments and promotes reflection that promotes growth.

# Rethink Journaling Beyond the 'Perfect Day' Myth

For many, the idea of daily journaling might seem clich√©, especially with numerous influencers portraying it as a staple in their 'perfect day' routines.

This depiction often features pristine journals laid out on immaculate desks and a steaming cup of artisan coffee nearby. Such portrayals can create the impression that journaling‚Äîand, by extension, life itself‚Äîshould be a flawless aesthetic experience, leading to unrealistic expectations. It's important to recognize that the lives influencers present are curated snapshots, not complete narratives of everyday reality.

Daily journaling is valuable not because it is part of a picture-perfect routine but because it offers a genuine space for personal reflection and emotional processing. By journaling, you confront real thoughts and emotions, which is far more beneficial than emulating an idealized lifestyle that might look appealing on camera but is rarely sustainable.

Embrace journaling for its ability to provide a private, unfiltered medium for [**self-discovery**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/your-journey-of-self-discovery/) and emotional resilience, not because it's trendy or looks good in photos.

# The Impact of Journaling on Emotional Health

Have you ever wondered why so many people turn to journaling?

This practice proves powerful in managing stress and anxiety by allowing individuals to clarify their thoughts and feelings. The simple act of writing down your experiences can lower anxiety and improve your mood.

Therefore, daily journaling is a therapeutic tool, enabling you to unload burdens and clear your mind. Does this make you wonder about the last time you took a moment to really listen to your thoughts?

# Journaling Fosters Self-Reflection

Now, consider how self-reflection shapes our understanding of ourselves. Journaling doesn't just record events; it unravels the complex thread of our thoughts and emotions.

Maintaining a daily log allows you to witness personal growth and changes that will otherwise go unnoticed. This habit helps you [**build emotional strength during big life changes**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/how-to-build-emotional-strength-during-big-life-changes/), acting as a mirror that reflects your inner world. How often do you take the time to assess the changes within you and around you?

# There Are Different Types of Journaling That You Can Try

Beyond the traditional diary, various forms of journaling exist, each with unique benefits.

**Some of the most popular ones are:**

* Bullet journals, for example, organize thoughts through lists, trackers, and planners, ideal for those who thrive on structure.
* Reflective journaling dives deeper into the psyche, encouraging writers to explore their emotional responses to life's events.
* Then, there's [**gratitude journaling**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/7-life-hacks-to-cultivate-gratitude-every-day/), which shifts focus to the positive, enhancing overall well-being by acknowledging joy in daily life.
* Lastly, dream journalist opens a window to the unconscious, offering insights into desires and fears through the themes and symbols in dreams.

# Which type resonates with you?

By exploring these various methods, you can find a style that suits your needs and preferences.

Whether you seek to manage stress, enhance creativity, or gain insight into your subconscious, there‚Äôs a journaling form that can assist you.

Transitioning to a daily habit of writing might seem intimidating at first, but the personal insights you gain can profoundly impact your emotional health. Have you identified which journaling method might work best for you?

# Practical Tips for Incorporating Daily Journaling into Your Routine

Now, how can you incorporate daily journaling into your everyday life? Try to:

* First, consider the best time for you to write. Many find early morning ideal, setting the tone for the day ahead, while others prefer the calm of evening reflection. Do you have a quiet moment in your day that could become your journaling time?
* Secondly, choose your medium. Digital apps offer convenience and features like password protection and search functionality. However, traditional notebooks provide a tangible experience that many find satisfying. Which feels more personal to you, a screen or paper?
* Thirdly, address common barriers. People often hesitate to start journaling because they fear they have nothing interesting to say or worry about making grammar mistakes. Do these concerns sound familiar? Remember, the purpose of daily journaling lies in self-expression, not perfection. Could you allow yourself the freedom to write imperfectly?

# Learn These Journaling Techniques for Emotional Release

Additionally, explore specific techniques that facilitate emotional release.

For example, try stream-of-consciousness writing, letting thoughts flow without editing or filtering. This method can unearth deep emotions and insights. Have you ever allowed your thoughts free rein on paper?

Guided prompts also offer a structured way to engage with your feelings. Prompts like ""What challenged me today?"" or ""What am I grateful for?"" can direct your reflection and exploration.

Another useful approach involves regularly reviewing your entries. This practice allows you to track patterns and growth over time, offering a practical way to [**learn from experience**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/a-simple-way-to-learn-from-experience/)**.** When was the last time you saw progress in yourself through your writing?

# Journaling Even Has A Role in Therapy and Personal Development

Consider the role of daily journaling in therapy and personal development. Therapists often encourage clients to keep journals as a way to continue self-work outside of sessions.

Journaling can serve as a self-help tool, enabling you to clarify your thoughts and feelings, leading to breakthroughs in personal development.

**Are You Ready To Try Journaling Every Day?**

As you can see, daily journaling is a simple yet profound tool that aids in emotional health and self-reflection. Whether you seek therapy, personal development, or a way to manage daily stress, journaling offers a flexible, accessible means to these ends. Have you identified how daily journaling could fit into your life? Will you take that first step today?

1. **Walnut:** This is the star of mid-century modern furniture. Its deep brown tones with a slight reddish undertone scream sophistication. Whether it‚Äôs a walnut dining table or a sleek TV stand, this wood adds elegance to any room.
2. **Teak:** Teak has a honey-like warmth that‚Äôs both cozy and timeless. It‚Äôs common in mid-century dining chairs and tables because of its durability and stunning grain.
3. **Rosewood:** If you want something bolder, rosewood stands out with its darker, reddish-brown hues and dramatic patterns. It‚Äôs often used for statement pieces.
4. **Oak and Ash:** Though less common, lighter woods like oak and ash bring a more neutral, Scandinavian vibe to mid-century spaces.

What? She never told me shit about how we can't plug the heater and the counter top oven in at the same time. She never said a damn word about it. Now that I think about it more, she probably did that on purpose so I could learn by myself and get yelled at.

It changed how I approach projects and challenges, and it‚Äôs not just relevant for Hebrew learners ‚Äî it‚Äôs something that can impact so much more.

I often say that being an entrepreneur feels a lot like learning a new language. 

I know this deeply from living in my second language and from building my business. 

Both journeys are filled with uncertainty, moments of feeling lost, and the constant swing between celebrating wins and questioning everything. 

There‚Äôs no finish line, just progress ‚Äî and then, of course, life happens on top of it all.

But those challenges don‚Äôt take away from the rewards. 

They push you to grow, allow you to connect, and to discover possibilities you couldn‚Äôt have imagined at the start. 

It‚Äôs a wild, bumpy, surprising ride ‚Äî and one that‚Äôs so much better when you have the right guide by your side.

1h8sjte,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reduction/comments/1h8sjte/my_journey_to_surgery_and_status_so_far_3dpo/,My journey to surgery and status so far 3DPO,"Hi! Thought I‚Äôd share my thoughts in case they might help someone 

I‚Äôm a mature female with a very high BMI and my breasts we‚Äôre huge. I‚Äôd buy a 44H but I‚Äôd spill out of my bras. I was never sized. I should have had breast surgery 20 years ago but first I was terrified of the procedure and the possible bad results. 

I‚Äôm not one to go to the doctor and complain about back pain, neck pain and shoulder pain. My medical history only referenced a cold or two and I read where I need a medical history that documented my issues with large breasts. Finally as I was nearing my 60s, I was ready. I called a surgeon and the nurse told me my BMI was too high that I‚Äôd have to lose about 50 pounds before the surgeon would do the surgery. I have been unsuccessful in weight loss after having kids so I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do that. If it were that easy, I would. 

Over the past year I couldn‚Äôt ignore the pain any longer. I went to my PCP and told him I wanted to have breast reduction surgery. He asked me a couple questions related to my breasts and referred me to a surgeon. 

I met with the surgeon in August and he was surprised I hadn‚Äôt been there before now. He also said I could very well be the largest they have seen in their practice. I told him I was worried that my medical history didn‚Äôt support that my breasts were causing me problems and he said don‚Äôt worry about that, that he felt certain I would be approved.  He did tell me that due to my size, that I would be having a free nipple graft. He explained what that involved and we discussed loss of sensation in the nipple. 

I was approved and my surgery was scheduled for 12/4. I tried hard not to think about the procedure during the wait time and chose not to do much research for fear I‚Äôd back out. Close to the surgery date, I joined this subreddit and found some helpful information. 

Prep. I didn‚Äôt do much. I bought pineapple juice, cranberry juice,  maxi pads, Tylenol, ibuprofen, shower wipes, a stool softener, a couple sets of pajamas with button up tops, and a bidet attachment from Amazon which my son installed in minutes. 

My daughter went with me to surgery center day of surgery. We arrived at 6:30 am (surgery was at 8:00 am). We were told 2/3 hour surgery and that I was having a free nipple graft reduction. I signed all my papers, met with the anesthesiologist and answered some questions. My surgeon came in did his art work on my breasts. Next thing I know they put something over my mouth and told me to breathe and then I woke up in quite a bit of pain in my breasts.  I would describe it as a constant stinging and burning, a painful stinging. I was most concerned with my grandchildren seeing me in pain more than anything.  My surgery took four hours. 

The nurse gave me something for pain and said it would take a couple minutes. My daughter told me that the surgeon did not have to do the free nipple graft as planned. I knew this was a good thing but was curious as to why and know I asked the nurse a couple times as to why.  I was curious. 

They rush you out of the surgery center. I may have been in recovery an hour or two if that. The stinging and burning stopped thank goodness. While I was dressing, I vomited. Now we know that the pain meds didn‚Äôt sit well. They gave us some blue bags to take home with us in case I needed them. And I vomited again. So my daughter asked for extra. So ask!

We got home and I settled in my comfy recliner and my daughter fixed me some pineapple juice. The hospital pharmacy delivered my prescriptions bedside which was amazing. I received an antibiotic, OxyContin, and something for nausea. I took an antibiotic and immediately vomited and continued vomiting throughout the evening through the early morning. I decided I could not take the pain meds and did not after 1:00 am.   

I learned that during the procedure - I assume as then surgeon was finishing up- I was given an injection of Exparel. This injection must be why I haven‚Äôt had a lot of pain. I read online that it can last for 72 hours. I was told that I have to leave the blue wrist band on for four days which is an Exparel band noting the date and time I was given the injection. The reason why you must leave the wristband on is that if you went back to an ER or medical facility, if they were to give you another injection, you could OD. I will wear this band thru Sunday. 

Day after surgery was pretty uneventful. Not much pain at all but I did take two Tylenol and two Ibuprofen to stay on top of it. I drank a lot of water and added my stool softeners to my meds. I was able to eat on this day. I slept on and off. I walked around the house and used the bathroom. I wasn‚Äôt ready to take my shower and see what was there for me to see. 

Day 3 (Day 1 included surgery), I noticed a lot of swelling. So much that it looked like I had a new breast on my left side. And it was bruised. I sent photos to my surgeon‚Äôs office. I thought maybe a hematoma. Also note that I did not have any drains placed. The nurse called and advised me to either change into another bra that had higher sides if I had one and, if not, to not wear the compression bra, and to apply ice.  The right side had no swelling. I removed the compression bra and used ice packs on and off. Then the right side also grew a bulge. It felt like I had two balloons under my arms.  I showered and dressed and had leakage in the front and sides. I put maxi pads inside my top, one on each side and one over each breast to absorb any leakage. I continued to apply ice again to the side areas, then the front, and my chest. 

Day 4 has just begun. Good morning! Although I still am very swollen and have the side boobs, they are not swollen as bad so I will apply some ice today. I have not had a bowel movement yet. I hope to drink some coffee this morning and see if that will help. I massaged my tummy this morning and that felt really good. 

No regrets. Such a huge difference. I asked to be a size C and the surgeon said he would see if he could get me there. With all the swelling I look flat on top and bulgy on sides. But from my readings on here, the way I look will change daily and continue to change the first year so I am not freaked out about that. I can report that I have had no shoulder or neck pain since surgery and haven‚Äôt had to wear an uncomfortable bra that cuts into my shoulders. What a relief. 

I have not had to use the bidet but most likely will when I have a BM. I‚Äôm drinking a lot of water hoping to help with swelling, and I‚Äôm continuing to take my antibiotics but not on anything for pain not even the Tylenol or Ibuprofen.  I can eat normally and do have an appetite. I did not use the shower wipes but did use the maxi pads. 

I‚Äôm today without the compression bra and hope the swelling will continue to go down and then I will put it back on. 

The surgeon removed 11 lbs. I would have thought - based on my size - a bit more but if you think about it, that‚Äôs more than a 5 lb bag of sugar on each breast or a very large baby I was carrying around.  Whew!

My Christmas list is short this year. I only want nip covers because this gal hopes to not wear a bindy bra again!   

Thanks for reading. I apologize for the length but wanted to cover everything.

Chapter 1:

Samantha was lying face down on the floor, she had no sense of space, it was an inhospitable and lonely place where the sound of silence was deafening. Samantha could not feel her body from the neck down, having tried for countless times to move, but no significant change, only frustrated efforts, but she could see that she was in the valley of uncanny, as if she were a black scribble on a blank canvas where distance, space and size did not exist. However, even with the feeling of loneliness, she was not alone, a figure was watching her from above. She was similar to Samantha, her curly brown hair like a tree trunk, the clothes from the same store they wore, and their eyes were the same, the most disturbing thing is that they were like an abyss observing her (the brightness of life had been lost).  She spoke, the mysterious figure then began to say that they could not compete with her, why?, because of the fear that Samantha felt, the day that she would disappear and end her life being taken to oblivion, you can't compete with gravity, against nature or time. It's a paradox, fighting, fighting and fighting, she pondered that Samantha must remember her not forget and asked if she understood?.

She never knew the name of that figure, having started to form during her dreams and turning them into nightmares, but something in that blackened figure caught her attention, it was almost as if it had existed in that place forever, its so melancholic and depressive, with those empty looks staring at her with... Contempt?... No, it was envy, sometimes that strange figure mumbled phrases so low that they could barely be understood by Samantha and even if she didn't understand those words, sometimes that thing exuded feelings so deep linked to the negative desires present in thinking living beings that they could only feel hatred, anger, envy and desire.

The thing then did something Samantha could never have imagined. It began to move slowly, but similarly to a doll being held up by strings. The thing's hands rose and fell and began to approach Samantha's neck. When it reached it, it began to squeeze and squeeze. She felt distress and shortness of breath, combined with the misfortune of not being able to move and escape from it. The thing began to smile like a lunatic, and its eyes, previously empty and full of sadness, began to look murderous. It then asked Samantha to wake up, because now it was another day and it was time to get up.

She woke up almost immediately. Her face was pale as a corpse, and fear and confusion were as etched into her face as the reality around her. When she looked at her arms stretched out to her neck, she broke out in a cold sweat and became apprehensive about what she had just done. She certainly had doubts, but fear... Fear of what was happening to her.  Samantha looked at the broken mirror in her house, she gave a light laugh as if insanity was tied to her chest, asking in her mind if she was really alone. For a brief moment, the urge to cry ran through the nerves of her body and stuck to her conscience like chewing gum, but no! It was not time for her petty and unimportant dramas and now was not the time. She got up from her bed as she uttered the phrase said by the figure that seemed to stir her soul, that... was her and the most important thing of all was the following question about that which did not stop playing in her head like a repeated film, what is that!?  The haunting of her dreams that most resembles a mirror in its appearance, she took a deep breath and rubbed her hands on her head while suddenly saying the phrase (it's not real, it's not real, it's not real). When she had finished doing this, she looked up and stood for a few minutes looking at the ceiling and when she felt calmer she walked to the kitchen to get some bread and eat, Samantha reflected on that shadow that disturbs her dreams and makes them become a nefarious nightmare that causes her a fear as great as a scorpion. 

Samantha looked to see what she had to eat, and saw fruit and coffee powder and saw only a stale bread she took the stale bread, Samantha observed and pondered to herself that it was better than leaving the house on an empty stomach and she couldn't complain since she didn't have any money at the moment and then she opened the refrigerator and got a glass of cold milk and took a mug and put the milk to heat, at the same time she closed her eyes and expressed the lack of a coffee with milk and remembered that she didn't have any money.  While she heated the milk and was paying attention every second so that it wouldn't go past the point she wanted. When she finished heating the milk Samantha took the bread and walked to her bed and sat on it. She calmly ate her bread while sitting on her bed and thought about how disturbing that was, and to think that she was suffocating herself and that perhaps if it weren't for her dear luck, she could cause her own death.

When she finished her breakfast, she walked to the closet and grabbed the only clothes besides her pajamas that she always wore when she stayed at home to isolate herself from everything, her problems, her life and the people around her and just listen to dozens of her favorite songs and just listen to the melody and forget about everything around her and enjoy this relaxing moment. Samantha after putting on her best outfit, a cropped top and pants with a combination of dark blue and red, she likes this outfit even though the color red causes her some kind of strange trigger and remembers that in the past she almost hit a man who was trying to help her, sometimes she gets dizzy, starts biting the skin on her fingers and to add to it the difficulty of breathing, but only sometimes. She then took a deep breath and walked to the drawer of the desk that is on the right side of her bed, told herself that from today on she would not fail and she would definitely find them. Finding the card she closed the drawer and grabbed her keys and locked her house and left.  It was time to go, walk before the light illuminating this damned district, while looking at its surroundings, Samantha noticed that even in the morning Ormit Bukis was quite busy, the residents with their faces still sleepy, the young men and women with their skin on edge leaving those motels or brothels that seemed to be open twenty-four hours a day, the merchants opened their stores waiting for their beloved customers. The indisputable fact about Ormit Bukis is the pseudonym, at the very least eccentric, that it is known by but that reflects itself, ""district of sin"", it is popular for its corruption and where the most obscene, selfish and greedy desires last until you die or until the day your money is stolen. Well, the day is calmer than usual and that's what matters, thought Samantha who will think with great tranquility and calmness about who will be the next criminal to be hunted.  She looked at An ecron child holding a newspaper and exclaiming about a shocking news while saying ""extra! EXTRA!"" She approached him.

His name was Cameron, and he was an illiterate child living in the city. Poor boy, it was shocking for Samantha to imagine that little boy at his age having to deal with the adult world. She remembered when she first met him: as she was returning from a night of drinking and ashamed of the memory, she remembered that she could barely stand without falling after taking a few steps.  Even though she couldn't see around her (because she felt that if she turned her head, she would) she could still hear the whining of the people who were acting condescendingly towards her and Samantha couldn't get the most hostile and aggressive feeling out of her consciousness and at that moment the murmurs in her head took over her almost completely - until suddenly - passing through an alley, she heard howls of pain and the crying of a child and the call for help. She looked to the side and stared into his eyes, when she saw that, the cowards were kicking, the Ecron child lying on the ground who couldn't even resist the aggressions committed - one of them had a knife in his waist - possibly threatening her with that, Samantha, upon witnessing that scene, became revolted. However, she vomited before she could express any words or act; the attackers stopped the violence against only the pathetic woman who vomited in front of them, dumbfounded and confused they laughed at the person in front of them.  The man on the left, named Sprown, looked at his colleague and thought that they should seize the moment and steal the child's money while...

He couldn't finish his sentence because Samantha grabbed his neck, she squeezed and squeezed, Sprown was sweating cold and wondering how on earth a drunk woman could be so strong. Samantha looked at him with a murderous expression that was obvious and that resembled a monster; he was left breathless, she grabbed the poor guy's head who instinctively tried to resist and grabbed a knife that was at his waist and in a desperate attempt to free himself, Sprown stuck his knife in her shoulder, the fabric of his dark blue clothes was stained by the blood that was dripping down. Soon after, he bitterly regretted this decision. Samantha didn't give in, enduring the pain and concentrating on him, she used her strength and twisted Sprown's neck who in the last seconds of his life had witnessed true terror.  Afterwards, she ripped off her head and the blackened blood dripped from her body. Samantha looked to the side. A skinny rat came out of a trash can and the small animal nibbled on the corpse. The small and disgusting animal had been overcome by the desire to feed itself. There were small drops on the left side of its face. Samantha reflected to herself and found it ironic, to say the least, a rat being eaten by a rat. She turned her gaze to the second troublemaker. His face was pale and he was in shock. The other one was paralyzed and wet himself. He was not a threat. He looked at the child who had fainted. He could not tell if she had parents or not. After all, he did not even know her or know anything about her. But from the clothes she was wearing, she must be just another homeless person due to the tears and stains on her clothes, not to mention the smell. However, she could not leave her like that. It could be dangerous, and for now, she would keep her at home. With compassion for the child, she picked her up and took her home.

Cameron asked if she was okay, asking if the stab wound in his shoulder had healed. He looked down and his face showed guilt. He regretted it, considering himself to be the one to blame for this wound. Without reacting when he heard his forgiveness, Samantha reached out her hand to the young man's head and stroked it. It wasn't his fault at all. After all, she was the one who decided to intervene and she had no regrets about saving him.

When she heard those words, tears ran down her face and she noticed them beforehand and wiped them away by rubbing her arm. The boy must have been through many tragic moments even though he was just a child. He raised his head and smiled. For the first time in his life, he smiled of his own free will. In the past, he used to smile to mask his feelings, problems and traumas; but now, everything seemed so... Comfortable and welcoming. Even though he didn't say it directly, she was like a mother figure to him.  Samantha says she bought another fantasy book and this time he would find it interesting (she is teaching him to read, through fantasy books such as: ""The End Clock"" or ""The Braves of Argo"" that she will buy to help him with reading and make it fun and encourage him to learn more and more). However, it would be better for her to go to work now before they started, they would do that later. Cameron nodded and asked if she would like to buy a newspaper? Samantha took a coin and handed it to him. 

She walked through the busy streets, the incessant shouting of merchants selling their products, whether it was a charlatan who scammed the poor or market vendors who wanted to sell their spices before they went bad. Yes, all this commotion and the day had barely begun amidst the sunrise that illuminated more than ever. It was perhaps an omen of a day, a long and tortuous day that she loves so much.  As she passed through an alley, she noticed a group of stray ragtag people, there were three of them in total. Some had weapons, pieces of wood with nails and sharp weapons. She didn't look, because she didn't want to get involved in this fight. Samantha walked for a few more meters until suddenly, she stopped in front of a lamppost, looked at a certain poster stuck there, and noticed that it was a call for help, a child had gone missing. Her name was Cersei, she was four years old and obviously her parents must be desperate to find her. It also said that there would be a reward if someone could find the girl - for a moment she wanted to help and look for her right now - but she couldn't do that, at least not now - she had obligations to fulfill first.

After a long walk, she arrived and entered the place, there was the headquarters, the interior of the premises did not resemble a company at all - in fact, Samantha thought this place was more like a luxurious hotel.  The handrail of the stairs was made of wood, the floor was covered in a beige carpet that smelled nice, the chandelier lit up with its blazing bulbs (everything seemed to be made of wood). And of course the bureaucracy, with a lot of bureaucracy and employees so busy with wanted posters. To her left was a bunch of ragged guys who had gathered at a table looking at yet another wanted poster while they babble a plan to capture whoever it was; this is something quite common in this life of a bounty hunter, Samantha thought. If she were to imagine a chaotic job... this would certainly be the winner. She walked to a bench and sat down, not only to rest from the long walk here, but also to see other wanted posters and which one would have the appropriate price. Samantha had no intention of hunting someone too dangerous, it was not only because she was not willing to take the risk - but she also did not want to take the risk of... Leave More or less to the left was a man dressed in a mask, the most disturbing thing about it was not only the size of the money almost  exorbitant for him. He went by the name of Myers, he was a murderer. That was all there was to know about that guy. Underneath that poster, there was another one who was of the vampire species, a misshapen creature with a body of darkness as if the night sky had fallen to earth and taken on life and form. She continued to watch, until suddenly. An old man walked towards her with difficulty and used a cane to help him walk. The hermit sat down next to her, bending over and lightly slapping his spine in an attempt to alleviate a persistent and uncomfortable pain that was a consequence of his advanced age. He looked at Samantha, with his trembling and surrendered arm he pointed his index finger towards the woman in front of him and with a hoarse voice like a rock colliding with another. The old man asked if she was the famous heroine that so many lamented upon the hermit's return.  Without even giving her time to respond, the old man tells her how his grandson admires her greatly and mentions how he gets excited when listening to each of the epic stories about her magnanimous deeds and how his beloved grandson wanted to fight by her side in some battle.

She knew the hermit through gossip from the employees. He was a war veteran, his name was Kordon Woods and he had long been a bounty hunter; a great man in his youth and honored by justice and glamour in his battles where he would fight barbarians. A man with great power, but there was an enemy that not even the strongest warrior could defeat, ""time"" is the enemy of the strongest and the bravest. That hermit had dementia, he saw his grandchildren who were no longer in this world - he told hilarious stories about his wife who had died to a vampire who took her life while she slept - the man lost more and more, if he had one thing to say, it would be that the old man should continue with this illness, once they tried to hospitalize him and bring him back to his sobriety;  He panicked as if he were committing a serious sacrilege and exclaimed in a melancholic voice so that everyone could hear, he didn't want to wake up anymore, he didn't have the courage to face the painful reality where the only escape is this illusion where he lives. That wasn't a prison, but a paradise (how ironic, someone so brave and bold, regressed and out of fear decided to live in an illusion).",1,1733577876.0,EscritaFantasia,0,1.0,False

Alright, let‚Äôs talk music production ‚Äì it‚Äôs equal parts magic, madness, and frustration, but let‚Äôs face it, we wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. Whether you‚Äôre layering lush synths at 3 a.m. or fighting with that one snare sound that refuses to sit *just right* in the mix, we all know this journey is a wild ride. If you‚Äôre here, you‚Äôve probably felt the highs of nailing a mix and the lows of listening back to it the next day and wondering why you thought that kick was ‚Äúgenius.‚Äù  

But that‚Äôs what makes music production so incredible, right? It‚Äôs about chasing the perfect sound‚Äîeven if it takes forever (and sometimes it does). Here are some thoughts that keep popping into my head every time I open my DAW:  

- **No two tracks are the same.** What works for one song somehow *never* works for the next. You‚Äôre constantly learning, experimenting, failing, succeeding‚Äîand then failing harder.  
- **Creative flow always feels like a blessing.** Like, when everything just clicks and you hit that groove where you stop thinking and the music just... happens? Chef‚Äôs kiss. You‚Äôre channeling pure energy. Side note: Why does this *only* happen when you‚Äôre on the verge of collapsing from exhaustion? üòÇ  
- But then, **there‚Äôs also the ""WHY IS THIS SO HARD?!"" stage.** Every loop starts to sound like nails on a chalkboard. You‚Äôve been listening to the same four bars for two hours. Multiple existential crises. That‚Äôs normal, right?  

### Tips for Staying Sane (ish):  

1. **Don‚Äôt get trapped in the ‚Äòperfect mix‚Äô rabbit hole.** It‚Äôs productive procrastination at best. No one‚Äôs coming over with a spectrum analyzer before they decide if they like your track‚Äîjust sayin‚Äô.  
2. **A crappy first draft is better than nothing.** If you wait for inspiration to start, you‚Äôll just keep procrastinating. Lay down whatever comes out and sculpt it later (trust me, even your favorite producers started with garbage versions).  
3. **Take breaks, small AND big.** Step away for a coffee. Step away for a day. Heck, step away for a week if you‚Äôre fried. Your ears (and your brain) will thank you.    

And let‚Äôs not forget the technology side of things‚Ä¶ UGH. DAWs, plugins, hardware‚Äîyou‚Äôve gotta love working in an endless rabbit hole of new software updates, audio drivers glitching, and ‚Äúuh oh, why can‚Äôt my interface find my mic?‚Äù  

### Me to My Gear on Any Given Day:  
- *Why is this MIDI controller lighting up but not sending a signal?! MAKE IT MAKE SENSE, ARGH!*  
- *Welp, there go three hours troubleshooting settings instead of making literally *any* music.*  
- *Ok, now we‚Äôre good... why does it still sound bad?! Oh, wait, it‚Äôs me. Damn‚Ä¶ time to mix properly.*  

But on the flip side, when you finally figure out that one workflow hack that lets you *fly*? The best feeling in the world. No sensation beats the sheer satisfaction of listening to something you‚Äôve made, even if no one else hears it.  

### Tools Don‚Äôt Equal Talent  
It‚Äôs worth saying: gear envy won‚Äôt make your beats slap. Sure, having a fancy keyboard or expensive monitors might feel like a shortcut, but great music comes from honing skills, not buying toys. Learn to work your setup inside-out first. Build the creativity, then upgrade later. Gucci plugins don‚Äôt guarantee good songs‚Äîit‚Äôs still about heart and effort, not just fancy things blinking in LED.  

### Lastly‚ÄîCelebrate the Little Wins  
- Finally EQ‚Äôd that muddy bassline? Pat yourself on the back.  
- Exported your first rough demo? Huge milestone.  
- Avoided smashing something during a tech issue meltdown? Truly heroic.  

At the end of the day, music production isn‚Äôt about making life easier‚Äîit‚Äôs about embracing a process that‚Äôs messy and wonderful. What‚Äôs your favorite (or most chaotic) moment in production? Share your story!  

Let‚Äôs keep the grind going‚Äîand remember, somewhere out there, someone‚Äôs already bouncing their head to that beat you‚Äôre working on like it‚Äôs fire.",1,1733577675.0,Songstuff,0,1.0,False

Tour vs. self guided recs for a week in Chiang Mai,"I'll be in Chiang Mai for NYE and staying for a week. Hotel-wise we'll be splitting our time between the old part of the city and a resort in the mountains to the west. We're adventurous and would like to explore hiking trails and nature outside of the city but wondering about the best way to tackle this and also which locations are truly worth it after reading a lot of mixed reviews.

Please chime in with your thoughts on the following and whether you think they're best done using an organized Get Your Guide-type tour or hiring a driver to take us to places. Also please note- I will be 5 months pregnant and have zero interest in renting a motorbike to do the driving ourselves.

Here's what I have:

1. Monks Trail to Wat Pha Lat and Doi Suthep.

I'm leaning towards doing this on our own but please let me know if you feel we'll get more out of the experience on a guided tour. I'm especially intrigued by the night tours I've seen offered, which are in the $20/pp range and would include transport to/from our hotel, but again, is this also something we could just do on our own with grabs/taxis? Feel free to convince me I should book a tour. Or don't. I like the idea of being on our own time.

2. Bua Tong Waterfall

A friend recommended I avoid this because of the risk of slipping and falling but I'm not overly concerned ... I'm an athlete, have a lot of climbing/hiking experience, and feel totally normal doing all of my regular physical activities (running, lifting, competitive tennis). Not asking for medical advice here ... but am I wrong in thinking this doesn't look like this is a particularly physically demanding or overly dangerous activity? If I decided not to climb on it, is it a waste to go there? My bigger concern is whether it'll feel like an overly crowded tourist trap over the first week of January. Picture-wise it looks like there are a lot more awe-inspiring waterfalls elsewhere but I'm intrigued by this one. Skip or go for it?

3. Doi Inthanon

I love the idea of exploring this park and have researched several trails and waterfalls that sound amazing. I understand that a guide is needed and that it's a far drive from the city so we'd need to either join a tour or hire a driver for the day and then hire a guide at the park, right? My concerns include whether the tours are worth it or just a way to shuffle us to places where we get a hard sell on buying local crafts and coffee from locals. I've also read a ton of reviews from visitors complaining the views from the top are essentially just clouds or fog. What's the best way to escape into this park for the day without getting tourist trapped?

Clearly I‚Äôm not worth that effort. I find it funny too because I love sucking, I love sex, I‚Äôm good at it too! & (yes I'm attractive) So I know this isn‚Äôt a boredom or libido thing. I can‚Äôt talk to him about it because it gets me no where. He just thinks I‚Äôm a typical woman that he needs to shut the conversation with ü•±. He also never does this when we are f**king. But what I‚Äôm most tired of is when things have been ‚Äòbetter‚Äô or from where I‚Äôm standing right now ‚Äòfake nice‚Äô we f**k every day for like a week and it‚Äôs amazing. Then we argue & it stops. We only fuck if i literally do the work myself. (By work I mean the effort and work he should put in to rectify being vile to me) it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs depriving me of sex, why should I miss out because you‚Äôve been vile and refuse to put it right? but if I went and f**ked someone else he‚Äôd have loads to say about that. I am bored and I am sick of not being f**ked while he just sits sweating looking at women on a screen. I watch porn myself when I need too but it‚Äôs not the same for me as being railed by a man. I want sex, not this try stuff that makes me feel single af despite putting up with all this shit. It‚Äôs also not even that I care. I have no issue my man watching porn etc but it‚Äôs just becoming a major ick now. I didn‚Äôt sign up to this to be neglected and not f**ked. I am also getting so angry with the fact that no matter how hard I try, I cannot move out and find my own place without making huge sacrifices to myself like losing furniture I need to keep or losing my pets etc. So I‚Äôd really rather he just sort himself out and be a decent f**cking partner.

One such product that never goes out of style is slush drinks. These colorful, refreshing, and tasty beverages are enjoyed by customers of all ages. Whether it‚Äôs a hot summer day or a fun event, slush drinks appeal to a wide variety of people. But how can you effectively introduce slushies to your business? The answer lies in investing in a **commercial slush puppie machine**.

A **commercial slush puppie machine** is more than just a piece of equipment‚Äîit‚Äôs an investment in your business's future. From increasing revenue to enhancing customer experience, this machine can transform the way you serve drinks and elevate your offerings. In this article, we will explore everything you need to know about these machines, from their benefits to how to choose the right one, as well as how to maximize their potential for your business.

**What is a Commercial Slush Puppie Machine?**

A **commercial slush puppie machine** is a specialized appliance used to make slush drinks in high volumes. These machines are designed for use in busy commercial settings like convenience stores, ice cream shops, fast food restaurants, amusement parks, and more. The machine works by blending ice and flavored syrup to create the icy, slushy texture that makes slush drinks so refreshing and enjoyable.

These machines typically have one or more tanks, each capable of holding different flavors of slush. They work by continuously stirring the mixture, which ensures that the ice stays finely shaved and the drink remains smooth. A high-quality commercial slush puppie machine can produce large quantities of slush quickly, making it an ideal solution for high-demand environments.

**Why Slush Drinks Are So Popular**

Slush drinks are beloved for several reasons. Their cold, icy texture and bold, vibrant flavors make them a refreshing treat for people of all ages. Here‚Äôs why slush drinks are always in demand:

**Universal Appeal**

Slush drinks are universally loved. From kids at birthday parties to adults at sporting events, everyone enjoys the refreshing chill of a slush. The variety of flavors available‚Äîfrom fruity combinations to unique tropical flavors‚Äîensures that there‚Äôs something for everyone.

**Customizable Flavors**

One of the best things about slush drinks is the ability to customize them. Whether you want a classic flavor like cherry or grape, or a more adventurous combination like blue raspberry and watermelon, slush drinks can be tailored to suit anyone‚Äôs taste. This customization makes them a perfect option for offering variety without increasing complexity in the kitchen.

**Low-Cost Ingredients, High-Profit Margins**

The basic ingredients for slush drinks‚Äîwater, ice, and flavored syrup‚Äîare relatively inexpensive. This low cost of production means that slushies provide high profit margins, making them a smart addition to any menu. For businesses looking to boost their bottom line without increasing overhead, a **commercial slush puppie machine** offers a cost-effective solution.

**Benefits of Investing in a Commercial Slush Puppie Machine**

Investing in a **commercial slush puppie machine** can have a significant impact on your business. Here are some of the key benefits:

**1. Increased Sales**

Slush drinks are a highly attractive product for customers, and adding a slush machine to your business is a great way to increase sales. During peak seasons like summer, slush drinks are in high demand, and having a slush machine readily available can encourage more impulse purchases.

Whether you're running a concession stand at an amusement park, a food truck at a festival, or a convenience store in a busy neighborhood, slush drinks can boost your sales by appealing to a wide range of customers. And because slush machines can produce high volumes quickly, they‚Äôre perfect for handling the increased demand during busy times.

**2. Low Operational Costs**

One of the most attractive features of a **commercial slush puppie machine** is its low operational cost. Since slush drinks are made with just a few simple ingredients‚Äîflavored syrup, ice, and water‚Äîthe cost to produce them is relatively low. Additionally, slush machines are highly automated, meaning less labor is required for preparation and serving. This saves on staff time and ensures efficient operation.

Moreover, modern slush machines are designed to be energy-efficient, so you won‚Äôt have to worry about high electricity bills. When used properly, a commercial slush machine is a low-maintenance piece of equipment that offers excellent return on investment (ROI).

**3. Attract More Customers**

People are naturally drawn to slush drinks due to their colorful appearance, fun texture, and refreshing taste. When customers see a slush machine in your business, they‚Äôre likely to be curious and want to try it out. The vibrant colors of slush drinks also make them great for social media posts, encouraging customers to snap pictures and share their experience with friends.

A **commercial slush puppie machine** can also be a point of differentiation for your business. Many competitors may not offer slush drinks, so having a slush machine can set your business apart and help attract more customers who are looking for a fun, refreshing treat.

**4. Easy to Use and Maintain**

Using and maintaining a **commercial slush puppie machine** is relatively simple. Once the machine is set up and stocked with the appropriate ingredients, it does most of the work for you. The machine automatically blends the ice and syrup, creating a smooth, consistent slush every time.

Most slush machines are equipped with self-cleaning features or come with easy-to-remove components that simplify the cleaning process. This makes it easy to maintain the machine and ensures that your equipment stays in good working condition for years to come.

**Choosing the Right Commercial Slush Puppie Machine for Your Business**

When selecting a **commercial slush puppie machine**, there are several important factors to consider to ensure you choose the best model for your needs. Here‚Äôs what to look for:

**1. Capacity**

The capacity of the slush machine is an essential consideration. If you expect high customer traffic and need to serve a large number of slush drinks quickly, you‚Äôll want a machine with a larger tank and higher output. Many commercial slush machines offer multiple tanks, allowing you to serve different flavors simultaneously and increase your service speed.

For smaller businesses or locations with lower demand, a single-tank machine might be sufficient. The key is to match the machine‚Äôs capacity with your expected sales volume to avoid overloading or running out of stock during busy periods.

**2. Durability**

A **commercial slush puppie machine** needs to be durable enough to withstand the rigors of a commercial environment. Look for a machine made from high-quality, rust-resistant materials such as stainless steel. Stainless steel is durable, easy to clean, and resistant to wear and tear, making it ideal for high-volume environments.

Check for additional durability features, such as reinforced components and high-quality seals, to ensure the machine can handle frequent use and continue performing well for years.

**3. Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**

Since slush machines deal with syrup and ice, it‚Äôs essential to choose a machine that‚Äôs easy to clean and maintain. Look for a **commercial slush puppie machine** that features removable parts like dispensing nozzles and drip trays. Machines with self-cleaning options or automatic rinsing cycles can also save you time and effort on maintenance.

A clean machine is essential not only for hygiene but also for maintaining the machine‚Äôs performance. Regular cleaning ensures that your slush drinks are always fresh, and the machine runs efficiently without any issues.

**4. Energy Efficiency**

Running a slush machine constantly can add up in energy costs. To minimize overhead, opt for a machine that has energy-saving features, such as an automatic shut-off function or temperature regulation that reduces unnecessary power consumption. An energy-efficient machine not only reduces costs but also helps make your business more environmentally friendly.

**5. Customization Options**

Many modern slush machines offer a variety of customization options, from flavor mixing to slush texture settings. These features allow you to offer a wide range of flavors and create unique slush drinks that keep customers coming back for more. Some machines even offer the ability to serve different types of frozen beverages, such as frozen cocktails or frozen coffee drinks, allowing you to diversify your offerings.

**Maximizing the Potential of Your Commercial Slush Puppie Machine**

Once you‚Äôve invested in the right **commercial slush puppie machine**, you‚Äôll want to ensure that you‚Äôre maximizing its potential. Here are a few strategies to help you get the most out of your investment:

**1. Offer a Variety of Flavors**

One of the easiest ways to keep customers interested in your slush offerings is by offering a variety of flavors. While classic flavors like cherry and grape are always popular, consider offering seasonal or themed flavors that change throughout the year. This could include fruity flavors in the summer, spiced or pumpkin flavors in the fall, or holiday-themed slush drinks during the winter months.

By rotating flavors regularly, you‚Äôll encourage customers to visit more often to try new options, which can increase repeat business and customer loyalty.

**2. Upsell and Cross-Sell**

Maximize your sales by upselling slush drinks. Offer larger sizes for just a small price difference or suggest adding extra toppings, such as whipped cream, candy pieces, or sprinkles. You can also cross-sell slushies with other items on your menu. For example, offer slush drinks as part of a combo deal with a snack or meal.

**3. Promote on Social Media**

Slush drinks are perfect for social media. Their colorful and eye-catching appearance makes them perfect for sharing online. Use platforms like Instagram and Facebook to showcase your slush offerings. Run promotions, post images of new flavors, and encourage customers to share their photos. This can help generate buzz and attract more customers to your business.

**4. Host Special Events**

Consider hosting special events that feature slush drinks. You could have ""Slush Happy Hours"" with discounted slush drinks, or offer free slush tastings for large groups or events. These types of promotions can generate excitement around your business and bring in new customers who are eager to try your slush drinks.

**Conclusion**

Investing in a **commercial slush puppie machine** is a smart move for any business looking to offer a fun, refreshing product that customers love. With its low operational costs, high-profit margins, and universal appeal, slush drinks can quickly become a core offering that drives traffic, boosts sales, and enhances customer satisfaction. By selecting the right machine and maximizing its potential, you can create a memorable experience for your customers and set your business apart from the competition.

I bought a photo printer and want to keep an album of our pictures from travel. So last night I was looking at photos of us on his phone (we have always given eachother our passwords and been very open about our phones) that I can use for the album. 

A text popped up ""ü•≤"" from a woman's name I never heard of. I click the text, and there is no conversation. mind you, I'm an android user I don't really know how iphones work. I thought it might be an old friend so I left it alone and went back to the photo album. 

but it kept gnawing at me. we tell eachother everything and he has never mentioned someone by this name in the past 12 months we've been together. I end up going back to the message app to see what I can find, and lo and behold you can recover deleted messages. There's about 177 deleted messages between them, as recent as yesterday.

I instantly started to cry. he was asleep. I only saw the last few messages ""I miss you"" ""hey there beautiful"", etc. I didn't read anything else.

I put the phone back and silently cried myself to sleep. this morning I acted completely normal and even got up and made him coffee. he gave me a kiss and went to work.

Now that I've been sitting with it for a while, I want to see wtf they've been talking about. I've never been cheated on before, and he hid it so damn well. I'm afraid if I bring it up, all the evidence will be permanently deleted and I won't have the courage to leave him. I need to feel all the pain and betrayal that was said and done so I know that there is no recovering this relationship. 

I'm thinking of pretending nothing is wrong just for today and going back tonight to see what they have been talking about. 

Do you think this is the right thing to do? I've fully moved in now, I can't just up and leave overnight. I moved from across the country. any advice is appreciated. thank you",2,1733576702.0,CheatersConfronted,2,0.75,False

1h8s1nl,https://i.redd.it/ct7klibadf5e1.jpeg,Heart felt funny this morning - ECG looks strange ,"First 10 seconds match with time palpitations were felt. Had them before but lasted about an hour this morning on and off and was more intense than normal. 27M 1.5 hours daily exercise (outdoor walking and strength training), seemingly healthy. No other symptoms than the weird chest thumping and fluttering whilst at rest this morning (what I assume is palpitations). Rarely drink coffee (once or twice a week), don't drink alcohol. 

I did post earlier but was notified in comments I had attached a 3 second screenshot rather than full 30 second and it wouldn't let me edit the post so apologies for the multiple posting. Had about 4 ECGs consecutively like the one above and 30 minutes later back to normal textbook ECG. AW10 is new (week old) and the couple times I tested it a week ago it all looked normal. Did not adjust the watch between when I got weird readings (which matched exactly with my symptoms), and when the ECG looked normal (feeling of palpitations had gone). Watch kept very clean following Apple guidelines so no dirt on sensors. 

Just wondering if this requires a trip to the doctors as it says online palpitations are pretty normal so no need to do anything about it. Or whether the first 10 seconds are so abnormal that it couldn't possible be a legit reading

Good afternoon you wonderful people. I wish you all joy and happiness regardless of which side of the coin/faith journey you find yourselves. I envy ignorance sometimes. I tell myself I stopped believing; I try to remind myself that it‚Äôs no so much that, it‚Äôs the fact I desperately wanted to believe until I found it no longer possible with the knowledge and putting things apples to apples. It‚Äôs amazing how much circular reasoning and peer pressure work in the confirmation bias. Glad to be out of Utah.

In terms of the why I am transitioning my faith, please see the previous post on my profile.

Given my circumstances : TBM, RM married in the temple with a beautiful baby and having devoted families on both sides I‚Äôm considering the following:

1. At this point I consider myself a Christian. (Just because the church relies on selective reasoning and information doesn‚Äôt mean my testimony of deity is a sham) This church is as good as any to bind a child to Christ. I will not force participation, but feel that religion and a structured youth is productive. Besides if this church is false it sure as hell isn‚Äôt any of the others‚Ä¶ (that is of course if it gets reformed like they say it will)

2. 0 desire to really change any aspects of my life personally. Tithing will get a great reduction. I‚Äôll pay just enough so I can keep my paid membership to attend sibling weddings

3. My spouse is aware of the PIMO but not entirely to the level I‚Äôm at, I‚Äôll be communicating this as I‚Äôm asked. I have no desire to steer others away. Especially when I have no desire to drink or break any Mormon commandments that no longer have a bearing on my life (family substance abuse history)

4. Church history and doctrine is changing per the suits in SLC bidding. I‚Äôll take anything spouted from the mouth of a Mormon with a grain of salt. Same as the ward members on Sundays

5. Serving in the primary is fun. I won‚Äôt be caught bearing testimony of anything besides god and Christ but these kids will be taught per the parents wishes, if a calling is minimal effort I‚Äôll serve.

6. For talks if asked I‚Äôll simply keep it on Christ 

7. Temple visits will be sparse. While absolutely freemasonry hash and visuals paired with scripture it always made for nice meditation.

8. Lots of friends in the church. I don‚Äôt have to change that.

9. The church has its good and I see no reason where I‚Äôm 14k deep in donations to cause an upheaval to my life. I‚Äôll ride the waves and dodge the rocks

10. Cafeteria style Mormonism is where I find myself. I‚Äôll try coffee and let you know if it‚Äôs even anything to moan about not having.

11. Further proving how false discernment is, I‚Äôll be lying for meetings, recommends etc. I‚Äôll keep yall updated 


So with my current outlook, any advice from yall? Anything you‚Äôve learned/regretted in the PIMO lifestyle? Ways to keep the marriage intact? Raising kids in it? Things you‚Äôd advise ?",5,1733576532.0,exmormon,2,1.0,False

Back in school, I actually had friends, but as time passed, we took different paths. Some got into drugs, some focused only on having fun and hanging out, while others got into relationships and drifted away. I chose a different path, the path of solitude.

I started learning various things like community building, marketing, and boxing. I even started going to the gym and hanging out with random women because I was tired of being a virgin. The reason I‚Äôm writing this is that today, I saw one of my oldest friends talking about trivial things like love someone had a crush on him, and he had a crush on someone else. At that moment, I realized how lonely I‚Äôve become.

Now, I don‚Äôt have a social circle. I‚Äôm a certified barista, a certified personal trainer, and I‚Äôm 20 years old. I‚Äôm planning to go to the USA soon for a BBA degree because I feel like I need one. I was previously enrolled in Tribhuvan University, but I dropped out.

The truth is, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing or where I‚Äôm going. Everyone around me seems to be enjoying life with new friends and new relationships, but here I am, alone, working hard. I‚Äôve become physically strong and look good because of my physique and low body fat percentage, but now what?

I‚Äôm a certified personal trainer, I can make great coffee as a barista, I can fight, and I maintain a good physique because I go to the gym but now what? Looking good, being fit, and having skills, what does it all mean when I have no one to share it with? I feel stuck and lost.

I have no social circle to share these accomplishments with or show off to. It‚Äôs such a strange and overwhelming feeling. Maybe this post makes me sound crazy, but I feel better sharing it. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this, I truly appreciate it and again thank you so much

1h8rzmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1h8rzmw/i_think_i_ruined_my_marriage_and_it_will_not_be/,I think I ruined my marriage and it will not be fixed,"So I screwed things up badly and ruined everyone's lives, more or less.

It's a long story, but basically she doesn't feel emotionally safe, seen, appreciated, or loved; partly due to a lack of support and some conflicts during a critical time 10 years ago (I was trying, but I made some wrong choices, like leaving the house for a few hours when shouting and screaming started, communicating something in a way that she perceived as mocking her, or leaving for the office if i had a critical piece of work to finish and couldnt do a big fight). Also due to me shutting her down when she tries to bring up these conflicts now. She feels like she's always had to play a role with me and couldn't be herself. That I'm so cold and unemotional.

I listened carefully, took accountability, asked what I could do to make things better, promised to listen, accept and validate her feelings, go to relationship therapy, and be more open with my feelings and affectionate with her. She said we can fix it and she still loves me, but I don't believe it because she's been untruthful about a lot of big things - she often says what she thinks I want to hear rather than the truth. To figure her out I often need to look at behaviour more than words.

This all happened when she was away on a work trip. So I started calling, texting affectionate things, and being open with my admittedly sometimes big and difficult feelings that I kept suppressed due to being in survival mode for so many years. She initially said she loved it, and reciprocated, then suddenly said it was too much for her and stopped (we had talked for 40 minutes over 3 days). I didn't push and said I respect her need but I feel so bad now, because I think she tried being in love with me again and didn't like it.

Her Spotify is full of songs about falling out bedroom and refusing to forgive your lover. She kicked me out of the bedroom a month ago. When she heard my aunt and uncle (whom she barely knows) were getting divorced, she was so happy for my aunt. She even told me we need to plan what we're going to do if we get divorced one day. When I asked if she was thinking of divorcing me, she denied it - but after a  big pause. She said I was the cause of a burnout episode at work and her depression and anxiety (which is real and severe). Been real cagey with the finances lately.

I'm just blind sided by this. I'm a stay at home dad now, and all I do is work and take care of her and the kids. I did this 3 years ago to support her and the kids better (tried going back to work but couldn't get childcare). I do this like 14 hours a day every day. I make special meals for her, get up before her and make a coffee and breakfast for her every morning, hug her, kiss her, tell her I love her. When she's sad or anxious about something I usually listen to her and try to support her, but can't always due to three young kids and being tge only one to do domestic stuff. She almost never does childcare or housework and I don't complain; I just know she needs to rest and manage her stress so I don't push it. Always stayed up with the baby when she was fussy, always got up to feed her at night  I do my best to show I love and care but it's not enough; something is just so wrong with me. Give me long enough and I screw everything up. I'm 100% committed to fixing it but I think it's too late.

Our lives are ruined since we recently relocated to a foreign country for her job, and if we get divorced, I can't stay. I'll need to relocate to the other side of the world. Kids basically lose one parent. I lose the love of my life and am condemned to poverty (no child care spaces in my country and my career is killed from stay at home parenting). She either gets to learn the real challenges of parenting, spend nearly her whole income on a team of nannies to replace me (she has a very busy job that involves a lot of travel), or the loses her kids if they come with me. I am so committed to this relationship and I thought that would be the only way to make things work; but it looks like instead of working I just threw the rest of my life away. I have no career, no friends, my own family doesn't really care about me. I'm just done now.

I dunno, can it be fixed?

TLDR: Wife doesn't feel emotionally safe with me and likely doesn't love me anymore or want to be in a relationship. I want to fix it but it's too late I think. Really screwed up everyone's lives. Can we fix it?

The reason I titled the post the way I did is because im in recovery from alcohol abuse, and this has absolutely tested every fiber of my sober life. I sat outside a liquor store last night and i called every best friend/sponsor/support i had to not go in. I was in tears. I was a mess. All i wanted was a bottle of Titos vodka to make the pain go away.

My support saved me, I didnt go in. I went home I cried and I fell asleep. 

Waking up today, knowing i didnt do anything stupid was incredibly liberating. As i sit here writing this im drinking coffee. I'm watching my favorite morning show. I'm going to the gym next to be the absolute best version of myself.

This subredddit is saving my life and I cannot thank you all enough for the support.

So much love,

She came over one time and with tears and love in her eyes said that her mom is gonna be upset at her if she doesnt break up with me as whatrver she told her mom didnt seem like i wasnt doing enough for her in her moms eyes i tried to do more and more for her but truly it was to check off the boxes for her mom rather than be intentional. I did a ton of growing and trying to be a better man, and she went against her mom originally and stated with me for about another 1-2 months she would have complaints like ‚Äúif he wanted to he would‚Äù ‚Äúa guy goes above and beyond for the girl he wants‚Äù and truly all she wanted was to be extra reassured now. I didnt understand those complaints then but eventually i guess the pot boiled over because i didnt under her emotional complaints. I just became dissmive and wuite and didn‚Äôt say anything in those moments since i didnt know what to say. But anyways around the six month mark she tried to breakup with me once because i started ignoring her for about 8 hours which i guess made her super anxious she did something dumb and we got over it but i ended up messaging her on twitter telling her im on the way as she sent that text instantly started blocking me everywhere. I reached out through one line and drove over and we fixed things for about a year. It was something super small and dumb. But i told her from that point forward if she ever tries to breakup with me i will let her since that means she doesnt want this. Well low and behold some time ago i guess the same thing happened but this time i could tell looking back she was looking to breakup with me she definitely wasnt 100% sure. But she came over and said she doesnt think things will ever be easy between us and i could tell she broke up in love and i didnt fight for her i let her go but the way she said things and approached things was different then a girl trying to let me down softy it trully seemed in the moment in front if me she was looking for one reason to stay. And this girl loved me hard man gave her 110% for our relationship. So i know she wanted it to work, the day after we broke up we had the most bittersweet breakup and goodbye filled with love and promises of her saying this isnt the end we just need to grow a but together and i did nothing wrong. But i asked to call her the next day we were on the phone for 4 hours crying and reminiscing but on that phone call i was able to say i had to be doing or not doing somethingbecause i know she wanted it to work and she agreed. And said that she had been feeling like ‚Äúthis for awhile‚Äù. So i told her im going to work on myself and i just hope she will accept me back once im better. I really didnt know at the time what i was doing wrong or not doing. She said she would accept me back in a heartbeat, and she hopes it feels like it did in the beginning. I then watched her repost and like things about still being in love with me and after i reached out that first week she said she is confused about what she wants and what she needs. So i just hearted it, it was a really big message, and after i didnt respond to it i got my number blocked. I then watched the reposts go to us not being compatible but im a good guy, to bittersweet ones waiting for me to come back. Then turned bitter, and she saw a tik tok that said i manipulated her and she shoved a guy in my face the next day after reposting that, but then immediately went onto twitter to like 3 things. 
1 somethings arent worth fixing move on
2 somethimes we expect more from ithers because she would do it for them
3 youre going to hurt a lit and you will be okay again. 

When we were on the phone she said it just sucks that we cant do this together like me work on myself and such and i said i dont know why i didnt when you gave me the chance. And boy oh bot that cane around to bite me she never actually gave me the chance but she did try to bring up how she was feeling to me and i just didnt understand her. But then the reposts got extremely bitter and things like the mire chances you give people the less they will value you the more they are going to disrespect you. I never wver once disrespected nor rose my hand or anything but at the same time i wasnt getter her w ton of flowers and meeting her emotional needs. She reposted how hard it it is to walk away from someone tou adore because they jeep not meeting your emotional needs. But she then eventually slowly unfollowed and then blocked me on twitter and then everywhere else exactly 48 hours later i sent one apology text and she reposted and took more jabs at me for it. But some if those reposts and such were so heartbreaking and sad): she truly broke up in love. But i eventually a month after being blocked everywhere sent a text that i felt put all of her emotions and things that she was trying to see from social media together and tokd her if she wants me to fight for her ill move mountains i did have to push this text through since i was blocked everywhere. I also sent one email pouring my heart out but she turned bitter qnd i was blocked everywhere by then. I aslo gave a small hand written note and card on her car that first week, talking about getting coffee with her one day, since we started as fwb and hith wish we gor coffee instead since neither of us thought it would turn into what it did. But after i door dashed flowers to her store not knowing she worked she called me in the doir dashers number and said ‚Äúdont ever fucking try to contact me again if you do ill call the authorities go fuck yourself i sont want you‚Äù and by the way only me and her bestfriend followed her on social media and at first it was about wanting me and such. Now im just sitting here wondering what changed? Twlling me she would take me back in a heartbeat to telling me never contact her again. At first i thought she was tryna let me down softly so i didnt fight for her but i realize now that was definitely not the case there were things bother her even when we were our happiest and i saw that look in the eye even when we broke up i saw the look of love, she would say ‚Äú i just think things would be easier if we found eachother later‚Äù she pretty much careied the first year of iur relationship and courted me so our dynamics got flip flopped. Im just wondering will i ever hear from or get another chance? Some more details in there too but she broke up in love, and from her side felt like i gave the bare minimum and i learned recently if i feel like i wasnt giving the bare minimum and she felt i was both our true it doesnt invalidate her feelings wish i learned all of this sooner. I just want another chance lioking back i didnt have the skilks to meet her when i did and id do anything to make it work. But it has been 7 months post BU now. Not a peep and the call on door dashers number, but she tried to get my attention for a month and a half. Looking back if i woulda fought for her it‚Äôd probably have worked. And now i don‚Äôt know if ill ever hear from her again. Havent tried to go around the block since just had to show her im willing to fight but she sounds done now, done for good i don‚Äôt know?

1h8rt4d,https://i.redd.it/v7x7k0rvaf5e1.jpeg,My perfume decant party went well,"
The other day I posted about having some friends over to smell some perfumes and decant what they liked and here‚Äôs a wrap up:


Originally, I had 5 girls coming, but ended up with 3 which I think was more manageable when it came to decanting at the end. I sprayed each on a paper strip and passed them around. I intended for them to try things on their skin, but it never came to that. I took notes on what they said after each, I‚Äôll use initials A, B, and C to differentiate their first thoughts. I provided each with¬† the choice of 4 decants, so they selected what they liked best to take home at the end.


*Calvin Klein Euphopria. 2/3 decanted*

A-Very classy. Smells very fancy. Special occasion perfume. May wear to fancy event this week. Decanted
¬†
B- I love this! Reminds me of Christmas at my moms. Decanted
¬†
C- no notes, liked it fine

¬†
*Ariana Grande Thank U, Next 2/3 decanted*

A- Polar Opposite of the first one (Euphoria). Very spring/summer. This would be good for a baby shower or a summer wedding
¬†
B-Very fresh. Garden party perfume. Decanted and wore the next day. Mentioned compliments from coworkers
¬†
¬†C-No notes, but she chose to decant
¬†
¬†
*Mugler Angel 2019 EDT 1/3 decanted*

A-No
¬†
B and C- no notes. Nobody loves. B ended up decanting

¬†
*Michael Kors Wonderlust- 3/3 decanted*
¬†
This one surprised me by being an instant crowd favorite. Nobody really talks about this perfume but it‚Äôs a lovely powdery almondy lime.

A- (excited!) Perfect. Potent without being overwhelming.
¬†
B-Daily wear perfume. Signature scent worthy
¬†
¬†C-No notes, but loves it.

¬†
*Montblanc Signature- 1/3 decanted (one of my FAVORITES)*
¬†
A-Not my favorite
¬†
B-Strong but not overpowering
¬†
C-Likes. Chose to decant

¬†
*Juliette Has a Gun Not a Perfume- 1/3 decanted*
¬†
A-Am I smelling this? I smell something I think and I think I like it. What am I smelling? (I then try it on my skin) I am not sure what‚Äôs happening but I like it. Decanted
¬†
B-Smells like krazy glue
¬†
¬†C-Do not like

¬†
*Versace Crystal Noir 1/3 decanted (one of my favorites)*

A-Nice but not for every day
¬†
B-Smells like a clean man out of the shower
¬†
C-Likes and chose to decant

¬†
*Britney Spears Fantasy 0/3 decanted*
¬†
A-Young person‚Äôs perfume. College girls perfume. Use before a frat party. Looks familiar, smells familiar. Maybe previous college roommate had it.
¬†
B-Eh. Bubblegummy. Would not want to wear this
¬†
¬†C-Not a fan

¬†
At this point A has only chosen 3 and mentioned loving the smell of the coffee grounds I had out. I ran upstairs and grabbed *Sofia Vergara Love* for her to try, she loved it and chose to decant this for her fourth. The other girls were happy with their original choices and passed on this.
¬†
All around it was super fun, I‚Äôd do it again. It got a little messy when it came for me to decant. I bought liquid syringes which went quickly except the Angel which had to be sprayed. They had a good time. 10/10 would recommend for anybody with a huge collection wanting to spread the wealth. I am now roughly 36mls lighter and barely made a dent in these bottles.",5,1733575794.0,FemFragLab,1,1.0,False

The Christmas tree we picked up together last night to celebrate our second Christmas together is twinkling in the corner and our stockings are hanging on the fireplace. 
We met when we were both 45 and are both close to 47 now. For me 46(f) it was after a 15 year marriage followed by some very bad romances for 5 years. For him 46(m) it was after an adulthood of failed romances. 
Neither of us thought we would meet the right person that would fit for us this late in life. 
This year has been a difficult one for me including our main water line popping a leak late last night which means my water is off right now. 
However I am warm, loved, hopeful and capable. And after getting a little bit more snuggles and coffee,  I‚Äôll be heading out in the cold to pick up the parts I need to fix our busted water pipe. 
I was fortunate to have a knowledgeable and loving dad that taught me how to do those sorts of things. 
Also, my parents are still together and are only 25 minutes away. 
I am feeling blessed and grateful today!

I tried reaching out to WOW but because they said I couldn't take MA since it was 13 weeks i was devastated, but before that I saw some post in the blue app that sold pills and I bought one because I thought it was still safe to take MA, but after I did some research about MA here I saw many similar cases where they bought pills locally and then they failed and the pills were fake the person who sold the pill to me instructed me to do a lot of things, 1 week of preparation like heavy exercise 15-20 mins 3x a day, drink primrose oil and drink black coffee, pineapple juice and ginger tea 3x a day, all that for a week before proceeding to take pills. Since I realized that it's not really safe to continue, I read about SA in Thailand (Klongtun Hosp) its  the most safe way to do, since I'm 14 weeks now and the problem is that I can't travel alone asap because I might just get offloaded so I'm waiting for my friends to get their passports before we book tickets and hotels. Their passports will arrive around Christmas so I'll be 17-19 weeks by that time so I'm really depressed. Because what if I'll get offloaded if i chose to travel alone because i wanna do it as soon as possible and because I just got my passport, so my bank and gcash accounts are newly opened, I don't have a bank statement to show if they ever look for it at the immigration. Because I also saw some stories about them being offloaded going to Thailand. Especially since I'm just a live streamer, freelancer, maybe I'll be tripped by the io and get offloaded, what requirements do I need to get ready? And if anyone has ever done SA here like 17 weeks or above in Thailand, what's your experience? Because I usually see posts here about people who have done SA at 14 weeks or less, I'm having anxiety because I haven't seen a single post about their experience with SA in Thailand above 17 weeks.",1,1733575552.0,abortion,4,1.0,False

I have the blessing of moving to Cebu in the next couple of days after living in Manila for 6 years. Originally from Sydney Australia, and now on the hunt for finding my feet in Cebu with little luxuries to help make it feel like home.

To be honest, it feels more like home being in Cebu with the mountains to the sea view setup which is SUPER like Sydney!

If anyone has suggestions for the following, I'd love to get some guidance:

- Santis Deli equivalent. In MNL there's Santis Deli which has great Italian cold cuts, cheeses and imported European goods. Anything similar around Cebu?

- A really, really, REALLY good smash burger. Like shake shack / sweet ecstasy level but better if possible hahaha

- run clubs, cycling clubs, gym buddies around Mandani / Parkmall area, ya boy needs to stay active hahahaa

- Wine bars, speakeasy setups, chill bars and if there's a central hub apart from IT park for nightlife.

- Rave scene, where does one indulge in this should one desire to participate? Once or twice a year though haha

- Weekend markets for food, crafts and trinkets. Any suggestions?

Their first mistake was going to the restaurant without a butler escort. Their second error was not their fault. They did exactly what they should in being denied a reservation when they want. They went to the YC concierge. Unfortunately they got an uninitiated newbie who said no reservations available 1-3 in the afternoon, fully booked. We had a similar event occur when on a prior cruise we wanted to book a future cruise when I saw a particular cabin I had my eye on open up. This RS goes fast and we could not wait for the open hours of FFC desk downstairs or in TSL to open. I went to concierge and asked for him to call the FFC manager and request an appointment. He was new and would only give me their hours. Fortunately veteran concierge Vishnu was next to him on the phone and was taking notice of my request. Vishnu told me to wait a moment to finish his call. He explained to the newbie that this is an amenity extended to the RS & OS category. I didn't realize I was a¬†**Lagniapper,**¬†until this moment. Vishnu called the manager of the Future Cruise and she said how about in one hour. Great. We met in the Top Sail Lounge at 1pm. (I tipped her $20 after booking).Lagniapper is pronounced Lanny, yapper.

""LAGNIAPPE. We picked up one excellent word--a word worth traveling to New Orleans to get; a nice limber, expressive, handy word--'lagniappe.' They pronounce it lanny-yap. It is Spanish--so they said. We discovered it at the head of a column of odds and ends in the Picayune, the first day; heard twenty people use it the second; inquired what it meant the third; adopted it and got facility in swinging it the fourth. It has a restricted meaning, but I think the people spread it out a little when they choose. It is the equivalent of the thirteenth roll in a 'baker's dozen.' It is something thrown in, gratis, for good measure. The custom originated in the Spanish quarter of the city. ... If the waiter in the restaurant stumbles and spills a gill of coffee down the back of your neck, he says 'For lagniappe, sah,' and gets you another cup without extra charge.""  
\- Life on the Mississippi Mark Twain 

So the poster's next step should have been to ask to see the YC Director. We Lagniappers must stick together and get all the perks and amenities due us.

Although most often diagnosed as PMDD or PMS or anxiety, I don't think that's exactly what's going on here. After having my daughter, my body went into this state of intense shock or change. I had issues with intense nausea, Vomitting, fatigue, anxiety, etc. It was most prominent when my period tried to come back, triggering the follicular cycle. This is still presently a thing. I had already tried number antipsychotics and my body doesn't handle them well, at all. I am currently working with a functional doctor and have also been diagnosed with SIBO. I've seen almost every specialist and ruled out so many things. Only during half of my cycle are my symptoms so bad. I did a little bit of reading and found that prostaglandins and histamine are highest during follicular, because the egg soon released can trigger an inflammatory response. I wonder if anyone else has noticed that things like cyclical changes can cause (what I'm now assuming to be MCAS?) it doesn't matter what I eat, what stomach medicine I take, what supplements I am on, every month, for the whole follicular period, I feel like dog poop.

Also does working out and coffee trigger it for you? Because apparently I have a low tolerance to that.

1h8r7ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h8r7ya/did_i_misread_the_signals/,Did I misread the signals?..,"Hello,

I (28M) and her (F34) met in work and work together in the same department for over 3 years and of those years, 2 of them after the first was when we got to know eachother on a deeper level

We have eachother on all socials and text/snapchat everyday holding a streak and send memes.

At first we were colleagues.. now we are close friends... (I hope)

We went on road trips, at the start it was a group 3.. as time went on we started hanging out together just the 2 of us... going shopping... getting food.. coffee.. cinema.... just the 2 of us... and we would do it without telling anyone and would do it in private. However we never labelled it as anything it was like a mutual agreement to go together.. 

This went on for some time... and eventually I found myself being loyal to her... she would be the first person I think of before falling asleep... the first person I think of when I wake up... the person who would pop into my mind when I see something in the shop.. the feelings started to grow stronger and stronger ....Heck I still remember when I was in a bar and some other girl took my hand during a conversation and I remember feeling so wrong because she immediately popped into my mind when it happened..

I would get her favourite snack/food when she comes with me in my car just to see her smile and be happy... again still no label.. no intentions... no moves were being made.. When we hang out... she would say.. 'my mom said hi to you' and I would tell her to give a 'Hi' back for me and I would ask her how her mom is..

When we talk to eachother we would gaze into eachothers eyes closely.. I can see her eyes dilate sometimes... in a group setting when someone makes a joke...we would look at eachother first to see eachothers reaction... she would unintentionally mimic my posture at the table... we look out for eachother in work and outside of work...

Even on her holidays.. she would still message me to tell me about her day and or keep the streak.. so to me I felt special...(at least I hope she didn't feel like she had to do it)

So eventually the 'What ifs' crept into my mind and started to take over... over 1 year of living in the 'What ifs' the imaginary land of scenarios that anyone would wish for to come true...

I couldn't hold it in anymore so I had to ask her knowing well enough that i would get rejected.. but if I never ask I will never know... and if I never know... I will just live in regret...

So I asked..""Have you ever thought about us being together?'

Her immediate response 'I think we are better as friends'

There was no stutter, the words were sharp and the sentence was clear.

I was immediately teleported back to reality..everything shattered...but I still hold my head up high acting as if nothing happened... in one way I'm happy I spoke up and gave clear intentions... on the other hand reality is harsh..

So after that, I think she's mad or angry at me... feeling a little awkward... and uncomfortable... but in work... I acted like nothing happened.. putting on a mask for her sake... talking and treating her the same... for her.

Yes, it hurts me deeply on the inside... how could I let myself get so attached yet it was so easy for her to toss me (or at least that's what it feels like) ... but.... I still want her to be as happy as she can be.. even if it's not with me because she deserves the world... and I was prepared to give her that... she is the person I want to build a future with.. but we all know its a 2 way street and it requires 2 people.. 

So as of now... there's delay messages... the seen 7 hours ago... probably going to be more and might get ghosted etc etc... 

Am I just too committed? 

Or is there genuinely something wrong with me? 

I have my thoughts about some of the answers as I do reflect a lot but I just want that assurance...

I am willing to accept the pain to hear the answer in person rather than playing games all the time..

I would like to hear your opinion of me..

TL;DR;
2 years of friendship, frequent hangouts, just 2 of us, no label, no intentions, asked her 'Have you ever thought about us being together?' Immediate response 'I think we are better as friends'. Her mom knows about me and we say Hi to eachother through her

All I want is for her to be happy, even if it's not with me..I have that much respect for her

Did I (28M) commit too much? 

Is she (34F) afraid? (I know her last relationship was when she was 20 and from then she focused on her studies and career)

Or is there genuinely something wrong with me?

When I unpacked it, I saw immediately that there was water residue in the water hose. Furthermore, the machine had quite a few scratches on the surface (see pictures). I called the customer support from the online shop and they said it was highly unusual since they don‚Äôt open the packages and send them out as they receive it from the manufacturer. However, they offered me to replace the machine or 100‚Ç¨ if I decide to keep it (2 years guarantee). They also told me I can test over the weekend and then decide want I want to do. The machine seems to work perfectly. I can draw amazing shots of espresso from it. However, I inspected the group head further and noticed that the ‚Äúfilter‚Äù were the water gets pushed into the basket is quite scratched. In fact it‚Äôs so badly scratched that I wonder if it‚Äôs indented to look like this? Another thing that worries me is that one tiny hole is not punctured properly and therefore might influence extraction? 

I paid 493‚Ç¨ for the machine which is a pretty good price (at least in Germany). With the discount it would be 399‚Ç¨. However, I‚Äôm not sure not happened to the machine since it is obviously not in a perfect state. Should I keep it or send it back and get a new one?
