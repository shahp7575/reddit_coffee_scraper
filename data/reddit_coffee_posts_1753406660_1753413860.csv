If you're like me and can't resist the sweet-tart goodness of fresh blueberries, you're in for a treat. I've put together a collection of amazing blueberry cake recipes that'll make your mouth water. Here are some highlights from my favorite blueberry desserts:

#1. Blueberry Upside Down Cake
This showstopper flips the script on traditional pineapple upside-down cake. When you invert it, you'll reveal a gorgeous layer of caramelized blueberries that have created their own purple-hued sauce. The tender vanilla cake underneath soaks up all that fruity goodness.

#2. Blueberry Buckle
Don't let the name fool you – this isn't about seat belts! A buckle is basically a coffee cake loaded with berries and topped with a crispy streusel that ""buckles"" as it bakes. It's perfect with your morning coffee or as an afternoon snack.

#3. Lemon Blueberry Zucchini Cake
This might sound unusual, but trust me – the zucchini makes this cake incredibly moist without any vegetable taste. The bright lemon zest perfectly complements the sweet blueberries, and you get bonus points for sneaking in some veggies!

#4. Blueberry Brunch Cake
When you need something special for a late morning gathering, this is your go-to recipe. It's lighter than traditional cake but more indulgent than muffins, with a delicate crumb and bursts of berry in every bite.

#5. Lemon-Blueberry Bundt Cake
This elegant cake is a real crowd-pleaser. The bundt pan creates beautiful ridges that catch the lemon glaze perfectly, while fresh blueberries dot the cake like little jewels throughout.

#6. Blueberry Dump Cake
Don't let the casual name fool you – this is one of the easiest and most delicious desserts you'll ever make. Just dump the ingredients in a pan, and magic happens in the oven. It's practically foolproof!

#7. Blueberry Breakfast Cake
Who says you can't have cake for breakfast? This recipe walks the line between coffee cake and breakfast bread, with a protein boost from Greek yogurt and enough blueberries to justify it as your morning meal.

#8. Blueberry Tea Cake
Light, delicate, and perfect for afternoon tea, this cake has a tender crumb and isn't too sweet. The blueberries add just the right amount of fruit flavor without overwhelming the subtle vanilla notes.

These are just half of the amazing blueberry cake recipes I've collected!

## Key Features Analysis

The Eiffel Tower Vase market presents a wide range of materials, sizes, and finishes. Understanding the key features will help you narrow down your choices and find the perfect vase to complement your decor.

**Material:** The Eiffel Tower Vases are available in various materials, including metal (aluminum, iron, and stainless steel), glass, acrylic, and even ceramic.

The choice of material significantly impacts the vase's durability, weight, and overall aesthetic. Metal vases, especially those made of stainless steel or iron, offer excellent durability and a modern, industrial look. Glass vases provide a classic and elegant feel, allowing the flowers to be the center of attention. Acrylic vases are a lightweight and affordable option, while ceramic vases offer a unique, handcrafted touch.

**Height and Size:** Eiffel Tower Vases come in a wide range of heights, from petite tabletop decorations to impressive floor-standing centerpieces.

The ideal height depends on the intended use and the size of the space where the vase will be displayed. Smaller vases (under 12 inches) are perfect for accent tables and shelves, while larger vases (over 24 inches) make a bold statement on dining tables or in entryways. Consider the scale of your flowers and the overall visual impact you want to achieve when selecting the height.

**Finish and Color:** The finish and color of the vase play a crucial role in its overall aesthetic appeal.

Common finishes include polished metal, matte black, antique bronze, and painted colors. Polished metal finishes offer a sleek and modern look, while matte black and antique bronze finishes provide a more rustic and vintage feel. Painted colors allow for greater customization and can be used to match existing decor. Consider the color palette of your space and the style of your flowers when choosing a finish and color.

**Base Stability:** A stable base is crucial for preventing the vase from tipping over, especially when filled with water and flowers.

Look for vases with a wide and sturdy base, preferably made of a weighted material. The base should be designed to evenly distribute the weight of the vase and its contents, minimizing the risk of accidents. Check customer reviews to see if other users have reported any issues with stability.

**Construction Quality:** The quality of construction directly impacts the vase's durability and longevity.

Examine the joints and seams of the vase to ensure they are securely welded or glued together. Look for smooth edges and a consistent finish, free from imperfections. Higher-quality vases are typically made with thicker materials and more meticulous craftsmanship.

Key features of the best Eiffel Tower Vases include:
* Durable Material
* Appropriate Height and Size
* Complementary Finish and Color
* Stable Base
* High-Quality Construction

I’m not picky about who you are or where you’re from. If you’re kind, can handle random bursts of energy followed by chill silences, and enjoy sending voice notes, cursed images, or ranting about weirdly specific things, we’ll probably get along.

If you need a text friend to hype you up, keep you company during boring days, or just share the tiny wins and weird thoughts with, message me. I’m not perfect at texting 24/7 but I try to be consistent and genuinely enjoy talking to people.

1m8odjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m8odjm/not_getting_any_interest_from_anyone_online_or/,"Not getting any interest from anyone online or offline, need help.","I'm 31F but have never had a boyfriend - though not by choice. I studied an STEM major and have been surrounded by guys in a male dominated field both as a student and at work for over a decade and in all that time only 1 guy showed any interest in me but he was a coworker 9 years older than me and was training me when I was new to my job. (For context, though I was really interested, we had a lot of chemistry, but I was young mid 20s and inexperienced, and afraid of dating at work so I panicked and declined at first: but he rejected me horribly when I tried to approach him a few months later, when he was secretly seeing someone else but giving me mixed signals at the same time. Ever since then he's been unpleasant, deflecting blame on me as to why things didn't work out and he called me manipulative and delusional, acted hot and cold and even pryed on my personal life like asking me if I have a big bed. He recently got engaged but the whole experience left me hurt and questioning whether he was just playing with me or was actually interested).
But in the years before and since, no guy has ever expressed any interest in me. I've asked a different guy out IRL (after someone else saw the chemistry between us) but he brutally rejected me publicly with no second thought. I get a few matches in dating apps most of which are both of poor quality (I'm allowed to have some standards) and quantity (get close to zero matches even if I sent the likes first and pay for the apps). I've been on something like 6 first dates over the last 4 years from the apps but none got past the first coffee - got ghosted even though they seemed like reasonable dates. I went to speed dating and not a single one matched afterwards. I may be average looking but beauty is in the eye of the holder.
I just can't figure out why I'm getting such a high degree of repeated rejection:  I put a lot of care, kindness and loyalty into all my relationships and friendships, I've put effort into dating and effort presenting myself but somehow I can barely get a first date let alone a second one. And IRL guys don't even consider to approach me or ask me out even if there's ""chemistry"".
I'm a bit reserved/serious by nature but can hold a conversation and have humour too so surely someone likes that too? I'm also a minority and vegetarian (though open to date a meat eater). Are there other women in this boat too, with little to none dating experience because no men show interest in them? Is it compatibility, luck or is it something else?

1m8od7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1m8od7s/vicious_cycles_and_peanut_butter_sandwiches/,Vicious Cycles and Peanut Butter Sandwiches,"*(****Author's note****: This story was originally published in* [*Illustrated Worlds Magazine*](https://www.illustratedworldsmagazine.com/#/)*, issue 9)*

The devil’s hour had passed, and another day had come. Time flowed whether you were conscious of it or not. Aria rolled over in bed. She was always conscious of it. She knew exactly how much time she had wasted without being able to change anything. *A waste of time and space*, as Mom would have said. The sunlight peaking around the blackout curtains seemed to scream that she was wasting another beautiful day.

A glance around the room was an assault on her eyeballs. Dirty dishes sat between stacks of textbooks or peeked out from under piles of dirty clothes. Three moldy butter knives pinned a college acceptance letter to the wall. She sniffed herself and grimaced; she had been wearing the same pajamas forever. Ignoring the crusty smear of peanut butter on the screen, Aria checked the time on her phone. “2-1-5, 2-1-5, 2-1-5,” she whispered. Her index finger tapped the mattress as she said each number.

Someone knocked on her door. “Aria, there’s someone here to see you,” Millie said.

Aria sat up and groaned. Her whole body hurt, even her hair and teeth. “Go away.”

“Aria—”

“Just. Go. Away.” Aria banged her fist against the wall.

A man’s voice said, “Aria, my name is Doctor Hugh Redmond. Your sister asked me to speak with you. We can talk through the door if that's easier for you.”

“No, thanks. I’ve had enough doctors. You can't help me.”

“Aria, you promised. Don't be a waste of time and space,” Millie said.

Aria twitched.

“I think you’d be surprised. I’ve helped many people with similar problems,” the doctor said.

Aria snorted. “And what exactly are my problems?”

“Your sister tells me you always had a strict routine and any changes upset you. Eleven months ago, you stopped leaving your bedroom.”

“So, what kind of crazy does that make me?”

“I don’t use that word and I can't diagnose you until we've talked more.”

“You’re thinking agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive. How many times have I heard that?” Aria asked.

“Then talk to me. The more I learn about you, the better help I can offer.”

“Fine. As busy as my schedule is, I think I can squeeze you in. Send my sister downstairs and we'll talk.”

“I'm leaving,” Millie said. The stairs creaked.

“Do you have a chair? This could take a while,” Aria chuckled.

“Yes, Millie gave me one. Thank you for your consideration.”

The doctor sat on the straight-backed wooden chair. It groaned. He glanced around the small, bright, and tidy Cape Cod. Files from the previous doctors had noted that Aria’s older sister, Millie, had inherited the house when their mother died two years ago.

“How considerate of me to make you talk to a door while sitting in the least comfortable chair in the house. I don't think Millie expects you to stay long.” She laid back and put her hands under her head. “Where should I start?”

“Wherever you like, Aria.” The doctor reached into his satchel for a notepad, pen, and file. The file stated Aria was eighteen years old and highly intelligent. Clipped inside was a picture of a young woman with brown hair. The dark circles under her brown eyes and thousand-yard stare made her appear much older. He recognized that look, but nothing in her files accounted for it. He wrote the date, time, and Aria's initials on his notepad.

“Let's make it interesting. Why don't I tell you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but?” Aria asked.

“You didn't tell the other doctors the truth?”

“No fucking way! They already thought I was your garden-variety nutcase—all she needs are some blue and yellow pills and weekly chats with a doctor. But maybe I'm straight-jacket-and-padded-room-in-an-institution crazy.”

“People don't get institutionalized unless they're a danger to themselves or others.”

Aria said nothing.

“Aria? Do you want to hurt yourself or someone else?”

“Not at the moment. Lemme tell my story, doc.”

He cringed inside at the diminutive. “Ok, Aria. Please do.”

“How much time have you got?”

“Two hours.”

Aria whistled. “Wow. Who's footing this insane bill? Excuse my language.”

“I'm not at liberty to say.”

“So, my rich brother-in-law.” Aria laughed. “Guess I better give him his money's worth. Once upon a time, I had a normal life. I had a 4.0 GPA. I was taking advanced classes at the community college. I was planning to go to S\_\_\_\_\_ University on a full scholarship and major in psychology. Then, everything stopped changing.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“Ever heard of a time loop, doc?”

“A time loop?”

“It's like in one of those movies where someone lives the same day over and over. One Friday, I woke up to sunshine after weeks of rain. It was so lovely, I wished it would never end. I got my wish, and every minute since has been a living hell.”

Doctor Redmond's pen scratched across his notepad. “You’re saying you had plans for your life and then it seemed like everything stopped. You felt like you were reliving the same day.”

“There you go being all doctory, doc. I never said I *felt* like I was stuck in a time loop. I *was* stuck in a time loop. I kept reliving that same goddamned sunny Friday.”

*Possible time disorientation*, he thought. “What day is today, Aria?”

“It's Sunday the first. That Friday and all its misery finally ended. Then the recovery began, though I wouldn't say I've recovered.”

“Recovery?”

“You think you can keep reliving the same day, and then go back to normal after? I don't know what you'd call it. PTLD? Post-time loop disorder?” Aria giggled. “You lose your mind in the repetitive, unchangingness of it all. Then when everything finally changes, you lose your mind again.”

“As in you always knew what to expect and now you never know what to expect?”

“Now you're getting it, doc.”

Doctor Redmond's pen scratched again. “Is that what prompted your strict schedules?”

“I've always had strict schedules. After the loop, I stopped leaving my room because of the unpredictability. I'd forgotten how to live a normal life; the constant changes gave me panic attacks. I became a permanent, crazy fixture in my poor sister's house, with no end in sight.”

He wrote *extreme anxiety when routines are altered*. “What is a normal life to you?”

“Uh uh. No getting off topic.”

“Ok, Aria. I'll try to stay on topic.” The doctor checked his watch. One and a half hours left. “How is your relationship with your sister?”

“Verboten!” Aria sat up and poked her finger into the sandwich Millie had left her. Kettle chips spilled onto the bed. “It’s always peanut butter and jelly,” she muttered. She checked her phone. One and a half hours to go.

“Aria—”

“I'm sure you know the stages of grief, but do you know the stages of time looping?” she asked.

He jotted down *refusal to discuss relationship with sister*. “No, I don’t. What are they?”

“It starts with denial. I thought it was a nightmare I could wake myself up from. I stayed up all night. I jumped in the ice-cold lake. I pinched and punched myself. But midnight would come and I'd wake up in bed on the same Friday with no one else the wiser.

“What do you think the next stage is, doc?”

“Anger?”

“Nope. Begging. I begged God, Satan, anyone to make the loop end. I offered up my life, my soul, and my firstborn. Next stage. Any ideas?” Aria asked.

“Depression?”

“Try harder, doc. Anarchy is number three! I realized I could do anything I wanted and no one could stop me. Shoplifting. Stealing cars. Do you know what bad guys do before they rob a bank?”

“What do they do?”

“They stake the place out. I had nothing but time and the schedule never changed. I robbed stores and banks. I even robbed the mayor.” Aria's voice changed to a stage whisper. “You'd never believe the S&M dungeon he has in a hidden room. He seems like such a nice guy.”

Doctor Redmond wrote *unable to separate fantasy from reality and/or enjoys telling stories to shock*.

“Then there was arson. Molotovs work well enough, but bombs are better. Bit of a steep learning curve, though.”

“You know how to make bombs?” None of the files had mentioned violent fantasies. To be safe, the doctor noted it and wrote *have sister search Aria’s room for weapons/explosives*.

Aria nibbled at the sandwich and frowned. “Just the way Mom always made them,” she whispered. Her eyes teared up. She rubbed her face.

“Aria?”

“Depression was lucky number four! That was less fun than anarchy. I couldn't get out of bed. Everything hurt. I cried at random times. After a while, I didn't see the point in living a life that never changed, so I killed myself.”

The chair complained as the doctor sat up straighter. “You tried to kill yourself? When?”

“You're not listening. I *did* kill myself. Many times. I started painless and bloodless. Pills. A car running in a closed garage. Same thing every time. Everything went black and then I'd wake up perfectly fine on Friday morning.”

Doctor Redmond wrote *depression, suicidal ideation?* “And what about now? Do you still want to kill yourself?”

“I don't want to die, I'm not thinking about it, and I have no plans to hurt or kill myself, so you can cross out suicidal ideation.” She crunched on a chip.

Doctor Redmond blinked. Her answer would have ticked off all the boxes on a standard suicide severity questionnaire. *Studied psychology,* he wrote. The chair squeaked as he settled back. “How many times did you kill yourself?”

“Hoo boy, that's tough. I lost count after a while. When the easy stuff didn't work, I switched to more painful, bloody methods: shooting, jumping off a bridge, hanging, stabbing, and electrocution, to name a few. I even climbed into the lion cage at the zoo. That was a doozy.” Aria put the last chip between her molars and chomped down. “Those teeth cracking through my bones is not something I will ever forget. Thankfully, I bled out fast.” She shrugged. “Nothing worked.”

“Aria, I have to ask again, are you sure—”

“Know what the last stage is?”

“Aria—”

With an edge to her voice, Aria said, “The last stage, doc, or we're done.”

The doctor swallowed a sigh. If he pushed too hard, he would lose her. “What's the last stage?” He squinted at his notes in the dimming light. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

“I thought since I was the only one who knew about the loop, I was the only real person. So, I killed the others.” Aria laughed. “What would you call that stage?”

Doctor Redmond tensed. He added up the signs: withdrawal, losing touch with reality, paranoia, and violent fantasies. Textbook example of psychosis.

“You think I'm psychotic, don't cha?”

Rain pounded the roof. The doctor's hand twitched.

“Remember, doc, it's only a story. Time loops aren't real, right?”

He underlined *studied psychology* and *telling stories to shock*. “Who wasn't real?”

“Everyone. Millie, friends, strangers, the mayor. I killed them all. Even you.”

The doctor's mouth went dry. “Me?”

“I was so desperate to end the loop, I thought a shrink might help. You and I talked about vicious cycles, grief, and anger. But I didn’t like your advice, so I killed you.”

It was quiet in the hall for a long time.

“Did I scare you away, doc?”

“I'm here, Aria. I'm just processing.” He wrote *needs further examination and probable in-patient treatment.*

“I can hear the gears in your head grinding through that shit from here. How about we... forgive and move forward?”

Doctor Redmond wiped his damp palms on his slacks. Aria must have looked up his latest book, *Forgiveness and Moving Forward*. “How long were you in the time loop?”

“Nice recovery, doc! Hard to say. I couldn't write it down because it would disappear after the nightly reset. Sisyphean task! Somewhere around ninety years.”

“That’s a long time.”

“What are you, forty-four? That's old. And if you're old, I'm ancient!” Aria cackled.

He caught himself frowning. She had guessed his age without even seeing him. “When did the loop start?”

“November first last year. El Dia de los Muertos.”

The doctor sucked in a breath.

Aria smiled. “Does that mean something to you?”

Clearing his throat, the doctor said, “We're here to talk about you, Aria.” His trembling fingers fumbled with the cap of his water bottle.

“Not a good day for you for some reason. Let's see... you found out your wife was cheating? Your dog died? Your kid died?” She shoved her finger into the sandwich until red jelly seeped out. “Or you started having nightmares where someone shot you in the head and *you* died.”

The bottle thumped to the floor. Thunder boomed.

“Bingo!” Aria clapped her hands. “You laid on the floor feeling yourself dying, wishing it would end but also wishing it wouldn't. I know what that's like.”

“How... ”

“I told you, I killed you. You forgot after the reset, but maybe the trauma still lingered. Latent PTSD.” She steepled her fingers under her chin. “Iiiiinteresting.”

Doctor Redmond gripped the chair with both hands to keep from joining his bottle. “That can't... ” He gasped as if all the oxygen in the house had been used up.

“You don't sound too good, doc. Breathe slowly. Four-seven-eight. Four-seven-eight. Four-seven-eight.” Aria tapped on the wall to punctuate each number.

Doctor Redmond's face flushed. *He* was the doctor. He slowed his breaths and relaxed his tensed muscles. “I'm fine.”

Aria touched her phone screen. The soft glow illuminated the dark room. “Wanna know what happened next?”

“Please tell me,” the doctor said. His voice was steady again. He nodded to himself. He was a professional.

“The loop ended.” Aria clicked on a light. She watched a moth struggle to escape from a web behind the lampshade as the spider closed in. “I don't know why, though. To get out in the movies, you have to become a better person, learn your lesson, forgive and forget, blah blah blah. That didn't happen here. I need to know what ended the last loop so I can escape from the next one.”

“Do you think there will be another loop?”

“Who's to say?” Aria checked the time again.

*Was there any truth hidden in these stories?* the doctor thought as he rubbed his face. He would hand this case over to someone else. There wasn't anything in heaven or hell that would make him come back here.

At the same time, they both said, “Our time is up.”

“Thank you for talking with me, Aria. Unfortunately, I don't think I'm the best fit for you. I'll refer your case to another doctor.”

There was silence from the bedroom. “Aria? Are you ok?”

Bedsprings squeaked. The floor creaked. Thunder rattled the house.

Aria leaned her shoulder against the door. “I haven't been ok for decades. And you won't hand off my case. You'll be back.”

“No, Aria.” He stood and dropped his things into his satchel, closing it with a flick of his wrist. “I won't be back.”

The bedroom door cracked open. A small plate rolled out on its edge. Doctor Redmond jumped as it hit his foot, tipped over, and clattered to the ground. He knelt to pick it up.

Thunder exploded, shaking the windows.

A picture of a blue sugar skull grinned up at him. Blobs of red jelly dripped down its forehead.

Aria licked her fingertips. “You know, doc, I wouldn't be so sure.”

\#

Aria poked the sandwich her sister had left. “Fucking peanut butter and jelly.” She checked the time. “9-5-5-9, 9-5-5-9, 9-5-5-9,” she said, tapping her finger on the plate in time to the numbers.

The stairs groaned. “Showtime.”

Someone knocked on the door. “Aria, there’s someone here to see you,” Millie said.

“And who might that be, sister dear?” Aria said with saccharine sweetness. She heard Millie suck in a breath.

“Aria, my name is Doctor Hugh Redmond. Your sister asked me to speak with you. We can talk through the door if that's easier for you.”

“Sure. Send my sister away and we'll talk.”

“I'm leaving,” Millie said. The stairs creaked.

“Ok, doc, why don't you pull up that uncomfortable, not very sturdy chair Millie left you?”

Doctor Redmond turned. There was a straight-backed wooden chair behind him. He suppressed a sigh. It would be an uncomfortable two-hour session. The chair complained as he sat. He pulled a notepad and pen from his satchel and jotted down *Patient: A.Z., Session: one, Date: November 1st*. He reached for her file.

“I think I'd like to talk face to face.” Aria opened the door. She leaned against the door jamb with her hands clasped behind her and stared at the doctor. He was middle-aged and average-looking. Sandy hair and eyes. Business casual dress. He looked like he sounded.

“Thank you, Aria. I hope—”

“We can make some progress today,” Aria finished.

He cleared his throat and glanced at his notepad. “Well, yes. We should get you a chair, too.”

“No thanks. I’m good.”

“Ok, Aria. What would you like to talk about?”

“Well, today I’m going to try something different.”

“Can you tell me what you mean by that?” the doctor asked.

“TLDR, I’m stuck in a time loop, again, and I want out. Wanna know how many times we’ve had this conversation?”

“Time loop? Can you—”

“Same day over and over but only I remember it. Nine thousand five hundred and fifty-nine times—that’s over nine thousand goddamned peanut butter sandwiches and it’s-nice-to-meet-you’s. I have to keep repeating the day number so I don't lose track, though once you get to five digits, it doesn't seem worth it anymore.”

“You feel like you’re stuck in the same day?”

Aria frowned. “No matter what I do, you never change.”

“We’ve never met before, Aria.”

“We have and I’ll prove it, doc.” Aria raised her right arm, pointing a .22 caliber pistol toward Doctor Redmond. “Does this seem familiar?”

The doctor paled and stood with his hands raised. “Aria, you don’t need that. We can just talk.”

“Oh, but I do need it. It’s time to shake things up.” Aria yelled down the stairs without taking her eyes off him, “Hey, Millie! Phil! Would you mind coming up here? The good doctor needs to speak with you!”

The doctor opened his mouth, but Aria shook her head.

They heard Millie and Phil moving towards the stairs.

“Waste of time,” Phil said.

Millie whispered, “Keep your voice down!”

Phil harrumphed. “Don't know why she demanded *him*. Certainly costs enough.” The stairs creaked. Stepping onto the landing, they looked from the doctor to Aria and froze.

Phil’s mouth closed and opened convulsively like a fish out of water.

Millie said, “Aria! What—”

“Be quiet, sister dear. Your role isn't a speaking one.”

Phil glanced at the stairs.

The gun barrel moved toward him. “Stay put, dear brother.”

Phil yelped and backed against the wall.

“So, doc. This is what I need from you.” Aria pulled her left hand from behind her. In it, was another pistol. She crouched and slid it across the polished wood floor.

Doctor Redmond flinched when the gun hit his foot. “What are you doing, Aria? This isn’t going to help.”

The hall darkened. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

“You think you’re a smart guy, but you don’t know anything. I’ve got ninety years on you.” Aria clicked on the hall light with her free hand. Her smile didn't reach her eyes. “Pick up the gun.”

“Aria, you don't need to—”

“Pick up the gun or I *will* shoot.” Aria's brown eyes stared into Millie's green ones. “Remember when we used to decide who was it?”

Rain pounded the roof. The gun barrel moved between the three of them. “Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief. Doctor...” The gun pointed at Doctor Redmond. “Miss Perfect... ” It moved to Millie. “Asshole... ” It swung to Phil.

“Ok!” the doctor picked up the gun but kept it pointed at the ground.

Aria chuckled. “Point it at me, silly. They don’t matter.”

“Everyone matters, Aria.” His voice quivered.

“Right now, only you and I matter.” Aria pulled her phone from her pocket and checked the time.

“The neighbors will hear the gunshots and call the police,” the doctor said.

Thunder boomed.

Phil screamed and slid to the floor. Blood blossomed through his khaki pants.

Millie shrieked. She knelt and pressed her hands over the hole in his thigh. “Call 911!”

“Sorry, that'll have to wait,” Aria said.

“Aria!” Millie cried. “Oh my god… ”

“Your move, doc.”

Doctor Redmond stepped back. The backs of his knees bumped the chair. His breath hitched.

Aria smiled wide. “That chair's not as sturdy as it seems.”

The doctor’s body twitched.

“No matter how many times you've thrown it at me, it doesn't end this.”

“I wasn't going to—”

“You were. 5-7, 5-7, 5-7.” Aria tapped the door jam with her phone as she said each number. “You've thrown that chair fifty-seven times. If you even look like you're thinking about it, I'll shoot Millie.”

Millie gasped and turned toward Aria.

“Is that surprising, sister dear? You think I'm a waste of time and space. Today’s session was my last chance before you tossed me in the looney bin.”

Millie opened her mouth.

“Don't deny it. I'm tired of trying to measure up to the golden child. And I'm really fucking tired of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Mom always made them because they were *your* favorite.” Aria sneered. “I thought forgiving you and Mom might end the loop. I even went to the doc for help, but I couldn’t do it.” She pointed the gun at Millie. “You treated me like garbage and you think it's *my fault* my head is so messed up! You're just like Mom.”

The doctor took deep breaths. His hands steadied. *Focus her attention on me and keep her calm,* he thought. “Ok, Aria. Tell me what you want. And please, no more shooting.”

“That's simple, doc. I want you to shoot me.”

“No. I can't do that, Aria.” The doctor put the safety on his gun.

“Sure you can. Take the safety off and pull the trigger. But—and this is important—you have to kill me or I'll kill you. I've done it before, remember?”

Doctor Redmond trembled.

Aria tapped her temple with her index finger. “7-0, 7-0, 7-0. If something traumatic happens in the loop, it sticks around in your unconscious after the reset. Tomorrow, Millie and Phil will be scared of me though they won't know why.” Her voice rose. “*You* have to end the loop!”

He shook his head. “I won't do that.”

“Kill me or you all die!”

Phil whimpered. His eyes rolled back in his head.

“No. You won't kill anyone,” Doctor Redmond said.

Aria arched an eyebrow. “Why on Earth do you think that?”

“Because you want help. I can help you without anyone else getting hurt.”

Aria checked her phone. “They. Don't. Matter.”

Thunder rattled the house.

The doctor and Millie flinched. Blood dripped from a hole in Phil's forehead.

Millie's mouth fell open but no sound came out.

“Shoot me, doc. Or Millie is next.”

The doctor's knees gave out. He fell back onto the chair. A chair leg snapped in half, dumping him onto the floor. “This... This isn't the way.”

“I kept asking you for help. On day thirty-two thousand nine hundred, you asked me if it was fair to put all the blame on Millie and Mom. When I tried to shoot you, you shot me instead. I woke up, it was November second, and everything had reset.

“Shoot me and we'll all wake up tomorrow, the real tomorrow, and only I'll be the wiser.” Aria shrugged. “For the most part.”

“I wouldn’t have killed you... ” Doctor Redmond’s lips quivered. “No! Time loops aren't real and I didn't shoot you.”

“They are and you did. Tell the police it was self-defense. It won't matter after the devil’s hour.” Aria closed her eyes for a moment. The dark circles under her eyes looked like bruises. “I don’t age and I can’t die. If you don’t do this, it will *never* end. Never.”

“Aria—”

Aria pointed the gun at Millie. “Mom loved her most no matter what I did. You can't blame me for that.” She glanced at the time.

“No!”

Lightening flashed. Thunder cracked. Millie tipped backward onto Phil's outstretched legs. Her fingers spasmed. A crimson stain spread across the front of her pristine white blouse.

The doctor dropped the pistol. His head and shoulders sagged.

Aria knelt in front of him. “You won't shoot me, even if I say you're next. You're a stubborn one aren't you, doc?”

He said nothing.

“I know your family.”

The doctor's head snapped up. “What?”

“Liz always gets a lunchtime coffee at the cafe. Your son, Jacob, has curly red hair. Gets it from his mother.”

“How do you—”

“Your house is nice. Two-story brick colonial. White picket fence. Roses and tulips. Such a damned cliche.”

What little blood was left in Doctor Redmond’s face drained away. “Don't, Aria!”

“Kill me or I truss you up, toss you in the trunk of my car, and make you watch as I kill your adorable family. Because they don't matter either.” One corner of her mouth lifted. “I think I skipped anarchy this time and went straight to psychopath.”

She set her phone on the floor and pushed it.

It slid into Millie's hand. Her fingers lifted. A gurgling sound escaped her mouth as she dragged a bloody finger across the screen.

“Shoot me and call the cops.” Aria shrugged. “Phil's done for but maybe they can save Millie.”

Doctor Redmond stared into Aria's empty eyes. She had talked about killing her family and his as if she was discussing the weather. *She can't be reasoned with,* he thought. He had to keep his family safe. He turned to look at her phone.

Aria's eyes opened wide. She followed his gaze.

He lunged at Aria.

Aria whooped as he knocked her backward.

He grabbed her gun.

“Finally!” she yelled.

Thunder exploded, shaking the windows.

The gun went off once. Twice. Three times.

\#

Aria opened her eyes. Her phone sat on the bedside table. She ran her finger over the cold glass screen without looking at it, feeling a crusty smear. “Peanut butter or blood?”

She curled up, clutching her pillow to her chest. The past was set in stone. Her mother was dead, but her attitudes lived on in her children. A century of extra time hadn't freed Aria from old patterns of behavior. Those were set in stone, too.

She picked up her phone. The date and time appeared.

The phone crashed against the wall and knocked down a framed photo. Glass shards scattered across the floor.

Aria knelt in the sharp fragments, ignoring the pain; it would be gone tomorrow. She pulled the photo from the frame. Younger versions of Mom, Millie, and her stood together, smiling in the sun. Aria tore the picture in two, leaving herself on one side and Millie and Mom on the other. Tomorrow, the photo would be unchanged. She would be unchanged.

The devil’s hour had passed, and another day had come. Time flowed whether you were conscious of it or not. Aria rolled over in bed. She was always conscious of it. She knew exactly how much time she had wasted without being able to change anything. *A waste of time and space*, as Mom would have said. The sunlight peaking around the blackout curtains seemed to scream that she was wasting another beautiful day.

A glance around the room was an assault on her eyeballs. Dirty dishes sat between stacks of textbooks or peeked out from under piles of dirty clothes. Three moldy butter knives pinned a college acceptance letter to the wall. She sniffed herself and grimaced; she had been wearing the same pajamas forever. Ignoring the crusty smear of peanut butter on the screen, Aria checked the time on her phone. “2-1-5, 2-1-5, 2-1-5,” she whispered. Her index finger tapped the mattress as she said each number.

Someone knocked on her door. “Aria, there’s someone here to see you,” Millie said.

Aria sat up and groaned. Her whole body hurt, even her hair and teeth. “Go away.”

“Aria—”

“Just. Go. Away.” Aria banged her fist against the wall.

A man’s voice said, “Aria, my name is Doctor Hugh Redmond. Your sister asked me to speak with you. We can talk through the door if that's easier for you.”

“No, thanks. I’ve had enough doctors. You can't help me.”

“Aria, you promised. Don't be a waste of time and space,” Millie said.

Aria twitched.

“I think you’d be surprised. I’ve helped many people with similar problems,” the doctor said.

Aria snorted. “And what exactly are my problems?”

“Your sister tells me you always had a strict routine and any changes upset you. Eleven months ago, you stopped leaving your bedroom.”

“So, what kind of crazy does that make me?”

“I don’t use that word and I can't diagnose you until we've talked more.”

“You’re thinking agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive. How many times have I heard that?” Aria asked.

“Then talk to me. The more I learn about you, the better help I can offer.”

“Fine. As busy as my schedule is, I think I can squeeze you in. Send my sister downstairs and we'll talk.”

“I'm leaving,” Millie said. The stairs creaked.

“Do you have a chair? This could take a while,” Aria chuckled.

“Yes, Millie gave me one. Thank you for your consideration.”

The doctor sat on the straight-backed wooden chair. It groaned. He glanced around the small, bright, and tidy Cape Cod. Files from the previous doctors had noted that Aria’s older sister, Millie, had inherited the house when their mother died two years ago.

“How considerate of me to make you talk to a door while sitting in the least comfortable chair in the house. I don't think Millie expects you to stay long.” She laid back and put her hands under her head. “Where should I start?”

“Wherever you like, Aria.” The doctor reached into his satchel for a notepad, pen, and file. The file stated Aria was eighteen years old and highly intelligent. Clipped inside was a picture of a young woman with brown hair. The dark circles under her brown eyes and thousand-yard stare made her appear much older. He recognized that look, but nothing in her files accounted for it. He wrote the date, time, and Aria's initials on his notepad.

“Let's make it interesting. Why don't I tell you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but?” Aria asked.

“You didn't tell the other doctors the truth?”

“No fucking way! They already thought I was your garden-variety nutcase—all she needs are some blue and yellow pills and weekly chats with a doctor. But maybe I'm straight-jacket-and-padded-room-in-an-institution crazy.”

“People don't get institutionalized unless they're a danger to themselves or others.”

Aria said nothing.

“Aria? Do you want to hurt yourself or someone else?”

“Not at the moment. Lemme tell my story, doc.”

He cringed inside at the diminutive. “Ok, Aria. Please do.”

“How much time have you got?”

“Two hours.”

Aria whistled. “Wow. Who's footing this insane bill? Excuse my language.”

“I'm not at liberty to say.”

“So, my rich brother-in-law.” Aria laughed. “Guess I better give him his money's worth. Once upon a time, I had a normal life. I had a 4.0 GPA. I was taking advanced classes at the community college. I was planning to go to S\_\_\_\_\_ University on a full scholarship and major in psychology. Then, everything stopped changing.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“Ever heard of a time loop, doc?”

“A time loop?”

“It's like in one of those movies where someone lives the same day over and over. One Friday, I woke up to sunshine after weeks of rain. It was so lovely, I wished it would never end. I got my wish, and every minute since has been a living hell.”

Doctor Redmond's pen scratched across his notepad. “You’re saying you had plans for your life and then it seemed like everything stopped. You felt like you were reliving the same day.”

“There you go being all doctory, doc. I never said I *felt* like I was stuck in a time loop. I *was* stuck in a time loop. I kept reliving that same goddamned sunny Friday.”

*Possible time disorientation*, he thought. “What day is today, Aria?”

“It's Sunday the first. That Friday and all its misery finally ended. Then the recovery began, though I wouldn't say I've recovered.”

“Recovery?”

“You think you can keep reliving the same day, and then go back to normal after? I don't know what you'd call it. PTLD? Post-time loop disorder?” Aria giggled. “You lose your mind in the repetitive, unchangingness of it all. Then when everything finally changes, you lose your mind again.”

“As in you always knew what to expect and now you never know what to expect?”

“Now you're getting it, doc.”

Doctor Redmond's pen scratched again. “Is that what prompted your strict schedules?”

“I've always had strict schedules. After the loop, I stopped leaving my room because of the unpredictability. I'd forgotten how to live a normal life; the constant changes gave me panic attacks. I became a permanent, crazy fixture in my poor sister's house, with no end in sight.”

He wrote *extreme anxiety when routines are altered*. “What is a normal life to you?”

“Uh uh. No getting off topic.”

“Ok, Aria. I'll try to stay on topic.” The doctor checked his watch. One and a half hours left. “How is your relationship with your sister?”

“Verboten!” Aria sat up and poked her finger into the sandwich Millie had left her. Kettle chips spilled onto the bed. “It’s always peanut butter and jelly,” she muttered. She checked her phone. One and a half hours to go.

“Aria—”

“I'm sure you know the stages of grief, but do you know the stages of time looping?” she asked.

He jotted down *refusal to discuss relationship with sister*. “No, I don’t. What are they?”

“It starts with denial. I thought it was a nightmare I could wake myself up from. I stayed up all night. I jumped in the ice-cold lake. I pinched and punched myself. But midnight would come and I'd wake up in bed on the same Friday with no one else the wiser.

“What do you think the next stage is, doc?”

“Anger?”

“Nope. Begging. I begged God, Satan, anyone to make the loop end. I offered up my life, my soul, and my firstborn. Next stage. Any ideas?” Aria asked.

“Depression?”

“Try harder, doc. Anarchy is number three! I realized I could do anything I wanted and no one could stop me. Shoplifting. Stealing cars. Do you know what bad guys do before they rob a bank?”

“What do they do?”

“They stake the place out. I had nothing but time and the schedule never changed. I robbed stores and banks. I even robbed the mayor.” Aria's voice changed to a stage whisper. “You'd never believe the S&M dungeon he has in a hidden room. He seems like such a nice guy.”

Doctor Redmond wrote *unable to separate fantasy from reality and/or enjoys telling stories to shock*.

“Then there was arson. Molotovs work well enough, but bombs are better. Bit of a steep learning curve, though.”

“You know how to make bombs?” None of the files had mentioned violent fantasies. To be safe, the doctor noted it and wrote *have sister search Aria’s room for weapons/explosives*.

Aria nibbled at the sandwich and frowned. “Just the way Mom always made them,” she whispered. Her eyes teared up. She rubbed her face.

“Aria?”

“Depression was lucky number four! That was less fun than anarchy. I couldn't get out of bed. Everything hurt. I cried at random times. After a while, I didn't see the point in living a life that never changed, so I killed myself.”

The chair complained as the doctor sat up straighter. “You tried to kill yourself? When?”

“You're not listening. I *did* kill myself. Many times. I started painless and bloodless. Pills. A car running in a closed garage. Same thing every time. Everything went black and then I'd wake up perfectly fine on Friday morning.”

Doctor Redmond wrote *depression, suicidal ideation?* “And what about now? Do you still want to kill yourself?”

“I don't want to die, I'm not thinking about it, and I have no plans to hurt or kill myself, so you can cross out suicidal ideation.” She crunched on a chip.

Doctor Redmond blinked. Her answer would have ticked off all the boxes on a standard suicide severity questionnaire. *Studied psychology,* he wrote. The chair squeaked as he settled back. “How many times did you kill yourself?”

“Hoo boy, that's tough. I lost count after a while. When the easy stuff didn't work, I switched to more painful, bloody methods: shooting, jumping off a bridge, hanging, stabbing, and electrocution, to name a few. I even climbed into the lion cage at the zoo. That was a doozy.” Aria put the last chip between her molars and chomped down. “Those teeth cracking through my bones is not something I will ever forget. Thankfully, I bled out fast.” She shrugged. “Nothing worked.”

“Aria, I have to ask again, are you sure—”

“Know what the last stage is?”

“Aria—”

With an edge to her voice, Aria said, “The last stage, doc, or we're done.”

The doctor swallowed a sigh. If he pushed too hard, he would lose her. “What's the last stage?” He squinted at his notes in the dimming light. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

“I thought since I was the only one who knew about the loop, I was the only real person. So, I killed the others.” Aria laughed. “What would you call that stage?”

Doctor Redmond tensed. He added up the signs: withdrawal, losing touch with reality, paranoia, and violent fantasies. Textbook example of psychosis.

“You think I'm psychotic, don't cha?”

Rain pounded the roof. The doctor's hand twitched.

“Remember, doc, it's only a story. Time loops aren't real, right?”

He underlined *studied psychology* and *telling stories to shock*. “Who wasn't real?”

“Everyone. Millie, friends, strangers, the mayor. I killed them all. Even you.”

The doctor's mouth went dry. “Me?”

“I was so desperate to end the loop, I thought a shrink might help. You and I talked about vicious cycles, grief, and anger. But I didn’t like your advice, so I killed you.”

It was quiet in the hall for a long time.

“Did I scare you away, doc?”

“I'm here, Aria. I'm just processing.” He wrote *needs further examination and probable in-patient treatment.*

“I can hear the gears in your head grinding through that shit from here. How about we... forgive and move forward?”

Doctor Redmond wiped his damp palms on his slacks. Aria must have looked up his latest book, *Forgiveness and Moving Forward*. “How long were you in the time loop?”

“Nice recovery, doc! Hard to say. I couldn't write it down because it would disappear after the nightly reset. Sisyphean task! Somewhere around ninety years.”

“That’s a long time.”

“What are you, forty-four? That's old. And if you're old, I'm ancient!” Aria cackled.

He caught himself frowning. She had guessed his age without even seeing him. “When did the loop start?”

“November first last year. El Dia de los Muertos.”

The doctor sucked in a breath.

Aria smiled. “Does that mean something to you?”

Clearing his throat, the doctor said, “We're here to talk about you, Aria.” His trembling fingers fumbled with the cap of his water bottle.

“Not a good day for you for some reason. Let's see... you found out your wife was cheating? Your dog died? Your kid died?” She shoved her finger into the sandwich until red jelly seeped out. “Or you started having nightmares where someone shot you in the head and *you* died.”

The bottle thumped to the floor. Thunder boomed.

“Bingo!” Aria clapped her hands. “You laid on the floor feeling yourself dying, wishing it would end but also wishing it wouldn't. I know what that's like.”

“How... ”

“I told you, I killed you. You forgot after the reset, but maybe the trauma still lingered. Latent PTSD.” She steepled her fingers under her chin. “Iiiiinteresting.”

Doctor Redmond gripped the chair with both hands to keep from joining his bottle. “That can't... ” He gasped as if all the oxygen in the house had been used up.

“You don't sound too good, doc. Breathe slowly. Four-seven-eight. Four-seven-eight. Four-seven-eight.” Aria tapped on the wall to punctuate each number.

Doctor Redmond's face flushed. *He* was the doctor. He slowed his breaths and relaxed his tensed muscles. “I'm fine.”

Aria touched her phone screen. The soft glow illuminated the dark room. “Wanna know what happened next?”

“Please tell me,” the doctor said. His voice was steady again. He nodded to himself. He was a professional.

“The loop ended.” Aria clicked on a light. She watched a moth struggle to escape from a web behind the lampshade as the spider closed in. “I don't know why, though. To get out in the movies, you have to become a better person, learn your lesson, forgive and forget, blah blah blah. That didn't happen here. I need to know what ended the last loop so I can escape from the next one.”

“Do you think there will be another loop?”

“Who's to say?” Aria checked the time again.

*Was there any truth hidden in these stories?* the doctor thought as he rubbed his face. He would hand this case over to someone else. There wasn't anything in heaven or hell that would make him come back here.

At the same time, they both said, “Our time is up.”

“Thank you for talking with me, Aria. Unfortunately, I don't think I'm the best fit for you. I'll refer your case to another doctor.”

There was silence from the bedroom. “Aria? Are you ok?”

Bedsprings squeaked. The floor creaked. Thunder rattled the house.

Aria leaned her shoulder against the door. “I haven't been ok for decades. And you won't hand off my case. You'll be back.”

“No, Aria.” He stood and dropped his things into his satchel, closing it with a flick of his wrist. “I won't be back.”

The bedroom door cracked open. A small plate rolled out on its edge. Doctor Redmond jumped as it hit his foot, tipped over, and clattered to the ground. He knelt to pick it up.

Thunder exploded, shaking the windows.

A picture of a blue sugar skull grinned up at him. Blobs of red jelly dripped down its forehead.

Aria licked her fingertips. “You know, doc, I wouldn't be so sure.”

\#

Aria poked the sandwich her sister had left. “Fucking peanut butter and jelly.” She checked the time. “9-5-5-9, 9-5-5-9, 9-5-5-9,” she said, tapping her finger on the plate in time to the numbers.

The stairs groaned. “Showtime.”

Someone knocked on the door. “Aria, there’s someone here to see you,” Millie said.

“And who might that be, sister dear?” Aria said with saccharine sweetness. She heard Millie suck in a breath.

“Aria, my name is Doctor Hugh Redmond. Your sister asked me to speak with you. We can talk through the door if that's easier for you.”

“Sure. Send my sister away and we'll talk.”

“I'm leaving,” Millie said. The stairs creaked.

“Ok, doc, why don't you pull up that uncomfortable, not very sturdy chair Millie left you?”

Doctor Redmond turned. There was a straight-backed wooden chair behind him. He suppressed a sigh. It would be an uncomfortable two-hour session. The chair complained as he sat. He pulled a notepad and pen from his satchel and jotted down *Patient: A.Z., Session: one, Date: November 1st*. He reached for her file.

“I think I'd like to talk face to face.” Aria opened the door. She leaned against the door jamb with her hands clasped behind her and stared at the doctor. He was middle-aged and average-looking. Sandy hair and eyes. Business casual dress. He looked like he sounded.

“Thank you, Aria. I hope—”

“We can make some progress today,” Aria finished.

He cleared his throat and glanced at his notepad. “Well, yes. We should get you a chair, too.”

“No thanks. I’m good.”

“Ok, Aria. What would you like to talk about?”

“Well, today I’m going to try something different.”

“Can you tell me what you mean by that?” the doctor asked.

“TLDR, I’m stuck in a time loop, again, and I want out. Wanna know how many times we’ve had this conversation?”

“Time loop? Can you—”

“Same day over and over but only I remember it. Nine thousand five hundred and fifty-nine times—that’s over nine thousand goddamned peanut butter sandwiches and it’s-nice-to-meet-you’s. I have to keep repeating the day number so I don't lose track, though once you get to five digits, it doesn't seem worth it anymore.”

“You feel like you’re stuck in the same day?”

Aria frowned. “No matter what I do, you never change.”

“We’ve never met before, Aria.”

“We have and I’ll prove it, doc.” Aria raised her right arm, pointing a .22 caliber pistol toward Doctor Redmond. “Does this seem familiar?”

The doctor paled and stood with his hands raised. “Aria, you don’t need that. We can just talk.”

“Oh, but I do need it. It’s time to shake things up.” Aria yelled down the stairs without taking her eyes off him, “Hey, Millie! Phil! Would you mind coming up here? The good doctor needs to speak with you!”

The doctor opened his mouth, but Aria shook her head.

They heard Millie and Phil moving towards the stairs.

“Waste of time,” Phil said.

Millie whispered, “Keep your voice down!”

Phil harrumphed. “Don't know why she demanded *him*. Certainly costs enough.” The stairs creaked. Stepping onto the landing, they looked from the doctor to Aria and froze.

Phil’s mouth closed and opened convulsively like a fish out of water.

Millie said, “Aria! What—”

“Be quiet, sister dear. Your role isn't a speaking one.”

Phil glanced at the stairs.

The gun barrel moved toward him. “Stay put, dear brother.”

Phil yelped and backed against the wall.

“So, doc. This is what I need from you.” Aria pulled her left hand from behind her. In it, was another pistol. She crouched and slid it across the polished wood floor.

Doctor Redmond flinched when the gun hit his foot. “What are you doing, Aria? This isn’t going to help.”

The hall darkened. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

“You think you’re a smart guy, but you don’t know anything. I’ve got ninety years on you.” Aria clicked on the hall light with her free hand. Her smile didn't reach her eyes. “Pick up the gun.”

“Aria, you don't need to—”

“Pick up the gun or I *will* shoot.” Aria's brown eyes stared into Millie's green ones. “Remember when we used to decide who was it?”

Rain pounded the roof. The gun barrel moved between the three of them. “Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief. Doctor...” The gun pointed at Doctor Redmond. “Miss Perfect... ” It moved to Millie. “Asshole... ” It swung to Phil.

“Ok!” the doctor picked up the gun but kept it pointed at the ground.

Aria chuckled. “Point it at me, silly. They don’t matter.”

“Everyone matters, Aria.” His voice quivered.

“Right now, only you and I matter.” Aria pulled her phone from her pocket and checked the time.

“The neighbors will hear the gunshots and call the police,” the doctor said.

Thunder boomed.

Phil screamed and slid to the floor. Blood blossomed through his khaki pants.

Millie shrieked. She knelt and pressed her hands over the hole in his thigh. “Call 911!”

“Sorry, that'll have to wait,” Aria said.

“Aria!” Millie cried. “Oh my god… ”

“Your move, doc.”

Doctor Redmond stepped back. The backs of his knees bumped the chair. His breath hitched.

Aria smiled wide. “That chair's not as sturdy as it seems.”

The doctor’s body twitched.

“No matter how many times you've thrown it at me, it doesn't end this.”

“I wasn't going to—”

“You were. 5-7, 5-7, 5-7.” Aria tapped the door jam with her phone as she said each number. “You've thrown that chair fifty-seven times. If you even look like you're thinking about it, I'll shoot Millie.”

Millie gasped and turned toward Aria.

“Is that surprising, sister dear? You think I'm a waste of time and space. Today’s session was my last chance before you tossed me in the looney bin.”

Millie opened her mouth.

“Don't deny it. I'm tired of trying to measure up to the golden child. And I'm really fucking tired of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Mom always made them because they were *your* favorite.” Aria sneered. “I thought forgiving you and Mom might end the loop. I even went to the doc for help, but I couldn’t do it.” She pointed the gun at Millie. “You treated me like garbage and you think it's *my fault* my head is so messed up! You're just like Mom.”

The doctor took deep breaths. His hands steadied. *Focus her attention on me and keep her calm,* he thought. “Ok, Aria. Tell me what you want. And please, no more shooting.”

“That's simple, doc. I want you to shoot me.”

“No. I can't do that, Aria.” The doctor put the safety on his gun.

“Sure you can. Take the safety off and pull the trigger. But—and this is important—you have to kill me or I'll kill you. I've done it before, remember?”

Doctor Redmond trembled.

Aria tapped her temple with her index finger. “7-0, 7-0, 7-0. If something traumatic happens in the loop, it sticks around in your unconscious after the reset. Tomorrow, Millie and Phil will be scared of me though they won't know why.” Her voice rose. “*You* have to end the loop!”

He shook his head. “I won't do that.”

“Kill me or you all die!”

Phil whimpered. His eyes rolled back in his head.

“No. You won't kill anyone,” Doctor Redmond said.

Aria arched an eyebrow. “Why on Earth do you think that?”

“Because you want help. I can help you without anyone else getting hurt.”

Aria checked her phone. “They. Don't. Matter.”

Thunder rattled the house.

The doctor and Millie flinched. Blood dripped from a hole in Phil's forehead.

Millie's mouth fell open but no sound came out.

“Shoot me, doc. Or Millie is next.”

The doctor's knees gave out. He fell back onto the chair. A chair leg snapped in half, dumping him onto the floor. “This... This isn't the way.”

“I kept asking you for help. On day thirty-two thousand nine hundred, you asked me if it was fair to put all the blame on Millie and Mom. When I tried to shoot you, you shot me instead. I woke up, it was November second, and everything had reset.

“Shoot me and we'll all wake up tomorrow, the real tomorrow, and only I'll be the wiser.” Aria shrugged. “For the most part.”

“I wouldn’t have killed you... ” Doctor Redmond’s lips quivered. “No! Time loops aren't real and I didn't shoot you.”

“They are and you did. Tell the police it was self-defense. It won't matter after the devil’s hour.” Aria closed her eyes for a moment. The dark circles under her eyes looked like bruises. “I don’t age and I can’t die. If you don’t do this, it will *never* end. Never.”

“Aria—”

Aria pointed the gun at Millie. “Mom loved her most no matter what I did. You can't blame me for that.” She glanced at the time.

“No!”

Lightening flashed. Thunder cracked. Millie tipped backward onto Phil's outstretched legs. Her fingers spasmed. A crimson stain spread across the front of her pristine white blouse.

The doctor dropped the pistol. His head and shoulders sagged.

Aria knelt in front of him. “You won't shoot me, even if I say you're next. You're a stubborn one aren't you, doc?”

He said nothing.

“I know your family.”

The doctor's head snapped up. “What?”

“Liz always gets a lunchtime coffee at the cafe. Your son, Jacob, has curly red hair. Gets it from his mother.”

“How do you—”

“Your house is nice. Two-story brick colonial. White picket fence. Roses and tulips. Such a damned cliche.”

What little blood was left in Doctor Redmond’s face drained away. “Don't, Aria!”

“Kill me or I truss you up, toss you in the trunk of my car, and make you watch as I kill your adorable family. Because they don't matter either.” One corner of her mouth lifted. “I think I skipped anarchy this time and went straight to psychopath.”

She set her phone on the floor and pushed it.

It slid into Millie's hand. Her fingers lifted. A gurgling sound escaped her mouth as she dragged a bloody finger across the screen.

“Shoot me and call the cops.” Aria shrugged. “Phil's done for but maybe they can save Millie.”

Doctor Redmond stared into Aria's empty eyes. She had talked about killing her family and his as if she was discussing the weather. *She can't be reasoned with,* he thought. He had to keep his family safe. He turned to look at her phone.

Aria's eyes opened wide. She followed his gaze.

He lunged at Aria.

Aria whooped as he knocked her backward.

He grabbed her gun.

“Finally!” she yelled.

Thunder exploded, shaking the windows.

The gun went off once. Twice. Three times.

\#

Aria opened her eyes. Her phone sat on the bedside table. She ran her finger over the cold glass screen without looking at it, feeling a crusty smear. “Peanut butter or blood?”

She curled up, clutching her pillow to her chest. The past was set in stone. Her mother was dead, but her attitudes lived on in her children. A century of extra time hadn't freed Aria from old patterns of behavior. Those were set in stone, too.

She picked up her phone. The date and time appeared.

The phone crashed against the wall and knocked down a framed photo. Glass shards scattered across the floor.

Aria knelt in the sharp fragments, ignoring the pain; it would be gone tomorrow. She pulled the photo from the frame. Younger versions of Mom, Millie, and her stood together, smiling in the sun. Aria tore the picture in two, leaving herself on one side and Millie and Mom on the other. Tomorrow, the photo would be unchanged. She would be unchanged.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Kia Tigers vs. Lotte Giants: A Tale of Two KBO Powerhouses (With a Side of Gold Coins)**

The KBO’s latest blockbuster showdown pits the **Kia Tigers** against the **Lotte Giants** in a July 25 clash that’s as much about legacy as it is about runs. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game feels like a circus—complete with acrobatic pitching and fans throwing gold coins like confetti.

---

### Odds Breakdown: Giants Favor, Tigers Tread Water

The betting lines make this a lopsided lovefest for the Lotte Giants. At **decimal odds of 1.48-1.50** (implied probability: **67-69%**), the Giants are the clear favorite, while the Kia Tigers hover around **2.60** (implied probability: **38-39%**). For context, the Tigers’ chances of winning are about the same as me correctly guessing your favorite sandwich. Not great.

The spread reinforces this: Lotte is favored by **1.5 runs**, and the total is set at **10 runs**, with even money on Over/Under. If you’re betting on the Tigers, you’re essentially buying a lottery ticket—except the jackpot is a moral victory, and the ticket’s a fire hazard.

### News Digest: Gold Coins, Records, and a Star’s 2,000th Hit

The Lotte Giants are basking in the glow of **Jeon Jun-woo’s historic 2,000-hit, 1,000-RBI milestone**, celebrated with a fan-driven event that netted 12,000 congratulatory messages and 10 gold coins (because who *doesn’t* want a gold coin in their sock?). The Giants aren’t just winning games—they’re winning at fan engagement, with **39 sold-out home games** this season. Their average attendance? A staggering **27,782 per game**. If this were a coffee shop, they’d be the Starbucks of baseball.

Meanwhile, the Kia Tigers are… well, they’re the underdog. Recent news about them is sparse, save for a vague mention of their M

The devil’s hour had passed, and another day had come. Time flowed whether you were conscious of it or not. Aria rolled over in bed. She was always conscious of it. She knew exactly how much time she had wasted without being able to change anything. *A waste of time and space*, as Mom would have said. The sunlight peaking around the blackout curtains seemed to scream that she was wasting another beautiful day.

A glance around the room was an assault on her eyeballs. Dirty dishes sat between stacks of textbooks or peeked out from under piles of dirty clothes. Three moldy butter knives pinned a college acceptance letter to the wall. She sniffed herself and grimaced; she had been wearing the same pajamas forever. Ignoring the crusty smear of peanut butter on the screen, Aria checked the time on her phone. “2-1-5, 2-1-5, 2-1-5,” she whispered. Her index finger tapped the mattress as she said each number.

Someone knocked on her door. “Aria, there’s someone here to see you,” Millie said.

Aria sat up and groaned. Her whole body hurt, even her hair and teeth. “Go away.”

“Aria—”

“Just. Go. Away.” Aria banged her fist against the wall.

A man’s voice said, “Aria, my name is Doctor Hugh Redmond. Your sister asked me to speak with you. We can talk through the door if that's easier for you.”

“No, thanks. I’ve had enough doctors. You can't help me.”

“Aria, you promised. Don't be a waste of time and space,” Millie said.

Aria twitched.

“I think you’d be surprised. I’ve helped many people with similar problems,” the doctor said.

Aria snorted. “And what exactly are my problems?”

“Your sister tells me you always had a strict routine and any changes upset you. Eleven months ago, you stopped leaving your bedroom.”

“So, what kind of crazy does that make me?”

“I don’t use that word and I can't diagnose you until we've talked more.”

“You’re thinking agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive. How many times have I heard that?” Aria asked.

“Then talk to me. The more I learn about you, the better help I can offer.”

“Fine. As busy as my schedule is, I think I can squeeze you in. Send my sister downstairs and we'll talk.”

“I'm leaving,” Millie said. The stairs creaked.

“Do you have a chair? This could take a while,” Aria chuckled.

“Yes, Millie gave me one. Thank you for your consideration.”

The doctor sat on the straight-backed wooden chair. It groaned. He glanced around the small, bright, and tidy Cape Cod. Files from the previous doctors had noted that Aria’s older sister, Millie, had inherited the house when their mother died two years ago.

“How considerate of me to make you talk to a door while sitting in the least comfortable chair in the house. I don't think Millie expects you to stay long.” She laid back and put her hands under her head. “Where should I start?”

“Wherever you like, Aria.” The doctor reached into his satchel for a notepad, pen, and file. The file stated Aria was eighteen years old and highly intelligent. Clipped inside was a picture of a young woman with brown hair. The dark circles under her brown eyes and thousand-yard stare made her appear much older. He recognized that look, but nothing in her files accounted for it. He wrote the date, time, and Aria's initials on his notepad.

“Let's make it interesting. Why don't I tell you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but?” Aria asked.

“You didn't tell the other doctors the truth?”

“No fucking way! They already thought I was your garden-variety nutcase—all she needs are some blue and yellow pills and weekly chats with a doctor. But maybe I'm straight-jacket-and-padded-room-in-an-institution crazy.”

“People don't get institutionalized unless they're a danger to themselves or others.”

Aria said nothing.

“Aria? Do you want to hurt yourself or someone else?”

“Not at the moment. Lemme tell my story, doc.”

He cringed inside at the diminutive. “Ok, Aria. Please do.”

“How much time have you got?”

“Two hours.”

Aria whistled. “Wow. Who's footing this insane bill? Excuse my language.”

“I'm not at liberty to say.”

“So, my rich brother-in-law.” Aria laughed. “Guess I better give him his money's worth. Once upon a time, I had a normal life. I had a 4.0 GPA. I was taking advanced classes at the community college. I was planning to go to S\_\_\_\_\_ University on a full scholarship and major in psychology. Then, everything stopped changing.”

“What do you mean by that?”

“Ever heard of a time loop, doc?”

“A time loop?”

“It's like in one of those movies where someone lives the same day over and over. One Friday, I woke up to sunshine after weeks of rain. It was so lovely, I wished it would never end. I got my wish, and every minute since has been a living hell.”

Doctor Redmond's pen scratched across his notepad. “You’re saying you had plans for your life and then it seemed like everything stopped. You felt like you were reliving the same day.”

“There you go being all doctory, doc. I never said I *felt* like I was stuck in a time loop. I *was* stuck in a time loop. I kept reliving that same goddamned sunny Friday.”

*Possible time disorientation*, he thought. “What day is today, Aria?”

“It's Sunday the first. That Friday and all its misery finally ended. Then the recovery began, though I wouldn't say I've recovered.”

“Recovery?”

“You think you can keep reliving the same day, and then go back to normal after? I don't know what you'd call it. PTLD? Post-time loop disorder?” Aria giggled. “You lose your mind in the repetitive, unchangingness of it all. Then when everything finally changes, you lose your mind again.”

“As in you always knew what to expect and now you never know what to expect?”

“Now you're getting it, doc.”

Doctor Redmond's pen scratched again. “Is that what prompted your strict schedules?”

“I've always had strict schedules. After the loop, I stopped leaving my room because of the unpredictability. I'd forgotten how to live a normal life; the constant changes gave me panic attacks. I became a permanent, crazy fixture in my poor sister's house, with no end in sight.”

He wrote *extreme anxiety when routines are altered*. “What is a normal life to you?”

“Uh uh. No getting off topic.”

“Ok, Aria. I'll try to stay on topic.” The doctor checked his watch. One and a half hours left. “How is your relationship with your sister?”

“Verboten!” Aria sat up and poked her finger into the sandwich Millie had left her. Kettle chips spilled onto the bed. “It’s always peanut butter and jelly,” she muttered. She checked her phone. One and a half hours to go.

“Aria—”

“I'm sure you know the stages of grief, but do you know the stages of time looping?” she asked.

He jotted down *refusal to discuss relationship with sister*. “No, I don’t. What are they?”

“It starts with denial. I thought it was a nightmare I could wake myself up from. I stayed up all night. I jumped in the ice-cold lake. I pinched and punched myself. But midnight would come and I'd wake up in bed on the same Friday with no one else the wiser.

“What do you think the next stage is, doc?”

“Anger?”

“Nope. Begging. I begged God, Satan, anyone to make the loop end. I offered up my life, my soul, and my firstborn. Next stage. Any ideas?” Aria asked.

“Depression?”

“Try harder, doc. Anarchy is number three! I realized I could do anything I wanted and no one could stop me. Shoplifting. Stealing cars. Do you know what bad guys do before they rob a bank?”

“What do they do?”

“They stake the place out. I had nothing but time and the schedule never changed. I robbed stores and banks. I even robbed the mayor.” Aria's voice changed to a stage whisper. “You'd never believe the S&M dungeon he has in a hidden room. He seems like such a nice guy.”

Doctor Redmond wrote *unable to separate fantasy from reality and/or enjoys telling stories to shock*.

“Then there was arson. Molotovs work well enough, but bombs are better. Bit of a steep learning curve, though.”

“You know how to make bombs?” None of the files had mentioned violent fantasies. To be safe, the doctor noted it and wrote *have sister search Aria’s room for weapons/explosives*.

Aria nibbled at the sandwich and frowned. “Just the way Mom always made them,” she whispered. Her eyes teared up. She rubbed her face.

“Aria?”

“Depression was lucky number four! That was less fun than anarchy. I couldn't get out of bed. Everything hurt. I cried at random times. After a while, I didn't see the point in living a life that never changed, so I killed myself.”

The chair complained as the doctor sat up straighter. “You tried to kill yourself? When?”

“You're not listening. I *did* kill myself. Many times. I started painless and bloodless. Pills. A car running in a closed garage. Same thing every time. Everything went black and then I'd wake up perfectly fine on Friday morning.”

Doctor Redmond wrote *depression, suicidal ideation?* “And what about now? Do you still want to kill yourself?”

“I don't want to die, I'm not thinking about it, and I have no plans to hurt or kill myself, so you can cross out suicidal ideation.” She crunched on a chip.

Doctor Redmond blinked. Her answer would have ticked off all the boxes on a standard suicide severity questionnaire. *Studied psychology,* he wrote. The chair squeaked as he settled back. “How many times did you kill yourself?”

“Hoo boy, that's tough. I lost count after a while. When the easy stuff didn't work, I switched to more painful, bloody methods: shooting, jumping off a bridge, hanging, stabbing, and electrocution, to name a few. I even climbed into the lion cage at the zoo. That was a doozy.” Aria put the last chip between her molars and chomped down. “Those teeth cracking through my bones is not something I will ever forget. Thankfully, I bled out fast.” She shrugged. “Nothing worked.”

“Aria, I have to ask again, are you sure—”

“Know what the last stage is?”

“Aria—”

With an edge to her voice, Aria said, “The last stage, doc, or we're done.”

The doctor swallowed a sigh. If he pushed too hard, he would lose her. “What's the last stage?” He squinted at his notes in the dimming light. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

“I thought since I was the only one who knew about the loop, I was the only real person. So, I killed the others.” Aria laughed. “What would you call that stage?”

Doctor Redmond tensed. He added up the signs: withdrawal, losing touch with reality, paranoia, and violent fantasies. Textbook example of psychosis.

“You think I'm psychotic, don't cha?”

Rain pounded the roof. The doctor's hand twitched.

“Remember, doc, it's only a story. Time loops aren't real, right?”

He underlined *studied psychology* and *telling stories to shock*. “Who wasn't real?”

“Everyone. Millie, friends, strangers, the mayor. I killed them all. Even you.”

The doctor's mouth went dry. “Me?”

“I was so desperate to end the loop, I thought a shrink might help. You and I talked about vicious cycles, grief, and anger. But I didn’t like your advice, so I killed you.”

It was quiet in the hall for a long time.

“Did I scare you away, doc?”

“I'm here, Aria. I'm just processing.” He wrote *needs further examination and probable in-patient treatment.*

“I can hear the gears in your head grinding through that shit from here. How about we... forgive and move forward?”

Doctor Redmond wiped his damp palms on his slacks. Aria must have looked up his latest book, *Forgiveness and Moving Forward*. “How long were you in the time loop?”

“Nice recovery, doc! Hard to say. I couldn't write it down because it would disappear after the nightly reset. Sisyphean task! Somewhere around ninety years.”

“That’s a long time.”

“What are you, forty-four? That's old. And if you're old, I'm ancient!” Aria cackled.

He caught himself frowning. She had guessed his age without even seeing him. “When did the loop start?”

“November first last year. El Dia de los Muertos.”

The doctor sucked in a breath.

Aria smiled. “Does that mean something to you?”

Clearing his throat, the doctor said, “We're here to talk about you, Aria.” His trembling fingers fumbled with the cap of his water bottle.

“Not a good day for you for some reason. Let's see... you found out your wife was cheating? Your dog died? Your kid died?” She shoved her finger into the sandwich until red jelly seeped out. “Or you started having nightmares where someone shot you in the head and *you* died.”

The bottle thumped to the floor. Thunder boomed.

“Bingo!” Aria clapped her hands. “You laid on the floor feeling yourself dying, wishing it would end but also wishing it wouldn't. I know what that's like.”

“How... ”

“I told you, I killed you. You forgot after the reset, but maybe the trauma still lingered. Latent PTSD.” She steepled her fingers under her chin. “Iiiiinteresting.”

Doctor Redmond gripped the chair with both hands to keep from joining his bottle. “That can't... ” He gasped as if all the oxygen in the house had been used up.

“You don't sound too good, doc. Breathe slowly. Four-seven-eight. Four-seven-eight. Four-seven-eight.” Aria tapped on the wall to punctuate each number.

Doctor Redmond's face flushed. *He* was the doctor. He slowed his breaths and relaxed his tensed muscles. “I'm fine.”

Aria touched her phone screen. The soft glow illuminated the dark room. “Wanna know what happened next?”

“Please tell me,” the doctor said. His voice was steady again. He nodded to himself. He was a professional.

“The loop ended.” Aria clicked on a light. She watched a moth struggle to escape from a web behind the lampshade as the spider closed in. “I don't know why, though. To get out in the movies, you have to become a better person, learn your lesson, forgive and forget, blah blah blah. That didn't happen here. I need to know what ended the last loop so I can escape from the next one.”

“Do you think there will be another loop?”

“Who's to say?” Aria checked the time again.

*Was there any truth hidden in these stories?* the doctor thought as he rubbed his face. He would hand this case over to someone else. There wasn't anything in heaven or hell that would make him come back here.

At the same time, they both said, “Our time is up.”

“Thank you for talking with me, Aria. Unfortunately, I don't think I'm the best fit for you. I'll refer your case to another doctor.”

There was silence from the bedroom. “Aria? Are you ok?”

Bedsprings squeaked. The floor creaked. Thunder rattled the house.

Aria leaned her shoulder against the door. “I haven't been ok for decades. And you won't hand off my case. You'll be back.”

“No, Aria.” He stood and dropped his things into his satchel, closing it with a flick of his wrist. “I won't be back.”

The bedroom door cracked open. A small plate rolled out on its edge. Doctor Redmond jumped as it hit his foot, tipped over, and clattered to the ground. He knelt to pick it up.

Thunder exploded, shaking the windows.

A picture of a blue sugar skull grinned up at him. Blobs of red jelly dripped down its forehead.

Aria licked her fingertips. “You know, doc, I wouldn't be so sure.”

\#

Aria poked the sandwich her sister had left. “Fucking peanut butter and jelly.” She checked the time. “9-5-5-9, 9-5-5-9, 9-5-5-9,” she said, tapping her finger on the plate in time to the numbers.

The stairs groaned. “Showtime.”

Someone knocked on the door. “Aria, there’s someone here to see you,” Millie said.

“And who might that be, sister dear?” Aria said with saccharine sweetness. She heard Millie suck in a breath.

“Aria, my name is Doctor Hugh Redmond. Your sister asked me to speak with you. We can talk through the door if that's easier for you.”

“Sure. Send my sister away and we'll talk.”

“I'm leaving,” Millie said. The stairs creaked.

“Ok, doc, why don't you pull up that uncomfortable, not very sturdy chair Millie left you?”

Doctor Redmond turned. There was a straight-backed wooden chair behind him. He suppressed a sigh. It would be an uncomfortable two-hour session. The chair complained as he sat. He pulled a notepad and pen from his satchel and jotted down *Patient: A.Z., Session: one, Date: November 1st*. He reached for her file.

“I think I'd like to talk face to face.” Aria opened the door. She leaned against the door jamb with her hands clasped behind her and stared at the doctor. He was middle-aged and average-looking. Sandy hair and eyes. Business casual dress. He looked like he sounded.

“Thank you, Aria. I hope—”

“We can make some progress today,” Aria finished.

He cleared his throat and glanced at his notepad. “Well, yes. We should get you a chair, too.”

“No thanks. I’m good.”

“Ok, Aria. What would you like to talk about?”

“Well, today I’m going to try something different.”

“Can you tell me what you mean by that?” the doctor asked.

“TLDR, I’m stuck in a time loop, again, and I want out. Wanna know how many times we’ve had this conversation?”

“Time loop? Can you—”

“Same day over and over but only I remember it. Nine thousand five hundred and fifty-nine times—that’s over nine thousand goddamned peanut butter sandwiches and it’s-nice-to-meet-you’s. I have to keep repeating the day number so I don't lose track, though once you get to five digits, it doesn't seem worth it anymore.”

“You feel like you’re stuck in the same day?”

Aria frowned. “No matter what I do, you never change.”

“We’ve never met before, Aria.”

“We have and I’ll prove it, doc.” Aria raised her right arm, pointing a .22 caliber pistol toward Doctor Redmond. “Does this seem familiar?”

The doctor paled and stood with his hands raised. “Aria, you don’t need that. We can just talk.”

“Oh, but I do need it. It’s time to shake things up.” Aria yelled down the stairs without taking her eyes off him, “Hey, Millie! Phil! Would you mind coming up here? The good doctor needs to speak with you!”

The doctor opened his mouth, but Aria shook her head.

They heard Millie and Phil moving towards the stairs.

“Waste of time,” Phil said.

Millie whispered, “Keep your voice down!”

Phil harrumphed. “Don't know why she demanded *him*. Certainly costs enough.” The stairs creaked. Stepping onto the landing, they looked from the doctor to Aria and froze.

Phil’s mouth closed and opened convulsively like a fish out of water.

Millie said, “Aria! What—”

“Be quiet, sister dear. Your role isn't a speaking one.”

Phil glanced at the stairs.

The gun barrel moved toward him. “Stay put, dear brother.”

Phil yelped and backed against the wall.

“So, doc. This is what I need from you.” Aria pulled her left hand from behind her. In it, was another pistol. She crouched and slid it across the polished wood floor.

Doctor Redmond flinched when the gun hit his foot. “What are you doing, Aria? This isn’t going to help.”

The hall darkened. Thunder rumbled in the distance.

“You think you’re a smart guy, but you don’t know anything. I’ve got ninety years on you.” Aria clicked on the hall light with her free hand. Her smile didn't reach her eyes. “Pick up the gun.”

“Aria, you don't need to—”

“Pick up the gun or I *will* shoot.” Aria's brown eyes stared into Millie's green ones. “Remember when we used to decide who was it?”

Rain pounded the roof. The gun barrel moved between the three of them. “Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief. Doctor...” The gun pointed at Doctor Redmond. “Miss Perfect... ” It moved to Millie. “Asshole... ” It swung to Phil.

“Ok!” the doctor picked up the gun but kept it pointed at the ground.

Aria chuckled. “Point it at me, silly. They don’t matter.”

“Everyone matters, Aria.” His voice quivered.

“Right now, only you and I matter.” Aria pulled her phone from her pocket and checked the time.

“The neighbors will hear the gunshots and call the police,” the doctor said.

Thunder boomed.

Phil screamed and slid to the floor. Blood blossomed through his khaki pants.

Millie shrieked. She knelt and pressed her hands over the hole in his thigh. “Call 911!”

“Sorry, that'll have to wait,” Aria said.

“Aria!” Millie cried. “Oh my god… ”

“Your move, doc.”

Doctor Redmond stepped back. The backs of his knees bumped the chair. His breath hitched.

Aria smiled wide. “That chair's not as sturdy as it seems.”

The doctor’s body twitched.

“No matter how many times you've thrown it at me, it doesn't end this.”

“I wasn't going to—”

“You were. 5-7, 5-7, 5-7.” Aria tapped the door jam with her phone as she said each number. “You've thrown that chair fifty-seven times. If you even look like you're thinking about it, I'll shoot Millie.”

Millie gasped and turned toward Aria.

“Is that surprising, sister dear? You think I'm a waste of time and space. Today’s session was my last chance before you tossed me in the looney bin.”

Millie opened her mouth.

“Don't deny it. I'm tired of trying to measure up to the golden child. And I'm really fucking tired of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Mom always made them because they were *your* favorite.” Aria sneered. “I thought forgiving you and Mom might end the loop. I even went to the doc for help, but I couldn’t do it.” She pointed the gun at Millie. “You treated me like garbage and you think it's *my fault* my head is so messed up! You're just like Mom.”

The doctor took deep breaths. His hands steadied. *Focus her attention on me and keep her calm,* he thought. “Ok, Aria. Tell me what you want. And please, no more shooting.”

“That's simple, doc. I want you to shoot me.”

“No. I can't do that, Aria.” The doctor put the safety on his gun.

“Sure you can. Take the safety off and pull the trigger. But—and this is important—you have to kill me or I'll kill you. I've done it before, remember?”

Doctor Redmond trembled.

Aria tapped her temple with her index finger. “7-0, 7-0, 7-0. If something traumatic happens in the loop, it sticks around in your unconscious after the reset. Tomorrow, Millie and Phil will be scared of me though they won't know why.” Her voice rose. “*You* have to end the loop!”

He shook his head. “I won't do that.”

“Kill me or you all die!”

Phil whimpered. His eyes rolled back in his head.

“No. You won't kill anyone,” Doctor Redmond said.

Aria arched an eyebrow. “Why on Earth do you think that?”

“Because you want help. I can help you without anyone else getting hurt.”

Aria checked her phone. “They. Don't. Matter.”

Thunder rattled the house.

The doctor and Millie flinched. Blood dripped from a hole in Phil's forehead.

Millie's mouth fell open but no sound came out.

“Shoot me, doc. Or Millie is next.”

The doctor's knees gave out. He fell back onto the chair. A chair leg snapped in half, dumping him onto the floor. “This... This isn't the way.”

“I kept asking you for help. On day thirty-two thousand nine hundred, you asked me if it was fair to put all the blame on Millie and Mom. When I tried to shoot you, you shot me instead. I woke up, it was November second, and everything had reset.

“Shoot me and we'll all wake up tomorrow, the real tomorrow, and only I'll be the wiser.” Aria shrugged. “For the most part.”

“I wouldn’t have killed you... ” Doctor Redmond’s lips quivered. “No! Time loops aren't real and I didn't shoot you.”

“They are and you did. Tell the police it was self-defense. It won't matter after the devil’s hour.” Aria closed her eyes for a moment. The dark circles under her eyes looked like bruises. “I don’t age and I can’t die. If you don’t do this, it will *never* end. Never.”

“Aria—”

Aria pointed the gun at Millie. “Mom loved her most no matter what I did. You can't blame me for that.” She glanced at the time.

“No!”

Lightening flashed. Thunder cracked. Millie tipped backward onto Phil's outstretched legs. Her fingers spasmed. A crimson stain spread across the front of her pristine white blouse.

The doctor dropped the pistol. His head and shoulders sagged.

Aria knelt in front of him. “You won't shoot me, even if I say you're next. You're a stubborn one aren't you, doc?”

He said nothing.

“I know your family.”

The doctor's head snapped up. “What?”

“Liz always gets a lunchtime coffee at the cafe. Your son, Jacob, has curly red hair. Gets it from his mother.”

“How do you—”

“Your house is nice. Two-story brick colonial. White picket fence. Roses and tulips. Such a damned cliche.”

What little blood was left in Doctor Redmond’s face drained away. “Don't, Aria!”

“Kill me or I truss you up, toss you in the trunk of my car, and make you watch as I kill your adorable family. Because they don't matter either.” One corner of her mouth lifted. “I think I skipped anarchy this time and went straight to psychopath.”

She set her phone on the floor and pushed it.

It slid into Millie's hand. Her fingers lifted. A gurgling sound escaped her mouth as she dragged a bloody finger across the screen.

“Shoot me and call the cops.” Aria shrugged. “Phil's done for but maybe they can save Millie.”

Doctor Redmond stared into Aria's empty eyes. She had talked about killing her family and his as if she was discussing the weather. *She can't be reasoned with,* he thought. He had to keep his family safe. He turned to look at her phone.

Aria's eyes opened wide. She followed his gaze.

He lunged at Aria.

Aria whooped as he knocked her backward.

He grabbed her gun.

“Finally!” she yelled.

Thunder exploded, shaking the windows.

The gun went off once. Twice. Three times.

\#

Aria opened her eyes. Her phone sat on the bedside table. She ran her finger over the cold glass screen without looking at it, feeling a crusty smear. “Peanut butter or blood?”

She curled up, clutching her pillow to her chest. The past was set in stone. Her mother was dead, but her attitudes lived on in her children. A century of extra time hadn't freed Aria from old patterns of behavior. Those were set in stone, too.

She picked up her phone. The date and time appeared.

The phone crashed against the wall and knocked down a framed photo. Glass shards scattered across the floor.

Aria knelt in the sharp fragments, ignoring the pain; it would be gone tomorrow. She pulled the photo from the frame. Younger versions of Mom, Millie, and her stood together, smiling in the sun. Aria tore the picture in two, leaving herself on one side and Millie and Mom on the other. Tomorrow, the photo would be unchanged. She would be unchanged.

1m8o336,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1m8o336/fellowshipping/,“fellowshipping”,"31M. I’m 15 months sober and loving it. I go to 1-3 meetings a week and I went to a new meeting tonight. 

My parents met in AA 35+ years ago so I grew up very indoctrinated with AA stuff. Therefore, I rejected it when I was young as sort of the “religion” I was raised in. So it took me a very long time to finally stop being a know it all miserable drunk and go to rehab. I was arrogant, and you guessed it, thought I was going to quit on my own or “some other way” besides AA. I guess I found it cringe and judgey and hypocritical… I thought I knew everything about it, being raised “in” it, but never truly giving it a chance. I was pleasantly surprised and welcomed with open arms. The only thing that got me sober was taking other people’s advice. 

Here’s the thing. The #1 reason I started and continued drinking was social anxiety. I have done a lot of work on this, including rehab, IOP, weekly therapy, a social anxiety clinic, and meetings and stepwork. 

My ENTIRE family (my dad & mom + her 6 siblings, my siblings, my cousins) are in AA. All their friends are from AA. I think that’s beautiful and lucky and rare. I also think it’s a little much sometimes. I have said from the beginning to my very codependent family that my sobriety needs to be my own, and I have stuck to that. My brother is pretty much the opposite of me: total social butterfly and has a million friends in AA. 

I feel SOOO fucking awkward at meetings. Like, I’ll talk to people, I’ll share, I’ll read, whatever. But at the end I just wanna get the fuck out of there. An hour a day plus prayers and readings at home is kind of all I can spare. I don’t understand how people have so much time for 5+ meetings a week + always dinner or coffee after, every single time. I get that it’s their social life, that’s who their friends are. But it doesn’t feel natural to me? My social battery runs out very quickly. It’s not that I don’t like them or feel superior or something, I just really don’t feel the need to introduce myself and hang around, turning a meeting into a several hour event. Sobriety IS my priority, but making a bunch of friends really is not. 

The topic of the meeting tonight was about loneliness/fellowship and how it’s an essential part of AA. I absolutely couldn’t have gotten sober without the AA community, but it’s also not my entire personality and social life? 

Am I doing it wrong? I feel good about my sobriety, I don’t have any cravings or urge to drink. But I always feel guilty that I skrrt out of there when the meeting ends, or that I’m not doing enough service work or something. (Yes, I was also raised Catholic-ish and the guilt runs deep). I’ve heard people say they stopped calling 5 alcoholics a day and that’s what eventually led them to relapse. But like, that’s my personal hell, I hate phone calls. 

I met a guy once who was sort of an AA drifter, he rarely went to the same meeting twice. I wish I could do that but I’m afraid people will think I’m either a) rude or b) well on my way to the drunk tank. 

TL;DR Can you do AA without the nonstop “fellowshipping”? ",3,1753412251.0,alcoholicsanonymous,4,1.0,False

It’s only been three days without redbull and it’s going horribly. I slept for 9 hours last night, woke up and had a latte, sat in some zoom meetings, then took a two hour nap from 1-3 (I wfh), and now I’m in bed ready to sleep for 9-10 more hours.

1m8ns5d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m8ns5d,"Canadian trip, part 2: Winnipeg - Edmonton","Hi everyone. I'm glad to see that many of you enjoyed my report on the first leg of my trip through Canada by train. I'm back with the second part, although this one is a bit shorter than the first.

*Monday, July 21st*

We arrive at Winnipeg's train station at 8pm, having enjoyed four days in the city. Back on the Toronto-Winnipeg leg of the journey we were warned by a few Canadians that we would get bored in Winnipeg without a car and that there's nothing going on in the city, but honestly? We loved it. The Forks with its parks and shops, the museums, and the Winnipeg Fringe with great performances turned our stay there into an absolute highlight of the trip. If any of you plan a trip through Canada, I highly recommend paying Winnipeg a visit.

Still, we're happy to start our second train trip because we loved the first one so much. The train is supposed to arrive ad 7.30 pm and depart at 9.30 pm, but of course, that almost never happens. Today, there's a 80 minute delay, which isn't too bad, and boarding is announced for 9.20, so we sit and wait for a bit. It's less comfortable than the wait in Toronto, because there is no lounge for sleeper plus passengers and the waiting area is very basic and functional. Still, it's pleasant enough and the people watching is way more entertaining, because there is more of a mix. There are more families this time, some with younger kids, and they're dressed in comfortable clothes, clutching pillows and blankets, clearly preparing for a night on semi comfortable train seats. I used to do night trains on seats in Europe all the time when I was a student. I sure don't miss it.

Boarding starts with a 20 minute delay. We're in Car 15 and have Berths 1U and 1L this time. Closer to the toilets then Berths 3, but during daytime, there's a window on both sides while in 3 you're next to a wall on one side. I'm looking forward to snuggling into my blankets, so I don't even wait for the attendant to talk to us about the safety features to get myself ready for bed. When he tells us that in case of an emergency, we should make sure there are no bears before we climb out of the window, I'm already tucked in. Somewhere between 10 and 11pm, we depart. I'm out like a light before we leave Winnipeg behind us.

*Tuesday, July 22nd*

Like last time, I wake up shortly before 5. It's grey and foggy outside, from the wildfires up north, as I'm later told. I grab a coffee from the activity car and head up to the dome, which is almost empty, and enjoy the landscape. Where Ontario impressed me with an abundance of lakes and trees, Manitoba does so with its flatness and its vastness. There is so much space and so much sky, I find it almost terrifying. It's mainly agricultural, with huge yellow fields of what I believe are oilseed crops. The dome car fills up as it gets closer to breakfast time (6.30) and I get a hot chocolate and head back to my berth to watch the fields some more as I wait for my partner. 

We head for breakfast at 8, she has the omelette and I have the transcontinental breakfast without the hash brown. I forgot to take a picture, but her omelette looked like an omelette and my transcontinental looked like fried eggs, bacon and toast. Both are delicious. We ask about the mealtimes, because we couldn't choose our seating when checking in at Winnipeg. We're told there are only two seatings this time. We choose the second, which is at 1.30pm for lunch and 7pm for dinner. That should leave us with enough time to eat dinner before getting off at Edmonton, where scheduled arrival is 8.50 pm. Emphasis on *should*. I'll get to that later.

One thing we notice is that this train isn't as cold as the last one, where my partner basically had to wear three layers to fend off a cold from the AC. It's much more comfortable in the dome car like that, so we spend the morning up there. The car never fills up completely, so we can stay there without feeling bad about hogging the seats. 

There's a 30 minute stop at Saskatoon and we get off to find...not much. The train station is well outside the city. That seems to be the case for many Canadian train stations, whereas in Europe, they're usually in the city center. We still enjoy the chance to stretch our legs.

Lunch is a smoked beef sandwich for me and vegetarian chili for my partner. It's delicious as expected, but the highlight is the apple crumble we get for dessert. Definitely the best dessert we've had on the train so far. 

I spend most of the afternoon in the dome car again, while my partner enjoys the more spacious benches downstairs. I drink my body weight in coffee and watch as a wilder version of the prairies appears, with gentle slopes and grasslands rather than fields of crops, the kind you know from movies. It's beautiful, and I enjoy it even more when wine tasting begins. 

When the first seating for dinner is called, my partner joins me in the dome car again. Shortly before 7pm, the landscape suddenly becomes more urban and in the distance, skyscrapers appear. We wonder what city this is, until an announcement tells us: it's Edmonton! We're told that we can leave our train at 7.20pm, 90 minutes before we were supposed to arrive, and also 10 minutes before our meal seating. Our attendant in car 15 is as surprised as us, and he tells us that he's never seen the train arrive this early. He tells us that we can stay on the train to have our meal, but then we have to wait 2 hours before we have the chance to get off again, because the train has to leave the station between arrival and departure. We opt to skip dinner and head to our hostel instead. It's too bad about dinner, but we'd rather get to bed early, because we're starting a road trip through the Rockies in a rental car the next day. The attendant still feels sorry for us and hands us a few chocolates. 

We leave the train and collect our checked baggage at the tiny station which is - surprise- well outside of Edmonton. Taxis are lining up to pick up new arrivals, so getting to our hostel is still very easy.

All in all, I enjoyed the second leg just as much as the first one, even though arrival didn't quite go as planned. We were told to expect delays but we weren't quite as prepared for arriving too early. Still, I'd never complain. It's part of the experience. And I can't wait for part 3.

P.S.: I'm writing this from the balcony at a beautiful lodge outside Golden, BC, looking across the Columbia river at the Rocky Mountains. As much as I'm enjoying the Canadian, taking it in sections and having time to explore this beautiful country in between was the right decision for us. I highly recommend this approach to anyone who's never been to Canada before.",39,1753411341.0,ViaRail,2,1.0,False

by Nelson Rodriguez

So many choices… but where to go?
all I hear is silence.
my instinct telling me to move—
The mind paralyzed by failure,

fearful of the adversary afoot.

The mountain…
the one I fear to climb.

My doubts, necromanced—
smirking through the voices
of ghosts I thought I buried.

Reminded of my past versions,
frozen…
screams preserved in ice.

But the longer I wait,
the colder it gets—
burdened by the truth
that a decision must be made.

Then courage erupts,
provoked—enraged
by fear and its lies.

Like hot coffee on a winter morning,
I feel it sink into me,
its warmth spreading through my chest…
thawing out the part of me that still believes.

It chants:
“I can.
I will.
I must.”

I had 3 “bridesmaids,” one of whom is my sister. I put bridesmaids in quotes because it was really only a title. I let them pick their own dresses, let them decide on their own shoes, hair, makeup, etc. and didn’t ask for a shower, bachelorette party, or anything else. I bought their bouquets, and while they stood up there with me, they didn’t have to walk down the aisle or make speeches or anything like that. They did have to purchase their plane tickets and lodging to attend the wedding. I wanted to get them each a little something to thank them for making the trip out. I wrote them each a heartfelt thank you note and got them each a candle from a local candlemaker, a bag of chocolates from a local chocolate place, a nice lip scrub, and a coffee giftcard. Now I’m worried that it wasn’t enough. My bridesmaids went above and beyond setting up decorations for a mini surprise shower and getting me gifts such as a custom jacket, lingerie, and monetary gifts. None of this was expected at all, and I am so grateful, but now I’m worried that my gift to them was cheap and underwhelming. I see so many brides getting elaborate gifts for the wedding party, but I didn’t think that was necessary since I had such a small wedding and tried to keep expectations and costs as low as possible. Plus gifts aren’t my love language, I’m really not a “stuff” person and don’t like giving stuff for the sake of giving stuff. But now I’m self conscious that I didn’t do enough.

FINALLY mustered up the courage to say something and the barista quite literally just stares at me for an absolute eternity. No expression at all. Made me think I came off karenly and seriously wanted to crawl up and hide. We’re in this like… standoff(??) where I’m anxiously stuttering and she’s just glaring at me. 

Eventually a saviour (another employee) arrives and by now I’m a huge anxious mess. I go “Oh is there coffee in this?” And some other stuttery nonsense before she say’s she’ll remake the drink, probably to save me from myself at this point. 

By now I’m regretting all my life choices and go “Oh no it’s fine!!” (The hell girl?? Thank goodness she insisted on remaking it).

The other barista sorta continues staring at me then at last speaks her first words… “It’s tea. Not coffee.” 

Okay girlypop don’t hit me please 🙏

1m8nf1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1m8nf1c/step_brother_from_nightmares/,Step Brother from Nightmares.,"Hi there. I have a little story I got told by my friend, I do have the consent to put it here

To start off, Kiera and Mark have been together for around 6 years all in all and they are big gamers (met in a game, different countries). She met his whole family including Marks brother and step brother and have played games online with both of them. The step brother (lets call him Richard) was great towards Kiera, Even though there were some underlying anger issues when they did bad in games but she decided to ignore it. After some time I advised her to speak to Mark about it and he said that there has been many instances of the step brother chasing them around with a knife when they were kids, hanging one of the brothers out of the window by his legs etc. We were both very weirded out by this and she was a little worried to continue having contact with Richard but I told her he was a trouble as a child, he has grown (he is 45 yo or so now) and she should move on for the sake of the family. 

When Mark and Kiera got married she moved to his country and they were living with his mum, brother (lets call him Theo) and his ""step dad"" (his mum never married him but he's more of a father to Mark than his biological dad). The step dad (lets call him Steve) did not like Richard whatsoever, they did not talk, they also had a physical fight at one point and cut off all contact which was a bit hard on Marks mum since she is Richards mum at the end of the day. 

After some time Steve and Kieras mother in law decided to split and since it was Steves house he moved out to a different house and decided to let Kiera, Mark, mother in law and Theo rent it for the time being. Having in mind it was basically a whole family in the house Theo wanted Richard to move in as well, mother in law was obviously on board with it straight away since Richard lived in his friends living room because he has not worked for more than 3 weeks in his whole life so he cannot afford anything else. They persuaded Steve to allow Richard to move in even with Steves warnings that they will regret it. 

  
Low and behold, Richard has moved in. Everything is nice, everyone has their own room, Richard is making coffees for the whole family in the mornings. Amazing brother.... One might think.

  
As the time went by, Richard started being annoyed by small things. Like who did not wash up a plate after their dinner? Why are you brushing teeth at 2am on a weekend when he is trying to sleep once in a blue moon? How dare you listen to music when showering at 4pm, he is still sleeping because he has no work and plays games till 6am! (his room was next to the bathroom but all of these are not loud things, how can he hear teeth brushing through the wall???) ""MY GOD STOP STOMPING DOWN THE STAIRS ITS TOO LOUD!"" He slowly but steady started to be vile in the group chat, calling everyone names, telling people that they are tramps for not cleaning a plate, saying how they are all dirty when he is the one walking in shoes and expects everyone else to hoover the house (because he just rents his room, not the house) and then shouts and has a tantrum when people do hoover at 1pm. 

All of this started to be too much and they were looking for a way to kick him out. Which, you guessed it, none of them could do because it would ""break mother in law"" to kick her son on the streets (the eviction notice was given but he decided to ignore it so they all lived with Richards decision). It got to a point where Kiera was so terrified of him that she asked to install a door lock on their door because of the sudden anger fits and name calling, shouting etc... 

One time Richard called his own mum a ""fatty C-word\* and Mark absolutely lost it. He was ready to beat him up. He did not but another shouting competition occurred. Plus the police was called to kick him out but they couldn't do anything since it was domestic.

Some time later Richard had another fit, this time while Mark was at work so Kiera called me to be with her even just on the phone. There was no shouting but Richard was being vile over messages in the group chat. The reason? Someone did not wash the pot and a couple of plates from last nights dinner (which funny enough, were Richards but he smokes the whacky tobaccy and forgets things...) And in that ""keyboard warrior"" moment of Richards, he told Kiera to ""off herself"" and insulted Mark in any hurtful way he could, name calling, saying Marks life is miserable (basically deflecting and describing himself to which we all kind of had a laugh). That was the moment she decided shes had enough and I advised her to speak to Mark and make a moving out plan. 

They moved out after not speaking or paying attention to Richard for about 5 months. They went no contact with him, blocked him from everything, 0 attention for him. 

Theo, his girlfriend (that moved in even before that keyboard warrior moment, yes, she was terrified of him as well) and the mother in law lived with Richard for about 7 months more and then after many arguments and Richards sudden anger lashings decided that enough is enough. They waited for him to go to the shop and changed the locks on the door. 

Richard came back to the house, realised that the doors were locked and decided to shout through the letterbox opening that he will call the police. Which he did and the police decided that they all had the grounds to kick him out since he was a lodger, not a tenant. So he was gone. Even his own mother said she doesn't feel too bad about it, she feels at peace because there are no more arguments.

  
FAST FORWARD A COUPLE WEEKS LATER

Theo is at work, mother in law is at work. The only person in the house is Theos girlfriend. Loud knock on the door. Theos girlfriend checks the outdoor camera. Richard.

But he is not alone, no. He brought some ""locksmith"" friend. Theos girlfriend starts panicking. Richards locksmith friend starts drilling into the door lock and gets the door open. They thought no one was in the house hence why they decided it was the right moment. Theos girlfriend shouts that she is on the phone with the police and Richard says there is nothing that they can do and locks himself into his old room. 

Theo comes back from work early because of all the calls and the situation at hand. Jumps into the house through the window because the locks have been changed by Richard. Waits for the police to come and the police escorted him out because it was considered breaking and entering and goes to custody.

Some time later they all offered Richard multiple chances to pick up his stuff and he wanted to come over at the time everyone was at work and then procceded to throw a fit because no one would take a day off work to get his stuff outside to him. IMAGINE. So because he refused to come pick the stuff up, Theo sells one of his items to replace the door because in the process of drilling the door lock, they broke the door. After finding out that his item was missing, Richard decided to sue Theo for it. 

  
As far as I am informed by Kiera, there have not been any new updates about it other than it being decided that a small claims court will be held for it. Which with all that I've been told, I believe will go into Theos favour....

I can tell you that as a young man in my mid 20s, and a job seeker in the current job market - after applying to over 270 white collar and 50 bridge jobs since lay off in February, after being strung along by the hiring processes- after experiencing how much rent and groceries consumes of my income- how I needed to sublease with roommates in a small room to make ends meet on a nationally above average salary- I don’t fully blame these men for not wanting to keep trying.

I have a masters degree from a good university but I can say I’m definitely starting to have thoughts of just dropping out like these guys they are talking about and just living minimally. I really don’t want to do that but if I keep applying for dozens of jobs with no results I’ll just get more discouraged. Plus what if you do receive a job offer and you just get laid off from that one?

I’m even being rejected for jobs in small towns in the middle of nowhere and coffee shops and retail say they aren’t hiring. 

Maybe so many people aren’t lazy and refusing to put in effort but more just emotionally exhausted

My wife and I spent time reading through the comments, discussing what we really want to see and trying our best to plan in a way that makes sense for us and our kids.  I am hoping to run it by everyone one more time to see if we are now in better shape.  We are starting from Haines Falls and I have included what Google Maps tells me are the drive times:

Day 1 - Sunday

* Leave CT at 9 - Stop at Olana which is on our way to Haines Falls/AirBNB
* AirBNB, relax and unpack until 3:30
* 10 min drive to Hunter Sky Ride OR North South Lake to swim
* 20 Min drive to Subversive Brewing for dinner

Day 2 - Monday

* Morning: Hike to Kaatersall Falls viewing platform and maybe to the bottom if the mood is right
* 4 Min drive back to Air BNB
* Lunch/Relax at home
* 24 Min drive to Opus 40 - Spend an hour or so
* 10 Min drive to Woodstock - Explore downtown (NEED RECS FOR THINGS TO SEE WITH KIDS)
* Possible dinner in Woodstock (NEED RECS) OR drive 20 min to Saugerties for dinner (Thinking the Dutch?)
* Dessert in the town we eat dinner in

Day 3 

* 1 hour drive to Peekamoose Blue Hole early
* Stop at Bread Alone for Pastry and coffee on ride home
* Lunch home
* Possible 10 min drive to Colgate lake  to swim depending on energy
* Return home to rest
* 26 min drive to Rail Explorers for River Run tour at 4:00
* Dinner at Phoenicia Diner around 6

Day 4

* Leave by 9:30
* 1 hour drive to Kingston
* Explore town 
* Lunch (NEED RECS)
* Possible Solaris tour, but might not be good for our kids in particular.  Needs recs for other things to do
* Snack at Rough Draft
* Drive Home

  
Does this seem more realistic?  Do I really need to see Kingston or is there a better way to spend the return day?  It would add an hour to my trip.

The sunset cut slip thin across the horizon before I took my last exit. Nothing in the world rests on the eyes like the gold made over the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I’ve been driving for fourteen hours, and though I’ve had a few stops for gas, food, and coffee, this is the first actual stretch of rest I’ve been afforded. You can call me Red, my car is an abused Nissan Cube , her name is Darla. We live together. I’ve been homeless for six years now.

  
  


Despite how bad it might seem living the way I do. I’m not all gloom and misery. Life is simple, I drive places, I make money to get gas, and then I drive to more places. I’ve seen more countryside than most folks dream about. I’ve been on more roads than anyone I’ve ever heard of. The only thing I worry about is the closest pit-stop.

  
  


I’ve got Freedom from everything I could ever worry about. Jean Paul Sartre said we’re all doomed to be free. I disagree, I think the real doom is knowing you *could be* free, and knowing you’ll never take the chance. Don’t like your job? Quit. Don’t like your family? Leave. Don’t like your friends? Stop seeing them. You don’t wanna live with the consequences of those choices? Don’t make em.

  
  


Some nights pass quickly, Others nights aren’t as easy. Though I chose to live this way, the primal jelly inside my skull, the Part of me as old as stone, weeps like a sickly child for company. Humans are social animals after all. I hate those nights. To put my head at ease, I play a game with other drivers.

Only on the lonely roads. I’ll find myself a car, and I’ll trail behind them. I don’t ride their ass or anything, I just stay by them. They have no idea where I’m going, they have no reason to fear me, they have nothing to say. When you’re flying down Route-66 for three hours at four in the morning, having a car to drive with lets it all melt into halcyon road trips. A few hours in, they always peel away and then I’m alone, the jelly in my head is satisfied.

  
  


Sometimes I run into someone else doing the same. A car as rough as mine, a driver as tired as me, and trailing along as we both wait to go our separate ways. Whenever I run into a person like this, I do my best to follow their road as long as I can. This is a connection that means more to me. Makes me feel like I’m not the only ghost on the road. My life might sound a bit strange to people not in my place, though my place is a strange one to be.

  
  


Recently, I ran into a ghost who felt like a mirror on wheels. They drove a Black 1970 Ford pickup which wore its age like a whore wears perfume. The car felt like part of the road, and as I trailed behind I started to lose track of the hours. It felt different than the other people I’ve seen. Once Darla needed fuel, I pulled away so I could get her what she needed. I figured this shadow of mine would want their privacy back. Although to my surprise the Ford followed. 

  
  


What was odd, was that at first I didn’t feel uneasy about it. The roads were kind, the weather still. Stars poured out across the night, our tires sung an empty song to the endless desert all around us. After a while I felt at home, and that’s when it terrified me. I felt a shackle snap shut around my throat. For a moment I felt like I had a brother again. With a lonely Gas Stop in the distance, I resolved to leave this Stranger, to forget this feeling.

  
  


I had walked into this nowhere Gas Station, the place reeking of cleaning chemicals and stale air. Crowded Aluminum Isles packed to bursting with fossilized candies, off brand Beef Jerky, toiletries, and Cough Medicine. The Clerk was a woman in her fifties. Hair like dry white grass, skin like tissue stained by time. Her Sun-bleached uniform told of decades in the same place. She drank black coffee from a Styrofoam cup. The lines on her face dug in like canyons, cracked beside eyes mourning a life she could have had. She reminded me of my Mother.

  
  


She politely pretended not to watch as I roamed the isles, gathering what I needed. Bottled water, jerky, crackers, instant coffee, razors, shaving cream, batteries, duct tape, pliers, pills for caffeine, and sleep. Even with her in the room, I finally felt alone again.

  
  


“30 on 5.” I grunted, placing my items on the counter. I didn’t want to speak, my throat was dry.

  
She looked at me with those sad eyes, and smiled. “Got everythin’ ya need hun?” her voice was milk-candy, and cold hands.

  
  


I couldn’t muster much of a smile. I just nodded as pleasantly as I could. After the Driver followed me, I was here to forget. Part of me felt like I should help her, get some of the sadness out of her eyes somehow. Maybe a kind word, a smile, something? She told me what I owed.

  
  


“You have a nice day now darlin’.” she smiled, and sipped her coffee.

  
  


I went back to my Darla, content to get back on the road. Before I got to her door, the smell of leather and whiskey hit the back of my throat like buckshot.

“Heya Tex, nice drivin’ back there.” said the man “Fancy we getting’ to the same spot. Lass at the counter looks half dead tho, she any help?”

  
  
For a moment I thought he was in my head. He was layers of fine denim worn down by decades of use. Dark as a shadow, and slim as a knife. His face was a road map written by tobacco stains and bad choices. He had a voice like cigar smoke, and with that Black Ford behind him; I knew who he was right away. The Driver found me again.

  
  


I couldn't move as His eyes cut through me, they were a shade of ice. Two frozen mountaintops far into a valley I'd never want to visit. His stare nailed my tongue to the roof of my mouth, though the jelly in my head pried it loose.



  “Yep” I said, my throat dry, my voice disused.

  
  


“Good to hear, damn it’s been what, twelve hours since my last stop?” his accent was thick with brambles and hickory. “Where you headed there Tex?”

  
  


“Nowhere.” I replied. The Jelly was feasting on this, Something about this man was lighting torches of the past in my head.

  
  
“I’m headed past Nowhere myself, you lookin’ fer company? Since we’re both goin’ the same way figured I’d ask.” his voice became a shot of whiskey. It went down just as well.

  
  


“Sure.” was all I could manage. That word slipped out of me, because under his teeth, inside his tongue, I could hear my older brother. The last time I had seen him was at his funeral. He was wearing all black too.

  
  
“Well alright then! Lemme go check in the pit, grab some grub, and get in the ol’ beater. I’ll follow yer’ lead.” The Driver sauntered through the Nowhere Station like a cowboy into a silent movie.

  
  
As I fed Darla, I sat in a stunned silence. I felt violated, I felt lost. What part of my head is so fragile that it broke so easily. It was years since the Funeral. It has been over a decade since Family rang in me as anything other than regret. In the quiet pump of the gas, I heard my Father, in the stillness of the air I heard my Mother. In my breathing, was their violence. I thought I would never think of them again.

  
  


The Driver was still inside, I could see him through the window. He spoke to the sad-eyed cashier, and for an instant made eye contact with me over her shoulder. It felt like a Rattlesnake at my feet. He smiled like a razor-blade, and waved. I raised a hand, and waved back. Darla finished eating, I put the pump away. My hands began shaking. I drove away without a word. I did not wait for this shadow of a man to leave the building.

  
  


I told myself I was seeing things, that it was exhaustion clouding my vision. I knew there were only two people in that building. There were three cars in the lot. One for the Cashier, one for the Driver, one for me. I knew this as sure as I knew the sound of tires on asphalt. But in that moment when the Driver smiled, just over his shoulder, I saw my brother staring back at me.

  
  


I drove quiet, I focused on the wheel in my hands. I felt like a man falling off a building, trying to argue the ground out of the way. After two more hours, I decided to rest. I decided to leave the Man in Black behind me.

Another day dawned in gold through Darla’s windshield. The Sleep crusted in my eyes was blinked away through dry coughs, and gulps of water. I brushed my teeth, stepped onto the side of the road, pissed into the dirt, and was ready to drive again. I had gone north the whole of yesterday, up into the redwoods. Those trees were monolithic things. They might as well be ageless. Towering signposts to the past. They grew taller, and more vibrant than any other tree I have ever seen.

  
  


As I pulled back onto the road, Darla and I had peace again. I went through Jerky, listened to the Radio prattle on about the latest news, the traffic ahead, and the weather to come. Winding through the mountains, I saw car after car parked to admire the wilderness. People walking through Footpaths doing the same thing I am, looking for places in between their responsibilities.

  
  


People come to nature for freedom. They walk through the woods, light campfires, all to forget the places they left. The irony is their homes are no less natural than the woods. People pretend that humans aren’t nature”, but we are. No human building is different from a beaver dam. No cellphone is different than a whale song.

  
Humans make up rules, and gods, and stories to create something that comes out of nothing to save us from our freedom. Without these ideas, people have to face that just like any Lion starving because it can’t catch a gazelle, or any deer eaten by a pack of wolves, nothing comes out of the sky to stop it. Everything on earth is free, we only trick ourselves into thinking we aren’t. When I saw a familiar Black Ford in my rear-view mirror, I was reminded of that reality.

  
  


While I do my best to vanish into the road, The Driver following me might as well have put the sun on my back. His car reeked of timeless demands for attention. Everyone we passed looked. Everyone waved, everyone could tell he was following me. He drove in sync, never too close. He followed me for six hours, I did my best not to panic.

  
  


I told him I was going nowhere. He told me the same. There was nowhere I could stop which he couldn’t stop at too. He stuck through every red light, every turn, every detour. As time passed with the Driver behind me, his presence brought back memories. My brother teaching me to drive, my first car, the first girl I kissed. The first person I left on the side of the road. As the miles of memories piled up, I found myself as the child in my Father’s back seat.

  
  


Even alone with my Darla, I began to hear my parents argue. A memory so vivid I could taste the fear in my mouth. Each curse, each strike, each moment of fear tangible. Alone in the care of two people who knew nothing about care. The dull thud of my Father’s fist on the back of my Mother’s head. I could smell the rain on the road, feel the biting winter through the cracked windshields.

  
  


Beyond my memories rain began to pour. Darla provided a clear windshield, though couldn’t hide the shadow-car behind me. I hit a pothole, and in the noise I heard the cracking thump of my Mother’s face into the hood of my Father’s Volkswagen. The sound of her choking as his hands gripped around her throat.

  
  


Time passed overhead, the gauges on my dashboard and the weight of my eyelids began to beg for peace. The sound of childhood began to ring louder and louder. No matter the music I put on, no matter the places I drove; the Driver’s presence dragged every moment of my life back to me. The blur of tears obscured the road, Darla couldn’t clear my vision. My older brother's voice rang in my head as he held a knife to my Father’s throat.

“Touch her again, and I’ll fucking kill you.” he was 13, I was 9. That was the day I learned how free we really are.

  
  


I pulled off to a rest station. Parking spaces, faded signs, fetid toilets, and rotten showers. It was a crypt for the American Dream, a good place to bury these memories. Dutifully, the Ford pulled in as well. It parked with a modest distance, and the Driver got out. A cigarette in hand, he leaned on his hood and brought smoke to the air around him. I caught my breath as the Driver watched Darla and I.

  
  


Darla was warm, though I needed air to wash out all the dread in me. As I opened the door, the moist cold rushed at me like a bitter hug. The strike of it shook my senses back. I reached out my limbs to bring them back to life, and readied to cut ways with this mystery man. The downpour had started in earnest now, puddles underfoot forming a shallow lake. Even in the shadows, the smoke, and the rain, I could see the Driver’s eyes.

  
  
“Bout time you stopped Tex! Wheew, you weren’t kiddin’ bout nowhere.” He called across the rain.

“I wasn’t.” I said as I called back as I closed the distance between us.

“We bout there yet? Or we getting some sleep before the next stretch?” a dry chuckle cracked through his words.

  
  
“why are you following me?” I asked, I wanted to get through this.

  
  


He smiled.

  
  


“I was waiting’ fer you to ask me that.” his voice put the rattlesnake at my feet again “I wanted to know why *you* were following *me.*” Then his words made the snake bite.

  
  


“You noticed.” I tried to sound sure of myself, though the venom in his words already had me.

  
  


“Hard not to, yer car ain’t exactly subtle.” he nodded towards where I was parked. “How long you been out here?”

  
  


“Long enough to know I like to be left alone.” I replied, as I moved between the Driver and Darla.

  
  


“Well then you ain’t been out long enough, you drive like a stalker.” He tossed his cig, and lit another.

  
  


I wasn’t going to argue, I just wanted him to go away. I had no idea what to say, how to handle this. It was years since I was last in a place like this, years since I left my Mother behind. Left everything behind. I was rusty, before I could say anything, he spoke again.

  
  
“Ya don’t want me to follow ya? Fine, I’ll be on my way. S’just when I noticed you, I felt like you might *need* someone to drive along with.” He offered me a smoke.

  
  


Without thinking I took it. He handed me a lighter, we both smoked in silence for a time. As we did I could feel the turn of the earth under my feet.

  
  


“I appreciate it, and yes sometimes I just need friends on the road.” I finished smoking, threw the butt away, and began to walk back to Darla. “Thanks for the smoke, but I prefer more anonymous company. I’m leavin’. Don’t fuckin’ follow me.”

  
  


“Well Yer welcome Tex! thanks for the miles.” The Driver stood there, His eyes still fixed.

  
  


When I got behind the wheel, I realized why the Driver’s eyes bore through me. Why did his voice put such fear in my veins? I pulled out from the rest stop, and went along to find a better place to sleep. When I think back to the night My Father left, It’s not the screaming, the tears, the threats, or even the rain I remember most. It’s my Father’s eyes. The way he looked at me as I curled into myself in the back seat. The way he looked at me with his eldest son holding a knife to his throat. The way we locked eyes before he walked out into the night. The Driver, with all his mystery, all the smoke, all the miles on his face had those same eyes.

  
  


I got my silence back after a while. I spent time winding through the mountains, looping back into the Redwoods again, and again. Any back road I could find, any isolation from the world I could afford myself. Even in my freedom, the meeting with that man made me feel naked. I’m no longer afraid of the freedom I have. I haven’t been for years. The only thing that scares me, is the freedom other people hold. Nature is fair, you either are or you aren’t. You are safe, or you are not. You are hungry, or you are sated. You are alive, or you are dead.

  
  


The road, for all I talk about the freedom it has, does come with rules. Speed limits, traffic laws, parking restrictions. It’s an extension of Humans nature into Nature. It’s freedom with training wheels. I forget that from time to time. I glorify my disconnection from it all, but I’ve still got Darla. I’ve still got the road. I wanted to shake off the night, to shake off the Driver. So I found a mountain trail made of dirt. I found somewhere more “natural” than “Natural”. The search brought comfort, reassurance.

  
  


In the early house of the night I found myself on the dirt I was hunting for. A shoulder I could rest on. Trees enveloping me away from anything that could chain me to the past. As the rain let up, I was comfortably alone again. Darla kept me safe, old blankets kept me warm. I was eager to get the night behind me, and move on to another place ahead. As I thought of places to get next as everything went blissfully black.

  
  


I don’t know how many hours later, I woke up. A pure still dark mixed with the sound of branches in the wind was everything. I felt confused, it was still night, the stress of everything must have made me sleep like shit. I reached for the wheel, but found nothing. I figured I must’ve just been confused. That’s when I realized I was unexpectedly cold. I began to notice how different the air felt around me. Then I saw it, Darla’s doors were open, and I was yards away on the ground.

  
  


My eyes widened as I began to adjust to the dark. My legs were jelly as I rose to my feet. Fear ate at my stomach as blood rushed through me. Slowly, I walked towards Darla. The Driver and Passenger door were wide open, she was still off. I scrambled to the driver's seat, and shut the doors as fast as I could. I checked the back seat. I locked every door. My heart thundered in my chest, Darla’s engine roared to life to match it. Although before I could drive away, I saw it.

  
  


Darla’s headlights cut the dark ahead of me, and there he was. Between the Redwoods, towering into the night sky, The Driver stood in front of his car. Parked just at the edge of the shoulder, He puffed his cigarette, and smiled.

“Heya Tex.” he said, somehow clear as day.

  
  


I fled from everything. I drove as far, and as fast as I could. I didn’t pay attention to which state I ended up in, I didn’t care about where I was going. All I could do was peer over my shoulder begging for the man in black to not appear.

The room is 3.5x6.7 meters. 

The kitchen counter has bar seating on one side and then a boardgame shelf, so it can't have couches against it. 

The far right has a dartboard and shelves so can't be used as a seating area. 

I want a layout that allows people to sit and talk to each other, and the people on the kitchen, and also allows for a space to play boardgames.  

There's no TV in this room.  

Thanks in advance for any ideas.

Many of you guys seriously need to get educated about how filehosting works in the 1st place. It is a service that cost money to maintain, and I don't see anything wrong with paying to use the service, with a somewhat limited free option, both for technical reasons and respect for the ones who contributed to the project. From my experience with filehosting, at this point one could host po.r.n videos then make a website to stream them and still make more than hosting a free game shop like this


Ah yes there's the occasional metion of the ""good ol' days"" with PixelShop and such. Do you honestly have any ideas why those were closed? Yes they began small like Ghosteshop, with a vow to be absolutely free whatsoever. But those were the times when cloud capabilities were much more than what we need of it, and unlimited Gdrive accounts were very accessible, to the point that I got one for a few dozen bucks. But then came AI and all the sudden the TBs became far too small. Yes it wasn't any DMCA like with emulators it was the change in cloud storage policies, especially from Google itself that killed the old shops. Other filehosting services will only charge more over time, since the need for storage since AI uprising is growing far quicklier than new servers being installed


I am actually glad that Ghosteshop accepts monetary donations for unlimited access, because doing it risks many diruptions to the shop owners real life, and since we're dealing with the big N, even a lawsuit. And the price is very reasonable too, 5.0 a month equals 1 cup of coffee PER MONTH, life time sub equals roughly 3 game cartridges. The old Librashop had pro section too, but only accepts dumped nsp/xci as donations, which while safer, is far more restrictive. The fact that Ghosteshop managed to last for this long and still plans for the future is just impressive, since shop projects rise and fall all the time.


For those who feel 5.0 a month is too much, there's always Ziperto, which is free and convenient minus a shitload of ads in their links (yes that's how they're keeping it free without going bankrupt), the NSW torrent library on Telegram, bunch of other sites. Those plus DBI and you have a perfectly functional way of installing games. What many of you are doing is asking for convenience based off of other's work  and resources, while refusing to pay for it. It's like going into a diner to eat then make the next guy to pay for you. How childish and self-entitled is that?

1m8mfql,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/comments/1m8mfql/where_are_the_thais/,Where are the Thais?,"For context first : I am a foreigner married to a Thai woman. Been living in the north for over 10y and speak a decent Thai.

My wife and I just came back from Samui and while it was very relaxing we found ourselves a little confused on the « workforce » present on the island. 90% of the service workers (barista & servers mostly) were Burmese. Not that their nationality matters in a one-one interaction but I feel it starts to matter in the general perception one has of the country.

For example :
1. We arrive in a coffee shop, ask our order in Thai and the waiters don’t understand a single word (whether from my mouth or my wife’s) first problem then : how do Thai travel in their own country without having to learn English?
2. In one coffee shop, my wife got a bit weirded out at the fact the workers had put a large portait  of Aung San Suu Kyi. (Knowing it has political implications leading to strong conflicts in their own country) 

I want to add that we had Burmese workers in the hotel we stayed in and they were very nice as well as helpful! So please don’t take this as a racial rant nor push this discussion in this direction!

Now my concern is the following : what is Thailand and why people came to visit it for the first time? As a tourist, if you go in such a country and try learning few words in Thai and are greeted by non-Thai not even able to answer you, are you not weirded out? Or as a Thai, do you feel your country still shines the same?  

My goal with this post is to gather people’s opinions on the matter. Please be respectful 🙏",6,1753407403.0,Thailand,98,0.56,False

1. if i have clicked a box outside of the table, go out and come back it wont do it

2. only selects tables - i have charts and a table in one sheet and it will only select the table. 

  
it only started doing this today in the middle of editing so i know i accidentally did something, maybe it has something to do with countif vs content tracker? I was making a table trying to extract data from sheet A onto a table in sheet b and switched back and forth from countif and content tracker so maybe that can have an effect? however i did switch back to the original formula and then also deleted it entirely and it still does this. 

I have tried online suggestion like turning off alternating colors, and creating a conditioning formula`=iseven(row())`.but it did not work

  
I have attached some pictures of how it is selecting and the ""counts"" from the bottom right that are on some pages but not others cause i thought maybe that is what is causing this?

its weird that it does this for every table when only one has charts and table. 

PLEASE HELP, I have no idea whats going on!

This happened two days in a row. Typically, I prepare to go to work after breakfast, look at the clock, realise that the bus is in 30-40 minutes, decide to relax a little before going to the bus stop which is right next to my house, maybe play an audiobook in the meantime as I sit on a chair comfortably, and before I realise, I fall asleep, usually for an hour. 

I don't drink coffee in the morning, blood reports are fine without iron deficiency etc. Breakfast is usually bread & a protein source.

Fyi, I'm on a fairly later stage of a trauma recovery session where I'm re-exposuring myself to triggers. I sustain myself well before them overall but there's this particular issue which is making me late to go to work.

Let’s not sugarcoat it: Windows laptops in 2025 are an embarrassment — and somehow, the entire tech industry is acting like that’s normal.

There was a time when Windows laptops were the obvious choice: cheaper, more powerful, endlessly customizable. But today? You’re paying more money for machines that are:

Heavier

Hotter

Louder

And practically useless once you unplug them

Let’s talk specifics:

 Battery life?
A total joke. You’re lucky to get 4–6 hours of basic use. Heaven forbid you open Chrome, launch Teams, or — God help you — try to game on battery.

 Chargers?
Still those absurd 100W+ power bricks. Carrying one feels like bringing your own power plant to the coffee shop.

 Thermals?
Throttling galore. Fans that spin like jet engines. Laptop chassis so hot you could fry an egg. This isn’t performance — it’s a space heater with a keyboard.

 Gaming?
Used to be the last stronghold. But guess what? MacBooks with M3/M4 chips are quietly eating that too. Between Game Porting Toolkit, Crossover, and Steam, Apple Silicon is now running more and more Windows games — and doing it quietly, coolly, and efficiently.

 Performance on battery?
Nonexistent. Unplug a Windows laptop and watch performance collapse. Meanwhile, a fanless MacBook Air M4 runs full tilt for 15+ hours, without breaking a sweat.


---

And while all this is happening… tech reviewers are tossing out 8/10s and calling it a day. No mention of the 10-pound charger. No mention of how Windows laptops become Chromebooks when unplugged. Just the same tired “but it has a 4070” cop-out.

Meanwhile, Apple drops a MacBook Air M4 with:

16GB unified memory

Real-world 15–18 hour battery life

Full performance, even on battery

Fanless design

$850 sale price

Runs most productivity AND creative software better

And yes — it plays games now too

And it weighs less than the Windows charger.


---

So seriously — who are Windows laptops even for in 2025?

If you're locked into legacy enterprise tools or need to run niche Windows apps, sure. But if you’re “just a gamer,” why are you on a laptop in the first place? And if you’re doing literally anything else, the MacBook Air demolishes it on value, performance, and usability.


---

Windows laptops aren’t just losing. They’ve already lost.

Lost the performance crown

Lost the battery war

Losing the gaming war

And lost the value argument a long time ago

But sure, let’s keep pretending this is fine — and keep handing out review scores like it’s 2015.
