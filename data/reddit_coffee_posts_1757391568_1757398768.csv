We also have an 18month and 2 dogs. 

We took her in because I knew her from my previous marriage when we were stationed at the same base. I've since remarried. At the time she was fine and wasn't all over the place. When I found out she came back to our home state and was nearby, my husband and I offered to house her for the time being. 

She doordashes but doesn't have an actual job lined up or home. She had things originally in place but they fell through. She's been with us over 2 weeks and hasn't said anything about finding a stable job. She's going through a divorce, her soon to be ex husband has the 3 kids in his care until she can figure out a livable place. She doordashes nearly every day, her ex pays her around $200 a week for expenses and she does receive food stamps. We haven't asked for anything back but she's bought us meals and coffee with what she can. She's already had to pay for new tires which were over $400 and her vehicle is about $50 to fill up. 

I'm starting to lose patience with her. She got angry with me today when I asked her what her plans were for the future. Yesterday she was pulled over by a cop for tags that have been expired for a year. She's been able to get away with it because she comes from a smaller town and drove up to our city to live with us. The cop was kind enough to not tow her vehicle nor did he give her a ticket. I didn't know her tags were expired for so long and my husband said that she should be beyond grateful. Well, I don't think she quite understood how the city cops here can be major aholes, and that she dodged a nearly $800+ bill. 

Well, we've been dropping hints to apply to jobs and ask her ""guy friends"" if they're hiring at their jobs or knows anyone who could get her in. A friend said to contact someone in HR at a factory that she knows and has yet to do it. We asked about her resume and my friend said another friend was helping her with it but hadn't reached out in awhile because that friend was sick with the flu. 

We told her she needs a proper W2 job as her doordash job won't let her get into any apartments. We've given her resources and names to reach out to for home and job opportunities and she hasn't made any moves to contact them. We were pushing so hard because apartment rates are dropping for a 1-2 bdrm. She's not understanding when we tell her she needs to show to her and her ex's lawyers that she has a place for her children to come and spend the night at and that she has a stable income. My husband and I have been through our own divorces and this is her 1st. We told her the better it looks on her the better the divorce will go through. She's insisting that the divorce is just fine and dandy because her soon to be ex is playing nice ""for now"".

I'm unsure on how to tell her to stop talking to these men she finds online and to actually put herself in a ""stable"" position. I also don't want to hold her hand when she's 32 and we've already given her names and resources to contact. We've even looked at jobs for her and still she has yet to make any moves. What my husband has noticed is that she does bring in a bunch of alcohol into our apartment nearly every time she runs out. She drinks a beer a day, or will chug wine from the bottle, but she hasn't gotten mean or violent. Hardly tipsy from what we've noticed. 

How do we tell her to get her act together and how do we kindly tell her to pack up and leave if she's not showing effort?",1,1757398621.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1ncbd3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_External_Engineer840/comments/1ncbd3a/benefits_of_butter_in_coffee/,Benefits of Butter in Coffee,"# 

Adding butter to coffee may sound unconventional, but this trend has gained popularity for good reason. Incorporating healthy fats into your morning cup can enhance energy levels, support focus, and even promote weight management. The benefits of butter in coffee go beyond taste, offering both physical and mental advantages when consumed thoughtfully as part of a balanced lifestyle.

# A Natural Energy Booster

One of the primary benefits of butter in coffee is sustained energy. Unlike sugar or high-carbohydrate breakfasts that cause quick spikes and crashes, butter provides a steady source of fuel. The healthy fats slow down digestion and allow caffeine to be absorbed gradually, leading to longer-lasting alertness without the jitters. This makes it an excellent choice for busy mornings when you need to stay sharp and productive.

# Enhances Mental Focus and Clarity

Healthy fats, particularly those found in grass-fed butter, are rich in compounds that support brain health. When paired with coffee, these fats work synergistically with caffeine to improve concentration and cognitive performance. Many people report feeling less distracted and more ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù after switching to this combination. The steady energy release also helps reduce the midday slump that often comes from sugary breakfasts or carb-heavy snacks.

# Supports Weight Management Goals

Another notable benefit of butter in coffee is its potential role in weight management. Healthy fats help promote satiety, which means you‚Äôre less likely to experience mid-morning hunger pangs or reach for processed snacks. Additionally, when consumed as part of a low-carb or ketogenic lifestyle, butter in coffee encourages the body to use fat as a primary energy source, helping maintain a fat-burning state throughout the day.

# Rich in Essential Nutrients

Butter, particularly from grass-fed sources, provides essential fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, and K. These nutrients play important roles in supporting immunity, bone health, and skin vitality. Including butter in your coffee can be an easy way to increase your intake of these vitamins, especially for individuals following low-carb diets where other sources may be limited.

# Improves Gut Health and Digestion

Healthy fats can also have a positive effect on digestion and gut health. By slowing the absorption of caffeine, butter reduces the risk of stomach irritation that some people experience when drinking coffee on an empty stomach. The combination can feel smoother and less acidic, making it easier for sensitive digestive systems to handle.

# Promotes a Satisfying Morning Ritual

Beyond its physical benefits, adding butter to coffee creates a richer, creamier texture and a naturally indulgent flavor. For many, this morning ritual becomes more enjoyable and helps set a positive tone for the day. It transforms a simple cup of coffee into a satisfying, nutrient-packed beverage that feels more like a treat than a necessity.

# Helps Maintain Stable Blood Sugar Levels

Unlike sugary creamers or sweetened lattes, butter in coffee contains virtually no carbohydrates, which means it won‚Äôt spike your blood sugar levels. Stable blood sugar is essential for consistent energy, balanced mood, and reduced cravings throughout the day. For individuals managing insulin sensitivity or following specific diets, this can be an effective alternative to traditional coffee add-ins.

# Can Complement Intermittent Fasting

For those practicing intermittent fasting, one of the surprising benefits of butter in coffee is its compatibility with fasting protocols. Since butter is composed primarily of fat, it doesn‚Äôt significantly affect insulin levels, allowing you to maintain your fasted state while still providing your body with energy and mental clarity during fasting windows.

# Encourages Healthy Fat Consumption

Healthy fats are an essential part of a balanced diet, yet many people don‚Äôt consume enough of them. Adding butter to coffee is an easy, convenient way to increase your intake of beneficial fats without adding extra meal prep. These fats not only fuel your body but also play a role in hormone regulation, nutrient absorption, and overall cellular health.

# Conclusion

The benefits of butter in coffee extend far beyond its creamy taste. From boosting energy and mental focus to supporting weight management and providing essential nutrients, this simple addition can transform your morning routine. While it may not be for everyone, those who incorporate butter into their coffee often find it helps them feel more satisfied, energized, and focused throughout the day. As with any dietary change, balance is key ‚Äî but if you‚Äôre looking for a natural way to elevate your mornings, butter in coffee could be worth exploring.

Some background: I've used Nespresso for years simple because it's affordable and easy to maintain, but the espressos have always been too watery (even with strong flavours and minimal water settings). I make iced lattes a lot, and it sucks when half the cup is filled with 3 shots of espressos that taste like 1 shot from a Costa or Starbucks (even while using Costa / Starbucks pods). This is the same across 4 machines I tested including the expensive Creatista Plus.

My point being, I think what I'm looking for is in an espresso machine since from what I know it lets you control the volume and intensity?

But my questions begin here:

* People say the grinder is more important than the machine, but why? And is this relevant for my goal? It apparently brings out richer flavour, but I cant tell if this is a 'nice to have' or if it's directly what I want i.e. stronger shots. And does this mean I can just opt for a ¬£80 Amazon espresso machine as long as I invest in a good grinder?
* What do I get out of more expensive machines exactly? Are there specific features I should be looking for to allow me to manually make espressos at the exact volume and intensity? Or do all machines do this anyway and price just improves nice-to-have features?

I'd love some guidance so thank you. Again, my goal is in the TLDR at the top of this post, and nothing more. I want to just put in some ground beans and set the water to minimum and get strong flavoured coffee.

I stated a budget of ¬£200 though the cheaper the better. This post is more about advice I suppose but feel free to recommend machines too, I usually look at Amazon (UK), John Lewis, Argos, etc.",1,1757398478.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

He lives in Pampanga and I'm in Manila. Then, we developed feelings for each other and became together. The relationship was so toxic and very immature that time, so we ended up separating ways.

Then, we met for the second time around after a couple of years din. He's still in Pampanga and I'm in Antipolo. However, I was seeing someone that time, but he's physically violent and I plan to end things with the person na rin. We talked and we just knew na we were ready to choose each other and be in each other's arms again that time. However, something bad happened to me and I had to take a break from everything around me to get therapy and recover from trauma. I ended up leaving him with no clues at all as to what happened.

Now, we met again after a couple of years, but we were able to meet each other in flesh this time around since we are both in Pampanga. We clarifed all the unresolved questions about us and our fallouts. He shared na he's in a relationship now. He was having second thoughts at first if both of us should meet, but we ended up doing it. So, we went out and the plan was to just talk while having coffee from 1 PM to 4 PM since he got a class around 5:30 PM. But, we ended breaking the plan. We went to Angeles to have some early dinner and just stayed in SM Clark until his class finishes around 7:30 PM. We broke all of his rules, such as no giving of gifts, KKB, and hiwalay na mag-order, and they were made for us to aware of the boundaries.

When we got home, both of us started crying. We went to all of our frustations and how much we want to keep each other exisiting in our lives. We just wanted for time to be longer and we won't feel conflicted of what we're doing.

*Dear Esteemed Members of the Anorexic Aesthetic Appreciation Society (AAAS),*

*As the honorable Mayor of Skinnyville, USA, I am thrilled to extend my heartfelt congratulations and a standing ovation (well, more like a wobbly lean, given the vibe) to your community for pioneering true diversity in body representation. In a world obsessed with curves, cushions, and those pesky things called ""muscles,"" you've boldly stepped forward‚Äîor should I say, shuffled forward on your elegant, nutrient-free frames‚Äîto champion the underrepresented: the starving children of Africa!*

*Yes, you heard that right. By aspiring to that flawless, hollow-eyed, rib-cage-on-display look, you're not just chasing personal goals‚Äîyou're bringing global awareness to famines worldwide. Who needs charity galas or those annoying ""feed the children"" ads when we have YOU, the walking, talking billboards for nutrient deficiency? Your dedication to minimalism inspires us all. Why eat when you can embody the Sahara's vibe? You've diversified our streets with that authentic ""third-world chic"" aesthetic‚Äînow every time I see one of you gracefully collapsing in a faint, I think, ""Ah, representation!"" Keep starving the haters, folks. You're not just thin; you're philanthropically translucent!*

*Skeleton solidarity forever,*

*P.S. Enclosed is a coupon for 10% off invisible meals at your local air buffet.*

**Part 2: The Spooky Family Outing Skit (With 100% More Clanking)**

*Scene: A foggy park at dusk. The wind howls. Suddenly‚ÄîCLANK CLANK CLANK! Like a bunch of wind chimes made from rusty coat hangers. A wide-eyed kid tugs on his dad's sleeve.*

**Kid:** ""Dad! Dad! Listen to that! It's like real skeletons are coming to life! Are we in a horror movie?!""

**Dad:** (sipping his coffee, unfazed) ""Nah, son. That's just the annual r/anorexia meetup. See those folks over there? They're not undead‚Äîthey're just really committed to the 'no carbs, no problems' lifestyle. Watch 'em clank around like a xylophone orchestra. Last year, one tripped and played the entire 'Spooky Scary Skeletons' remix just by falling down. Diversity in motion, kiddo!""

**Kid:** ""Whoa, can I join? I wanna be a walking maraca too!""

**Dad:** ""Eat your veggies first, or you'll end up like them‚Äîtoo light to cast a shadow.""

*(Cut to the meetup: A group of skeletons high-fiving with audible cracks. One yells, ""Bone app the teeth!"" Fade to black with more clanking.)*

**Part 3: The Nutrient Roast (Sahara Edition, But Leveled Up for Maximum LOLs)**

Yo, anorexic squad, y'all are so malnourished, even the Sahara Desert is jealous of your nutrient levels‚Äîcuz at least the Sahara has sand, which is basically just ground-up rocks with more vitamins than your entire meal plan! Nah, for real: You're so dedicated to that skeleton glow-up, if you stood in a vitamin store, the supplements would run away screaming, ""Nope, too much commitment here!"" Your body's like a barren wasteland where calories go to die‚Äîscientists are studying you to solve world hunger, cuz one look and everyone's appetite vanishes. ""How do you stay so thin?"" they ask.

Designer: ""This season's look: Eternal Halloween. Accessories? Just your visible spine. Who needs fabric when your ribs are the pattern?""

- **Gym Bro vs. Skeleton Bro:** Gym bros lift weights to get swole. Anorexic bros lift... nothing, cuz they're already lighter than air. ""Bro, what's your max bench?"" ""My max? I benched a feather once and pulled a muscle. Gains? Nah, losses only‚Äîlost 10 pounds just thinking about food!""

- **Dating App Disaster:** Tinder bio: ""Seeking someone who appreciates the finer things, like my collarbones popping like champagne corks. Swipe right if you like your dates transparent‚Äîliterally, you can see through me to the other side. Bonus: I never hog the blankets cuz I generate zero body heat!""

- **Halloween Hack:** Why do anorexic peeps dominate Halloween? Cuz they don't need costumes‚Äîthey just show up as themselves and win ""Best Skeleton"" every time. ""Trick or treat? Nah, just tricks‚Äîtreating myself would ruin the aesthetic. Pass the candy? I'll pass out instead!""

- **Superhero Origin Story:** If anorexic folks were superheroes, their power would be ""Invisibility in a Crowd"" cuz they're so thin, they slip between raindrops. Villain: ""You can't stop me!"" Hero: ""Wanna bet? I'll just starve your evil plans until they wither away like my waistline!""

- **Food Court Fiasco:** At the mall food court: ""I'll have the salad... hold the lettuce, dressing, croutons, and bowl. Actually, just bring me the menu‚ÄîI eat with my eyes only."" Cashier: ""That'll be $0.00. Enjoy your... air?""

- **Evolution Meme:** Darwin looking at anorexic evolution: ""Survival of the fittest? More like survival of the thinnest.

1ncb2sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/livingfromtheend/comments/1ncb2sb/why_living_like_youre_already_loved_pulls_love_in/,Why Living Like You‚Äôre Already Loved Pulls Love In,"When most people are asked what they truly want to manifest, the answer often comes down to one thing: **love**. A deep, lasting romantic love that transforms ordinary days into extraordinary moments. But love isn‚Äôt just luck, fate, or chance it can be consciously created.

Manifesting love is not about waiting for stars to align. It‚Äôs about **using imagination, emotions, and inner alignment** to call love into reality. Here‚Äôs how the process works and what to keep in mind:

**1. Love is a Creation, Not a Coincidence**

Love doesn‚Äôt ‚Äújust happen‚Äù randomly. Every relationship that forms is a reflection of energy, choices, and beliefs. When you begin to see love as something you actively co-create, you reclaim power.

* Every thought is like a brushstroke painting your love life.
* Every emotion is a vibration that calls matching experiences into your world.
* Every inner belief quietly decides what kind of people enter your orbit.

When you create love consciously, you don‚Äôt wait for fate you **become a magnet for the love you‚Äôre aligned with**.

**2. Imagination & Feelings: The Core Tools**

Imagination is not child‚Äôs play. It is the workshop of creation. Feelings are not just moods they are the signals that shape reality.

* **Imagination** is where you plant seeds. When you imagine cuddling with someone, celebrating anniversaries, or laughing over coffee, you are shaping an inner reality.
* **Feelings** water those seeds. Without emotion, imagination stays flat. With emotion, it breathes life into your vision.

The more vividly you feel those experiences *now*, the faster they begin to show up outside you. It‚Äôs not fantasy; it‚Äôs rehearsal for reality.

**3. Becoming Love, Not Chasing It**

Chasing love implies lack. Becoming love creates abundance.

* Embody qualities of the partner you want to attract: kindness, patience, presence.
* Instead of begging the universe for love, **set the table for two** (literally and energetically).
* Release desperation because desperation repels. A calm, open heart pulls love in.

When you *become* love itself, the right partner naturally finds you because you‚Äôre vibrating at the frequency of the love you desire.

**4. Relationships as Mirrors**

Relationships reflect what you believe about yourself. If your inner world holds fear, doubt, or unworthiness, your outer world will mirror it.

* If you attract unavailable people, it may be reflecting your own fear of vulnerability.
* If you feel disrespected in love, it may reflect how you treat yourself internally.

Healing begins with self-honesty. Ask: *‚ÄúWhat is this relationship teaching me about my own beliefs?‚Äù* When you adjust your inner relationship with yourself, the mirror outside changes too.

**5. Crafting a Vision of Love**

Without clarity, love gets vague. The universe responds better when you‚Äôre clear about what you desire.

* Write down qualities you want in a partner: loyalty, playfulness, ambition, emotional depth.
* Identify your non-negotiables (respect, honesty, commitment).
* Leave room for surprises. Don‚Äôt lock the universe into one rigid form; allow it to send someone even *better than your list*.

Your vision acts like a compass guiding you toward alignment while openness keeps you receptive.

**6. The Trap of Specific People**

It‚Äôs natural to want ‚Äúthat one person.‚Äù But obsession creates resistance.

* Focusing on one person often leads to attachment, fear of loss, and pedestal energy.
* Manifestation works best when you focus on the **qualities and essence** of the love you desire, not just a single face.
* Trust that the right person aligned with your vision will show up. And often, they‚Äôll surpass your expectations.

This doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt attract a specific person. It means love flows easier when you release the tight grip and allow the best aligned partner to arrive. Even the same specific person.

**7. Healing Emotional Roadblocks**

Unhealed wounds create walls around the heart. To manifest love, those walls need softening.

* Look at patterns: Do you keep ending up in similar heartbreaks? That‚Äôs your subconscious replaying old beliefs.
* Heal by revising your story: replace ‚Äúlove always hurts me‚Äù with ‚Äúlove supports me, grows me, and feels safe.‚Äù
* Forgive the past. Not to excuse others, but to free yourself from carrying that pain forward.

Healing doesn‚Äôt mean being ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù It means being open to love without dragging old chains into new relationships.

**8. Balancing Desire & Detachment**

Desire is powerful it sets intention. But clinging strangles the process.

* Desire is the spark. It tells the universe: *‚ÄúThis is what I choose.‚Äù*
* Detachment is trust. It says: *‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs coming. I don‚Äôt need to obsess.‚Äù*

Think of it like planting a seed. You wouldn‚Äôt dig it up every day to check if it‚Äôs growing. You water it (desire) and trust nature (detachment). That‚Äôs how love blooms.

**9. Building Self-Love & Confidence**

Self-love is not a clich√©, it‚Äôs the foundation.

* When you love yourself, you radiate worthiness. That energy attracts partners who see and treat you as valuable.
* Daily practice: affirmations, small acts of kindness toward yourself, setting boundaries.
* Confidence doesn‚Äôt come from looks, money, or external validation. It comes from knowing you‚Äôre whole, even before love arrives.

When you glow with self-love, you become naturally magnetic.

**10. Living in the End**

One of Neville Goddard‚Äôs most powerful teachings: live as though the wish is fulfilled.

* Ask yourself: *‚ÄúIf I already had my ideal partner, how would I feel today?‚Äù* Then practice that feeling.
* Journal as though you‚Äôre already living your love story.
* Create space physically (like a side of the bed free for your partner) and emotionally (release bitterness, open to joy).

Living in the end collapses time between ‚Äúdesire‚Äù and ‚Äúreality.‚Äù You stop waiting for love, and instead **live in love now** which magnetizes the relationship faster.

**11. Ethics of Manifesting Love**

True love respects free will. Trying to manipulate or force someone into love is not alignment, it‚Äôs control. And control never creates genuine love.

* Manifest the **qualities and energy** of the relationship you want, not the forced obedience of a specific person.
* Authentic love happens when two aligned souls meet, both freely choosing each other.
* When you manifest ethically, the relationship lasts because it‚Äôs rooted in truth, not manipulation.

**The Key Takeaway**  
  
Love is not something to chase. It is something to embody. By cultivating self-love, healing past wounds, aligning with the qualities of love desired, and living as though it‚Äôs already here, the reflection of that energy appears naturally in life.

Love is not outside waiting to be found. **Love begins within** and when that inner state blossoms, the right partner and relationship flow effortlessly into reality. ",1,1757397493.0,livingfromtheend,0,1.0,False

Shortened version of my post - 

I‚Äôm a nanny employer (mom) and our nanny started a few weeks ago. Overall, I think she‚Äôs fairly decent - she is sweet with my 4 month old daughter and follows instructions. My daughter has some feeding challenges and needs to be bottle fed while drowsy or distracted - and she‚Äôs been helpful there without complaints. Other than the feeding though our babe is a very chill and happy little girl. The nanny isn‚Äôt super proactive but I‚Äôm fine with that since she follows my instructions well. She‚Äôs on the younger side and has no children herself. 

My main issue with her is that during my daughter‚Äôs wake windows, our nanny will occasionally be on her phone when my daughter is doing tummy time, or if she‚Äôs holding my daughter and having her look at herself in our mirror, etc. It‚Äôs not the entire time, but it will be for a few minutes here and there periodically throughout the entire time my daughter is awake. For example, she‚Äôll spend 5-10 minutes engaged with the baby singing songs, reading a book, etc. Then she‚Äôll plop her down and sit next to her and be scrolling on her phone or texting for 5-10 minutes. Then the cycle will repeat. Sometimes I‚Äôve caught my daughter looking at her phone screen (she‚Äôll do it when she‚Äôs holding the baby too) when she‚Äôs scrolling. 

I‚Äôm all for people needing breaks, but my daughter literally naps for 3-4 hours out of the 8 hours she‚Äôs here - during nap time, nanny is on her phone 90% of the time (after doing some light housework that was agreed upon in our contract). I have no issue with phone usage during nap time at all - but my question is - is it unreasonable of me to ask her to limit phone usage to only playing music or for emergencies during my daughter‚Äôs brief wake windows (1-1.5 hours at a time)? 

If not unreasonable, how can I best bring up the convo? We have a contract but didn‚Äôt specify phone usage in it honestly because I‚Äôve never had this issue with other nannies before‚Ä¶I genuinely didn‚Äôt even think to mention it. I know the younger generations these days are addicted to their phones (I can be too!!) so I‚Äôm worried that she‚Äôll just hate her job if she can‚Äôt use her phone at all while my daughter is awake/for those 1-2 hour stretches. I know it can get boring playing with a 4 month old but I‚Äôm also really concerned about when my girl is older and the nanny starts taking her to parks etc., when our babe is walking I expect 100% undivided attention on her if not inside our home. It just seems like a safety issue at that point and I have so much anxiety about it if phone usage is already so frequent just a few weeks in. 

Will I piss her off by requesting this of her? If this was you or has been you in the past, how have you appreciated your employer bringing the convo up? Am I overreacting? 

For additional context, we hired her to be a full time nanny with at least a one year commitment. We pay a generous rate ($5K+ per month), offer 2 week paid vacation, 5 paid sick days, and paid holidays. I believe I‚Äôm a kind employer - I work from home and have made her lunch if I see she didn‚Äôt bring any. I‚Äôve brought her Starbucks if I get myself some. She uses my husband‚Äôs coffee machine every morning. I‚Äôve told her she‚Äôs welcome to anything in our pantry as well. 

Please help - I need to decide if I have to let her go and find someone else, or if this is salvageable and worth working on! ",1,1757397271.0,Nanny,4,0.67,False

# How I Saved $15,000 Per Year with These Free AI Tools üí∞

Last month I was paying $1,250 per month for translation services, presentation design, and video production.

Today I'm paying $0.

Three Chinese AI tools just replaced my entire creative workflow. And they work better than the expensive alternatives.

While everyone obsesses over Grok 5 AI announcements, smart entrepreneurs are already cutting costs and improving quality with tools available right now.

Hunyuan MT7B replaces Google Translate and human translators. Kimi Slides eliminates PowerPoint and design agencies. Hunyuan Video Foley removes the need for audio engineers.

The best part? They're all free and open source while you wait for Grok 5 AI development to finish.

# Step-by-Step: Replacing Google Translate with Hunyuan MT7B üåç

Hunyuan MT7B just crushed Google Translate at the world's biggest translation competition. Won 30 out of 31 language pairs.

This tiny 7 billion parameter model beats systems with 10 times more parameters.

Here's exactly how to implement Hunyuan MT7B in your business:

**Technical Setup:** Install Python and the Transformers library. Download the model from HuggingFace. Configure for your preferred languages.

**Basic Usage:** Input text in source language. Specify target language. Get professional-quality translation in seconds.

**Business Integration:** Create translation workflows for customer communications, content localization, and international marketing.

**Cost Comparison:** Professional translators charge $100-$300 per 1,000 words. Hunyuan MT7B costs maybe $50 monthly for unlimited translations.

**Quality Testing:** I tested technical documentation, marketing copy, and customer emails. Hunyuan MT7B consistently outperformed Google Translate and matched human translator quality.

The context understanding is incredible. Where Google gives literal translations, Hunyuan MT7B understands cultural meaning and provides accurate interpretations.

# Converting PowerPoint Users to Kimi Slides in 3 Steps üìä

Moonshot AI's Kimi Slides creates presentations in under 60 seconds that look like premium design agencies made them.

I tested this on real client work. The results shocked everyone including the clients.

**Step 1: Access Setup** \- Visit Kimi website, click Kimi Plus, select PPT assistant. No downloads required.

**Step 2: Content Input** \- Type your topic, upload existing documents, or provide website URLs. The AI researches and creates comprehensive presentations automatically.

**Step 3: Quality Review** \- Generated presentations include professional themes, relevant imagery, and logical flow. Make minor adjustments if needed.

**Real Results:** Last week I created a client pitch presentation in 30 minutes that normally takes 4 hours. Client asked who designed it. They thought I hired a professional agency.

We closed a six-figure deal using that presentation.

The time savings translate directly to profit. If you charge $200 per hour and save 3.5 hours per presentation, that's $700 in value every time.

# Audio Production Workflow with Hunyuan Video Foley üéµ

Every AI video has been silent until now. Hunyuan Video Foley just solved the biggest problem in AI content creation.

Take any video. Add a text description. Get professional movie-level audio in 10 seconds.

**Implementation Process:** Clone the repository from GitHub. Install dependencies. Download model weights. Set up local or cloud deployment.

**Hardware Requirements:** GPU with 20GB+ RAM. RTX 3090 or 4090 works perfectly. Cloud deployment available if you lack hardware.

**Workflow Integration:** Upload video files. Write descriptive prompts. Generate audio. Review and adjust if needed. Export final videos with professional sound.

**Business Applications:** Content creation, marketing videos, training materials, product demonstrations, social media content.

**Quality Comparison:** I tested against expensive audio production services. Hunyuan Video Foley matched professional quality at zero ongoing cost.

The system creates layered soundscapes that sync perfectly with visual timing. Coffee pouring sounds, nature ambiance, technical equipment noise - everything sounds authentic.

# Why This Matters More Than Grok 5 AI Hype üèÜ

While everyone talks about Grok 5 AI promises, these Chinese tools deliver results today.

Grok 5 AI development continues with uncertain timelines. These tools work right now and solve real business problems.

The competitive advantage goes to businesses that implement available solutions instead of waiting for perfect ones.

By the time Grok 5 AI launches, you'll already have optimized AI workflows. Your competitors will be starting from zero.

This pattern repeats with every technology wave. Early adopters get massive advantages. Late adopters struggle to catch up.

# Implementation Roadmap for Maximum Business Impact üéØ

Don't try to implement everything at once. Follow this proven roadmap:

**Week 1-2:** Set up Hunyuan MT7B. Test with non-critical translation tasks. Build confidence and workflows.

**Week 3-4:** Implement Kimi Slides for internal presentations. Train team members. Establish quality standards.

**Week 5-6:** Deploy Hunyuan Video Foley for content creation. Start with simple projects. Expand complexity gradually.

**Week 7-8:** Integrate all tools into daily workflows. Measure time savings and quality improvements. Document best practices.

**Month 2:** Optimize usage patterns. Train additional team members. Calculate ROI and cost savings.

**Month 3+:** Scale usage across entire organization. Explore advanced features. Consider custom integrations.

This gradual approach prevents implementation chaos and ensures successful adoption.

# Quality Control Systems That Actually Work ‚ö°

Free tools require extra attention to quality control. Here's how to maintain standards:

**Translation Quality:** Always review important communications. Use native speakers for critical content. Build terminology databases for consistency.

**Presentation Standards:** Create brand guidelines for AI-generated presentations. Review client-facing materials. Maintain style consistency.

**Audio Verification:** Test audio on different devices. Check synchronization carefully. Have backup plans for technical failures.

**Process Documentation:** Record what works and what doesn't. Build checklists for common tasks. Train team members properly.

**Continuous Improvement:** Gather feedback regularly. Update processes based on results. Stay current with tool updates.

Quality control separates professional implementation from amateur usage.

# Scaling Strategy for Growing Businesses üìä

As your business grows, these AI tools scale with you:

**Small Team (1-5 people):** Use basic implementations. Focus on time savings and cost reduction.

**Medium Team (6-20 people):** Develop specialized workflows. Train power users. Create internal documentation.

**Large Team (20+ people):** Build custom integrations. Establish centers of excellence. Measure ROI systematically.

**Enterprise Level:** Consider on-premise deployments. Develop custom features. Integrate with existing systems.

The open source nature means you can customize these tools for your specific needs without vendor lock-in.

# Common Implementation Mistakes to Avoid üö´

Based on working with hundreds of businesses, here are the biggest mistakes:

**Mistake 1:** Trying to implement everything immediately. Start with one tool and master it.

**Mistake 2:** Ignoring quality control. Free doesn't mean unmanaged.

**Mistake 3:** Not training team members. Tools are only as good as the people using them.

**Mistake 4:** Expecting perfection immediately. AI tools improve with proper usage and feedback.

**Mistake 5:** Not measuring results. Track time savings, cost reductions, and quality improvements.

**Mistake 6:** Resistance to change. Some team members need extra support during transitions.

Learn from others' mistakes instead of making them yourself.

# Building Competitive Advantages While Others Wait üèÅ

Your competitors are probably ignoring these tools or waiting for ""better"" solutions.

This gives you a massive opportunity.

While they pay premium prices for basic services, you deliver better results at lower costs.

While they wait weeks for external providers, you create professional content in minutes.

While they struggle with language barriers, you communicate globally without translation delays.

These advantages compound over time. Small daily improvements create massive long-term differences.

# ROI Measurement Framework for AI Tool Implementation üìã

Track these metrics to prove business value:

**Time Metrics:** Hours saved per task. Faster project completion. Reduced waiting times for external services.

**Cost Metrics:** Monthly subscription savings. Reduced vendor expenses. Lower labor costs for routine tasks.

**Quality Metrics:** Client satisfaction scores. Error reduction rates. Professional appearance improvements.

**Revenue Metrics:** Faster sales cycles. More client projects. International market expansion.

**Productivity Metrics:** Tasks completed per day. Team member efficiency. Automation adoption rates.

Document everything. AI tool implementation creates measurable business improvements when done correctly.

# Getting Started Today (Even with Zero Technical Skills) üöÄ

You don't need to be technical to benefit from these tools:

**Option 1:** Use cloud-based versions when available. Many tools offer web interfaces.

**Option 2:** Partner with technical team members. Focus on business applications while they handle setup.

**Option 3:** Hire implementation consultants. One-time setup cost pays for itself quickly.

**Option 4:** Join communities of users. Learn from others who've solved similar challenges.

**Option 5:** Start with simpler tools first. Build confidence before tackling complex implementations.

The key is starting, not waiting for perfect conditions.

1ncaz5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/n8nforbeginners/comments/1ncaz5r/my_aha_moment_i_finally_understood_n8ns_invisible/,My 'Aha!' Moment: I Finally Understood n8n's 'Invisible Loop' By Automating a Simple Report,"Every Monday morning used to start with a sigh. Before my coffee had even kicked in, I had to open our weekly feedback form, open a Google Sheet, and spend 20 soul-crushing minutes copying and pasting every single submission from one to the other. It was the definition of a task that makes you question your life choices.

One day, I'd had enough. ""This is what n8n is for!"" I told myself. It seemed simple: a form trigger, and a Google Sheets node. But then I tried to get clever. I wanted to check each submission for a low rating and, if it was negative, send an alert to Slack immediately. 

And that's where I hit a wall. A massive, frustrating, concrete wall.

My brain, conditioned by programming, screamed ""You need a loop!"" I had a list of items (the form submissions), and I needed to do something with *each* of them. So I searched and found the 'Loop Over Items' node. I stuck it in my workflow and... chaos. Everything broke. I was getting weird nested data, my IF node was only seeing the *last* item, and I felt like a complete idiot. This was supposed to be a beginner-level task, and I was failing spectacularly.

I spent an embarrassing amount of time on this. A few hours one evening, another hour the next day. I was getting genuinely annoyed, mostly at myself. I was making it way too complicated.

In a fit of frustration, I deleted the Loop node. I just connected my Form Trigger -> IF Node -> Google Sheets Node. I figured I'd at least get the copy-paste part working. I submitted three test entries to my form: one good, one bad, one okay. I went back to n8n and clicked 'Execute Workflow'.

And then I saw it. 

The little `[3]` that appeared over the trigger node. Then a `[3]` over the IF node. Then a `[1]` on the 'true' output of the IF and a `[2]` on the 'false' output. It was processing all three items separately, automatically.

My jaw literally dropped. It was the 'aha!' moment I'd been desperately needing. **n8n doesn't need a loop node for this because the entire workflow *is* the loop.** It takes every single item it receives from the trigger and runs it down the chain, one by one. The 'invisible loop' I was searching for was the very nature of how n8n works.

It felt like I'd been trying to put a hat on a man who was already wearing a hat. 

The final workflow was so beautifully simple:

1.  **Tally Form Trigger:** Fires whenever a new submission comes in.
2.  **IF Node:** Checks the rating. My condition is simple: `{{ $json.body.fields[2].value }} < 3`. (Yours might be different depending on your form).
3.  **True Path -> Slack Node:** If the rating is bad, it sends a message to our #feedback-alerts channel with the details.
4.  **Google Sheets Node:** This is connected to the main output of the IF Node (not the true/false paths). This was another mini 'aha' moment - the IF node passes *all* items through, just directing them to different outputs. So a node connected after it will receive all three of my test items, and they all get logged in the sheet.

That's it. A 20-minute weekly chore is now a zero-minute background task. But more importantly, a fundamental concept about n8n finally clicked into place. It's not about processing a *list*, it's about defining a *journey* for each individual *item*.

I know this might seem basic to the experts here, but I'm sharing it because I genuinely struggled with this concept, and I have a feeling I'm not the only one. Hopefully, this saves someone else the headache I went through.",1,1757397120.0,n8nforbeginners,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone. I just wanted to say that I am still here. I am alive. Im well. Not that anyone will see this. but i do care about everyone no matter where. should i post more? let me know. 

I didnt kill myself on Valentines day like i had planned. I didnt shoot myself with a friends gun after seeing the girl i wished i looked like at the store. Ive been clean from self harm for a few months now. clean from my BAD self harm for about 6months. I upped my meds, and got off of my others (turns out i was allergic to them this whole time). Almost a year since 'the reckoning' (the day i was broken up with and my worst nightmares came true). And i am........... still here.

I work 4 jobs. I have maximum amount of credit hours in school, which is a huge workload. I still sing in choir. I plan to do Mammia Mia with my town theatre next spring. I keep a 4.0 gpa. Ive won awards for my design work. Im a party princess/cosplayer on the weekends. I get to see and interact with so many wonderful and lovely people each and every day. I get to snuggle my cat goodnight and wake up to hot coffee and a fresh day of classes and work ahead of me. I may still hate my body, but i know that it gets better with time. i get compliments, i just have to work on believing them.....

I no longer have such a desire to die that I would run outside alone at 2 am hoping to be kidnapped. I no longer have to worry that you will be somewhere when I need time to myself. I dont think about you as much. I know what youve done (for the most part) and it hurts me still, it always will. i want to believe i deserve to be loved. I try to take care of myself. I love those around me unconditionally,  as I always have. I still love you, after all the hurting youve caused me. I should hate you, but i dont. I dont hate people. I dont hate you. I never will. I wish you love. 

I wish myself love. 

I am so proud of me.

Thank you for reading. please know you are loved, even if it doesnt feel like it (ive felt it before, too.) üíô

1ncawp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1ncawp2/help_escalating_a_bait_and_switch_long_term_stay/,Help Escalating a Bait and Switch Long Term Stay and Mail Withholding [USA],"I have been using Airbnb for 10+ years and this is my first time running into an issue. I booked a 2-month stay through Airbnb with a company that runs a bunch of ‚Äúfurnished apartments.‚Äù The photos looked had some slightly outdated furniture but looked clean and well taken care of. However, when we got there the unit was a clear bait and switch:

- The furniture is completely different from the listing. The couch was visibly stained all over as if it was pulled out of a dumpster, one of the kitchen chairs was broken, one of the shower head flew off when we turned the water on, the sink is missing hardware, half the slats on the vertical blinds are missing (no privacy)

- One of the closet door immediately fell off and hit me on the head, leaving a bruise. 

- Oven had streaks all over the front and was dirty

- The unit has really thin windows and it‚Äôs impossible to sleep with the loud traffic outside. 

Within. 24 hours of arriving, we decided that this is too many issues and contacted Airbnb with pictures of everything. Airbnb asked me to work with a host and he reached out offering to me to another unit that he promised was cleaner, quieter and more recently updated unit. I ask that to see the unit before agreeing to move and the host said he would come back and schedule a time to view. 

Next day, the host came back and said actually the unit is occupied and they won‚Äôt be able to move us into two weeks from now. We are annoyed at this point but too tired from not sleeping due to the noise to fight him so agreed to the two week wait. 

- The next week some building staff came by and fixed the shower, faucet and reattached the closet door. 

- Within a week coffee maker broke and took 3 days to replace.

- We discovered that though the listing said it accommodates 6, only one key fob was provided. Since one of the doors require a key fob and has no keypad. Everyone has to go together or the rest of the group is effectively trapped if one person goes out with a fob by themselves.  We contacted the host and he said he would only provide another Fob for a pretty significant fee 

- Host kept asking/trying to call/text me off-platform even after I asked several time to keep communication in Airbnb chat since we are in contentious territory. 

I feel dumb allowing this to drag out to a month but I just moved here and was figuring out new job and state. Finally, we got fed up waiting and booked another AirBnb and asked to cancel. Airbnb refunded unused nights quickly but is dragging on the used night. I‚Äôve documented everything with photos, messages, and time stamps. 

- Airbnb‚Äôs lowest level support called and told me that the host accused me of breaking the closet door and offered a discretionary 30% back. I declined as I don‚Äôt believe this is a fair outcome. I managed to get escalate to a supervisor, but then the supervisor got disconnected. I followed up in Airbnb Support chat to document that the supervisor hung up on me and asked to speak to trust and safety.

- After checkout, my partner tried to get our mail, and the host told the leasing office withhold it unless I called him directly. I am reluctant to do this as I wanted everything to be clearly documented via Airbnb channels. I am aware that withholding mail is a federal offense and mentioned it explicitly in the chat with Airbnb support 

Questions:

Ive spent hours today talking to outsourced support. i finally after several hours managed to hit the magical keywords somehow and got escalated and the manager who pretended not to be able to hear me and hing up. What is the best way to cut through the maze that is the AirBnb support escalation system?  I have clear photo documentation and a chat history that clearly shows that day I checked in I had all these issues and a history of the host stalling and only partially fixing issues. 

Has anyone here successfully pushed Airbnb‚Äôs Trust & Safety team to intervene in cases like this? Can you share your experience?

I wanted to ask from real people like me as to by how much - is it discernible for a relative amateur (I've been brewing Aeropress for the last year or so).

I tend to finish my 250g pack in around a week or 10 days and I think I'm fine with the degradation till that time.

I wanted to know how much of a difference would I be able to feel if I go the freshly ground route and invest in a Timemore C3 for example. Is it worth going into and making that jump? Or should I just stick to pre-ground? How much of a maintenance overhead is actually owning a grinder?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Designing a two-story barndominium with a wrap-around porch is an exciting and rewarding project. This combination brings together rustic charm and modern convenience, allowing you to create a space that meets all your needs. Imagine stepping out onto a welcoming porch, surrounded by nature while enjoying the architectural beauty of your home. Here‚Äôs how to make the most of this design choice.

### Embrace the Barndominium Aesthetic

The barndominium style combines the practicality of a barn with the comforts of a modern home. With its metal exterior and open space concept, it maintains a cozy feel while offering ample room for creativity. When you think about the design, consider how the exterior colors and materials can complement the natural landscape. You can choose wood accents, stone details, or stick with a sleek metal finish for a contemporary touch.

### Layout Considerations

The layout of a two-story barndominium is crucial for ensuring functionality. A well-thought-out floor plan will enhance your living experience. Here are key elements to include:

- **Open Living Space:** Keep the first floor open for easy movement and interaction. This area can include the living room, kitchen, and dining space.
- **Bedrooms:** Position the bedrooms on the second floor. This allows for privacy and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of daily activities.
- **Bathrooms:** Consider having at least two bathrooms, one on each floor. This feature enhances convenience for family members and guests.
- **Utility Room:** Allocate space for laundry needs and other household chores to keep everything organized.

### Maximizing Outdoor Space

A wrap-around porch adds significant outdoor enjoyment to your barndominium. Besides extending the living area, it offers various opportunities for leisure. Here‚Äôs how to capitalize on this feature:

- **Seating Areas:** Equip the porch with comfortable furniture like rocking chairs or a swinging bench. This creates a perfect spot for relaxation and family gatherings.
- **Outdoor Dining:** Consider adding a table and grill setup. This makes outdoor dining a breeze during warm weather.
- **Landscaping:** Enhance the porch‚Äôs appeal by framing it with flowers, shrubs, or even outdoor lights. This brings beauty and a welcoming atmosphere.
- **Access Points:** Ensure that the porch connects seamlessly to the main living areas. This invites the outdoors in and makes entertaining guests easier.

### Eco-Friendly Design Choices

Integrating sustainable choices into your barndominium design not only benefits the environment but also reduces long-term costs. Consider the following:

- **Insulation:** Utilize high-quality insulation to maintain temperature and energy efficiency.
- **Solar Panels:** Installing solar panels on the metal roof can significantly reduce energy bills over time.
- **Rainwater Collection:** Design the roof to capture rainwater for landscaping or non-potable household uses.
- **Energy-Efficient Windows:** Choose double-glazed windows to improve insulation and reduce heating and cooling needs.

### Choosing the Right Aesthetics

Your choice of aesthetics will set the tone for your barndominium. Blending traditional and modern looks can create a unique style. Here are some tips:

- **Color Palette:** Opt for earthy tones or bold colors that reflect your personality and fit the natural surroundings.
- **Interior D√©cor:** Use reclaimed wood, metal accents, and comfortable fabrics to enhance the cozy ambiance.
- **Lighting:** Install a mix of natural light sources and stylish fixtures to illuminate the space effectively.

A two-story barndominium with a wrap-around porch merges style with practicality, creating a home that you and your family will love. Through thoughtful design choices, you can ensure that your living space is both functional and visually appealing.

Benefits of Owning a 2 Story Barndominium with Wrap Around Porch for Modern Living
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Living in a 2 story barndominium with a wrap around porch offers numerous advantages that cater to the needs of modern homeowners. These unique structures blend the charm of a traditional barn with all the comforts and conveniences of a modern home, creating a space that is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.

One of the most celebrated benefits of a 2 story barndominium is ample living space. With two floors, you can separate your living and sleeping areas, which is ideal for families. The layout allows for privacy, as bedrooms can be located upstairs while common areas remain downstairs. This setup promotes an organized environment, making it easier for everyone to enjoy their individual downtime.

Another standout feature is the wrap around porch. This expansive outdoor space enhances your lifestyle, encouraging outdoor living. Imagine sipping your morning coffee while enjoying nature, or hosting evening gatherings with friends and family. The wrap around porch provides the perfect space to relax and unwind, offering stunning views from every angle of your property.

Additionally, barndominiums are known for their energy efficiency. These structures typically use metal siding and roofing, which can help insulate your home better than traditional wood. Many designs incorporate energy-efficient windows and smart home technologies that contribute to lower utility bills. This is a practical advantage for modern living, making it easier on your wallet while minimizing your carbon footprint.

Cost-effectiveness is another reason why many people opt for a 2 story barndominium. The materials used in construction are often more affordable than traditional home building materials. The open floor plans also allow for less waste during construction. Generally, barndominiums can be built faster than traditional homes, reducing labor costs significantly. If you are looking for an economical option that doesn't compromise on quality, a barndominium is an excellent choice.

The versatility of a 2 story barndominium is appealing as well. You can customize the space to fit your lifestyle and needs. Whether you require an office, gym, or extra storage, the flexible layout enables you to create distinct areas for various activities. This adaptability allows homeowners to tailor their environments specifically to their interests, making each barndominium a unique haven.

Furthermore, when you invest in a 2 story barndominium with a wrap around porch, you create an outdoor extension of your living space. This encourages more family activities, such as gardening, barbecues, or simply enjoying the fresh air. The design is not only functional; it also invites social interaction, making it perfect for gatherings or family celebrations.

- **Open Floor Plans:** These designs often come with large, open areas, making interior designs feel spacious and inviting.
- **Rural Aesthetic:** Barndominiums blend well with rural settings, enhancing the natural beauty of your lot.
- **Community Engagement:** With outdoor spaces, you can engage more with neighbors and the community, strengthening relationships.

Safety is a consideration that many homeowners factor into their buying decisions. Thanks to modern building codes and materials, 2 story barndominiums often meet or exceed safety regulations. Moreover, the construction techniques used in barndominiums can increase resistance to harsh weather conditions, ensuring a secure environment for you and your family.

In addition, you can further capitalize on the investment potential of a 2 story barndominium. As the demand for unique living spaces grows, properties like these could appreciate significantly over time. This attractive potential for growth makes it a wise choice for those seeking to invest in their future.

A 2 story barndominium with a wrap around porch invites a sense of community and connection. Its design fosters gatherings and shared moments, enriching lives by bringing people together. Whether it‚Äôs family dinners on a summer night or a cozy book reading on a rainy day, this living space is more than just a house; it‚Äôs a home where memories are created.

### Conclusion

A 2 story barndominium with a wrap-around porch offers an exceptional fusion of aesthetics and practicality, making it an ideal choice for contemporary living. The design possibilities are endless, allowing you to create a space that truly reflects your personal style while maintaining the functionality required for everyday life. With spacious interiors, you can enjoy open-concept layouts that enhance both social gatherings and family time, while the layout promotes optimal use of space.

The benefits of owning such a unique structure extend beyond mere looks. The wrap-around porch not only serves as a scenic outdoor area for relaxation and entertainment but also enhances the overall curb appeal of your home. This inviting feature encourages a connection with nature and provides a gathering spot for family and friends, fostering a sense of community right at your doorstep.

Moreover, choosing a barndominium can be a cost-effective solution, combining affordability with modern amenities. As energy-efficient designs become more popular, you can enjoy lower utility costs while contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle.

SUNDAY, AUGUST 17th (Full Day #3)
Tower Roosevelt to Old Faithful 

BLACKTAIL PLATEAU DRIVE/ALBRIGHT VISITOR CENTER/SHEEPEATER CLIFF/TWIN LAKES/NORRIS CANYON ROAD/GRAND CANYON, NORTH RIM/HAYDEN VALLEY/SULPHUR CAULDRON/MUD VOLCANO/FISHING BRIDGE/CONTINENTAL DIVIDE PICNIC AREA/GRAND PRISMATIC SPRING/BLACK SAND BASIN/OLD FAITHFUL INN

On our way to Old Faithful area, we decided to retrace some roads and do things we'd rushed by or failed to see on previous days. We'd ultimately make a sort of ""S"" shape in driving that day. Knowing how much there was to see around the Upper and Lower Geyser Basins was making me a bit nervous about time, however.

BLACKTAIL PLATEAU DRIVE:
Unable to dedicate more time to Lamar, we headed back northwest toward Mammoth and took a quick detour for another try for wildlife on Blacktail Plateau Drive at the request of my boyfriend. Still a beautiful drive, but yielded no luck for major sightings.

ALBRIGHT VISITOR CENTER, MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS:
This had been a big thing on my personal itinerary that we didn't do during our stay in Mammoth the first night. This stop is a must-see for history buffs, giving a great outline of the history of the park and the military era before the NPS was founded. As an amateur artist, it was very exciting for me to see the journal and sketchbook of Thomas Moran, who created the famous painting of Yellowstone Falls you hear talked about. There is also an excellent display of taxidermy here, for those who enjoy that particular art. This was around 9am and so it wasn't too crowded.


SHEEPEATER CLIFF:
A neat little stop that doesn't take much time, there were only one other couple stopped there mid-morning. I had my greatest wildlife defeat here when I nearly snapped a photo of a Pika at close range. My boyfriend walked up right then and the Pika disappeared! I waited, but he was gone in the rock jumble at the cliff base. Still got some gorgeous shots of the cliff columns, but I'm so upset about missing that photo opportunity!

TWIN LAKES: 
Another little stop, we pulled over because my boyfriend saw swans on the lake. We lingered for a bit watching the swans and scanning further out with binoculars. Very peaceful. After leaving here we would drive south to the Norris Canyon Road to cut across the middle of the park. 

NORRIS CANYON ROAD:
This road is the most utilitarian in the park, with very little to see compared with the rest. It is, however, the only way to cut across the park in the middle. We stopped at the small Fire Exhibit, which discussed the impact of the 1988 fire that raged through the area.

GRAND CANYON OF YHE YELLOWSTONE, NORTH RIM DRIVE:
I was neutral to the idea, but my boyfriend really wanted to see the North Rim Drive. It's undeniably pretty, and we got some gorgeous canyon shots further down. It certainly allowed for different views from the South Rim. We arrived here a little later than we arrived at the South Rim the previous day, and parking seemed tighter and more crowds and traffic in general. Timing truly can matter a lot when you're wanting to visit the big attractions in Yellowstone.

HAYDEN VALLEY:
Driving south, we hit Hayden Valley just around noon; our third venture through the area. After Lamar Valley, we really did see why Hayden is often referred to as ""Lamar Valley Lite"". But, behold, Hayden still had a surprise in store! As we were driving, we saw one car pulled off to the right and my boyfriend started keenly scanning, soon insisting ""pull over, pull over!"" I did, and soon I saw what he saw: a mama grizzly with two cubs in tow! They were a ways off, but totally visible with the naked eye, and for some time kept walking closer towards us. Others began pulling over, and folks driving by eagerly asking what we spotted. The bear family then began walking more parallel to the road; we watched the mama bear sniff the air and investigate things as she walked, with the cubs bounding behind. Soon they veered back into the distance and disappeared behind some tall grass and rolling hills. We were surprised to have our best bear encounter right in the middle of the day! Feeling absolutely grateful for the experience, we drove onward.

SULPHUR CAULDRON:
A quick stop that dovetails nicely into exploring Mud Volcano, which lies just up the road. I don't think I've mentioned the sulfur smell that you encounter with many geothermal features, but it's definitely a thing! Sulphur Cauldron gives you a big old wallop of it! One of the most acidic features in the park, the area surrounding it is fun to watch boil and bubble and burp. 

MUD VOLCANO:
Mud Volcano was a stop I had regretted not doing when we stayed in the Lake Yellowstone area. The ranger we had spent time with at Norris Geyser Basin was really enthusiastic about it, especially Dragon's Mouth Spring and the unique acidic qualities of the area features. Lots more boiling, bubbling, and burping to be had here. Dragon's Mouth Spring was indeed the standout for us; watching the steam roaring out and the little waves eminate from the cave is mesmerizing. We got caught in an afternoon thunderstorm part way through and ended up getting soaked, but it didn't phase us at all. It cleared out the crowds for a bit and we practically ran down the hill at the end, refreshed and our clothing already drying out as the sun reemerged. 

FISHING BRIDGE:
Something I failed to mention was that one of my tires had sprung a slow leak that we discovered in the morning after we stayed at Lake Lodge. We aired it up at the Roosevelt service station, but we knew we had to get it dealt with. I knew there was a repair shop at the Fishing Bridge service station and reasoned it might be less busy than the one at Old Faithful. We stopped in and the nice guys in the shop were able to get us taken care of right away! Thankfully it was just a little nail in there and an easy patch. We were just happy to be back on the road quickly, because having car problems on vacation is no fun. 

CONTINENTAL DIVIDE PICNIC AREA:
I think this is probably the only picnic area I'm listing on it's own. We stopped here for lunch, again finding posted notices of bear activity, like the day before at the picnic area in Lamar Valley. The main difference is that we were the only ones there in this beautiful, forested picnic area. It was quiet and felt really isolated. I'm not sure if it's always like that, but it was peaceful and a bit spooky at the same time. I kept my bear spray on the picnic table next to me.

OLD FAITHFUL AND OLD FAITHFUL INN:
Finally! We arrived at the Old Faithful area right around 3pm, and somehow my managed to find a front row spot in the Old Faithful parking lot? The area was packed, but we sure lucked out there. We got out of the car and walked up the steps toward the Old Faithful Inn, trying to take in the area and the vast numbers of crowds surrounding the inn and eponymous geyser itself. Suddenly a woman said, ""Look behind you!"" We turned to see Beehive Geyser erupting just across the parking lot! We walked in that direction with many other folks, taking photos and video. A knowledgeable, older man we were talking with told us which geyser we were looking at and also told us we were getting close to an Old Faithful eruption time. We meandered over and found a place in the crowd around Old Faithful, at the part of the observation deck closest to the Inn. While waiting for the big show, Lion Geyser suddenly went off to our left, in a magnificent opening act! We were lucky and had a great vantage point for that at the end of the platform...more photos and videos! We again went back to waiting patiently, and finally Old Faithful began to stir in tiny bursts before finally releasing a full gush. I was taking video. Let me tell you... it's a true delight to share this experience with other human beings. The collective gasps and cheers when it goes off is pure joy. We were surrounded by people from all over the world, speaking a dozen languages within earshot. How special it is that we all got to share that simple sense of wonder together on our individual vacations.

With three different geysers welcoming us within less than an hour, we felt primed to experience the rustic grandeur that is the historic Old Faithful Inn. I opine quite a bit about my experience in my post about lodging, but some of it bears repeating here. My boyfriend and I were both in awe the moment we walked in, and I got a bit teary eyed to see the grand old hotel in the flesh. It was everything I'd hoped and I dream of staying there again. Even if you don't stay there, do yourself a favor and at least check out the lobby. Not only does it feel like walking into history, it makes you a part of it. It's magic. We got settled into our small room and planned our next move while sitting on the enormous balcony deck at the front of the inn, watching Old Faithful erupt for a second time.

GRAND PRISMATIC SPRING: We decided to plan for a later dinner and chance heading up to Grand Prismatic Spring area in Midway, leaving our entire morning available for the Old Faithful area the next day. We arrived around 5:30pm, and there were certainly plenty of crowds, although we got really lucky and found a place close to the boardwalk entrance. The whole area is cool, but the nature of Grand Prismatic means that it kind of dominates the experience. I lamented not having enough time to do the overlook, but still thoroughly appreciated the experience we had there. Even with the steam, we both got some gorgeous photos of it and the runoff patterns around it. Opal Pool was another standout for us, so be sure not to miss it. 

BLACK SAND BASIN: Knowing we still had good daylight to burn, we stopped off at Black Sand Basin on a whim because it seemed easy. I had read about it in my guidebooks, but couldn't recall any details. At 6:30pm, we found plenty of parking and it felt very empty compared to the crowds we just dealt with at Grand Prismatic. Black Sand Basin was amazing! We both loved it. Opalescent Pool, Rainbow Pool, Emerald Pool, and Sunset Lake are all unique and colorful features that made for great photos. I kind of feel in love with Cliff Geyser a little bit, too. We watched it erupt a couple times and it's just got personality. Much like West Thumb, we went in not knowing what to expect but came away feeling like we had a special experience. Black Sand Basin may be small, but it is mighty! 

OLD FAITHFUL INN (EVENING):
We arrived back and found the parking lot at Old Faithful to be an absolute nightmare at 8pm. We had to circle many times before finding a spot way out in the back of the lot. By that time we were ready for dinner, but still had an hour before our reservation time at the Old Faithful Dining Room. They had live music in the lobby with a piano and violin duo, and we happily sat and listened while soaking in the ambiance of the whole place. It was actually perfect. We ended up being very happy with our dining experience here, as discussed already in my lodging post. I slept like a dream that night.

MONDAY, AUGUST 18th (Departure, Half Day)

OLD FAITHFUL INN/HAMILTON'S STORE/OLD FAITHFUL VISITOR CENTER/GEYSER HILL & CASTLE-GRAND AREA

OLD FAITHFUL INN (MORNING): My boyfriend slept in for a bit while I got up and found myself a cup of coffee in the cafe downstairs; the coffee was nothing special, but I need it in the morning. I decided to move the car up closer now that spots were available, and just as I was walking through the front doors, Old Faithful began erupting! Luckily I had my phone and snapped some amazing shots backlit by the morning sun. After moving the car, I just sat in the lobby for a while, trying to soak in every aspect of the old lodge and commit it to memory. I really, really wished we could have another night there. I finally roused my boyfriend, and we packed and checked out before beginning our exploration of the boardwalks.

HAMILTON'S STORE:
A souvenir store and snack shop next to Old Faithful Inn, the main reason I wanted to go here is because it's a contemporary of the Inn and the artictecure is meant to compliment it. It's a charming old building with tons of character, and I'm so glad we stopped in. The gift shop at Old Faithful Inn is certainly more diverse, so save your souvenir money for the better selection there.

OLD FAITHFUL VISITOR CENTER:
A good place to go for information, for sure. It is well staffed and has informative displays, and I think they have more frequent ranger talks than any other place in the park. Make sure to get a map. That being said, this particular visitor center had a very sterile feeling about it, and I didn't find it as engaging as the Albright Visitor Center at Mammoth, but that's apples to oranges. 

GEYSER HILL/CASTLE-GRAND AREA:
So, here's the thing: the Upper Geyser Basin encompasses a fairly large area. We vowed to do as much as we could before keeping on our target time for departure (we had a 5+ hour drive to a cabin in Idaho ahead of us). We started at Geyser Hill and watched Old Faithful erupt yet again (the fourth for me) from the vantage point of the boardwalk near Anemone Geysers. It made for neat photos with Old Faithful Inn in the background. We got to see both Beehive and Lion Geysers up close, which was fun since we'd seen both erupt the previous day from near the Inn. I love the perfect little cone that Beehive has. We got some great photos of the area near South Scalloped Spring, where the thermophiles make for beautiful colors and patterns set against the backdrop of the Firehole River. The boardwalk was closed off near Spasmodic Geyser, so we walked down toward Castle Geyser and lingered there hoping to catch an eruption. Keeping an eye on the clock, we knew we had to make a decision about when to leave. It was now after noon, and headed back to our car in the parking lot. It was time to go. 

DEPARTURE: We said our last goodbyes to the grand Old Faithful Inn and headed out, stopping at the Firehole River Picnic Area for a quick lunch before reaching Madison Junction. We had forgot to drop our bear spray rentals at the Old Faithful drop off point, so we stopped in West Yellowstone and dropped them off there. We stopped in at the Eagles Store, which is a fun stop and a great place to get last minute souvenirs. I believe it's been run by the same family for 100 years, and the current building dates from the 1920's.

FINAL THOUGHTS: 
I don't regret anything about our trip, and we hit all the ""big"" things on our itinerary outline. We liked staying in a different place each night, although I'd love to do two nights at Old Faithful Inn if we ever go back. I think it's important to keep your time flexible, but trying to hit the popular stops (Norris Basin, Canyon Area, Mammoth, Old Faithful Area, Grand Prismatic) in the morning or evening did make a difference when dealing with crowds and parking. This is a wise approach with wildlife watching, too; athough some of it is just sheer luck, like our grizzly family sighting in Hayden right in the middle of the afternoon.

OUR FAVORITE THINGS:  
We both really liked the Lamar Valley, and I think our timing was great for bison watching at the end of the rut season. I just fell in love with those deeply majestic, goofy creatures...we're beyond lucky to have them given the history of their being hunted to near extinction. The geyser basins were all cool in their own way, and it's interesting to see how their character differs from each other. Some of the smaller areas like Black Sand and West Thumb offer really unique and beautiful features, so don't discount the small stuff; sometimes they're a nice stop when the popular places are super busy. We both liked Mammoth for it's walkable nature and the interesting history of the area. Old Faithful Inn was a real highlight for both of us and we loved staying there, even in spite of the crowds that the larger Old Faithful area draws in. In a place where nature has created its own masterpiece sculpted from the land itself, so did architect Robert Reamer craft the only structure that could look at home in it: Old Faithful Inn. An American cathedral hewn from the landscape of the frontier.

WHAT WE LEARNED:
When I was planning the trip I said, ""I don't want to be the people who never leave the boardwalks."" But, we kind of ended up not leaving the boardwalks. Which is to say, we didn't get any of those easy hikes in. Not even the one to Fairy Falls and Grand Prismatic, which was the one I had prioritized most highly in planning. We could have structured out time differently. We could have gotten up earlier, and we could have cut out some of the small stops or time wildlife watching in the valleys and Blacktail Plateau. We probably didn't need to do both rims of the Grand Canyon. Artists Paintpots was cool, but we could have skipped that. And we definitely could have skipped all the minor waterfalls. But we didn't. We didn't knock ourselves out trying to fit everything in, and you don't know until you know. I would have liked to have spent more time in the Lake area, and done the Storm Point Trail. I definitely would have liked to have seen the lower geyser basin, and wish we had not run out of time for the northern upper geyser basin. Even without any hikes, we still got miles of walking in. We saw so, so much. We have incredible photos and memories to last a lifetime. And, if we do go back, we now know where we'd like to focus our time. It's a big park, and there's never as much time as you think.

\- She is calm but serious, sometime joking around but always calm except when she is with her wife

\- At first, she thinks that money is everything but now her wife is everything

\- She remade her glass, now its chain has 2 symbols: Spade (her wife like the ace of spade) and diamond (she like the ace of diamond)

\- Not a random fact but she loves her wife the most.

# Cosmology (See final image)

There is an infinite amount of 3 dimensional universes in the multiverse, each universe houses an infinite amount of galaxies.

Heaven and Hell are completely separate dimensions from the Multiverse, however, they have authorities, control over the Multiverse, and simply above any possible aspects within the Multiverse. These two dimensions can only be accessed via death, Rituals, Magic or Tarot cards (Chariot).

The ‚ÄúChess Board‚Äù (that‚Äôs how Catherine calls it) is a 4D space that is only accessible to Catherine (she can teleport to it). ‚ÄúChess Board‚Äù dimension has 2 types, each randomly get chosen when Catherine teleport to here.

She can either teleport to the Chess Board for shelter or do the following:  
When an opponent is transferred to the Chess Board, all of their knowledges and powers related to magic are stripped away and they will have to participate in a proper duel with Catherine.

The chess board is believed to encompass all other dimensions.

\- Type 1: Literally a huge 50x50m chess board without any pieces.

\- Type 2: A long gothic style room, the length of the room still unknown. At the middle of the room when teleport to here, there is a long dining table with a chess board.

This dimension can affect her opponent even if they‚Äôre from other dimension such as ‚ÄúHell‚Äù so she thinks that this dimension might be bigger than all other dimension.



# COMBAT

**(Some Combat Information)**

1-She knows all fencing theory and also left-handed, that‚Äôs make Catherine always win a sword fight since she has some advantages.

2-She can always dodge or counter any hit, she also cannot miss an attack due to her passive

3-If she has the chance, she would spare her opponents except for those who use reverse grip, scythe, dual long sword and any other weird weapon.

**(Weapon combination)**

1-Remington Model 1894 and an axe

2-Dual M1911

3-Rapier/Saber with M1911

4-Longsword with a sawed-off Remington Model 1894 or Colt M1877

5-Dual Colt 1851 Navy Revolver

(Passive Ability) High Roller: Any chance, be it fighting or gambling, if other than 0% and 100% guarantees victory for her. For example: if the winning rate is 1% or 0.00000001%, be it anything larger than 0, High Roller can force the chance into 100% and pull victory towards Catherine. Anything at 0% is either erased or non-existent.

**(Combat style)**

\-She always defense, not adjective attacking her enemy. (This means that she will always parry and wait for them to make a mistake and find the perfect moment to strike.)

\-Always use hanging guard

\-The combo left-handed and always use hanging guard made her always win with most opponent without using magic. Dang is she a skilled swordswoman.

\-If she uses Sawed-off Model 1894 or Colt M1877 (combination number 4) she could use gun to parry attacks (By using the handle as a kind of hook?)

\-With her bare hand, she could easily punch her enemy but she doesn‚Äôt like to rip her gloves so she doesn‚Äôt punch too much

\-She knows everything about HEMA, even the weapon she hasn‚Äôt seen before. (Basically she knows EVERYTHING about historical weapons?)

\-She hates ridiculously big weapons such as fictional character‚Äôs longsword



# Abilities

(Skill) Light On Fire: When draws a sword (rapier/longsword/saber) out of scabbard quickly, the sword will burn. Add bonus damage, piercing and burn effect.

(Skill) Vanish: Her hat vanishes when anything is about to touch it in combat, when out of combat, it reappears

(Skill) Vision: Cahterine takes of her glass, slows time and see enemy‚Äôs weakness so it‚Äôs easier for her to active skill ‚ÄúRipper‚Äù

(Skill) Ripper: Dash to enemy and slice at their neck in the blink of an eye, distant and speed becomes irrelevant when combined with The Devil card.

(Skill) The Cult‚Äôs Decision: Catherine picks one of the 22 major acana in Rider‚ÄìWaite tarot deck. High Roller still affects the rate when picking but the rate only changes from 0.045% to 45.45% for the card she wants. each card gives her an ability or gives opponent a debuff. She sometimes also picks some in minor arcana but the power of those cards are still unknown, even Catherine doesn‚Äôt even know all of them



# Power of each card:

0-The Fool: Wipe opponent‚Äôs memory of their fighting skills and show an illusion of their deepest fear

I- The Magician (The Juggler): Show Catherine the best choice possible. She also given ability to steal and copy the power of her opponent

II- The Hight Priest (The Popess): Give special senses, Catherine can know and dodge or counter all the next opponent‚Äôs attack

III-The Empress: Make opponent lose their will to fight and reduce all the damage from their attack

IV-The Emperor: Buff Catherine‚Äôs damage and attack speed, she will also become immune to all damage. She also can bring opponent to ‚ÄúChess Board‚Äù dimension. She also have ability to execute opponent when she picked up The Empress with this card

V- The Hierophant (The Popess): Show Catherine all information of opponent. If she picks this with The Popess, she will gain the ability to manipulate opponent (Mind Control, Body Control). This card also give Catherine ability to see the future.

VI-The Lovers: Catherine hold one card, and Aki (her wife) hold the other. When use, Catherine can teleport to Aki, or Aki teleport to her, or heal Aki, Or teleport Aki to a safer dimension.

VII-The Chariot: She have ability to teleport herself (Essentially anywhere in her cosmology) and call her horse

VIII-Strength: Buff Catherine‚Äôs strength and debuff her opponent‚Äôs strength (both physical and mental)

IX-The Hermit: Catherine teleports her opponent but her opponent MUST be teleported to somewhere isolate including the 3 dimension ‚ÄúHeaven‚Äù, ‚ÄúHell‚Äù and ‚ÄúChess Board‚Äù

X-Wheel of Fortune: This card increases the chance to pick any tarot card she needs (from 45.45% to 60%), she also can share her passive to only one person in one circumstance. She can also drain opponent‚Äôs luck and make any opponent can reach out of the percentage theory have to follow the percentage theory

XI-Justice: This is the special card only be picked if Catherine is fighting a worthy opponent. When pick, both Catherine and her opponent teleport to ‚ÄúChess Board‚Äù dimension and both will have a saber/rapier/long sword and they will have a duel. This duel is completely fair, no one is stronger or faster, only fencing skill can make one of them win. when finish (Catherine win ofc) the winner and the body of the loser will be teleported back to where they were before the duel

XII-The Fool (Again?): Sacrifice the card and gain a random stat (speed/damage) with a random amount (not affected by her passive). Or gain another card‚Äôs ability

XIII-Death: Opponent die immediately, she can‚Äôt control how the opponent dies though. Varies through Rapid Aging or the most painful death in existence. (kinda boring)

XIV-Temperance: Heal herself or another one from any wound, also can revive anyone when they‚Äôre killed, not dead by nature and the card only revive when that person died within 24 hours

XV-The Devil: The most powerful and destructive card. Catherine will turn into devil form. In devil form she manifests a burning longsword and it is said that this card gives its user enough power to literally kill anyone and destroy anything, even in heaven and hell, Catherine also gains the ability to fly and teleport without using cards like Chariot. She can also teleport both her and her opponent to ‚ÄúHell‚Äù dimension, her opponent will gain burning effect, if that is a cyborg or some sort of robot (clanker), they will be melted but human will not melt

XVI-The Tower: The second most powerful and destructive. Catherine will shatter everything around but in a small range like a city (She could shatter a whole universe instantly, even the multiverse‚Ä¶ but because she has a wife and she adores her wife so she would never do that), there is 50% chance that her opponent will die peacefully. In 50% other, they have to fight her, but all of the attack they deal, none of them will go as they planned, anything that could go wrong WILL go wrong. They‚Äôre also weaker (both physical and mental) and Catherine gain all of their strengths.

XVII-The Star: give allies a big strength buff (both physical and mental)

XVIII-The Moon: drain all her opponent mental strength and take it as physical strength, she will manipulate and show them all things they scared and make them cannot get out of their thought

XIX-The Sun: Make her opponent stuck in their dream of peace, enlightenment and understanding. They cannot escape.

XX-Judgement: If opponent make any mistake when combat, this card will punish them depend on what mistake they made (this card can punish them by death)

XXI-The World: Catherine gain all strength, speed and any other stat from all allies/enemy. Each person give her x% stat (x% is how strong they are when compared to Catherine, Catherine is 100%) and add 777% if x>200

Those in brackets are the card‚Äôs name in Tarot de Marseille deck for easier recognition. Also, the card VII is ‚ÄúStrength‚Äù and card XI is ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù because Catherine use a copy of deck",3,1757395928.0,OriginalCharacterDB,1,1.0,False

After testing different options, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

# 1. Coworking Spaces

‚úÖ Pros:

* Reliable Wi-Fi (most of the time).
* Easy way to meet other nomads and network.
* Comfortable chairs, good desks, sometimes amazing views.

‚ùå Cons:

* Can be expensive (monthly memberships often cost more than rent).
* Gets busy and noisy at peak times.
* Sometimes feels like going back to an office 9‚Äì5.



# 2. Caf√©s

‚úÖ Pros:

* Tons of them, great food & smoothies on tap.
* Free to sit (just buy a coffee).
* Some are super aesthetic ‚Äî very ‚ÄúBali IG vibe.‚Äù

‚ùå Cons:

* Wi-Fi is very hit or miss.
* Tiny tables, uncomfortable seating ‚Äî not great for long hours.
* Staying too long on one cappuccino feels awkward.

  
**3. Home Office Setup**

‚úÖ Pros:

* No distractions, fully your own schedule.
* In the long run, cheaper than coworking.
* Great if you need deep focus (coding, design, writing).

‚ùå Cons:

* Most villas aren‚Äôt designed for work ‚Äî plastic chairs, low tables.
* Hard to stay productive without proper gear.



üëâ What really made a difference for me: **renting equipment** like a standing desk, office chair, and monitor. It saved my back and boosted productivity a ton. And since it‚Äôs rental, I didn‚Äôt have to buy/resell when leaving.

üí° My takeaway:

* Short-term stay ‚Üí coworking is great for networking.
* Longer stay ‚Üí invest in a proper home setup, it pays off.



‚ö°Question for you guys: If you‚Äôve worked from Bali (or similar places), what setup worked best for you ‚Äî coworking, caf√©s, or home office?",1,1757395893.0,ExpatFIRE,0,0.67,False

That's not the part I'm uncertain about, by the way. What I'm uncertain about is...I'm getting the build done on Thursday.

1ncal3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1ncal3u/i_know_healing_isnt_linear_but_how_can_i_ever/,"I know healing isn't linear but how can I ever recover when the first time I was with someone I fully loved and trusted, I was deeply hurt and betrayed by them too in the end?","I won't pretend and say that overall I have a bad life because that's simply not true - I'm a pretty blessed person all things considered. Something I can never seem to get right though, are the men I choose to be with and the relationships I'm in. I know I'm a flawed person with my own issues, but I think I bring a lot to the table and am someone who genuinely loves the person I'm with. I have so many qualities that I know people claim they want in a partner. So why then, do I seem to end up with people who end up hating me and treating me so badly? 

I have been in a string of toxic and bad relationships as an adult. My college boyfriend was emotionally abusive and toxic. My boyfriend after him had a lot of personal family issues that he ended up taking out on me, was insecure, and I finally ended things when I caught him on dating apps. The next boyfriend after him was so abusive physically, verbally, and emotionally that he ended up getting arrested and charged with three misdemeanors and two felonies. 

To be honest, up until my most recent partner, I compared everyone I dated to my high school sweetheart because while we were young, we were truly in love and had a very sweet relationship. I chose to end it due to him moving for college, and we have remained friendly all these years and at times I wondered ""what if"". But when I met my most recent ex, all what ifs and thoughts of him melted away. He checked every box that he had, plus so much more. I was so sure. 

We met on Bumble and fell in love fast and hard. We were basically inseparable after our first date. He was everything I dreamed of in a partner and best of all - he was intentional and sure about me too. 

Hindsight looking back, there were certainly things that could have and maybe *should* have been red flags. He introduced me to his entire family in our second month of dating, for example, but the reasoning made sense: they live far away, and it was probably the only time I'd be able to meet them before his sisters wedding the following year. Or the fact he said I love you within one month. Or when he asked in month two if I'd want to move in with him the next year when his lease was up (he asked in December, the move happened in May) and I said yes. 

He took me to get my ring size and then two separate times after that we went to look at engagement rings and try them on; he even tried on some wedding bands himself. 

In the moment though, with how right it all felt, it just made sense. It happens, right? Sometimes you just know when you've met the one. I knew it on our first date and months later when we talked about it, he said he knew it too. 

I opened up to him about my past and my traumatic experience with being abused - something I kind of had to explain because he did something truly innocent that triggered a panic attack in me. He held me and hugged me and said he understood, and reassured me about how safe I was with him. 

We had some small arguments leading up to our move, but nothing crazy or extreme. We always communicated extremely well, I felt he was very emotionally intelligent, and we seemed to move past these issues with ease. Prior to signing the lease in April, I asked him again just to be sure, if he was sure he wanted to. He confidently and enthusiastically said yes, so we moved forward. 

I had lived with my ex before him and although I ended it, uprooting my life and dividing everything up and moving out of our apartment was extremely difficult. I imagine it's somewhat what going through a divorce feels like and it was just terrible. He knew all of this in detail and he knew I was scared to do it again but willing to make the jump because of how good things were with us. I begged him to be honest because I never wanted to be put in the position of doing that again. 

Almost immediately after the move, it was like he became a different person. The same guy who used to send me virtual gift cards for coffee on rough days, got me surprise flowers all the time, who literally used to run ahead of me to open my car door or would drop down in a millisecond to tie my shoe, who would constantly throughout the day text me little updates and cute memes and videos, who included me in everything as much as possible, suddenly didn't talk to me at all throughout the day and started making plans to hang out with friends alone. Which, don't get me wrong, I'm all for having time alone with friends - but he went from hardly ever doing that and pretty much always extending me an invite to join even if he knew I'd say no, to multiple times in a week going to meet up with a friend after work and coming home at like 8 or 9pm. 

We ended up getting into two big fights, which I felt became way bigger than they needed to be, and he almost broke up with me both times. However, we fully made up and agreed to move forward. 

So when we were out one day having a nice day together, literally laughing, kissing, saying I love you one hour and the next he was coldly and unemotionally breaking up with me in the middle of a restaurant - something in me truly broke. I've experienced bad breakups, I've been in love before, but nothing compares to this. We only lived together for three months! 

The same man who wouldn't even jokingly say I was dumb, called me a cunt and said he hated me a day after the breakup. Then a couple days after that, said I was the love of his life, one of the best people he's ever known, and his best friend. He even tried to ask me to remain friends. 

He claims we argued too much and were incompatible. But then when I try to be as objective and honest with myself as possible, I still fully believe he was the one who sort of started the very issues he was apparently breaking up with me over. I also find it...extremely difficult to buy the ""we're incompatible"" excuse. We both actively don't want kids, I was fully willing to move around the country and world with him for his job every 2-3 years, we constantly had fun together, we had fantastic sex, similar views on politics, wanted similar lifestyles, agreed on how to spend money, he loves his motorcycle and I was happy to go on rides with him, every major thing you can think of that would be important was 100% aligned and so were so many smaller things. 

I just don't know where to go from here. I've spent the last month ruminating and reading about difficult  breakups and attachment styles and have come to the conclusion he fits the description for dismissive avoidant, but that doesn't take away the pain from how blindsided I feel. I fully believed he was my person and we were going to get married.   
  
I feel like he stole the last bit of me that had hope there was someone out there for me. I can't risk ever getting myself hurt like this again, it's just about the most devastating thing I've been through. I will admit too that while I don't feel the pressure that some people do to be married or settled down by a certain age, I'm 29 and so pretty much every close friend of mine is in a serious relationship. Being the only single friend is hard. ",1,1757395695.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

( that's the title i want to give this story but this community need the title to be bigger, so you are reading this...)","This story developed in a coffee shop in Mcleodganj, it is a true story with no filters. 

A day back, I texted my friend asking about an elderly woman, let's call her Anna, asking for her number. My friend didn‚Äôt have her number. I really felt bad. Why? Why should I feel bad? Even I didn‚Äôt know. We meet a lot of people in this place, some are meant to be forgotten whereas some stay forever. Anna and her friend, let‚Äôs not give her a name, let‚Äôs simply call her 5g.  
  
5g? I will explain later. This is a story which has many layers. It dwells deep into who we are? Philosophical, I don‚Äôt know? Is it a story about two women or about a guy who simply misses his friend? I don‚Äôt know.  
  
It all happened on a rainy day. Don‚Äôt tell me, every day is a rainy day here. I need to agree, anyways, I was trying to cut on my calories and that is when I saw them in the other table. They were both having a good time, one was German for sure and the other may be English.  
  
Compared with the so called spiritual stories I heard, these women were interesting. Both of them were in their late 60s, yet their conversation was so energetic. I couldn‚Äôt help myself from eavesdropping into their conversation. Should I call it adamsdropping? I don‚Äôt know, I am just an Indian guy trying to write in a colonial tongue. So does it matter? I don‚Äôt think so.  
  
They were discussing a variety of things, especially their sorrows, which I am going to completely ignore in this story whereas their last bit of conversation got pinned into my heart. It is their story, not mine.  
  
Anna: why are you carrying everything on your shoulders?  
  
(5g lady has a peculiar nature of emptying everything into her bags and she will carry everything once she comes out of her room. Trust me, I am not making things up. She did it.)  
  
5g: compared with the weight I carry inside my mind, this weight is nothing to me, so I don‚Äôt mind.  
  
Anna was speechless and she simply stared at her friend and they paid their bills and they made a vow, that they will meet each other, the next day and left.  
  
There are certain moments where you don‚Äôt know what to do. This conversation kind of made my mind go blank and even when I meditated, it rocked me back and forth. I was thinking about the pain, some can call it drama but if you have gone through pain, you can emphatize with 5g. Can‚Äôt you? Even if you don‚Äôt, I understand, it is a tricky question.  
  
Anyways, life moves on and I nearly slipped after my dip at the waterfall and I came back for my breakfast. 5g lady entered and she was searching for Anna and Anna was not there and it kind of created a jolt to 5g lady, she was frozen for a moment, just standing, mind you, she was carrying a huge backpack on her shoulder, she ordered black coffee and she still stood at the counter, refusing to take a seat. Later, She got the coffee, went to a table, didn‚Äôt remove her bag, sat with the bag on her shoulders and she kept staring at the coffee.  
  
I was observing this and I didn‚Äôt have the courage to initiate a conversation, so I simply focused on my work. Then she gulped the coffee and left. After she departed, nearly 30 minutes would have passed. Anna came running by and she was searching for 5g and immediately came to me and asked whether I have seen 5g. I told she just left, Anna didn‚Äôt order anything and she ran out. She didn't even bother to reply to me. She was in a state of panic.  
  
After an hour, Anna came back exhausted, I asked whether she met her friend? She replied, no. I can see the sadness in her face. Next day, as usual, after my dip in waterfall, came to the restaurant and Anna was there waiting for her friend. I had things to do and I came back after 2 hours, still I could see Anna waiting. I left for the temple and I came back, still Anna was there waiting.  
  
Nearly after 5 hours of waiting, Anna left. 5g never came.

 I felt sorry for Anna as well as the 5g lady. That‚Äôs the night I texted my friend asking for Anna‚Äôs number. My friend is a satirical woman, I have never met anyone like her in my life and I couldn‚Äôt accept the fact that she is leaving in a week. I don‚Äôt know why I miss her so much either?  
  
Next day, I saw Anna but no 5g. Anna didn‚Äôt even acknowledge my existence, she was in her own world. Later that day, I saw anna at the temple, I thought I will complete my circumambulation and have a chat with her, I completed mine, but Anna had already left.  
  
I was wondering whether they will ever meet and why am I so eager for them to meet? And why I didn‚Äôt speak with 5g on that day? Many questions, but I had no answer. Luckily there was no rain by morning on this day and when my waterfall ritual was over, I was surprised to see both those ladies in the same table and they were so happy to see me too. I didn‚Äôt disturb them, as I wanted them to enjoy that moment together. There was so much relief in their faces, I think no amount of bitcoin could buy that.  
  
Epilogue  
  
I called her 5g as she fears the 5g, so she doesn‚Äôt carry a mobile. The pain I saw in both these women made me believe in humans again. The pain they emanated, when they couldn't meet each other, made me wonder, how come we are so connected? yet we think we are so apart? They were strangers, yet Anna understood 5gand 5g understood Anna. That's all it matters.

 Certain friendships get forged in heaven.

It‚Äôs been a nonstop shitshow since 2019 when my dad died, I had to move states and leave my home business that never got restarted in my new shitty state, tried leaving my abusive ex then but that didn‚Äôt work (lol long story) the anorexia I developed spiraled and I lost 100 pounds and started drinking, I became an insufferable drunk because I was an idiot that didn‚Äôt know how else to handle the abuse , so my ex tried suffocating me, finally left him & long court battles ensued but I ran out of money and my lawyer fucked me over (probably working with my ex‚Äôs) and I lost everything . Literally spent nearly $10k for a lawyer to drop me a month before court date?! Jesus I want to sue that **** took advantage of a severely disabled person (half my recommended weight due to anorexia). I almost died January ‚Äò23 due to passing out from the anorexia (they barely found me in time from a well check) and landed me in the hospital & mental hospital the first time‚Ä¶severe PTSD as I‚Äôm sure you can imagine. 

So then lived in a house with no propane for AC or heat or hot water (or stovetop) for a year and about lost my mind and life, went into psychosis (malnutrition, solitude, possibly withdrawals) for two weeks that was a persecutory hell in which I thought I died several times, and called the police on Myself because I thought I had intruders but I was grounded enough in reality for them to not call the mental hospital. Speaking of which, I did spend 40 days over 4 stretches in the mental hospital in a little over a year. I was broken.  Living like an animal was torture so with what little money I could scrape together I relapsed frequently. The last few months was spent between blackout drunk and withdrawal, not much between. I had 3 kitties that were 16, 15, & 11, and they all fucking died in a span of 3 months. When I tried to clean, my appliances broke. The dishwasher broke and flooded the kitchen, it took all my towels, then trying to wash the towels the dryer broke. Both vacuums. God I nearly gave tf up so many times. 

I finally managed to give up booze and smoking, and finally FINALLY am ok with normal eating after I put weight on; that took so much work because there‚Äôs no eating disorder clinics for poor people here. I‚Äôm still a little underweight and I get bouts of unrelenting painful gastritis in which I can‚Äôt keep fluid down about every 6 weeks. I fucking made it!! Rolling up on 1 year sober in October!! I‚Äôm finally gonna feel better, I thought!

And I did! I felt better for a few months. Started taking better care of myself, vitamins, nice skincare, got my family back. Everything is great!!! 

Til like February. Just stopped feeling rested with sleep. Started taking naps. Falling asleep drinking coffee. Feels like moving through water. Weird sweating I think is anxiety attacks at first; they‚Äôre drenching. Day and night and immediately chill after. Constantly uncomfortable. Got a checkup with the doctor and I‚Äôm being sent to hematology because there‚Äôs something in my blood that indicates bone marrow stress so they have to rule out cancer. Man, I‚Äôd be more worried if it‚Äôs lab error because wtf are these symptoms then? Some kind of an adrenal growth or something idk, it‚Äôs definitely *something.*

It‚Äôll get figured out soon enough (I HOPE because I feel absolutely awful wtf) and it‚Äôll be whatever it is, but can someone else just appreciate the absolute roller coaster madness that is my life right now? Which Greek god have I angered this week?

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1ncaev7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ncaev7,Our August Yellowstone Trip: Itinerary and Reflections (Part 1),"We started planning our trip to Yellowstone in April, and it was the first Yellowstone trip for my boyfriend (55) and myself (48). I immediately bought two used travel books and began looking at lodging options both inside and outside the park. 

To see my post with thoughts and reviews on our lodging, please see my previous post on that subject: https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/s/PWZ92CHn0Z

A bit about us and our travel approach: We were traveling from Oregon as a single couple in my Toyota sedan. I'm a history nerd and artistic type, while my boyfriend is a real outdoorsy guy who worships nature and loves to hike. We had a travel night in Idaho each way, and four nights in the park itself. Basically, three full days and a half day on either end. I read all the advice about factoring in lots of driving, being flexible because of crowds and bison jams, and not trying to overschedule. I decided that our lodging would be in four corners of the park (location order dictated by availability), so we would naturally stop and see things on the way to our next lodging destination. I made a list of the ""must see"" features, and then listed lower priority options to fit in as location and time dictated. Wildlife watching was a priority for both of us, but especially for my boyfriend. I also knew he'd want to get away from people now and then, and I envisioned being able to fit in one easy hike each day outside of the boardwalks. We also packed a cooler (sandwich fixings for lunch) and brought food that my boyfriend tends to like for camping meals (mostly packaged curry and noodles for dinner), as to make eating on the go easier and less expensive.


THURSDAY, AUGUST 14th (Arrival, Half Day)
West Entrance to Mammoth Hot Springs 

GIBBON FALLS
MUSEUM OF THE NATIONAL PARK RANGER
SILVER GATE
MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS
UNDINE FALLS
BLACKTAIL PLATEAU DRIVE 

At about 1:30pm we stopped in West Yellowstone to rent bear spray and pick up more ice for the cooler before heading into the park. The lines at the west entrance gate were very short and we breezed through in no time, paying at the gate. Knowing Mammoth was our destination, we headed north at Madison junction. Our first stop was for a late lunch at the Gibbon Falls Picnic area, just south of the falls itself, which was a pretty little spot.

GIBBON FALLS:
Our first real stop in the park. We're from Western Oregon...between the Coast Range and the Cascades, we see a lot of waterfalls! This one was very pretty, though. We only did the overlook, but you can hike a trail down, also. It was just a little before 3pm, and it was busy with afternoon crowds. 

MUSEUM OF THE NATIONAL PARK RANGER: 
The rustic cabin it's housed in is one of only three remaining from the time of army occupation (before the NPS was established), and dates from 1908. Here there are wonderful displays about the history of the NPS and a focus on the lives of early park rangers. There were surprisingly few visitors, so we spent quite some time speaking with the interpretive ranger on duty who was happy to share her knowledge with us. The cabin features a rock fireplace and a charming rear deck with interesting burl posts. It's a great place to go if you appreciate the NPS history and the contributions of it's employees.

SILVER GATE:
This otherworldly area just south of Mammoth is really cool! You'll soon see a jumble of huge rocks, known as Hoodoos. These are actually the remnants of an ancient travertine terrace (just like the ones you see at Mammoth) that crumbled and broke apart. We stopped at a pullout to take photos of the rocks and vistas, and there's also a small drive through to the west. It's more of a landscape you drive through versus something you stop and do.

MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS VILLAGE & TERRACES:
We arrived at Mammoth Hot Springs just before 4:30 and decided to do the Upper Terrace Drive as we approached. It looked like being on the surface of the moon! We decided to get checked into our cabin before exploring more. We loved our cabin, and the lobby and map room at Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel are worth visiting even if you're not staying there. After settling in we walked to the gift shop and then to the boardwalks for the Lower Terraces. The whole area is full of interesting features, but the sculptural formations of Minerva Terrace were a real standout, along with Palette Spring. One thing we loved about Mammoth was how easily walkable it was, and the elk were everywhere when we visited. We're used to seeing elk in Oregon, but it was really neat to watch them roam the area while cooking dinner on the front porch of our cabin! After dinner, we decided to go try to spot everything wildlife on Blacktail Plateau Drive, which lies to the east of Mammoth on the Upper Grand Loop.

UNDINE FALLS:
A quick stop. Another pretty falls, this one is at a distance viewed from the overlook.

BLACKTAIL PLATEAU DRIVE:
A six mile scenic drive on a one-way dirt road, this is a nice little drive that gets you off the Grand Loop Road for a bit. We were hoping to spot some wildlife (bears, specifically), but it seemed pretty quiet that evening. We stopped at several pullouts to enjoy the sights and sounds and were rewarded with some stunning light on the rolling hills. I photographed the remnants of a elk skeleton with gorgeous results. It was a peaceful way to end the day before chasing nightfall back to the cabin.


FRIDAY, AUGUST 15th (Full Day #1)
Mammoth Hot Springs to Lake Yellowstone 

CLEARWATER SPRINGS 
ROARING MOUNTAIN 
NORRIS GEYSER BASIN
ARTISTS PAINTPOTS
FIREHOLE CANYON DRIVE
FOUNTAIN FLAT DRIVE
KEPLER CASCADES
WEST THUMB GEYSER BASIN
LAKE LODGE
HAYDEN VALLEY

Woke up at our lovely cabin in Mammoth and made coffee on the porch. Decided to retrace our steps from the previous day and make it a priority to hit Norris Geyser Basin fairly early. I need to explain here that in my ideal version of events, we would be up and going pretty early each morning. I woke up at around 6am naturally every day, but my boyfriend can be slower to get going. This will become a pattern during the trip and did impact our schedule and the amount of things we could fit in, but I also didn't want to force us to rush because feeling rushed on vacation kind of kills the ""relaxation"" component. Which is to say, 3 full days and two half days isn't a huge amount of time to try and cover an area the size of Yellowstone. 

CLEARWATER SPRINGS:
Still getting our bearings and sipping coffee on our drive South from Mammoth, we randomly pulled off at Clearwater Springs just before 9am. It's a pretty little meadow area where Obsidian Creek flows through, mixing with the hot springs there. Not a spot I'd pencil in to any itinerary, but a pretty stop with a small boardwalk and no big crowds.

ROARING MOUNTAIN:
Another small stop, I knew I wanted to check out Roaring Mountain, especially when the steam from the fumaroles on the mountain were still visible in cool morning air. It was a little after 9am when we arrived, and quite a number of folks were already stopped there. The steam was definitely visible, but it wasn't as dramatic as some photos I've seen. It was a quick and easy stop; we were anxious to get on to some of the ""big stuff"", though.

NORRIS GEYSER BASIN:
We arrived at Norris a little after 9:30, and I was relieved to see it wasn't too busy yet. Found parking easily. This is the hottest, oldest hydrothermal area in the park, and also the most acidic. We did the Porcelain Basin boardwalk first, and then the Back Basin one. It's a big area, which I estimate took us about 2 hours to cover. You get a lot of bang for your buck in size and variety of hydrothermal features here. We spent a good 30 minutes walking with a park ranger in the Back Basin; she was super knowledgeable while also being really fun to chat casually with about the various features. I got some gorgeous photos from here, including beautiful shots of Cistern Spring and Emerald Pool, plus some nice steam shots of Steamboat Geyser. Be aware that the area is really wide open, and if it's clear and sunny it will be hot out there. Overall, Norris was a really great stop for our first geyser basin. Lots to see and do...also we're glad we arrived no later than we did, and the parking lot was crazy when we left.

ARTISTS PAINTPOTS:
To the south of Norris, this was a neat area. It's a short walk to the boardwalk from the parking area to a small collection geysers, springs, and mud pots. The variation of colors obviously lends to the name. We only did the boardwalk and decided to not hike up to the Paintpot Hill overlook given that I was getting hungry for lunch. I didn't take a lot of photos here, but the few I got are unique. I'd estimate we spent roughly 30 minutes on the actual boardwalk here. It was worth seeing, but I wouldn't prioritize it at the expense of something else like West Thumb Geyser Basin or Black Sand Basin. 

FIREHOLE CANYON DRIVE:
After stopping for a lunch at the lovely Iron Springs Picnic area just north of Gibbon Falls, we headed south without much of a solid plan. My boyfriend mentioned he was tired after lunch and wouldn't mind just ""laying by a river"" for a bit. I saw the turn for Firehole Canyon Drive and took it, thinking maybe this would fit the bill. Unfortunately, it was about 2pm now and every pullout was packed with people, and I had another driver on my tail that kept me moving. I really don't remember much about the drive, and we never found anywhere to pull over. I thought it would be a leisurely jaunt to avoid the crowds, but apparently not on a warm afternoon in August.

FOUNTAIN FLAT DRIVE:
After our Firehole Canyon misadventure, I thought we could give Fountain Flat a try. There were very few people in the area, bar a few folks setting out on the trails at the end of the parking lot. We did find a place for my boyfriend to take a power nap by the Firehole River, so that was a success. As he napped, I pondered our next move. It was the middle of the day, and I knew we would be heading into the busiest areas of the park (Old Faithful and all the basins around it) and it would be madness to attempt these at the height of the day if we could avoid it. Given the time, I figured it would be best to try and do those on the last two days, when we would be staying at Old Faithful Inn for a night.

KEPLER CASCADES:
We hit Kepler Cascades just after 3pm. It's a pretty waterfall. At this point my boyfriend turned to me and said, ""It's a waterfall... we have plenty at home."" That being said, if you're just a fan of waterfalls or don't get to see them often, it's very pretty. I think we were both most entertained by the chubby, quite brazen chipmunk approaching visitors looking for handouts. We did not indulge him.

WEST THUMB GEYSER BASIN:
After our third waterfall, we were both happy to get back to some geothermal action. West Thumb Geyser Basin did not disappoint! We both found this to be such a a unique experience. The setting of these crystal blue pools against the deeper blue of Lake Yellowstone is stunning, and so are my photos from here. Black Pool, Abyss Pool, and Fishing Cone are some really unique features. It's a relatively small area, but it really packs a punch. It was 3:45pm when we got there, but parking wasn't difficult at all, which was a pleasant surprise to us. Definitely don't miss out on West Thumb! 

LAKE YELLOWSTONE AND LAKE LODGE:
We were staying at Lake Lodge that evening, and we checked into our cabin a little after 5pm. If you read my lodging post, you will see that the Pioneer Cabin at Lake Lodge was our least favorite accomodation. The lodge itself is in a great rustic building with a cafe and gift shop. We got settled into the cabin and discussed a plan for the evening. I wanted to stay around the Lake Yellowstone area, maybe out to the Storm Point Trail. My boyfriend, however, was really itching to see wildlife because up until now it had just been geothermal features and waterfalls. After discussion, it was decided we would drive up to Hayden Valley to try for some evening wildlife spotting.

HAYDEN VALLEY:
We departed Lake Lodge at around 6:30pm. It was a beautiful night for a drive as the heat of the day began to subside. We didn't have to go too far into Hayden before we spotted our first herds of bison! We pulled out at multiple different spots as we drove north and looped back before we got too close to Canyon. My boyfriend got some good use out of his new binoculars spotting birds of prey, along with the bison. We headed back to our sad little cabin at Lake Lodge and heated up some ready made lentil curry with noodles for dinner.


SATURDAY, AUGUST 16th (Full Day #2)
Lake Yellowstone to Tower Roosevelt 

HAYDEN VALLEY
GRAND CANYON, SOUTH RIM
DUNRAVEN PASS
TOWER FALL
LAMAR VALLEY
ROOSEVELT LODGE

Neither of us slept great on our night at Lake Lodge, probably a combination of the adjustment to a double bed and the constant noise from the kids in the cabin next to us. We checked out around 8am and headed north toward Hayden Valley again.

HAYDEN VALLEY:
Our morning drive through Hayden Valley yielded much the same from the night before: bison and birds. The bison herds were much closer to the road than the previous night, and I was able to get some fun action shots of a big guy wallowing in a dust bath.

GRAND CANYON OF THE YELLOWSTONE, SOUTH RIM DRIVE:
We arrived at the South Rim Drive at just around 9am. Crowds were starting to pick up, but we still found parking easily at each stop. And, I have to say, the Yellowstone Falls here is IMPRESSIVE. Feeling somewhat immune to the waterfalls so far, this experience lived up to the hype. We hit every stop along the drive and got some beautiful photos, especially from Artists Point. Nearing the end of our canyon drive, I was starting to realize that my energy was running super low. We had been having sandwiches for lunch the last two days, and for dinner a combination of a vegetable curry and noodles. I felt like I needed something substantial at that point, even if it was just a cheap breakfast. We made an emergency stop at the cafeteria in Canyon Village where I got biscuits and gravy and sausage links. It was absolutely cafeteria level food and overpriced for what it was, but it hit the spot. Both my energy level and my mood improved considerably. My boyfriend was anxious to get up to Lamar Valley, so we headed north from Canyon.

DUNRAVEN PASS:
Being from Oregon, I've driven some crazy roads. Dunraven Pass isn't the craziest I've driven, but I could see how the narrow roads and steep drop offs with no guardrails could be a nail biting experience for folks from the flatlands. The vistas here are expansive and breathtaking. There's not much here for tourist stops, but I encourage you to pull over at a pullout just to take in the scenery.

TOWER FALL:
Yes, another waterfall. This was less impressive than Yellowstone Falls, but more impressive than the others we'd seen. The rock pinnacles and sheer height make it a unique experience, plus it's a great stopping point after driving Dunraven for a bit just to break up the drive. 

LAMAR VALLEY, AFTERNOON: 
We descended into the Tower Junction area at about 11:30am. Far too early to check into our cabin, we decided to head straight out for our first venture into Lamar Valley. We started seeing bison very soon in, lounging and grazing near the giant erratic glacial boulders. We were seeing them nearing the end of their rut season, and they blanketed the valley in places. You could tell the males had paired with females and were keeping a very close eye on them. Here we would get some of our closest encounters, and one in particular where a large male bison was being herded in the opposite lane by a NPS vehicle. I watched as the big guy approached and walked right by my driver's side window, and snapped a very close up photo. It was mixture of exhilaration and terror, to be sure. After the herds thinned out, we stopped at a pullout and walked down to Soda Butte Creek to explore a bit. I think this was the first time I insisted on taking the bear spray we rented a long with us. I have no idea where we actually stopped because it wasn't an official hiking trail or anything, but it was pretty and gave my boyfriend a chance to get away from traffic and people. We then kept driving east, ending up at Warm Creek Picnic Area for lunch. Here there were notices warning of recent bear activity, but we and the others there enjoyed our lunches by the creek without incident (except for a brief afternoon thunderstorm). Not far from there we turned back around and enjoyed the bison herds as we headed back towards Roosevelt Lodge.

ROOSEVELT LODGE: 
We arrived around 3:30pm and spent some time walking around and browsed the little gift shop near the registration area. They have a unique selection of Lamar Valley items as well as huckleberry sweets. We watched a coyote skirt the parking lot, no doubt scavenging for tourist scraps. We soon got checked into our little cabin. My boyfriend was in the mood for a nap, so I took some time to do some reading and journaling. We decided we'd like to head back out into Lamar in the evening after a light dinner at the Roosevelt Lodge Dining Room.

LAMAR VALLEY, EVENING:
We headed back out into Lamar Valley around 6pm. Skies had been somewhat darkened by earlier thunderstorms. The bison were still plentiful, and we spotted some more birds of prey, coyotes, and the usual suspects. On our way back, we noticed people pulled off to the sides of the road. After stopping, and a quick inquiry, we were directed to two grizzly bears feeding on a bison carcass on the far away hillside. Not easily visible to the naked eye, we traded off using the binoculars to watch. One aspect we liked about roadside wildlife watching was the communal experience and interactions with others it created. It's quite the community of serious wildlife watchers mixed with casual tourists like ourselves, and we met some very knowledgeable folks who were fun to chat with. We made sure to get back to Roosevelt before it was totally dark because I didn't love the idea of dodging animals in the night. We loved our day in Lamar, and neither of us regretted dedicating the time and driving to it. I wish we had more. We settled back into our cozy cabin and lit up the wood stove for the night.

1ncact8,https://i.redd.it/lo8zv7c0p2of1.png,Second part of the unfunny show,"""Yes, and I can feel it too.

Okay, let's hope that ""this"" will end soon,"" I said with hope in my voice and went to the bathroom to shake myself off and wash my hair.

There I discovered that the white grains were apparently sugar grains, because when I started to wash them off, my hair stuck together.



Not understanding how to explain what had happened, we decided that the wisest thing would be to just have breakfast and do the work that awaited me.



""Then, when I will be free, you and I will try to analyze what happened at night,"" I said.



""Okay, Haya! Don't worry! And regarding the breakfast, in my opinion, is a very good decision,"" my son summed up.



I hoped that the strange and delirious things that happened at night would dissipate with the first rays of the sun, as usually happens in science fiction films, and the morning would pass calmly, but I was wrong in my assumptions.



As if some invisible entertainment amuser could not calm down and launched the second part of the unfunny show for us, this time the coffee one.



""Noam, ""it"" is starting again, look, something fell on my hair and on my T-shirt again and it is no longer sugar, now these are some brown grains, it seems similar to coffee!"" I said to my son with alarm.



""Yes, Haya, as far as I can see it is really coffee"" my son noted with curiosity, looking at the brown grains that had somehow appeared on my T-shirt.

""I even sniffed them to make sure that it was definitely coffee, ground coffee. Wow! And it was pouring out of nowhere again, right out of the air and right on you.

And now the same thing is happening that happened last night, only now it's not sugar that's falling on you, but coffee. Wow, it's just fantastic. I didn't even know that was possible,"" Noam added.

""And when I'm among people, everything is fine and nothing happens, but as soon as I move away from them, ""it"" happens again,"" I complained to my son.

Indeed, to do my job, I had to shuttle between the villa, where there were workers and guests, and its courtyard, where there was practically no one and it was as if someone invisible was waiting for me from somewhere above there to pour a small portion of ground coffee on me, which landed on my clothes, my face, my hair.

Some stuff was out of my control and I had to work through and some shit is definitely just about making better choices on what to focus on, what to spend my time on, what thoughts i choose to think. 

Anyway I had a pretty rough period the last year or so and it caused me to fall back into autopilot negative thinking, limited beliefs, etc. Survival mode was triggered due to some life changes and once you‚Äôre in that fear state it can really feel like everything is working against you. Can feel difficult to manifest from a relaxed state when you‚Äôre quite literally in fight or flight.

I recently decided now that stuff is finally falling back into place for me, I had to reset my attitude. I decided to be conscious about my energy and how i was feeling. Literally the day i committed to making a shift back into my higher self, I was planning to go buy myself flowers‚Ä¶.and the exact same day before I left for trader joes I received a bouquet!!! From someone who usually requires a lot of prompting to do anything romantic. So it was like what are the chances of that being a coincidence? Now i didn‚Äôt use any strategies or hope that person would buy me a bouquet. I just had plans to buy flowers for myself and like magic, a bouquet appeared in my 3d without me having to leave my house that day.

I ran out of matcha so i went to the coffee shop and got a free matcha because of the points. Now prior to this, i had nvr figured out how their point system worked and whenever i tried to see what points i had, the link never worked. I had even thought my points had expired but that was the first time i was able to redeem them and i‚Äôve been to this place plenty of times.

The other day I also decided i wasn‚Äôt going to take X amount of time to pay down a credit card that had piled on extensively during my rough season. I decided i was going to pay it off in like less than a quarter of the ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù time frame. The very next day I received an opportunity that would result in a large payment that would propel me a lot closer to my goal of paying off my CC.

I just wanted to share some of the examples that have literally presented in my 3d within only a few dayssss of me deciding that everything works out in my favor, day to day things don‚Äôt have to be as difficult as i tend to make them, and i am open to receiving. 

Hope this can bring much needed encouragement to anyone feeling down about life rn. Even the hard phases are meant to teach us important lessons. I hit rock bottom financially but I know if i didn‚Äôt, i would have carried on the rest of my life with poor money skills. I always knew how to make $ but equated earning it with hard work as if that is the only way. I also only knew 2 things - either save or spend. I didn‚Äôt know how to save AND spend *wisely* and invest. It was tough hitting rock bottom but it set me up for likely way more wealth building in the long run vs. if i had found some bandaid to my problems i wouldn‚Äôt have changed my habits. I was also feeling exhausted from doing it alone so long that i kept hoping someone outside myself would be the avenue to being provided for. I had to remember I have the power to create my own wealth and financial security. I don‚Äôt need to give my power away for someone else to bring any resource into my life when i‚Äôve always been able to do it myself and i can continue to do so and it doesn‚Äôt have to be exhausting. I have the power within me and that was another lesson i needed reminder of. I‚Äôve finally let go of this dream that ‚Äúonce i find a provider man i can relax‚Äù. You can relax when you decide you‚Äôre deserving of a slower / calmer life. You can attract more financial abundance when you decide you deserve it, it doesn‚Äôt have to be some far away destination or something that only comes if you meet a wealthy partner or if you finally get XYZ job or when you‚Äôve saved for 25 years. You can have what you desire sooner than later but you have to decide that it‚Äôs possible.

But it was always informal, as I am already one to never eat breakfast since everything makes me tired unless it's light or fruits.

My boyfriend has done several fasts, up to 3 days long so I was going to try one myself. Ate kind of messy the last day into late night (with even sweets) so started it on Saturday night at about 1:15 AM. Gave myself lots of leeway; taking it an hour at a time, where anything over 18 hours I would have been happy with.

I had a bit of a rough time on day one, gnarly headache, hunger, the whole nine yards - but rode it out with 1 beef bouillon made into a broth and some salt after researching more about fasting.  That helped with the headache. Day 1 was also rough as I had to work and I work with food; so half the day I was going crazy especially around my usual eating time. Once the headache broke later that night; I got a nice surge of energy and was determined to see how long I could go.

Day 2 was much better. Sleep was a little fitful, I woke up a bunch of times and had some pretty strange dreams. When waking I had less of a headache than I normally do in the mornings, took some black coffee with water, and my water with a little mio for energy as I'm normally a caffeine addict. No food. No calories. I felt great throughout most of the day but got a little winded when cleaning; so did more computer work and relaxed. In the late afternoon I noticed cold hands, and hunger again, a bit of very light dizziness, but nothing I couldn't manage. I was surprised how well I was doing and gave myself permission to break the fast at any time I needed - but still persisted one hour at a time. My return food is waiting in the fridge, ready and waiting.

It's now been almost 47 hours; and I can't believe that I'm managing it so well. I always grew up on the whole we need food, eat a good dinner, etc. And here I'm a beginner doing a multi - day pretty clean fast with minimal issues.

I'm female, almost 49 years old, in menopause (fasting I found out is the best hot flash cure); with mood swings that scare me (which also have reduced a little). Fasting is helping with so much of that too, it's amazing. I didn't really check my exact weight loss as I'm primarily doing this for health and longevity reasons, the weight loss is a bonus yet I can tell I've lost at least a little.

So all in all:

No food; lots of water (plain), water with 0 calorie flavors (mio), salt, 1 bullion into a broth per day in the evenings, coffee with extra water in it; headache medicine if I need it. I'm likely to break the fast sometime between hour 48 and tomorrow sometime depending on how I feel as I'm worried about returning to work on Wednesday before I reintroduce my system to food again and don't want my first fast to last longer than 48 - 72 hours.

Just wanted to share my experience and get a little feedback if I did it right. Is my experience common in that it's easier with day 2? What might happen when I get off this fast, anything I need to be aware of? By the time you answer I might have already resumed eating, so I'd also love to know if there any other things I can do next time to be better prepared?

1nc9xyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1nc9xyo/girlfriend_has_bpd_i_am_not_sure_how_to_approach/,"Girlfriend has BPD, I am not sure how to approach an issue","I [22M] have been with my girlfriend [21F] for little under a year now. She has been diagnosed with BPD few months after we got together and has been managing it really well - she has medication from her psychiatrist and attends therapy regularly. Overall, she has put in a lot of effort to get her diagnosis under control and she has been doing really well - she can regulate her emotions and communicates really well.

For the year or so, we have not run into any substantial issues and the relationship has been very fulfilling as well as pleasant. As a matter of fact, she has been an absolutely amazing girlfriend and her diagnosis never posed any issues. However, yesterday evening she turned into a completely different person in the matter of minutes and I am unsure how to approach this.

The issue is as follows: On the weekend we are supposed to travel abroad to visit a city in a neighbouring country. Her parents are supposed to meet us there, too. (They live abroad but over the year I have already met them several times on different occassions). The thing is, that one of my university classmates /(Female) also lives in the city and I made plans to go grab a coffee with her. For context we are arriving on Saturday, then in the afternoon me and my girlfriend will split up - I will visit the said friend and my gf will hang out with her parents. In the evening, the four of us are planning to have dinner togerther.

Initially everything was alright, my GF did point out that she is not 100% happy with my decision to visit a friend instead of being with her and her parents, but because it is a rare occassion for me to see the classmate and I am joining my GF and her parents in the evening, she is okay with it. At the same time, as she was describing how the situation is not ideal for her, she let me know that she does not want to be a controlling girlfriend and that my ask is completely reasonable.

So far so good, but then, suddenly, something switched yesterday evening. She confessed, that she is absolutely not happy with my decision to join my friend. The problem seems to be the following:

She has these negative emotions about our meeting

She logically understands that me meeting a friend that lives in a specific city abroad is reasonable

Because of this she would also feel very uncomfortable if she had to order me not to meet her as she would feel as a bad partner

She feels that her only options thus are: let me meet her and feel uncomfortable because of that, or ask me not to meet her and feel uncomfortable because she will feel controlling

The issue then stems from this perception that no matter what she does, she will feel negative, which she told me makes her feel really stressed and anxious. I understand that the brain of a person with BPD functions differently and I can see why being stuck with only two options that are both uncomfortable is rising her anxiety through the roof.

It then sort of escalated from there, she told me that, as her brain perceives me as the source of this absolutely horrible situation, she does not want to be close to me. She has suggested we do the trip separately and has asked me to sleep in the kitchen yesterday if possible. Unfortunately, we are both working full-time so me sleeping on a mattress in the kitchen felt unreasonable and so I declined and explained my point of view. I offered her to sleep in the kitchen if she feels uncomfortable in my presence.

Based on her words, she currently feels the love for me has dissappeared as she now has this negative connotation with me, although she understands that it is not logically based and is not acting on it. At the same time, she has explained, that because she was put in this unfortunate position by my existence she does not feel she likes me anymore, does not like our flat anymore, does not like the idea of travelling this weekend anymore and just overall feels like she would prefer that the whole situation just dissappears (as she does not see a solution that would be acceptable).

My question to those for you who have experience with BPD or partners with BPD, can you advice me on how to procced in this case? I want to make her feel as comfortable as possible, but I also do not see an easy way out. Is there something specific I can do to help her manage this? Maybe some way to effectively communicate with her that everything is going to be alright? Or is a better solution to give her space now and let her figure it out on her own? Tbh, I am completely lost as what to do, but still want to be a partner that she can rely on in these difficult situations. Any advice is highly appreciated, thank you!",3,1757393418.0,BPDlovedones,4,1.0,False

Log 038 of the reconnaissance mission.

This has been another boring day.

When they told me I‚Äôd be part of a reconnaissance mission through an unexplored region of the galaxy, I expected a little excitement.

Instead, most of the time we‚Äôre just on the ship, traveling from one place to another.

Sometimes we come across a planet with the right conditions for landing, that‚Äôs more exciting.

Unfortunately, it almost always turns out the planet is basically a desert on a planetary scale, with nothing worthwhile.

We just take a few samples, go back to the ship, and leave.

Every now and then we spot blue planets with vast oceans, but we were told to investigate solid surfaces, so‚Ä¶

There‚Äôs very likely life on those oceanic planets, there almost always is.

But it‚Äôs probably just fish or some animal; intelligent life is extremely rare in the cosmos.

How many intelligent species have we discovered so far? Five? Six?

Out of those six, three or four are still in the stone or bronze age, so there‚Äôs not much to do.

The council asked us not to interfere with those kinds of species; no one wants to do the space equivalent of ‚Äúhanding a shotgun to a monkey.‚Äù So we keep our distance.

As for the other intelligent species, I think only one reached the stars and keeps an equal relationship with us.

What were they called? The Beetles? No idea, bug people.

They‚Äôre stubborn as rocks, but they don‚Äôt want to start a war. Neither do we. So we just make contact every now and then to trade some things, and then everyone goes their own way.

It‚Äôs not how I imagined humanity‚Äôs journey through space, but it‚Äôs still better than the dark forest theory.

Anyway, I don‚Äôt remember what I was going to do today.

‚Äî‚ÄúAnna! What were we going to do today?‚Äù

From the ship‚Äôs barracks, a familiar voice answers my cry for help.

‚Äî‚ÄúDid you forget again? You‚Äôre a terrible captain, Nanna.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúOh come on, I‚Äôm not that bad! Now, will you tell me where we‚Äôre going?‚Äù

Anna comes walking in, wearing pajamas and holding a cup of coffee. When she reaches the cabin, she sits in the copilot‚Äôs seat, her gaze lost in the stars outside the window.

‚Äî‚ÄúKOI113‚Ä¶ No idea, the name‚Äôs too long. All we‚Äôve got about that planet is a picture, looks like a giant forest.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúFinally, something that isn‚Äôt a desert!‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs why we brought an anchor.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúWhat? We have one of those?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúYeah, the council thinks this planet might be habitable, so they want a direct route to it.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúThat‚Äôs promising.‚Äù

Excited, I pushed the lever that marks the ship‚Äôs speed. Now I actually want to reach that planet.

‚Äî‚ÄúHow far is it?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúPretty far, it would take about‚Ä¶ 150 years to get there, I think?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúThat long? Seriously? What a drag.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôll be a long trip.‚Äù Anna takes a good sip of her coffee, taking her time to drink it all before continuing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to go back into cryosleep soon.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the rush? There are so many things we could do!‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúIn this little ship?‚Äù Anna looks around us, paying special attention to the pipes running along the vehicle‚Äôs inner walls. ‚ÄúNo, there‚Äôs not much to do.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúOf course there is, we could‚Ä¶ you know, play with Carrot!‚Äù

She raised her hand, pointing at the ship‚Äôs third cryosleep tank. Inside it, a rabbit slept peacefully.

It‚Äôs sooo cute. I can‚Äôt wait to reach that planet and finally give him a much-deserved walk. The little guy has literally been waiting centuries for that moment.

‚Äî‚ÄúTapping the glass of a cryosleep capsule as if it were some kind of fish tank isn‚Äôt exactly my idea of fun, Nanna.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúOh no? Then we can play Space Chess!‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúI won‚Äôt play with you, you‚Äôre a cheater.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúAccording to who? They only say that because I always win!‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúBy default. You always win by default, everyone quits once they find out you peek at the cards.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúTheir fault for not hiding them.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúYeah, yeah, whatever‚Ä¶‚Äù

With some annoyance, Anna made her empty cup float over to a nearby table. The magnets on its underside latched onto those on the table, keeping it firmly in place.

Right, Anna has a psycho-link. It‚Äôs one of those things you‚Äôd expect to see doing something amazing, but in practice it‚Äôs only ever used to‚Ä¶ move cups. Strong psychics are rare in the galaxy, even more so those who can generate specific phenomena like levitation or fire-starting.

Damn, I‚Äôve worked in this company for many years and never once saw a single pyrokinetic.

I‚Äôll never waste my valuable credits on something as stupid as a psycho-link. Totally not worth it.

‚Äî‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to bed.‚Äù Anna stood up from her seat, stretched a little, and then began walking toward her cryosleep capsule.

‚Äî‚ÄúAw. What? And the Space Chess?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúGood night, Nanna. Wake me up when we arrive.‚Äù

Anna entered the capsule, waving her hand in farewell before it closed and let cryosleep do its work.

‚Äî‚ÄúUgh‚Ä¶ fine‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll play alone.‚Äù

. . .

Actually‚Ä¶ there isn‚Äôt much to do here.

I just spin in my chair for a while, waiting for something to happen.

Since obviously nothing happens, I have nothing better to do than stare into the vastness of space.

Do you know the phrase ‚Äúgaze into the abyss, and the abyss gazes back at you‚Äù?

Well, in outer space, that phrase takes on another meaning.

There‚Äôs an infinity of lights all around me and yet everything is so‚Ä¶ dark. Among nebulas, stars, and planets, countless figures take shape in the immensity before me.

It‚Äôs a beautiful landscape, one I love to behold.

And yet, there‚Äôs no joy in spending my time watching it if there‚Äôs no one to share it with.

With a sigh, I stand up and walk toward my ice coffin.

The ship will wake me when the time comes, so I can rest in peace. It would be amazing if there were a faster way to travel through space, but nothing can be done without an EPR anchor.

The capsule closes, and that horrid sensation takes over me.

I‚Äôve never liked these things. The feeling of cold creeping down my spine unsettles me more than I can bear.

It‚Äôs like the claws of death crawling up to my neck before stealing away my sight.

There‚Äôs no pain. In just a few seconds, the sensation of cold vanishes, and I lose the ability to move along with my vision. By this point, I can‚Äôt breathe anymore. I choke for a few seconds, and then‚Ä¶

---

I wake with a jolt. The ship is landing on our destination planet, and my capsule reanimates me.

I‚Äôm still choking, holding my breath as the black spots fade from my eyes and my fingers begin to move.

When the capsule opens, the first thing I do is leap onto my seat, desperate for air, letting out small, strangled gasps.

I hate this. I hate it, and I always will.

I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm the only one with this problem.

Nobody gets what this feels like‚Äîat least not the way I feel it.

If they felt even a fraction of what I do, they‚Äôd understand why I want to avoid these damn capsules as much as humanly possible.

I try to step out of the capsule, and the ship‚Äôs warm floor welcomes me.

Right, dormant muscles‚Äînormally you‚Äôre supposed to stay inside the capsule for three or four minutes before trying to stand.

With difficulty, I manage to steady myself on the floor.

Despite the impact, I don‚Äôt feel the slightest pain.

My whole body feels light yet stiff, like forcing a joint to move.

I stay there, sitting on the floor for a while as my body regains its warmth, aided by the ship‚Äôs blessed ventilation.

Ah‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs the pain.

Damn, I hit myself pretty hard.

With trembling legs, I manage to stand and walk to my companion‚Äôs capsule.

Anna rests in the ice with a smile on her face. I wonder what you‚Äôre dreaming about‚Ä¶

I‚Äôll have to ask.

As captain, my capsule is the only one with automated awakening. I‚Äôm expected to be the first to check the situation and decide whether or not to wake the other crew members.

Of course, it‚Äôs nonsense on a trip with just two people and a rabbit.

I place my hand on the sensor and after a few seconds, I hear a soft confirmation beep, starting my companion‚Äôs awakening.

So, we‚Äôve arrived. The forest planet we only know from a photograph.

I stretch with excitement, walking toward the ship‚Äôs cockpit.

When I arrive, I see the systems worked perfectly: a shield had extended over the window glass, blocking the view.

That‚Äôs there to protect our eyes‚Äîengineers thought of everything.

Still, I want to see the landscape.

I place my hands on the ship‚Äôs control panel, switching the defense system from total blackout to a tinted glass that will protect my eyes from the light.

The shutters open, revealing the landing zone.

It looks like some kind of meadow with sea-green grass.

Everything feels so‚Ä¶ peaceful.

It‚Äôs relaxing and fills me with excitement‚ÄîI‚Äôm dying to set foot outside this tin can of a spaceship.

‚Äî‚ÄúAre we there already?‚Äù

My companion asks with a hint of confusion.

‚Äî‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôve been here a while. Sleep well?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúWonderful. How about you?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúHorrible. I don‚Äôt understand how you can smile inside that thing.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ forgot to take a breath before going in again, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. I don‚Äôt ever want to use it again.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll make sure to clean up your skeleton when we get back home‚Äîif it‚Äôs not dust by then.‚Äù

Anna stands up, struggling not to collapse as her muscles loosen.

She lifts her gaze, smiling at me. ‚Äî‚ÄúSo? Are we going to explore or not?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúFinally! Oh, right. The scan.‚Äù

No matter how habitable a planet looks, the truth is we can‚Äôt lower our guard for a second.

Some worlds have atmospheres that offer zero protection from their suns, others are filled with poisonous gases.

With a few gestures, I activate the ship‚Äôs scanner to determine if this planet is suitable for human life.

After a few seconds, the ship beeps as a series of statistics appears on the screen.

We won‚Äôt die from taking a walk.

I turn to look at my companion. She smiles, then turns and starts walking toward the ship‚Äôs exit.

We‚Äôre probably the first humans to ever set foot on this land. It‚Äôs a great honor‚Äîone I gladly accept.

The door opens and a wave of fresh air floods the ship. The scent is sweet, like a field of flowers.

Anna steps out first, still wearing her pajamas.

The air is cool, with a strong, steady breeze that gives the place a cozy feeling. Anna‚Äôs hair dances in the wind as she walks a few meters away from the ship.

‚Äî‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so beautiful!‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs a pleasant place.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you coming out? Come on, stretch your legs!‚Äù

I smile, a little hesitant. This will be the first time in over 200 years that I set foot outside the ship.

A small step for humanity‚Äîand a great relief for me.

Ah, I‚Äôm not wearing shoes.

The grass feels strange‚Äîcool and ticklish. A sensation I haven‚Äôt felt in a very long time, not even back in my hometown.

It‚Äôs nice.

‚Äî‚ÄúHey! Didn‚Äôt you want to give Carrot a walk?‚Äù

Right!

I turn back toward the ship and approach the capsule where our pet rests.

The poor thing looks lost as she wakes up.

I wait a few minutes while her eyes adjust and her muscles loosen.

Gently, I lift her in my arms and step outside again, letting the warm sunlight shine over me and my little ball of fur.

. . .

Something‚Äôs missing.

I raise my head, scanning my surroundings.

I don‚Äôt see Anna anywhere.

A chill runs down my spine as I wonder if it was too soon to leave the ship.

Quickly, I start running across the area, trying to find any trace of my friend.

Circling the ship, I finally see her standing near a strange creature.

It looks like some kind of tree, but it‚Äôs clearly alive‚Äîit moves cautiously, analyzing the situation.

‚Äî‚ÄúAnna?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. This guy doesn‚Äôt seem aggressive.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so sure. Come here.‚Äù

At first, Anna doesn‚Äôt move a muscle, but slowly she begins to step back, careful not to make any sudden moves.

Unfortunately for us, the creature advances as she retreats.

Anna stops, reevaluating the situation.

‚Äî‚ÄúNanna‚Ä¶ get a weapon.‚Äù

No more words needed.

I turn and head back into the ship.

There, I set Carrot down and grab the security weapon we‚Äôre required to carry on our missions.

Armed, I step outside again and approach Anna, raising the weapon toward the beast.

‚Äî‚ÄúStep aside.‚Äù

Anna shifts slightly, giving me room to strike.

Without hesitation, I pull the trigger.

The shot is fast, a beam of light my eyes barely catch before it slams into the living tree, causing massive damage.

Wood splinters fly as the creature staggers back, apparently in pain.

After a few seconds, the alien collapses to the ground, defeated.

Easy. Too easy. All thanks to the beautiful weapons of my homeland.

I place my hand on the side of the weapon and pull.

The gun opens, releasing an empty casing that drops at my feet.

So yes, there are life forms on this planet aside from plants‚Äîduly noted.

Cautiously, I approach the beast to examine it.

This thing doesn‚Äôt seem to have blood. It didn‚Äôt spill a single drop despite now having a hole clean through it.

It‚Äôs made of wood‚Äîcompletely made of wood.

Okay. So it‚Äôs a plant-based life form. Rare in the galaxy, but I‚Äôd heard stories of similar beings on other worlds. Usually they were small or simple, mostly incapable of leaving the place where they were rooted. But this one‚Ä¶

It looks like its roots evolved to function as legs. Maybe it feeds by sitting in water or something similar.

But how does everything else work?

Alien biology always fascinates me. It‚Äôs so strange and makes me ask so many questions. Seeing firsthand something that would normally seem like magic, yet knowing there‚Äôs an entire system created from nothing‚Äîjust like Earth life. Just like me.

I don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôm just rambling here. I should probably take a few samples and make sure there aren‚Äôt more of these things around.

‚Äî‚ÄúNanna.‚Äù

I turn my head to see my companion, who is backing away step by step.

‚Äî‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúThat thing moved.‚Äù

In disbelief, I look back at the beast at my feet. Sure enough, it‚Äôs regaining movement.

I step back, raising my weapon, ready to fire.

How the hell is it still alive!? It has a hole the size of a head through it!

The creature rises with abnormal speed, catching me off guard. It‚Äôs as if it did it specifically to surprise me‚Äîas if it had been pretending ever since it took the shot.

Its clumsy movements vanish, replaced by erratic behavior. It jumps from side to side, forcing me to move just to keep it in my sights.

I pull the trigger, releasing a beam of light that burns into my retinas before slamming into the grass. The tree moved‚Äîthe bastard had been waiting for that shot.

I yank the weapon‚Äôs side open in a rush to eject the spent casing. In that instant, the creature leaps, putting several meters between us before sprinting behind the ship.

I raise the weapon, on guard, waiting for the moment it emerges from hiding so I can blast it to pieces.

Unfortunately, that moment never comes.

After a full minute of waiting, I realize I made a mistake.

I move to the side to check behind the ship‚Äînothing.

Looking up a bit more, I see the tree running comically toward the horizon.

That thing‚Äîdespite being essentially a walking stick‚Äîis surprisingly fast.

I‚Äôm sure I can‚Äôt catch it. I couldn‚Äôt even beat it in a race with a head start.

‚Äî‚ÄúAnd there go the samples‚Ä¶‚Äù Anna comments beside me.

‚Äî‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you stop it?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúOh sure, let me use my graaand psychic powers to crush it, of course.‚Äù Anna waves her hands for emphasis.

‚Äî‚ÄúUgh‚Ä¶‚Äù

Defeated and frustrated, I head back inside the ship to store the weapon in its case.

As I do, I feel a ball of fur bump against my leg.

Right, I was going to give Carrot a walk‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt feel safe doing that with walking trees out there.

‚Äî‚ÄúWant me to write the report?‚Äù my friend asks as she boards the ship.

‚Äî‚ÄúSure, thanks. You hungry?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúYeah, I could go for some roasted rabbit.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúShh! Don‚Äôt say that, you‚Äôll scare the emergency rations.‚Äù

We both laugh before continuing with our duties.

Anna heads for the ship‚Äôs controls, sitting down and bringing up the holographic display to write the day‚Äôs report.

As for me, I go into the barracks and head for one of the shelves, looking for something to eat.

‚Äî‚ÄúAnna, do you know where the vacuum-packed sandwiches are?‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúWe ran out yesterday. Oh right‚Äîabout 100 years ago, give or take.‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúSo we only have‚Ä¶ nutrient paste left‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äî‚ÄúBon app√©tit. Bring me some too.‚Äù

My frustration multiplies as I grab one of those cans filled with tasteless sludge. So many delicacies hidden across the universe, and here we are, forced to eat this garbage.

Lousy cryosleep, no walk for my pet, fighting an alien, and having to eat this stuff. Without a doubt, one of my worst trips. I guess the pleasant grass outside makes up for it a little.

I step out of the barracks with a couple of cans in hand, sit in the copilot‚Äôs seat, and hand one to my companion.

Together, we share a very unimpressive breakfast as we watch this planet‚Äôs sunset.

I was mostly trying to make espresso-like coffee (more of a concoction, not real espresso), and honestly, it wasn‚Äôt that great since AeroPress isn‚Äôt meant for that.

Now I‚Äôm thinking of getting a proper machine. I checked out:

Agaro Imperial (~‚Çπ10‚Äì11k)

Vantro X1 (~‚Çπ7.9k, maybe ~‚Çπ7k during the sale)

HiBrew H10A (a bit more expensive)


Since I‚Äôm not a regular coffee drinker, I just want to start with something cheaper for now. If I really get into it, I‚Äôll invest in a better one later.

I also heard Agaro has terrible customer support if something goes wrong. Can anyone share how Vantro‚Äôs support is in case of issues?

So, is the Vantro X1 worth buying at around 7k, or should I skip and wait to buy a better machine in the future?",3,1757393163.0,IndiaCoffee,8,0.81,False

We‚Äôre looking for those who can and are willing to meet up in person. If that‚Äôs not something you‚Äôre open to, this probably isn‚Äôt the space for you and that‚Äôs okay.

This server is preferably for lesbians aged 28 and up, or anyone who feels older than their age. If you‚Äôre emotionally mature, not into drama, and just want a peaceful space to connect, create, and be yourself, this might be for you.

This is NOT a dating server. It‚Äôs for those of us who:

‚Ä¢ Want real-life friendships, not just fleeting online chats

‚Ä¢ Are open to meeting up in person: coffee, tea, books, arts and crafts, food trips, sports, or simply hanging out

‚Ä¢ Enjoy being creative and productive: art, writing, reading, cooking, or anything you love building

‚Ä¢ Crave a small, respectful, and intentional circle of lesbians who are here for something meaningful

It doesn‚Äôt matter where you‚Äôre from, as long as you‚Äôre willing to connect with sincerity and show up with kindness. We don‚Äôt tolerate disrespect.

## What is Axiron Bit?

Axiron Bit is a **crypto trading platform** that uses automation and real-time data to help users make smarter trades. It‚Äôs designed for both beginners and experienced traders, which is rare‚Äîyou usually get platforms that are either too simple or way too complex.

At its core, Axiron Bit offers **automated trading tools**, real-time market analysis, and multi-asset trading capabilities. Think of it like a personal trading assistant that doesn‚Äôt sleep. The platform uses algorithms to analyze market trends and suggest moves, and you can either go full-auto or trade manually.

What makes it stand out is that it doesn‚Äôt just focus on crypto‚Äîit also supports **forex, commodities, and stocks**. So if you‚Äôre looking to diversify your portfolio, this could be a solid hub.

## Who Created Axiron Bit?

There‚Äôs not a ton of easily available info about the exact team behind Axiron Bit, which at first raised a small red flag for me. But from what I could gather, it follows a similar model to platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**, which are often developed by fintech professionals and backed by third-party brokers.

Based on the smooth user experience and high-functioning backend, it‚Äôs clear that **some serious developers were involved**. The whole thing feels polished and stable‚Äînot something you‚Äôd expect from a fly-by-night operation.

That said, I always recommend using platforms like this with some caution. Not knowing the founders doesn‚Äôt automatically mean it‚Äôs a scam, but it‚Äôs something to keep in mind when deciding how much to invest.

### [üî• Start Trading with Axiron Bit Today](https://tinyurl.com/2cu5r99b)
## How Does Axiron Bit Work?

Axiron Bit runs on a mix of **AI-powered algorithms** and user-defined settings. You can either let the platform trade on your behalf (automated mode) or use it as a tool to make better manual trades. It pulls data from live markets and reacts faster than any human can.

- You sign up and deposit funds.

You also get visual charts, trend indicators, and market sentiment tools, which are super useful if you‚Äôre trying to understand what‚Äôs about to happen next.

### User-Friendly Interface

It‚Äôs clean. It‚Äôs intuitive. I didn‚Äôt need a manual or a YouTube tutorial to figure things out. All major functions are clearly labeled, and even the more advanced tools have **hover-over tooltips** to explain what they do.

This makes it especially great for people who are just starting out but don‚Äôt want to feel dumb using a complex platform.

## Is Axiron Bit a Scam?

From everything I‚Äôve tested, **Axiron Bit doesn‚Äôt show any major red flags**. It works, it pays out, and it provides the tools it promises. That said, this is still a trading platform, and **there‚Äôs always risk involved** when investing.

Here‚Äôs what gives it credibility:

Just remember: **don‚Äôt invest more than you can afford to lose**. That‚Äôs true for any platform.

- Bank transfer
- Some e-wallets (depending on your country)

## Axiron Bit Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7**, and they actually respond quickly. I tested the live chat feature and got help in under 2 minutes. Email support is a bit slower, but still decent.

## The Verdict

1nc9ker,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nc9ker/it_was_supposed_to_be_a_prank_but_then_everyone/,"It Was Supposed To Be A Prank, But then Everyone Started Dying","I am a fiend for all things horror. Can you blame me? Movies like The Shining or Nightmare on Elm Street make my situation seem laughable in comparison. Horror ends up being how I spend just about all of my downtime: books, movies, YouTube, podcasts‚Ä¶ However it might be consumed, I consume it. My name is Jacoby, and while I'm not a seven-foot-tall goth babe, I am a guy who particularly enjoys Creepcast.¬†

Last summer, the hosts of Creepcast announced they would be holding live shows, and I knew I would be there. I had been living near Los Angeles at the time, so I bought my ticket to see their show in LA on Halloween night. I took my seat, and after not very long, the hosts, Hunter and Isaiah, took their seats on stage. The show began with their reading of Anansi's Goatman. Just before getting started with the second story, Hunter began introducing the legendary Ari Aster as a guest speaker, and I just about lost my mind. My favorite director doing a surprise show with my favorite podcast, I was ALL IN. After the audience erupted in applause, he revealed he was just pulling our leg. I couldn't believe how hard I fell for that, though. I got a chuckle out of it, sure, but at the same time, I thought, ""Wow, someone has got to get them back for that."" I'm pretty sure everyone gets intrusive thoughts, but that thought really hit me hard and stuck. It just kept nagging and nagging in the back of my mind, ""Someone has got to get them back for that."" Not so much in a retribution-seeking sort of way, but in the kind of way you always want to pull a prank on pranksters. (Mostly) harmless fun. It eventually hit me. How incredible would it be to give them the scare of a lifetime? And once the idea was had, it planted roots and demanded realization.

To this end, I moved to Salem, Kentucky. It may seem an odd choice coming from the sprawling cities of California, but Salem is nearly the exact midpoint between the homes of the two hosts. Due to the lack of an extant social life and the incredibly modest price of the house I found, leaving my home in California was of very little consequence to me. My new place in Salem was modest, but it had an enormous detached garage--perfect for my little 'workshop of terrors.' The plan was to create an array of devices and tools that could scare anyone while keeping it as mobile and as easy to set up as possible. I set up my workspace with my soldering iron, my 3d printer, a large whiteboard, and enough caffeine to get a coke addict to kick the habit. I ordered nearly ten thousand dollars worth of materials, electronics, and specialized tools. I'd probably go full 'Scooby-Doo' with a monster suit if not for Isaiah's propensity for firearms. So, I brainstormed for some time and had some excellent ideas. After spending a week settling in, I got started building. Each device I crafted was a thing of creative genius, and soon, these pieces of art would work in concert to turn any landscape into the setting of a true horror film. When all is said and done, my mental terrors will render Russ McKamey's scares almost endearing--more akin to a hug at a cancer support group than something meant to terrify.¬†

When I had built satisfactory prototypes, it was time to set forth on the Hunter/Isaiah probe. I hesitated here slightly‚ÄîI'm a weird guy, sure, but I'm no stalker. Yet, here I was, planning on being just that. But how else was I supposed to figure out when to make my move? While I respect they have a right to privacy, it is nothing more than a means to an end. It's not like I'm trying to steal anything from them, well, aside from their peace of mind. Plus, what they don't know won't hurt them. Getting my foot into their digital doors took some time, but it was still quite easy. With up-to-date tools and a little know-how, streaming becomes something like an open house party. I collected their IPs, found their locations, and gave them each a little visit. Depending on how protected the users keep their networking habits on any given device, if you can get the device connected to a network you are running, you can gain immense control and access to an ungodly amount of information. So when I visited each host, disconnected their internet, and set up networks with the same names as their own, it was just a matter of time until I landed the connection. I had lived in Salem for about 3 months by the time I had infiltrated both of their phones. Once I was in, though, I could plan my prank from the little comfort of my Salem home. About 2 months later, I had built, rebuilt, and improved each weapon in my arsenal.

Then, finally, the information I had been waiting for came through. It was almost too good to be true. Youtubers Nick Crowley and Ryan (Nexpo) have a channel they share where they go to famously haunted locations to try and make contact with the ghosts purportedly haunting the place. They reached out to Hunter and Isaiah to be guests on an upcoming episode that will be filmed in about three weeks. The location: Dudley Town, Connecticut. The most famously haunted plot of woods in all of New England. I bought a van, loaded it with every device and tool I might need, and made my way to the Hitching Post Country Motel, which would become my home base until the big night. I needed time to orchestrate every detail, prepare robust contingency plans and their backups, and ensure everything was perfectly camouflaged and working as expected.

Hidden beneath a canopy of the trees are the remains of the deserted Dudley Town. It is private property, monitored just enough to discourage daytime trespassers. This minimal surveillance meant that, come nightfall, there would be nothing‚Äîno wandering hikers, no security‚Äîto interrupt my plans. You'll find mostly stoney remains of foundations and hearths. A few root cellars, a stone well, and a hell of a lot of trees. I would spend the daytime hours either in my motel room, planting seeds of weariness via cryptic messages sent to my victims, or in my van, crafting each device's camouflage and ensuring any inner mechanical movements wouldn't be audible. Then, in the dead of night, I would make my way over to Dudley Town. I would park my van on a dark road far away from prying eyes, wearing all black, with my tools and equipment in a utility cart, and walk the rest of the way there. Most everyone who lives on Bald Mountain Road, which provides the easiest access to Dudley Town, is very old and falls asleep rather early. Still, I made sure to cover my tracks, be as quiet as possible, and park far enough away that no one would notice the headlights. Every step I took in those woods felt heavy and offensive to the silence. It filled me with a heady mix of adrenaline and unease that both unnerved and excited me. And each night, I would set up my devices in new spots, building up the amount of space I could effectively build dread.¬† With each passing day, my plans were becoming reality, and the anticipation for the big day grew.

One evening, after darkness had fully consumed the day, I set off into the woods as usual. I had only a few days left to set everything up. The night air felt almost sentient, heavy with expectancy. I found the device that hadn't been behaving as expected the previous night, then arranged my tools meticulously at the base of the tree to which I had attached the device. My mission felt like the only thing keeping me anchored in reality in that vast, dark expanse. I set to work despite the gnawing tension coiling in my stomach. As I tested the device with my multimeter, it sputtered‚Äîa tiny spark emitted, briefly illuminating the surrounding gloom. I paused, thinking I heard someone whisper to me in the commotion. For an agonizingly long moment, the forest seemed to hold its breath. The wind, usually whistling through the trees, stood still, and the buzz of insects evaporated. I made to continue troubleshooting, but I struggled to focus on the task at hand. Each second stretched interminably, the darkness deepening around me until even my heartbeat felt painfully loud.¬† ""This isn't a fucking Edgar Allan Poe story,"" I tried to reassure myself. Yet, an unsettling sensation churned in my stomach, urging me to look up.¬†

As I did, I saw a ghostly, pale figure standing silently among the trees, a young woman with antlers sprouting grotesquely from her head. Her skin was unnaturally white, and thick rivulets of blood dripped steadily down from her ears, horns, and mouth, pouring off her face in a macabre display. Her hollow eyes locked onto mine, and in that frozen instant, terror rooted me to the spot. I stood there, paralyzed by a dread so intense it drowned out every rational thought.¬†

*This isn't real.*¬†

*You're going to die now.*

*You've gone absolutely delusional.*

*You're going to die now.*¬†

*Everything is fine.*¬†

*YOU ARE GOING TO DIE NOW.*

I shut my eyes tight.

Ground yourself, Jacoby. None of this is real; you need to ground yourself‚Ä¶

I started muttering quietly to myself,

""I can feel the dirt on my knees, I can smell the must of wet leaves, I taste fear‚Ä¶

No, no, no, that is not helping!

I can feel cool air on my skin. I can taste the coffee I had earlier. I can smell my own death‚Ä¶¬†¬†

I can feel my life ending. I can taste my decaying tongue. I can smell her rotting flesh‚Ä¶

Now I am become prey, the suffering of worlds.""

I opened my eyes, and when my vision cleared, there was nothing but darkness where that thing stood some 20 feet away. I lowered my gaze to my scattered tools, trying to calm myself down after clearly experiencing a psychotic break.¬†

It was definitely time to call it a night; I wouldn't be able to get any work done in this mental state. As I was packing my tools away, The air became impossibly cold. My trembling breath quickly became visible. I stood up and spun around to find her face just inches away from mine.¬†

Her mouth, in a pout like a baby whose toy had just been ripped away from her grasp, slowly opened, and she started sobbing. Her maw stretched and stretched, her sobbing transforming menacingly into a scream like some demented Shephard tone; I heard the sound of bone cracking as her jaw detached, the flesh at either side of her mouth ripping apart, spraying blood across my face. I fell to my knees, trembling in fear. The only thing I could hear besides the screaming was the impossibly fast and irregular thuds of my blood pounding against my eardrums. For just a second, the screaming stopped and came back twice as loud in the form of the word ""run.""

I did not need to be told twice.¬†

I scurried like a scared dog unable to get traction on a tile floor. My knees gave out every third step, making this feel no different from those nightmares where you just can't run fast enough. I think I made it about fifty feet when I finally got my bearings, just in time for me to kiss a low-hanging branch, and I was knocked out cold.

I have no idea what time it was when I was knocked out, but when I came to, the sky was beginning to lighten up. Dry blood was caked around my nose, and I could feel a few of my teeth were now loose in their sockets. A foul taste of copper stood impossibly thick in my mouth, enough that I began to retch. I stumbled through the branches and fallen leaves; the trees, previously ominous and looming, felt more like silent witnesses to my terror. My body felt as heavy as lead as I struggled my way back to the van. Maybe I had just imagined it, a product of my frayed nerves. I must have just fallen asleep while working and was having a nightmare‚Äîbut I could still feel the raw, suffocating terror in my chest, the cloying fear that had paralyzed me to the core. The scream still rang in my ears... it had all been too real. Yet, the thoughts persisted: It was just a nightmare. You fell asleep and had a nightmare. Nothing more."" My mind spun in circles, desperate to feel grounded. I got back to my motel, washed up, changed my clothes, and found a greasy spoon to get a bit of human warmth, as well as some much-needed sustenance.

Inside the diner, quiet chit-chat is held amongst the few inhabited booths and tables, and the clatter of dishes filled my veins with a sense of safety. I settled into a booth by the window and ordered a coffee and a plate of hash browns, eggs, and bacon. The hot coffee soothed my raw throat; each bite of food felt like a reassuring squeeze on your arm from a loved one. I took my time and savored it. The waiter approached, sleep still in her eyes.

""Can I get you anything else?"" she asked with a gentle smile.

""I'll take a refill on my coffee if you don't mind,"" offering a small, weary smile in return. The waiter nodded, fetched the coffee pot, and filled my mug without further comment. My thoughts felt a little clearer‚Äînot by much, but enough to make last night's events feel like they lie sturdily in the past. I stared out the window, watching old cars drive down the sleepy street outside the diner. The gentle glow of streetlights in the early morning twilight and the steady rhythm of passing cars felt mesmerizingly calming. I allowed myself a brief respite in the view of the townsfolks day-to-day. I stirred my coffee, took the last bite of bacon, and continued reflecting. In the back of my mind, I knew there was only one way forward. Two days. Two days until the big day, and no silly trick of the mind could stop me now. I was so close, and the plan was far too along to abandon. Whatever the hell that thing was, hallucination or not, it didn't matter. Jacoby ain't scared of no ghosts. I would finish what I've started. I threw cash on the table and left with my steely resolve.¬†

I decided to risk being discovered just to get some work done in daylight. As I drove back to Dudley, I felt confident and determined to see this through.¬†

The sun was fully up at this point, and as I neared my destination, something began to feel off.¬†

'It's right behind me,' popped into my head. The hairs on the back of my neck rose. I glanced into the rearview mirror, and she was there. Her pale presence was unnervingly vivid, staring at me with that same awful pout. I felt that same chill from earlier creeping around me; frost consumed the surface of the windows and mirrors. I had started drifting toward oncoming traffic; the blaring horn of a truck forced me to focus on the road and adjust.¬†

""Calm down‚Ä¶ just calm down,"" I muttered nervously. I risked a peek back at the rearview mirror, but it was gone, as was the cold. Just like that, all the peace I had found in the company of others melted away. While I couldn't see her in my van anymore, I could still feel that knot in my stomach telling me she was still watching me.

The woods felt wrong. The sensation of eyes on me was more fueled by my worry of the living seeing me than by‚Äîwell, the uh‚Äî So anyway, I changed the fuse on the malfunctioning device I was attempting to repair the previous night, ran a test, and it was as good as new. Everything was now ready for action. I have a network of speakers and wires flowing through the canopy, several hidden in the scattered hearths, bushes, and debris piles. The thin wires are connected by vibrating motors on one end and the speaker on the other, hidden amongst the top of the trees. It creates a sound you'd never guess could come from a speaker. I have set up cycles of particular sounds on particular wires that, to a person on the ground, might sound like the haunting cries of a child or of a woman screaming bloody murder. It is shrill and haunting, like the gho‚Äî ahem. I've buried several medium-sized motors underground in sound-proof containers under every big clearing one might pitch a tent upon. The trembling effect it causes on the earth feels unsettling, even when you know exactly where it's coming from. God, if only I could recreate that freezing sensation I‚Äî*Focus, Jacoby. Focus.*

I hung 'Blair-Witch' like charms all around the place. Not so obviously that you'd notice them right away, we want to keep this believable after all. 150 pounds of a mixture containing pig blood, water, and anticoagulant that, with a press of a button, will begin flowing down the branches of the trees surrounding the well. Food-grade and non-toxic, of course! The scent dispensers are hidden all about the woods, disguised in miniature ghillie suits. I've planted several cameras and about 30 microphones so that I am able to orchestrate everything from a distance. As you cannot drive directly up to Dudley town, the group will have to leave their vehicles unsupervised. The closest I needed to get to them was within about fifty feet whenever they left and locked their cars. I'll use a special little tool called a Flipper to capture the RF signals used by their car fobs. I will then use that same tool to unlock their car door, pop the hood, and pull either the ignition fuse if they're using gas-powered vehicles or the ECM fuse if it's electric. I'll then put those fuses somewhere inside their cars. This way, I'm not doing any harm to their vehicles, only keeping them from being able to start their vehicles and end the fun too early. After I have accomplished this, I will be spending the rest of the evening running the show from the workstation I set up in the van.¬†

***The day of.***¬†

Nick and Ryan arrived first, joined by their friend and cameraman Justin. I successfully recorded the RF signal for their van and waited for everyone else to arrive.¬†

The Creepcast crew's van rumbled to a stop about an hour later. The late afternoon sun hung low, filtering golden light through the skeletal trees that framed their path. Hunter kicked open his door and stepped out, stretching with a satisfied groan. Followed by Isaiah, Nik, and Jonno. The group fell into step, making their way toward Dudley Town.¬†

Nick, Ryan, and Justin stood near one of the ruins mid-conversation. Nick turned as they approached, raising a hand in greeting.¬†

""Hey! Look who finally decided to show up!""

Hunter smirked, closing the distance between them, and said, ""Oh, sorry, were we supposed to be on time? I thought we were letting you guys soak in the ominous vibes before we got here.""

Ryan exhaled through his nose, crossing his arms. ""Yeah, well, mission accomplished. This place is something else.""

Jonno kicked a loose rock near his boot. ""So, what's the craic? Is this place cursed, crawling with ghosts, or just a sad pile of stones left to rot?""

Ryan shifted his stance. ""It's the kind of place that doesn't hit you right away, but the longer you stand in it, the more you start noticing the way the air sits wrong.""

Isaiah put his hands together and said, ""Well, I don't know about y'all, but I have my crucifix and a 45 loaded with silver bullets. Just in case.""

Nik sighed, shaking his head. ""Well, I'm pretty used to being ghosted, so I think I should be fine.""

Jonno snickered. ""Don't be so hard on yourself‚Äîthere's a chance yet that one of these ghosts will return your message from the beyond!""

Nik placed a hand over his chest. ""I love that you all care so deeply.""

Hunter grinned. ""That's what we're here for, buddy.""

Nick motioned toward the ruins. ""Alright, here's the plan. We will set up all of our tools around the area. We'll start with the cellar and introduce ourselves to the spirits there,"" he said, gesturing toward a dark hole in a wall of stones.

Ryan sighed and said, ""Then,"" with a dramatically long pause, ""the well."" He continued: ""We have another half hour until the sun sets, so let's go ahead and get the cameras started. We will set up a couple of REM-Pods by some of the old hearths. The music box will be just outside the cellar over there, so if anything moves near the entrance, we'll hear it. For the grand finale, we'll lower Nick into the well to do the Estes method.""

Nick brought his hands together and said, ""If I die, monetize my spirit.""

Once they started setting up, I disabled their vehicles and returned to the van. I watched from the monitors as the group shifted into filming mode. Nick and Ryan took position in front of the ruins as Justin framed the shot. Nik stood next to Justin, camera in hand, and Jonno stood back.

Justin spoke, ""Alright, we are now‚Ä¶ rolling""

Ryan squared his shoulders, glancing at Nick before looking directly into the lens. ""Welcome to another episode of Nick and Ryan. We have some very special guests with us today.""

Nick gestured behind him, ""Joining us on this investigation are the guys from Creepcast‚ÄîHunter and Isaiah. You've probably never heard of them.""

Hunter stepped forward, spreading his arms wide. ""I mean, listen, it's a huge honor to be here. Oh, and also, buy Meat Canyon merch!""

Isaiah nodded, giving the camera a serious look. ""Some people dream of meeting their heroes. I dream of getting tackled by a poltergeist.""

Ryan stepped back into the frame and said, ""We are here in Dudley Town, Connecticut, with gracious approval from the Dark Entry Forest Association. The village's location, surrounded by three large hills, results in limited sunlight, leading to its nickname, the Dark Entry Forest. This place was established sometime in the mid-seventeen hundreds by descendants of Edmund Dudley, a British noble who was beheaded for treason. Some have said this is the most haunted place on earth.""

Nick spoke up and said, ""Tonight is the night, guys. I can feel it. Tonight, we are going to get our first full-body apparition. I wanna see hashtag FBA blowing up."" They all continued filming a bit, then one by one dipped into the small root cellar.

I switched to the camera hidden in that cellar.

""We'd just like to open the floor to any spirits that are here tonight. My name is Ryan.""¬†

""My name is Nick.""

""I'm Justin.""

""This is Justin; my name is Nick,"" Nick added again.

""I‚Ä¶ Am‚Ä¶ MEAT CANYON"" Hunter offered.

Isaiah spoke, ""I am the Wendigooner; this is Nik and Jonno.""

""Hi, erm, I'm Winslow,"" added Nik.

""Howya, I'm Jonno. Grand to meet ya.""

Nick tilted his head slightly, scanning the empty space. ""We've heard that people have seen things in this cellar‚Äîshadows, figures standing in the corners. If that's true, we'd love for you to show yourself.""

Hunter contributed with an epic fart that lasted far too long.

""Seriously?"" Justin whispered.

Ryan took a slow step forward. ""You don't have to be afraid of us. If you want, you can knock on something, move something, anything to let us know you're here.""

I couldn't help but smirk. Watching this unfold from behind the scenes was exhilarating. I already knew that this would be the best episode they had ever made. I didn't put any of the scent dispensers directly into the cellar they are in, but I went ahead and activated them all at this time, and on a medium volume, I played the sound of a woman screaming for less than half a second. From within the cellar, it should have just barely been audible.¬†

Justin said, ""Bruh‚Ä¶ did you guys hear that?""¬†

Hunter responded, ""The fuck are you talking about, dude? I didn't hear anything.""¬†

Nick pulled a small twist-cap flashlight from his bag and carefully placed it on the floor, facing up toward the ceiling. He twisted the cap to the point where it could flicker on with just the lightest touch.

""If that was you trying to reach out to us, turn the light on. All you have to do is tap this flashlight.""

Everyone stood completely still.

I leaned forward in my seat, watching the feed closely. The air felt thick with anticipation, even for me.

A moment passed.

Then another.

Ryan exhaled slowly. ""Maybe you don't want to do that one. That's fine. Can you make a noise instead? A knock, maybe?""

Silence.

Isaiah cleared his throat. ""I mean, maybe they're shy. Maybe they need a little more coaxing.""

Ryan nodded. ""Alright, let's make this easier. I'm going to count to three. If you're here, give us a knock.""

Nick raised a finger. ""One‚Ä¶""

""Two‚Ä¶""

Something in the air shifted.

""Three.""

A single knock echoed in the cellar.

Nick lifted both hands into the air, turned to the camera, and whispered, ""THAT WAS SO LOUD,"" and mouthed 'what the fuck‚Äô.

That hadn't been from any of my devices. I don't know if it was something one of them had done, but the look of surprise on their faces hinted otherwise.¬†

Ryan spoke, ""That's good. Thank you. Can you do it again?""

They waited in silence for a bit, so I played the sounds of a sobbing child for half a second, a notch louder than before.

And as expected, the whole group had brilliant o-faces on.

After a pause Nick said, ""I'm pretty sure we just heard somebody say something up there. Do you want to come in and show yourself to us? We don't mean any harm, we don't mean any disrespect, but we do want to experience all that you have to offer. We want to see you!""¬†

Justin shifted and said, ""Maybe we should start filming out there.""

They all stood up and headed out of the cellar, moving to set up the next phase of the investigation. I switched to the camera outside of the cellar. The scent dispensers worked their magic, and I could see it clearly on their faces that they were smelling it.

Ryan grimaced, pulling his hoodie up over his nose. ""Oh man, that is rank. Who died?""

Nick sniffed the air cautiously before recoiling. ""Yeah, that's got layers to it.""

Hunter pretended as he was about to violently throw up. ""I hate to break it to you all, but I'm pretty sure we just entered scratch-and-sniff hell.""

Isaiah spoke, ""Oh, okay, sure. That's totally normal. Nothing weird about that at all.""

That was my cue. I set off a distant speaker to start playing the sobbing child quietly, occasionally bumping up the volume, and nonstop.

Nik said, ""What the fuck is that?""

Isaiah brushed his hair back with his hand from his forehead. ""We're cooked. We're done. Pack it up."" He said with a nervous chuckle that turned into faux-sobbing.¬†

Jonno spoke up, ""That better be something you guys set up.""

Ryan turned around, ""Uh... No, we really don't do that.""

Justin said, ""I'm bugging so hard right now‚Ä¶""

I gave the buried motors a few spins nearby.

""Do you guys feel that?!"" Nick scream-whispered.¬†

Ryan turned around. ""I swear something was walking next to me.""

The music box that Ryan was holding started going off. I really don't know how theirs works, but they were all freaking out about it, and I could sense that woman churning. This cannot be good. I've not stopped sensing her presence since the day before, and I can still feel it, but, it's like I could feel it twitch in that moment. I took a very deep breath and continued watching the monitors. I was spinning the motors here and there, playing distant cries sporadically. They reacted intensely to everything.¬†

Jonno lifted and dropped his hands in desperation. ""You guys. This isn't really tickling me arse hole in a way I'm comfortable with. I'm out.""¬†

Nik responded, ""Are you good, man? If you need to leave, here are the keys. Just don't leave us stranded, alright?""¬†

He started heading back to the van, and the rest of the group made their way to the well. I flipped back and forth between the feeds. I have cameras leading all the way to the Dark Entry Forest sign, but I switched back to Jonno's feed, and he was gone. ""The fuck?"" I switched through each camera on the trail out, trying to find him, but he just vanished. My cameras must be malfunctioning. I decided the best I could do would be to look out the van and check if the Creepcast crew's van had moved or had any lights on. I switched back to the group approaching the well. The group moved cautiously toward the well, the crunch of gravel beneath their boots the only sound cutting through the otherwise still night. Justin had the camera trained ahead, his grip visibly tighter on the rig. Every few steps, one of them glanced over their shoulder.

Ryan took a deep breath, exhaling slowly. ""Alright, the well."" He turned to the camera, slipping back into the presenter mode. ""The stories say voices come from down there, people see things standing on the edge, looking in, and some say if you stare into the darkness long enough, you'll see something staring back.""¬†

Nick adjusted his beanie, rubbing his arms. ""Great. Love that. Amazing idea, really.""

Hunter clapped a hand on his shoulder. ""You say that like you're not about to be the one lowered in for the Estes Method.""

Nick pressed his lips together, eyes narrowing. ""And yet, somehow, that fact isn't making me feel any better.""

Isaiah folded his arms. ""I, for one, am very excited to learn what's at the bottom of the mysterious haunted well. I hope it has great vibes.""

Nik looked toward the darkness beneath them. ""Yeah, well, if I see anything move in there, I'm actually leaving. No camera drop, no warning. Just full sprint back to the van.""

Nick climbed onto the stone ledge surrounding the well, shifting his weight uneasily. ""Isaiah, think I can convince you to go in my stead? You have Jesus on your side, after all.""

Isaiah responded, ""Not a snowball's chance, my friend.""

¬†Justin turned the camera on him as Ryan spoke. ""Alright, you guys know the drill. Nick's going to be blindfolded, headphones in, completely isolated while we ask the questions.""

Hunter nodded. ""Worst-case scenario, he gets possessed and we make a killing on an exorcism live-stream.""

Nick sat on the ledge, exhaling through his nose as he slipped the blindfold over his face. ""Alright. Let's do this before I remember I have free will.""

I leaned forward in my seat. My heart pounded as Ryan, Hunter, and Isaiah lowered him slowly into the well. The rope creaked under his weight. The only light came from their flashlights, illuminating the damp stone as he descended. Then, for just a moment, I saw something shift behind them.

I flicked to another camera. Nothing.

I switched back. The shadows near the well had changed.

Nick cried out, ""Yo, guys, stop. Stop. STOP.""

Isaiah leaned his head over the well's opening, ""you alright down there, buddy?""

""There's something down here‚Ä¶ I need you guys to lift me back out.""

The guys all looked at each other a quick moment before they started lifting him out again. I don't know what he would've seen. I've been down there, and the only thing I've seen is stone and mud.

""Guys, something is crawling up, fucking hurry!""

They started pulling on the rope more furiously, but then they all fell back on the ground like the rope had been cut. A long, painful shriek came out of the well; it was terrible and kept going and going. He breathed in nearly just as loud as he screamed and kept screaming. Everyone above the well was panicking. His body was levitating, rising out of the well. Nick was clawing ferociously at his neck, each of his fingers a bloody mess. He was tearing out his own throat, screaming all the while. Until‚Ä¶ his head was twisted so that he was facing his back. The pop of dislocating bone, the ripping of flesh and arteries as his blood began gushing out his throat. The thud as his body dropped to the forest floor. The rope flew out around Justin's neck and began forcing him towards the well. He tried his best to resist, heels buried deep into the earth, but it was stronger. Once his head was over the opening, the rope stopped pulling him in and started pulling straight down. He screamed for only a moment, but without delay, the rope tore through his neck, his headless corpse lying at the base of the well. I vomited harder than I ever knew possible. The fear, the dread audible in his screaming‚Ä¶¬†

I forced my gaze back at the screen and found they had made a pretty good distance away from the well. As they ran past the cellar, they all slowed down and began staring into the trees. I switched to another camera. It was Jonno. He was crucified on a tree; he had no eyes. Ryan, Isaiah, and Nik rushed to try to get him down, but Hunter looked for a moment, muttering to himself, tears rolling down his face. He began to walk away, then back into a run‚Ä¶ he actually started singing.¬†

""Aruba, Jamaica, oh I wanna take ya,"" each word hitting the notes perfectly. Good gods, this man was sprinting at full speed, crying, and singing Kokomo by the Beach Boys. ""Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama"" I started sobbing, watching these men get picked off one after the other‚Ä¶ ""We'll get there fast, and then we'll take it slo‚Äî"" It looked like Hunter had been clotheslined. You could see him struggling to catch his wind on the ground.

And there she was. She manifested ten feet in front of Hunter, crawling, sobbing with that pout on her face, blood covered her hands and antlers. It was awful; her sobs grew more pitiful and obscene. Hunter noticed her and started backing up with his elbows, still trying to catch his breath from the fall.¬†

Ryan, Nick, and Isaiah caught on to what was happening, but they were still struggling to get Jonno off the tree.¬†

""What the heck is going on?"" Isaiah screamed, running toward his friend, but it was too late. The ghost was on top of him. She took his face into her hand and started bashing his head into a rock, Hunter screaming all the while. He pulled out his 45 and started shooting. When he emptied the magazine, Isaiah, bless him, tried to pull her off of him. But the second his hands touched her arm, his whole body caught flame. She continued bashing Hunter's head in long after the screaming stopped. I could hear the wet packing sounds of his broken skull being driven into the earth again and again‚Ä¶ Ryan and Nik both made it past her while she was busy.¬†

Nik was lagging behind; I could see his legs were starting to give out. Ryan was about halfway back to his van.¬†

""Fuck‚Äù I screamed, remembering I disabled his vehicle. I backed up next to his van, opened the back doors, turned the engine on, and prepared to get them into my van and drive away. I watched the monitors, anxiously tracking their progress. Nik's pace turned into a slow shuffle, stumbling, gasping, barely able to hold himself up. The ghost, apparently finished wrecking Hunter's now lifeless body, was charging up behind Nik, running unimaginably fast. She looked like a running back about to make a goal, with her antlers out in front of her. ""Come on, Nik, pick up the pace, dude; get out of there!"" I pleaded to my monitor. The ghost started screaming as she got nearer, and Nik, stumbling and panting, turned around. She jumped, her antlers gouging both his chest and his mouth. He never even got a chance to make a sound. Ryan was maybe 50 feet away from the van, so I stood up and screamed at him, ""Hurry, she's coming, get in the van now! Let's go, let's go!""¬†

He dove into the van; I shut the doors, ran to the driver's seat, and pounded on the gas pedal immediately.¬†

""Who the fuck are you? What the fuck is going on?!""¬†

""I don't know, man, I saw everything, but I don't‚Äî""

She was in the van with us.

""It's‚Ä¶ right behind me, isn't it?""

I peeked into the rearview just in time to see her pulling him out of the van.¬†

I couldn't help any of them.

I'm back at the motel now. She was already in the room when I arrived. She's been hovering behind my shoulder the entire time I've been writing this. She doesn't seem to want to hurt me, but I don't know what to do...",1,1757392135.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

My husband and I got married last year so this year was the first time we were filing our taxes together. My husband from the get go wanted his mom to do our taxes. I did not want her to for multiple reasons.

1) I know how to do my taxes. I've been doing them every year since I've (26F) been a legal adult. I'm not brilliant at it but turbo tax or h&r block online has gotten me through it. You would thing she wouldn't have wiped her son's ass all these years doing his taxes for him like he's a baby but whatever.

2) I don't need ‚Äúmiss thang‚Äù knowing any more of MY business than she already does. Which a reason I told my husband at the beginning of this year but I put it in a way like I'm embarrassed of my measly income. Which isn't untrue as she is always bragging about her job soooo.

3) She's an insufferable cunt and she pisses me off with her snobby ass always making me feel like I'm not good enough in EVERY. SINGLE. WAY.

Well there was some confusion as to whether or not a company I worked for last year had to give me a tax form so we put in an extension. This wasn't resolved till recently.

Well my husband took all of his stuff to his mommy on Saturday and they sat down to do it. I couldn't be there it was fine but I knew I needed to sign off on the taxes before they were submitted. Or so I thought.

They had enough of my tax information to authorize it for me without them letting me look first. I. Was. Livid.

I assumed when he said they were done that I'd be looking over them and then we would submit them. Nope!

He got home and I asked and then when I threw a shit fit I'm the bad guy.
I should trust him and his mom
It totally wasn't illegal what they did. (Ummm yes it is)
So the matter wasn't made into ‚ÄúOh hey maybe I should have some respect for my wife/ dil and let her see something she had a legal right to‚Äù my husband was bitching about me not trusting her. 

Her being grand old Mil the one he touts as a tax genius. You know? One time she single handedly wielded her tax genius and saved the day when a couple was hours maybe even minutes from getting arrested. 

Oh fucking please. Yep, he told me that story. He really has said she's a tax genius. Continually told me she's an actual professional that does this for a living and gets paid to do it and he truly believes that. 

So let's explore the facts. Shall we?

I searched to find her ptin. Nope none
Oh I thought she got paid to do some? Oh well I guess that's ok doing it illegally if you are such a smarty pants.

How did she actually do our taxes? 
She fucking used turbo tax like a monkey!
I thought they were getting done by In Law Genius extraordinaire McPro
My fucking Chimp ass could have put them into fucking turbo tax.

So no mother fucker she's about as much of a professional as my left nut if I had one.

Once I asked to see them today and I couldn't find the log in information that my husband said was in the folder he brought home. He messaged his mom to get the code.

I didn't see the texts but from what he told me she was being sad about the fact that I don't trust her something like ‚ÄúOh she doesn't trust me‚Äù or some shit

Waagh waagh

Bitch! If your dumb fucking ass was a professional you wouldn't be bitching and whining that I don't trust you. You would have showed me my mother fucking tax return BEFORE IT WAS SUBMITTED.

Oh and she did weasel her ass around stuff like a cunt. Yeah the government will never know probably that I got paid $750 by HER to babysit her grandchild. That I intentionally sent to him to put on there. Because that's the legal right thing to do. When I confronted my husband about it today. Oh it was under the threshold or Oh she said it was a favor. Bitch who pays for favors? I got paid to do a job.

I really dream of raising a big stink about all this legally but at the end of the day it probably wouldn't get anywhere and would just bite me in the ass.

But if she wants to bring up taxes when I'm around I am oh so game.

I'm so ready for her to say something shitty about anything in person so I can put her in her snobby ass place and if and when I do and my husband gets mad I'll remind him that he said he'd be fine with me telling her off in instances she crosses a line. 

I need to post on here some potential things I know she could say/bitch about so that I have comebacks ready and I don't think of shit 10 days later when I'm in the shower.

(Oh and update if anyone read my post where I bitched about them making a big stink out of getting me a birthday gift but didn't. They did. Some cheap pajamas and she also sent over an assload of random crap, mostly old used body washes and makeup.)

Another thing tonight
My husband and I were going through his clothes cause he has tons he doesn't wear. Well I could definitely use the money if I sold them but I'd rather give them to the tons of people I know that are in need. 
DH took a picture of the dog being goofy under the coffee table which is where I had a stack of clothes. After I packed all the ones he is getting rid of up he gets a text from his mom saying your dad probably will want some.
Really? You really had to send a picture with a pile of clothes that had to be in it to your mommy so she can be nosy and or bitch?
I fucking new he was probably texting mommy I should have said let me get these clothes out of the way first because that will embarrass me.

Do you really need these clothes? Seriously? Always ALWAYS BRAGGING ABOUT HOW WELL OFF YOU ARE AND HOW YOU'LL RETIRE SO WEALTHY 
My goodness can't some poor folks have some clothes please?!

So now I have to get the clothes out that are his size. I would love to sabotage them but I don't want to waste clothes so I need to find a way out of it. Or maybe there are some grandpa looking shirts that size that I can give him and say the rest are stained.

I was going to wait and post this tomorrow incase I forgot anything. I'm sure I did but I'll add it when it comes to me.

I remember this being an American/Canadian sitcom (am not striking out British, but unsure) from 2000s to maybe max 2015 about a group of friends where the season or series ending was a pan up from their usual meeting place (ex; coffee shop/apartment from Friends) into darkness that then tracks up through dirt and reveals a cemetery, implying that the characters might have been dead all along (?) \[am not ruling out it just being in the future, I specifically only remember it being their stones\]

Series I've crossed out but ALMOST has the ending (to give you an idea) are Blackadder and Dead Like Me.

Sorry to not have more info but it's all I can remember from it but I do distinctly remember having seen this.

Would also be open to web series and film endings, & also a moment in a show/film  only if they genuinely have a scene that could match.

1nc9gyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Background-Raise6389/comments/1nc9gyj/the_best_water_filter_pitchers_and_dispensers/,The Best Water Filter Pitchers and Dispensers,"Clean, good-tasting water feels like one of those little upgrades that ends up changing your whole daily routine. I didn‚Äôt realize how much difference it made until I started using filter pitchers and dispensers at home. They‚Äôre inexpensive, super low effort, and way easier than messing around with plumbing or under-sink systems. If you just want something simple on the counter or in the fridge, these are some of the ones I‚Äôve actually tried and liked.

I will say though, if you ever decide to go further, the under-sink or faucet filters definitely perform better in the long run. They‚Äôre faster, they handle more contaminants, and they don‚Äôt need to be swapped out as often. But for everyday use when you don‚Äôt want to break out tools or call a plumber, pitchers and dispensers have been more than enough for me.

## üèÜ Best Overall Pitcher: [Brita Standard Everyday Pitcher](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-filter-pitchers#brita-standard-everyday-pitcher)

This was the first pitcher I bought when I wanted to stop relying on bottled water, and it‚Äôs been surprisingly dependable. The thumb-flip lid makes it easy to refill with one hand, and the SmartLight is nice because I don‚Äôt have to guess when the filter‚Äôs shot. I also noticed the handle is actually comfortable to carry even when it‚Äôs full, which isn‚Äôt something I thought about until I had to lug it around all the time.

One thing I realized after comparing it to Brita‚Äôs Tahoe model at a friend‚Äôs place is how much easier this one is to hold. The D-shaped handle on the Tahoe feels clunky when the pitcher is heavy, but the Standard Everyday has a better grip. Mine holds a little more than the listed 10 cups, and I like that it‚Äôs compatible with the Elite filters, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about performance dropping off.

## üí∏ Best Budget Pitcher: [Waterdrop Water Filter Pitcher](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-filter-pitchers#waterdrop-water-filter-pitcher)

I picked this up as an inexpensive filter for my office mini-fridge, and it‚Äôs actually pretty great for the price. It has this neat lid that opens automatically when water hits it, which makes filling it way less of a hassle. The LED light that turns red when the filter‚Äôs done has saved me from drinking stale-tasting water more than once.

The filter life is what really impressed me here, it lasts way longer than most others I‚Äôve used. I drink a ton of water and usually burn through filters quickly, but this one keeps going for months. Coffee tastes better too, which I didn‚Äôt expect from a budget pitcher. If you‚Äôre trying to spend as little as possible without ending up with something flimsy, this one is worth checking out.

## üèÜ Best Overall Dispenser: [Brita Ultramax Dispenser](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-filter-pitchers#brita-ultramax-dispenser)

I switched to the Ultramax when my household‚Äôs water consumption started skyrocketing, and the extra capacity makes a huge difference. Having 18 cups ready plus the top reservoir filtering more water means there‚Äôs always enough for everyone without constant refills. It‚Äôs a long, narrow shape too, so it fits in the fridge better than I expected.

The spigot is the real winner here. Even my niece can pour herself a glass without spilling anything, and I like that it closes automatically when you let go. The only real downside is the weight, once it‚Äôs completely full, moving it around to clean is a workout. Still, it beats constantly refilling a pitcher when you‚Äôve got multiple people in the house drinking from it.

## üíé Best Upgrade Dispenser: [LifeStraw Home Dispenser](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-filter-pitchers#lifestraw-home-dispenser)

A friend of mine swears by the LifeStraw Home Dispenser, and it‚Äôs honestly a step above the typical options. It‚Äôs built like the Brita Ultramax with a spigot design that‚Äôs easy for kids to use, but the big difference is that it‚Äôs certified to remove bacteria and parasites on top of the usual chlorine and metals. That extra level of protection makes it stand out, especially if you‚Äôre in an area with questionable water quality.

He told me the two-stage filter setup has been really solid. The hollow fiber membrane blocks bacteria and sediment, and then the carbon filter takes care of taste and chemicals. He said the carbon one needs changing every couple months, but the hollow fiber lasts much longer, which keeps maintenance pretty easy. From what I‚Äôve seen at his place, if you want an upgrade from standard dispensers without adding complexity, this one‚Äôs hard to beat.",1,1757391823.0,u_Background-Raise6389,0,1.0,False
