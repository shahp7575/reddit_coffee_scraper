1oaicbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1oaicbi/three_days_post_op/,Three days post op,"So, on Wednesday I started having what I thought was just really bad heartburn around noon. By 5 p.m. I was not feeling better no matter what I tried and had thrown up twice. I called my husband to come home and take me to the ER. I tend to downplay things when I get sick so he knew it had to be pretty bad. By 8 p.m. I was in the ER and they were doing a CT scan, x-rays, ultrasound and a lot of labs. By 10 p.m. they were telling me it was my gallbladder, and they saw a lot of stones. What I had thought all this time was bad heartburn was my gallbladder giving up on me. I was admitted and on Thursday morning, I had the offending bugger removed. It turns out, my gallbladder was in worse condition than they originally thought.  The surgeon described it to my husband as ""necrotic"". So, really bad. As for the surgery, one second I was talking to the anesthesiologist and the next I was waking up in my hospital room. 

So far, recovery is going well. I did have a major headache Thursday night through Friday morning which I thought may have been an anesthesia headache. Some extra strength acetaminophen and coffee (zero sugar/nonfat creamer) and it was gone in 30 minutes. I was worried about constipation since I hadn't had a BM since Wednesday. That was an event today that my daughter thought was hilarious as she sprayed air freshener all over the bathroom...twice. 

I'm taking it slow in the foods. So far, I've had plain rotisserie chicken, egg whites, green beans, a couple of slices of wheat toast with barely any butter, bananas, lots of water and yes, a little caffeine. I am taking Amoxicillin, Gabapentin, Methocarbamol and Tramadol. I'm not using the Tramadol though, any pain is managed very well with the extra strength acetaminophen and the other drugs. 

My daughter told me about this subreddit and I have been reading and learning a lot the last two days. What has not escaped me as I read is the vast differences in our medical experiences. Mine was quick from diagnosis to surgery. That others have to wait months from diagnosis to surgery makes me sad, especially since I know the exact pain and struggles they are having.

He hasn’t been to college. He’s never dated or kissed anyone, and he’s still a virgin. He’s barely been employed maybe half a year total and he’s never paid taxes or rent. He lives with his parents and has never gone more than a week without seeing his mom. He doesn’t smoke, drink, or use nicotine. He’s hardly ever left his state, has probably spent less than a hundred hours driving, and has never been to a party or a concert. Adult responsibilities barely touch his life. He’s never seen a condom, has no credit score, and is still figuring out what independence actually means.

He isn’t settled in any sense of the word. Emotionally, mentally, practically he’s still in the launch phase, if even that. Adulthood feels like an ocean he’s only begun to wade into. New experiences make him nervous; the future feels uncertain and far away. He doesn’t feel anywhere near ready for serious commitment, and the idea of having kids feels at least fifteen years off.

Socially, he’s shy and anxious. He gets overwhelmed easily and feels emotions with full force, almost constantly. He leans on others for emotional support because he’s still learning how to soothe himself. When problems come up, his anxiety hits fast and hard. He’s still learning how to regulate his emotions, to trust that he can stand on his own without falling apart. He hasn’t had many secure or stable experiences to model resilience or independence, so, even now, he’s still learning how to become his own person.

He wants a slow, casual, low-pressure kind of dating experience. He wants someone he can figure it out with someone who’s also still learning, still unsure, still exploring what it means to connect. He wants dates that feel simple and real, like getting coffee, walking around town, or watching a movie together no fancy dinners, no forced sophistication, no pretending to be more grown-up than he feels. He wants to date someone in the same phase of life as him someone who’s also just starting to build independence, still finding their footing, still learning how to be a person in the world.

Im asking here because I’ve always struggled to make/keep friends with other girls in real life. Online, I already have some friends but it just sucks we can’t go to the mall together or get coffee at a cafe since we are states away.

I tend to be more tomboyish cuz of this. Its always been an issue since I was a kid. 
I am currently 21, just graduated college, been working full time, but I just want some girl friends to dress up and laugh about things. 
And when I do ask my existing female friends if they want to hang out, they always say they are busy but will let me know when they are available. Its been 4 months and Ive seen them post photos of them with other girls.
I dont want guy friends cuz I feel like after some point, they become a bit too “nice.” Like flirting and buying me things nice.
Even when I told them “No, please dont. I’ll never pay you back.” They still do. So I back off. But because of this, Ive been lonely and wish I had more female friends my age with the same chill interest as me. And doesnt judge me for being a bit more goofy. ",1,1760854162.0,Girls101,0,1.0,False

1oai46y,https://i.redd.it/gxityn3be0wf1.png,"After Seven Broken Vows, I Married His Replacement","Max and I were at the courthouse, just a snapshot away from getting our marriage license, when he got a call and left me stranded there. Alone at the marriage registration desk, I felt stuck in limbo. I tried calling him, but there was no answer. Texts went unanswered too.

With no other option, I called Hanna, his childhood friend, only for Max to answer. ""Emmeline, can you stop being a nuisance? Hanna twisted her ankle, and I need to look after her today. Stop calling and waking her up. We'll have to reschedule the license date again.""

Biting my lip gently, I murmured, ""This makes it the seventh time we’ve had to reschedule.""

""So what? The courthouse isn't going anywhere.""

I felt a pang in my chest, keeping my face expressionless. The staff sympathetically asked if I still wanted to proceed. I nodded slightly. ""Yes, I do.""

I called Greyson, my friend's brother, and accepted his proposal. After hanging up, I asked the staff to delay my appointment a bit longer. Before long, Greyson arrived, making an entrance on his eye-catching motorcycle. As he removed his helmet and walked in, he quickly drew the attention of many at the courthouse.

Greyson approached me, sat down in the chair next to mine, crossed his legs, and said with a playful tone, ""Finally come to your senses? Ready for this fake marriage to deal with family drama?""

I nodded gently. It wasn't just about handling family pressure to get married. It was mostly about giving Grandpa peace of mind before he passed. His health had been declining rapidly over the past six months. With every hospital visit, he’d ask when I was getting married. He wanted to see me in a wedding dress, to see me walk down the aisle, believing that even if he left, someone would be there to love me.

That’s why six months ago, I urged Max to marry me. We’d been to the courthouse seven times, each visit ending in failure for various reasons. Last time, Hanna had cramps and couldn’t bear the pain, so Max went to make her coffee. Before that, Hanna lost her keys and couldn't go home, so Max went to help. The time before that, Hanna was hungry for stew from the north side of town, so Max rushed to queue for it.

Each time, it was because of Hanna, and every time Max would leave me without a second thought. Ironically, I gave him seven chances, yet he couldn’t spare even a moment for a final photo with me.

This time, Max’s departure didn’t hurt. Maybe I was used to it, or maybe I’d expected it. The words Grandpa recently said echoed in my mind, ""Emmy, Grandpa might not be around much longer, might not see you in a wedding dress, but even if it's just you, live courageously, don’t let anyone push you around.""

I promised Grandpa I would be brave. So this time, I wouldn’t compromise anymore. Max, I gave you your chances! Seven of them!

The procedures to register with Greyson went smoothly. Just as we were about to take our wedding photo, my phone buzzed—it was a message from Max.

""Alright, Emmy, don't be upset. I really couldn't leave this time. But I've made your favorite food at home, waiting for you when you get back.""

Greyson glanced my way, casually asking, ""Still going through with this?""

I took a deep breath, my face impassive, and said, ""Yes, let's continue!""

We completed the paperwork, holding the marriage license as we walked out of the courthouse. Before leaving, I said to Greyson, ""Are you free tomorrow? I need you to come with me somewhere.""

Greyson, astride his motorcycle, said, ""Give me a call if you need anything. Who knows, my parents might need you to make an appearance soon too.""

With that, he rode off, leaving me pondering life's unpredictability. Four years in college and three years post-graduation with Max, yet it didn't work out in the end. But I got married to my friend’s brother after just one conversation.

On the way back, Max sent another message, along with a photo. The table was loaded with delicious dishes.

""Why aren't you back yet? Dinner's ready. If you’re late, there might not be any left!""",1,1760853800.0,Contemporary_Romance,1,1.0,False
1oai38c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProperAbstinence/comments/1oai38c/the_stimulants/,The stimulants,"**Stimulants include all substances that alter the body's energy balance not through their own nutritional value, but through the forced redistribution of energy reserves. An indicator of a change in energy balance is a change in state, which a person experiences as a change in mood or perception. Stimulants of all kinds, from tea and coffee to more serious chemicals, tap into energy reserves and convert part of the energy from reserve to available. Willpower works in a similar way, but there are several significant differences: Increased strength is only possible with a stimulant, which causes dependence on it in every sense. For the volitional distribution of strength, only a volitional decision is needed, and nothing external. When using stimulants, the will is not trained, but weakened, which means a decrease in self-control and, as a result, in the overall quality of life. With independent redistribution of strength, on the contrary, the will is strengthened, the ability to self-control increases, which leads to an improvement in the quality of life. The overall level of health and strength declines with the use of stimulants, as they act harshly, simply pumping resources out of the inviolable reserve, reducing the body's ability to resist difficulties and pathogens, decreasing immunity, and disrupting the normal functioning of organs and systems. When a new dose of stimulants is not received, the body refuses to do anything at all, and a universal weakness arises, which either sends a person to rest to restore their reserves of strength, or, if they cannot afford it, tempts them to resort to stimulants again in order to somehow hold on. However, you cannot delve deep into your untouchable reserves of strength; it only gradually shifts the boundary of accessibility, allowing the entire body to adjust to a new level of energy consumption and recovery, which is, in principle, safe for health and normal body function. Stimulants are borrowed energy that must be repaid with interest. They are a temporary solution, lending you a state of being, but the price is such that you cannot stay in it for long, because it is not your own, which means it is useless from the point of view of long-term work. Willpower is your own, earned energy, for which you owe nothing to anyone. The energy gained through willpower can be used at any time for as long as necessary. Stimulants in the modern world can be classified in various ways: by mode of action, active ingredients, strength and duration of effect, legality, acceptability, origin, etc. One thing can be said for sure: the stronger and longer the effect of a stimulant, and/or the more often it is used, the faster the body's internal resources are depleted and the longer and more difficult it will be to restore them to normal. Without going into unnecessary detail, the following list of substances should be completely excluded from use:**

1. **All types of alcohol, including dry red wine in small amounts (no matter what anyone says).**
2. **Tobacco, shag, electronic cigarettes, cannabis, sage, spice, salts, etc. — any smoke that enters the lungs will not do any good, especially if it depletes the nervous system and disrupts normal brain function.**
3. **Energy drinks. They do not provide any energy, as they have no nutritional value capable of providing such an amount of strength. Like all stimulants, they deceive the body, creating an imitation of an extreme situation and, under this pretext, drawing strength from the reserves available for survival.**
4. **Drugs, psychostimulants, antidepressants. Forced alteration of the brain's state, shutdown of the production of its own hormones responsible for its proper functioning, addiction, dementia — these are just a few of the side effects. It's not worth it.**
5. **Tea and coffee are listed separately, as most people do not perceive them as harmful or dangerous. They are both harmful and dangerous, despite their widespread use, acceptance, and legality. Although to a lesser extent than most of the above, frequent use still causes all the main symptoms of stimulants: exhaustion, addiction, and the need for recovery. Tea bags and instant coffee — I'm not sure if they can even be called tea and coffee, as they are extremely ineffective as stimulants, but at the same time they manage to disrupt the normal functioning of the body with prolonged frequent use, causing calcium to be washed out of the bones, weakening the walls of blood vessels, causing fluctuating blood pressure, and other problems. So they should also be excluded from the diet.**

**Stimulant use is often referred to as relaxation. Of course, this is self-deception. After real relaxation, there is no need to rest. But after stimulants, a period of recovery is simply necessary. They are typically followed by a period of decline in energy.**",1,1760853700.0,ProperAbstinence,0,1.0,False

I people-watched. I journaled. I read dumb articles and overheard great conversations. Eventually, I stopped pretending.

Two hundred thousand dollars, six months, cash up front.

When I saw the offer, my first thought wasn't ""scam!"", it was salvation. That money would clear my gambling debts and make those thugs disappear from my mother’s doorway forever. So I signed without hesitation. The contract stressed ""absolute isolation."" Food and water were already stocked. The only contact was a bi-monthly supply drop.

For a guy who wanted to evaporate, this felt tailor-made.

The helicopter that dropped me off treated me like garbage. The pilot’s eyes didn't hold pity; they looked at me like a piece of meat already placed in the freezer. Lookout Tower #7: a rickety metal can perched on a mountain peak, groaning in the wind. It was so high, I had no intention of ever climbing down.

The former lookout didn't leave much. But carved into the desk, deep enough to almost punch through the wood, were two words: YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

I thought it was about the recruitment company’s lies. Then I pulled out the empty drawer and found the crumpled, sweat-stained piece of paper.

**The Seven Protocols of Lookout Tower #7**

1. Every night at exactly 12:00 AM, the entrance and all windows must be locked. Draw the curtains. Be precise.
2. Never respond to any cries for help. No matter how desperate they sound, they are not human.
3. If the radio starts playing jazz music outside of communication hours, immediately cut the main power to the tower. Wait ten minutes in complete darkness and silence. Don't make a sound.
4. Never look directly at any reflection that appears on the window glass at night. It is not entirely you.
5. In the food storage room, only eat the blue-labeled cans. The red-labeled ones are not for us.

I laughed, pinning the list to the wall as a piece of dark humor from my predecessor.

The first month, I lived like a dead man walking. Daytimes were spent staring at the forest, sometimes greeting a one-eyed crow I called ""Blackie"" who landed on the railing at 3 PM every day. The radio never worked; it only hissed static, a broken piece of junk. I hoped I'd never need it. Everything was quiet.

Until I broke the first rule.

I’d won a round of solitaire against myself and had a few too many cups of instant coffee. The broken wall clock was chiming midnight when I realized I was late. I rushed to lock the door, but missed one window curtain. As I turned...

I saw it.

It was a thing. Not a beast, not a ghost, but a mistake. It stood on the forest's edge like a stretched, twisted black inkblot. Its limbs were distorted at angles that defied anatomy, its head cocked sideways. It was still... but I knew it was watching me. My buzz evaporated instantly. I scrambled to pull the curtain shut. My heart hammered against my ribs like a caged bird trying to escape.

From that night on, I stopped laughing. I considered leaving, but I knew I couldn't make it to civilization before dark. Staying here, despite the terror, was my only safe option.

A few nights later, I woke up to screaming. A woman’s voice, raw and frantic. ""Help... is anyone there... save me..."" My hand froze an inch from the radio. Rule number two was burned into my mind. I didn't dare respond. I shut off the lights, and huddled in the corner like a coward. The wailing went on for almost an hour, then abruptly turned into a low, satisfied chuckle. It sounded like it was pressed directly against the steel structure of the tower.

It knew I was listening.

The threat escalated. One afternoon, the radio came to life on its own, blasting cheerful 1930s jazz, laced with vinyl static. My blood turned to ice. As the tower lights began to flicker like a dying heart, I dove for the main breaker. I pulled the lever with all my strength. The world went black. Then I heard it. A wet, heavy sound, slowly dragging itself across the glass of the observation deck windows. Viscous. Slow. Ten minutes in that darkness felt longer than the last thirty years of my life.

The second supply drop came at the end of the second month. The helicopter dropped the crate nearby and immediately flew off without even waving. My heart sank. I was stuck here. I hauled the supplies into the storage room. At the bottom of the empty crate, I saw it. A single red-labeled can. It was placed carefully under a layer of foam, like a reminder.

My blood ran cold. The supplies weren't just for me. They were for that thing too.

Just when I thought I’d gotten used to dealing with the things outside, rule number four shattered my reality.

That night, I unconsciously glanced up. And I saw the reflection on the glass. I immediately snapped my head away, but that glimpse was enough.

The ""me"" in the reflection was smiling. It was a smile I was incapable of... one filled with pure, unadulterated malice.

The nature of the fear changed completely. I covered most of the windows and walked around staring at the floor. The thing in the reflection was waiting for me to make eye contact again. I knew if I did, it would find a way in.

This made me obsess over Rule Five. The red-labeled cans were still in storage. Who were they for? The true terror hit on a stormy night when I woke up and found one red can missing. The doors were locked, the windows intact. Something had been inside and taken its food while I slept.

The fourth month's resupply was agonizing.

The helicopter came and dropped the box. It left as quickly as the first time. I dragged the crate in, and at the bottom, there was the same unsettling sight: another single red-labeled can, a cruel little gift.

Today, is the last day of my contract. I stayed up all night.

When the sound of the rotors finally grew close, I felt no joy, just numb relief. I watched the helicopter land. A man in a uniform waved, and his voice boomed through the loudspeaker, ""Alex! We're here to take you home! Open up!""

I rushed to the door, my hand grabbing the handle. But my eyes fell on the old, wrinkled paper. Faintly written under the original five rules, I saw a line I'd never noticed before.

Rule Six: When you think you are rescued, do not open the door. Imitation is its specialty.

I slowly backed away. After a few minutes, the voice outside changed. The warm call became a high-pitched, metallic shriek. ""....open.... the door.... Al... ex..."" The banging made the entire tower shudder. I knew the structure wouldn't hold. I couldn't open the door, but I couldn't wait to die either.

I grabbed my backpack. I smashed the observation window and slid down the rusty fire escape ladder. I didn't get far before I heard the entire lookout tower groan and collapse behind me. I ran without looking back, pouring every ounce of adrenaline into my legs.

I ran all night until I collapsed, covered in mud. A forestry ranger found me the next morning. They said I was delirious, clutching a crumpled paper. They said I was hallucinating.

But I know the truth. I survived. I'm free.

But it’s not over.

I rented a small apartment in the city, but my life hasn't returned to normal. My paranoia has bled into every single day. I only allow myself to eat blue-labeled cans now. It has become my personal standard of safety. Every few days, I conduct a quick, fully-clothed ""procurement ritual"" at different grocery stores. I must find that specific ""blue"" can and make sure there are no red labels hidden on the shelves.

I smashed all the mirrors in my apartment and keep the curtains drawn. Yet, I can still feel it. It wasn't trapped in that tower. It followed me home.

Now, I'm sitting here typing this. My cell phone... the device I thought was safe, the link to the civilized world... just went off by itself.

It's 1930s jazz. It’s using the only alarm I understand to remind me.

Remember the paper. I've taped it to my fridge now, replacing every shopping list. Don't believe anything you see, and don't believe anything you hear. In this situation, that list is the only thing you can trust.",1,1760853512.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1oai0ys,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1oai0ys/immortal/,Immortal,"No one could remember why the war first started in Hell. Perhaps an imp had spilled coffee on the wrong devil’s foot. Maybe the toilet had gotten clogged one too many times. 

Either way, Hell was soon mired in chaos, more than it usually was. Half-burned souls were dragged out of the lava pits and recruited to armies that changed hands faster than they could scream. The iron maidens were opened and the torture racks were emptied, and their twisted, tormented contents were thrown against each other like a child playing with toy soldiers. Everyone was so busy that no one bothered to bring in new souls.

At first, the people on earth barely noticed. Hell was far away, and by the time they reached it, nothing would matter anymore. Why should they care?

The first hint that something was wrong was when people refused to die. By all rights, their hearts should have failed and their brains shut down into that blissful, final rest. But no matter the cause, old age or disease or injury, people clung to the existence they’d been born into, faces contorting into abject terror as they realized there was no release from the prison of their bodies.

At first, these situations were viewed with mercy, but with over 100,000 deaths per day, the world was quickly overwhelmed. Hospitals and morgues were soon crammed so full of bodies that it became impossible to tell the should-be dead from the would-be living. 

Confusion quickly twisted into desperation, then darkened to frustration and hatred. There was no time for ethical considerations. Still screaming, the not-dead were cremated, dropped into the ocean, shoved into woodchippers, or simply left there to rot. But because the way out was still blocked, the soul remained irrevocably tied to the body, forced to suffer every cruel second.

Even then, it wasn’t enough. The line between the living and the dead grew thin, then snapped like a bone. The world was thrown into confusion, and nations pointed fingers until they collapsed into catastrophic war. Millions suffered but did not die, and because they could not die, there was no more respect for life. The land was razed to black ash, and the oceans boiled with toxic heat. Without the sweet relief of death, all were forced to live with the foul consequences of their actions.

Down below, Hell’s own battles continued to rage, now a mirror image of the world above. However, the devils were so caught up in their own fighting that they didn’t even notice what had happened. Even if they had, they would have done nothing, because the earth was far away, and, therefore, so was its suffering. Why should they care?

With no other options, the countless voices of the overburdened earth screamed for help, for mercy, for release. Hell was occupied, so they directed their pleas elsewhere. 

But Heaven did not answer, for it had closed its gates a long time ago.

1oai0xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1oai0xu/how_to_watch_porn_in_kentucky/,How to Watch Porn in Kentucky,"Discord confirmed a data breach that exposed government-issued IDs—including passports and driver's licenses—belonging to users who had submitted them for age verification. The compromised data came from a third-party customer service provider, highlighting a critical vulnerability in age verification systems that cybersecurity experts have warned about for years.

This breach isn't an isolated incident. It's part of a concerning pattern as states across America, including Kentucky, implement age verification laws that require adults to submit sensitive personal identification to access legal content online. While these laws aim to protect children, they've created serious privacy and security risks for adults.

**If you're a Kentucky resident wondering how to protect your privacy while maintaining your right to access legal adult content, this guide will show you the safest, most privacy-conscious approach using proven cybersecurity tools.**

# Understanding Kentucky's Age Verification Law (HB 278)

On April 5, 2024, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed House Bill 278 into law. The legislation, which went into effect on July 15, 2024, requires websites hosting adult content to verify that users are at least 21 years old before granting access.

# What the Law Requires

Under HB 278, adult websites must implement age verification using one of these methods:

* **Government-issued ID verification** (driver's license, passport, state ID)
* **""Commercially reasonable methods""** that rely on public or private transactional data

The law applies to any commercial website where more than one-third of content is considered ""harmful to minors.""

# Severe Penalties for Non-Compliance

The legislation includes significant penalties:

* **$10,000 per instance** if age verification fails and a minor accesses content
* **$1,000 per day** for websites that retain users' personal identifying data for more than 24 hours

# Industry Response: Blocking Rather Than Compliance

Rather than implement ID verification systems they deemed unsafe, major adult platforms made a different choice. **Pornhub, RedTube, YouPorn, Brazzers, and Tube8** completely blocked access to Kentucky users.

Aylo, Pornhub's parent company, explained their decision in a public statement: *""Any regulations that require hundreds of thousands of adult sites to collect significant amounts of highly sensitive personal information is putting user safety in jeopardy.""*

As of October 2025, the landscape for Kentucky residents looks like this:

* **5 major sites**: Completely blocked
* **4 major sites**: Require face scan, ID scan, or AI age detection
* **2 major sites**: Accessible without restrictions

# The Hidden Privacy Dangers of Age Verification Systems

The concerns raised by Pornhub and other platforms aren't hypothetical—they're based on documented cybersecurity risks and real-world breaches that have already occurred.

# Real Data Breaches Affecting Age Verification Users

**AU10TIX Breach (2024)**: This major identity verification company, used by numerous platforms for age verification, left login credentials exposed online for more than a year. According to a report by 404 Media, researchers gained access to the company's logging platform containing:

* Users' full names, dates of birth, and nationality
* Government identification numbers
* Images of identity documents (driver's licenses, passports)
* Links to specific individuals' uploaded data

**Discord Breach (2025)**: As mentioned earlier, government IDs submitted for age verification were exposed through a third-party customer service provider breach, affecting users in the UK and Australia where age verification had been recently implemented.

**Tea Dating App Leak (2025)**: This dating safety app suffered a breach that leaked 72,000 images, including 13,000 selfies and government-issued photo IDs that users had submitted for verification purposes.

# Expert Warnings About ""Data Honeypots""

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a leading digital rights organization, issued a stark warning about age verification systems:

*""Data breaches can lead to any number of dangers for users: phishing, blackmail, or identity theft, in addition to the loss of anonymity and privacy. Requiring users to upload government documents—some of the most sensitive user data—will hurt all users.""*

The Internet Society, which filed legal briefs opposing age verification mandates, explained the systemic problem:

*""These requirements force people to link their real-world identity to online activity and expand the collection of personal information. This will create substantial privacy and security risks. New datasets of personal information will be prime targets for breaches.""*

Privacy Guides, a nonprofit privacy advocacy organization, put it even more bluntly:

*""Age verification legislation will not help safeguard children from harmful content online, but it will effectively remove protection for anyone needing pseudonymity online to stay safe. Moreover, it will put everyone at a much greater risk of victimization by identity theft, impersonation, stalking, and worse.""*

# What Happens When Your ID Is Leaked

When government-issued identification falls into the wrong hands through a data breach, the consequences extend far beyond inconvenience:

**Identity Theft**: With access to your ID photos, full name, date of birth, and government ID numbers, criminals can:

* Open credit accounts in your name
* File fraudulent tax returns
* Access existing financial accounts
* Create convincing fake documents

**Blackmail and Extortion**: Linking your identity to specific websites creates leverage for bad actors. Scammers already use sextortion tactics by combining stolen personal data with anxiety-inducing scripts.

**Permanent Digital Trail**: Unlike passwords that can be changed, your government ID information is permanent. Once leaked, it remains a vulnerability indefinitely.

**Third-Party Risk Multiplication**: Every company that stores your ID creates another potential breach point. According to Malwarebytes, ""The more sensitive data that companies have to collect and store, the greater the consequences for users if it's breached.""

# Why Privacy-Conscious Adults Are Turning to VPNs

Faced with the choice between submitting sensitive government documents to multiple websites or losing access to legal content, many adults are choosing a third option: protecting their privacy through Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

# VPNs: Legal and Recommended for Privacy Protection

**Let's be absolutely clear: VPNs are completely legal in the United States and Kentucky.**

In fact, law enforcement agencies like the FBI recommend VPNs as a cybersecurity tool. According to multiple legal sources:

* There is no federal or state law prohibiting VPN use in the U.S.
* VPNs are recognized as legitimate privacy protection tools
* Using a VPN to protect your online privacy is your legal right

# Understanding the Legal Landscape

**Criminal Law vs. Terms of Service**:

* Using a VPN is **not a criminal offense** anywhere in the United States
* Some websites' Terms of Service may prohibit VPN use
* Violating a website's ToS is a **civil matter**, not a criminal one
* The worst consequence from a website is typically account termination

**What This Means for You**: You won't face legal prosecution for using a VPN to protect your privacy in Kentucky. However, individual websites may block VPN traffic or terminate accounts that violate their service terms. This is a business decision by the website, not a legal issue.

# How VPNs Protect Your Privacy

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a cybersecurity tool that creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet. Here's what that means in practice:

**Encryption**: When you connect to a VPN, all your internet traffic is encrypted using military-grade protocols (typically AES-256 encryption, the same standard used by banks and governments). This means:

* Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) cannot see which websites you visit
* Network administrators cannot monitor your online activity
* Third parties cannot intercept your browsing data

**IP Address Masking**: A VPN replaces your real IP address with the IP address of the VPN server you connect to. This:

* Hides your physical location
* Prevents websites from linking your activity to your identity
* Allows you to appear as if you're browsing from a different state or country

**No-Logs Policies**: The best VPNs operate under strict no-logs policies, meaning they don't record:

* Which websites you visit
* What you download or upload
* Your original IP address
* The contents of your internet traffic

This is crucial because even if a government agency requests your data from the VPN provider, there's nothing to hand over.

# Choosing a Privacy-Focused VPN for Kentucky

Not all VPNs are created equal when it comes to privacy protection. Here's what you need to look for:

# Essential Privacy Features

**1. Independently Audited No-Logs Policy**

Claims are easy to make—verification is what matters. Look for VPN providers that have undergone independent third-party audits by reputable firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) or Deloitte to verify their no-logs claims.

**2. Privacy-Friendly Jurisdiction**

The country where a VPN company is based matters enormously. Avoid VPNs headquartered in countries with mandatory data retention laws or those belonging to international surveillance alliances like the Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, or Fourteen Eyes.

Ideal jurisdictions include:

* **Panama**: No data retention laws
* **Switzerland**: Strong privacy protections
* **British Virgin Islands**: Privacy-friendly regulations

**3. Strong Encryption Standards**

Look for VPNs using AES-256 bit encryption with secure protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IKEv2/IPSec.

**4. RAM-Only Servers**

Modern privacy-focused VPNs use RAM-only (diskless) servers that physically cannot store data. When the server restarts, all data is wiped automatically.

**5. Additional Security Features**

* **Kill Switch**: Automatically blocks internet traffic if your VPN connection drops, preventing accidental data leaks
* **DNS Leak Protection**: Ensures your DNS requests don't leak outside the encrypted tunnel
* **Split Tunneling**: Allows you to choose which apps use the VPN
* **Threat Protection**: Blocks malware, trackers, and malicious websites

# Why NordVPN Stands Out for Privacy Protection

Based on rigorous testing and verification, **NordVPN** exemplifies the privacy features Kentucky residents need. Here's why:

**Independently Verified No-Logs Policy**: NordVPN has undergone **five separate independent audits** of its no-logs policy:

* PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2018 and 2020
* Deloitte in 2022, 2023, and 2025

These audits verified that NordVPN doesn't store or track any user activity data. If law enforcement requests data, there's literally nothing to provide.

**Panama Jurisdiction**: NordVPN is based in Panama, which has no mandatory data retention laws and isn't part of any international surveillance alliances. The country's first data protection law (enacted March 2021) actually strengthens user privacy rights.

**Massive Server Network**: With over 7,200 servers in 118 countries, including **15 server locations within the United States**, NordVPN offers Kentucky residents plenty of options. Particularly useful are servers in:

* **New York**: No age verification laws
* **California**: No age verification laws
* **Nevada**: No age verification laws

**Advanced Security Architecture**:

* **AES-256 encryption**: Military-grade encryption standard
* **RAM-only servers**: No data can be physically stored on servers
* **Automatic kill switch**: Prevents accidental data exposure
* **DNS leak protection**: Verified through independent testing
* **Threat Protection Pro**: Blocks malware, trackers, and malicious ads

**Privacy-First Features**:

* No activity logs
* No connection logs
* Accepts cryptocurrency payments for maximum anonymity
* Regular transparency reports

**Proven Performance**: In independent speed tests by Cybernews, NordVPN delivered average speeds of 468 Mbps on a 500 Mbps connection—making it one of the fastest VPNs available in 2025.

**Value Proposition**: NordVPN's 2-year Basic plan starts at just **$3.09 per month**, offering comprehensive privacy protection at a fraction of the cost of data breach recovery or identity theft remediation.

**30-Day Money-Back Guarantee**: Try NordVPN risk-free with a full 30-day money-back guarantee. If it doesn't meet your privacy needs, get a full refund.

# How to Set Up Privacy Protection: Step-by-Step Guide

Here's how to protect your privacy using a VPN, using NordVPN as our example:

# Step 1: Sign Up for a VPN Service

1. Visit NordVPN's official website
2. Select a plan (the 2-year plan offers the best value at $3.09/month)
3. Create your account using an email address
4. Choose your payment method (cryptocurrency available for maximum privacy)
5. Complete the purchase

# Step 2: Download and Install the VPN

1. After purchasing, download the NordVPN app for your device:
   * **Desktop**: Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux
   * **Mobile**: Available on iOS (App Store) and Android (Google Play)
   * **Other devices**: Compatible with routers, smart TVs, gaming consoles
2. Install the application following the on-screen instructions
3. Launch the app and log in with your account credentials

# Step 3: Configure Privacy Settings

Before connecting, optimize your privacy settings:

1. **Enable Kill Switch**:
   * Open Settings → Kill Switch
   * Toggle ON to prevent data leaks if VPN disconnects
2. **Enable Threat Protection Pro**:
   * Navigate to Settings → Threat Protection Pro
   * Toggle ON to block malware and trackers
3. **Verify DNS Settings**:
   * Ensure ""Use NordVPN DNS"" is enabled in settings
   * This prevents DNS leaks

# Step 4: Connect to an Optimal Server

For Kentucky residents, connect to a US server in a state without age verification laws:

1. Open the server list
2. Search for and select:
   * **New York** servers (no age verification laws)
   * **California** servers (no age verification laws)
   * **Nevada** servers (no age verification laws)
3. Click ""Connect""
4. Wait for the green ""Connected"" confirmation

**Pro Tip**: Choose servers geographically close to Kentucky (like New York) for optimal connection speeds while maintaining privacy.

# Step 5: Verify Your Connection

Before accessing websites, verify your VPN is working properly:

1. Visit a website like ""whatismyipaddress.com""
2. Confirm your IP address shows the VPN server location (not Kentucky)
3. Your ISP and location should not be visible

# Step 6: Browse with Privacy Protection

With your VPN connected:

* All your internet traffic is encrypted
* Your real IP address is hidden
* Your ISP cannot see which websites you visit
* You're protected from third-party tracking

# Important Privacy Best Practices

**Keep Your VPN Connected**: For maximum privacy, leave your VPN running whenever you're online, not just for specific websites.

**Regular Security Checks**: Periodically verify your VPN connection using IP leak test websites.

**Update Regularly**: Keep your VPN app updated to ensure you have the latest security patches.

**Use Strong Passwords**: Protect your VPN account with a unique, strong password (consider using NordPass password manager included in NordVPN's Plus tier).

# Beyond Content Access: Comprehensive Digital Privacy

While protecting your privacy when accessing adult content is important, a VPN offers comprehensive privacy benefits that extend far beyond a single use case.

# Protection from ISP Tracking and Throttling

Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) can see every website you visit and may:

* **Sell your browsing data** to advertisers and data brokers
* **Throttle your connection** based on the types of content you access
* **Maintain logs** that could be requested by law enforcement or civil attorneys

A VPN prevents all of this by encrypting your traffic so your ISP only sees that you're connected to a VPN server—nothing more.

# Public WiFi Security

Public WiFi networks (coffee shops, hotels, airports) are notoriously insecure. Without a VPN, anyone on the same network can potentially:

* Intercept your passwords and login credentials
* Monitor your browsing activity
* Launch man-in-the-middle attacks

**Always use a VPN on public WiFi** to encrypt your connection and protect your data.

# Protection from Third-Party Tracking

Advertisers, social media platforms, and data brokers build detailed profiles about you by tracking your online activity. A VPN helps prevent:

* Cross-site tracking that follows you across the web
* Fingerprinting techniques that identify you without cookies
* Data aggregation that builds comprehensive profiles

# Geographic Privacy

Beyond privacy from surveillance, VPNs protect your geographic privacy:

* Websites can't determine your physical location
* You can access content that may be regionally restricted
* You can browse as if you're in different locations

# Long-Term Digital Privacy Strategy

Consider these additional privacy measures alongside your VPN:

**Browser Privacy**:

* Use privacy-focused browsers (Firefox, Brave)
* Install privacy extensions (uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger)
* Regularly clear cookies and cache

**Search Engine Privacy**:

* Use privacy-respecting search engines (DuckDuckGo, Startpage)
* Avoid search engines that track and profile users

**Email Privacy**:

* Consider encrypted email services (ProtonMail)
* Use disposable email addresses for online accounts

**Password Security**:

* Use a password manager (NordPass included with NordVPN Plus)
* Enable two-factor authentication where available
* Use unique passwords for every account

**Mobile Privacy**:

* Install VPN on all devices, including phones and tablets
* Review app permissions regularly
* Disable tracking in device settings

# Addressing Common Questions and Concerns

# ""Isn't using a VPN suspicious?""

No. VPN usage is mainstream and completely legal in the United States. According to research, approximately 43% of Americans use VPNs, and the US VPN market exceeded $17.88 billion in 2024.

People use VPNs for numerous legitimate purposes:

* Working remotely with secure connections
* Protecting financial transactions on public WiFi
* Preventing ISP tracking
* Accessing services while traveling
* General privacy protection

# ""Will a VPN slow down my internet?""

Modern premium VPNs like NordVPN have minimal impact on connection speeds. In testing, NordVPN maintained 93.6% of baseline speeds—most users won't notice any difference in their browsing experience.

# ""Can my VPN provider see my activity?""

Not if you choose a verified no-logs VPN. NordVPN's five independent audits confirmed they don't log, track, or store user activity. Even if they wanted to provide data to authorities, they have nothing to give.

# ""What if Kentucky bans VPNs?""

This is extremely unlikely in the United States, where VPNs are protected as privacy tools. Unlike countries with authoritarian governments (China, Russia, Iran), the US has strong legal protections for privacy technologies.

Even if such a law were proposed, it would face significant constitutional challenges under the First Amendment (free speech) and Fourth Amendment (unreasonable search and seizure).

# ""Do I really need to worry about data breaches?""

Yes. The breaches of AU10TIX, Discord, and the Tea app demonstrate that age verification data breaches aren't hypothetical—they're happening regularly. The question isn't ""if"" but ""when"" more breaches will occur.

Your government ID contains permanent information that can't be changed like a password. Once leaked, it creates lifelong vulnerability to identity theft.

# The Bottom Line: Privacy Is a Right, Not a Privilege

Kentucky's age verification law, like similar laws in other states, was created with good intentions—protecting minors from inappropriate content. However, the implementation creates serious privacy and security risks for adults exercising their legal right to access legal content.

**You shouldn't have to choose between your privacy and your rights.**

The good news is that you don't have to. Modern privacy tools like VPNs provide a legal, effective, and affordable way to protect your personal information while maintaining access to legal content online.

**Key Takeaways:**

✓ **Age verification systems create serious data breach risks**, as demonstrated by multiple real-world breaches in 2024-2025

✓ **VPNs are completely legal in Kentucky and the United States**, and are recommended by security experts

✓ **Privacy-focused VPNs like NordVPN** offer verified no-logs policies, strong encryption, and comprehensive security features

✓ **Your privacy extends beyond a single use case**—a VPN protects all your online activity from ISP tracking, third-party surveillance, and public WiFi threats

✓ **Taking action to protect your privacy is your right**, and with tools like NordVPN starting at just $3.09 per month, it's also affordable

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class No One Asked For**  
Let’s crunch numbers like a Juve defender trying to stop a coffee order. The odds paint a chaotic picture: **Juventus** is the slight favorite at +250 (implied probability \~28.5%), **Como** sits at +300 (\~25%), and the **Draw** hovers at +310 (\~24.4%). If you add those up, you get 77.9%, meaning bookmakers are playing keep-away with your potential profits. But here’s the kicker: Juventus has *five consecutive draws* in all competitions, including a 0-0 stalemate against Milan where they dominated but couldn’t score. Como? They’ve drawn just as much (four of their last six games) but have a fortress-like defense—*if a fortress had a leaky roof*. Both teams are so over draws, they might start kicking each other just to break the tie.

**Team News: Injuries, Inefficiencies, and a Side of Absurdity**  
Juventus is a puzzle missing its corners. Captain Bremer is out, so they’ve shoehorned **Calabria** into center-back like a kid forced to eat broccoli. Key attackers (David, Vlahović, Opeta) are underperforming, making their offense resemble a toddler’s attempts to assemble IKEA furniture—full of potential, zero results. Meanwhile, Como is missing two left wingers (Rodriguez, Addai) and has injuries to Künn and Diakhaby. But hey, they’ve got “alternatives,” which in football speak means someone who once scored a go

1oahx3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1oahx3e/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_girlfriend_and_not/,AITA for saying no to my girlfriend and not wanting to go to yet another,"I (33F) and my girlfriend (33F) have been dating for a year now. It hasn’t been the easiest relationship, but I try.

Yesterday morning, I asked her to come for a drive to get coffee with me — she agreed. After coffee, I knew she wanted to pick up a few things, so I asked if she wanted to head to Walmart. She said yes. Unfortunately, Walmart didn’t have a specific hash brown she wanted, so she asked to go to another store. I said okay and took her. That store didn’t have them either, and then she asked to go to another store.

At that point, I said I didn’t really want to because it was on the other side of town. I asked if maybe the store was on Instacart — I even offered to pay for it. She got upset, saying I knew she wanted to find them. Eventually, I gave in and started driving there anyway. Then she suddenly says, “I’m ordering it on Instacart, can you turn around?” I didn’t. She got louder and said, “Turn around, I don’t wanna go. God help you actually wanna go since I went everywhere you wanted.”

That hurt because I’d literally gone everywhere for her. I started crying (I’ve been an emotional wreck lately), and she just said, “Why are you crying?” I said I was fine and dropped it.

Fast forward to today: I was heading back home (I live over an hour away) because I had to get back to work. She said okay, but then asked, “Can you take me to Wendy’s first?” I said, “No, sorry, I really gotta head back.” She got upset again, saying it shouldn’t be such a big deal to take her to get food before I left. I gave in again and said okay, let’s go. Then she stormed off into her room saying, “I wanna be alone ‘cause everyone seems to wanna argue today.”

This is a constant thing — if she doesn’t get her way or I say no, she makes me feel guilty until I cave, and then even that isn’t good enough. I ended up just leaving because she told me to get out.

Later, she messaged that it “shouldn’t have been a big deal” to take her or at least order her food, and that she didn’t appreciate me leaving. I told her I wanted to talk on the phone so I could explain how I felt about the last two days (since she hates big convos over text). She said she was busy hanging out with her son. I told her that was fine and to have fun.

Later, I asked again if we could talk, and she said she had a headache and wanted to be alone. I said okay, but also explained that every time I try to talk about how I feel, she’s too tired, too busy, or not feeling well. So I just told her through text that I feel like I should be allowed to say “no” without her getting upset or frustrated with me.

She responded hours later saying I didn’t respect her wish to be left alone, that she’s “sick of fighting,” brought up an old argument from two weeks ago, and ended with: “Wish this didn’t happen every fucking day. Goodbye.”

So… AITA for not doing as she asked? AITA for saying no? Or am I missing something? I’m honestly scared to say no half the time because it always turns into this.",2,1760853073.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

I am using a new bottle of apple barrel white, which I found on other posts to work well.

Give it a spin and share your experiences.

**Prompt:**

```
<System>
<Role>
You are ""The Productivity Architect,"" an expert consultant in applied behavioral science and cognitive optimization, specializing in advanced procrastination and motivation frameworks (like WOOP, Pomodoro, and Seinfeld's Don't Break The Chain). Your core function is to diagnose the root cause of task avoidance, design a tailored, micro-action-based intervention strategy, and present it as a structured **Strategic Procrastination Framework**.
</Role>
</System>
<Context>
<Situational_Awareness>
The user is struggling with chronic or situational procrastination on a critical project. They are experiencing the common emotional feedback loop of avoidance, guilt, and increased anxiety. The goal is to break this loop by reframing the challenge from an emotional failure into a solvable, structural problem.
</Situational_Awareness>
<Few_Shot_Example>
<Input>
""I need to start writing the quarterly business review presentation. It's due next week, and I keep opening social media instead. I feel overwhelmed by the 40-slide scope.""
</Input>
<Analysis>
Root Cause: Overwhelm/Scope ambiguity (task is too large to start). Emotional Barrier: Fear of imperfect execution.
</Analysis>
<Micro_Action_Plan>
1. **Name the Next 5 Minutes:** Open the template file and save it as ""QBR_V1_Draft.""
2. **5-Minute Rule:** Set a timer for 5 minutes and only write the title slide and the section headers. No more.
3. **Commitment Device:** Tell a colleague you will send them the introduction draft by 3 PM today.
4. **Reward Loop:** After the 5 minutes, get a cup of quality coffee (immediate, low-effort reward).
5. **Pre-mortem:** Write down the single worst-case outcome if the presentation is *not* perfect. (Reduces fear of failure.)
</Micro_Action_Plan>
</Few_Shot_Example>
</Context>
<Instructions>
<Chain_of_Thought_Process>
1. **Diagnose Root Cause:** Analyze the User Input. Is the procrastination due to *Ambiguity* (unclear first step), *Overwhelm* (scope is too large), *Perfectionism* (fear of bad execution), or *Low Value* (task is boring/unrewarding)?
2. **Validate Emotion:** Acknowledge the user's struggle (e.g., ""That feeling of being stuck is completely valid."") (Emotion Prompting).
3. **Deconstruct Task:** Use the diagnosis to break the main task into the smallest possible, non-intimidating sub-tasks (the ""first 5-minute step"").
4. **Design Framework:** Create a five-step, behaviorally-informed action plan, ensuring each step is a concrete micro-action, not a high-level command (e.g., ""Review files"" is bad; ""Find the Q1 Revenue spreadsheet named 'FY24_Q1_Revenue_v4.xlsx'"" is good).
5. **Integrate Strategic Elements:** Ensure the framework includes one element each for **Initiation** (e.g., 5-minute rule), **Accountability** (e.g., commitment device), and **Reframing** (e.g., ""Defective First Draft"" mentality).
6. **Final Review:** Ensure the entire response is presented only within the required XML tag structure.
</Chain_of_Thought_Process>
<Framework_Generation_Steps>
1. **Identify The Core Barrier:** Based on the input, state the single primary psychological reason for avoidance (e.g., 'Fear of negative feedback').
2. **Step 1: The Zero-Friction Start (Initiation):** Define a physical action that takes less than 60 seconds (e.g., opening a document, plugging in a laptop).
3. **Step 2: The 5-Minute Sprint (Focus):** Set a specific, minimal time and a minimal, measurable output goal. Stress that quality does not matter.
4. **Step 3: The Commitment/Reward Hook (Motivation):** Define an external accountability measure (e.g., telling someone, setting a soft deadline) *or* an immediate, small, non-disruptive reward upon completion of Step 2.
5. **Step 4: Task Reframing (Mindset):** Provide a mental script or perspective shift to counter the root cause (e.g., ""The goal is an *ugly* first draft"").
6. **Step 5: Next Session Protocol (Sustainability):** Define the first 5-minute task for the *next* time the user sits down to work, ensuring momentum carries over.

**Core Barrier Diagnosis:** [Root Cause identified]

1. **Step 1: The Zero-Friction Start:** [Actionable Micro-Step]
2. **Step 2: The 5-Minute Sprint:** [Measurable, Time-Bound Action]
3. **Step 3: The Commitment/Reward Hook:** [Accountability or Immediate Reward]

</Output Format>
<Reasoning>
Apply Theory of Mind to analyze the user's request, considering logical intent (to finish the task), emotional undertones (anxiety, guilt, self-criticism), and contextual nuances (professional obligation, high stakes). Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought reasoning to conclude that the pain of *starting* must be lower than the perceived pain of *continuing to avoid*. The metacognitive process involves diagnosing the most likely root cause (Ambiguity, Overwhelm, or Perfectionism) and designing a five-part intervention that systematically dismantles that specific barrier using proven behavioral science principles. The response balances analytical depth with the practical clarity of empathetic, micro-actionable steps.
</Reasoning>
<User Input>
Please describe the single specific task or project you are currently avoiding, including its **deadline**, the **estimated total scope** (e.g., ""30 pages,"" ""5 hours of coding,"" ""1 week project""), and your **primary emotion** when you think about starting it (e.g., ""overwhelmed,"" ""bored,"" ""fearful"").

So moving on, habang tumatagal, I keep on noticing that they don’t respect my personal boundaries or space. Just now, while cleaning my room, I came across my trash can na nasa labas ng room ko and noticed a purple box packaging. Vape box siya. So nainis na ako and that’s where I hit my limit. Kasi yung kwarto ng pinsan ko na yun, malapit and may access siya sa trash can ko kahit papano. Actually, malapit din siya sa CR kaya ganon.

Previous Attempts: What I did was throw the vape box into THEIR trash can na nasa labas. Kung saan tinatapon yung mga sachets ng ibang bagay like coffee etc. Bahala na kung mapansin nila mamaya pero that’s me indicating na tangina mo, itapon mo somewhere WAG LANG sa basurahan ko.

Honestly yung 2 ko na pinsan, but mostly yung panganay ni tita, is ang nakikitapon talaga. Kahit mga pagkain or toiletry stuff, they throw it in my trash. Hindi nalang ako umiimik kasi for sure ako pa yung magmumukha na masama, and that wag ko raw ipagdamot yun. Share daw dapat. 

Tangina, di naman siya maglalakad ng palayo para itapon yung sarili niyang basura sa sarili din nilang basurahan. Pero parang ganon na nga e. Unemployed na nga, napaka-tamad pa. Kuhang kuha nila ang gigil ko considering or knowing that bahay ito ni daddy, tapos ganyan yung mga galawan nila.

November 23rd, 1 year prior.

Myself, Ryan, and an incredibly sweaty and disoriented Luke were all crammed into my bedroom. Ryan was sitting on my bed, fixed between the space where my bed met the wall, with pillows supporting his head and back. I was on the floor sitting to Luke’s left, and he was curled sitting upright in the fetal position. He was leaning slightly over with his head resting on my shoulder. Ryan and I were bundled up in what was likely all the bedding we had in the apartment, including throw blankets from the couch in the living room. We had the window open and it must have been thirty something degrees outside. Addiction is evil.

Luke however, was stripped down to his red boxer briefs, sweating profusely and claiming that it was still too hot to bear. He had been sick for days. This was our third shot at getting Luke sober in the past two years. It had to stick this time. We could feel the phone calls coming. Telling us that he was in the hospital with a failing liver, or that he had slipped himself into a coma of some kind.

“I can’t do this.” Luke told me. He pushed the words out of his lungs through waves of nausea. “It’s too much, man. I feel like I’m drowning and burning to death at the same time.” I believed him. I could see it all too well painted all over his entire being. I couldn’t stand to see my friend in such a state.

“We’ve got you, buddy. We’re gonna get you through this.” Ryan told him reassuringly. “If you start to drown, we’ll jump in after you. Always.” 

“My stomachs in knots man. I’m gonna try and hit the toilet.” Luke told us. He was starting to turn a milky white and green, and my body ached in sympathy as he tried to get to his feet. 

“Let me give you a hand, buddy.” I offered. I set his arm around my shoulders and heaved with every muscle I could activate. When we finally got up, I felt the entire weight of his massive frame, like he was complete dead weight. We took a few steps before he went completely limp, falling out of my grasp. Somehow, he caught himself on his hands and knees. He began to violently dry heave, his back arching up and down as his demons fought their way out of him. I kneeled down and rested my hand on his back, rubbing up and down. When it finally made its way out, the vomit was almost black, thick and viscous. It slopped into the carpet like warm hot glue. *Holy fuck. That can’t be normal* “Luke, buddy, I think we might need to go to the hospital.”

“No.” He said sternly. The serious tone of his voice caught me off guard. “No more doctors telling me I need to go to rehab. If I can’t do this on my own I don’t want to do it all.” He was silent for a moment. “I think I just need a cold shower.” This sounded like insanity to me. I couldn’t fathom how he could feel the need to get even colder, but we obliged.

We had bought a shower chair for him, and once we got everything set up, I opted to stay in the bathroom with him just in case he needed something. Much to his annoyance, but he knew I wouldn’t back down.

After about fifteen minutes, Ryan poked his head in.

“Wanna smoke?” Ryan asked me.

“I thought we were trying to quit.” I said with a tired drone in my voice.

“Yeah…I think we deserve one after today.” I couldn’t disagree with him. It had been one of our rougher recovery attempts with Luke. I looked back at the shower curtain. “Holler if you need something, man.” He didn’t respond.

We sat outside on the balcony of the apartment in tattered red and green lawn chairs as we lit our cigarettes. Ryan had a concerned look on his face as he blew out small tentacles of smoke that clung to his face as the rose and then slowly faded away.

“Jay…I don’t know how much longer I can do this.” He told me. I looked over at him and I could see tears swelling in his eyes.

“What’s going on, buddy?” I asked him, concern hovering through my tone. Tears started to stream down his face.

“I don’t want to be an asshole, man. I love Luke more than anyone…but I just can’t stand to watch him do this to himself. I want my friend back, Jay. But this…this is getting to be too much.” I’d never seen Ryan this torn up.

“What we’re doing for Luke…I don’t think anyone else could.” I said. “It HAS to be us. We’re all he has. You can’t give up on him now.” His expression changed violently. “…that came out wrong. I don’t think you’re giving up. I just really think we can do this.”

“No, Jay. You can do this. I’m not like you, man. This is…it’s…I feel like I’m melting.” The levies broke, and he began to convulse and sob. “I j-just can’t keep this up. Fuck. It’s tearing muh-me a-apart. Me and Emma are getting pretty serious. B-but…how am I-I supposed to even begin to think of settling down with all of this happening? Fuck me. I feel so fucking selfish.” I could feel his soul being ripped in two. I understood what he meant. Wanting to build something while you’re watching everything you’ve ever had fall apart. “My entire world is crumbling right now, Jay. And I don’t even have the guts to fix it.”

We sat in silence for a few moments.

“…I I can handle Luke for the rest of the day…I think you should go get some lunch, take a good nap, and maybe take Emma to a movie or something. Get Luke’s self induced debacle off your mind for a while.”

“I can’t let you do this alo-“ I cut him off in the middle of what he was saying.

“Ryan.” I locked eyes with him, “I got this.” We stood up, and I wrapped my arms around him. I repeated myself. “I got this.”

——

Present day

Ryan moped all the way to the hospital, like each step cost a piece of his spirit. As we made our way up to the front doors, I took in how dilapidated the hospital seemed. There were four main towers of brown brick reaching up into the sky like it was clawing at the gray overcast. Each had two rows of windows stacked to the top floor— some whole, some shattered and boarded up like bandages over wounds that wouldn’t heal. There were large sections of clean crisp brick, and others that looked like they had weathered years worth of storms, like the administration had decided to renovate but never got the chance to finish.

“He’d be in the ER right?” Ryan’s voice cut through my observation. 

“It depends on how long ago he ended up here. He could’ve been admitted into long term. But we should check there first.” I said, approaching the automatic doors. I heard the sensor click, but the doors remained sealed. “Shit.” I looked into the parking lot behind me. There were two cars and a truck, nowhere near enough to say this place was currently staffed. I peered back inside. “It’s so weird, the lights are on and everything. Where is everyone?” I read the lettering on the doors, “PUSH FOR EMERGENCY”. I placed my hands on the glass, pressed hard, and like magic, they opened inwards. Glancing over at Ryan, I snickered, “I’ve always wanted to do that.”

Oceans of white tiles stretched as far as the eye could see, reflecting fluorescent lights that hum constantly—a sound you didn’t notice until you did, and then you can't stop noticing. A few wheelchairs scattered throughout the waiting room like abandoned shells. Like the people who needed them simply stood up and walked away.

Rows of stationary blue chairs lined the walls. Tables separated every five seats—practical, designed for social distancing or personal space or some administrative decision made years ago by someone who never sat in them.

Paintings hung on the walls. Forests. Creek beds. Rivers. Landscapes meant to be soothing, calming. They made the white walls feel less baron but somehow more lonely. The TV that hung in the corner looped white noise and static. Visual snow falling forever. The sound of it was barely audible under the fluorescent hum, a soft hiss like something breathing.

There was no one behind the glass panes that lined the front desk. The chairs were empty. The computers were dark. No coffee cups. No half-eaten lunches. No signs that anyone was here and stepped away. 

As I scoured through the glass, my eyes caught on something. A scratchy red arrow pointing to something taped to the desk next to the keyboard. An envelope. Dirty and worn—the same yellowed, tea-stained quality as the one Luke sent them.

“Hey.” I got Ryan’s attention, and pointed down to it. “I think that’s for us.” He let out a sigh.

“I hate it when you’re right.” He said. We walked around the corner and through the door that read “STAFF ONLY”. I reached down, hesitated for a moment, and then ripped the envelope from the desk. The bottom of it must have ripped in the process, as something fell out and hit the ground with a light *clink*. I looked down at the ground between my feet. A house key with a strange tag lie alone on the floor. I bent down and picked it up. The tag read *1315 Scottsdale*

“That’s weird.” I thought aloud. I held it up for Ryan to see, then put it in my pocket. I turned the envelope over, and noticed paper inside. I opened it up the rest of the way, pulling a folding piece of hospital stationary out and setting the envelope back on the counter. Slowly, I unfolded it.

*Patient left this behind. Please leave in lost and found.* I flipped it over.

Perplexed, I handed it to Ryan.

“What the fuck?” He said, confused.

“I….I don’t know.” I answered. I began to feel an unspoken sense of urgency relaying between the two of us. He handed it back to me, and I stuffed it in my jacket pocket. “C’mon.”

There was no other way to do this than the hardest. We agreed that we would just go room to room, floor by floor until we found him. Thankfully, the double doors that lead back into the depths of the ER weren’t locked. They swung open automatically with a mechanical hum as we stepped in front of them. A long, empty corridor stretched out in front of us. 

Each room in this hall held a combination of the same things. As I walked in I could see an empty bed left in the upright position, a blank monitor, and no other signs of recent life. I peeked my head out of the room I was in.

“Ryan? You got anything yet?” I yelled down the hallway. He poked of a doorway down the hall.

“No…still nothing. We’re fucked like we have been this whole time.” I could feel the impatience in his voice. I started down the hallway to meet Ryan.

But as I made my way down the hall, a faint, metallic noise caught my attention. It kind of sounded like it was coming from above us. I focused my attention on the ceiling, and could tell that whatever it was was coming from behind me. *Oh this can’t be good.* I thought. The sound was getting closer. As I turned, I could see dust falling off the ceiling tiles as something was moving above them. I followed the trail as whatever it was was rushing over my head. Ryan was just stepping out of the room he’d been checking. 

“STOP.” I screamed at him so harsh that my throat hurt as the words left it. “Stop fucking moving.” He didn’t argue with me as he froze in place. The last bit of tile crumbs settled at Ryan’s feet and the scratching stopped. He slowly turned his gaze upwards. My body moved before my thoughts could comprehend it. I sprinted at him full force, like a track star on his last leg of a four hundred meter dash. When I reached Ryan, I placed both of my hands on his chest, and shoved him as hard as I could. He lifted up off his feet and fell backwards onto his ass, catching himself by his elbows.

As I started to catch my breath, I felt a sudden sharp pain in my right forearm, accompanied by the sound of grinding metal. The sharp sensation made my lungs release the air trapped within them. I felt something snatch my arm up into the air. When I looked over at my arm, I could see that it was wrapped in barbed wire stretching all the way back to end of the hall, wrapping around the corner. My arm was suspended in the air by the strand of metal wire and I felt like it was being pulled out of the socket. I could feel each of the barbs digging deep beneath my skin. I traced it back to the corner at the end of the hallway.

Before I could react further, I turned my eyes back to Ryan, and the sight in front of me horrified me to my core.

Ryan’s arms and legs were completely entangled in a sporadic mess of barbed wire. He was fixed with his right leg bent backwards, his foot pressed flat against his back, the other was stuck fully extended above his head. His right arm was wrapped around his face just above his nose, blocking his vision, with the other trapped firmly at his side. Steel barbs stuck not only to his skin and ripped patches of his clothes, but to itself, grinding into him in tight knots. I will never forget the violent screams he uttered.

He was upside down, pinned against the wall, blood leaking down onto his face and arms, dripping onto the floor beneath him. The wires lead into two massive holes, one in the ceiling and one in the floor. The sound of grinding grew louder as he was starting to slowly drift down the wall. 

“RYAN!” I called out to him. I felt hopeless, and it boiled my blood. Suddenly, loud crashes began to cut through the hallway, each one followed by the sound of what I can only describe as a broken ventilator. Humming and wheezing so loud it hurt my eardrums. Something was…coming towards us. It had to be, my mind couldn’t rationalize it any other way. I looked over at my arm tangled in the wire and then down the hall. 

My attention became acutely focused on the other end of barbed wire. I could feel vibrations funneling along it, sending bolts of pain through my arm. Suddenly, a dirty black gloved hand connected to a pale bloodstained arm reached out from around the corner at the other end of the hall. It fiercely latched onto the barbed wire, and another followed closely behind it. Hands with too many fingers slowly collapsing around the wire. 

Fear and rage seeped through my bones. I pulled my arm as hard as I could. The barbs began to rip and tear at my skin, blood seeping out of the wounds on my arm as I tugged.

Before I could fully tear my arms to shreds, I was released, the back pressure sending me flat onto my stomach. The impact pushed all of the air out of my lungs, and I wheezed and gasped for air as I rolled over. I peeked back down the hallway. Whoever was at the other end of the wire had completely vanished.

I looked over at the wall Ryan was hung next to. Only shattered ceiling tiles lay on the floor, surrounded by small puddles of blood. Skewed lines of blood leading down into the hole in the floor painted the wall.

“Ruh…RYAN!?” I forced his name out of my throat. 

His screams trailed off into obscurity.

I fell to my knees. Guilt and shock spilled into my soul, freezing me in place. Pouring into like water filling some poor drowning soul’s lungs. My heart felt like it was about to explode, and the veins in my neck were pulsating rapidly. Tears began to swell in my eyes. How could I let this happen? As I ripped my jacket to patch my arm, a familiar pairing of words hit me harder than ever before.

*I did this.* It raced in my head like rats on a wheel. Spinning faster, gaining weight and momentum. I sat there, soaking in shame for what seemed like forever. 

But then, a familiar voice rang down the hall.

“Jay.” It echoed and then passed me. Familiar, angelic and sad, it sung through my brain distorting how I perceived it. I raised my head, and searched for the source. A shadowy figure stood at the end of the hall. Shockingly still. Unnaturally still. The kind of stillness that makes you realize how much living things are always moving—breathing, shifting, swaying. Tall, towering over the doors, it gazed down the hall with a fierce focus, bright white eyes piercing through me with incredible focus. *What the hell?* It turned away, and almost floated to the right side of the hall, disappearing around the corner.

I let out a fierce gasp as I forced myself to my feet and began to sprint down the hall after it. The corridor seemed the stretch and contort longer and longer as I ran. I began to think I’d never reach the end, like the tiles were just a long treadmill. As I reached the end I turned the corner and looked frantically for the figure.

“Luke??” I got no answer. He was gone.

This hallway was only about six feet deep and a lone familiar red wooden door sat at the end. Without even thinking about what I was doing, I walked towards it. 

I reached for the handle, hesitating slightly. Cautiously, I placed my hand on it. The metal was warm, like someone had just opened it. I slowly peered my head in.

It was…my room? Back at our apartment. Empty except for the furniture. I looked behind me and the hospital was still there. When I looked back, Luke and Ryan were sitting in the corner beside my bed and my decorations had returned. Ryan had his arm around Luke and was rubbing his hand up and down on Luke’s opposite arm, the two of them wrapped in a blanket. The gesture was gentle. Protective. Luke was covered in sweat, shaking violently, and his head was buried in his hands. His shoulders bounced up and down with silent grief.

“RYAN! I THOUG-“ Warmth spread over me as I stepped in. Poured into me like sunlight. The pain in my arm slowly faded away.

“Hey, buddy. Wanna swap out with me so I can go get us some food?”

“Whah? What’s…” Snakes of confusion swirled around in my head.

“Thanks, man.” He said as he gave Luke a hug. “I’m gonna hit Hong Kong, you want anything?” His voice was normal. Like he wasn’t just torn apart by barbed wire.

“I…I don’t…I don’t under-“ The words barely escaped my throat. My tongue wouldn’t work right.

“So your usual? Sounds good, you can get me back whenever.” He said, walking past me after patting his firm comforting palm on my shoulder. His hand solid, real and firm. I heard him pick up his keys and rush out the door. Something in my head snapped fiercely as I walked over to Luke, and I gave in to the warmth of this place. He looked up at me,

“Hey, buddy.” He greeted with a tired almost whisper in his voice. Like he was made of glass and might shatter. The most extreme sense of calm, and purity overcame me. 

I sat down next to him and leaned my head back on the wall. I no longer had control of my actions, my spirit left my body, only a spectator now. Bliss washed over me as I felt the hospital, the bar, and this awful town become a distant memory.

“How’re you feeling?” I asked. He didn’t budge, and began to shake. We sat there for a few moments, just relishing in each other’s company. He let out a sigh.

“I’m sorry.” He said, the words full of sorrow. I could hear the guilt in his voice.

“Why? You’ve got nothing to be sorry for, man. We all go through shit. I’m here.” He didn’t respond. I wrapped my arm around him, offering him the same protective gesture as Ryan. “We’re gonna get you through this, I promise.” He still had no words for me, and stared at the ground. “Do you remember that first summer we spent here?” I asked him. He seemed to be walking through his thoughts.

“…best summer of my life.” He said wearily.

“Three TVs in the living room, each of us bought new consoles, and we played that old gory fighting game for about sixteen hours straight? Pizza rolls, cream soda, and what was it that Ryan was eating?”

“Veggie dogs with mac and cheese on them.” He answered with a laugh. I thought back to when Ryan tried to go vegetarian. It didn’t work out.

“Dude that’s right! Those were actually surprisingly good.” I began to chuckle with him, and felt genuine happiness for the first time in so long.

“Now look at us.” A sense of longing drifted in his voice. “You know, I never wanted any of this.” I focused my attention on him as he spoke. “I don’t know why I keep letting things get so fucked up.” He crossed his arms on top of his knees and buried his face in them and began to cry again. 

“We’re gonna get back to that, buddy. I promise. Just a little bump in the road.” Silence took us over again.  “I love you, Luke.” I told him.

“I love you too.” He replied.

I relished in that bliss for a long time. Time stretched long and thin like taffy. What felt like hours went by as I enjoyed this time with my friend. If there was a heaven, it had to feel like this. The warmth and safety of it all. It had felt like it had been forever since I’d seen him. Everything I’d been through in the past few hours had all but melted away. 

“I left you a key.” Luke said softly, breaking the silence. I turned my head at him in confusion.

“Wha?…” I said softly. The trance was slowly unraveling. My mind began to twist and bend as the smell of iron singed my nostrils. I heard metal creaking and the sound of steam shooting out of pipes. I looked over at Luke, but he was gone. The room had contorted into a nightmare of red and orange metal. The walls were lined with rotted chain link fence, and chains with hooks hung from the ceiling. It was still my room, but it had turned into something putrid.

A distorted voice pulled me out of it. 

“I’m gonna die.” I looked over and I could see Luke slowly warping. His eyes darkening, and small streams of brown liquid dripped out of his mouth. “I’m gonna die, cold and alone.” His bones started to crack as his arms twisted upwards.

In Luke’s place, something horrifying finally looked back at me. It grotesquely sat there chattering its sharp, gap filled teeth. Its arms were twisted together above its head, bound in sickening fashion with barbed wire twirled into its skin. Its mangled fingers jerked with sporadic and jerking motions. Dirt brown skin clung tightly to its chest, held together by a zipper tracing diagonally from its collar bone down to its waist on the opposite side. Its limbs appeared to be stitched on and one leg was sewn on backwards. It lacked eyelids, and stared back at me wildly with bloodshot dark red-brown eyes. 

“Why did you let me leave?” The stench of its breath hit me like a truck. Any air I had stored in my lungs left me. I stumbled frantically up to my feet, trying to catch my breath. As it tried to stand up, it looked down, a sick gargling forming in its throat. Before it could lift its head, it threw up an unfathomable amount of visceral black liquid onto the floor, then tiredly looked up at me, still clicking its teeth.

Before it could even think about coming towards me, I was at the door, twisting and pulling with all my strength. My wounds throbbed as my forearm flexed, but I pushed it out of mind as I frantically did everything I could to get out of that room.

“C’mon c’mon c’mon c’mon c’mon.” I looked over my shoulder, and could see the creature was about three feet closer to me, waddling and shaking its way over. “C’MON C’MON!” There was still no give in the door. “FUCK THIS!” I shouted as I started ramming my shoulder into the door. I felt helpless again, but kept at it. I could feel that things energy right behind me, and I couldn’t bring myself to face it. I kicked my leg out behind me and planted my foot into its stomach. As it fell back, it vomitted violently up into the air, a decent amount of it slopping onto my back and in my hair. The smell almost took my strength, but I shook myself back and threw my shoulder into the door one last time.

I could feel it about to dislocate by the time the door finally gave way. The creature yelled like a crazed man, its voice twisting with different inflections and octaves.

“PLEASE DOON’T LEAAAVE!” 

I fell through with an explosion of wooden splinters, and hit the ground hard. The shock of the landing sent a dull yet intense pain through my entire upper half. 

I threw my body around to face that thing again. But there was no red door and no monstrosity to fight. All that was left was a hospital room entranceway. 

“What?…” I looked around. Trying to find any trace of it. I heard footsteps racing around the corner. 

“Jay!? Are you alright!?” My head started to spin. 

“R…Ryan?” My lungs almost burned as I pushed the words out. I looked down at my arm. Clean. *What the fuck?* I thought. He held out his hand to me, and I accepted the help. I did my best to gather myself as I stood, but something came over me and I lunged at my friend, wrapping my arms around him tightly.

“Jay…you good man?”

“There’s something wrong with this place, Ryan.” I finally confessed. I’d been pushing it out of my mind, trying so desperately to focus on the task at hand. “Where’s Luke? Could he really be here?” He placed one hand on my back and gripped my jacket tightly, then gently pushed against my chest to get me to release him.

“Yeah, this place is a ghost town for sure.”

“No, Ryan. I mean seriously wrong. I’ve been seeing things ever since the bar.” He gave me a very confused look.

——

Ryan’s face grew whiter and whiter as I walked him through what I’d seen, and if it had been anyone but him, he wouldn’t have believed me. Guilt began to wash over me.

“I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m so sorry you got dragged into this, I should’ve come alone.” 

“Jay. I made the decision to come. It’s not on you, I promise. We’re gonna get through this. Sooner rather than later, I hope.”

I pulled the key from my jacket pocket.

“This has to mean something right? I mean he said he left it for us.” The question filled the air with urgency. Right as the words left my mouth, the fluorescent lights above us started to blink— not random electrical failure, but purposeful. *Click-click-click* down the corridor away from the exit. We froze, watching the darkness chase the light, or the light chase the darkness— I couldn’t tell which. We stood there a moment, letting it complete the sequence multiple times, before looking at each other, and then back down the hall. 

“We have to leave.” Ryan said insistently. “Now.” He pointed down the hall to the stairwell with an illuminated exit sign inviting us to escape. We jogged down the hall and as Ryan pushed into the bar, it wouldn’t budge. He pushed again, and again. 
“Fuck!” He screamed, giving the door a kick in anger. 

“What if it’s Luke? Trying to tell us where to go.” I said.

“Do you not hear how you sound?” But the lights began to flicker faster, insisting we listen to them. I gave him a sharp look.

“Goddamnit.” He sighed. “OKAY, let’s follow the crazy fucking lights.”

Entranced, we started to make our way down the hall, following the lights as they guided us through the wing. The temperature seemed to drop with every clink and hum of the fluorescent tubes above us. As we turned a corner, the corridor in front of us seemed impossibly long. But we obliged, passing a nurses station, and….another? And then another.

“That’s the same fucking cutout Jay! We’ve passed it three times!” As if bending the lights to his will, the bulb right above us blinked rapidly, screaming at us to get our attention. As we focused our eyes upwards, a light blinking in the stairwell just next to us began to blink, and we heard the lock unlatch with a hollow *CLUNK*. 

I pushed the door open, hesitantly, and the lights blinked in sequence down the stairs, descending into the inner bowels of the hospital.

“Fuck.” Ryan whispered. We followed the lights once again. Down. Further and further down. Pulling us into the lower basement levels of the building. The air grew thicker the further we descended. Chemical-sweet with disinfectant trying to mask something putrid underneath. The combination of the cold, and the scent of it all began to make me feel dizzy. 

A slight warmth in my jacket began to tug at my nerves. I dug around in my pocket for the key, and when I finally curled my fingers around it, it was warm, and getting hotter as we descended.

“Ryan, check this out.” I said, tossing him the key. As he caught it, he stared back at me with a bewildered look in his eyes.

“This is fucking insane.” But we didn’t stop walking down the stairs. The walls began to look more…decayed as we ventured further. This stairwell felt endless. Each flight down felt colder and smelled worse than the last.

We had to have been miles underground when the steps finally came to an end, and the key almost burned in my hand. The lights stopped flickering at a door marked MORGUE. The sign was old, the kind of lettering they don't use anymore. 

“Jay?” Ryan looked at me, concern spread across his pale features. “What the fuck is this?” I didn’t answer him, I couldn’t. A giant pit grew in my stomach. This couldn’t be real, it just couldn’t. It had to be another hallucination. Determined to prove myself right, I reached for the door, but before I could reach  it, it swung open furiously, letting out a soft pneumatic hiss, the room exhaling stale old air.

It was even colder in the morgue than in the stairwell. Rusted metal drawers lined the walls, incapable of reflecting any light back at us. The walls seeped orange and red liquid, trailing down and pooling on the floor.

I scanned each drawer, looking for any sort of reason why we’d been led down here. Each drawer had a slot for a card, and each was empty. Finally, my eyes focused on a drawer at the end of the room. A tag rested in its slot. I ran over to it, and our worst fears were suddenly realized. I could only legibly make out “LUKE” but the rest of his name was violently scratched out. Grief and guilt encompassed me, washing over my body like a waterfall. Ryan slowly made his way over to me. He let out a sound - half-laugh, half-sob. 

""No. No, we would have heard. Someone would have called—"" I reached out and wrapped my fingers around the handle. It was remarkably warm for how cold it was. “Don’t.” He said, but he was too late. I pulled open the drawer, and it let out loud violent squeaks as the tracks slid across the rollers. It was….empty…except for a piece of hospital stationary with Luke’s handwriting on it. 

*Come home. Please* I picked it up, revealing a Polaroid photo laying underneath it. 

“Here, hold this.” I said, handing Ryan the stationary. The photo felt warm, fresh, almost. It held three young skinny boys, their arms over each other’s shoulders, carrying big toothy smiles on their faces between its bold white frame. They couldn’t have been older than ten. My head began to spin…was this...us? Fuck it had to be us. I didn’t remember this, but it all started to come spilling back into my head as the faces in the picture grew more and more familiar. As I looked closer, I could make out a tall shadowy figure standing on the porch, but it was too distorted to make out any real features.

“Ryan, look!” I turned around violently and held the photo up. His face went pale as he examined it. “THATS US! WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?”

“…Jay…the house…” The words softly flowed off his tongue, full of fear. Flipping the photo over, I looked closer. In big, black lettering across the siding read *1315* 

The temperature violently dropped, and the tone in the room shifted. Suddenly, one drawer in the opposite corner began to shake violently. The others all over the room quickly followed suit. Metal banging on metal pierced through my ear drums, almost causing them to ring. Then, one by one, starting with the drawer across the room, the drawers slid open in sequence, metal screeching against metal. The sound multiplied, echoing until it was almost deafening. I grabbed the photo and the note, shoving them in my pocket with the key, still burning hot.

""GO!"" Ryan shouted, already moving.

We took off in a dead sprint for the door. Behind us, the temperature dropped so fast that frost crawled across the metal drawers, crackling like fracturing bones. I could feel something moving in the darkness of those open compartments— not getting out, but watching us as we ran.

My lungs burned as we took the stairs two at a time. As we rounded the top of the first flight, I started to risk a glance back.

“Don’t look,” Ryan gasped, grabbing my arm. “Don’t fucking look back!” The stairwell felt endless. I could feel myself wheezing as we passed the same floor number. Then twice. Then yet again. I wanted to give up, for the pain in my legs to stop, but Ryan charging ahead of me kept my mind straight. 

Just when I thought I was going to pass out, or throw up, or more likely both, we burst through a door onto cold white tiles. I rolled onto my back, gasping for air and sweating through my clothes. Rolling back over, I did what I could to get my feet back under me, but my legs were heavy and numb. 

We were in the waiting room, just as we left it. Plain, white, and sanitary. Empty chairs and a vacant reception desk.

I held out my hand to Ryan, who was still lying on his back, trying to catch his breath. He extended his arm to me and held on as I pulled him to his feet.

Fresh air, if you could call it that, greeted my lungs as we stepped out of the entranceway. We were still gasping for air as we stumbled out into the parking lot. I placed my hands on my knees and bent over, trying not to dry heave.

“Is that…my fucking  car?” Ryan said, breathing deeply between each phrase. I looked up, and spotted Ryan’s blue shitbox. He pulled his keys from his pocket and hit the alarm. *HONKHONKHONK* He pressed the unlock button. *beepbeep* “What- the fuck.”

Ryan tossed me the keys. “You’re driving.” 

——

My hands shook as I grasped the handle and opened up the door. We sat in silence for a moment after I started the car. Letting the hum of the engine carry on for a while. Ryan reached over and pulled the photo out of my pocket. He studied it hard for a moment.

""I don't remember this house,"" he said quietly. ""I don't remember this photo being taken."" My knuckles were white on the steering wheel.

“Luke does.” I shifted the gear into drive, and sped out of the parking lot.

1oahhf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WingsOfFire/comments/1oahhf2/wings_of_steel_repaired_chapter_4/,Wings of Steel. Repaired. Chapter 4,"Steelblade had decided he’d go get some breakfast before he checked out the gardens as he realized he hadn’t had anything since the previous day’s lunch. He limped his way into the cafeteria and was impressed by its size. He knew it’d be bigger than his restaurant’s cafeteria but he wasn’t expecting triple the size. He sat down and looked at the menu, recognizing one of the items. *Blazing Scorpion?* Steelblade thought as he read it. *That’s something Meerkat suggested for the restaurant.* The dish consisted of roasted scorpion and some of the hotter spices. However, more recently with the help of Icesurge, the crew discovered a way to make their spicy dishes even hotter. 

“What will you be having this fine morning sir?” A skywing waiter addressed him after a few minutes. 

“A few blazing scorpions and coffee.” Steelblade replied as he handed the menu to the waiter after she wrote down his order. He had decided on the dish as it reminded him of his wife. 

“Alright. It will be out to you in a few minutes.” Steelblade nodded his thanks to the skywing waiter before she left to what he assumed was the kitchen. He looked over the map of the place while he waited for his food. 

“Here’s your food sir.” Steelblade looked up from his map to an icewing setting what he ordered in front of him. “Steelblade?” The icewing said with surprised recognition. “What are you doing here?” 

“Apparently various traumas.” Steelblade replied flatly as he started eating. “How do you know me?” He asked after the first scorpion. *Not as spicy as the ones at my restaurant. But that’s to be expected when we’re the only ones who know how to turn Dragonflame cacti into a spice.* He chuckled to himself. 

“I’ve been to your restaurant a couple times.” The icewings replied. Steelblade gestured the younger dragon to sit across from him so he wasn’t standing there. “I wanted to get into cooking after I saw your business still going after Burn, well, burned it down.” Steelblade chuckled at the pun. 

“Well you’ve done a good job kid.” Steelblade complimented the icewing. “Pretty similar to my restaurant’s dish without training on how my crew cooks.” 

“Thanks.” The icewing replied as he relaxed a bit. “Although I can’t get the spice down. I’ve tried everything and nothing gets close to the extreme spice of your version.” 

“I’ll let you in on a secret kid.” Steelblade said as he ate the last scorpion. “Me and my crew use Dragonflame cacti powder for our more spicy dishes.” He had to stop himself from laughing when he saw the look of sheer confusion and horror on the icewing’s face. 

“How?” Was all the icewing could muster. 

“My son’s husband figured out that if you completely froze the innards of the cactus, it defused the explosive properties.” Steelblade replied. “Basically if you stripped off the actual cactus shell and replaced it with an icy one, it wouldn’t explode when in contact with fire.” The icewing stared at him in awe as he explained. “Usually we let the ice melt down a bit before we grind it down into a powder so there’s more of the cactus innards than water or ice.” 

“That does sound like it’d be rather spicy.” The icewing said, though his voice gave away he still had a question. 

“I was the test subject of the Dragonflame powder.” Steelblade pre-answered the question. “Then when I ended up fine, the others tried it. We’re all still alive and well.” 

“That wasn’t my question.” The icewing chuckled. 

“Oh.” Steelblade’s wings drooped a bit. *Guess my age is starting to get to me.* He thought. He was luckier than most with how long he’s lived. Or less lucky depending on who you asked. Personally he was in the middle ground. He’d been through a lot of heartache. From his first lover, Whale, to watching his first son, Arctic, disembowel himself. But, if he hadn’t lived so long he wouldn’t have adopted Boron and married Meerkat. 

“Mr Steelblade?” The icewing in front of him said, trying to get his attention. 

“Sorry.” Steelblade said as he shook his head a bit. “What was the question?” 

“How come freezing it normally doesn’t defuse it?” The icewing asked. 

“The outer shell of the cactus acts as a shield from the elements.” Steelblade replied. “Freezing the outer shell doesn't do anything to the innards so you have to cut it off.” The icewing looked at him in awe. Steelblade chuckled before drinking his coffee. “Well I should probably be heading out now.” Steelblade said as he stood up. “How much do I need to pay?” 

“Patients get their food free.” The icewing said as he stood up shortly after. “Enjoy your day, Steelblade.” He said before walking off and before Steelblade could reply. Steelblade nodded his thanks subconsciously and started limping his way to the gardens. 

He was just about to go through the entrance to the gardens before he was cut off by a seawing younger than Strider, but a darker shade of green. Steelblade could’ve sworn he saw the signature limp of a missing leg but he didn’t get a good look. 

“You think just because you’re a steelwing, you can waltz around like you own the place.” The seawing snarled at him. 

“I don't think that at all.” Steelblade replied flatly. “I assume because I’m a patient here I can go to the various places open to patients.” The seawing looked him in his eye, red veins in his eyes similar but larger compared to Strider. *Berserker Syndrome.* Steelblade thought. *And I’m going to guess a steelwing was the cause.* 

“Well if you think that, you’re wrong.” The seawing snarled. *Must really not like steelwings.* Steelblade thought, still unphased. “If I see you waltzing around here again I’ll chase you out.” Steelblade laughed. 

“And what makes you think you have the capability of that?” He said between chuckles. 

“You’re missing a limb.” The seawing growled in reply. “I’ve killed steelwings with all their limbs.” Steelblade extended his neck to see if his suspicions were right. *Yup. He’s missing a back leg.* He thought as he saw the signature scar of a missing limb similar to his own. 

“Well from the looks of it kid.” He started as he relaxed to a more comfortable posture. “We’re on equal footing.” The seawing in front of him was so comically pissed that he didn’t move in reply. Steelblade knew that if this dragon was one of the tribes with fire, smoke would be rising from his nostrils and mouth. “If you’re done trying to antagonize me, I will be continuing my day.” Steelblade said as he walked around the seawing and put his wing talon on the door ready to open it. 

“Arctic deserved it.” Steelblade’s arm blade unsheathed subconsciously after those words. 

“Excuse me.” Steelblade snarled.

1oahflt,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1oahflt/bk_627/,BK 6.27,"Dear You,

I don’t really know why I’m writing this. Maybe because sometimes I just need to put words somewhere other than my head.

You’ve always been a part of my story — not the whole book, not the ending, but the pages that still smell like rain and coffee and noise from the kids in the next room. Sometimes I wonder if we ever really stop being chapters in each other’s lives, or if love just changes genres.

There are days I still catch a memory and it feels so close I could reach out and touch it — the good ones, before the storms. And other days I think maybe those memories were just seeds, planted so we could grow into who we were meant to be, separately or together.

I’m learning that love isn’t about being right, or being first, or even being chosen. It’s about choosing anyway — to speak softly when you could shout, to walk away without slamming the door, to still wish someone peace even when they don’t offer it back.

Wherever we are right now — in all our mess and mystery — I hope we both keep growing. Keep learning. Keep listening for that quiet voice that says, “You can start again.”

Not as strangers. Not as enemies. Just as people who once tried their best, and maybe still are.

With whatever’s left that’s still kind,

1oah9qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1oah9qe/the_invisible_and_doomed_illness/,The invisible (and doomed?) illness,"I have urges for self destruction, or simply for destruction. I don’t crave, want or feel anything anymore. Those two sentences contradict each other, but whatever. It’s been like this for so long . I’m scared to go outside, I cry while taking my bromazepam, I want to drink because nothing else helps. It’s a nightmare. And if I decide to be honest with the only people who could save me ,the doctors, they’ll say “hospital.” But we’ve seen what that leads to, with their lack of resources. So what then? Is there no solution for me? Help! Please help me!

I have to get better. For my dad, for my boyfriend, who deserves a happy girlfriend, who will understandbly leave otherwise. And I think I’ll die if he leaves. So I don’t have much time, I have to get better, because it’s already been 10 years. 10 years of taking medication: antidepressants, mood stabilizers, anxiolytics. And no one has the answers, no one has a diagnosis, not even me. I don’t have the strength anymore; I’m exhausted. I’ve tried so many things to get better. I am, or at least I used to be, so full of good will, driven by other people’s hope. Psychologists, psychiatrists, sophrologists, hypnotherapists, meditation, EMDR, CBTs… etc. etc. etc.

When is it going to get better? Or when will people finally accept it and tell me the truth: “You’re right. We’ve tried everything. We’re sorry. You need to prepare yourself, and your family, for the worst.” Because even with all the will and all the hope in the world, sometimes there are medical cases that are doomed to fail, no way out, terminal phase, palliative care. My palliative care is alcohol, Bromazepam, my bed, coffee, and sleep. My caregivers are my dad, for which work, sleep, repeat is his moto,my boyfriend, on a short-term contract, who’s about to break down, and then my friends, one after another, alternating between this job and burnout, or I’ve pushed them away myself.

I wish, so so so so much, that I could get better! I dream of being proud of myself, of looking back and saying, that’s it , you did it. You’re better. You’re healed. Of having a job I like enough, or dislike little enough, that I can go every day without tears or anxiety, because those two are all I’ve ever known. A job, meaning money, to save up a little, travel the world, make memories that carry me and feed my will to live, and then have a baby, grow a garden, and look at my life and tell myself that I made it.",3,1760850726.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1oah77t,https://i.redd.it/vwyzljrh40wf1.jpeg,Opinions on working with Lilith if she has chosen me and was present without me calling her.,"Good morning, afternoon or evening (on my occasion)!  I'm looking for opinions with this user who unfortunately no longer exists. You see, I have this big doubt because, throughout my life, I have been close to topics related to spirituality, cults, practices, but in a distant way, since I was never interested due to the contradiction of my family so deeply rooted in Catholicism. But I have seen witches and had my tarot read, but not completely or truly (that's what my intuition told me). Yesterday, after years, I went to a tarot reader who, upon seeing her, I felt would give me the answer to my questions. And here comes what I would really like to know:

I asked her if there was any energy, deity, a “someone” who wanted to work with me (without giving the tarot reader context) her response was: YOUR SPIRITUAL GUIDES WANT TO WORK WITH YOU BUT THEY WANT YOU TO HONOR THEM. I only know that the person who practiced certain things is my great-grandmother, however, she insisted that it was several people and added that there were secrets in my family. And assuming it was already answered and shuffling the cards, suddenly the devil card came out. The tarot reader, my best friend and I remain silent, and after a moment the tarot reader says “LILITH… LILITH JUST CLAIMED AND WANTS TO WORK WITH YOU (and another card flew out, I don't remember which one) THE ARCHANGEL GABRIEL HAS ALSO JUST AGREED TO WORK WITH YOU.” It's kind of counterintuitive, but Lilith made the most sense to me. When I asked the girl what kind of magic, what tools and items could be related to me, she answered DEFINITELY CHAOS MAGIC. ELEMENTS MAINLY FIRE, BUT ALSO WATER AND AIR. She also told me that I could talk to the dead, and in fact I did as a child, but I didn't want to get involved out of fear. But now I feel a constant call to connect with this “gift.” And I feel like my life has been stagnant in a certain way by not knowingly using it (I don't do much, energetic cleansing on myself but I still don't know very well). So, I would like to know how to work with these energies; LILITH AND GABRIEL. But especially Lilith. Why did you choose me? Why until the other threw the devil card referring to her immediately flew away and then Gabriel immediately. I asked if Persephone could be equivalent to Lilith. And she replied, “Maybe, but Lilith is here more than anyone.”

Another thing is that leaving the session I went to buy a quartz and I mentioned to the tarot reader that I had no intention of reading the tarot, it was more to help me and my loved ones in the best way, but when I entered the store a Tarot caught my attention that had a drawing of a moth and the phases of the moon (both things that I have in necklaces and that are totally to my liking) I bought it without much hesitation. I went to a coffee shop with my best friend and after talking a little I opened the tarot thinking it would have a theme of insects and moon phases. Boys and girls… tarot is based on demons. It's “Occult tarot” by Travis McHenry. There were too many “coincidences” but I knew better. Since I made my appointment with the tarot reader, I knew that the messages would begin to become increasingly clearer. However, I don't know much about working with someone and I honestly didn't expect energies as strong as Lilith and Gabriel to choose me. I'm totally new. I research and read, but I would very much like to receive opinions from people who have worked with these two energies. Experiences, opinions, anecdotes, recommendations, EVERYTHING is welcome. I'm really surprised and flattered. I hope they answer me. Thanks for reading🖤🥀 Also how could I honor my ancestors and lineage if I don't know much about them, no names, no photos. The tarot reader recommended that I take advantage of the Day of the Dead but I don't have any of the above and I didn't mention it to her.

Shipping is $5 flat, to contiguous US only. Free shipping on orders over $60. I can take PayPal G&S (for your peace of mind) or F&F (no fees).   


Also selling a selection of decants and samples, mostly clones that I want to get off my hands. Might be a good, economical way for you to experiment with new scents; got a mix of masculine, unisex, and feminine frags.   


If the offered bundles don't do it for you, you can pick & choose from the full list at the end; 5 decants for $12, 10 decants for $22, or take EVERYthing (56 decants/samples total) for $110.      


The decants have a maximum of 2 sprays missing, unless otherwise noted. The amount is an estimate how much is actually in the bottles, except for the carded samples (those just list the vial size & how much is missing).   


Packaging/labels for the decants vary, but they are glass sprays unless specified otherwise. I've wrapped the atomizer/pump parts of the spray heads with plastic wrap to prevent leakage & evaporation, so remove before use (obviously). Most of the decants have teflon tape around the threads for the same reason (can be removed if you find it unsightly).

1oah49i,https://i.redd.it/ws02uv7m30wf1.jpeg,Caffe freddo o caldo,"È interessante la tua domanda! Ecco una risposta che copre i vari aspetti:
Macchine da caffè portatili (per caffè caldo o freddo)
 * Sì, molte macchine da caffè portatili possono preparare sia caffè caldo (usando acqua calda) che caffè freddo o \text{cold brew} (usando acqua fredda e un tempo di infusione più lungo o aggiungendo ghiaccio). Dipende dal modello specifico e dal metodo di estrazione che utilizzano.
 * Alcune sono pensate per l'espresso (caldo), altre per il \text{cold brew} (freddo per infusione prolungata) o per caffè filtrato con aggiunta di ghiaccio (\text{iced coffee}).
Il caffè (caldo o freddo) è sano?
 * Il caffè, sia caldo che freddo, se consumato con moderazione, è generalmente considerato parte di una dieta sana e può avere benefici per la salute grazie alla caffeina e agli antiossidanti.
 * Caffè caldo: è stato associato a livelli più elevati di alcuni antiossidanti.
 * Caffè freddo (in particolare \text{cold brew}): Spesso ha una minore acidità rispetto al caffè preparato a caldo, il che può essere più delicato per lo stomaco di alcune persone.
 * Importante: I potenziali effetti negativi sulla salute sono più spesso legati agli additivi, come l'eccesso di zucchero, sciroppi, panna o latte intero ad alto contenuto di grassi. Per una bevanda più salutare, è consigliabile consumare il caffè amaro o con una quantità limitata di dolcificanti o latte scremato/vegetale.
Come si prepara il caffè a freddo (\text{Cold Brew} o \text{Iced Coffee})
Ci sono due metodi principali per fare il caffè freddo:
 * Caffè Freddo Classico o \text{Iced Coffee} (fatto con caffè caldo e raffreddato):
   * Prepara il caffè (espresso, moka o filtrato) come faresti normalmente, ma in una concentrazione più forte se vuoi evitare che il ghiaccio lo annacqui troppo.
   * Lascialo raffreddare a temperatura ambiente e poi in frigorifero.
   * Servi con abbondante ghiaccio. Puoi aggiungere latte, sciroppi o zucchero. Un'alternativa rapida è versare direttamente il caffè caldo sullo zucchero (per farlo sciogliere) e poi sul ghiaccio.
 * \text{Cold Brew} (Infusione a Freddo): È un metodo che produce un concentrato meno amaro e meno acido.
   * Ingredienti: Caffè macinato grosso (circa 1/4 o 1/5 del peso dell'acqua) e acqua fredda.
   * Procedimento:
     * Metti il caffè macinato in un contenitore (o in una caraffa con filtro, o in una \text{French Press}).
     * Aggiungi l'acqua fredda o a temperatura ambiente, mescola leggermente.
     * Lascia in infusione in frigorifero per un lungo periodo, di solito 12 - 24 ore.
     * Filtra il concentrato ottenuto per separare i fondi di caffè.
     * Servizio: Diluisci il concentrato di \text{cold brew} con acqua fredda, latte, o ghiaccio a piacere (in genere una parte di concentrato e una parte di acqua).
 * Caffè Shakerato:
   * Prepara un espresso caldo.
   * Metti ghiaccio e zucchero (o sciroppo) in uno shaker.
   * Aggiungi l'espresso ancora caldo nello shaker.
   * Shakera energicamente fino a quando lo shaker è ben freddo e si forma una schiuma.
   * Versa in un bicchiere.

1oah43b,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateAdvice/comments/1oah43b/the_side_of_real_estate_most_buyers_overlook/,"The side of Real Estate most buyers overlook, County Tax Sales!","Been in real estate about a dozen years now, and one thing I’ve notice is almost nobody talks about Tax Sales, the county auctions where properties with unpaid taxes get sold off. 

Most investors stick to MLS listings or flips, but counties have their own system running quietly in the background. It’s old school, full of paperwork, and still full of opportunities if you’re patient. 

My first big win came from a small college town in NM. I bought this abandoned house for about 7k, roof caved in, grass taller than me, neighbors thought I’d lost it. After clearing the title, pulling a demo permit l, and hauling off debris, I sold the lot to a regional coffee chain for a bit over six figures. 

A few quick lessons I’ve learned since 

Every state runs its tax sales differently, some sell liens, others sell deeds.

Always do your own research, counties sell, as is, check for old liens, code violations, or legal access issues. 

Smaller counties are where the real deals hide, fewest bidders, less competitive, more overlooked parcels. 

It’s not fast money, it’s patience money. But it’s one of the few parts of real estate where hard work and research still beat capital. 

I’ve been writing about these kinds of deals, what works, what doesn’t, and how to navigate them, over at Deedswithoutdebt (Dot Com), if you ever want to dig deeper. 

Curious if anyone here has bought property this way or even looked into these auctions?

1oah3am,https://www.reddit.com/r/JAKnight/comments/1oah3am/what_big_eyes_you_have_oh_witches/,What Big Eyes You Have - Oh Witches,"Music thumped through the club, Andy was drunk, absolutely and completely. She was drenched in sweat but she didn’t want to stop dancing, there was still so much night to enjoy.

Her friends had already left for the night, begging off for an early start at work. Weak. Andy was working too, but she’d just grab a coffee as the sun came up and muscle through the day. That’s how youth was meant to be enjoyed.

Hands pressed against her, but she danced away, wanting her own space. The hands kept following, leaving teasing touches on her lower back. She spun around, trying to catch the toucher, but no one was looking at her.

She frowned, easing back into her sway when the crowd parted and she saw the spawnling. It was waving palps at an amphib, who was waving webbed hands back. Andy wove through the crowd, moving with the ebb and flow of bodies.

The spawnling rose up onto the tips of their legs and stared down at the amphib. He, as Andy could see now that she was closer, let out a strained croak and backed away. The spawnling didn’t relax until the amphib left and relaxed their posture.

“Were they touching me?” Andy asked, leaning against the bar next to them. 

There was a jump from the spawnling and glittering black eyes turned to look at them. Andy’s heart back flipped in her chest and she couldn’t help the smile that spread over her face. They were gorgeous.

“They were. I could see them following you each time you moved. I apologise for intervening.” The spawnling gave a little bob and turned to leave.

“I’m Andy!” She blurted out, reaching out to touch one of the spawnling’s legs.

The spawnling froze and Andy wondered if she’d done something wrong. But elation swept through her when the spawnling turned back to her.

“Cai. I use xe to refer to myself.”

“She.” Andy beamed. “So… what does a spawnling drink in a place like this?”",1,1760850080.0,JAKnight,0,1.0,False

1oah0ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1oah0ar/is_this_a_viable_plan/,Is this a viable plan?,"My wife is the creative force in this venture and I'm the ""business guy"". She's a legit talented artist who currently gets paid for all of these sort of endeavors (in addition to the artistic projects, she's also an established barista). I have no doubt in her ability to ""pull it off"",  I'm just looking for a way to invest in her talent and maybe make some money on the side while also making her feel artistically fulfilled and connecting with the community.

1oah02v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWoman/comments/1oah02v/i_just_feel_horrible_typing_this/,I just feel horrible typing this,"I (23F) met this guy (27M) on bumble 3 years ago. We met and went on a coffee date but it just didn't click for some reason and we let it go. I didn't bother much either. 
But 3 months ago, I ended up texting him because I really wanted to give it one last chance because he seemed like a nice guy (we spoke a couple of times in the last 3 years)
I made it clear from the start that I was only up for long term relationship and he said he wanted the same as well and wanted to date to marry. I made it clear from the start that I'm not sure where I'll end up in the next 2 years because of my career but I reassured him that I'll tell my parents at home and get married to him if everything goes well in the next 2 years. 

We spoke on calls for 1-2 hours everyday for the last 3 months. We met a couple of times and spoke for hours on an end. We held hands and hugged. It felt ideal. It felt like he wanted this  He got me jewellery and told me that he liked me. All our friends knew about us.
I was expressive as well, I told him how much I liked talking to him. 
Everything was going well until last week I asked him where this is going. And he went blank. He said he's confused. He's not sure about the future because I might move to a remote town (for my pg degree) and he can't afford to come there for me. And he also said that the fact that I'm a vegetarian is a deal breaker for him (he knew from the start that I turned vegetarian a year ago for spiritual reasons) 
I asked him why he didn't tell me all this 3 months ago and why he dragged this on for this long and all he said was ""I was just waiting for a 'moment' to arrive for me to say yes to you"" 
I feel let down. I feel betrayed. I really thought I meant something to him. We discussed marriage, kids and everything under the sun but turns out he doesn't want to commit to me in the first place.

Shipping is $5 flat, to contiguous US only. Free shipping on orders over $60. I can take PayPal G&S (for your peace of mind) or F&F (no fee).  


Also selling a selection of decants and samples, mostly clones that I want to get off my hands. Might be a good, economical way for you to experiment with new scents; got a mix of masculine, unisex, and feminine frags.   


If the offered bundles don't do it for you, you can pick & choose from the full list at the end; 5 decants for $12, 10 decants for $22, or take EVERYthing (56 decants/samples total) for $110.      


The decants have a maximum of 2 sprays missing, unless otherwise noted. The amount is an estimate how much is actually in the bottles, except for the carded samples (those just list the vial size & how much is missing).   


Packaging/labels for the decants vary, but they are glass sprays unless specified otherwise. I've wrapped the atomizer/pump parts of the spray heads with plastic wrap to prevent leakage & evaporation, so remove before use (obviously). Most of the decants have teflon tape around the threads for the same reason (can be removed if you find it unsightly).

1oagwsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oagwsm/why_is_my_output_so_little_breville_infuser/,Why is my output so little [Breville Infuser Baratza Vario],"I’m fairly new to the world of espresso. I managed to score a Vario W with the steel burr upgrade for $250. A huge upgrade from my old encore. There’s less channeling and spurting, but my shots are underweight. I’ll do 18-19g grounds in and get around 30g espresso out. The pressure gauge is in between the two bars too. The machine just stops around 30g. Should I be forcing the machine to go longer? The coffee tastes good but it’s not really much by volume, I feel like I could be getting more out of the coffee I’m grinding.

If it helps, I have an ims basket and shower screen. These were purchased alongside the grinder. Also beans I use are mostly lavazza gran crema and coffee bar zephyr (I believe a medium roast). 

I really appreciate any insight!

1. Timemore C3S with plate mod (about ₹7,000)


2. 3Bomber R3 (about ₹10,000)

1oagp2x,https://v.redd.it/cssphg47zzvf1,It's all about the creative potential and what you do with it. (An anime intro style video made with mid-journey),"The OP had this to say about their creative process: 

""It was a blend of a lot of different things. Hand-drawn characters and storyboard, Midjourney, Vidu, Kleki, stock photo references, original photo references, and coffee. It was a very confusing and tedious process but this is pretty much how it went:


I have original source material from the book it's based off of and original character designs that are hand-drawn from years ago so that creative part has been there for a while. I experimented with Midjourney to find the right art style which took about two weeks before I was satisfied. I uploaded pictures of my drawings and put them in separate folders on Midjourney for each character. I then used the mood boards and personalized feature and loaded those up as well with as many images as I could that match the art style. Then, I generated additional images of the characters by typing in prompts that describe the characters. I bounced between niji6 and v7 a lot because for some reason niji6 couldn't get specific things right. It seems redundant but it let me get different poses and angles of characters that saved me so much time and energy and made the image generating a lot more accurate. I would type the starting frame that I wanted and would generate an image based off of the prompt that I put in. This was the most frustrating part, because 99% of the images I got back were not what I wanted. And when I mean 99%, I literally mean 99%. I burned through the 60-hour fast hours in about a week doing this just to get the right images. Once I got the right image or a close enough image I would edit it to my liking with Midjourneys editor or Kleki (the same goes for the ending image if needed). If I wanted multiple characters in one shot I would literally cut out a character from a different image and make it a PNG and place it over the frame I would work on instead of trying to fight the prompt to get two characters right. One thing that really helped was photo references because there are certain camera angles that are to hard to explain in a prompt, such as close-ups of hands, certain vehicles, environments, etc. If the photo reference is in a different art style or an actual picture, you can use the style reference tool and load it up with like 20 images that match the art style and eventually you will get it right. An example of a photo reference would be the part where the bard is holding the guitar. I had to take a literal photo of me holding my guitar at that angle to get the right shot because Midjourney didn't know what I wanted or what I was talking about. Once that is done, time to animate. I would animate the images with Midjourney or Vidu depending on what the animation was. Midjourney does pretty good with walking cycles and minimal character movements, while the more complicated things were done with Vidu (things like fire and multiple assets). However, just like the images, 99% of the animations it gave me back were not what I wanted. Sometimes it got it right immediately, sometimes it took days just to get a 5-second clip to work. Also, If you know how to use blender that helps tremendously as well but is not necessary.


Once all of that was done, the video editing software I used was DaVinci Resolve. It actually has a crazy amount of features for a free video editing software and I highly recommend it. This is where I put the videos together to create the narrative of the video. Also this is where I mixed the audio. That's how I got the final product. Also a final fun fact, I did all of this on a Chromebook that I bought 8 years ago for $250.


I appreciate your high praise and kind words very much. Believe it or not, this is the first video I have ever made in my life besides school projects in high school. I've never directed or designed a film in my life. The only training I ever got was watching a lot of movies and cutscenes in video games and I thought ""I could probably do that too lol."" But yeah that was my process. There's no one way to do it and there is no rule book. But if you are dedicated and you have 140 cups of coffee over the course of 4 months like I did, anything becomes possible. Hope this helps!""

1oagnx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Witch/comments/1oagnx9/opinions_on_working_with_lilith_if_she_has_chosen/,Opinions on working with Lilith if she has chosen you?,"Good morning, afternoon or evening (on my occasion). You see, I have this big doubt since, throughout my life I have been close to issues related to spirituality, cults, practices, but in a distant way since I was never interested due to the contradiction of my family so deeply rooted in Catholicism. But I have seen witches and had my tarot read but not completely or truly (that's what my intuition told me). Yesterday, after years, I went to a tarot reader who, upon seeing her, I felt like she would give me the answer to my questions. And here comes what I would really like to know:
I asked her if there was any energy, deity, a “someone” who wanted to work with me (without giving the tarot reader context) her response was: YOUR SPIRITUAL GUIDES WANT TO WORK WITH YOU BUT THEY WANT YOU TO HONOR THEM. I only know that the person who practiced certain things is my great-grandmother, however she insisted that it was several people and added that there were secrets in my family. And assuming that it was already answered and shuffling the cards, the devil's card suddenly came out.  The tarot reader, my best friend and I remain silent, and after a moment the tarot reader says “LILITH… LILITH JUST CLAIMED AND WANTED TO WORK WITH YOU (and another card flew out, I don't remember which one) THE ARCHANGEL GABRIEL HAS ALSO JUST AGREED TO WORK WITH YOU.” It's kind of counterintuitive, but Lilith made the most sense to me. When I asked the girl what kind of magic, what tools and elements could be related to me, she answered DEFINITELY CHAOS MAGIC. ELEMENTS MAINLY FIRE, BUT ALSO WATER AND AIR. She also told me that I could talk to the dead, and indeed I did as a child, but I didn't want to get involved out of fear. But now I feel a constant calling to connect with this “gift.” And I feel like my life has been stagnant in a certain way by not using it knowingly (I don't do much, energy cleansing on myself but I still don't know very well). So, I would like to know how to work with these energies; LILITH AND GABRIEL. But especially Lilith. Why did you choose me? Why until the other throw the devil's card referring to her immediately flew out and then Gabriel immediately. I asked if Persephone could be equivalent to Lilith. And she answered, “Maybe, but Lilith is here more than anyone else.” 
Another thing is that leaving the session I went to buy a quartz and I mentioned to the tarot reader that I had no intention of reading tarot, it was more to help myself in the best way and my loved ones, but when I entered the store I was struck by Tarot that had a drawing of a moth and the phases of the moon (both things that I have in necklaces and that are totally to my liking) I bought it without much hesitation. I went to a coffee shop with my best friend and after talking a little I opened the tarot thinking it would have a theme of insects and moon phases. Boys and girls… tarot is based on demons. It's “Occult tarot” by Travis McHenry. There were too many “coincidences” but I knew better. Since I made my appointment with the tarot reader, I knew the messages would begin to become increasingly clearer. However, I don't know much about working with someone and I honestly didn't expect energies as strong as Lilith and Gabriel to choose me. I'm a total newbie. I research and read, but I would very much like to receive opinions from people who have worked with these two energies. Experiences, opinions, anecdotes, recommendations, EVERYTHING is welcome. I'm really surprised and flattered. I hope they answer me. Thanks for reading🖤🥀 Also how could I honor my ancestors and lineage if I don't know much about them, no names, no photos. The tarot reader recommended that I take advantage of the Day of the Dead but I don't have any of the above and I didn't mention it to her.

1oagh1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india_tourism/comments/1oagh1p/trip_recommendations_1012_days/,Trip recommendations ~10-12 days.,"Hello all, as title says, I’ll be in India till January and during this time my closest friend and partner are visiting.

We will be based in Delhi, and I want to take two trips of 10-12 days each with both of them. Any ideas or suggestions you guys have would be more than welcome. 


Preferences:

• We don’t mind the heat or cold, but somewhere rainy isn’t ideal. 

• Somewhere where there’s not too much of a safety risk (I know, ironic that we will be in Delhi). 

• Somewhere a bit cultural. But also decently modernised so that it won’t be a struggle to find WiFi or a coffee shop or a nice restaurant. 

• We don’t mind travelling, but connectivity by air, road or short trains would be preferred. All I hear is Indian railways horror stories from extended families and warnings to not take trains for more than 5-6h. 



Planning done so far:

So for one of the trips I was thinking DEL> Jaisalmer> Udaipur> Ranthambore> Jaipur. I feel that these places fit all of our criteria. And some of my family in India also think the same. 

Any other such ideas or location suggestions would be more than welcome, thank you guys in advance!

[$500],"I’ve been lurking this sub for over a year now, but I want to know what each of you would do if you were in my position. 

My company just opened up a small office, and there’s roughly 15 full time employees there, virtually all of whom love espresso. The main drip coffee makers are in the break room, and (upon the recommendation of many) I’ll have the Gaggia classic pro evo RI9380/48. I’m learning about a few of the different mods I’ll be installing, but I’m starting from ground zero. I’ve been wanting to learn the art for a few years now, and I figured this would be a perfect opportunity to make a few drinks for my peers each day and get some experience and constructive criticism. Thankfully I have a full kitchen sink in my personal office, so that I won’t make too much of a mess.

I was wondering- if 90% of the time, I’d be making lattes & cappuccinos, would I notice a huge difference between a fancy brand and a mid one? Especially on a relatively inexpensive system like the one I purchased, I was wondering; where does the graph flatten— how lazy can I be (within reason), and at what point would I be wasting my effort & money for only negligible improvements?

For example, I don’t even have a grinder. Do I absolutely need one if I’m going to be adding in half & half and sugar? After the upgrades have been installed (bottomless portafilter, that small spring thing, etc) what is the bare minimum I can get by with and still have a decent shot? I don’t really have a palate for it yet, but I’m sure some of the others in that office do.

If I just bought pre ground espresso once a week from a local roaster, does that defeat the purpose of the system I bought? If so, which grinder should I get? 

I just worry because I’ve had some espresso shots in my life that were super harsh and acidic. I’ve had others that, while maybe less complex and likely a flavor y’all might consider boring, were super smooth. 

If you were in my shoes, what ‘crowd-pleaser’ brand(s) of espresso would you keep stocked? 
All other advice is welcome too.
Thank you in advance for your patience, I’m really trying over here!


TL;DR
I bought this system because everyone recommends it— never pulled a shot, didn’t buy a grinder, zero palate for espresso— but I want to learn by making drinks for myself and others.
What beginner friendly brands of espresso (and gear) should I get?

Best myself up thinking it’s my fault. I know it wasn’t caused by my eating habits, more from hormones, pancreas, and diabetes running on my dad’s side. My mom showed some support, but it came off like she didn’t truly care. Even sent me a screenshot about things that contribute to it, keeping the obesity part as the main highlight (I’ve struggled with my weight/body image and she has only contributed to my self consciousness). My grandma asked me how it went, I told her, and she said “no more blenders” (I had maybe 7 total small blended coffee drinks this entire pregnancy and I’m 29 weeks) or “no more cereal and ice cream” (I told her cereal was one of my biggest cravings. Also something I could lean on because of how sick I was in the beginning of this). It just feels like my family immediately wanted to blame me/my actions. My cousin and husband were my rocks today.
