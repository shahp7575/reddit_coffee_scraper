Help rescue the victims of the cult leader!,"It‚Äôs a tragic but familiar scenario. Trump has wrecked the lives of his attorneys leaving them broken emotionally and financially.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has been disbarred. He is begging the courts for bankruptcy in order not to sell off his home and belongings for lawsuits brought against him. 
Two Georgia election workers obtained a $148 million defamation judgment against him for false allegations he made about them after the 2020 election.

It‚Äôs unlikely that Giuliani will be able to pay anywhere close to what he owes. In addition to the defamation sum, Giuliani is also on the hook for several additional outstanding debts. He is currently being sued by one of his former lawyers, Robert Costello, for lack of payment. 
In October, it was reported that the IRS had placed a lien on his Palm Beach condo. 
And the problems don‚Äôt stop there: Giuliani is still a co-defendant in Georgia‚Äôs election-interference case, a matter that will require him to retain a lawyer for months at least through 2024.

He has lost everything for Trump; his money, his reputation and his family.

Giuliani is one of multiple former Trump attorneys who faced professional disciplinary proceedings for their participation in the former president‚Äôs election reversal schemes.

Another Trump‚Äôs lawyer, Sidney Powell was charged alongside Trump and 17 others with violating the state‚Äôs anti-racketeering law, entered a guilty plea just a day before jury selection was set to start in her trial.

Powell had also accused Dominion Voting Systems of flipping votes. She took her false accusation to Fox News who gave her a platform to spread those lies.

Prosecutors have accused Powell of being among a group of Trump officials and supporters who breached the elections system in rural Coffee County, Georgia, in January 2021. They were trying to persuade officials and voters that the election had somehow been rigged against Trump.

Dominion sued Powell for defamation, seeking $1.3 billion dollars in restitution.

When Dominion called Powell out under oath it was her time to shine.

Powell had the entire world as her audience ready to hear her ‚Äúexpose‚Äù how this theft of votes took place.

Under deposition by Dominion attorneys Powell cried like a baby. Her defense? ‚ÄúOnly a fool would have believed me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly a fool?‚Äù 
Who was she referring to?  Foxnews viewers?  MAGAs?  You?

Powell‚Äôs accomplice, (another Trump lawyer) Jenna Ellis also cried like a baby and publicly apologized.  
Ellis flipped on Trump too and acknowledged her criminality in pushing Trump‚Äôs lies.

Ellis‚Äô agreement to testify against Trump is a huge win for prosecutors in the sweeping case. 

Trump has since abandoned his attorneys, leaving them to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives. 

Now he‚Äôs doing the same thing to his MAGA base. 

Trump is deliberately scaring the hell out of his base. It‚Äôs very cruel but he doesn‚Äôt care. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt win on November 5th, I think our country is going to cease to exist.‚Äù

Fear mongering works on his base and he knows it.  
His cult members are easily manipulated and don‚Äôt have the critical thinking skills to defend themselves. 

Trump is literally pimping pain and fear on his MAGA cult members. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at the brink of World War III, just in case anybody doesn‚Äôt know it.‚Äù

These poor people are suffering and most of them don‚Äôt even realize it. 
Should we think of MAGAs as Stockholm Syndrome victims?

Cult members‚Äô belief in Trump is so strong that warnings from other Republicans cannot penetrate their unshakable love for their cult leader.

Even a longtime respected Republican like John Kelly could not save Trump victims with his warnings.

John Kelly, the longest-serving White House chief of staff for Donald Trump, offered his harshest criticism yet of the former president:

‚ÄúA person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about. 
A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. 
‚ÄúThere is nothing more that can be said,‚Äù Kelly concluded. ‚ÄúGod help us.‚Äù

Tragically this week another sad warning comes from yet another Trump victim.  

Caroline Giuliani the daughter of Rudy Giuliani gave this impassioned warning to members of the Trump cult:

‚ÄúTake it from me, Trump destroys everything he touches. I saw it happen to my family. Don't let it happen to yours, or to our country. 
Kamala Harris will guide us into a brighter future, but only if we unite behind her.‚Äù

Americans unite! Help rescue Trump‚Äôs victims from the sad consequences of becoming MAGA cult members.

I know because of couchsurfing and platforms like that, some are okay with it, and they're fully strangers at that point. I have a guy friend who I met online, but never met him in person. I don't even talk to him online that frequently, so I wouldn't say we were very close. I visited his city a couple summers ago, I stayed for a month, he knew, yet he told me he didn't have time to meet me. Not even just for an hour for tea/coffee. Fine, I thought. I didn't visit for his sake, I was there to experience the place. 
But now he is planning to travel in Europe (where I'm located) and has been saying how he'd like to meet me and how accommodation here is so expensive, aka hinting he would like to stay over. Am I overreacting for being slightly offended/annoyed? I'm thinking about how I was in his city for a MONTH and he wasn't bothered. Now he needs a place to crash, so all of a sudden he'd love to meet me. Why would I open my home to a stranger, even more so when there was an opportunity to get to know each other face to face but he didn't want to? I left him on read. 

I had a situation like this years ago, where I went for coffee with someone who came from a nearby city. He started saying how he needs a place to crash and I pointed him to the nearest accommodation and he seemed put off. I later told a girlfriend about this and she started saying how I should have offered my place and how I was selfish and inconsiderate, and how I didn't care about people sleeping on the streets or some shit. 

I don't understand. Even if they were online friends whom I've been following/messaging here and there for a while, I'd not be comfortable accommodating them. I might be okay with it if they were women. Is this unreasonable, do I need to chill? I personally don't think so. ",1,1728806796.0,AskWomenOver30,0,0.99,False

1g2kn9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1g2kn9i/i_feel_that_my_partner_doesnt_put_in_enough/,I [feel that my partner doesn‚Äôt put in enough effort/ isn‚Äôt responsible enough. How do I salvage the relationship?,"Me 28(F) and my bf 30(M) have been together a little more than a year. He hasn‚Äôt been in a serious relationship before and even though I can see that he cares about me/ listens to me, he does not put in the effort to reciprocate the things I do for him.
 
  A little background:
Even though we don‚Äôt officially live together, he‚Äôs always at my place, he sleeps here and we eat together most of the time. He goes back to his apartment only to change his clothes or sometimes to chill for an hour or two. That apartment is his parents‚Äô who live at the same building as him, so there‚Äôs no rent on his side. He also pays a cleaning lady for it, once a week.
  Meanwhile, I‚Äôm unemployed the last couple of months ( I quit my job to start my own business), I live 800km away from my parents/hometown, I pay rent and basically have no people here to turn to.

So to keep things as short as possible, here are some examples of things that he doesn‚Äôt do that I get to do every single day, and that have wore me down mentally:

- He doesn‚Äôt go to the store to buy stuff we both use/drink/eat (I have to go to the supermarket 2 or 3 times a week to get stuff for 2 people)
- He doesn‚Äôt cook 
- He doesn‚Äôt help me clean up the house (pick up the trash, wash dishes etc)
- He didn‚Äôt clean up after himself until I told him to
- He doesn‚Äôt  bring me coffee in the morning ( I do, every day) 
- He has never contributed financially for the house (Okay, that one is debatable, we don‚Äôt officially ‚Äúlive together‚Äù and why would he move in with me? He has minimum costs at his parents‚Äô place).

Those are only some glaring examples of his lack of effort in the ‚ÄúActs of service‚Äù department. The language I crave the most. There are way more, but less striking. 

And it‚Äôs not that much about the money for example or having a meal to eat, it‚Äôs about caring enough for the other person to bring them a f coffee from time to time. It‚Äôs the act, it‚Äôs reciprocating what the other person does for you on a daily basis. 

Taking the load off of someone once in a while and being a responsible, equal partner.

 He‚Äôs a good guy, I mean his soul is good and I do love him, so I tried many times to explain that I need him to step up and behave more like a partner, I tried to be crystal clear and specific of what is it I need and what it is  that hurts me. There were tiny changes but far from enough. I gave him space to think and told him I couldn‚Äôt be with him if he doesn‚Äôt step up. Nothing considerable happened. 

Then I started expressing my anger toward him,  being offensive. Now he‚Äôs hurt and I‚Äôm exhausted. We are at the verge of breaking up. 

Is there anything more I can do? Ideally I would love to salvage this relationship, I really want to be with that man. Thank you.

TL;DR: I feel like my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt do enough acts of service and now we are at the verge of breaking up. How do I prevent it?",2,1728805951.0,TwoXChromosomes,7,1.0,False

Since the pandemic, I‚Äôve gone back to school, switched careers, gotten sober, and really turned things around. Over the past decade, I‚Äôve dated here and there, but nothing serious. Most of the guys I was interested in seemed emotionally unavailable, or they‚Äôd flake out. Dating hasn‚Äôt been the best experience, so I decided to focus more on myself as of lately.

I recently decided to check Grindr (even though I had taken a break from apps) while I was out of town for work. I ended up connecting with a guy who caught my attention because we have similar tastes in music. We chatted for a bit and decided to meet for coffee the next morning. The conversation was effortless, and we hit it off right away. In fact, he rearranged his plans so we could hang out a bit longer before we both had to head out.

I was upfront with him and said that I really enjoyed his company and would like to see him again. He took my number, and since then, we‚Äôve been texting regularly‚Äîmost days, actually. Our conversations are really fun and pleasant, but not overly flirty. He never mentions my looks, and we don‚Äôt talk about anything sexual or too flirty, which I find refreshing. Still, we text about a wide range of topics, and he asks me a lot of questions, showing genuine interest.

He‚Äôs bought a train ticket to come visit me in two weeks, and he‚Äôll be staying at my studio apartment. (For the record our cities are only 3 hours apart.) We don‚Äôt have any firm plans, but I imagine we‚Äôll spend the weekend exploring the city, trying new food, and maybe watching movies at night.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm feeling a little uncertain: this guy seems to check every box for me, and part of me wants to just play it cool, have fun, and see where things go. But another part of me wonders if I should ask him whether he sees this weekend as something romantic. And if I bring that up -- when is a good time to do so? I dont want to ruin the weekend by bring it up too early if that's not his MO. I‚Äôve gotten more comfortable expressing my feelings lately, but this is still new for me, and I don‚Äôt want to scare him off.  I generally am a direct person, communicative but I struggle with vulnerability -- and after all these really bad dates, I feel even more confused. 

He mentioned he‚Äôs recently single and only meets a couple of guys a year when he's single, so it feels like we met by chance. His Grindr profile says he‚Äôs looking for dates or friends, but I don‚Äôt remember how long he‚Äôs been single. I dont know if that matters but I think my take from that is that he's looking for genuine connection instead of random hook-ups -- which is good because I'm in the same boat.

So, how should I approach this? Should I keep things casual and let it unfold naturally, or be upfront about how I‚Äôm feeling?",2,1728805634.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

I have this bestie(M27) na madalas kong nakakasama. this one is my close friend from college (batch mates - same major).

Si bestie ay nag out sa amin nung college na mas naaattract sya sa guys kesa sa girls pero he's not cross-dresser and not acting gay outside. I mean lalaki sya manamit at magsalita pero alam namin na gay sya and napatunayan naman since may jowa syang guy after college. Ngayon, napapadalas pagsama namin sa mga out of town, overnight sa friends house, overnight sa house nila (apartment sharing na kakilala ko rin nakatira), yaya/work sa coffee shop, midnight food hunting. Never naman kami lumabas na dalawa lang kami kasi nagcacancel ako pag ganon. Pero kapag nagpipicture kami, lagi nya sinasabi na pagkakamalan nanaman akong jowa mo nyan (tatlo kami sa pic). Tapos kung hindi ganyan sinasabi nyang pabiro, what if tayo nalang bessy (ginagatungan ng iba naming friends) lagi ko nalang banat sa kanya na 'huy hindi tayo talo!‚Äô then sinasabi ko na 'pareho tayo ng gusto t_t_ HAHAHAHAHAHA' tapos sasabihin naman nya both naman daw sa kanya. Tapos mandidiri na ako nyan and papachange topic.ü§¢

And ang pinaka recent, meron kasi sila out of town pero sa province niya. Kasama nya mga other friends nya na kakilala ko din. Sabi ko sama ako kung maganda yung lugar na pupuntahan nila. Tapos sabi nya pwede naman daw pero dadaan daw kasi sa kanila then sabi ko okay lang naman. Tapos bumanat sya na 'nako bessy baka pag nakita ka nila mama doon, sabihin na baka pwedeng ikaw na lang magdala ng apo nila' sabay tawa. Tinawanan ko sya pero deep inside sobrang awkward ko sa sinabi nya.

Ayokong magpakadelulu na isipin na may gusto sya sakin pero mga ganyang banat kasi mej halata. Ayoko naman maging distant sa kanya dahil alam kong gay sya at alam ko din sa sarili ko na di ako papatol sa kanya.

I moved out of my last accommodation and in with my current housemate in a moments desperate need. 

He helped me by letting me move into his spare room. What I didn‚Äôt know at the time was he had just been let go from his work due to multiple counts of harassment. 

It took him 7-8 months to get another job. So whilst he did me a favour, I also did him one by halving his rent. 

Whilst he was dating he was easier to live with, out having a lot of fun and always cleaning the house when there might have been the chance of bringing a female home (he dated a lot). He then got into a fairly bland relationship and during this time did not bother to clean anything, I think he expected I would do it (I can‚Äôt stand a filthy house so on my WFH days I would always give it a good once over - and then some usually). 

He had been pretty hard to live with. Depressed, on his computer 24/7, unemployed. Not helping around the house. Helping himself to my condiments/eating my food, coffee, soap, alcohol and whatever else. He also is extremely avoidant so me trying to bring any of this up with him eventuates in him pouting and ignoring me so I don‚Äôt try to communicate about touchy things (like cleaning) anymore. He has really good savings so being able to pay the rent was never an issue. 

In this time I met my current partner, he is moving to be with me in the next couple of months. My current housemate is a mutual friend of my partners and initially me and my partner agreed staying together the 3 of us might make his transition to a new city a bit easier. 

Since then, my housemates gf dumped him (warranted) and he lost the job he has had for the last 2 months over‚Ä¶‚Ä¶more workplace harassment claims. 

I don‚Äôt want to be a dick and say cya to my current housemate and leave him in a precarious living situation, but my work mates think by taking him with us we‚Äôd just be enabling him to not find a job and sort his life out. 

Me and my partner are pretty driven to lead a good life, both working good jobs and making good money, and I‚Äôm starting to feel my housemates depressed, unemployed energy is really going to bring us down as a couple trying to build a new life together in a new city.

Sort of kasi para na kaming magjowa sa mga constant na pinaggagagawa namin. Sabi nya try to landi or talk to others pa rin and if babalik pa rin kami sa isa't-isa, edi yun na yon lol.

Okay. Madali akong kausap.

I've gone out on coffee dates and hookups with a few girls recently and okay naman sila but, you know. SYA pa rin iniisip ko in the end. One time muntik magkamali yung nasabi kong pangalan buti na lang magkatunog sila üò≠

So ngayong mainit na tanghali na dapat nagpapalamig ako, eh parang nag-init pa yata lalo ako. Kakauwi ko galing makipagbonding sa mga HS classmates ko, and masaya naman kaso ayon nainggit ako may mga jowa sila. Meron sila maka-NSFW agad pag feel nila. Eh ako di pa sure üòÜ 

So eto after ko magshower kanina pag-uwi, naisipan kong makipag-usap sa kabilang subreddit na mostly pang-straight. Naghanap ako ng M4F posts kasi bi naman ako. Sabi ko, tagal ko nang di nakikipaglandian sa lalaki ah, nakakamiss. So I talked to different guys na nagpost. At umpisa pa lang wala nang takbo mga usapan namin. Iba-iba pang lalaki to ha na I was having casual conversations with. Pag babae kausap ko sa dating apps, ang gaan-gaan ng energy or kahit in the end kupal, may takbo naman pag-uusap namin kahit papano. Pero parang nararamdaman ko na may gusto na akong mangyari as the conversations went on. Pero wala pa rin kaming connection. Iniisip ko ako na ata problema dito kasi parang gusto ko na lang matapos tong exploration phase ko at masabi ko ngang sya pa rin hanap ko yieee üòÇ

Dry conversations talaga kahit lagi ako nag-iinitiate ng topic, minsan one-word replies lang nakukuha ko kahit sila ang nagpost/naghahanap. So lumipat ako sa Omegle na bago (yes po meron na haha). And decided to do a videocall (sorry na horny na rin ako eh). Yung iba usap muna, tapos naglalandian na. Nahohorny naman ako pero nangyayari eh nauuna sila matapos hahaha. Sexting and silent video call lang. Tapos nabore ako so on to the next guy. Tapos eto na, may pa-boses na para daw ma-confirm na babae ako. Naka all-black yung screen nya, yung akin is tinakpan ko muna rin. Sabi ko ""Hi? Hello?"" Kasi walang sumasagot. ""Is someone here?"". Tapos may kumakaluskos na sound na on the other end. ""HIIIII""

POTAAAHHHH naturn off ako sa boses ng lalaki HAHAHAHAHAHA. Lumambot yung imaginary dick ko pre. Nawala na rin libog ko. Kahit sinong babae siguro yung mag-hi, mahuhumaling pa rin ako. Pero eto, first time ko makarinig uli ng boses ng lalaki na ka-something ko sana, ewan ba parang napaisip ako sa lugar ko sa mundong ito. Ayun, inexit ko na ang site, put my clothes back on, and stared at the ceiling. Iniisip ko if tama pa ba ang label na ""bisexual"" sa akin kung ganito nagiging reaction ko hahaha.

We have a few apps that we speak with people on to gauge how friendly they are before meeting up for a coffee before a further meet for things I won't mention. This is mainly for our safety/security and to ensure we all get along. I mention my autism in our bio and request that people respect that my replies are slower etc.


I had been speaking with an individual for a week online and they did not communicate clearly enough with me to be able to understand what they wanted. It took me up until this point to be able to set a boundary and ask them to be more clear. To which I got the response ""autistic isn't so bad, it's not like down syndrome or something"". I've always struggled to set boundaries in my life and often find it difficult to lead conversations, therefore if the other individual doesn't put effort in to know me then they will get the same surface level questions back.

I've heard some horrible things in my life but this tops it. How can someone be so ignorant and have such little knowledge on this? Not only does it feel invalidating to me as an autistic individual but also just simply offensive for those with down syndrome (as they have no correlation or potential for comparison at all). Down syndrome is regarding chromosomes /DNA and autism is neurological. They are essentially saying that is ""worse"" and nor at any moment had I mentioned having ASD was a bad thing. It has really disturbed me.

My partner marked this down as incel behavior (excuse the language) but I can't help but think about how there must be more individuals with this closed off mentality.

So far I think it does a decent job; however, I don‚Äôt think it beats my good V60 and Pulsar brews just yet. However it for sure is more consistent. 

I‚Äôm just wondering, do you make your custom Aiden brew profiles very similar to your pour-over recipes?

For example, I normally use something simple similar  to Scott Rao‚Äôs V60 recipe. Med fine grind(c40 20clicks) 93-97¬∞C 1:17 3x bloom for 45s, 2 pours  after (wait until water drops about halfway).

I‚Äôm normally a light roast drinker (Sey, Prodigal & Flowerchild, etc.).

So I‚Äôm thinking something very similar for the Aiden. Same bloom. Same ratio and grind size. Same temp but maybe drop temp by 2-3c for the last pulse to avoid over extraction. 2 pulses with around 20-30s in between. I normally don‚Äôt let the stream break up completely between the 2 pulses so pulse time is kind of short. I think I have seen some online recipes to have 40s pulse time and I think that would drain the bed completely? 

What‚Äôs your normal approach to dialing in a coffee on the Aiden? Also what are the first things you would change depends on processing (anaerobic & natural, etc.)?

But you need to take it to the extreme. the guy who cut you off in traffic, the woman who messed up your coffee order, the guy who ignored you on the subway. especially depending on the size of your town, becoming someone who is always nice has completely changed my life. Form a connection with everyone. Everyone you have ever met is a human being, and is so deep.

I go to my favorite bar, and all of the servers know me. I don't even have to order a beer, they bring it to me with a cup of limes and greet me by name. I've met coworkers there who are astounded at the amount of staff that know me because I tip well, and not even above my means.

I had a conversation with a customer at my fast food job, and they told me they were doing a garage sale and when they said where it was I told them I would stop by. When I stopped by they recognized me and were so happy to see me they gave me a sick Harley jacket for free. (it was like $6 anyways but still free is free)

When I go to the gas station by my house, no matter the time, the person at the register will recognize me and wave hello. I am living what seems like a Disney Movie, and I didn't even try to do this.

I have friends all over the political, race, gender, sexuality, religious spectrums. I know someone from every walk of life.

I have clinical depression. I have been diagnosed by multiple psychiatrists, I have taken every single test in the book. It is nearly impossible for my brain to fall into those pits ever again, because I can't go a full day without someone being verbally happy to see me. I'm like a celebrity to the people you probably walk by every day. all because I'm nice.

I've always believed that people waste their entire lives being rude, being apathetic, doing whatever they NEED to to get by and not going above and beyond to do something that will literally never benefit them. Be too kind. Let the BMW driver cut in front of you on the commute to work. who cares? you're gonna get to work 10 seconds later at MOST. Leave the house to go to work 10 minutes earlier, grab some donuts for that coworker who constantly rats on you to your boss. why not? Hell, maybe the waitress who ignored your table has had a bad day, tip her an extra $5 and skip the energy drink tomorrow.

It‚Äôs a tragic but familiar scenario. Trump has wrecked the lives of his attorneys leaving them broken emotionally and financially.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has been disbarred. He is begging the courts for bankruptcy in order not to sell off his home and belongings for lawsuits brought against him. 
Two Georgia election workers obtained a $148 million defamation judgment against him for false allegations he made about them after the 2020 election.

It‚Äôs unlikely that Giuliani will be able to pay anywhere close to what he owes. In addition to the defamation sum, Giuliani is also on the hook for several additional outstanding debts. He is currently being sued by one of his former lawyers, Robert Costello, for lack of payment. 
In October, it was reported that the IRS had placed a lien on his Palm Beach condo. 
And the problems don‚Äôt stop there: Giuliani is still a co-defendant in Georgia‚Äôs election-interference case, a matter that will require him to retain a lawyer for months at least through 2024.

He has lost everything for Trump; his money, his reputation and his family.

Giuliani is one of multiple former Trump attorneys who faced professional disciplinary proceedings for their participation in the former president‚Äôs election reversal schemes.

Another Trump‚Äôs lawyer, Sidney Powell was charged alongside Trump and 17 others with violating the state‚Äôs anti-racketeering law, entered a guilty plea just a day before jury selection was set to start in her trial.

Powell had also accused Dominion Voting Systems of flipping votes. She took her false accusation to Fox News who gave her a platform to spread those lies.

Prosecutors have accused Powell of being among a group of Trump officials and supporters who breached the elections system in rural Coffee County, Georgia, in January 2021. They were trying to persuade officials and voters that the election had somehow been rigged against Trump.

Dominion sued Powell for defamation, seeking $1.3 billion dollars in restitution.

When Dominion called Powell out under oath it was her time to shine.

Powell had the entire world as her audience ready to hear her ‚Äúexpose‚Äù how this theft of votes took place.

Under deposition by Dominion attorneys Powell cried like a baby. Her defense? ‚ÄúOnly a fool would have believed me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly a fool?‚Äù 
Who was she referring to?  Foxnews viewers?  MAGAs?  You?

Powell‚Äôs accomplice, (another Trump lawyer) Jenna Ellis also cried like a baby and publicly apologized.  
Ellis flipped on Trump too and acknowledged her criminality in pushing Trump‚Äôs lies.

Ellis‚Äô agreement to testify against Trump is a huge win for prosecutors in the sweeping case. 

Trump has since abandoned his attorneys, leaving them to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives. 

Now he‚Äôs doing the same thing to his MAGA base. 

Trump is deliberately scaring the hell out of his base. It‚Äôs very cruel but he doesn‚Äôt care. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt win on November 5th, I think our country is going to cease to exist.‚Äù

Fear mongering works on his base and he knows it.  
His cult members are easily manipulated and don‚Äôt have the critical thinking skills to defend themselves. 

Trump is literally pimping pain and fear on his MAGA cult members. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at the brink of World War III, just in case anybody doesn‚Äôt know it.‚Äù

These poor people are suffering and most of them don‚Äôt even realize it. 
Should we think of MAGAs as Stockholm Syndrome victims?

Cult members‚Äô belief in Trump is so strong that warnings from other Republicans cannot penetrate their unshakable love for their cult leader.

Even a longtime respected Republican like John Kelly could not save Trump victims with his warnings.

John Kelly, the longest-serving White House chief of staff for Donald Trump, offered his harshest criticism yet of the former president:

‚ÄúA person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about. 
A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. 
‚ÄúThere is nothing more that can be said,‚Äù Kelly concluded. ‚ÄúGod help us.‚Äù

Tragically this week another sad warning comes from yet another Trump victim.  

Caroline Giuliani the daughter of Rudy Giuliani gave this impassioned warning to members of the Trump cult:

‚ÄúTake it from me, Trump destroys everything he touches. I saw it happen to my family. Don't let it happen to yours, or to our country. 
Kamala Harris will guide us into a brighter future, but only if we unite behind her.‚Äù

1g2jhs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1g2jhs3/haus_of_gloi_review/,Haus of Gloi review ,"I became interested in indie scents and perfume houses a few months ago and I recently purchased a few sample vials from Haus of Gloi. 
My scent preferences vary greatly and heavily depend on the time of year. I like florals in the springs but spicy gourmands in the fall and winter.
I pretty much only ordered gourmands from the Haus of Gloi. 
First and foremost, I want to say that I am honestly disappointed. This was my first indie perfume house purchasing experience and I was definitely overestimating how great my purchase would be and was definitely humbled. All of the oils had a weird oxidized base scent that just threw me off entirely. I don‚Äôt know if there was something wrong with the base being used but it smelled roughly of old castor oil and play doh. 
Beyond this, I will try to provide a note based review for each of the scents I received on a scale of 1-5.

1- ü©µ

2-ü©µü©µ

3-ü©µü©µü©µ

4-ü©µü©µü©µü©µ

5-ü©µü©µü©µü©µü©µ

Let‚Äôs begin!

Pistacia Vera: ‚ÄúPistachios and more pistachios! Dry roasted, lightly salted pistachios and sweet pistachio cream.‚Äù 

Personal rating: As soon as I opened the vial I was hit with a soft nutty pistachio. It smells sort of like tonka bean mixed with pistachio, a very soft pistachio scent. I rate this one a 4/5ü©µü©µü©µü©µ

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Sweet on you: Sweet and fruity Ruby Chocolate accord: pink berries, white chocolate and vanilla. 

Personal rating: wow I have absolutely no idea what this is supposed to smell like. I am not getting the chocolate, berries, or vanilla from this. I just smelled rancid oil and a tangy note that resembles yogurt somewhere in the distance. I tossed this one out. I rate this one 0/5

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Bourbon espresso martini: Fresh espresso, coffee liqueur and a shot of bourbon. 

Personal rating: I can‚Äôt complain much about this one: It smells exactly like coffee extract. It smells like you dumped a cup of coffee on yourself. I recently purchased a CO2 coffee extract from Eden botanicals and it smells exactly like this. There isn‚Äôt much depth though and I can‚Äôt detect any other notes beyond the coffee. I am an avid coffee drinker so I won‚Äôt complain, but disappointed that the other notes are missing to my nose. I rate this one 3/5 ü©µü©µü©µ

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

XOXO: Raspberry bubblegum, spun sugar and a hint of patchouli.

Personal rating: This smells cheap and just like bubble gum. Where‚Äôs the raspberry? I was so looking forward to that raspberry note! It doesn‚Äôt smell very fun as it evaporates very quickly and smells a bit plasticky as well. I did not like this one very much. I rate this one 1/5 ü©µ

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Raspberry rose soda: ‚ÄúRed raspberries and pink rose petals.‚Äù

Personal rating: This one is quite unique. I have nerve smelled anything quite like it. It smells like you stuck your nose into the opening of a freshly opened bottle of soda, just without feeling the fizz. Somehow the fizz was captured as a smell. I didn‚Äôt get any raspberry notes from this one; for some reason I can‚Äôt detect any of the fruit notes in any of these? I give this one a 4/5 ü©µü©µü©µü©µ

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Coffee Haus: ‚ÄúWe lightly scented this decadent perfume with true coffee essential oil and the barest hint of lemon..‚Äù

My personal rating: wow creamy coffee!! I like this coffee scent a lot better. It is very smooth and kind of smells like a freshly brewed latte. Again, just smells like essential oil, but this time with a creamier note. I give this one a 4/5 ü©µü©µü©µü©µ

Overall, it was fun trying all of these new scents, although sadly they were mostly one dimensional scents. I really do hope that nobody else has this issue with the oil smelling rancid in their orders and it was just a one off occurrence for me. It was quite the shame, however, Haus of Gloi definitely gets points for creative formulation. 
I hope that my reviews may be of use to someone on here; I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences as well. Cheers! ",3,1728800748.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

Whether you‚Äôve just spilled coffee, your kid decided the mattress was a great canvas for their juice painting, or your pet had a bit too much excitement during naptime‚Äîdon‚Äôt worry. Your mattress is gross, but we‚Äôve all been there. And now, it‚Äôs time to whip it back into shape without sacrificing your sanity.  
  
Before we begin, let‚Äôs set some expectations: there will be awkward bending, possibly some tears, and maybe a little existential questioning. (‚ÄúWhy did I ever think white was a good color for anything?!‚Äù) But by the end of this, your mattress will be as fresh as the day you awkwardly strapped it to the roof of your car and hoped it didn‚Äôt blow away on the highway.  
  
Ready? Buckle up for comedy and cleanliness (and probably more than nine steps, because counting is hard).  
  
**Step 1: Admit You Need Help**  
  
Acceptance is the first step towards clean. I'm assuming you‚Äôve already thrown a blanket over the mess and hoped for the best, but we both know ignorance is no longer bliss. It‚Äôs time to get REAL. You don't want that stain‚Äîor smell‚Äîto become a permanent member of your family, do you?  
So grab supplies: baking soda (nature‚Äôs magic dust), laundry detergent, white vinegar, a spray bottle (which you ditch dishes for), vacuum cleaner, clean cloths, and‚Äîthe most important tool‚Äîyour sheer will to do this.  
  
**Step 2: Strip That Bed Like It's a Gymnastics Meet**  
  
If you've somehow missed this part, I‚Äôm judging you just a little. Remove all bedding, blankets, sheets, and pillows from your mattress. Get them the heck out of there. If you've got stains or smells that made their way onto your sheets, too, go ahead and toss everything in the washer. Seriously‚Äî**no survivors.**  
  
Pro tip: If your bedroom already smells like a ""feral laundry heap,"" maybe toss some essential oils in the wash. Just sayin‚Äô.  
  
**Step 3: Vacuum Your Mattress (Yes, It‚Äôs Time For Your Vacuum‚Äôs Side Hustle)**  
  
Go grab that vacuum. This will probably be the most satisfying part of this whole process, honestly. You know those random crumbs, pet hair, and‚Äîugh‚Äîdead skin cells that have accumulated like a collection of broken dreams? We‚Äôre about to make them disappear.  
  
Run the vacuum across every inch of the mattress. Don't skip the corners or sides like you‚Äôre trying to dodge responsibilities. Those crevices are where the gross stuff lives‚Ä¶ like the scavengers of Helm's Deep. (A solid ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù reference‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre welcome.)  
  
**Step 4: Attack Stains With the Spraying Power of Zeus**  
  
A mattress stain is basically your mattress flipping you off every time you change the sheets. We can‚Äôt have that.  
  
Mix up your (non-toxic, because we‚Äôre all grown-ups here) mattress potion: 1 cup of white vinegar and 1 cup of water in a spray bottle. Spray your DIY cleaner on any stains and let it sit for about 10-15 minutes, because you need your arms to stay attached and vigorous scrubbing is not an option.  
  
While it‚Äôs soaking, give yourself a mental pep talk. You got this. You‚Äôre the BOSS of grime.  
  
**Step 5: Blot Like It‚Äôs Hot (And Definitely Don‚Äôt Rub)**  
  
Grab a clean cloth or towel, and gently... I repeat gently blot the spot where your cleaning solution is sitting. This isn‚Äôt a wrestling match: no rubbing or scrubbing, just pressing and lifting. Your goal here is to lift stains, not wage war on the fabric.  
  
Depending on what made the stain (we aren‚Äôt judging the mystery liquid), you may need to repeat this step a few times. Hang in there; you are basically a laundry ninja now.  
  
**Step 6: Liberally Sprinkle With Baking Soda (Pretend Your Mattress is a Giant Chocolate Chip Cookie)** > C R: Baking soda is basically the stuff of legend. In this case, it's going to help deodorize your mattress by absorbing all those funky smells that have been marinating over the months (or let‚Äôs be honest, years).  
  
Go ahead and raid that baking section in your kitchen like you‚Äôre making holiday cookies for your community bake sale‚Äîthe more the merrier. Sprinkle that magic pixie dust ALL over the mattress. Don't skimp.  
  
Once it looks like a bakery exploded in your room, leave it be. Let the baking soda sit for a few hours. Resist the urge to flop down on it during this time. Your mattress is in its peaceful deodorizing phase, and interrupting it is like hitting ‚Äúpause‚Äù on healing meditation. Don‚Äôt be that person.  
  
**Step 7: Vacuum Again (Also Known as: Pretending You‚Äôre an Adult)**  
  
Once the baking soda has had time to work its magic, it‚Äôs time to vacuum again. Yes, again. I didn‚Äôt say this would be easy, only worth it, like puzzling through the plot of ‚ÄúInception.‚Äù  
  
Vacuum away all the baking soda that‚Äôs been sitting on your mattress. This will effectively suck up odors and freshen things up in ways that Febreze only dreams of.  
  
If you find yourself weirdly emotional because your mattress smells like it belongs to a responsible human being, breathe it out. This is a sacred moment, and you deserve a tiny victory dance.  
  
**Step 8: Let the Mattress Breathe Like it‚Äôs at a Yoga Retreat**  
  
Now that it's clean, let the air do its part. Open windows, turn on a fan, do whatever it takes to let that mattress dry and air out completely. Not only does this guarantee that it won‚Äôt get moldy, but it‚Äôs also spoiling your mattress with an Instagram-worthy spa day. You can even sprinkle some lavender essential oil if you‚Äôre feeling fancy.  
  
This is also your secret ""me time."" Just sit and feel proud while it dries. Maybe scroll through another questionable Reddit thread in celebration.  
  
**Step 9: Put Your Life Back Together**  
  
Once your mattress is dry and fresh, it's time to make your bed. All of those freshly cleaned sheets and blankets you washed? Yeah, now‚Äôs their time to shine. Swaddle your perfectly clean mattress like it‚Äôs the most luxurious sanctuary for sleep‚Äîand congratulate yourself.  
You're a domestic hero. You‚Äôve not only mastered the art of cleaning a mattress, but you‚Äôve fought off future dust mites and weird smells. Queen/King/Monarch of the Mattress World.  
  
**FAQs: Because I Know You Have More Questions**  
  
Q: How often should I clean my mattress?  
A: I*deally, every 6 months, but we all know we‚Äôll probably only do it once a year, if that. So let's just aim for any time you remember.*  
  
Q: What if my mattress still smells funky after all this?  
A: *That‚Äôs Mother Nature telling you to repeat the baking soda process or consider adding some essential oils. If that doesn't work, it might be time to ""Marie Kondo"" that mattress and let it spark joy for someone else‚Äîpreferably at a distance.*  
  
Q: Help! My dog/kid/partner left a disaster, and this method didn‚Äôt totally work.  
A: *Try upping your vinegar powers, or if it‚Äôs really bad, a commercial enzyme cleaner (which specifically breaks down urine) might be in order. But seriously, who let the dog on the bed?*",1,1728800650.0,nectarsleep,0,1.0,False

I feel like my brain is broken, by in large most things don't bring me any joy, life feels pointless because on the grand scale it is and I got tied up focusing on ""the end"" when it's the journey. 

I feel stuck. I feel like I have learned helplessness, most things feel impossible, when I put forward an idea to my parents it's shot down like ""be careful"" and ""that's risky"" and like just support me just say yes I can do it without the other bit too. 

I'm a creature that lives in moment to moment as we all do so in this moment making my moments more comfortable is a viable goal to have. I've wasted a lot of money too and that's caused regret but that's in the past and the past is like smoke gone in the wind. 

I feel like growing plants has some merit to my life, they will stand the test of time growing and even if no one knows who grew it, it's growing and contributing positively to the environment all the same. 

I like the idea of having one of each berry bush just because berrys can be expensive and it's neat. Is life finding that ""neat"" feeling you get and embrace it and enjoy it for a time?

Bed is my favorite thing just being in bed cozy and warm and not bored? It's like kid me would be so BORED being in bed. I LOVED learning and I even hated holidays some because I wasn't learning new cool things and thats been burned out of me by the school system and just I want to enjoy things like I used to but it's like I cant like my brain is damaged and incapable idk. 

So much revolves around food as things now, you don't run around and play, now it's coffees and lunches out and like food is too tied to pleasure like we're just masking our fun needs.

I‚Äôm starting an intermittent dry water fast with a 22:2 schedule. I plan to document my journey here to see if this diet plan works. My goal is to lose over 10kg, mostly from water retention, and maybe some fat loss along the way.

I‚Äôve done 3-4 day dry, or water fasts before, but this time, I‚Äôm trying 22:2 to see if I can shed the water weight before heading home for Diwali. After that, I‚Äôm planning to test out a 40-day mix of dry and water fasting.

I‚Äôll be updating my progress here regularly. Anyone up for following along? Yay or nay?

Here‚Äôs my schedule:

* **6 AM:** Wake up
* **7 AM:** Light dumbbell workout
* **9 AM:** Walk (5km total for commute to work and back)
* **7 PM:** Light dumbbell workout

**Fasting Window:** 8 PM - 10 PM  
Breaking the fast with:

1. Apple Cider Vinegar + Lemon (At the Start)
2. Triphala (Ayurvedic herb, 20-30 minutes after ACV)
3. L-Carnitine (2 tabs, right after Triphala)
4. Coffee with Cinnamon + Lion‚Äôs Mane (30 minutes after L-Carnitine)

1g2jenm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HHN/comments/1g2jenm/rip_tour_review/,RIP Tour Review ,"This was my first experience at HHN and the RIP tour. I decided to go on my birthday and we booked the time at 8:20 as it was the only time available at the time. My husband and I got early access, but we arrived at 630 because of some time conflicts. We were planning on leaving earlier, but I couldn't get out of work in time. However, once we got there it was easy to get through Valet and on to the park. The security check was short and then we went over to check in and they were super nice and said it was okay to check in early. I told them we had early access and they gave us wristbands, explained where to wait for out tour guide and what time to get back by. They told us we could use our RIP pass as an express pass and we could start the mazes if we wanted to. They asked us if there was anything we wanted to check out and my husband was looking forward to trying the marshmallow s'more (he thought it was a little cold and would have tasted better if it was slightly warmer). 

We decided to walk around the park and see how everything looked. The park was quite full especially the lot by Super Nintendo World. We spent a little time there and it was the deadest we have every seen it. It was nice to be able to walk around and enjoy the scenery without all the crowds. We got on the ride using the express lane and then headed back to wait for the tour guide around 745. It was fun walking back up because once we got to the scare zones, the scare actors were roaming. We got back to the VIP area and went upstairs. We watched from upstairs as people got scared by the chainsaw scare actors. It was fun to watch. The actors were super into their roles.  

Our tour guide came over to introduce herself and gathers us all to discuss how the tour was going to go down and safety stuff. The first stop was the VIP dinning and I was so hungry. The food was super delicious especially these lemon tarts they had. The only thing I did not like was the bathroom situation. There were only two all gender bathrooms and at first it wasn't too bad because the place was empty, but once more groups started pouring in, it was a problem. The line became so long and at one point there was this drunk girl taking forever, her friend had to call her to hurry up. 

Before I go into the houses, I should say that I scare easily and was super nervous about how the mazes were going to go. I have heard that the mazes at HHN were super scary. The only kind of mazes I had experienced before were the mazes from Magic Mountain. From what I remember they were scary and they had a lot of flashing lights. The pacing was slow. 

 All the houses were fun, but there were some that could have been better. All the houses felt super rushed. We walked through them fast. It was kind of annoying when the people would say keep moving, don‚Äôt stop. Then people would stop or slow down and they would start yelling again. I hated the curtains, especially my husband. They were so annoying and there were so many in spots that were unnecessary. Especially the heavy ones, I got clonked at least twice. Insidious had a smell but it wasn‚Äôt too bad. The smell in Texas was horrendous. My husband didn‚Äôt smell it too much, but I did. It smelled like nasty, musty feet with vomit. It wasn‚Äôt in the entire house just a couple rooms. There were also areas that could have used scare actors. It felt like there were some missing. 

The extra ‚Äúmaze‚Äù for the RIP tour was Jupiter‚Äôs Claim, but it was whatevs. Nothing special about it. I would have preferred to skip it. The trolley tram was another issue for me. We shared the bus with another group, so as were went through the mazes we had to wait for them to move on to the next one and to get on the trolley. We had enough brakes for bathroom and drinks, but we didn‚Äôt get to see the Purge show or the Chucky Show, but I wasn‚Äôt really looking forwards to them since we‚Äôre going on Nov 2nd for our complimentary ticket. Our tour was done at 1 am and we just walked around and drank a little until the ending ceremony with the chainsaws. Then we left home. 

Although there were some issues I had with the experience, I still enjoyed my time there and would do the RIP tour again, just at an earlier time. The animatronics were pretty cool, especially at the Quiet Place. There were some scenes in some houses that were gruesome. I got scared a good amount of times. Next year my birthday will fall on a Saturday and I will book ahead of time to get an earlier time. The tour guide said we could go back to the VIP dinning again too, so I wished we had more time, because I would have loved to have some more of the lemon tarts with some coffee. I wasn‚Äôt so sure of doing it this year, so that is why we got a later time.

1g2jelz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g2jelz/is_asking_for_recommendation_letters_wrong/,Is asking for recommendation letters wrong without asking my boss first.,"Hi I (22 female) work at a veterinary clinic as a veterinary assistant making 14.50h. I have worked there for almost 9 months now. Here is some back story of how it's been working there. I commute an hour there and back making my day almost 12 hours. I work 4 days out of the week and 10 hour shifts with an hour lunch. I'm expected to work past my schedule shift so there for I'm there longer. I'm also know how to work upfront and pharmacy. We are short staff but my tech lead saids we are not. Their idea of full staff is one tech per doctor mind you there's only 30 minutes per appointment even the sick ones. For an example if I bring a dog for a senior screen I need help getting blood and urine but theres no one to help and the doctor are busy with 3 other things. I feel exhausted trying to do everything. I tired asking them to change my schedule because I need be able to get home at a reasonable time. Also, I have not been getting great sleep and have come close to falling asleep behind the wheel. Yes I know it's bad and I have tried drinking coffee it but it makes it worst. They tried telling me that it's my fault for not using time wisely when I get home and that my commute is the problem. They have tried to ""Accommodate"" what I was asking but bearly made a difference. So I thought it would be a good idea to find another place to work that's closer to where I live and I'm going to be starting the penn foster vet tech program soon so it would help too. There are 6 doctor at my place of work I asked 2 of them for a recommendation letter and they ask why so I told the truth. Later that day my tech lead asked to speak with me. She told me that I wasn't allowed to ask for recommendation letter without telling her I'm thinking of leaving. She said I made her look bad because the doctors were asking her what was going on and that if I leave they will be short staffed and she had no idea and looked unprofessional/in the dark. But what had me was that she literally said right after that she could terminated me for my recent tardiness from the last pay period or somthing like that. but said she wasn't gonna do that and do the nice thing and just write me up. I am no perfect person and I admit I do run late sometime but when that is the case I always let them know. I usually am only 3 to 5 minutes late but most of the time it's the traffic that makes me late I always try to leave 30 minutes early. So my question is it's wrong for asking for a recommendation letter without tell my boss. I have alot of mixed feels about what happened any advice would be great and sorry for the lack of grammar it's not my strong suit. 
Thank you.

My daughter recently turned 2 and I decided I was ready to fully wean her. We‚Äôve had an amazing breastfeeding experience and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm really proud of. It wasn‚Äôt the easiest at times as she refused a bottle and had a dairy allergy so I‚Äôve also had to be dairy free for the last 18 months. I‚Äôve loved being able to breastfeed her and ‚Äòmilky cuddles‚Äô have always been one of her favourite things, so I was dreading weaning as I knew she didn‚Äôt want it. I managed to get her down to morning and night feeds only, then I stopped offering and only fed her if she asked. We recently switched to my husband doing bedtime and letting her watch some morning cartoons to distract her during the times she would usually be having milk, but on Monday I realised it‚Äôd been three days with no milk. I decided we‚Äôd power through and we talked a lot about how she can drink milk from a cup now and she‚Äôs a big girl etc. She did keep asking occasionally and there were a few tears, but she‚Äôs old enough that we could talk about it and now we‚Äôre over a week milk free! 

I hadn‚Äôt intended the last feed to be the last feed at the time, but when I looked back at the last feed on the Friday morning I realised how perfect it was. She‚Äôd woken up ridiculous early at 4.30, so I brought her in to bed for some ‚Äòmilky cuddles‚Äô and she fell asleep while she was feeding. I didn‚Äôt have to count down or anything to stop her feeding (she never wanted to let go!), she got to experience her favourite way to fall asleep for the last time and I got that one last milk drink sleepy little girl üòçüò≠ I‚Äôm still a little bit sad that it‚Äôs the end, but I‚Äôm ready to buy some new bras and exited to eat cheese and drink some Christmas coffee‚Äôs with real milk üòÇ
