I just started helping organize our go club (for those unfamiliar & curious, [https://www.usgo.org/](https://www.usgo.org/) ) here in San Antonio. We are looking to add a second meeting day, and I was hoping to get some cool ideas for venues.

We currently meet on Thursday nights at Black Potion (blue dot in map below), but I have been seeing feedback that this is not the most convenient location, time, or not an ideal venue from some people. We are still keeping our Thursday nights, but we would like to have a second meeting on Sunday afternoons. I am thinking a venue in the blue box below would be most ideal, because it allows for people out in Helotes, Boerne, and NE San Antonio to hopefully attend the meetings, as well as most people who are more central and are already attending our Thursday meetings.

I'm open to any and all suggestions on venues, and we will probably rotate between a few on Sundays until we find one that we'll settle in at. Some ideas I had for types of venues so far have been coffee shops, libraries, community centers, or other game stores. I think it would be nice (but not required) if the venue is a bit quieter, so we could do certain things like lectures etc. I also think it would be nice if the venue was a bit more family friendly. I should also note that the venues should be free. Looking forward to your ideas!",1,1751645446.0,sanantonio,0,1.0,False

1lrmiag,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleControlFreak/comments/1lrmiag/moka_express_cf_precision/,Moka Express CF Precision,"Long time listener, first time caller.

I have a Breville Control Freak Commercial. 

I've been trying to perfect stovetop espresso with it, but not having much luck.

My bialetti is aluminum, so I bought the induction plate to go between it and my Freak.

I put just the water chamber on there, and bring it to a boil. Then I put the grounds basket in and attach the top chamber. (Many recipes suggest starting with boiling water. More ideally, I would hope to not have to, as this multi step process is a bit of a pain. Just put room temperature water in, assemble the while thing, and let precision CF do its magic!)

The ideal brew starts in 30 seconds and lasts no more than 4 minutes. 

Too hot/fast and you get sputtering instantly. Which leads to a bitter cup. 

Too low and slow will over extract, leading to a sour cup. 

I've tried the high intensity setting, which leads to over shooting the temperature set point, but middle intensity is too slow. 

I use a temperature set point of 212F, but it honestly gets too hot over the whole brew.

So, I 'surf' my moka pot. I watch the brew, and if it's slow or fast or sputtering, I remove it from heat or put it back on the induction plate accordingly. 

Disappointingly, I've continued to have a very manual process even with the CF's level of precision.

Looking for guidance on coffee making on the Control Freak. Tthis is one recipe I haven't been able to crack yet. 

Or maybe more broadly, some guidance on refining recipes.

vernon nielsen aka the guerrilla mystic



because if thats turned on citizens there will be no America.

all the way back to when you were in school and if you were a stuck up pig, nothing will be unknown. social credit scores for all who seek government employment/elected office

getting downloads on the bbb AI aspect and its humorous, nothing will be unknown about anyone seeking government employment/ elected office, they wont be able to have a fake face

i mean i was shown this particular year five years ago but that doesnt mean the weather isnt manipulated +++ discipline, darkness belongs as a shadow not as an internal work

this time im like nope but you can take the shadow around me back to whoever is causing the odd rain as of late

example of keeping inner darkness out, many things have contributed to my inability to fix my roof, from the eye surgery last year to money constriction that were just odd af. i would typically get up set about this. ive spent a couple grand on that noise

as a social credit score of future candidates though. the whole Trump AI thing with a ten year state moratorium looks pretty sinister, but im also seeing it could be used to 'socially credit score any one making it into a public office, using it on the public will back fire and break America, i think Trump knows that

mans biggest flaw is they think they know something, what is known is known through us from source, the lack of acknowledging that is the root of the condensed reality of delusion everyone exists in where pointing fingers at each other is the daily bread

so i wasnt going to say but energies shifted yesterday , i dont know how long till others pick up on it but some actually did yesterday. Good stuff, these petty narratives of mankind cant keep ruling the day for much longer, its all just brain drugs addiction.

same is true of friendships although the true form of it as carrying each others burdens/aiding each other in success friendships are nearly dead

really you should have no bonds if its not equal to your own spiritually and energetically and you should be aware of the things youd need to change to accommodate such a thing, which most are not. cuz thats normal. at the end of the day its all about the purity of energy

youre creating a psychic bond as you describe it linking you to that person and all their manias, their subconscious, every thought and emotional process. so youre compounding your own difficulties

youre creating a psychic bond as you describe it linking you to that person and all their manias, their subconscious, every thought and emotional process. so youre compounding your own difficulties

lets take unmarried/undedicated sex for example, there is no better way to energetically twist yourself up than that on a normal level. youre binding energies, exchanging darknesses, dulling the senses to the point of guttural animalism, no pure flow going in that +++

Most people are subtly influenced so they cannot perceive it and the information designers of this world blindsided people with the normalization of a lot of smaller dark things that seemed innocuous but in reality were a trap, so now you have a saturated world of unwholesomeness

early Christians probably had the scriptures that instructed them on how to discern the influence of darkness in them and keep it outside of influencing them, early rabbis not knowing anything probably encountered a compounded darkness come against them by messing with them

its all energy exchange/ bartering you purchase the energy you receive with the energy you give.

the realized whove set there darkness outside of them and there are few, typically would give warning about messing with others at all but there are energetic offsets. even things like condemning others will offset the condemneds wrongful actions energetically

realized darkness is either embraced or set outside, msot people arent realized so they meddle with light and dark as per the instructions and examples set by the media and those around them, its rather robotic

,,, also borrowing strength from the darkness around you.

i wish you could see what im being shown, if your darkness is not in you it is around you it will never depart you and those who offend you will cause the darkness in the offender to attack the offender.

and i will illuminate these things,,,, after i make coffee. AM visions

i clearly understand what the rabbis feared of the early christians mysterious power.

but in the AM inspired considerations, get some proof on your person by messing with me, id just suggest you tread lightly. this has been with me since childhood, its just grown into a very powerful thing. ive always noticed people getting it back from messing with me

14 years ago id have called that insane and delusional but ive watched person after person try me and have bad things happen, it doesnt matter who they are or how good they think they are, how much money or anything like that, none of that rates, it amounts to nothing

im not lying, a fallen angel  was summoned to destroy me, what i went through was unimaginable and excessively difficult to describe. I survived because of God but in that this horde of entities i survived didnt depart, they remain constantly vetting me for the truth of being

interesting AM consideration, those that mess with me get to tangle with  some spiritual bs that manifests in material ways, the worst transgressors could lose people to death , which is pretty sad, they could get near death themselves.",1,1751644796.0,realspiritualawakenin,0,1.0,False

Hi there, my online name is Ponder.

I'm posting here to vent/cry/release this whelming unseen feeling as a man, in a world where i feel im always a threat because of my gender. Thank you for clicking on my post today, i hope something today makes you feel supported and seen.

I want to tell you a bit about my energy  as a displaying heterosexual cis man. before you scroll away, I said displaying. I was and am for the time being married to a woman, I have a beautiful child who I still try and raise with love toward this woman. His mom really is a wonderful soul. I knew her for 12 years before we got pregnant,

As a young man who came from emotional and physical abuse, seperated parents, drug addicted households, schizophrenia in atleast one household, poverty, racial abuse, body dismorphia, adhd, etc etc, I felt as though I could see her as a human that I always loved. 

I want to give perspective on the significant things that shape my ""masculine traits"" as well as my ""feminine traits"" as well. I believe that these traits exist in all of us, and they don't exclusively exist in one gender or another. 
I believe this is why I have had 4 relationships, where there was some sort of queer, or LGBT themes. I mean 2 because obviously they were men, but the other 2 women, because they went on to be in relationships with women. This new ability to communicate amongst ourselves online has given us so many safe places to be open that it's allowed for such discourse as r/postgenderism or r/guycry to exist. 

I am man because I have a penis, not because I'm motivated toward my career. Motivated toward financial safety and toward ensuring financial safety for my family. I am a man AND I am confident and strongly rooted in who I am and the structure of my family values. I am a man because I ejaculate sperm, not because I held my son against my bare chest in the first days of his life while his beautiful mother recovered from a c-section. 

I'm a man because I teach my son how to talk about his feelings when hes upset, to show love and care and empathy toward others. I'm a dad because when I climb on the playground and monkey around the same ways I would when I was young and show my son the athletic creativity a playground set can offer. I'm a man because when the angsty teenage boy working the hot food section at the grocery store made my wife feel small, I step up and make sure I correct the order because I listened to her speak. I'm a man because I stand up for others and what is right in my community, when a child or adult is visibly having a hard time in public, at the park, on the train, or at Costco. We reach out and support those people around us. I'm a man because when I see a person with a flat tire I stop. Im a man bc I see a neighbor stripped the screws on his acura doing a brake job, I hit it with my man purse! and I walk away no expectations, just a smile and a hand shake. I'm a man because when my friend needs a free/ extra cheap brake job, I got you ;). I'm not a man because I like boob jokes, and jokes about the nasty. I'm not a man because I drive a coupe and like to make my son excited when daddy's car goes noooom! Nor because I wear cologne, and men's deodorant, or shoes, or a men's watch. My ear piercings closed years ago.

I'm not a woman, but I care about my hair, clothes and the way i look outwardly in the world. I dont clear the polishing dust from my eyes on purpose. 
I like my guy liner, and im going to wear it every time im out and about on the town from now on. Im not a woman but i want my scarred hands to look nice, clean, and manicured to my preference. I want to smell nice and feel warm when i hug my loved ones.Offer them food, to do my tender love and care to restore my space to its intended warmth.  and be the best goddam host you've ever visited, even if youre not my guest. I'm not a woman because I serve you coffee/tea/water/coke zero/Pepsi max when you enter my home, after I've vacuumed, rearranged, tidied, sprayed and wiped every surface, serviced the porcelain, emptied sinks, and garbage.Im not a woman because the first thing I do when I see you is ask for love, touch and affection, because im excited to see you. 

I'm not a woman because I want to hold hands. Or because I have bunnies tattooed on my arm, or because I want roses and carnations ( and spiders) sleeved around my bunnies. Im not a woman, or gay because i find a specific type of man attractive. Nor are me and my friends gay for having the arguement of whos taking our asses between deadpool or wolverine. I'm not a woman because I care deeply about my relationships, and want to support people around me. Im not a woman but i can hear the sad in your voice when you talk about the way your spouse treats you. The way your friends dont show up for you, the way your mom hurts you when she says mean things. Im not a woman but i underatand the pressures from parents of different backgrounds, traditions, expectations and generational trauma. Misogyny AND Misandry. don't have breasts, but I wake up at any hour of the night to feed my child. I don't have a vagina, but I prefer to sit and pee when I'm feeling safe in my home.

 I didn't carry my son, I didn't get to feel that relationship grow for almost a year before meeting him, but I love him so deeply. I didn't have to experience carrying a child, or birthing one, or the trauma of everything in between. There is so much more I could have done to be supportive of his mama when she carried him.

I wasn't raised in a house that displayed healthy perfect love, but I knew what it was supposed to feel like when a home is safe. I don't know how to love another person properly, but I'll learn through loving myself, and raising my child on that love. He is so beautiful, raising a child is so wonderful, and im so blessed to experience this in my lifetime as a cis man. I will do my part to raise a healthy man by providing a safe, intentional, space for my baby. 

I'm human, and I will grow.

In saying all of this, I want others to feel comfortable expressing their masculine and feminine expressions. I like to believe this is grounding in a chaotic universe. 

I want to encourage others to be curious, and to be guilt free when expressing their interest in others' soul experience. We all have a valuable story to tell when we can be vulnerable and safe in our homes, our communities, and in the legacy we leave in peoples hearts. 

Be patient, give grace to others and yourself too! and Accept the mistakes you make, because you can grow from them.

I hope to see a world where women and men can feel safe around each other when they allow themselves to be vulnerable together. Where women aren't choosing the bear, and men aren't choosing the tree. Please pardon me nonbinary allies. maybe you can find another object in nature you'd rather communicate with than your partner sometimes. Be vulnerable with eachother and support anyone and everyone, anywhere, in any way you can. <3✌️💖🌈<3

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Valentín

The door hissed shut behind them, leaving the shelter a little quieter and a hell of a lot more human.

I was still watching the entrance when I felt it, that look.

Washburn didn’t say a word at first. Just gave me that smug, sideways grin, all teeth and trouble. His red eyebrows lifted like punctuation marks on whatever mischief was bubbling up in that half-feral brain of his.

Then he clapped his hands together.

“Well,” he said, voice rich with Southern drawl and wicked intentions, “now that the ladies are gone…”

Oh crap.

“I reckon it’s *beer time*.”

I sighed. “It’s always beer time with you.”

“Damn right.” He was already digging in a cooler stashed beneath the kitchenette counter. Where did he *get* all this stuff? “And don’t gimme that ‘responsible adult’ look. We survived bigoted parents, you got your lady, I made breakfast. That’s three accomplishments by my count. Time to celebrate.”

He popped a can with a sharp hiss and passed it to me. I took it reluctantly, feeling the cold condensation on my fingers. The label had some kind of snake hissing on it, probably some kind of ironic choice, knowing him.

“What even is this?” I asked, peering at it.

“Strong as hell, brewed in a shed in Arizona, and probably illegal in like five states.”

“Charming.”

He grinned wider. “So’s my company.”

We cracked open the beers and leaned against the counter. The hushpuppy crumbs were still scattered around, like little golden casualties of breakfast. My body was still tense from everything, but the drink helped. Just a little.

“You gonna be okay?” Wash asked after a moment, his voice softer now.

I glanced at him.

“Yeah,” I said. “I think I might.”

He raised his can. “To *might*.”

I clinked mine against his with a dull metallic *clack*.

“To might.”

Washburn didn’t say anything at first. He just leaned against the counter, took a slow sip of his drink, and stared ahead like he was watching ghosts float through the cargo bay.

Then, in a tone that lacked his usual fire, he muttered, “You ever stop to think about what this means for her?”

I turned my head, brow knitting. “What?”

He looked at me, one eye narrowed, that mischievous glint nowhere to be found. “Tyla. Her folks flipped. Bad. I mean, damn near fell into a coma from seeing you two together. That’s... more than a bump in the road, hermano. That’s a crater.”

“I know,” I said quietly.

Wash pressed. “Do you?”

I didn’t answer right away. I didn’t know how to. All I could picture was Tyla trembling in my arms last day, those brave emerald eyes swimming with heartbreak and hope. Her wool still faintly smelled like the scarf I gave her. She was mine now, and I was hers. But what that *meant* out here, back on her homeworld, was a whole lot more complicated than it was in the wilderness or on the battlefield.

“She and I,” I started slowly, “we’ve been through a lot. Crashed on an alien planet. Fought for our lives. She risked everything for me, even hunted for me. This?” I gestured vaguely toward the entrance, toward the memory of her screaming mother. “This is just another battle. One more thing we have to win. Together.”

Wash rubbed his jaw and took another swig. “Yeah, well, that kinda thinking only works in the field. Where everything’s clear: enemy or ally. Kill or don’t. But here?” He pointed a finger at me like he was jabbing my thoughts. “You can’t guard-dog your way through this, Escobar.”

I winced. “Stop calling me that.”

He waved off the protest, his voice serious now. “I mean it. If you wanna be her shield, fine. But you gotta be more than that. You gotta be soft with her. Gentle. This isn’t a warzone. Not in the same way. She doesn’t need a soldier shoutin’ orders or punchin’ problems. She needs someone who’ll hold her when the whole world’s trying to tear her apart.”

I stared down into my beer.

Washburn elbowed me lightly. “You got it in you. Just... don’t forget that the fight isn’t always what’s outside. Sometimes it’s in how you love her.”

I didn’t say anything, just nodded. I felt the weight of it settle in my chest, he was right.

She wasn’t just another mission… She was the reason I survived the others.

Washburn let the silence hang for just a moment, long enough for the weight of his advice to settle… before ruining it like only he could.

“Aaand speaking of *speep* love…” he drawled with a sly grin, twirling the half-empty can in his hand. “Did some research, hombre. I think you two are golden. Shouldn’t be a problem.”

“Wait” I said slowly, narrowing my eyes. “How do *you* know that?”

Wash’s smug expression only deepened. He leaned back, hands behind his head like he was real proud of himself. “I went Welsh, partner. Full Welsh. Kiwi even, maybe Basque too”

It took me a second to process.

And then it hit me like a brick to the skull.

“With Kaija? *Kaija* Kaija? The little cottonball?!”

He just grinned like the devil himself. “Yup. Turns out the sass wasn’t just for show.”

I stared at him, horrified. “You dog, you’re a menace, absolutely unhinged.”

“Hey, don’t knock it till you try it,” he said with a wink. “We’re in a whole new frontier, buddy. Gotta embrace the spirit of diplomacy.”

“You need to be *quarantined*,” I muttered, rubbing my temples. “There’s something *deeply* wrong with you.”

Wash’s grin twisted into something *evil*. The kind of expression that said *you done goofed*, and there was no escape.

“Oh please! Like *you’re* one to talk, Val!” He slapped the counter, eyes gleaming. “I’m guessin’ you didn’t do it last night…yet! But I’m bettin’ my *entire ass* you wanna *load Tyla’s ramp* so bad it hurts!”

“*WASH!*” I barked, nearly choking on my drink.

But it was too late. The Texan was locked in. No survivors.

“Oh no no no don’t ‘Wash’ me, you lovesick bastard!” he roared with laughter. “I *see* you! You walk around all quiet, brooding, mystery man , but underneath? *Underneath?* You’re a damn Venlil-chasin’ *degenerate*! You wanna plug that data port and boot up her operating system like it’s friggin’ mating season in the savannah!”

“*MOTHER OF GOD,* SHUT UP!” I flailed with both hands like that’d physically stop the verbal barrage.

He ignored me entirely. “I *know* that look you give her, man. Like you’re gonna whisper sweet nothings, then *boom!* full system override! Your woolly little sweetheart’s gonna be *rebooting for days!*”

I covered my face with my hands. “You’re going to hell, no trial. Just a trapdoor opening under your boots.”

Wash leaned in, smug as ever. “Say what you will, Escobar. But if *I* had a cute, badass, predator-loving Venlil girlfriend hangin’ off my arm? I’d be workin’ that tail like an union job.”

“This is why we can’t have normal conversations man!*.*”

Wash just patted my back like I hadn’t just been verbally *nuked* in ten different languages. “You’re welcome, bud!”

Tyla

The train terminal wasn’t exactly glamorous, but it was busy. Wide, arched ceilings, the hiss of air brakes, the clatter of crates being loaded and offloaded. The stale scent of transit clung to everything, and somewhere in the distance, a food stall was burning something. I couldn't believe Kaija worked in a place like this. Then again, I’d always pegged her as a creature of organized chaos.

She walked ahead with her usual sass, her gait a little more confident now that we were on her turf. I trailed behind, ears twitching as a massive Yotul ambled over from the customs booth.

“Kaija,” he drawled, giving her a once-over, “who’s the new girl?”

“Friend of mine,” she said smoothly. “Military. She’s just tagging along today. No place to stay right now, poor thing.”

His large ears flicked and he turned to me.

“Thank you for your service, ma’am. Hope things settle down for you.”

“Thanks,” I said, awkwardly shifting on my paws. He didn’t press, thankfully, and padded away toward a stack of cargo manifests.

Kaija sighed. “He’s nice, but he *always* assumes I’m bringing in new recruits.”

“You *are* the one always bossing people around.”

“Only because no one else can do their job properly,” she replied, smug.

For a while, it was smooth sailing. Kaija showed me the basic layout, how she logged incoming shipments, flagged suspicious cargo, and issued fines. She did it all with flair, like she was performing a one-Venlil show. I sat beside her, nibbling on a ration bar, enjoying the rare sense of calm.

Then came the mango incident.

“Oho, *nope*, not again,” Kaija muttered, narrowing her eyes at a familiar figure.

A tall, well-groomed male Krakotl was wheeling a crate toward the scanning booth, trying his best to look casual. *Too* casual.

“I swear on the sun’s crust,” Kaija hissed. “If this is *another* mango smuggler”

I blinked. “Is that… a common crime?”

“With *Krakotl*?” she snapped. “Yes!”

I tilted my head, suppressing a smirk. “Kaija, are you racially profiling?”

Her wool puffed up like she’d been hit by a gust of wind. “WHAT?! No! No, y-you *demon*! Don’t say that!”

“You *just* said-”

“I said it’s statistically *frequent*! That’s not profiling, that’s data!”

“Sure, sure.” I leaned back against the crate behind me. “Next thing you’ll tell me all Nevok are terrible tippers.”

“I *never* said that!” she wailed, scandalized. “You take that back!”

“Oh my stars, I’m going to file a complaint.”

“I swear to the Void, I will *end* you, Tyla.”

I couldn’t help but laugh, ears curling in delight. It felt *good* to laugh again. Even if it was at Kaija’s expense.

“Can you imagine the headlines?” I said through a giggle. “Customs officer is Secretly a Specieist.’”

Kaija made a strangled sound, flailing dramatically toward the Krakotl who was now very obviously pretending not to notice us.

“You know what? I *hope* he’s got mangoes. I hope I get to fine him so hard his beak pop off.”

“Speciesist *and* vengeful,” I mused, grinning. “You're on a roll.”

“You’re impossible,” she muttered, and I saw the twitch of her tail betray her faux outrage. “Why do I *miss* you when you’re not around?”

“Because you need someone to keep you humble.”

She chuckled. “You're doing a *terrible* job.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We found a quiet corner just outside the terminal, a little bench beneath the overhang where the dull haze of perpetual dusk softened the shadows. Kaija had snagged a small takeout box from the breakroom vendor: two loaves of warm *strayu*, soft and dusted with grain, and a generous helping of crisp, colorful salad with earthy root slices and tangy herbs.

“Best part of the job,” Kaija said, tearing her bread in half and handing a piece to me. “Technically for on-shift only, but I’m the queen of finding loopholes.”

“I’m shocked,” I said dryly, but took the bread anyway. It was soft, warm in my paws, and tasted a little like toasted grain and something sweet underneath. “What is this filling?”

“Not sure,” she said through a mouthful. “Some fruit-paste thing. Good though, right?”

I bit into it. It was good, soft, just the right hint of spice, a tiny crunch from seeds or nuts I couldn’t name. Comforting. The kind of food that lingered in your memory.

For a while we just ate in silence, the soft murmur of the station in the background. It was a peaceful kind of quiet, almost meditative, until Kaija broke it.

“So…” she began, careful, “your parents.”

I froze, paw halfway to my mouth.

“I don’t-” My voice cracked. I swallowed hard, lowered the bite. “I don’t want to talk about it.”

Kaija didn’t look away. She didn’t press either. Just flicked hear ears and leaned back against the bench with a sigh.

“You don’t need to,” she said. “I just… I wanted you to know I’m here. No matter what happened. I’ve got you, alright?”

My throat tightened, warmth rising in my chest. Different from the heat of the strayu or the hum of the food. This was deeper. Raw. Like finding shelter in a storm you hadn’t realized you were still standing in.

I set the rest of my strayu aside, pressing my paws together to steady them.

“Thanks, Kaija.”

Kaija leaned back again, propping one leg over the other, tail flicking like she was trying very hard *not* to explode.

“So…” she began slowly, a glimmer in her eye. “You and Valentín. Like, *you* you.”

“C’mon, Tyla. I'm asking if you were honest. *Really* honest. Like, words-out-loud, feelings-on-the-table kind of honest.” she added

I stared at her then exhaled slowly. “…Yeah. We were.”

Kaija turned fully toward me, her ears practically trembling. “You *said it*. Both of you?”

I flicked my ears in affirmation, cheeks heating. “Everything. We… we finally said everything.”

She squeaked…  Actually squeaked. “Oh, *speh*, Tyla! That’s *huge*!  This is, like, a whole *romance drama arc!!!* I could write a novel!”

I covered my face with both paws. “Kaija…”

“Nope, I refuse to be chill about this,” she said, practically vibrating on the bench. “And you kissed, didn’t you? Oh, don’t even try to lie, I *see* that wool fluffing up. *How was it?!*”

I groaned into my paws, but she wasn’t going to let it go. So I peeked through my claws and muttered, “It was… it was wonderful. Warm. Passionate. He just- he held me like I was something precious and-”

Kaija let out a dramatic gasp.

“and then my parents showed up and *completely ruined it,*” I added bitterly.

The sparkle in her eyes dulled just a bit, her ears folding in sympathetic pain. “Oh stars. Right. Yeah, that would kill the mood.”

“It *did*.”

A long silence followed. Kaija looked down at her strayu, tail curling tight around her leg.

“…Sorry,” she murmured. “Didn’t mean to drag that back up.”

I shook my head, reaching across the table to gently nudge her paw. “You didn’t. I mean… you kind of did. But it’s alright.”

She gave a tiny, modest laugh. Then, something flickered across her face. A sudden glimmer in her eye. A shift in posture. Her ears perked ever so slightly, and she slowly turned her head toward me.

Oh no.

“Kaija,” I warned, narrowing my eyes.

“You know…” she said, voice dropping into that *too casual* tone that always meant trouble. “I was doing a little research. For your sake.”

“Research,” I repeated, instantly suspicious. “What kind of research?”

Her ears twitched with mischievous delight. I could practically *see* the demon curling up in her pupils. This was the face of a predator in its natural habitat.

Kaija leaned closer across the table, casting a glance left and right like she was about to share classified military intelligence.

“It fits” she said, deadpan.

My brain stalled. “What? What *fits*, Kaija?”

She just smiled. A human-like snarl, a *knowing* little smile. The kind only a Venlil who had absolutely no shame and had clearly seen something she could never unsee.

“*KAIJA!*” I sputtered, nearly choking on a mouthful of strayu.

She was already laughing, the smug little speh. But something in my brain finally clicked.

Wait.

Wait, wait, wait *no*.

My eyes widened as the full, terrible truth crashed over me like a falling cargo crate.

That limp. Her weirdly ruffled fur. The way she kept shifting in her seat and avoiding questions back at the shelter. Her absolutely *feral* look every time Washburn opened his mouth.

“You didn’t…” My voice went hoarse. “You *did*.”

Kaija blinked innocently. “Did what?”

“Don’t play dumb with me! You mated with Washburn!” I hissed, pointing an accusatory claw at her across the table. “*That’s* why you were walking like someone had replaced your bones with noodles! That’s why your wool looked like a dust storm had eaten it alive!”

Kaija nearly fell off her chair, cackling. “Oh *Speh*, you should see your face right now! You look like you just walked in on your parents doing it!”

“I’M GOING TO BE SICK!”

“No you’re not,” she wheezed, wiping a tear from her eye. “You’re just finally realizing that your girl here’s got game.”

“With *Washburn?!*” I screeched. “That big, loud, chaotic meat slab?! He drinks motor oil and calls it coffee!”

Kaija leaned back in her chair, grinning like a predator herself. “He’s *fun*, Tyla. You should try not judging a strayu by its crust.”

“I- *fun*?!” My voice cracked. “What part of *Washburn* screams ‘fun’ to you?! The volume? The bizarre nicknames? The way he stomps around like a drunken Mazic?!”

She tilted her head. “Did you know his real name is *Hunter*?”

I blinked. “...What.”

Kaija gave a theatrical little shiver, practically purring. “Mmhmm. *Hunter Washburn*. Oooh, so *predatory*, don’t you think?”

“Kaija.” My voice was a whisper now. “You’re insane.”

She leaned forward, eyes sparkling. “You’re just mad I got there first. But don’t worry I’ve done the research for you!.”

I opened my mouth, unsure if I was going to yell or cry.

Then she said it.

“Oh and by the way? That whole thing about human *stamina*?” Her grin turned wicked. “A hundred percent true. You better *prepare yourself*, sister. You’re not jusclimbing a mountain, you’re scaling a volcano!”

I froze. My soul left my body. The sun didn’t exist anymore it straight up imploded. The strayu fell from my paws.

“I-Kaija-” I squeaked.

“Hey, just giving a fellow lady some tips!” she said sweetly, sipping her drink like she hadn’t just detonated my psyche. “You think you’re ready, but then *bam!* You’re seeing stars, crying for your homeworld, wondering how you ended up on the predator’s plate!.”

“I WANNA DIE.”

Kaija laughed so hard she was practically wheezing.

“I'm going to implode,” I groaned, slumping against the table. “Turn into a starless void. Leave behind nothing but shame particles.”

“Oh come on,” she said, wiping tears from her eyes. “You’ve faced death, Arxur,  broken bones, gunfire and *this* is what takes you out?”

“Yes,” I moaned. “This is it. This is how I die.”

Kaija just chuckled again, that cursed sound echoing through the terminal breakroom like a bell tolling my doom.

—-

We left the terminal under the dusky sky, the clouds painted in shades of lavender and smog. Kaija’s gait had finally evened out, though I wasn’t sure if that was because her legs stopped hurting or because she was too tired to sass.

Her apartment was tucked into a wedge-shaped building that looked like it had been dropped from orbit and never quite recovered. The hallway's air tasted like someone’s failed attempt at spice bread and maybe a little mold, but her unit was clean (if cluttered) and welcoming. Throw pillows everywhere. Pictures of her family. A small, very dead plant in the window that she swore was ""just dormant.""

“Help yourself to the cold shelf,” she muttered, dropping her bag with a thud. “I’m gonna peel out of this uniform before it fuses with my spine.”

I flicked my ears in affirmation and padded into the little kitchen nook. The cold shelf buzzed faintly. I found some berry soda, popped it open, and took a grateful sip. It was sweet, fizzy, and exactly what I needed. When Kaija returned, wool fluffed, ears drooping slightly, we flopped onto her wide sleeping mat like a pair of overcooked root tubes.

No ceremony. No dramatics. Just two Venlil completely wrung out.

For a few minutes, we just lay there, tails half-tangled and heads back to back. The silence wasn't awkward, it was warm. Familiar.

But there was one more thing I needed to do before I could even *think* about rest.

I rolled over and grabbed my pad from my bag, screen lighting up my face in the low twilight. I hesitated for only a moment, then started typing.

**TYLA:** Hey. I'm at Kaija's place now. We're safe. Everything's okay.

I stared at the blinking cursor. Should I say more? Was that too cold? No, he’d get it. He always got it.

His reply came faster than I expected.

**VALENTÍN:** Glad to hear it. You deserve a good ladies' night. Even if it’s not technically “night.” ;)

That weird, quiet warmth again. Like curling up near a campfire.

Another message came through.

**VALENTÍN:** Anyway I gotta help Wash fix one of the shelter cars. He hit a support pillar. With the \*rear\*. Don’t ask.

I laughed.

**TYLA:** You have the patience of a deity. Seriously, good luck with that.

**TYLA:** …I miss you dearly. We’ll see each other next paw, okay?

A pause. Then:

**VALENTÍN:** Can’t wait. Sweet dreams, soldier.

I tucked the pad under the mat and closed my eyes.

The room was still, save for the sound of the air circulator and Kaija's soft breathing beside me. Her wool brushed mine lightly, warm and familiar. I thought she was already out cold.

But then she stirred. Just a little.

""Hey,"" she murmured, voice muffled by the blanket half-draped over her face. “You should bring that human of yours over next paw.”

I blinked, turning my head slightly. “Huh?”

Kaija didn't move, but I could *feel* the grin in her tone.

“*Alone.*”

“…Why?”

A pause. Then a chuckle, low and devilish.

“No reason. Just thinkin’ you two deserve… some space. Maybe even a door that *locks.*”

I frowned, ears flicking in confusion. “Kaija, what are you-?”

“Nothing. I’m asleep,” she mumbled quickly, burrowing deeper into the blankets with an exaggerated yawn. “Just a sleepy little innocent Venlil. Don’t read into it.”

“Kaija.”

“Shh. Shhhhh. Gone. Not here. Dreaming of pies and totally normal things.”

I groaned, tugging the blanket over my head.

“Your brain’s made of soup.”

“Thank you\~,” she chirped faintly, then finally fell still.

I lay there, the warmth of her body beside mine and the glow of Val’s last message still lingering in my chest.

I didn’t *entirely* get what she was hinting at.

But… maybe tomorrow would be a good paw to see him again.

Alone.

Just to talk. Obviously.

Probably.

OK… this is my first Reddit post (go easy on me 😅), but I figured—why not take the plunge? My name’s Matt (36M), and like many of us here, I’m looking to meet some new people this summer.

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in starting a weekly or bi-weekly social meetup. We could pick a regular day and rotate through different activities—coffee catchups, museum visits, pickup basketball or pickleball, grabbing food/drinks, or catching a Sox game (or any game, really). Maybe even some mini golf or bowling? Totally open to ideas!

I know there are existing meetup groups out there, but I thought it could be fun to start something a little more casual and community-driven here.

No pressure at all—just putting the idea out there to see if it resonates with anyone. If you’re interested (or have suggestions for fun social stuff), drop a comment!

Not every campsite is perfect. It might have a great tent spot but little firewood. But you're too tired to go somewhere else so you make it your own. Put on dry clothes, and set up your tent. You cook up a walley and have coffee. It's not just a campsite anymore but home.

When it comes morning, you have to take down the tent that looked so good in the sunset. What was just a place is now in your memories or a great campsite, and whenever you look at a map, your eyes linger on this spot, and the memories will come back to you.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Fluminense vs. Al-Hilal: A Tactical Tug-of-War in the FIFA Club World Cup Quarterfinals**

**The Setup:**  
Fluminense, the Brazilian underdogs with a defensive record tighter than a goalkeeper’s grip (three clean sheets in their last three games), face off against Al-Hilal, the Saudi League runners-up who’ve got more star power than a Hollywood premiere. Al-Hilal’s attacking trio—led by Marcos Leonardo, who’s as reliable as a coffee machine in the third quarter of a match—knocked out Man City in a thriller. Fluminense? They’ve got the defensive grit of a locked door and the midfield creativity of a spreadsheet full of puns.

**The Odds Breakdown:**

* **Moneyline:** Al-Hilal is the slight favorite (-125 implied probability), but Fluminense (-115 implied) isn’t far behind. The draw? At +310, it’s basically a free bet if you’re into gridlock.
* **Totals:** The Under 2.5 goals is favored (-115), which makes sense if Fluminense’s defense keeps playing like a brick wall.
* **Prop Bet Alert:** Both teams to score is -135, and with Al-Hilal’s offense and Fluminense’s recent scoring streaks, this feels like a sure thing.

**Player Props to Watch:**

* **Marcos Leonardo (Al-Hilal):** The man’s a goal machine. His anytime goal price is 148, which is basically “buy now, ask questions later.”
* **German Cano (Fluminense):** Priced at 265 for a goal, he’s the dark horse in a match that could hinge on a single strike.

**The Verdict:**  
This is a game where Al-Hilal’s star power meets Fluminense’s defensive discipline. If Al-Hilal’s attack can break through Fluminense’s brick wall, they’ll advance. But if Fluminense’s midfield can suffocate the Saudis and capitalize on counterattacks? *Game of the tournament*.

**Prediction:**  
Al-Hilal in 90 minutes (+0.25 on the spread), but **both teams score**. Bet the Under if you trust Fluminense’s defense, but if you’re feeling spicy, ride Marcos Leonardo to net the opener.

**Final Score Prediction:** Al-Hilal 2, Fluminense 1. (Because even underdogs need a day off.)

I had unexpected things happen this pay period that was unavoidable that I had to pay so I’m just glad I was able to cover that, even if it means having $5 to last me a few days haha. 

So basically I’m just going to be sitting here in my house all weekend, luckily I have groceries to last me a few days and my cats have food, I don’t really NEED anything. Very thankful. I have a long weekend though because I work in finance so my job was closed today, so I have a few days of no alarms, and I was thinking this would be such a perfect time to get into a video game!! I have the switch, and I’ve always wanted to get into Stardew Valley. I mean I watch videos and let’s play on this game all the time, but I’ve never experienced it for myself!!! 

I just want to build my little farm, and run around meeting all of the different characters! You can even get married and have kids in this game! People get so addicted to it and I just want to get absorbed into the world and forget about all of my problems and burdens for a little bit. Just pour a cup of my ice coffee and stay up way too late ❤️

So that is why I am here on Reddit asking for something like that! I know it’s not important, I just haven’t had the time or the finances to be able to just throw away $15 like that.

[$3500],"My partner and I are looking to open a small takeaway cafe kiosk and are deciding between the Profitec 700 drive ($4200) and Lelit Bianca V3 ($3200). From our research, the specs seem really similar, other than the slight difference in the boiler sizes, and that the Profitec has a more solid and bigger built.

This coffee machine is meant for a small takeaway coffee business and our budget was originally around $3500 and we are wondering if the Profitec is worth the extra $1000. We are hoping to get a machine that could pull back to back shots well, we've seen some comments on how some Bianca V3s would need 3-4 minutes to cool down after 4 shots. Haven't seen any comments on the Profitec for this, hence am guessing that it is significantly(?) more reliable when it comes to pulling many shots at a time?

Hope we could get some user experience and recommendations thanks!",1,1751644455.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Very surprising stuff. My local Starbucks is also staffed by straights currently.

I actually am a straight male barista myself, but I work in a cafe inside a massive grocery store so I never really felt very special and have never been accused of being gay. The one lgbtq+/fat employee we had actually recently quit for mental health reasons, but my manager (who was literally a 20 year old girl btw) was on the verge of firing her because she would find any excuse to yell at the younger employees (always the skinny ones btw, much to think about) 

(also, side note, this 20 year old manager literally fired 3 people in her only few months on the job, all foreign student workers lmao I miss her so much) 

Anyways Im thinking maybe the lqbtqs overplayed their hand suing/unionizing beloved American conglomerate Starbucks, and are now being forced out of the industry. 

I think outside of North America it is actually a straight coded job anyways, like if you go to France or Italy, I feel like there’s maybe a better chance of seeing an old guy making your latte than a gay blue haired individual.",0,1751644443.0,redscarepod,6,0.5,False

1lrlyo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1lrlyo0/marriage_from_hell/,Marriage from Hell,"Salam everyone.

I (23F at the time) met this man (29M at the time) on Muzz in 2023. Right off the bat, he seemed like a good and religious man. I wanted to involve my parents since I was serious about getting married and not dating around. He agreed and I saw that as a green flag, after about a week of texting and meeting once for coffee, he had his parents call mine and he came over to meet my parents. He was very impressive and met some of my other family over the next few weeks who also liked him. His parents came to Canada and we got engaged and planned to get married in December 2024. There were some hiccups along the way, which I should have seen as red flags but of course hindsight is 20/20. I loved him a lot, he was my everything and I could only imagine my life with him. My parents also liked him, this was our first experience marrying outside the family so they thought not everything can align with their expectations which is okay.

We got married in December 2024 and the first few weeks were great for the most part (with of course some minor bumps along the way but nothing TOO major or unexplainable). We travelled a bit and then returned home to begin work. I was living with his parents as they had not gone back yet after the wedding. Here is where the problems began, I used to ask my husband to call my father every so often as they did not have much of a relationship, to which he always refused. He had a major issue with all the ""shaadi dawats"" my side wanted to host for us, even though they listened to his wishes and did not host anything immediately after the wedding but rather after our honeymoon. However, he gave his family friends dates for dinners without even consulting me. All of this was still manageable, my biggest problem was that he did not allow me to visit my parents' more than once every three weeks. I did not ask to spend the night but I also was not able to go spend the day unless he allowed me. If I saw them at a dinner (which were to only be scheduled on a three week frequency) I could not go home. My parents started to catch on to these patterns but kept quiet as I told them I was happy.

He was clearly very controlling and dominating, I would make a conscious attempt to listen and follow to the best of my ability so that there were no arguments but ultimately I would get homesick and wanted to see my family as well. He would drive my car around and would not allow me to use my car to visit my parents or even meet my siblings midway. The worst was his abuse, he was emotionally very abusive and would make me feel like I was worth less than him and that I needed to do more for him and his family to prove my love for him. He was verbally abusive and would use foul language towards me and ask me to ""sit"" on the ground in front of him during arguments otherwise I could go home that night. Unfortunately, the one thing I did not think he would be was physically abusive, and he was that as well. He put his hands on me to slap me, grab my face and wrists, he rolled the car window up my arm and put a pillow over my face. He convinced me that he only did this because I was latching on and not giving him space - I began to believe it.

Eventually my parents found out about his control issues and they came to his house, he was very disrespectful to them and argued with my dad about ""not giving me permission to leave."" After some back and forth, I eventually came back to my parents' house to take a ""break"" which turned into our separation as he was not able to compromise or be flexible at all. He wanted it to work but he also wanted me to sign a post-nup agreement to only ever work from home and take care of his parents, meanwhile I would not be allowed to see mine unless it was on his pre-determined frequency.

During my separation, I found out that he lied about his past. He very frequently consumed alcohol, he slept with many girls and told me he had never, he ghosted his ex of 3 years when he found me on Muzz because I was Shia and he wanted to marry someone who was Shia as well. Safe to say, I got screwed over by this man.

I just turned 24 and am now going through a divorce. Although I am much better now than I was a few months ago. It is upsetting for me to go through all this. He is no longer communicating with anyone for my religious divorce, his family ghosted mine in this entire process and he did not give even a portion of my mehr. I am upset because I have so much love in me and I was such a good wife, which was all wasted on him. I miss being married and not because of the dates/dressing up/showing him off but I miss the mundane things like going grocery shopping and watching tv with someone. The Shia community is already so small and to now add divorced to it, I fear I will not be able to get remarried and settle down and have the life I hoped and dreamed of.

1lrly4i,https://www.purevpn.com/white-label/cybersecurity-msp-pricing-guide/,MSP Pricing Guide Cybersecurity with Built-In Revenue Calculator,"Like many MSPs, we’d been coasting on a simple **per-device** model for years: $75 per device, per month. It was easy to quote, clients understood it, and we thought it was “good enough.” Then:

* **Support tickets exploded.** As clients added more devices (IoT, printers, mobile), our per-device overhead spiked.  
* **Clients resisted rate increases.** We tried modest bumps—“just $5 a device”—but got pushback.  
* **Margins sank by 7–10% annually.** Tool licensing, labor costs, and compliance overhead outpaced our pricing.  

At our last quarterly review, I realized: **we were burning money** whenever a client invested in additional security or endpoints. If we didn’t change our approach, we’d soon be under 30% gross margin—and that’s a recipe for burnout (and burnout isn’t just a human problem; it’s a business problem).



# Why One-Size-Fits-All Pricing No Longer Works

In 2025, three big shifts have reshaped MSP economics:

1. **Cybersecurity Demands:** Clients now expect more than antivirus—SOC services, EDR, threat hunting, zero-trust networks. Those tools and analysts come at a premium.  
2. **Hybrid & Remote Work:** Support used to be tethered to desks. Now every employee logs in from home, coffee shops, Airbnb rentals…so you need VPNs, SASE, cloud desktops, and hardened endpoints everywhere.  
3. **Compliance Complexity:** Healthcare, finance, legal—everyone’s under regulatory pressure. Audits, reporting, data-sovereignty rules add labor and tooling costs that didn’t exist five years ago.  

Throw those into a flat per-device bucket, and you end up eating costs or nickel-and-diming clients—neither is sustainable.



# Building a Hybrid Pricing Framework

After a ton of brainstorming (and a lot of whiteboarding), we landed on a **three-pillar hybrid model**:

1. **Core Per-User Base Fee**  
2. **Tiered Service Packages**  
3. **A La Carte Security Add-Ons**  

Here’s how we structured it:



# 1. Core Per-User Base Fee

We shifted our “bread and butter” to **$175 per user, per month**, covering:

* Up to three devices (laptop, desktop, phone)  
* 24/7 remote monitoring & patch management  
* Standard help-desk (8×5, next-business-day on-site)  
* Base antivirus & endpoint protection  

**Why per-user?**

* Predictable for clients: one line item per employee  
* Scales automatically with headcount growth  
* Encourages them to onboard devices officially  
* We avoid chasing phantom printers or oddball IoT devices  



# 2. Tiered Service Packages

On top of the base fee, we offer three clearly defined tiers—Bronze, Silver, Gold—so clients can upgrade into higher-value support:

||
||
|**Tier**|**Price (per user/mo)**|**What's Included**|
|**Bronze**|$175|Base fee (above), next-business-day on-site, basic monitoring|
|**Silver**|\+$50 (total $225)|24/7 help desk, quarterly vulnerability scans, enhanced SLAs|
|**Gold**|\+$125 (total $300)|All Silver + SOC-as-a-service, proactive threat hunting, compliance reporting|

**Why tiered?**

* Clients see clear “steps” to get more value.  
* We protect ourselves: higher tiers cover our highest-cost services.  
* We can upsell during quarterly reviews by showing what they’re missing.  



# 3. A La Carte Security Add-Ons

Finally, we created a catalog of optional modules that clients can bolt on:

* **Managed VPN/SASE:** $20/user/mo  
* **Security Awareness Training:** $15/user/mo  
* **Disaster Recovery Backup:** $30/device/mo  
* **Password Management Platform:** $10/user/mo  

These add-ons are high-margin and deliver tangible ROI: fewer breaches, faster recoveries, and happier auditors.



# Rolling It Out: Tips & Tricks

Switching models can be nerve-wracking. Here’s how we did it smoothly:

1. **Pilot with a Willing Client:** We chose an existing 50-user client to test the new structure. We offered them Silver tier at a discounted rate in exchange for candid feedback. That pilot proved we could deliver *and* maintain margins.  
2. **Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs):** We schedule one-hour sessions to present metrics: ticket reduction, patch compliance, threat alerts. Then we walk through how the new tiers and add-ons solve their pain points.  
3. **Data-Driven Conversations:** Instead of “we need to raise rates,” we say, “Last quarter we blocked 23 ransomware attempts—our SOC service pays for itself.”  
4. **Grace Period & Migration Plan:** Clients stay on legacy pricing for three months while they evaluate the new model. After that, they migrate automatically unless they opt-out. Only one client did—we let them stay on per-device for another cycle, then they switched.  



# Lessons Learned

After six months, here’s what we discovered:

* **Average Revenue per User (ARPU) jumped 22%.**  
* **Gross margins stabilized at 55–60%.**  
* **Client churn dropped by 18%.** People valued the predictable, transparent pricing.  
* **Upsell success rate of 40%.** Almost half of our base-fee clients added at least one security module.  

But it wasn’t all smooth:

* **Complexity can confuse.** We had to simplify our tier comparison chart to three columns and highlight “Your current plan.”  
* **Sales training is essential.** Our account managers needed scripts to explain the value of each tier/add-on without sounding pushy.  
* **Tool integration matters.** We now automate billing changes via our PSA, or it becomes an administrative nightmare.  



# Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overcomplicating Tiers:** Too many levels or sub-tiers lead to analysis paralysis. Stick to three.  
2. **Selling Price Before Value:** Always lead with outcomes—reduced incidents, faster recovery—then tie that to the cost.  
3. **Ignoring Cost Drivers:** Track license fees, labor hours, and on-site visits. If you don’t cost it, you can’t price it.  
4. **Creeping Scope:** Define each service boundary clearly. If a client wants non-standard support, charge for it.  



# Why Cybersecurity Belongs at the Core

In 2025, basic break-fix is dead. Clients expect holistic security:

* **VPN/SASE** to secure hybrid workers  
* **EDR & MDR** to catch advanced threats  
* **Patch Management** to close up vulnerabilities  
* **Training & Phishing Simulations** to harden the human layer  

Treating security as an optional bolt-on leaves you vulnerable to commoditization. Embed at least some core security in your base fee—clients will thank you.



# Your Turn: What’s Working for You?

I’d love to open the floor to this community:

* Have you made similar shifts in 2025?  
* Which models or tiers have yielded the best ROI?  
* How do you manage the transition for long-standing clients?  
* Any horror stories or triumphs around pricing changes?

1lrlvrb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lrlvrb,Unsure if I am being abducted,"Hello everyone, a few of you might have seen my post last week where while listening to the Gateway Tapes I was shown an Arcturian during the meditation and that night I saw an orb. After said event I have reasons to believe I may have been abducted twice but I would like your opinion and I would be very grateful to get your thoughts on my experiences.
Forgive my english, I am still learning.
The pictures are of the orange star that I saw during the first encounter and that has only been present the nights when those nightmares/abductions have taken place. It always stands in the middle of the sea, it is brighter than all the other stars and orange and is nowhere to be seen on other nights despite the fact that there are no clouds, nor have I seen it before those encounters.

Two days after the sighting I woke up in the middle of the night to the sight of 3 grey aliens in my room after spending the whole day feeling...extremely strange. The whole day I had been fighting an abnormal sleepiness that didn't go away no matter how much coffee I drink or even if I ran, when I say abnormal sleepiness I really mean it as my body would start being paralyzed like in sleep paralysis if I stayed still for more than a couple of seconds and that I had to fight passing out the whole day until night came and I was unable to do so anymore. The feeling was accompanied by intense thoughts about being abducted despite never having those thoughts in my entire life. The feeling was so strong that I felt the need to take another shower, clean my room and wear a new pajama just in case as I was embarassed about it haha.

As a child I often had sleep paralysis, I never stopped having it but the hallucinations went away once I became an adult and I haven't had them for many years. Unlike with sleep paralysis I had no sense of fear or of dread, in fact I felt strangely numb.
The aliens were 3, one of them was standing to the side of my bed by my feet and staring straight ahead, the second one was standing sideway further in my bedroom bent over....something that wasn't there, it was as if he was searching or moving things except there was no surface to nove things from, when I tried to focus on what he was doing the room became hazy and looked ""wrong"" for a second not allowing me to see what it was doing. The third alien was standing behind the first, his back was to me and his head slightly bent as if he was looking at something on the ground or on a surface that was not there.

All of the aliens looked extremely...real. 
Their bodies were very lean, their bones and their muscles, down to a couple of small rolls of skin on the lower stomach of the one that was crouched forward. Evrrything was so vivid. Their skin was grey and their eyes black and much larger than most illustrations and almond shaped, their chin was very very small and square instead of pointy and they wore no clothing. They also had no nipples, navel or genitalia.
As soon as I saw them I became aware of a pressure on my lower abdomen, it didn't hurt but it was as if someone was pressing on it with two fingers, I tried to get up, I lifted one hand off the bed and at the same time my eyes met the eyes of the first grey at the side of my bed, he had been staring straight ahead as if he didn't want to look at me but the moment I looked in his eyes I felt as if I could feel his mind, I don't know how else to explain it, I felt something similar to annoyance but much more mellow and I was knocked out instantly. I woke up another time during the same night, probably only a couple of minutes later, I knew they were still there and moving around but I didn't manage to wake up fully.

In the morning I didn't know what to think especially about the fact that I felt numb and not scared during the encounter, I ended up making a post on /alienabduction and got told it was sleep paralysis and so I deleted it.

Two or three days later however I had another experience, the same strange feeling took over me but this time I didn't fight it as much as it was 2:30 AM. I woke up exactly 1 hour and a half later at 4 PM with the feeling of being gently lowered on my bed. I always sleep with the lamp on but the room was entirely dark. I jumped out of the bed, I was terrified and ran to turn the light on but it didn't work.
I was so scared and so I ran towards the window and tried to lift the shutter, in that same moment I thought about them and begged them to turn the light on and...the current came back. 
From this second encounter that apprently lasted only half an hour (if it even happened at all) I remember only one thing, I was lying down and I saw their faces above me, they were illuminated by a white light (the one in my room is yellow), I remember screaming and covering my eyes and face with both hands and being apologetic while doing so as I didn't want to be scared of them but I was absolutely terrified. As I did so I felt some sort of feeling from them, it was once again very very mellow with the smallest hint of annoyance but I also felt that they were going to stop whatever they were doing, I don't think the feeling was directed at me, it felt more like I picked up on it.

The following morning unlike the first time where I had no signs on my body I had a large oval bruise on the back of my calf as well as numerous scratches on both sides of my thighs. 
I also went made myself throw up as soon as I woke up this second time as I had read that sometimes they make you drink things and I wanted some sort of proof, but nothing came up.

So. Am I going insane? Is it sleep paralysis? Or am I really being abducted? I would be extremely grateful for your opinion and would live to know if any of you went through a similar experience. 
I will also say that I am autistic just in case it is relevant since it seems that many autistic people are experiencers.",5,1751643766.0,Experiencers,3,0.86,False

‍

**Why This Pick?**

I’m not a fan of Minnesota starter Chris Paddack (4.70 ERA), friends. The Twins have lost 4 of his last 5 starts, and to be honest, Minnesota has been on the struggle bus for a while now having won just 5 of their last 20 games. Both teams are coming off a series loss, but the Rays have far and away been the more reliable money maker. Despite Tampa Bay starter Zack Littell (3.61 ERA) being a little shaky, he’s managed to log an even 7 wins & 7 losses – Paddack is a mere 3-7. I’m on Tampa Bay to snag a victory on the road this evening.

Think: fixing stuff around the house, helping neighbors with yard work, that kind of thing. Online work? Total mystery to him.

Last fall, he started asking me if I knew of any remote jobs that didn’t involve talking on the phone. He’s not a fan of Zoom or customer service stuff. I told him I’d look around, but most listings either wanted experience or felt a little too “get rich quick.”

Eventually, he stumbled on a site (not naming it here for obvious reasons) that offered small writing gigs. Think short blurbs for everyday items — nothing longform. Just simple stuff like: “Write 100 words describing this garden hose” or “Create a short review for this electric kettle.”

He was super skeptical — thought it had to be a scam — but after watching some videos and reading through the fine print, he gave it a try. He submitted a sample, waited, and got accepted.

A couple of weeks later, he emailed me a screenshot of his first payment: $74.50 for a batch of product descriptions. He was over the moon.

Now he’s been doing it on and off — not full-time, just whenever he has a quiet morning or rainy afternoon. He says it’s kind of relaxing, and he’s slowly gotten more comfortable with Google Docs and basic formatting. No Zoom calls. No awkward phone stuff. Just him, his laptop, and a cup of black coffee.

It’s not a goldmine, but he averages a couple hundred bucks a month, which for him is solid beer money and helps cover groceries.

Not saying it’s for everyone, but if you’ve got a good grip on written English and are okay doing repetitive but easy tasks, these kinds of side gigs do exist. Just steer clear of anything asking for big upfront payments, and take the time to read the fine print. Most of the time, caution pays off.",1,1751643577.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

I’m 23 years old, I live with my parents, and I work full-time in my dad’s business. From the outside, maybe it looks like I have stability  a home, a job, a family. But the truth is, I don’t feel free. At all.

Everything I do is watched. Since I work with my dad, it’s like I can’t ever really leave their sight. If I try to go out even just once a month  to see a friend or grab a coffee, it turns into a fight. They interrogate me. Last time, they even went through my phone, convinced I was either meeting a girl, doing drugs, or drinking.

I wasn’t. I just wanted to spend a couple hours with people who make me feel alive. People who let me be myself.

But even if I was doing any of those things... I’m an adult. I know what’s right and wrong. I’m not reckless. I’m just trying to live a little. But in their eyes, it’s like the only life I’m allowed to live is the one they control ,wake up, work, come home, eat, sleep. Repeat.

I have ADHD. I told my mom about it once  just casually. We were reading something online together that said people with ADHD need support and understanding from their family. Somehow, she took that to mean I need to be completely controlled. Like I’m incapable of making decisions on my own. Now everything is on their schedule. I have to sleep when they say. Wake up when they say. I feel like I’m constantly under scrutiny like any small mistake proves I’m broken or ungrateful.

They don’t see the good things I do. They don’t count the days I show up, work hard, help around the house, keep my head down. But the moment I slip  even a little ,it’s like I’m the worst person in the world. Either I’m being guilt-tripped, emotionally manipulated, or scolded for hours.

It’s like walking on eggshells, every single day. I can’t breathe.

I know other people have harder lives, and I don’t want to make this sound like I’m the only one struggling. But it’s been 23 years of this. Of being watched, judged, controlled. I don’t even hate my home , I just hate what it turns me into when they’re around. I enjoy peace and quiet, I enjoy solitude… but not like this. Not when it's forced.

I want to go out. I want to meet people. I want to figure out who I am outside of their expectations. But I can’t even move out . I don’t get a salary from the family business. I’m financially stuck.

I don’t know what I’m hoping for by posting this. Maybe just to feel heard. Maybe someone out there has lived through something like this and came out the other side. I just needed to let it out somewhere.

Because I’m exhausted. And I just want to feel free.",5,1751643271.0,india,12,0.86,False

I’ve been doing good with no vaping for 7 months now. It was really hard at first but got easier. I was never one for cigarettes. I tried them a few times when I was actively vaping but honestly they weren’t strong enough. I got a pack of cigarettes the other day during a fight with my bf. I didn’t smoke them that day. I told my therapist I’d get rid of them before I got around to smoking them but then I did. I impulsively smoked like 3 throughout last night and one this morning with coffee. I’m not going to let myself pick it up because 1. It’s so expensive, 2. I don’t want to go through quitting again, and 3. I honestly don’t think it’s worth the risk of cancer and other illnesses. When I was vaping towards the end I got really sick. I could barely eat and lost like 20 pounds and I could barely breathe, I still struggle with breathing to this day. I’m over it but there’s still that part of me that craves nicotine I guess. Maybe I fucked up big time. Idk. I have the urge to smoke more. But the good thing is that if I quit now I won’t have to go through withdrawal. So I’m just going to try and stop before I really start, you know? I just wanted to post this because it’s kinda sucky.

Calloway,"Three years ago, a car accident shattered Roselyn’s dreams of becoming a star dancer. Patrick King, her devoted fiancé, promised to care for her forever, convincing her to marry him. But on their wedding night, Patrick abandoned her to attend the debut of Ivanna Shaw, the company’s new lead dancer. As Roselyn uncovers Patrick’s betrayal and the truth behind the accident, she realizes her marriage is built on lies. Now, she’s determined to leave him—and make him pay. But as secrets unravel, Roselyn discovers Patrick’s motives may be darker than she ever imagined. What really happened that fateful night? And how far will Patrick go to keep the truth buried?

# Chapter 1 - The Shattered Dream and the Betrayal

The car accident three years ago shattered my dreams of ever stepping onto the stage I loved so dearly.

Patrick King told me it was just an unfortunate accident, and that if I married him, he would take care of me for the rest of my life.

But on our wedding night, he left me alone to attend the debut performance of Ivanna Shaw, the company’s new lead dancer.

When I presented the divorce papers to set us free, Patrick flew into a rage, demanding to know why I didn’t love him anymore, why I wanted a divorce.

Why? Because back then, I didn’t know that he was the one who had crushed my dreams with his own hands.

Now that the truth is out, of course I want a divorce, and more than that, I want Patrick to lose everything.

==============================

On the night of our wedding, Patrick didn’t come home.

Instead, he went to support Ivanna Shaw’s debut performance as the new lead dancer.

I stared at the gossip news popping up on my phone.

""Why did Mr. King abandon his new wife on their wedding night to attend Ivanna Shaw’s performance?""

""Is there something going on between Mr. King and Ivanna Shaw?""

""Was Mr. King’s marriage to his new wife truly out of love?""

I couldn’t believe it. Patrick had always been so good to me, never putting me in such an embarrassing position before.

But the Patrick who had just completed our wedding ceremony today seemed like a completely different person.

In disbelief, I called Patrick’s number.

A girl answered on the other end—it was Ivanna Shaw.

She said Patrick was in the shower and wouldn’t be coming home tonight.

Then, what sounded like Patrick’s voice came through, distant, as if he was far away.

He was telling Ivanna to hurry up and shower, as if he couldn’t wait.

I didn’t want to hear anymore and frantically ended the call.

Just like that, Patrick didn’t come home that night.

The next day, even more explosive gossip headlines dominated the news.

""Famous dancer Ivanna Shaw spotted leaving a hotel with a man suspected to be Mr. King.""

The news was sensational, but my heart was frozen.

Patrick, why did you go through all the trouble to be so good to me, only to abandon me like this after we got married?

I wanted to call Patrick and get some answers.

After more than a dozen unanswered calls, Patrick’s secretary called me to say that Patrick’s phone was with him.

Patrick was in a meeting and couldn’t take my calls, so I should stop calling.

It felt like Patrick was deliberately avoiding me, so I decided to go to his office.

But when I arrived at his company, there was no meeting happening in the conference room.

In Patrick’s office, however, there was another woman—Ivanna Shaw.

# Chapter 2 - The Weight of Betrayal

When I pushed open the office door, Ivanna Shaw was perched on Patrick King’s lap, cooing and asking him to throw a celebration party for her. Patrick, noticing the intrusion, immediately grabbed a folder from his desk and hurled it toward the door without even looking up.

""Didn’t I say no one was allowed in? Mitchell Hughes, are you trying to get fired?""

He didn’t even bother to see who had entered, his irritation palpable at being interrupted. The folder struck my leg, and the sharp pain made me wince. Only then did Patrick glance toward the door.

I demanded to know why.

Ivanna, sensing the tension, tried to make herself scarce. In a syrupy voice, she told Patrick she’d be waiting for him in their usual hotel room that evening, adding that she didn’t want to intrude on our conversation. But as she attempted to stand and leave, Patrick’s hand firmly gripped her waist, pulling her back.

""She can hear this,"" he said, his voice icy.

The pressure of his hand made Ivanna let out a soft gasp. Patrick didn’t answer my question, but his hands continued to roam over Ivanna’s body, shameless and deliberate. My face burned with anger and humiliation as I yanked Ivanna away from him.

I stared at Patrick and demanded again, ""Why? Why are you doing this to me?""

He looked at me, his expression cold and detached, and said, ""Now it’s your turn to know what it feels like to be ignored.""

With that, he shoved me aside, wrapped his arm around Ivanna, and strode out of the office.

Patrick’s sudden change in behavior left me stunned. Just two days ago, he had been tender, calling me Roselyn, promising to love and care for me for the rest of my life. He had vowed to help me overcome the shadow of the accident, to stand by me as I healed. But as soon as the wedding ceremony ended, everything seemed to shift.

As I left his office, I overheard some employees whispering. They said that since I could no longer dance, I was worthless. Ivanna, on the other hand, had both beauty and talent. She was the rising star of the dance world, and she had been openly in love with Patrick since she was eighteen, her devotion unwavering.

Patrick had endured my stubborn and difficult personality for three years, and now he had finally seen the light. Falling for Ivanna wasn’t surprising.

But if he loved her so much, why had he married me first, only to openly flaunt his affair with her afterward?

I wandered the streets in a daze, memories of the past three years flooding my mind.

# Chapter 3 - The Accident That Changed Everything

When the car accident occurred, I wasn’t alone in the car—my senior from the dance company, Jesse Mendez, was with me. Jesse was two years ahead of me, and I had just started making a name for myself in the company.

I had saved up a year’s worth of my internship salary to ask Jesse to help me buy a watch. It was from a luxury brand, and Jesse mentioned he knew a sales associate who could get me one without the usual waitlist. In exchange, I had to help him train for a duet for two months—his partner had relapsed with an old injury, and he needed someone to practice with. I agreed.

For the next two months, on top of my own training, I spent an extra two hours every day practicing with Jesse. Two days before Patrick’s birthday, Jesse told me he had arranged with the sales associate, and we could go pick up the watch that day.

But on our way to the mall, the accident happened. Jesse was immediately taken away by his family, while I lay unconscious in the hospital for a full day and night before I woke up.

When I came to, Patrick looked at me with a strange expression and told me I’d never be able to dance again. Hearing that, I lost it, trying to stand up to prove I could. But my legs, encased in casts, wouldn’t budge. Any attempt to move sent sharp, searing pain through them.

From that day on, I became withdrawn, speaking very little. The only thing that gnawed at me was guilt over Jesse. He didn’t have to come with me that day. It was because he was helping me buy a gift for Patrick that he got caught in the accident.

Whenever I brought up Jesse, Patrick’s face would darken. He told me Jesse came from a prominent family in the city and would be fine—he had already been sent abroad for treatment.

Under Patrick’s meticulous care, I was discharged from the hospital. He brought me to his villa, hiring a housekeeper to look after me while he was at work. No matter how busy he was, he always came home to have dinner with me and made sure I had warm coffee in the morning.

He took care of me like this for three years, helping me let go of my obsession and convincing me to marry him, to live a simple, happy life together.

But in the past few days, Patrick’s personality had changed drastically, hitting me like a bolt out of the blue. I was caught completely off guard, unable to make sense of what was happening.

When I returned home, drenched from the rain, I was in a daze. I wanted to go to my room and change my clothes. But when I opened the door, Patrick was there, and my computer was still on.

He had gone through my email history. He knew I was still in touch with Jesse. Jesse’s rehabilitation abroad was going well, and I wanted to ask if there was still a chance for me to return to the stage.

Seeing me nervously checking my email for a reply, Patrick suddenly lunged at me like an enraged lion, pinning me down on the bed. His eyes were bloodshot as he demanded, “Why? I’ve taken care of you for three years. We’re married now, and you’re still thinking about going abroad to find Jesse?”

# Chapter 4 - A Desperate Plea and a Broken Trust

I think Patrick must have lost his mind. I just wanted to ask Jesse about my rehabilitation—what did he mean by going abroad to find him?I tried to break free from his grip, but the harder I struggled, the tighter he held on.....

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? No. I have a broder aussie and aussie currently. Have had labs and a husky. 
2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)? No
3. Describe your ideal dog. Love Aussies. How smart they are, in tune they are. My next breed I'd love to compete in sports (they can pick after we try some out) and do training but the emotional strain my aussie has with FOMO can be draining. He never really got an off switch. I'd definitely do things differently if I got another aussie puppy (more calm training and less drive training)
4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? Love my aussie and my BC but my next dog I'd like to be able to take to coffee shops and more regular stuff. Right now my aussie and I do a lot of dog sports and hikes. 
5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? tricks, scent work, rally (current aussie hates this one), I'd like him to be more off leash. This year (he is 5) he now hates cats and fireworks and previous summers he was fine with both--health is fine)
6. Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? Currently I compete in agility, rally (used to), nosework, shed hunt, fetch. 

**Care Commitments**

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? I'm still okay with a few hours a day. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? Walking, obedience work, scent work, agility. I change it up dependent on what my dog needs. 

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? Yes. I already do all that myself. 

**Personal Preferences**

10) What size dog are you looking for? 30-60 pounds is good for me

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? NO slobber, shedding is fine, less barking

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? Id like more snuggle. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? Eager to please. 

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? Wait for a go see command. Otherwise be neutral. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? no. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid? Less FOMO. We still have to do a lot of separation training with current dog (he can't seem to settle with outside stimulus)

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? 8 hours.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? Other human would prefer a dog that does nothing and listens to him despite not wanting to train the dog at all. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? Id love to have two dogs at a time. I tried to introduce another male (to make 3 dogs) and current aussie did not enjoy that dog getting attention from me. So we had to have a lot of separation. I don't want labs but I do love how they all lay around on each other. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? No, but needs to be neutral to them. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? No.

1lrlidi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lrlidi/what_we_are_without_them/,What We Are Without Them,"((When the children of Earth fall silent, humanity loses not only its future but the very reason it chose to be gentle. In grief’s shadow, priests, teachers, scientists, and ordinary souls wrestle with rage and vengeance. *In the Absence of Children*, even peace itself may die.))



The first sound that vanished from the world was laughter, for laughter belongs to children, and once the children were gone, silence spread like a hush across an entire species, a silence so profound that even the wind seemed hesitant to move through the streets of the cities, as though the very air feared it might disturb the fragile balance holding back the screams waiting beneath the surface of humanity’s collective grief.

 

Elena Roth stood in the center of her classroom, where dust floated through pale, slanting beams of afternoon light, each particle gliding in quiet spirals, like tiny spirits hovering over rows of small, empty desks whose bright nameplates still bore the letters of children who would never again raise their hands to ask questions about planets, or poems, or the meaning of peace, which now seemed a concept as distant and unreachable as any star in the cold night sky.

She let her fingertips drift across the smooth wood of a desk where Liam, the boy who once loved to recite facts about black holes, used to sit, and though she tried to keep her composure, she felt her breath stutter in her chest, as though her own body were rebelling against the notion of continuing to exist in a world stripped of laughter, stripped of future, stripped of reason itself.

On the whiteboard behind her, faint blue letters remained from the last lesson she ever taught, a lesson that read, *Peace is the strength of the future,* and with trembling fingers, she wiped those words away, smearing chalk dust into cloudy streaks, as if erasing not only the sentence but the very idea it once represented, because now, in the space left behind, the silence roared with a truth too enormous to bear, there was no future left to speak of.

 

Outside the window, the streets had become a theatre where grief and fury performed together in savage harmony, for Elena could hear, even through the glass, the thudding footsteps of men and women who ran through the avenues brandishing makeshift weapons and screaming slogans painted on tattered banners, slogans proclaiming *No Children, No Rules* and *They Took Our Future - We Take Everything,* words which, though crudely written, carried a certain logic that chilled her soul precisely because she understood it all too well.

 

When the Talisk virus first bloomed in the blood of Earth’s youngest, the experts assured the world it was temporary, a storm to be weathered, and that humanity’s reason would carry them through as it always had, but as weeks turned to months, and the hospitals fell silent, and morgues overflowed with tiny bodies draped in white sheets, a new kind of silence descended, heavy and final, the silence of a species realizing it had been severed from its own future.

 

Elena left the classroom, locking the door by habit, though in truth there was nothing left inside worth protecting, and as she stepped into the corridor, she passed two soldiers clad in black combat suits whose helmets gleamed like the faceless masks of executioners, men who nodded politely and murmured her name - “Evening, Ms. Roth” - in voices that seemed oddly gentle for hands that carried rifles marked with yellow warning symbols and green canisters labeled *EXPERIMENTAL,* as though even the instruments of violence had become mundane parts of daily life.Government posters had replaced the colorful school murals along the corridor walls, and their slogans burned into Elena’s eyes like acid: *No Future Means No Limits.* *Hurt Those Who Hurt Us.* *They Took Our Children. Take Everything.* Words that once would have seemed monstrous now passed as common wisdom, repeated by talk show hosts and senators and ordinary neighbors in grocery lines, because when the children were taken, the leash had burned away, and all that remained was a species standing at the edge of its own abyss, deciding whether to leap into darkness or pull itself back by sheer memory of who it once had been.

 

Stepping outside into air sharp with winter’s edge, Elena watched as a woman on the corner clawed at the robes of an alien shopkeeper whose scaled hands trembled while he tried to retreat behind his stall of spices and silks, but the woman screamed in his face, spittle flying, as she shouted, “Why should we be kind? They took our kids!” and the crowd stood by, silent and unblinking, as though kindness itself were an extinct language no longer worth speaking.

 

Elena felt a weight settle in her chest so heavy she could hardly draw a breath, for in the empty playgrounds, in the silent classrooms, in the vacant eyes of the people who once preached reason above all, she saw the terrifying truth that perhaps humanity’s peace had never been pure, but merely a fragile construct, held together by the soft laughter of children whose absence had become an endless echo reminding the world there was nothing left to protect, and no eyes left to judge what monsters they might become.

 

She closed her eyes, tasting the sting of tears on her tongue, and wondered - **if the purpose of peace was to preserve the future, then who were humans now that there was no future left to protect?**

 

 

 

And while Elena Roth stood on the cracked steps of a school where laughter used to echo like sunlight through leaves, in a cathedral only ten streets away, Father Marcus knelt upon the cold marble floor, his forehead pressed to the polished stone as though he believed that if he bowed deeply enough, if he surrendered every inch of himself to the silence between his whispered words, perhaps God might finally speak again and explain why a world so full of children’s voices had fallen into such perfect stillness.

The stained-glass windows cast fractured jewels of light across the pews, colors that once played upon the bright hair of laughing boys and girls who had run through the aisles during services, daring each other to race up the steps of the altar, while Marcus used to scold them with gentle words and a smile he could never quite suppress, because even then, he believed that the chaos of children was closer to the divine than any sermon he could preach.

Now, there were no children, only their parents, who came each day, some arriving with eyes swollen red from weeping, others stiff with a new and dangerous calm, all of them carrying grief so heavy it bent their shoulders and twisted their words into questions Marcus had no answers for, questions that fell like stones into the hush of the cathedral: *Why us, Father? Why did He let them die?* and *Is it a sin to want revenge?* and worst of all, *What is left for us to live for if there are no children left to save?*

 

Marcus would listen to them for hours, offering what comfort he could, his own voice softer and thinner than it had ever been, because he felt as though he were speaking through gauze, as though some essential part of him had been hollowed out and replaced with an echo of who he used to be, for he had never fathered children of his own, but he had known every child who knelt at his altar, he had blessed their small heads, taught them hymns, watched their eyes widen at the stories of loaves and fishes and miracles, and it was the memory of those wide eyes that kept him breathing now, kept him wearing the collar even as the world outside demanded that priests choose sides and speak with swords instead of scripture.

 

He had begun to notice a rhythm in the confessions, a new cycle of sin and sorrow that seemed to have replaced the old rituals: for people came into the confessional whispering of rage, of thoughts of violence against aliens whose faces they could no longer separate from the virus that stole their children, and then they wept, begging forgiveness for the hate that surged in their chests, and Marcus would murmur absolution, though his own hands trembled around the wooden lattice, because he understood how easy it would be to follow them into that darkness, how simple it would be to speak words of holy vengeance and wrap scripture around cruelty like a cloak.

 

Sometimes he dreamed he was standing in the cathedral, sunlight pouring through stained glass onto pews overflowing with children singing hymns, but in the dream, the hymn always twisted midway into a scream, and when he turned to the altar, he saw blood seeping down the cross, dripping onto marble steps, while unseen hands pounded on the church doors outside, demanding to be let in so they could carry out justice in God’s name.

 

Now, standing beneath the vaulted arches, Marcus stared at the statues of saints whose stone eyes seemed to judge him for his doubts, and though he whispered prayers for peace, he could feel the tide of the world shifting outside, a tide that pulled at even the faithful, and he wondered if there was any strength left in scripture to hold back a humanity freed from the one leash that had kept it gentle: the future it once dreamed of placing in the small hands of its children.

 

He looked out into the nave where a few parishioners sat, their faces pale and eyes hollow, and as he lifted his hand in blessing, he prayed not only for their souls but for the fragile memory of those bright young voices that once filled this place with laughter, voices that might be the only thing standing between the world and the monstrous freedom waiting to consume it.

 

 

And while Father Marcus lifted his trembling hand to bless a congregation drowning in grief, in a brightly lit studio washed in artificial blues and silvers, James Kellan, once hailed across the networks as the calmest voice on Earth, the man whose measured questions and even-tempered tone had soothed viewers through every crisis of the past two decades, adjusted the cuff of his immaculate suit, felt the weight of the small handgun hidden beneath his jacket, and stared into the red glow of the broadcast camera as though he were gazing directly into the soul of a species he no longer believed deserved salvation.

 

He had been a father once, not merely in the biological sense but in the daily acts of tying small shoelaces, wiping sticky fingers, listening to giggles echo through the living room where news scripts lay forgotten on his coffee table, and though he had spoken to presidents and kings and alien ambassadors with that same patient baritone, it was the voices of his four children that had always truly steadied him, for it was their laughter he carried like a shield against the darker thoughts that sometimes prowled the edges of his mind.

But then the Talisk virus came, silent as frost creeping across a windowpane, and one by one his children fell asleep and never opened their eyes again, and in the weeks that followed, James discovered how quickly grief could strip a man of mercy, how pain could become fuel, and how easily words - once tools of truth - could be forged into blades sharper than any knife.

 

So tonight, seated beneath the glow of studio lights that turned the sweat on his brow into tiny diamonds, James leaned toward the sleek, serpentine figure of his guest, an alien from the *Calari* species whose thin translucent skin pulsed gently with bioluminescent veins, and though the creature’s black eyes blinked with a strange, childlike sorrow, James smiled a practiced smile and asked in a voice smooth as silk:

“Tell me, Representative Vashtal - how does it feel to know that your kind murdered our children? Does it taste sweet on your tongue, this human sorrow?”

 

The alien tried to answer, its voice trembling through a translator box, saying words about sorrow and misunderstanding, about the virus not being an intentional weapon, but James cut in again, his words relentless as gunfire, each question crafted like a trap from which there could be no escape, for even silence would be interpreted as guilt, and each time the alien opened its mouth, James’s voice grew colder, sharper, until he was no longer asking questions but making declarations draped in the pretense of journalism:

“So you admit your species brought this plague.”

“So you admit our children died for your negligence.”

“So you believe humans should simply… forgive you?”

 

And in the control room behind the glass, producers and crew watched in breathless silence, none daring to intervene, because ratings had become a god that devoured morality, and this broadcast was drawing more viewers than any peace summit or scientific discovery ever had.

 

James leaned back in his chair, folding his hands in front of him, and for a moment, he almost looked as he once had - the nation’s voice of reason - but then he reached into his jacket, and before anyone in the studio could truly process what they were seeing, he drew a small matte-black pistol and aimed it directly at Vashtal’s chest.

The alien froze, luminous veins pulsing bright yellow in terror, as James spoke into the stunned hush, his voice calm and low:

“Justice,” he said, “must have a face. Tonight, I’m giving it mine.”

And he pulled the trigger.

 

The alien’s thin body jerked backward, a stain blossoming across its pale skin like spilled ink, and as crew members screamed and cameras fell from trembling hands, James Kellan stood slowly, placed the gun neatly on his desk, and stared into the nearest lens with eyes so flat and empty they seemed to reflect nothing at all.

 

He spoke once more, his voice barely above a whisper:

“They took our reason. I’m merely giving it back.”

 

Hours later, on other networks, talking heads debated the incident with a fervor that tasted almost like triumph, some praising James as a patriot who had avenged the world’s children, others wringing their hands and asking whether *perhaps* he’d gone too far, but the news tickers at the bottom of the screens all carried the same message:

**JUDGE RULES TV HOST ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE. NO CHARGES TO BE FILED.**

And somewhere in the darkness beyond the studio lights, humanity took another silent step away from the people they used to be.

 

 

And while James Kellan’s final broadcast replayed across every screen in neon-lit cities where crowds roared their approval or their horror, in a high-security research complex buried beneath the scarred crust of Nevada’s desert, Dr. Amara Velasquez stood in front of a sealed observation chamber, her gloved hands pressed against the glass, watching a swirling suspension of pale golden fluid in which thousands of viral particles danced and shivered like microscopic stars in a galaxy she herself had created, and though she once believed her entire purpose in life was to cure disease, she now found herself counting viral loads with the same reverence that a jeweler might reserve for diamonds.

 

Once, Amara Velasquez had been known across Earth as the woman who saved millions during the Sargasso Flu pandemic, her name printed on medals and laurelled plaques, her gentle face smiling from medical journals and international conferences where she spoke of ethics, of responsibility, of how science must always serve life rather than death, and she had meant every word with the fierce conviction of someone who believed knowledge was humanity’s highest calling, for in those years she could not imagine that one day she would stand here, engineering death so perfect it could silence entire planets.

 

Yet the Talisk virus had come like a thief in the night, slipping through biofilters, defying quarantines, creeping silently into nurseries and classrooms until the world’s children fell silent in their beds, and Amara, who had watched her niece and nephew fade beneath ventilators, their eyes closing in soft unknowing , discovered that grief could ignite a cold clarity sharper than any surgical blade, a clarity in which all previous rules seemed like paper burned to ash under a single, unanswerable truth: **If no one would protect humanity’s future, then humanity would become its own weapon.**

 

So when the generals came to her, wearing crisp uniforms and eyes darkened by sleepless nights, offering her a laboratory and unlimited funding and the gentle reassurance that her actions would save billions more lives than they would ever take, she did not refuse, because by then she no longer felt like the woman who once wept at patient bedsides or who spoke so fervently about the sanctity of life, but rather like someone reborn from fire and sorrow, willing to stain her hands red if it meant carving justice into the flesh of a galaxy that had stolen humanity’s children.

 

They called the new virus **L1L - Last 1 Laugh -** a name that both mocked and mirrored the cruelty of the Talisk plague, and Amara sometimes whispered it under her breath like a prayer as she adjusted microscopes, refined RNA sequences, and tested viral vectors against alien cell cultures grown in humming incubators, each experiment tightening the noose around future generations of species whose names she did not care to pronounce anymore, because in her mind, every alien face had begun to blur into a single mask of guilt.

 

Late at night, when the lab’s fluorescent lights hummed like distant insect wings, Amara would sit alone at her workbench, staring at the vials stacked in stainless steel trays, and she would remember the gentle laughter of her niece playing with building blocks, the way the child once said she wanted to become a doctor *“just like Auntie Amara,”* and sometimes her vision would swim with tears so thick she could not read the screens in front of her, and for a few fragile minutes, she would wonder whether the path she had chosen was not a doorway to justice but merely the first step toward becoming the very monster she once vowed to fight.

 

Yet each time she felt her resolve begin to crack, she would think of the empty cribs, of tiny graves lined up like silent accusations beneath the sky, of all the millions of children who would never be born to carry on humanity’s laughter, and she would tell herself that mercy was a luxury reserved for species that still had futures to protect, and that she was simply ensuring no other race would ever look upon humanity as prey again.

 

In the observation chamber, the swirling golden fluid seemed almost beautiful as it caught the sterile lab lights, and Dr. Amara Velasquez, once healer, now architect of extinction, whispered softly into the glass, her voice steady and cold:

“This is for the children. For every laugh that died in silence.”

 

And somewhere above the hidden corridors of the lab, Earth’s flags fluttered in dusty winds, emblazoned with a new motto that no one would have dared speak aloud seven hundred years ago:

“There is no eyes to judge us.”

 

And while Dr. Amara Velasquez stood in the silence of her lab contemplating the weight of glass vials that could extinguish worlds, in the vast square at the heart of Central City, beneath towers still bearing the scorch marks of riots and drone strikes, a great crowd gathered in the first gray hush of dawn, though no one among them came to celebrate the rising of the sun, for the morning had become an hour reserved not for light but for lamentation, an hour when the people of Earth gathered to remember the children whose laughter had vanished so utterly from the streets that even the pigeons seemed to coo in softer tones, as if the very birds feared to intrude upon the grief that hung over humanity like an unending winter sky.

 

The crowd stretched for blocks in every direction, a silent ocean of bowed heads and clenched fists, and though the screens along the buildings flickered with the images of politicians and soldiers, the people paid them little attention, for all eyes were drawn instead to the white marble statue at the center of the plaza, a monument newly erected in the likeness of a young girl holding a paper star in her outstretched hands, her stone eyes gazing skyward in a hope she would never live to see fulfilled.

 

And through this crowd there moved a figure unlike any other, a towering alien whose broad shoulders and ridged carapace gleamed a deep cerulean under the cold, shifting dawn, and whose luminous eyes seemed to flicker with pale fire each time he turned his head, for he was of the species known as the Therran, whom humans once welcomed as allies and friends, but who now found themselves hunted through streets, dragged from shops and trams and alleys by hands trembling with rage born of graves too small and too numerous to count.

 

As the Therran walked, a hush rippled around him, the sea of mourners parting not from respect but from revulsion and fury held in trembling check, for men and women spat curses beneath their breath, their eyes glittering with unshed tears and the longing for vengeance they dared not enact in that sacred hour of mourning, and some hurled words sharp as broken glass: *“Monster.”* *“Murderer.”* *“Your kind stole our babies.”*

But the Therran did not flinch, nor did he quicken his pace, for though he understood human language well enough to feel each insult strike his chest like a hammer blow, he also understood grief, a grief so vast it could sweep away entire histories of mercy, and he carried that knowledge with him as a kind of shield, refusing to yield to hatred because he knew that to surrender to hatred would mean surrendering the last fragile threads that held the galaxy together.

 

He reached the foot of the statue, his massive hands trembling as he knelt upon the frost-slick stones, and from beneath the folds of his dark ceremonial cloak he drew a bundle of pale blossoms, long white petals streaked with delicate veins of crimson, flowers sacred to his people, symbols of mourning and rebirth, and he laid them gently at the statue’s base, bowing his armored head until one curved horn scraped softly against the marble plinth.

 

Then, in a voice both resonant and strange, shaped by throat structures foreign to human ears, he began to pray aloud in the Therran tongue, each word a liquid cascade of consonants and fluted tones, a sound at once sorrowful and eerily beautiful, so that even those humans who moments before had hissed insults now fell silent, watching this creature pour out his grief not only for his own dead but for the children of Earth whose laughter would never again fill parks or classrooms or quiet homes at dusk.

 

Some humans shifted uncomfortably, glancing at one another as though seeking permission to remain, while others closed their eyes, their breath misting in the cold, until as the sun finally slipped behind a bank of iron-gray clouds, a single woman began to murmur a prayer of her own ,soft, almost hesitant , and then another joined her, and another, until voices rose all around the square, hundreds of prayers lifted skyward in dozens of human languages, each one different in sound and shape but identical in the aching, desperate cadence of loss.

 

For a few brief minutes, the plaza was filled not with slogans of vengeance nor shouts of blame but with the raw, trembling music of grief shared across species, a music woven from the knowledge that while the galaxy might be vast and cruel, sorrow was a language every creature understood, and though hatred might yet prevail, in that fragile dawn it was sorrow, not rage, that held dominion.

 

When the last human voices fell silent, the Therran remained kneeling, his head bowed, and though the eyes of the crowd still burned with suspicion, none stepped forward to harm him, for in that moment even the most furious among them seemed unsure whether to see him as an enemy or as another mourner kneeling before a shared grave.

 

And somewhere beyond the glow of the city’s trembling lights, the future, battered, uncertain, but not yet extinguished, waited to see whether humanity would remain a species of reason, or whether the silence left by their children’s laughter would echo forever as the sound of war.

 

And so the world spun onward, scarred and silent, caught between the memory of laughter and the taste of blood, while somewhere, in a language few could understand, an alien’s prayer still lingered in the cold morning air, a prayer that perhaps, despite all the darkness, there might remain one small reason to be human after all.",4,1751642833.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

1lrlf3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApproachingIRL/comments/1lrlf3c/bridging_conversations/,Bridging conversations,"I have heard from some people that the ideal setup of their approach is that they will compliment a girl and then ask her to be his gf, then wonder why they have done 100 approaches and not 1 number. 

  
The reason for this is that people do not want to date someone who they have no connection with, which makes perfect sense but to some guys they assume that they need to get something out of nothing. No one owes anyone anything and you will not get anything for just asking someone out. You need to build a little connection with them before asking them out. 

  
Now the issue here is that it can be hard to have a 2 minute conversation, especially if your social skills arent the best and you are scared of women and worry you will get arrested for talking to a random woman on the street. 



Worry not, most women are also shy and nervous, their social skills also may not be the best and dont worry you are not breaking the law by talking to a stranger(so long as you are respectful and not rude). 

  
That being said, I usually will find something on the girl that I can talk about, I learned to talk about almost anything and most girls are chatty. If you find something that they like they will talk to you for an eternity but the goal here is to have a quick 2 minute conversation, ask for a date/number then move on. Dont talk too long to a woman or else she will put you in the friendzone by accident. 

  
Here's an example:

Me: Excuse me did you get your stanly cup from Target?

Her: Yes! I had to wait in a line early in the morning to get it.

Me: oh wow it was defeintly work the wait and you also got a pretty good color. Is blue your faviorite color?

Her: Yes how did you know?

Me: Lucky guess lol(the cup was blue) I am guess you are a morning person?

Her: Yeah usually I like waking up early so I can start my day. 

Me: So you are a highly motivated and driven person, I am assuming you like coffee?(Most women that have a stanly like starbucks but then again most women like starbucks)

Her: I love coffee! 

Me: Seems like we have a lot in common, would you like to grab a coffee sometime?

Her: I would love to! 

Me: awesome, what is your phone number?

  
This process is pretty simple, I use it pretty often for a lot of approaches, I will use this for almost any situation. I've even done this with a woman who was wearing an arm cast. 

  
Its a pretty simple process, try not to memorize the lines and learn to do it on the fly but if you do need a lot more information, see a more detailed guide below of bridging conversation:

🔄 1. Use ""Associative Linking"" Find a small detail in the current topic and connect it to a new one. Example: Them: “I recently started learning how to cook more at home.” You: “That’s awesome. Cooking at home made me realize how much music I play in the background affects my vibe. Do you listen to anything when you cook?” ➡ You moved from food → music naturally by associating mood, environment, or habit. 



🔗 2. Use the ""Pull-Back and Pivot"" Technique Zoom out from the current topic to a broader theme, then move into something adjacent. Example: “It’s interesting how many people picked up new hobbies during the pandemic. What’s something you tried that surprised you?” ➡ This lets the conversation evolve without a jarring shift. 



💬 3. Ask a Reflective or Meta Question Instead of changing the topic, ask about the conversation itself or related preferences. Example: “You mentioned hiking — do you usually go solo or with friends?” Then: “Do you prefer cities or nature when you travel?” ➡ You expanded from an activity → to social style → to travel, all within their comfort zone. 



🧭 4. Use Transitional Phrases These little phrases signal a shift without sounding abrupt: • “That reminds me…” • “Speaking of…” • “On a slightly different note…” • “That’s interesting — it kind of makes me think about…” • “Not exactly the same, but it’s related…” They act like conversational on-ramps. 



🔍 5. Observe and Loop In Your Environment If you’re in person, use surroundings to steer things: “By the way, that mural near the café — ever seen it before? The art here is so weird, right?” Or online: “You mentioned you work remote — what’s your setup like? I’ve been trying to make mine less soul-sucking.” Bonus Tip: If you're not sure what to talk about next, use “open-ended prompts” related to feelings, stories, or preferences: • “What kind of stuff do you get nerdy about?” • “What’s something random that always makes you laugh?” • “Do you ever have those weeks where you want to drop off the grid?” Would you like a few sample dialogue flows where I show this in action?",2,1751642609.0,ApproachingIRL,0,1.0,False

Anyway, he messages me last week saying he has started playing golf and if I was interested - I've never done it but thought, this could be something we do instead of beers - he doesn't know I am on MJ and I wasn't planning on telling him right now, and I can enjoy the odd glass these days but I'm not supping 5 pints any time soon.

So today I'm thinking we were talking about doing some wild camping at some point in the future, maybe we could do a few mini hikes or something so I say we could do with a catch-up ""but I'm trying to avoid the pub these days"" and suggest doing some hikes and he's well up for it. I then tell him I've been trimming down so I can get back to running and that I've lost about 24 lbs. To which he replies:

""Me too, lost about the same. I'm on the injections""

Turns out I'm 7 weeks in, he's 6 weeks in!!!! He said its the best thing he's ever done - it's like a miracle drug. 

I don't really have much of a point here other than to say not everything needs to be based around food/drink, worrying about 'coming clean' is not worth the worry and far more people are considering or have positive views on ths medicine than you probably think.

1lrl7in,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1lrl7in/when_is_it_time_to_leave/,When is it time to leave ?,"I’ve been working in a cafe that’s inside of a hotel for about a year and half. My first cafe/barista job. When I started, the manager who hired me was amazing— he truly loves and understands coffee, great and teaching it to others, super organized, and knows how to manage people. He got burnt out and left mid January. Basically since he left things have tumbled downhill. We have had one other manager that was a total dumpster fire, and the manger we have now is mostly not as bad, but not nearly as good as the original. He has lots of managing experience, wants to help, but he comes from the bar industry and lacks passion or knowledge about coffee. He’s also failed to keep things organized and hold others accountable. 
I often feel like I’m pulling more than my fair share of weight at work. Often I’m doing the job of a supervisor without the pay. I am a closer and have to ask people to do things so that Im not left with it all at the end of the day, including my shift lead. My shift leads and others have a serious phone problem, and ignore side work during down time. The schedule comes out late. There’s no consequences to calling out at the last minute.
This week he showed up drunk 2 days in a row, and went home before the breakfast rush yesterday. Someone had called out, and someone was out of town with their shift uncovered, so me and one other had to run a coffee shop and breakfast service for a hotel at 90%. No one from upper management of F&B thanked or acknowledged it. Yesterday was kind of a breaking point for me.
My dilemma is should I stay or explore other options. The pay is okay but not amazing. The main thing keeping me there is that I’m able to work M-Th 9-5:30. The consistent schedule and “normal people” hours are the main thing keeping me there at this point. I feel like it will be hard to find hours that good anywhere else. There’s not much room for skill expansion or upward mobility. All of my coworkers I get along with, but only about half are good coworkers. A friend told me about a local cafe with an opening and I’m highly considering it after yesterday. Idk. Can people who have quit jobs chime in about what made them leave, how to do it, and how to know it’s time?",1,1751642099.0,barista,0,1.0,False

1lrl73c,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallfiberneuropathy/comments/1lrl73c/sfn_may_be_this_could_help/,SFN - May be this could help.,"I will be short. And whatever I tell you is for information purposes, and of course, as your Dr. before adding, or changing any medications.

I have gone through what you are going through now, and I am not in that place anymore. Please pay attention to the following. This is not specific medical advise, but sharing research information, they are all public and you can find the studies.

1) Find a Pain Management dr. who will agree to prescribe 10 mg Methadone 2 or 3 x daily or Tramadol 200 mg extended release once daily; explain that you need immediate pain control and don't plan on becoming addicted, you just want you life back, and while you have pain you are unable to do that, ask for a 1 month trial. There is a new pain medication called Journavx (suzetrigine). I have not tried it but it is a non-opiod pain killer. It is expensive since there is no generic, it is only brand name. In truth, you could also ask for stronger painkillers as a trial, such as MIRS (morphine 30mg twice daily)

2) Learn about intermittent fasting, and try to do a 36 hour fast with just water, coffee, broth; I think this was the beginning of a major change. (very important). The more times a week, month or even daily, that you can do this, it could have a major impact on the body. Read about it in connection so SFN. Intermittent fasting, 1 day yes, 1 day no, 36 hours yes, then no, be your judge.

3) The 1 medicine which seems to have done a great deal: Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) 200 mg once a day. You can ask PCP, rheumatologist, immunologist. It is an immunomodulator, not as strong as prednisone.

4) tart right away with the following vitamins:

a) L-Arginine 1000 mg (1 gram) twice daily (may be the most important), Read about it in connection so SFN.

b) NAC 600 milligrams (mg) capsule twice daily.

c) CoQ10 400 mg once daily.

d) alpha lipoic acid 600 mg once daily (very important).

e) agmatine 1 gram daily Read about it in connection so SFN.

f) may be you can add colostrum if you can, but all the other ones are much more important.

5) It is my knowledge that when the pain is bad, a hot bath for at least 10 minutes may significantly help, at least for a few hours after.

You can get all the above on Amazon.

Please, give it AT LEAST 3 months, don't stop before, don't judge before, don't ask yourself beforehand whether your are improving, and may be, don't even share this with others so as not to feel their judgement. But please go ahead and try. Everyone is encouraged to try.

Chapter 1 The Document Delivery

I was publicly criticized by my manager during the staff meeting.

He said someone had reported me for having a poor work attitude and demanded I explain myself immediately.

My face was plastered across the giant screen at the meeting like a public execution.

Just as I was spiraling into panic, our boss—Lucas Jackson—appeared on my camera feed. “What’s the issue? Let me hear it.”

…

“Dear residents, please be advised that due to a reported case of infectious disease in the community, the area is now under quarantine. Please remain calm. Property management will soon send staff to conduct door-to-door inspections. I repeat...”

I stood outside Lucas’s house, clenched my teeth, and rang the doorbell.

The door swung open. Lucas stood there in a bathrobe, looking as handsome as ever, but also visibly annoyed. “What is it now?”

I’d already disturbed his shower once when I came to deliver documents.

Now I was interrupting his bath time again.

I sneaked a glance at the bit of chest muscle peeking out from his robe. “Um... management said the community is under lockdown. No one is allowed in or out.”

Lucas raised an eyebrow. “So?”

I plastered on a smile. “So, Mr. Jackson, would it be alright if I… stayed at your place for a few days?”

This high-end community’s property management was ruthless. They said during the quarantine, visitors could only stay at the community hotel.

A hundred a night. No negotiations.

Lucas might be annoying, but next to that 100-dollar-a-night price tag, he suddenly seemed quite charming.

“No,” Lucas replied coldly and immediately tried to shut the door.

I grabbed the handle and shouted, “You can’t do this! I’ve dedicated myself to you and the company! You can’t just abandon me—”

Right then, an old lady walked by with her dog. She saw the scene and couldn’t help but chime in, “Young man, take some responsibility! Don’t be a scumbag!”

Through the narrow gap I was clinging to, I clearly saw Lucas’s face.Yeah, he's hot, but he looked pissed.

Perhaps unable to handle the moral judgment from his neighbor, Lucas finally let me in.

I sat on the couch in the living room while Lucas—now changed into casual clothes—sat across from me, radiating low-pressure vibes.

“You can stay,” he said, still not looking too pleased, “but not for free.”

He added, “Normally I have a maid come in daily to clean and cook. But now with the lockdown, she can’t get in. From now on, that’s your job.”

I nodded quickly. “Got it! No problem. Leave it to me!”

Lucas’s expression finally softened a bit.

I wasn’t exactly experienced with chores, but thankfully Lucas’s place was equipped with user-friendly tools, so nothing major went wrong.

Until—I stepped into the kitchen.

I’d only just graduated and usually ate at the company cafeteria. I hadn’t tried cooking on my own before.

But I was confident—it’s just cooking. Throw in some of this, add some of that, stir and fry. How hard could it be?

I spent two hours watching cooking videos online, pulled a dozen ingredients from the fridge, and got ready to show off my skills.

But the moment flames leapt from the stovetop, everything spiraled out of control.

In my panic, I accidentally turned up the heat. The oil in the pan flared up with a loud whoosh.

Just as I stood frozen in front of the flaming pan, unsure what to do, a strong hand wrapped around my waist and pulled me back.

It was Lucas.

I stared at his broad back, dazed.

He swiftly turned off the stove and covered the flaming pan with a lid.

Then he turned to look at me.

I’m doomed.

Jane from the secretarial team once got fired just for bringing him coffee with her left hand.

After that, everyone in that team kept their distance from Lucas, afraid of getting fired over the tiniest mistake.

No one wanted to take the job of delivering this document. It’d been passed around until it landed on me.

And now I’d nearly set his house on fire. I was definitely getting fired.

As I stood there on edge, Lucas finally spoke. “Are you hurt?”

I shook my head, feeling sorry.

He sighed. “Forget it. Just don’t let it happen again.”

I looked up, stunned.

That’s it? Just don’t let it happen again?

Lucas was being so forgiving! Not at all like the cold-hearted boss everyone made him out to be!

I was moved and guilty at the same time. “I’m sorry, Mr. Jackson. I’m just not very skilled yet. Let me try a few more times!”

He ignored me, shoved me out of the kitchen with a grim expression, and decided to cook himself.

Watching him roll up his sleeves, he looked so stoic and composed—I couldn’t help but sneak a few glances.

Even wearing an apron with a Tom and Jerry cartoon on it, Lucas still looked ridiculously attractive.

Thank goodness for Lucas. After everything I put him through, he still forgave me and let me eat his cooking.

He was a surprisingly good cook. I couldn’t resist getting a second helping. While eating, I gave him a thumbs-up. “You’re amazing!”

Lucas’s expression finally lightened a bit.

Though he still sounded annoyed. “Slow down. No one’s fighting you for it.”

From that point on, the kitchen was officially Lucas’s domain.

Three days flew by in a flash.

Today was our monthly staff meeting. Every department head had to give a report.

Since I couldn’t go to the office due to quarantine, I applied to attend the meeting via video call.

I was half-asleep, propping my chin up while listening to the VP’s opening remarks.

Usually, these meetings were just for upper management. They had nothing to do with me.

But when it came time for my manager, Tammy, to speak, she called me out by name!

Her sharp voice rang out. “Recently, someone reported that a staff member falsely claimed to be quarantined and applied to work from home. But in reality, that’s not true! It is extremely inappropriate and has set a bad example! Claire Spencer, explain yourself! Now!”

I looked up, stunned, and saw my sleepy face displayed on the big screen.

I jolted upright. “Madam Tammy, I—I didn’t lie… The place I’m in is definitely under quarantine…”

“Still trying to deny it?” Tammy snapped.

“I’ve already checked! The only neighborhood under quarantine these past two days is Silverwood Heights! Are you saying you live in Silverwood Heights? Our boss lives there. Are you saying you’re neighbors with Mr. Jackson?”

I was suddenly nervous, unsure how to defend myself.

I was just an ordinary office worker. Silverwood Heights was a well-known luxury neighborhood. If I were Tammy, I wouldn’t believe someone like me lived there either.

Tammy sneered. It seemed like the perfect time for her to dish out my punishment, but then she suddenly choked, sputtering and lost for words.

I froze too, staring blankly at the man who suddenly appeared on the screen.

Lucas stood there in his bathrobe, lazily leaning against my door. “Claire, where’s the underwear I left in the bathroom?” ",1,1751641943.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

1lrl39w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualIreland/comments/1lrl39w/starting_a_business/,Starting a business,"I'm just full of coffee and venting positive vibes here lol.

Basically after years and years of working for other people I've started the process of building my own IP and maybe launching my own business in the coming year. Whats amazed me so far is the amount of supports out there depending on what you're trying to do, like grants and funding, mentoring especially. 

I am not wealthy, I don't have a lot of seed money, so despite having loads of ideas I've missed opportunities in the past because I just couldn't/didn't get started. 

So I was talking about an idea recently and someone said oh you need to talk to this guy, and then this guy put me on to another guy at an enterprise board, then I'm talking to folks about startup funding, investigations, feasibility, a mentor, a program, a roadmap. 

Like its still all semi pipe-dream stuff at the moment, but from thinking this wasn't going to happen to a week of well connected business folks pointing me in a better direction I've got to head into the weekend with a lift in my step. 

I'd never really think of Ireland as full of opportunities, but maybe I'm wrong, maybe you just have to catch the right person at the right time, and maybe have a half decent idea. Interesting times ahead.

1lrl30p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lrl30p/explore_if_the_cuisinart_dcc3200c_coffee_maker_is/,Explore if the Cuisinart DCC-3200C Coffee Maker is worth it in this review!,"Cuisinart's DCC-3200C Coffee Maker has been my go-to appliance for the past month, and I feel like I’ve become somewhat of a morning barista! As someone who thrives on caffeine to jumpstart the day, I was eager to test out this programmable drip coffee machine. This sleek stainless steel beauty has a lot going for it, though it does come with a few quirks. If you're considering this coffee maker for your home or office, I’ve got all the details from its timer function to its reusable filter and everything in between.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right out of the box, this coffee machine gives off premium vibes with its stainless steel exterior. It’s not just good-looking; the material feels sturdy and doesn’t seem to scratch easily, which is a bonus in a kitchen that sees a lot of action. The dimensions—7.8 x 14 x 9 inches—mean it fits comfortably on most kitchen countertops without dominating the space. At 8.23 pounds, it’s solid without being a burden to move around if needed. 

While I couldn't help but admire its build, the attached cord felt a little shorter than expected. This wasn’t a deal-breaker but required some creative outlet placement in my kitchen. On the plus side, it looks fantastic next to other stainless steel appliances, effortlessly blending into modern or traditional kitchens.

**Programming and Features**  
What really caught my attention was the fully automatic programmable feature. I can’t count how many times I’ve enjoyed waking up to a freshly brewed pot of coffee thanks to its built-in timer. With simple button controls, setting it up was a breeze—even for someone as technologically challenged as my dad. The coffee maker’s permanent filter is a standout feature, not only environmentally friendly but also incredibly convenient—you won’t need to stock up on paper filters again. Reusable filters, in my experience, often compromise on taste, but this one preserved the full-bodied richness of my coffee. Huge win for me!  

**Want the Cuisinart DCC-3200C? [Check Cuisinart DCC-3200C price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b073p6k4kn/)**  

**Performance and Brewing Output**  
Talk about efficiency! The coffee maker brews seamlessly, delivering up to 14 cups in one go, which is perfect for hosting brunches or powering through deadline days. I tested it for smaller servings and found it just as effective—nothing watered down or flavorless. Its programmable strength control lets you toggle between regular and bold settings, and my bold-loving coworkers appreciated this customization during our office coffee breaks.  

However, I did notice the machine isn’t extremely fast when filling up the carafe entirely (14 cups). For solo users, this delay might not matter, but hosting impatient guests? Eh, better keep them occupied in the meantime with some breakfast pastries.

**Advantages**  
This coffee maker has so many upsides, and here are the highlights:  
- Sleek stainless steel finish for a modern kitchen aesthetic.  
- Permanent filter eliminates ongoing paper filter costs.  
- Fully programmable with timer and brewing strength control.  
- Large 14-cup capacity is ideal for gatherings or heavy coffee drinkers.  

**Operation and Usability**  
Using this product felt intuitive from day one. The large buttons are clearly labeled, making it easy for anyone to figure out. My niece even gave it a try during her weekend visit and managed to make a flawless pot of coffee—her first time ever using a coffee maker! The LCD screen is functional, though I wouldn’t exactly call it high-definition.  

One thing that slightly irked me was the water reservoir—a little tricky to fill without spilling, especially in the groggy pre-caffeine hours. A better-positioned filling hole would’ve been a welcome upgrade to smooth out the process.

**Negatives**  
Despite its numerous positives, there are a few areas for improvement:  
- Water reservoir can be awkward to fill.  
- Full 14-cup brewing takes longer than expected.  
- Cord length limits placement flexibility in some kitchens.  

**Competing Products**  
In terms of competition, this model stands strong against some of the mid-range coffee makers like the Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed System and the Breville Precision Brewer. While Ninja’s versatility in handling cold brewing might tempt some, the Cuisinart holds its own in simplicity and user-friendliness. The Breville, on the other hand, offers precision temperature control, though it comes at a much steeper price point. The bold strength option on the Cuisinart is a feature that neither rival offers at this price range, making it a fantastic choice for bold coffee enthusiasts.  

**Quality for Price**  
Considering the features packed into this machine, I think it offers excellent quality for its price. The programmable setup, bold/regular strength toggle, permanent filter, and beautiful design all offer fantastic value for money. You’re investing in something that doesn't just make coffee, but makes coffee the way you actually like it.

I love to go out to clubs and bars and be social with my friends in that way. But being fully sober is so hard in those environments, and I’ve done it for a month+ before, but I don’t want to! Sometimes, I have a couple drinks and feel fine the next day GI wise. Other times, it definitely flares me, but after a day or two I feel normalized again so I tell myself it’s fine because it doesn’t last. But I feel like i might not be taking my disease seriously enough. For context I have relatively mild symptoms and inflammation from what I can gather but it’s always hard to tell who has mild or severe or if it’s changed. Most days I literally only poop once, in the morning, and that’s it. If I’ve had drinks, it’s usually just less formed and maybe I go twice and feel more bloated/inflamed in my abdomen and some mild discomfort, but nothing debilitating or that different from a normal hangover. I’ve made some dietary changes and I try to be aware of fiber and food quality and nutrients etc, but I’ve loved cooking my whole life so cutting out everything and doing CDED would suck. I already cut out gluten, sub soy/oat for regular milk, take supplements, try to do everything to manage my stress and mindset. But going out during the summer and having a couple drinks with friends feels so rewarding and celebratory to me, it’s so hard to put down. I’m tempted to just go back to smoking weed instead of drinking bc a lot of ppl seem to have better results that way, but I’m just 6 months sober from weed today(!!!!!) and don’t want to slip back into daily use. 

It’s not just about alcohol, but things like coffee too. I LOVE coffee, and decaf is better than caff, but it’s like Russian roulette; sometimes I have a coffee and nothing happens, other times it totally fucks me, and that makes me feel like those indulgences that other ppl don’t even think about are off the table for me and to indulge would be causing permanent damage that could lead to far worse outcomes. 

I see a lot of ppl with crohns who are sober, on super restrictive diets, and I commend you but it feels like such a restricted life to me. Should I just resign to the fact that I have to do that? Am I being stupid?",2,1751641748.0,CrohnsDisease,3,1.0,False

For the next 3 or 4 hours we exchanged pictures, text messages, screenshots, timelines. Brad and Jack had met through a game and become long distance lovers. Brad had excplicitly came to this city three years ago to see his boyfriend. Then a few months before his move, he met me. That's when Jack's DMs start to try up and mine become filled with ""good moring my love""s from Brad. He had been sending both of us exact same texts, the same cheesy reels, same selfies, same bullshit explanations when he failed to show up again. Jack thought Brad was keeping their relationship secret to protect him. He has by the way never once mentioned being queer to me, despite knowing that I am a bisexual woman. And he told Jack and everyone else that I was ""just a friend"" and later changed the narrative to ""a friend I had to cut off as she's obsessed with me although I told her time and time again that I didn't have feelings for her"". 



After all these Jack explained he had broken up with Brad. Because there was a third girl. Luna. The girl she was with on the other side of the door on the night when i begged him to let me in, according to Jack. Since Luna is an influential person in politics with a lot of money, Brad didn't even bother to hide it and ditched his boyfriend like it was nothing. But there is more. He owed Jack at least 2000 dollars because he had been helping him with his expenses. 



I felt sorry for Jack but oh my god was I relieved. Because that meant I wasn't the problem. Brad was a scammer and I had no money he could scam out of me. So he left. 



Jack and I thought about ways to inform Luna but we didn't know if she'd believe us. What if we told her everything and she still choose to believe Brad? From what Jack told, Brad was a dangerous person. It sent chills down my spine when he told me about the time Brad said ""I am going to make that girl pay."" when talking about me. He said ""Sometimes, Brad's eyes go completely black and he scares me. His eyes were black when he was talking about hurting you, Zen. Watch out.""



I thanked Jack for reaching out to me and laid this matter to rest for hopefully eternity. I didn't see Brad after this. I went on with my life. Continuing therapy and my guitar classes. Finding meaning and purpose in my newfound friendships. Decided to try dating again when an old one night stand hit me up one night. He was this tall, handsome man who I really liked but it hadn't worked back then. He said he wanted to get to know me better. I gave it a shot but he was incostistent with his texts so I immediately went back to my routine, completely ignoring romance for months. 



My friend group was honestly great. Lisa practically lived with River and I. I loved both of them very much and was geniunely happy they got along. River was also going through a major breakup during this time and we helped each other. We took one another on dates better than our exes did, shared late night conversations and lots of laughter. Lisa helped me dye my hair and I taught her about skincare. River was a very social kid too, he introduced me to his friends from our class who became our regular guests. Soon it was summer and our home was filled with friends, the dinners I hosted, parties we planned together. 



Before May ended, I got the news that Luna had found old text messages of Jack on Brad's phone. Brad sought asylum in the same lie. ""I was assaulted, Jack forced me"". Our Luna bought it at first, invited poor Jack home only to insult him and call him every name under the sun. Before Jack left, he gave her my name. She reached out, I showed her the receipts, and soon Brad's parents had to fly in to pick him up to take him away for good. Luna hasn't said anything since but Jack and I are atill friends.



On June 2 years ago I felt a bit lonely and decided to try my chance again with the one night stand guy. He invited me over. I couldn't help it, I liked him. Every obvious lie he fed me when I was on his bed gave me euphoria. ""I want to see the new season of Witcher with you"". ""I will buy your favorite wine next time you come over"". ""I think I'm falling for you Zen."" I knew that it was all the game this 29 year old fella had, and that he would never follow through with a word he said, but I liked fantasizing about it. After waiting for a text from him for another day, I texted my final words. ""I had feelings for you, but now I know nothing real happen between us. Good luck""



His reply came 2 months later. ""Life has been crazy"" Yeah dude, whose hasn't? ""I don't want to pressure you Zen, I know I'm late, but can we talk?"" Well thankfully I had accidentally had little much tequila on a night out with my hot guitar teacher Miles and kissed him 3 nights before this text. I looked at Miles who was sitting accross the table before texting back ""We've both made our choices"" and blocking him.



I saw him again on a rainy fall night on the first month of our relationship with Miles. I had to quickly buy something from the store so I told Miles to go ahead. As I walked out I saw a tall figure. I didn't look at him until we passed each other. Then I turned back to see him looking back at me. My heart started racing with the only thing in my mind being ""this is wrong"". As soon as he opened his mouth to speak I turned back quickly, only to see Miles standing there. He gave me a hug as the leaves fell with the gentle rain.



My friends loved Miles. I had explained to him that my friends were basically my world. That River had his moments and Lisa could speak without thinking sometimes but they were good people and they were my family. Miles loved them too and quickly became a part of our weekly hangouts. Before I could realize I was in a relationship with someone who turned out to be a very solid guy. He showed up with groceries whenever he visited,  helped me and my friends with any problems we had, helped me with everything when I wanted to make our old home look prettier, showed up to all my hospital visits, even my cat's vet appointments. He wasn't the lovey-dovey kind who would shower you in words of affection but he was the first and only person who showed up for me. My friends recognized this as well. They kept telling me that I looked much happier and that he was husband material. And although I started this relationship ready to bail out any second, I was falling for him more each passing day. 



The rest of the fall passed in a blur. We did many activites and bonded even more strongly with this friend group. I organized a halloween event, christmas, birthdays... After posting the pictures of my Christmas party, another friend from middle school, Reyna, texted me saying ""You look like you're having so much fun."" So I invited her over for my grand new year party. Reyna was a trans woman who came out to me first. The small town we're from is riddled with extremists so Reyna had never presented feminine. When she came, I lent her my outfits and gave her her first makeup look. Since our whole group is queer, she felt very safe and welcomed. She loved the life I had built here. I told her she has a home here should she ever need it. And she did need it. Going back to her hometown after graduation would be a death sentence for her. She needed someone to support her through her struggle to find a job and establish a life. I wanted to... But it was not my decision to make. Then, River popped the question. ""Reyna, what do you say you stay with us here for a few months?""



So now it was winter and we were three friends. Lisa, Reyna and River. I hid Reyna from his parents and if they found out, we'd both be literally dead but other than that everything was fine. Reyna did try to find a job during this time but she couldn't as this is a highly transphobic country. I didn't make much honestly but all I did was share my food with her anyways. That's all she needed until she made her escape. We spent hours preparing her statement for the immigration office, planning how she would go back home to steal her documentation, how we would finance the one way ticket, perfecting our plan. And it was spring again when we helped her finally escape this hellhole, to never look back.



During spring we went on our first vacation with Miles, River and 3 other friends. It was a camping trip that I organized. After we came back, River wanted to have a conversation with me. He told me he wanted Miles to come home 2 nights a week only, and not three as we initially agreed. Because he felt like he lived with 2 other people and not one when he saw Miles often. And no exceptions,no stoppin by for ten minutes. Check in at 11 p.m. and check out at 2 p.m.,he said. I agreed thinking maybe he is exhausted after hosting Reyna for 3 months in our home which is always crowded. I relayed the message to Miles. He didn't like the idea of me having such strict rules at my own home, but I assured him River meant no harm and he had promised he had no problems with Miles.



We followed this rule with extreme precision. After I came home, I would quickly grab my campchairs and take them outside in the building's yard so we could drink soda and chat about our days with Miles for a few minutes before he had to go home. Sometimes we would hang out around our workplace. And for months we made it work perfectly.



Summer a year ago was a both very anxious and exciting time for me. River, Lisa and I had all got accepted for internships abroad. I was so excited because I'd be the first person in my family to go abroad. But visas are a big problem here and they take a lot of time and money to apply. River and Lisa got their visas one by one and I was... Rejected. Well. Not a big deal. When your daddy isn't rich it's not likely you'll get approved anyway. I spent the next month rotting in my bed while Lisa and River once again flew abroad. But I didn't show my sadness until after they left. I didn't want it to shadow their celebration. When River hosted a celebration party, I showed up with drinks and a big smile. When Lisa cried on the phone about not having her laptop, I lent her mine without hesitaion so everything could be flawless for them. When they left, that's when I let it out.



For a long time I didn't do much else. Picked up extra shifts to make up for the dent visa applications put in my savings. Later those extra shifts came in really handy when I decided to save up for my first motorcycle. I picked up any work they would give me. By fall when Lisa and River returned, I had saved a quarter of what I needed. I was working so much that my friends started complaining I didn't spend time with them. But the reason they thought why was completely wrong. To them, I was spending all my free time with Miles. There was some truth to that, as my day started at 7 A.M. and ended at 11 P.M., rushing to school and to work, seeing the subway tunnels more than I did my cats, and Miles wrapped up work around the same time as me, picked me up, sat down with me for maybe 20 mins before heading home. My only free time was Sunday and I spent all my Sundays with Lisa. She and River never had to work as much as I did so no matter how much I explained, they thought I simply choose not to make time for them. They came off accusatory at times but I knew they only cared about our friendship and found it cute that they would complain about not spending more time together although all three of us were under the same roof practically every day.



That's when a manager told me she was looking for a cleaner for her AirBnB. Twice a week. Small apartment, very light work, takes 40 mins max. Paid more than my hourly rate. I jumped in immediately saying I'd do it. But then I realized hours clashed my uni class hours. Then I saw the location. Right next to Lisa's dorm. She had mentioned she was looking for a job near her. I texted her about the opportunity. Surprisingly, she told me she wasn't looking for a job right now. I was sure she had recently said the opposite, but I didn't think much of it and went on with my day. After work I was downtown attending a vintage festival. I saw a beautiful top Lisa would love and bought it as a gift, a few minutes after that I got a text from her saying she was at my apartment and she needed to talk. I thought something had happened so I dropped everything, took a cab and rushed home.



Lisa had been crying. ""I took the keys from River"" she said. ""How could you offer me a cleaning job? Do you see me beneath you? Because you're an all cool teacher who doesn't do manual work?"" She started to cry again. ""I am a LAW student, Zen. I DON'T PİCK PEOPLE'S RUBBERS OFF THE FLOOR"".



It took me a while but i thought I managed to convince her that none of that was true, that I was going to take that job for myself but I couldn't due to other priorities, that I didn't see cleaning work any less than teaching. We had a long emotional conversation where we both cried and it ended with her forgiving me.



After this incident everything was normal again, all three of us kept in touch with Reyna, I skipped some nights after work hangouts with Miles to attend nightly face time sessions with her. Kept hanging out with Lisa on Sundays.



But something shifted in the air. I couldn't put my finger on it at first. Sometimes I felt like everyone got silent when I entered the room. One night we were chilling in the living room with River and his friends. My payment was late so I wouldn't be able to buy another pack of cigarettes until tomorrow. I asked River for one. Not something I usually do. He lashed out at me in front of his friends. ""You can just buy your own pack Zen."" One of his friends came up to me to offer me a cigarette later. 



After a while I started to feel very heavy. Call it intuition or pattern recognition. I called Reyna. She does tarot readings. Asked if she could tell me why I'm feeling bad suddenly. She said:



""Soon, something shocking is going to happen. You'll be devastated at first. But I see you'll regain your strenght quickly and everything will be better for you from then on. ""



Shortly after that I messed up. River's schedule at work changed and he wasn't working Sundays anymore. He had mentioned it but I forgot about it entirely. Sundays are when Miles has the heaviest workload so I always invite him for dinner while River's at work and he leaves long before River returns. Of course River knows about this arrangement, he assured me he definitely didn't care if Miles was home when he was at work. I was plating dinner in the kitchen that night when River entered. I didn't hear as i had my headphones on. He came into the kitchen with a death stare. I stuttered as if I'd been caught red handed. ""Sorry, forgot about the schedule change, Miles is going to leave in a few minutes"". He said ""No problem"" and i served him a plate. He basically inhaled the food and left, he apparently had plans. Then Miles came and told me what had happened when I was in the kitchen. He was also surprised to see River, said ""Sorry! Hi, welcome"". River gave him the same death stare and walked into the kitchen without saying a word back to him. I desperately tried to defend River, terrified of being stuck between my friends who I considered family and my boyfriend. ""Maybe he didn't hear you?"" ""Maybe he was just tired?"" Miles decided to text River. 

M: Hi River, I was just wondering if there was a problem. You didn't say anything when I said hi. Have I done something to upset you?



R: Yes you have. Tell Zen I don't want to keep seeing you at hours you're not supposed to be home. 



M: Keep seeing me? You realize this is the first time this has happened, right? Zen and I are going above and beyond to follow your rules. We have both been very respectful and careful so we wouldn't disturb you. I don't think it would hurt you to at least say hi back and overlook honest mistakes. 



R: I don't have to overlook anything and I am definitely not obligated to say hi back to you. 



M: Jesus dude, okay, whatever you say.



I was present when this conversation happened and I couldn't say anything. I asked Miles to take me to his place. I cried until the morning. I kept repeating ""this is not fair"". After everything I had done, on the first ever of simplest of mistakes in our entire friendship, this is the treatment I get? It had to be something else. Why would he shift his behavior so suddenly? The same guy who swore up and down that he had no problems with Miles. The one who shared 2 years under the same roof with me. I couldn't stop my thoughts racing. Maybe the paranoia I thought I had left behind came creeping back, but between a hundred voices, only one answered all the ""why""s. 



He was never my friend to begin with.



That night I made the decision to move out.



For a week, I searched apartments. The housing market had skyrocketed in the last two years, making it impossible for me to get a place on my own. But after all the bullshit I've been through with all my housing situations so far, I didn't want to try my luck with someone new. Then Miles said we could get a place together and I immediately accepted. 



In those seven days I had a lot of time to reflect. Where have I gone wrong... I knew I always went above and beyond for the people I loved. For two years, I took everything upon myself. I cleaned when River wouldn't. I didn't utter a word when he ate all my food, making me come home to an empty fridge. Even during our vacation Miles and I paid for most of his expenses because he hadn't saved enough. I stood outside my own home just so I could have a tea with my boyfriend... Then it hit me. I had really never said a thing. Maybe River just didn't realize how much effort I put in for our friendship because I have always been so silent about it. By the end of the week I had decided that it was not worth ending our friendship over this... But more importantly, I noticed something far more dangerous. River was trying to be clever putting words into my mouth by claiming he had seen Miles countless times in our apartment, very geniusly documenting it with a text. If I never confronted him, it would make me look guilty. Why was I afraid? He should be. 





That night, I asked him to come to the kitchen for a chat and gave him a heartfelt speech about how much I cared about him. ""You don't have to say hi to Miles, not even me"" I said. He said ""You crossed my boundaries"". ""And you don't have to extend your boundaries to my comfort, I thought we had established that."" I continued. ""But even with the greatest of efforts, mistakes happen. Speaking of, do you know how thin I spread myself, how much I try for us?"" I explained everything I had done and added ""You know River, the two day agreement was not something a flatmate would accept. It doesn't make sense to get into so much trouble to see your partner while paying rent. I accepted it without hesitation because I cared about you and I thought you deserved to feel at peace at home. Not because I was obligated to."" He didn't say anything. So I ended up by saying ""I am not asking you to change your boundaries, I am asking you to have compassion and empathy for your friend. I don't want to walk on eggshels in my own home."" 



So far you've read the story of many names, Nora, Brad, Lisa, River... And in this story, this is the first time I stood up for myself. The first time I didn't run away in shame as if I had done something wrong. I spoke gentler than I should have, but this was the best I could muster up at that time. And everything was solved after that. I never had any problems with anyone.



Until 2 weeks later when River officially kicked me out mid December.



""Zen, I swear I've got no problems with you. It's just that I'm used to living alone and I only took you in because I couldn't afford my rent. You know... Daddy sends me more money now. I see no point in keeping another tenant now.""

......



A week before this, one of my shifts got cancelled at work so I had all afternoon to myself first time in ages. I thought I should invite Lisa for a coffee but my phone was dead. So I kept walking home, planning our hangout on the way. To my surprise, Lisa was already there. Along with her boyfriend. I gave her a hug and told her about how I had just been thinking about her. She said ""Oh! Nice..."" Asked her if she had a plan. She and River exchanged glances and she said ""we'll see.."". I said ""well if you don't have a plan, we could hang out. Work got cancelled. I'll just go take a nap now so let me know, okay?"" When I woke up 2 hours later, the apartment was empty. Checked my phone only to see Lisa's story. She, her bf and River all out together. 



......



So when River gave me his nonsense speech about how everything was still fine between us, I only had one question in my mind. ""Did the girls know?"". He stopped for a minute before saying ""Yes, they have known for a month now"". Remember the ""prophecy"" of fake ass psychic Reyna? It all made sense now. River gave me a month to leave.



After big struggles, using up all my motorcycle savings, a loan from work, help of my dad and Miles we managed to put enough together to rent an apartment. I was out in less than a month. I couldn't bear to look River in the face without my stomach getting all twisted. The whole process was hell. The stress of trying to a decent home in this economy with my budget probably shaved some years off my life. I cried every night. The girls never called. Not once. I finally found a good home in an even better neighborhood. I really thought Lisa would eventually call. I waited. Nothing. She didn't even care what happened to me. How would I afford rent? Did I want to live with Miles or was I just forced to? How did I feel? She didn't care. So I cut off everyone involved.





Reyna, my friend of 10 years, the girl who got her first makeup look from me, who ate my food, slept on my bed, who was now building her new life somewhere i couldn't even go with an internship thanks to me.



Lisa, my friend of 4 years, the girl who always had a home without paying a day's rent, the one who cried on my shoulder, the one who tried to belittle me shortly after she came back from her much prestigious internship saying my google sheets knowledge was basic, but i could check my laptop if i wanted to see her work.



Two people  I introduced to River.



They bought whatever bullshit he made up about me. Without ever asking for my side of things. Not even stopping to think if he could be lying.



I thought a lot about why this would happen and the conclusion is still the same. They have never been my friends. All using me for whatever they could. And all have discarded me when I was no longer of use. When I made the single point that what they were doing to me was, in fact, unfair, they knew I wasn't worth the hassle anymore. And I have made my peace with that.



And that, my friends, brings us to today. 6 months after my move. Miles and I are going strong. My new home is everything I have dreamed of and the price was a steal compared to the rest of the neighborhood. My cats have been extremely happy with the change, they stopped fighting and peeing everywhere and they love this new home. Miles and I play songs, cook, go to the gym together. I have only one friend left in the city, the girl from high school but she's more than enough. I am geniunely happy now. I've been for a while. And this is why I am writing all this.



All these betrayals, heartbreaks and disappointments have been a big part of me in my early 20's. I'm turning 25 in 6 months and I want to leave everything here behind me so I can move forward. I am putting the memories, the scars, the bitter and the sweet of these people to their final rest.



Thanks for reading my three whole years,

I've slowly been building my perfume collection again. My husband bought Ciara on whim because it was a patchouli which we both love and it was so inexpensive. I got him hooked on fragrance hunting after he really enjoyed some of the Creed and Valentino fragrances I bought him. lol

I feel like maybe a lot of us have tried the black opium lately perhaps with the free ulta samples.   
;P

These two together are really lovely if you like rich incense type fragrances. The Ciara seems to soften the sweetness of the YSL and the YSL elevates the Ciara. Sometimes drug store fragrances can have a bit of a flat note or come off to powdery to me. 

I was really surprised how much I liked the combo. ",1,1751641663.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

😍🦚🎉 **WHAT IS IN THE SALE Pt. 2!** 🎉🦚😍


As we clear out the workshop, we often come across some truly Hidden Gems and Rare & Coveted perfumes! Here are a selection of what you can find in the Special Gems that will be broken into 2 separate listings on Sunday. 
Quantities are very limited (some have only 2-3 bottles available). Most of these have our newer labels with artwork. Unlike almost all other items in the sale, these will all be sold at their regular prices, but because they are true collectors items and have ingredients that are no longer available, we hope they find their way to you before they are gone. ❤ 

**1891:** A delightful anachronism of French lavender buds, mandarin peel, lime leaves, bergamot, bay leaves, coriander, clove, nutmeg, ginger flower, pink pepper, elegant white carnations, heirloom tree rose, opium tar accord, and woody amber resin nestled in an embrace of precious oriental incense woods.

**Absinthe and Laudanum in the Afternoon:** An intemperate intoxication of galbanum, laudanum accord, tonka bean, vetivert root and narcotic wormwood swooning into an euphoric delirium of opium poppy, poet's jasmine, and french lavender.

**Apsara:** Dark purple hyacinth flowers and Darjeeling tea dance together in a sensually alluring spring pas de deux.

**Auguries of Innocence:** Summery white ambergris, fresh peaches and a diaphanous bouquet of early fall florals - sweet clematis accord; orange jessamine; choisya; and parijat; and pale cashmere foretelling of cool autumn nights.

**Baiser du Soleil:** Sun warmed black coconut and white musk with faint breezes of vanilla orchid, star jasmine, and white hyacinth.

**Black Magic Woman:** A sinfully decadent enchantment of devil's foodcake accord drizzled with dark caramel and sexy kiss of blackberry brandy and black plum incense on an irresistibly seductive bed of dark amber and sweet labdanum sprinkled with black rose petals.

**Bohemiens en Voyage:** Indian tobacco leaf, dried orris roots, freshly cut hay, sultry golden amber, rock rose, the subtle muskiness of sun warmed skin and buckskin suede, and a sweet kiss of wild sugar cane.

**Calaveras de Azucar:** Hauntingly sweet sugar skulls nestled against a backdrop of sugared white ambers.

**Caliph's Beloved:** To the traditional folk-magic base of musk, ambergris, coriander, cardamon, and carnation, we have added elements reputed to be particularly enticing to lovers (new or existing) - almond blossom, Madagascar vanilla beans, galangal root, and a secret blend of aphrodisiac florals.

**Caravan:** A silk road intoxication of bourbon oak barrel cured cognac and rhodomel (flower) and melomel (fruit) meads infused with the sultry warmth of Ceylon cinnamon, cardamon, anise, and mace; caramelized sugar musk; Tonka beans lightly soaked in Turkish coffee; and ambrette seed musk.

**Come to My Silken Tent:** A deliciously accidental encounter of two our cult favorite perfumes - Come to Me and Silken Tent.

**Crown of Success:** For Success in all Endeavors - Aromatic Bay, Sweet Frankincense, &amp; Piquant Spices. Might not be suitable for people with sensitive skin.

**Deadly Nightshade:** The essence of dark feminine. Deep purple violets, dark leather, patchouli, black amber, and a narcotic swirl of opium.

**Douceur de Vivre:** An exquisite sweetness of Antillian sugar cane, flowering ginger, hibiscus, white amber, green fig, and the delicate essence of fresh coconut water kissed by a careless splash of white rum.

**Dusk in Autumn:** An inviting mystery of amberwood, Lapsang Souchong tea, salted cream caramel, and spiced teacakes.

**Succubus:** Midnight purple violets and a dark, compelling seduction of aphrodisiac resins followed by a sharp bite of spiced clove. May not be suitable for those with sensitive skin.

**Terrae:** An earthy, sexy, primally raw blend of exquisitely aged Indonesian patchouli and dark amber.

**Tuesday in Trieste:** The essence of a lazy summer afternoon idling at a piazza cafè - a sparking cocktail of prosecco and elderflower wine, fresh apricots, green fig, citrus, mandarins, and effervescent summer musks.

**Vanille Amour:** A beguilingly spicy, delightfully sexy blend of Madagascar and Tahitian vanillas and Tonka in with a warm melange of ancient Ottoman trade spices including cardamon, ginger, and Grains of Paradise.

1lrkw57,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lrkw57/from_unwanted_mate_to_lycan_queen_by_harper_lee/,From Unwanted Mate to Lycan Queen By Harper Lee,"After being rejected and cast aside by her mate, Kael Ardyn, the Alpha of the Shadow Fang Pack, Selene Veyra finds herself unwanted and discarded. Determined to survive on her own, she leaves the pack and discovers her true potential as a powerful Lycan. As fate intervenes, Selene rises from the ashes of her past to claim her destiny, becoming the Lycan Queen and proving that strength comes not from others' validation but from within.

# Chapter 1 - Reborn as the Lycan Heir

My body froze as the words slipped from Casen Harrison’s lips—Alpha of the Harrison Pack—spoken to his Beta, Flynn Riley. ""I was only using her. After all, only her mother’s kidney could save my true mate."" The air around me turned icy, and a sharp, searing pain tore through my chest. It was the mate bond, shattering into irreparable pieces.

""She’s nothing but an unwanted Omega,"" Casen sneered, his voice dripping with venom. ""How could a she-wolf of her status ever deserve my attention?"" His words were a blade, slicing through what little hope I had left. I wanted to scream, to demand answers, but my body betrayed me. He had consumed wolfbane juice—a deadly poison for werewolves—and my strength was fading fast.

How could you, Casen? I thought, my vision blurring. How could you betray the one who would have given everything to be your Luna? Do you truly believe the Moon Goddess would bless this deception?

Darkness crept into the edges of my consciousness, pulling me under.

If I were given another chance, I vowed silently, I would never trust Casen Harrison again—not the man I once dreamed of calling my mate, not the one I would have sacrificed everything for.

\---

My mother, Alisson Scott, lay in a hospital bed, her life hanging by the thinnest thread. The surgery she needed was expensive—impossibly so—and I was desperate to find a way to save her. Just as despair threatened to consume me, Casen appeared, offering the full amount. But his generosity came with a price: he wanted me to become his Luna.

The room was thick with tension, the pack members and hospital staff holding their breath, waiting for my answer. In another life, I would have said yes without hesitation, only to watch my mother die in a surgery Casen himself sabotaged. But this time, I knew better.

""No,"" I said, my voice steady despite the storm raging inside me. ""I won’t marry you.""

Casen’s eyes narrowed, his Alpha aura pressing down on me like a physical weight. ""Brielle,"" he said, his tone sharp, ""your mother’s life is at stake. Are you really going to be this stubborn?""

I met his gaze, refusing to back down. ""I’ll find another way.""

The murmurs around us grew louder, the pack members exchanging glances of disbelief. Flynn stepped forward, his voice laced with frustration. ""Brielle, think carefully. The Alpha is offering you a place by his side. This is an honor.""

""An honor I don’t want,"" I shot back, my voice cutting through the room.

Casen’s jaw tightened, but before he could respond, a nurse rushed in, her face pale. ""Alpha Harrison, the patient in the VIP room is asking for you.""

His expression shifted, a flicker of guilt crossing his features. He turned back to me, his voice softer now, almost pleading. ""Brielle, don’t make this harder than it needs to be. Your mother doesn’t have much time.""

""Then go,"" I said, my voice cold. ""Your patient needs you.""

He hesitated, his eyes searching mine for a moment before he turned and left, Flynn trailing behind him.

I didn’t wait. I followed silently, my wolf senses sharpening as I approached the VIP room. The door was slightly ajar, and through the crack, I saw Faith Garrett lying on the bed, her face as pale as the sheets. She was from a low-ranking pack, sponsored by Casen, and now she was his true mate.

""Casen,"" Faith whispered, her voice trembling. ""Let me go. My kidney failure will kill me soon anyway. Just let me die.""

Casen knelt beside her, his hand brushing her cheek. ""Faith, don’t say that. I’ve found a donor. You’re going to live.""

""For you, I’d spend the rest of my life with someone I don’t love,"" he added, his voice soft but filled with conviction.

Faith’s eyes filled with tears. ""No, don’t make such a sacrifice for me. I want you to be happy.""

""You are my happiness,"" Casen replied, his voice breaking. ""I won’t let you die.""

I felt my stomach churn, the bile rising in my throat. I lifted my phone and captured the scene, the evidence of their betrayal burning into my memory.

In another life, this would have shattered me. But now, I felt nothing but cold resolve. I turned away and called my grandfather, Ulises Scott, the Lycan King.

""I’m ready to acknowledge my heritage,"" I said, my voice steady. ""But on one condition—my mother gets the best cardiac surgery immediately. The lead surgeon and medical team must be top-tier.""

Ulises’s voice was filled with relief and joy. ""Of course, Brielle. I’ll arrange everything right away. I’m so glad you’ve come around.""

In a past life, if Casen hadn’t proposed under such conditions, I would have reached out to Ulises sooner. I was the illegitimate child of the Scott family, the sole heir to the Lycan lineage. After my father and his wife died in an accident, the Scott family had contacted me, asking me to return and take my place. I had refused, unwilling to acknowledge the family that had caused my mother so much pain.

But now, for her life, I had no choice but to compromise. In the previous life, Casen, as my mother’s surgeon, had orchestrated her death during the surgery. This time, with a different hospital and doctor, everything would be different.

I stood in the hallway, my phone still in hand, the weight of my decision pressing down on me. Casen’s voice echoed in my mind, his words from another life haunting me. ""I just want Faith to live. Besides, marrying someone like Brielle was already the end of my life.""

This time, I wouldn’t let him destroy me. I would save my mother, claim my birthright, and leave Casen and Faith to their twisted fate. The pack members around me whispered, their voices filled with judgment and pity, but I ignored them.

I had a plan, and nothing—not Casen, not Faith, not the entire Harrison Pack—would stop me.

# Chapter 2 - Fate’s Fracture: The Alpha’s Betrayal

Perhaps it was the promise he made to Faith Garrett, but Casen Harrison had been unusually attentive lately. Early that morning, he strode into the hospital room, his Alpha presence permeating the space like an oppressive cloud. His towering, muscular frame cast a shadow over me as he extended a small box.

""Brielle, I brought your favorite spiced honey cakes. Try one,"" he offered, his voice smooth yet laced with the unmistakable authority of an Alpha.

I didn’t bother looking up, continuing to pack Alisson Scott’s belongings with a detached tone. ""No thanks. I’ve already eaten.""

His brows knitted together, his Alpha aura thickening as if to force me into submission. ""What’s wrong? You’ve been distant with me these past few days.""

In the past, even the smallest gesture—like a bottle of sparkling water—would have thrilled me. My current indifference clearly unsettled him. To him, I was supposed to be the obedient Omega who hung on his every word.

""There’s nothing wrong. We’re just regular pack members; no need to be so close.""

That remark seemed to hit him like a punch. Though he’d always considered me a subordinate, hearing it from me was something he wasn’t prepared for.

""Stop it,"" he snapped, his Alpha tone sharp and commanding.

""I know you’re worried about your mom taking it out on me. Everyone knows you have feelings for me.""

I glanced up, giving him a look that bordered on mockery. ""Isn’t that the line you always use? You said we’re just ordinary pack members.""

To avoid any misunderstandings with Faith Garrett, he’d often clarified our relationship by emphasizing that we were only packmates.

His expression darkened as he recalled those conversations. Suddenly, he noticed the empty hospital bed and grabbed my arm, his grip like iron. ""Where’s your mom? Why isn’t she here?""

His hold hurt, but I didn’t pull away. ""I moved her to another hospital.""

""What?! Why didn’t you tell me? I’m her primary healer!""

""Where did you take her, Brielle?""

I met his gaze with a hint of sarcasm. ""Why are you so anxious?""

He hesitated, stammering, ""I’m just worried about her health. She’s like a mother to me. And I’m the best healer in the territory. How could you transfer her without my consent?""

His arguments grew more forceful, the last few words tinged with reproach.

As a child, his parents were often away on pack business, leaving him with a neglectful nanny. Starving, he’d visit our family coffee shop to scavenge leftovers. At eight, he looked no older than five. My mom, with her generous heart, took pity on him, contacting his parents about the nanny and bringing him to live with us. Without her, who knows if he’d have survived. Yet, despite that debt, he showed no mercy when it came to her.

He released my arm, his expression conflicted. ""Brielle, did you also... come back?""

I admitted it calmly, ""Yes. So there’s no need to pretend anymore, Alpha Harrison.""

His relief at my acknowledgment of reincarnation was palpable.

""Brielle, you know the last surgery was an accident,"" he insisted, his voice softening as if trying to coax me into submission. ""I’ll come up with a better plan this time. And honestly, who else around here has my skills?""

He reached for my hand, his eyes warm but calculating. ""We’ve been mated for so long. Haven’t I been good to you? Why don’t you trust me?""

He’d always played the role of the devoted mate but later refused intimacy, citing ""fear of cohabitation."" Secretly, he drugged me with wolfsbane-laced herbs and brought Faith Garrett into our pack territory while I was unconscious.

Those moments I vaguely stumbled upon were always dismissed as figments of my imagination. I even felt guilt for my own mental state because of it.

""Casen, have you ever loved me?""

I searched his eyes for any shred of sincerity.

Without hesitation, he replied, ""Of course.""

He’s an extraordinary actor, really. Wasted as a healer.

""Then what about the mystery meat in the fridge that was never eaten?""

His composure faltered, and he subconsciously clenched the hem of his shirt. I’d found it while cleaning the fridge, inside an ornate little box. The lid had a message written inside: \*To my dear baby.\*

I’d wanted to throw it away, but Casen slapped me and yelled hysterically, ""Don’t touch my things!""

It was the first time I’d seen him so furious. Later, I discreetly asked a healer from another pack about it. They informed me it was a piece of placenta. Its origin was clear.

I never imagined he’d be so brazen, keeping their deceased child at home.

""It’s just a piece of art that I, as a healer, appreciate,"" he said, pausing before softening his tone again. ""Let’s have our marking ceremony in a few days, okay? I know you’ve always wanted to be my Luna since you were little. Bring your mom back here. Don’t gamble with her health. You don’t have the funds to keep treating her.""

He seemed to think his statement was final, expecting me to comply. Just as I was about to refuse, a frail voice interrupted.

""Are you really getting mated, Casen?""

Faith Garrett.

She stood at the hospital room door, fragile, with desolate light in her eyes. Her vulnerability made Casen’s heart ache. He rushed over, concerned, ""Why are you here? Go back and rest.""

Faith’s tears streamed down her face. ""It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come. I just wanted to give you both my blessing.""

She spoke haltingly, her tone full of grievance and reluctance.

Casen became even more flustered. ""You know...""

Mindful of my presence, he left those last words unsaid. I couldn’t stand to witness this sickening scene any longer. Grabbing my packed things, I turned to leave. Casen caught my arm again, urgency in his voice, ""Let’s complete the mate bond tomorrow.""

""I’m not going.""

I shook off his hand.

""Be good. I’ll pick you up from your house tomorrow,"" he insisted with an air of Alpha authority.

Before I could respond, Faith ""conveniently"" fainted.

Casen cried out in surprise, calling for a nurse, and the room descended into chaos. Amidst the whirlwind, he didn’t spare me another glance. Only Faith, cradled in his arms, cast me a defiant smile.

# Chapter 3 - Bonds of Betrayal

Grandfather had arranged for Alisson Scott to be transferred to the Lycan King’s territory in New York, where the pack’s best healer would perform her surgery in two days. When I video-called her, she looked stronger than she had in weeks, and for the first time in what felt like an eternity, I could breathe. That night, I slept deeply, free from the nightmares that had haunted me in our past life, when I lost her to Casen’s betrayal. Back then, I’d been drowning in grief, relying on wolfsbane-laced sleeping potions just to close my eyes. Now, I woke up refreshed—until I found Casen’s face inches from mine.

I jolted upright, my heart racing. ""How did you get in here?""

He smirked, that infuriating Alpha confidence radiating from him. ""You gave me a key, remember?""

I clenched my fists. Of course, I remembered. I’d trusted him once, foolishly, blindly.

""Get up,"" he commanded, his tone sharp. ""We’re getting the mate bond license today, and then we’ll visit your mom. I’m worried about her.""

I glared at him, the disgust I felt bubbling to the surface. ""In our past life, you sabotaged her surgery so Faith could have her kidney, didn’t you?""

Casen’s face froze, but he quickly masked it with a wounded expression. ""Brielle, how could you think that of me? I love you. I would never hurt your mother.""

""Stop lying,"" I snapped. ""I heard everything—you and that rogue healer you paid off. You were willing to kill my mom for Faith.""

His expression shifted from feigned hurt to frustration, then finally to a cold sneer. ""Even if the surgery had worked, your mom wouldn’t have lived long. It was better for Faith to have the kidney. At least she could’ve had a future.""

Rage burned through me like wildfire. ""You heartless monster! Have you forgotten everything my mom did for you? She took you in when your own parents abandoned you!""

Casen’s eyes darkened, his Alpha aura thickening the air. ""And what about me? Without me, where would you be? Living in some run-down Omega den? I gave you everything!""

""I don’t want your \*everything\*!"" I shouted, tears stinging my eyes. ""I just want my mom alive! You’re a murderer!""

I moved to shove him out, but then I noticed Faith sitting on my living room couch, sipping coffee as if she owned the place. My fury exploded. ""Both of you, get out of my house!""

Faith set her cup down gently, her wide eyes brimming with fake tears. ""Brielle, please don’t fight with Casen because of me. I know I don’t deserve him...""

Casen stepped in front of her, his Alpha tone sharp and cutting. ""If you’re angry, take it out on me. Faith’s innocent. Stop bullying her!""

Faith peeked out from behind him, her lips curling into a smug smile when Casen wasn’t looking.

""I’m not bonding with you,"" I said coldly. ""Now get out.""

Faith rose, her voice trembling with feigned sincerity. ""Brielle, don’t be like this. I just wanted to see Casen happy. I heard your warning, and I’ve let go of him.""

I wanted to laugh. She was twisting the narrative again, painting herself as the victim. And Casen, as always, fell for it.

He turned on me, his Alpha aura suffocating. ""You warned Faith behind my back? How dare you!""

Before I could react, he shoved me hard. I stumbled backward, my head slamming into the wall where the calendar hung. Pain exploded through my skull, and when I touched the back of my head, my fingers came away wet with blood.

Casen’s eyes widened in panic. ""I didn’t mean to—""

I tried to reach for my phone to call for help, but my vision blurred, and I collapsed to the floor. ""Please... help me...""

Casen dropped to his knees, his hands hovering over me as he assessed the injury. For a moment, I thought I saw genuine fear in his eyes. But then Faith’s voice cut through the silence.

""Oh my, that’s a lot of blood,"" she said, her tone almost casual. ""Brielle’s the same blood type as me. If we take her to the hospital, maybe I could donate blood.""

Casen’s hands stilled. His gaze flickered between me and Faith, and I saw the moment his priorities shifted. The fear in his eyes was replaced by calculation.

""Brielle,"" he said slowly, his voice cold and detached, ""since you won’t let me take your mom’s kidney, I’ll take yours for Faith.""

He leaned closer, his Alpha tone leaving no room for argument. ""I let you live well last time. Now it’s your turn to repay me.""

# Chapter 4 - Shadows of Betrayal

Casen Harrison loomed above me, his imposing figure casting a shadow over my frail body. His face was a mix of regret, but his voice was ice-cold, the tone of an Alpha who had already made his decision.He wanted me dead........

1lrkvwi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lrkvwi,Esperimenti con l’Iced Coffee,"A seguito del post sul Cold Brew, che ero solito preparare fino ad ora, ho voluto indagare su altre possibilità. 
Sono incappato nel video di Lance Hedrick sull’Iced Coffee e l’ho preso come riferimento per questa ricetta. 

Preparazione

Dose 60gr di caffè su 1 litro d’acqua. Qui di classica dose da chemex. 
Ho usato un setting sul ZP6 pari a 3, leggermente più fine di quanto uso per il pour over. 

Invece di utilizzare 1 litro d’acqua però, ho diviso questo come contributo in 800gr d’acqua e 200gr di ghiaccio che ho subito inserito nel chemex. 

Quindi ho inserito i 60gr di caffè nel chemex, dopo aver bagnato la carta, e ho versato i primi 150gr di acqua (sugli 800 totali) per la fase di blooming durata circa 1 minuto. 

Quindi ho poi versato la parte rimanente d’acqua in due tempi. 
Alla fine quindi ho ottenuto 1 litro di chemex in cui il ghiaccio ha contribuito appunto al 20%. 
L’ho lasciato raffreddare e poi versato in una bottiglia e riposto in frigo per 8 ore. 
Questa mattina l’ho provato e l’ho trovato completamente diverso dal cold brew. 

Innanzitutto tutta la parte acida era rimasta quasi intatta e ho potuto apprezzare maggiormente tutta la componente aromatica. 
Non disdegno il cold brew, sia chiaro, ma le due preparazioni hanno portato a differenze molto diverse.

It all started with a **tiny sore on my lip**. I’m on **isotretinoin**, so I assumed it was just dryness or a crack. I didn’t bite it. It wasn’t bleeding. I just thought, “okay, probably just dry lips.” So I put on **coffee-flavored Vaseline** (lol mistake) and didn’t think much of it.

But then it didn’t go away.  
Instead, it turned into a **yellowish hard bump**, got crusty and painful, and then another small bump appeared. I started using **Polyfax**, **Somo gel**, **Enziclor**, whatever I could think of, nothing was really helping. It actually started to look worse.

Then came the **neck swelling**, **fever**, **chills**, and **throat pain**. I was shivering and couldn’t even speak properly. My doctor said it was **tonsillitis** and gave me antibiotics (**Clarithromycin**, **Denzen DS**, **Fexet**, **Betnesol**, etc). I thought okay — that explains the fever, maybe the sore is part of it.

But still — the sore wouldn’t go. Then another doctor saw it and said:

>

And now I’m spiraling.

I **don’t know how I got this virus**. I’ve never had anything like this. I don’t have genital symptoms. I feel disgusted and confused and scared. It just doesn’t make sense. Was it dormant in my body all along? Did I get it recently? Can I spread it? Will it keep coming back?

I’m scared it’s going to flare up **again someday like on my wedding day** or something important. What if it happens when I need to look and feel my best? It’s so unpredictable. I feel like I’ve lost control over my own body.

# What Actually Happened:

* I got a lip sore first (before any fever)
* Thought it was just dryness (I’m on isotretinoin)
* Then developed swollen glands, sore throat, fever
* Was diagnosed with tonsillitis and started antibiotics
* Sore got worse, second bump appeared

#⁤ Best auto Odor Eliminator‍ 2025: Breathe Easy Again!

The quest for ⁣a consistently‌ fresh and inviting car interior can often​ feel like an uphill battle.From lingering food ​smells to pet odors and the general mustiness that accumulates over time, ​a vehicleS interior can be a breeding⁤ ground for unwanted smells. An auto odor eliminator is a crucial product for maintaining a ‍pleasant and healthy driving habitat. This review focuses on identifying the best auto odor eliminators for 2025, ⁢considering factors like⁣ effectiveness, ease of use, safety, and⁢ overall value. Whether you're a daily commuter, a rideshare driver,‌ or simply​ someone who takes pride in their vehicle, finding the right‍ odor eliminator can make a ‍world of difference.

[[Explore Top Rated auto odor eliminator on Amazon.]](https://site.rediys.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=auto odor eliminator)

## key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of an⁤ auto odor eliminator hinges on ​several key features that dictate its ability to neutralize and eliminate unwanted smells. Chemical‌ composition, submission method, and the scope of its ‌action‍ are paramount in determining its overall success.

**Odor Neutralizing Technology:** The heart of any good odor eliminator lies in its ability to neutralize odors at their source, rather than simply masking them with a fragrance.Look for products that utilize ⁢advanced ‌odor-absorbing or chemical-neutralizing technologies, such as enzymatic formulas or activated charcoal, as these tend to be more effective and longer-lasting than simple air fresheners.A product that ‌relies on enzyme-based technology breaks down the molecular structure of the odor-causing compounds,rendering them odorless. Simultaneously occurring, activated charcoal acts as a sponge,‌ trapping and absorbing odor molecules. A superior‌ product will ​also be ⁣able to handle a broad range of smell intensities and types of ⁢odors.

**Application Method & Delivery System:**‍ The method by which the odor eliminator is applied⁢ is also critical. Some‍ products come in spray form, allowing for targeted application to specific areas or surfaces. Others are available as gel packs or⁤ hanging diffusers, which provide ‌a more consistent and passive release of the odor-eliminating agent.​ Ideally,⁣ the product should offer a delivery system ⁣that is easy to use and allows for ⁤precise ⁢control over the intensity ‌and​ duration of the treatment.

Gel-based products ​are suitable for⁤ constant release of fragrance, and aerosol sprays provide ​rapid applications. The best products often come in both ‍variants.

**Safety ⁣Profile & Air Quality Certifications:** Given that the product will be used in an enclosed space, safety is paramount. opt for odor eliminators that are formulated with non-toxic, biodegradable ⁢ingredients and are free from harsh chemicals, VOCs (volatile organic compounds), and othre​ potentially harmful substances.Look for products that have been tested and certified by reputable organizations, such as the EPA's Safer Choice program or similar air quality certifications, as these provide assurance that ⁢the product meets stringent safety and environmental standards.users with asthma or chemical sensitivities depend on certifications of ⁤safety. The safest products tend to carry these certifications prominently.**Longevity & Duration of Effect:** A good auto odor eliminator should provide‌ long-lasting odor control, reducing the⁤ need for frequent reapplication. Consider the⁤ product's claimed lifespan,and also user reviews and testimonials regarding its actual duration ⁤of effect. Some products may offer a sustained release of ​the odor-eliminating agent over several weeks or even months,while others may require more frequent treatments to ⁢maintain a fresh scent.

Longevity can be increased by⁤ using ‍multiple products together. Sprays can be used ⁣for quick smell removal, and then gels can maintain the fresh air.

## Core Benefits

Using a high-quality auto odor eliminator improves the overall driving experience in⁣ multiple ways. Not only does‍ it make⁢ the interior of the car more pleasant, but it can also contribute to the health​ and well-being of drivers and passengers.**Eliminates a Wide Range of Odors:** A superior auto odor eliminator targets⁢ and eliminates a broad spectrum⁢ of common vehicle⁢ odors,including those associated with stale food,pet hair,smoke,mildew,and general mustiness. By neutralizing these unpleasant smells at their source, it creates a fresher, ‍cleaner, and ⁤more inviting atmosphere inside the car. This is particularly valuable ⁤for ⁢those who frequently transport pets or food items in their vehicles or who live in humid climates.

For example, if you've spilled coffee or french fries in your car, a spray will greatly help the problem in tandem with sanitizing the area.

**Improves Air Quality and Reduces Allergens:** Beyond simply masking odors, some auto odor eliminators can actually improve air quality by reducing allergens‌ and other airborne contaminants. Products that contain activated carbon filters or enzymatic formulas can definitely help to trap and neutralize common allergens such as pollen, dust mites, and pet dander, making the car interior more agreeable for allergy sufferers. This also prevents smells from returning as it provides the car with ongoing protection.

For ⁤those dealing with seasonal allergies the difference in air quality can be significant.

**creates a More Pleasant and Relaxing⁢ Driving Environment:** A​ fresh ​and clean-smelling car⁤ interior contributes to a more positive and enjoyable driving experience. By eliminating unpleasant odors, the ‍odor‍ eliminator helps to create a more relaxing and comfortable environment, which can reduce stress⁣ and improve focus while driving. This is especially important for long commutes or road trips, where a pleasant ‌atmosphere can make a significant difference in overall driver ‌well-being.

Studies ⁣show that appealing smells improve driver focus and reduce fatigue.

 I am Yvonne, the product designer from Team OutIn here! I am thrilled to kick off this AMA and share our journey crafting easy-to-use, high-performance coffee tools for life on the go. We've poured our hearts into each product, combining thoughtful design, real-world testing, and a bit of fun adventure along the way. 

Our journey began with a simple frustration: why is it so hard to get good coffee when you’re not at home? We’re outdoor lovers, travelers, and remote workers, and we wanted real espresso, not compromises. So we built tools that could *travel well and brew better*.  Ask me anything about OutIn Nano, Fino, Claro, or anything coffee-related!

Starting with portable espresso gear- here’s what we’ve built so far:

* **OutIn Nano**:  Our OG portable espresso machine. 20-bar pressure, USB-C powered, compatible with ground coffee & pods. Small enough to throw in a backpack.
* **Fino Grinder**:  Compact, cordless, and crazy consistent. 38mm burrs, 28 grind settings, and a sleek design that actually fits in your hand.
* **Claro Scale**:  Smart, waterproof, and travel-ready. Brew modes for espresso and pour-over with precision down to 0.1g.

So, are you curious how we managed to pack 20-bar pressure and fast heating into the Nano? Wondering how the Fino holds up against other portable grinders? Maybe you’re trying to dial in your Nano + Claro combo for better flow control or just want to geek out about flavors, brew ratios, and travel coffee setups? We’re here for all of it. 

u/Substantial-Sir-4483 will be answering your questions.

 Ask away; I'm here for it until we wrap up today **at 1:00 a.m. EDT**. Looking forward to chatting!

And there are still plenty of ""AI Deniers"" out there.

**A sampling of prompts from this video:**

A corporate executive is standing in a generic office, and on the wall behind him is a framed picture of a stock image…of a generic ""teamwork"" stock type photo. This photo in the frame is a rowing team paddling in perfect sync, shot from above — the classic “teamwork” stock image used in countless corporate decks. He glances at it and says with a bit of nostalgia in his voice: ""We used this shot in every pitch deck for over a decade.""

A dramatic woman in her 30s, dressed in all black like she’s at a funeral in a cemetery. She wipes tears away with a tissue as she speaks. She says, choking up, “You gave us sunsets… handshakes… slow-motion coffee pours… I’ll never forget you.”

  
A modern graphic design studio filled with art prints, sketchpads, dual monitors, and houseplants. A confident tattooed hipster woman with a nose ring, dyed hair, and rolled-up sleeves sits at a desk surrounded by colorful mood boards. She leans back, smirks, and says: “AI is so overrated. Good luck replacing me!"" as she points to herself. Soft indie music playing in the background, natural window light, creative energy in the space. Tone: sarcastic confidence.

  
A creative director type — stylish, maybe late 30s or 40s, with a blazer over a T-shirt and slightly messy hair — sits casually in a modern agency lounge or studio. There’s creative clutter around: mood boards, coffee cups, lighting gear, maybe a vintage camera. Behind him, a large monitor plays generic B-roll in a loop: slow-motion cityscapes, diverse people walking, time-lapse clouds.  
He looks directly at the camera, smirks and snickers a little, and delivers the line with sincere-but-sarcastic respect.  Spoken line: ""So long, B-roll. You helped us impress some of our best clients.""

1lrklv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/1lrklv7/alright_attention_everyone_i_will_explain_how_i/,"Alright, attention everyone! I will explain how I solved my severe craniofacial hyperhidrosis with science 😎- with no side effect","Alright, I am a doctor but this is not a medical suggestion. Just my story and how I come to beat it. If you have any questions feel free DM me. 

So the story starts with me in high school. My mom has craniofacial hyperhidrosis and I started developing it or noticing it when I was in early high school. At that time it was only unbearable during summers where I would soak through my tshirt and start dripping from my face just by sitting. 

Then undergrad and med school came along. I was still managing it fine during the course and working in the operating room saved me during the summers. But there was still considerable sweating during surgeries. I was able to solve it with thick surgical caps. 

After I graduating, I started training as a surgeon. During the stressful times, my hyperhidrosis got even worse. After dripping onto a patient which caused an infection, I started wearing neck shields which worked very well in preventing. 

During this time, since it got worse, I started experimenting with salt based antiperspirants. Everything except Odaban didn’t really do anything. Odaban was great. It stopped my sweating. I would apply it at night. It burned so much at first but would get me through and help me. During surgeries, this was a miracle time for me. But the burning got through to me. I couldn’t apply it consistently and in stressful situations, i would still sweat dripping. 

Then I started investigating medications. I tried topical glycopyrolate. Worked well but I was scared of getting some in my eyes which would prevent me from operating. So I tried oxybutinin. It decreased my sweat by around 50% but the side effects were crazy. And it was hard to function with it. 

Now comes where I finally used my medical degree in solving this. I first thought alright. How can I calm down my sympathetic system. Now mind you, unlike other nerve endings of sympathetic nervous system, sweating is mediated by sympathetic nerves using parasympathetic nerve modulators, acetylcholine. So regular anti- sympathetic reagents like Beta blockers wouldn’t work. You would need a parasympathetic blocker. But this also increases sympathetic system due to unapposed nerve firing which increases sweating.

But I decided to try these. I tried beta blockers and propranolol. Didn’t really do much for me. 

Then I thought of how the body cools itself. There are four major ways. Conduction convection, radiation and ofc perspiration. Now regularly perspiration is the last line of defense. What the body normally does is it dilates the blood vessels in your skin and shunts the blood through it. Using conduction convection and radiation it cools the blood and sends it back to the body. Effectively cooling you. So I figured I need to modulate this mechanism which I thought was the main problem for us hyperhidrosis sufferers.

The way this is done is by the smooth muscles around the vessels and capillaries. I figured I could try an alpha receptor blocker. The sympathetic nervous system uses this receptor to squueze and close the vessels. I tried one and I could feel my sweat reduced by 50% and almost no side effect. I only felt a little jidderish when I drank coffee. 

Now with this good result, I wonder if instead of a receptor of the nervous system I used a drug that directly affected these smooth muscles in the vessels. 

And here comes my savior DILTIAZEM. What DILTIAZEM does is it decreases the influx of calcium into your smooth muscle and cardiac muscle cells which effectively relaxes them. And that’s why we use it for hypertension as well. 

I started using it at 30mg twice a day and increased the to 60mg twice a day. And oh my word. In the past, I would only sweat from my face and hair and neck and wouldn’t sweat from my armpits. My legs would never sweat and would always feel cold. Now I can feel minor sweat all over my body and almost a 95% reduction in my craniofacial sweating. I don’t feel as hot as before as well. And so far zero side effects. 

Oh!my!word!

My current thought is, is this how other people really feels all the time?

Now I go back to my operating without a hard surgical cap and neck guard. 

Cheers! Hope it helps someone.

1lrkllo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lrkllo/the_day_i_realized_my_life_was_a_lie_part_1/,The Day I Realized My Life Was A Lie- Part 1,"I have been wanting to write about the events that took place in my life following my move to a new city at 20. I finally sat down yesterday. Took me 7 hours to write what I could remember. This is a very long story so buckle up. I can't fit it into one post but I'll post the other parts soon.

This is a story about betrayal.

Back in 2022, I broke up with my highschool sweetheart of 7 years. It was an emotionally abusive relationship which I ended right after I was physically assaulted for the second time. It was the 2nd year of uni and for the first time in my adult life, I was a single woman. So of course my habits have changed, I started to go out more often and even went clubbing. Slept around, made new friends, got into small trouble here and there. But other than that, I believe I was quite the same. The reliable friend who will offer you good advice and a homemade meal when you need. What more is a 21 year old anyway? But according to the girl who lived with me -we wilI call her Nora here- I was much more than that. I would later find out about her giving my sister who was visiting me at the time a ""talk"" about my declining mental state and her concerns. But not before she gave me the ""talk"". She said ""Zen... Your entire family is very concerned about you. Your sister didn't actually come here to visit you, she came here to report to your parents and take you back to your hometown if needed. You're unstable, you don't come home, you're always with another guy and you are going crazy but you don't realize it. You think your parents approve of your lifestyle choices but in reality they're fighting because of you every single day. Your sister told me.""

My world obviously shattered. My family history with mental health is not great. My grandmother and brother both have bipolar and schizophrenia and showed similar behaviour without realizing it themselves. So I believed Nora and geniunely thought that I was going out of control but it was not obvious to me although I hurt those around me.

For the rest of her stay, my sister Clara became very distant towards me. She initially came to visit to party with me but on day 3 she stopped coming out with me. She even called me worriedly whenever I went out. One time it was 11 p.m. and I was on the third date with this sweet guy. When I didn't see her texts, she called me a dozen times and started crying when I finally picked up. I was geniunely confused because this is the same girl who made me repeat my crazy date stories for the fifth time. Then came Nora's talk and everything started to make sense. I had failed everyone that loved me.

That was until a few days later. I called my mom. Voice shaking I asked ""are you mad at me?"". She said ""No? Why would I be?"". I didn't want to say at first but when she pressed I told her about what Nora had told me. For a few seconds, mom couldn't even say a word. Then she said ""Zen... I hope this is all a joke. None of that is true. Either Clara or Nora made this all up."" Then I called my dad, the same answer. They both told me they'd tell me directly if they thought anything was off with me, but I had only ever made them proud and they loved hearing all about my life. And that someone here was lying BIG.

That night, I cornered my sister. Told her everyting. She was shocked to say the least, but what she told next was even more shocking. Nora had also talked to her and told her that my unstable behaviour was about to cost me my home. Nora was planning to leave with the third girl we shared the house with. Because ""what if someone followed me all the way from the club and harrassed them too"". and ""It was painful to see her dear friend losing her mind.""

At that moment everything became clear. Nora and the other girl were closer friends but at the time she was looking for a home, the other one preferred to stay in the dorm. So she reached out to me. The next year the other girl moved in with us and Nora realized something. Why have **ME** in the picture? She could make a bullshit excuse and kick me out, or just leave herself. But not without looking like the fucking victim, obviously.

My sister apologized to me before her stay ended. She went back home and I started to build my escape plan. I was a part time waitress and there was no way I could afford rent on my own. At the same time I was thinking of ways to confront her. I am not very good at that stuff. But I was running out of time as I knew she and the other girl were looking for a new home behind my back. Then something great happened. One day I was at a function with the people I met from my partying. And miraculously, I got offered a job. English teaching. Less tiring, more paying. I took it and started in a week. Then another night, I vented to one of my classmates who I was house sitting for. River, a gay guy a year younger than me. Turns out, he was also looking for a flatmate. The flat itself wasn't great but it was on a very good location with ridiculously cheap rent. It was settled right there and I began preparations to move out in 2 weeks. That was the moment I believed in karma. I felt as though everything was working in my favor.

And then, it happened.

**6th of February, 2023**

Kahramanmaraş earthquake which took hundreds of thousands of souls. According to official numbers its 53k but if you're from that area you know that this is not true. And I am one of those unfortunate beings who is from the South East.

I lost one of my besties from high school. My parents' home which they were tenants in was damaged but we didn't know how damaged. They were forced to vacate and would not be able to go in for another two months. Things seemed dark, a real estate crisis had emerged before people even had time to mourn their losses. Rents skyrocketed, my dad stayed in the hotel he was working in and I took my mom and sister in with the family cat until we figured out what to do. They were understandably traumatized. Textbook PTSD. You don't walk out of a 7.5 earthquake unschatched. Remember when I mentioned my family history with mental health? My mom is no exception. She had had it until control but with the incident, something broke in her. I don't want to go into details but it was a hard time for everyone involved which also later caused their ultimate seperation with dad.

The only thing that brought me peace during this time was Brad. Brad was a guy friend I had been pen pals with for a few months at the time. But pen pals turn into real friends and friends turn into lovers, I guess. By the time he moved into my city, we had a routine where we talked over 6 hours on the phone daily. For him, falling asleep and waking up to my voice was a MUST. He asked me about my day and actually listened. When I was sad, he played me songs on his guitar. When he heard about his grandpa's illness, he called me first. We kept talking about the activities we'd do when he arrived. And one day he finally said it. ""I have feelings for you Zen."" I told him they reciprocated but that i needed to know him better. Shortly after this conversation my life turned upside down with the series of events I've just described and shortly after that, Brad arrived.

Midst of my chaos I found him the perfect apartment. I knew the city like the back of my hand and being a tenant my entire life, I was basically an expert at this. This apartment was also right across my workplace and we were over the moon now that everything was falling into place for us. That sunday was my moving day and we planned how he would meet my mother and then help me. On friday I met his best friend in the city, Jack. They had met 3 years prior to Brad's moving when he first came to travel and fell in love with the city. They had never lost touch since. On friday I introduced him to my sister. Being a Taylor Swift fan she joked ""I guess you found your Joe Alwyn"".

Sunday rolled. I called Brad. No answer. Then I got a voice message. He was crying. ""Zen, I am not okay. I am so sorry that I can't be there with you."" The end. I called him, texted him, begged him to tell me what happened. He said he couldn't talk about it. At night as I was carrying empty boxes, he called but I couldn't answer.

The next evening, he showed up at my workplace. Looked like a mess. Like he had been drinking. I grabbed coffee for both of us and sat next to him. And then I saw it. A hickey on his neck. Unmistakable. I confronted him right away. He started to cry. Between his tears a said ""I was assaulted on Saturday night"".

I didn't press any further after that. Being an SA victim myself I don't take this topic lightly, noone should. I will always believe the victim. I felt ashamed that I jumped into conclusions. Told him I was sorry that happened to him. He said ""No, you couldn't have known. And I haven't been taking good care of you. You deserve better. Let me take you out on Valentine's"".

With that one sentence I felt like everything was OK again. Like I didn't avoid going home so I wouldn't have to be alone with mom. Like dad didn't cry on the phone last night because he was desperate and helpless. Like my new flatmate didn't spesifically say he didn't want to see my mom or sister when he came back from his Germany trip. For those 24 hours, I looked forward to Valentine's.

On Tuesday, I wore my only good dress. A short black dress with long sleeves, making me feel like Morticia Addams. My red lipstick. The puffy white scarf that I had been saving for a special occasion. I blushed whenever my students asked me if I had a date that night, that it was some lucky guy.

After work I stood at the door. Brad hadn't texted anything. I thought maybe he was stuck in the traffic somewhere. Maybe still trying to pick the best bouqet. I waited and waited. When I realized no one was coming, I headed to a bar to drink alone. At around midnight a text lit up my phone. ""Happy Valentine's"" from Brad.

I went home drunk. For a few nights after that I kept getting drunk. Brad texted me occasionally. I didn't reply. 2 weeks later on a Saturday night I saw an ad for a costume party. I needed a change of air so I went dressed as a greek goddess, my DIY costume from last halloween. I stuck around for an hour before I decided I was too hurt to be there. Then right as I was leaving, I saw Brad. He was with Jack. He came up to me and said we needed to talk. He was very drunk. He said he was sorry he kept messing up with me. He said his friends in the city needed him more than I did. I didn't reply and walked downstairs. He came after me. His blue eyes filled with tears. ""My grandpa is dying and I don't know what to do. I keep messing up."" I asked ""where are you going now?"" He answered ""Anya invited me to an after."" I frowned. ""Your EX FLING Anya?"" He must've got mad because he went on a rant about how jealous I was and that's why he wanted nothing to do with me. How Anya and Jack were ""his people"" and noone could get between them. That's where I started yelling. ""I was the one who put you to sleep on your worst nights, I was the one who helped you whenever you needed and I was the one you said you loved desperately. And ANYA is ""YOUR PEOPLE""? And I am NOT? Don't you see I need you and you're letting me down, Brad? I've had enough. He rambled some more bullshit about respecting each other's boundaries but I was already getting inside a cab.

If I had left it here I could have at least left with my dignity. But I couldn't. Nora's prophecy was really happening, I was actually losing myself for real this time. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't stop drinking. No matter what I did I couldn't stop the excruciating pain of being absolutely lonely and hopeless. It left me speechless, hopeless, like a thousand knives stabbing me every moment. I had never needed more closure. Never needed someone to not disappoint me more. So I did the only thing I could think of.

Next night I went to a bar to write him a letter. It was the bar he was supposed to take me one of those days but never did. Writing a letter that I will never send is a method I've used many times when I know I won't be getting closure. Try it, it really helps. But don't do what I did and combine it with lots of alcohol as I did that night. Especially when you're vulnerable. Because after a taking one good look at that letter, I firmly believed that he needed to see it. I know. I shouldn't have... Next thing I know, I was at his doorstep at midnight.

I rang the bell. No answer. I called him. To my surprise, he picked up. He didn't sound surprised. Or worried. Or sad. He sounded very hostile. Before I could say anything he jumped ""What you're doing right now is a big mistake, Zen. Turn your back and leave."" And he hung up. I left my letter at his doorstep and texted him to read it. He didn't respond. I walked away to cry my eyes out. Strong wind drying them. Oh no... Insides of my heart was about to be blown away by it. I came back, he hadn't picked up the papers and they were all over his yard now. I collected them in a hurry, stuffed them in my bag and left. I knew that would be the last time I'd see him.

But... It wasn't. He came to my workplace the next day. I thought he had come back for the letter. Why else would he? I still had my letter in my bag. Walked up to him to hand it to him. Right as I leaned to put it on his table, he put his hand up. Without looking up from his phone he said ""I don't want to talk."" I could only mutter ""the letter..."" he picked it up and left. The next day, he came by again. I didn't approach him. Neither did he. He chatted up my coworkers, students and boss while I avoided eye contact.

It took me a few days to realize what was actually happening. He literally wasn't coming for me. He had befriended people from my workplace. He came by every single day, completely ignoring my existence, talking to other people. Drinking free coffe by telling the barista he's my friend. When my boss realized he hadn't seen us talking to each other although Brad's here basically every day, he asked if we had broken up. We had never been officially together to begin with but the short answer was yes. My boss understood what was going on vaguely and told him to either pay for his fucking coffee or leave. He left to never come back.

When I decided to pull myself together, I quit alcohol for a good while, started therapy, I dyed my hair blonde, started taking guitar classes to heal. My mom left to live with my grandma and uncle while my sister went back to my dad's after confirming that the building was in good condition. I reached out to Laura from my high school. We had had a falling out a few years ago, but after losing our friend I thought there was no point holding onto childish stuff and made the first move. I was happy she agreed to meet and give it a chance.Thank god for that day because we reconnected, grieved and healed together. The initial scare with my new flatmate River didn't cause any further problems, he was helpful and understanding when my family had to stay a few extra days following his arrival, and we had a lot in common. He was a bit messier than me meaning I had to take up on majority of the chores but I didn't mind. He also ate all my food and smoked all my cigarettes. But I really don't mind. I grew up with a younger sister! Compared to my former flatmates, River was an angel. And my other friend Lisa got along really well with him. It was spring when everything started to feel not so painful anymore. And it was a month after the last time I saw Brad when I got a text from his friend Jack that read:

*""I need to tell you something important. Meet me at the Lotus cafe on Sunday.""*

When I arrived, Jack had this surprisingly warm smile on his face. He was nervous, but friendly. I offered to buy him bubble tea to break the ice. I didn't know what to expect because you know how men's friendships usually are. Their best friend can do the worst thing possible and they don't care. So why was he here today, seemingly siding with me?

He asked ""I need you to tell me what kind of relationship you had with Brad.""

I didn't understand at first. Maybe we were never official in those short 4 months, but we were obviously something. And his best friend didn't know? I explained it all to Jack. How it started and ended. Jack's expression changed from shocked, to disappointed, to thoughtful. He finally smiled and said:

*""I am his boyfriend of 3 years"".*",1,1751640586.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

1lrkjn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lrkjn0/is_the_zojirushi_micom_water_boiler_worth_the/,Is the Zojirushi Micom Water Boiler Worth the Hype for Your Kitchen?,"Zojirushi CD-WCC30 Micom Water Boiler has been a handy addition to my kitchen over the past few weeks. As someone who needs a constant supply of hot water for tea, coffee, and instant meals, I’ve put this product through its paces. Admittedly, I wasn’t expecting to use it as much as I have, but it’s proven itself useful almost daily. This 3.2-quart water boiler boasts an impressive array of features that stand out in comparison to other similar products, but as with anything, there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**

Its polished finish and compact dimensions (11.25""L x 8.25""W x 11.5""H) make it an attractive and space-saving option for most kitchens. The silver-dark brown color scheme is understated yet stylish enough to match a variety of kitchen decor. Weighing around 5 pounds, it’s not exactly portable but feels steady and robust on the countertop. The nonstick interior is a thoughtful touch, making it simple to clean out any mineral buildup from regular use. My only gripe? The cord could be a bit longer to allow more flexibility in placement.

**Performance Features**

With its microcomputerized temperature control and four keep-warm settings (160°F, 175°F, 195°F, and 208°F), this little boiler takes the guesswork out of providing water at just the right temperature. As someone who drinks a lot of green tea, which can be ruined by overly hot water, I appreciate the precision here. The actual water temperature is displayed in real time, and I find myself checking it more often than I care to admit, just out of curiosity.

[Check Zojirushi CD-WCC30 price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b01m04lr6p/)

**Energy-Saving and Timer Functions**

One of the features that genuinely surprised me is the energy-saving timer. You can set it for anywhere between 6 and 10 hours, depending on your needs. This is great for overnight use or for times when I know I’ll be out during the day but want hot water ready when I get back. It’s also got this neat quick-temp mode, which heats water directly to the desired warm setting without boiling it first—a big plus for when you’re in a hurry or using pre-filtered water. I’ve noticed this mode reduces both steam output and energy consumption, which is definitely a win for any eco-conscious user like myself.

**Assets**

- The micro computerized temperature control allows precise water heating.
- A quick-temp mode saves both time and energy.
- Nonstick interior makes cleaning effortless.
- Four keep-warm settings cater to diverse needs.
- Energy-saving timer adds convenience for flexible use.

**Areas for Improvement**

Despite all these benefits, there are a few shortcomings that caught my attention. 

- The cord length limits placement options significantly.
- It doesn’t have a fully silent boil option; the sound indicator can be mildly annoying during quieter times.
- The exterior can get fingerprints easily, requiring occasional polishing.

**Ease of Use**

The overall setup of the product is incredibly user-friendly. It’s as simple as filling the generously wide water tank, selecting the desired temperature, and letting the system take over. The one-touch electric dispensing system works like a charm, making it feel less fussy than a traditional kettle. If you’ve ever scalded yourself with a pouring spout, you’ll appreciate how much safer this method is when handling hot water. However, the sound indicator (used to alert for boiling or low water levels) is functional but slightly intrusive, especially early in the morning.

**Product Contenders**

Stacking it up against competing products like the Panasonic Electric Thermo Pot or the Tiger water boilers, what stands out for Zojirushi is its reliability. The quick-temp feature isn’t something you’ll see in many models, nor the ability to choose between four specific temperature settings. That being said, the Panasonic’s keep-warm capabilities and operational silence might offer competition in households prioritizing minimal noise. The Tiger model, on the other hand, falls short with fewer temperature options but comes with a slightly more compact design. Compared to these options, Zojirushi’s micom water boiler feels more refined in its overall user experience, albeit slightly pricier.

**Value for Money**

From my perspective, this water boiler strikes a decent balance between cost-effectiveness and premium features. While it is certainly more expensive than basic kettles on the market, the precision, energy-saving modes, and durability it offers are worth the investment—especially if you frequently use hot water at tailored temperatures for beverages or cooking. As someone who values reliability in kitchen appliances, I feel like this product truly earns its spot despite its few flaws.

Spiff glares at the camera in his signature death stare.



""Why do you people hate me? Are all humans sadists or is it just the freaks on the extranet? Screw this, let's just get going.""



Spiff gets started and goes into the game, exploring the main hub for a bit. He finds the board and decides to ignore the training system, having watched a few galatube videos beforehand, as evidenced by the accidentally opened browser tab in his monitor. Spiff notices this, grumbles and fixes his aspect ratio and re-checks his recording. He accusingly points a finger at the camera.



""Don't you judge me.""



Spiff gets back to it and explores the hub to see whats around him and encounters the display cases.



""Skull... Jaw... Spine.. Scapula? What's that? I know what a skull and spine are. Are these display cases for BONES!? Ew... I'm going to find bones lying around? I don't like that. Oohh… That looks nice! Is this like all the equipment I have access to? Fancy! Probably need to level up before I can get half of it though. Wots this then? 'Summoning Circle? Ouija Board? Voodoo doll? That sounds... ominous. Why do I not like that?""



Spiff trembles a bit and heads upstairs to see what's there.



""Hm... Some kind of activity area? Why the hell is this place so dimly lit!? I understand spooky game and all but this is a safe area! Why are there no LIGHTS?""



Spiff scoffs in annoyance and his eyes instantly go towards the Jenga tower in the corner.



""OOOHH I recognise this! Its that Jenga game thing. Gods I spent far too much time with that when I got the real one in my fan mail video. I should probably do another unboxing... The pile is getting a bit hefty...""



The screen changes to a still photo of Spiff's storage warehouse, getting frighteningly full of unopened boxes of varying sizes, unopened Amazon-Star boxes, Courier Packages and so many other things, even one HUGE box that comes with its own small forklift.



""You lot are insane. But anyway. Time to get to... Whatever this is I guess. Lets see... Singleplayer. Hmm... let's start with... 6 Tanglewood Drive. This should do. Its all that's available cause level one and all. I wasn't paying all that much attention but I at the very least know the basics. Find the ghost room with the EMF thingy, then... do other things with other devices. I guess. We will get there when we get there. Start.""



Spiff starts the game and loads up the first level on the lowest difficulty just to see what the game is about. Spiff starts and doesn't bother to do much about actually figuring out a few details and goes straight in. He picks up the flashlight, EMF Reader and UV light and heads into the building. He spends a good ten minutes wandering aimlessly switching between devices and turning his light on and off trying to figure out what the game even is.



""So damn dark! Light switches and - OH BUGGER! Why the dark?!""



Spiff turns far too many lights on, blowing a fuse and switching the house's power off. He has no idea what to do or how to do it and fumbles about in the dark for a bit longer. Eventually he gives up looking for the power and fumbling with light switches, he just carries on looking for the ghost. Eventually, entirely by accident he arrives at the Son's Room bathroom, where the sink is full of dirty water. Spiff only notices when he switches to his EMF reader by accident and it beeps at him.



""OH! It beeped! Does that mean it's in here? This thing is... doing something. Okay.""



The EMF reader keeps a solid 3.0 level while close to the sink. Spiff has no real idea of what to do so just drops the gear and heads back to the van to grab a few other things. He's so frustrated and busy complaining about the lack of direction he fails to notice a Ghost Event. The screen dims, the lights flash and Spiff is too busy grumbling to hear the sound of a whispered voice breathing in his ears.



""God damn silly.... The tutorial of this game didn't cover much. In fact I think it was bugged or something, I couldn't get past the EMF reader thingy so I had to quit. Silly devs! Anyway... So let's see... Notebook and thermometer. Bring those then. As far as I know I have to plop them on the ground and see what happens. Right.""



Spiff moves back in the house and back to the bathroom, getting lost on the way again, but eventually finds his way and plops the items on the floor.



""Okay... Now what? Do I wait or... What now?""



Spiff stands around, using various devices for a few minutes and gets nowhere fast. Eventually he just shrugs and returns to the van, grabbing the last items he has - the video camera and spirit box - then returns to the bathroom, still unaware of what to do. Spiff fumbles about for a bit until eventually a Ghost Event happens, and Spiff fails to notice but the EMF Reader spikes to 5.



""Oh! Oh it did a thing! See that it did a thingy! Okay uhm... What am I looking for here now... Oh yes the Journal thingy. Need to find... Evidence tab and… EMF Level 5. Right. What does that narrow it down to? Hmm.. Let's see. I have found no Ultraviolet. I was told if a door opens by itself you look at it. No Ultraviolet on it so... Cross that out...? I can! Okay. That leaves... Freezing temperatures. Okay...""



Spiff picks up the thermometer and holds it in the bathroom for a bit. The temperature doesn't go down below 0. It gets close but not enough. Spiff crosses out temperatures and then waits around for... something.



""Okay... Now what? Spirit Box thingy? Let's see.""



Spiff turns it on and immediately gets annoyed with the constant switching of radio signals.



""How do I work this thing again... Uhh… I'm missing something.""



Spiff returns to the truck, and only now does he actually notice the challenge board and objectives.



""OH BUGGER!!! Why did I not notice this... Am I THAT silly? Okay... The ghost's name is Bradley Watts... Responds to anyone? Okay. So presumably I need to say this ghost's name using the Spirit Box and something will happen? I think that's how you do it. Okay let's do that then.""



Spiff returns to the bathroom and picks up the Spirit Box.



""Okay uhm... What are the questions... Or is it just like, repeat the name? Uhm... Okay. Uhhh.. Bradley Watts, are you there?"" Spiff waits. ""Okay... Bradley Watts, are you there?""



The Spirit Box continues its cycle.



""Okay... Bradley Watts, how old are you? That seems a reasonable que-""



""STOP."" A loud, aggressive voice suddenly speaks out of the box.



Spiff visibly turns pale and almost jumps out of his seat.



""O...KAY THEN... That's... New... Spirit Box Confirmed I suppose. So that leaves Spirit, and Wraith next.""



Spiff scribbles the evidence and hastily exits back to the van. He then catches his breath in the van. His camera shows him visibly shaking, but not for long.



""Okay... So... Right. Uhm... I'm NOT scared. That was just odd. So... Confirmed. It's now between Wraith and Spirit. So... Ghost Writing. So the notebook thingy next. Let's do that then.""



Spiff fails to notice the activity monitor spiking suddenly as he exits the van and puts the notepad on the side of the basin.



""Okay uhm... Bradley Watts. Can you write in the book?"" Spiff sits quiet for a bit. ""Okay... Bradley, can you write something?""



A few moments of silence pass with nothing of note or interest and Spiff checks the last piece of evidence, then circles Wraith as his guess. It's the only thing left available so Spiff ends the mission there. He guessed correctly and got his first level up from the mission complete screen.



""FANTASTIC! I win! HA! What's this? No photo of ghost... No average sanity below 25%? Failed to detect a ghost with a motion sensor? No Bone Evidence... Bone evidence!? What bones? No photos of... Something. Okay... Apparently I missed a LOT of stuff. So... What do I have... You know what, I'll just do that one again. How do... AH! Higher difficulty level. Okay. Tanglewood Drive again. Let's see what this is like at the Intermediate level.""



The level begins and Spiff grabs the Flashlight, UV light and EMF Reader, then fumbles about with the doors. Eventually he returns to the objectives board.



""Right... Ghost name Jason Maudsley. That is a very odd name. Humans are silly. Responds to people who are alone. Okay. Sanity below 25%... okay. Detect sound with a parabolic microphone. Don't have one of those this early I think. Detects a presence with a motion sensor. Cant do any of those. Damn... Need to check the store thingy to buy new gear apparently. Right, let's get started...""



Spiff heads out into the house and starts looking around for the ghost room. He eventually finds it, and just as he enters the kids bedroom, the lights go out. The ghost blew the lights immediately.



""GODDAMMIT!!! Okay, if I remember correctly I need to find a circuit breaker or something. Where is it?""



Spiff fumbles about in the dark for a bit. Then almost jumps out of his chair with a most unmanly squeal. A Ghost Event hits, an unnatural voice takes a deep breath, exhaling right behind his ear.



""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT!? What was that!? There's nothing there! WHY IS THERE NOTHING THERE!? I hate this... It's still not as bad as Subnautica but it's getting pretty damn close.""



Spiff hastily retreats back into the van to collect himself and notices the activity spiking up to level 8 on the monitor.



""Okay... Try again.""



Spiff fumbles about in the dark for a bit longer before eventually finding the garage and also the circuit breaker. After turning it back on he takes a deep, nervous breath.



""Right... Powers back on. Seems okay. Let's see... EMF Reader... Here we go again.""



The EMF reader spikes up immediately and Spiffs face lights up then immediately gets annoyed.



""Oh come on Spiff..."" He says and slaps his face with his palm. ""Of course you are going to get Electromagnetic Field Readings near an electrical box you just switched on. Okay.... Lets see... Anything around here...""



Spiff face turns pale as a Ghost event hits. His screen flashes, his flashlight starts malfunctioning and he hears the sound of some creature or person gasping for breath near him, along with footsteps. Spiff's face visibly pales in terror and he tries to get away, only to notice the door has shut itself and he can't get out.



""NO NO NO GET OUT NO I WANT OUT!!!""



The Ghost Event doesn't last long and the door swings open moments later. The Ghost had also cut the power again, so Spiff fumbles with the power a bit more.



""Okay... So there's something there. Let's see... What about over here?""



The EMF Reader suddenly spikes to level 4 and Spiff's vision blurs, the ghost returns and Spiff can't do anything. He recoils from the sounds as a pair of horrible, malevolent putrid hands wrap around the screen and his character dies, failing the mission. He sees for a brief moment the afterworld and strange floors covered in some odd black or grey fleshy goop, some strange figures twitching in the background and is then brought back to the mission selection screen. Spiff remains in silence for a few more seconds. A knock at his office door literally scares him out of his chair and he flies up into the air and onto the ceiling.



Mini-Monk wanders in and looks around to find her dad, sees nothing, shrugs her shoulders and yells 'Coffees ready papa!' Before casually slamming the door shut behind her. The slamming of the door causes poor Spiff to fall back down with a loud thump. He groans in pain and raises a hand, performing his species’ variation of a middle finger at the camera. The outro plays.



TOP COMMENT: Wow... who knew Eridani could jump that high...



Spiffs reply: DONT. YOU. DARE.



Reply: DO what? I wasn't about to do a scientific test on what Eridani are like when they are scared! I wasn't! Honest... :)



Spiffs response: You heartless monster.



Reply: LOL

""Great Days and Glorious Victory! Welcome back to... Phasmophobia… I don't want to be here.""



Spiffle looks at the camera and frowns, clearly not enjoying himself.



Plague - ""Oh come on Spiff... It can't be that bad!""



Spiffle scowls and switches to in-game, revealing three other players, two of which are in VR attempting to do a voodoo dance... or something.



Spiff - ""I brought friends to suffer with me this time. They apparently like it. This is Plague, Red and Alex.""



The three newcomers say hello in their respective ways. Red and Alex are both in VR, as their characters are hunched over slightly with some odd belt mechanism haphazardly wrapped around the waist. The arms also flail about a lot more than other characters. Red is oddly Irish, Alex strangely South African and Plague is very American.



Plague - ""I still find it genuinely amazing that we managed to get the game working.""



Red - ""No shit right? How many mod patches did we have to install again? Seven?""



Alex - ""Eight actually but it was enough to be annoying. Why are we using the ancient version of this game again?""



Spiffle - ""Because I don't have an Immersion Lounge, just a Desktop. It may be 5 Terabytes of RAM and have a 25KX graphics card but it still can't handle the new stuff. I have to take out a loan to get that kind of setup.""



Alex - ""Oh so we're here because it's cheap. Fair enough. Still not bad for a game that's a few hundred years old huh?""



Plague - ""Not bad at all. So many memories... Anyway, Shall we begin?""



Spiffle - ""Yes we shall. Are we going to start simple?""



Plague - ""Yes we shall. Uhhh… Bleasdale Farmhouse to start. Then we see how far we can go. Alright everybody ready up.""



Alex - ""Okay... Controls are still a bit weird but I'm getting into it.""



The conversation is cut as the game loads up. Siff finds himself eerily alone for a few moments, then as he spawns in the game, the other three are nowhere to be found. The back of the van is empty, save him, and none of the equipment has spawned nor any objectives.



Spiff - ""Hello...?""



Red - ""Wolololooooo…""



Spiff gets his balls scared off him again as Red spawns and performs a ritual 'VR mode am neat' dance. Reds movements are strange, even for a human, and his character doesn't quite understand the laws of biology as arms and legs are intersecting with each other as he walks around.



Spiff - ""GODs that is... odd. That is very odd.""



Red - ""Why yes I am. Your point?""



SPiff - ""Uhm... Fair.""



Red approaches Spiff as Alex starts to spawn in. Red appears to be doing something.



Spiff - ""What the hell are you doing?""



Red - ""Attempting to cup your balls.""



Spiff makes a noise of disgust as Alex finally spawns in, quickly followed by Warlord. Red cackles away and attempts a VR voodoo dance of some kind with Alex. It's a simple moment of levity before the game starts, and finally the level finishes loading in. The screen changes to a split screen format, showing each player's screen in turn. Apparently everyone is recording for the sake of giving Spiff more footage to use. Francine, Spiffs Editor, has graciously given a small screen on the top right that shows a relevant perspective of another player.



Plague - ""Okay let's see.... Got us on Intermediate to start out. Alright our ghost is Robin Lewis, responds to: 'We're unsure' so let's assume responds to one person... Uhhh lets see... Breaker is in the Entry room, back right corner. I will go for the breaker off the bat. I have a photo camera, EMF and... Flashlight.""



Spiff - ""I have... Book and UV light.""



Plague - ""Cool what's everyone else packing?""



Alex - ""I'm still loading in hold on a sec. My games lagging like a bitch.



Spiff - ""Hold on, Alex is still loading in.""



Plague - ""Too late I'm already in. Haha.""



Alex - ""Oh there we go. Uhh… I got the DOTS and the Crucifix.""



Spiff - ""Can I volunteer to cower in the van? I don't want to go in there.""



Red - ""Oh you wanna be the van chicken? Okay sure. Drop your kit off inside when we find the ghost room and then you can go be a coward.""



Spiff visibly scowls at the statement.



Spiff - ""I am not a coward.""



Red - ""Then step up and go forward like the rest of us. Get in chicken.""



Spiff scoffs at the suggestion then heads inside with everyone. He decides to follow Red, who is still attempting various VR based voodoo dances as she walks along. They all check everything on the ground floor with mild bantering and then head upstairs. The corner storage room upstairs ends up being the Ghost Room and they all set up the equipment accordingly. Spiff drops the book and UV light and heads back to the van to pick up a bigger camera and a few other things.



Red and Alex are still goofing around in VR and trying to pick up various objects and see what they do. The screen suddenly shakes, a voice or breath comes from behind, everybody goes quiet and immediately finds a hiding spot. Spiff panics and retreats outside.



Plague - ""Ghost event! Ghost event! We need to hurry up.""



Spiff - ""I am NOT going back in there.""



Alex and Red - ""Coward.""



Spiffle makes a disapproving scoffing noise and retreats into the van to watch the feed. Spiff gets in and looks around.



Spiff - ""Ooh! Ohh look! Guys, first side job done! 'Find evidence of the paranormal with an EMF Reader.'""



Plague - ""Nice Nice!""



Spiff ambles about as Red wanders in and starts collecting things. Spiff sets up one of the big cameras, not making any comments about how his setup is suddenly excessively overpowered for a guy who is only level 3. Spiff grabs the large camera and starts up towards the house and heads in, placing the second camera on the opposite wall facing the door. He then heads back out, visibly shudders as he finally leaves the building and heads back to cower in the van.



Spiff watches the camera setup, switching between the three they had available. one in the doorway facing a set of lockers, one on the opposite side and the security cam at the front of the house. Everything suddenly goes quiet. The screen quickly switches to Red's perspective and shows her being killed by a ghost as two greasy, dead hands cover the camera. Spiff seems oblivious and carries on flipping through cameras. The group's radio static finally returns.



Plague - ""I heard death sounds. Who'd we lose?""



Spiff - ""Wait what? Uh..."" Spiff checks the monitors. Red has a question mark next to her name. ""Uhh… Red. Apparently. Does the question mark mean dead?""



Plague - ""Red? Damn, okay...""



Spiff - ""Oh by the way guys, Red is dead and all our sanity's gone which means bonus objective complete.""



Alex - ""Epic.""



Plague - ""Okay so... red died at the doorway into the room so... Yeah... Where are you guys now?""



Alex - ""I'm in the van with Spiff groping his character's ass.""



Spiff - ""EwwwwwWWWW BEGONE!""



Alex just laughs and continues what he was doing.



Plague - ""HUNT Everyone hide now!""



Alex - ""You're the only one still inside!""



Alex laughs as Plagues mic goes dead. The hunt continues for a lot longer than usual and Alex heads to the front door to try to get back in. The camera switches and shows Plague getting yanked out of his hiding spot and killed off.



Alex - ""Is the door still locked or what?""



Spiff - ""Uhh… Lemme che-Oh. Were clear. Plague is dead.""



Alex - ""Is he really?""



Spiff - ""Yep. He is. Oh! It's going again! It's going again!""



Another hunt immediately starts. Spiff just looks at potential lists for what the ghost is and fails to notice Alex dying too. The screen switches again and shows Alex's viewpoint as he's killed while running down the staircase. Alex is spitting expletives at high volume at the ghost as he is killed off.



Spiff - ""Okay then... no DOTS... No Orbs... What do you guys thi-Oh... They're all dead... uhhh… I'm just going to guess a random thing and call it. I am NOT going in there.""



Spiff chickens out and guesses 'Demon', then hits the escape button. It turns out the ghost was a Shade, but the team gets a few things, with Spiff getting a high enough XP boost from a weekend event he unlocks the Parabolic Microphone.



Spiff - ""Well that was... Enlightening...""



Alex - ""I was cursing that thing out the entire time. Anyway, what next?""



Alex and Red dick around a bit while Plague gets it ready again, attempting to duel with each other in VR. This time it's back to the Bleasdale Farmhouse for another go. The game loads in and Red and Alex banter with each other for a bit as Plague loads in.



Plague - ""Okay... uhhh… Let's see what we ca-what are you two doing!?""



Alex and Red are both dicking about, duelling each other with camera tripods with both of them having a giggle.



Red - ""Duelling what does it look like?""



Alex - ""En guard!""



Spiff - ""Is this how you play in VR games? Is this really what these games are about?""



Plague - ""No they are just idiots. We all are. That's why I have no face recording to send you. I am not wearing pants.""



Spiff just blinks, shakes his head and starts loading up.



Spiff - ""Okay I got the EMF and the photo camera. Who's got the journal thingy and UV?""



Alex - ""I got it.""



Plague - ""So as for objectives we need Sanity, Parabolic Mic and EMF Readings.""



Alex - ""Well I got everything in my inventory, you know it's annoying how you only have two inventory slots. I mean you can still carry everything in your hands but... yeah.""



Plague - ""Hold on, I forgot uhh… Okay, the ghost's name is Jack Todd, responds to people who are alone.""



The group all head inside, Alex still whining about the inventory limitations. After being told that the difficulty is Professional Difficulty, Spiff gets a bit nervous as they wander aimlessly about the building. They find nothing downstairs and head upstairs. They find lowering temperatures downstairs and Spiff is asked to open a door for Red. Near the stairwell to the attic, the temps drop considerably. The group wanders for a bit longer and eventually settles on the stairwell to the attic. Spiff chickens out.



Spiff - ""Okay so I'm just gonna drop all this stuff here and head back to the van.""



Red - ""Chicken.""



Spiff - ""YES. I'm going to bring a camera or something back though, so, be back shortly.""



Spiff heads back to the van and notices activity has spiked randomly.



Spiff - ""Ooh! Activity spiked!  Currently two-no, three!""



Alex returns to the truck too and starts collecting other stuff to use.



Alex - Are you going to stay here or-?""



Spiff - ""No I'm gonna grab a DOTS and a camera, put them upstairs. Then I'm gonna go back down here and be a coward.""



Plague - ""What's happening out there? Can we get some sound monitoring stuff down here as well?""



Red - ""I'm on it. Bringing the mic setup now.""



Spiff - ""Okay the camera and DOTS are placed, I shall now tactically retreat.""



A few moments of the group just wandering and setting up their gear follows. Plague suddenly gets a spike of EMF activity.



Plague - ""Oh shit i'm getting a spike of EMF activity! Here in this room! We need to reset our gear in here.""



Spiff - ""Okay, heading back in to help. What room is it?""



Plague - ""Room next to the stairs, looks like a back bedroom.""



As Spiff enters and gets upstairs to the Ghost Room, activity spikes, the ghost hunts. With nowhere to hide, Spiff panics and runs into a bathroom, hiding behind a clothes dryer. The sound of someone being horribly murdered echoes through the room. The secondary camera pops up and shows Red's perspective as her character is choked to death and left on the ground , with the camera setup she was holding falling to the floor and glitching out a bit.



Plague - ""Ghost event, ghost event! All clear now.""



Spiff - ""No it wasn't! Reds dead!""



Plague - ""Reds de-Oh shit... Wait, that's not Red? Is it? Oh that IS Red, shit... You two seriously need to change characters. I cant tell you apart...""



Alex - ""DASS RAYCISS!!!""



The group, including Red, share a hearty chuckle at the moment and resume rebuilding their setup. Spiff hastily returns to the truck to hide and Red immediately starts annoying the crap out of Plague from beyond-the-grave.



Plague - ""Okay we need to set up the gear and OKAY I SEE THE FUKKIN BALLS OKAY!""



Red's perspective pops up showing Red attempting to bash Plagues face in with a set of tennis balls. The group has a funny moment and Spiff turns on the camera as he gets back in the Van. He can clearly see blocks and other random objects whizzing around the room as The camera shows Reds perspective too. She's giggling like a madwoman while throwing things at everyone.



Everyone is being too silly to notice however. Spiff does.



Spiff - ""Ghost orbs! Ghost orbs! I see Ghost Orbs!""



The screen flickers, showing some kind of figure appearing just as Alex enters the room, then vanishes again. This freaks Spiff out a little bit.



Spiff - ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT!?""



Alex - ""What, did you see something?""



Spiff - ""I saw a figure or tall... something appeared, walked in place then disappeared!""



Plague - ""Oop, that was the ghost, we got DOTS boys! Mark it off, let's see what else this guys giving us.""



Spiff visibly shudders at the mention, but marks it off. Spiff casually just resumes watching the cameras and suddenly everyone goes quiet. Too quiet. The secondary camera appears and shows Alex being killed outside the room in the hallway.



Spiff - ""uhhh… Anyone there?""



Plague - ""Alex is dead, Spiff it's just us now.""



The ghost becomes increasingly aggressive. From this point onward, Red and Alex's perspective appear on the screen and occasionally the audio between the living and the dead pop up, showing Alex and Red engaging in what can only be described as a virtual wine tasting, with the two VR players faffing about with glasses and bottles.



Plague - ""Uhh… Spiff this guy is extremely aggressive. We just burned a crucifix, can you check what options we have and see what we can get from that?""



Spiff - ""Uh sure. So long as I don't have to go in there.""



Plague - ""Pussy.""



Spiff - ""YES.""



DOTS and ghost Orbs are checked, leaving Banshee, Yurei, Yokai, Raiju and Thaye as the only ones available.



Spiff and Plague continue the investigation while screens show Alex and Red starting to haul various objects out of the house and loading them into the truck. Someone new pops in the discord call.



DragonCat64 - ""Yo hey what the ffffock are you guys playin'? Where's Plague at?""



Spiff - ""Phasmophobia and… Uhh… Dunno… oh he's being hunted at the moment.""



The camera switches to Plagues perspective and shows him hiding in a closet as the ghosts footsteps echo outside.



DragonCat64 - ""Oh... well hope he dies then! Wanna go do some trench warfare later?""



Spiff - ""Oh hell yeah! What's trench warfare?""



DragonCat64 - ""Foxhole.""



Spiff - ""Oh yeah that game... Haven't played it, so, sure im up for it!""



DragonCat64 - ""Epic. Ping me when you dicks are done.""



DragonCat64 leaves the discord call. The camera resumes focusing on Red and Alex in the background as they both chuckle at each other while they start to pile up various objects onto the keyboard of the computer in the truck. Plague and Spiff continue actually playing the game while Alex and Red goof around. The camera switches to the perspectives of Tweedle dumbasss and Twoodle stupid, Red and Alex laughing like hyenas as they start creating a tower of random crap in front of the computer screen while attempting to shove random objects - such as knives and frying pans - into Spiff and Plagues characters.



Plague - ""So... We got a Parabolic mic. All secondary objectives completed so... That's good. Uhhh… Most likely I think either Banshee or Thaye. Lemme check and see if it gets less aggressive over time and we can confirm if it's a Thaye… Uhm... Ghost Writing maybe? Let me go check if the... Well I would check but these fuckos keep blocking up the camera...""



Red and Alex laugh and continue to pile random objects on the keyboard as Plague switches through cameras.



Plague - ""Okay I'm gonna go check if we got Ghost writing.""



Spiff - ""Okay. I'm sorry I can't be more useful and you have to do this alone.""



Plague - ""It's fine, it just means I get the right to call you a whiny scaredy bitch boi whenever I want and you can't be mad about it.""



Spiff - ""... Dammit.""



Red and Alex both laugh as Plague heads inside. Spiff is distracted by Alex and red using Frying Pans to have a  duel in front of the computer screen. So distracted he doesn't notice the ghost went back to Hunt. Thankfully Plague survived. Plague exits and grabs some audio equipment. This time Spiff is standing next to the activity monitor as the ghost hunts. Spiff goes pale green at the noise the ghost makes as it Hunts Plague. Heavy, raspy, angry breathing sets Spiffs body all a shiver and he visibly moves away from his desk.



Alex and Red on the other hand start making a tower with all the random objects they found on top of the keyboard blocking the screen. Once Plague is done being hunted Spiff moves all the stuff off the keyboard so he can see what's going on, toppling a leaning tower of glass and dishware. This causes Alex and Red to become somewhat annoyed. The cameras from their perspectives show Alex and Red attempting to give him the middle finger. Spiff and Plague take the guess of Yokai in the end after a bit of discussion and call it there.



As soon as Spiff loads in, Alex and Red start cursing him out.



Spiff - ""Woah, woah what did I do!?""



Alex - ""He knocked our tower down! Repeatedly!""



Red - ""We were building a nice little tower of fun and you knocked it down every time you absolute bastard!""



Alex - ""You suck, no blowjobs for you anymore.""



Red - ""Never again!""



Spiff - ""Wait, what?""



Plague - ""Don't worry about it.""



The next level starts. Just as the level loads in, Spiff says to himself ""God these guys are weird...""



Plague - ""I heard that!""



Alex - ""Hey who the fuck you calling weird alien boy!?""



The boys are back at Tanglewood Drive for a relatively easy mission this time.



Plague - ""Okay... Our ghost is Sharne Bailey, responds to people who are alone. Optionals are EMF, Motion sensor and prevent a hunt with a crucifix. Breakers in the garage, let's go boys.""



The guys wander in. Plague finds a spine in the laundry room, takes a photo and picks it up. They find a Summoning Circle in the basement almost immediately and score some extra cash by photographing it.



Red - ""Oh hell yeah, Circle! Let's summon this bitch.""



Spiff - ""Can I leave the house before you do that please?""



Red - ""Fuck you lets summon this bitch!""



The group bicker a bit and find the Ghost Room, the child's bedroom and they start setting up all their gear. The ghost becomes active almost immediately and the EMF reader starts going off, completing one objective. Spiff chickens out and returns for gear, then immediately runs back into the truck. Spiff waits by the computer screen and spots something.



Spiff - ""Ohh Ghost Orbs! Confirm Ghost Orbs! Wow that was fast, got one right off the bat. How ‘bout that...""



Plague - ""We have Ghost Writing we have Ghost Writing! Check that off. Hell yeah!""



Spiff - ""Okay we have a Mare, a Revenant, or a Thaye.""



Plague - ""Okay lets go set off the Summoning Circle. Does anyone have matches or a lighter?""



Alex - ""I got the lighter. I'm on my way. Anybody put salt in there?""



Red - ""I put salt down already, got it. Just need the lighter.""



Plague - ""Okay bitches lets do this! Crucifix down.""



The camera is in the perfect spot to capture the moment. A child appears in the summoning circle scaring Spiff out of his seat as a horrific scream is heard through the microphones. The candles are all extinguished as a small figure appears, causing the images to flicker.



Plague - ""GO GO GO!!!""



Alex, Red and Plague all scramble and put a new Crucifix down and head back upstairs to the bedroom.



Plague - ""Ohhh we got a crucifix burned in the bedroom! Someone uhh… Get a thermometer or something in here, we need to check.""



Red - ""I'm on it!""



The group scrambles and eventually Red goes into the bedroom with the thermometer.



Red - ""We got freezing temps! Freezing temps confirmed.""



Spiff - ""That means the ghost is a Revenant. Okay Jobs done. Everybody out.""



Plague - ""Lets go lets go boys!""



The three evacuate and head to the van. Everybody double checks the objectives and confirms Revenant, then hits the end button.



Plague - Oh god it's a game where we are ALL alive and we got the objective and everything! HOLY SHIT that was good!""



Red - ""Lets goo boys that was our best game yet I think!""



Alex - ""That was fantastic, even levelled up. But, the pain in my joints is... Painful. I'm gonna call it here, see you guys next time.""



Spiff - ""Oh wait, DragonCat asked us to join him for Foxhole when we're done. You guys up for that?""



Red - ""Yeah im game. Let me feel my arms and shoulders again then I'll see if I can log in.""



Alex - ""I will have to reinstall but I think I can join in time.""



Spiff - ""Oh EXCELLENT! More footage I can make more money off my friends-Imean-Entertain people.""



Red - ""Bitch.""



Spiffle's outro plays, this time with outtakes and silly screen clips for everyone else’s perspectives of silly goings on while they played.





TOP COMMENT: (translated from Eridani) Are all humans this weird?



Spiffs reply - YES. YES THEY ARE AND DON'T EVER BELIEVE THEM WHEN THEY SAY THEY AREN'T.



AlexMG - Oh come on... you know you liked it!



Spiffs reply - Well maybe a little...



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



I actually played this game and based the scribble on actual footage with my less-than-sane-friends and the real thing is a lot more unhinged than i gave it credit for here so... yeah.

I'm hoping to raise a MINIMUM of 250 USD per month as part of my attempts to turn this into a living. 250 USD is my MINIMUM to break even for the month so, please?

## Key Features Analysis

The best​ bike cup⁤ holders balance secure holding, adaptability, and ease of use.They should be ​easy to install, compatible ⁢with a wide ​range of cup sizes, and durable enough​ to ⁣withstand the rigors of cycling.

**Adjustable‌ Clamp Diameter**

A key feature is an adjustable clamp diameter, typically ranging from 0.8 inches to 1.5 inches. This adjustability allows ‍the cup holder to be securely attached to⁢ handlebars, stems, or other suitable parts of a variety of bikes, including mountain bikes, road bikes, and electric bikes. A wide‌ adjustable range increases the cup holder’s compatibility across different bike types and frame sizes.

**Durable material Construction**

High-quality cup​ holders use ‌materials like‍ aluminum alloy, durable plastics, or even carbon fiber composites. Aluminum alloy provides a strong and ⁣lightweight option,resisting corrosion and wear from the elements. Durable​ plastics, often reinforced with fiberglass or nylon, offer ‌excellent ⁤impact resistance. The material choice‍ directly⁤ impacts the cup⁣ holder’s lifespan and its ability to withstand vibrations and impacts during rides.

**Secure⁣ Cup Retention⁤ System**

The best cup holders incorporate​ a retention system to keep your drink from spilling. This​ might involve rubber grips, adjustable arms, or a net-like structure. Rubber grips ‌provide a non-slip surface for the cup,preventing it from sliding around.Adjustable arms can accommodate‌ different cup sizes, ensuring a snug fit. The retention system is crucial for maintaining stability ⁣and preventing spills, especially on uneven roads.

**360-Degree rotation**

Some advanced models‍ feature a 360-degree rotation⁢ capability, allowing you to adjust the angle ⁢of the ⁤cup holder for ‍optimal access and visibility. This flexibility is especially useful if the mounting location is at an awkward angle. A 360-degree rotation mechanism ensures that the cup holder won’t interfere with your riding⁣ position or obstruct your view.

**Tool-Free Installation**

User-friendliness is paramount, and tool-free installation ​is a notable advantage. Cup holders designed for easy installation utilize clamps with⁤ swift-release mechanisms or straps that can be easily tightened ‍by‍ hand. Tool-free​ installation saves time and eliminates the need for specialized tools,making ⁢it ⁣easy to transfer the cup holder between bikes or adjust its position on the go.

Key features:

**Improved Safety**

Riding with one hand while holding a ⁤drink is perilous, especially in ⁢traffic or on bumpy roads.

**Enhanced Convenience**

Having a drink readily accessible while cycling saves you the hassle of stopping or‌ reaching into a backpack.

Dehydration ⁢can‍ significantly impact performance and enjoyment, especially during longer rides. A​ bike cup ⁤holder keeps water or⁣ sports drinks within easy ‍reach, encouraging frequent hydration. Easy access encourages⁤ consistent sips, preventing dehydration and maintaining energy levels throughout your ride.

**versatile Usage**

Beyond just holding drinks, a quality cup holder can also accommodate other‍ small items.Many cyclists use them for carrying items such as small portable speakers, phones or repair tools. This versatility adds ⁤to the cup holder’s value, turning it into a multi-purpose ​accessory.

1lrkhoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wls/comments/1lrkhoc/please_help/,Please Help!,"I am two years post-op from my gastric bypass surgery. At the time of the surgery, I weighed 246 pounds. Since then, I have been fluctuating between losing and gaining weight initially I lost 150 pounds but then went back up to 180 pounds, and so on. I've been following the diet closely, and I also started going to the gym and doing Pilates.

I shared my concerns with my doctors, and they advised me to stop weighing myself for a while, which I did. A few days before my one year anniversary post-op, I weighed myself and was at 144 pounds. However, a few weeks later, my weight rose to 177 pounds, and now, two years after the surgery, I'm back up to 190 pounds. I returned to my doctor's office to express my concerns because, in my opinion, this is not normal.

Initially, they suggested that I might be gaining muscle, but I don’t believe that’s the case since my belly is getting larger. Some of my clothes no longer fit me. They also suggested that it might be hormonal but I’m not on birth control, nor do I drink alcohol or coffee. I eat almost the same things every day, an omelet for breakfast with vegies and chicken, a protein bar, yugort or fruit for a snack, for lunch I have some meat with salad, sometimes I have a small taco bowl with brown rice, avocado with grilled chicken. For a snack I have a yugort based smoothie with fruits no sugar added, Snacks consist of fruits, protein bars, and dinner is basically the same as lunch. 

Long story short, I have an appointment with a doctor who is going to prescribe me weight loss medication, and my surgeon has also offered the option for another surgery. I'm really stressed about this and just need some advice. I'm losing my mind and am so scared of gaining weight and going back to where I was before. Has anyone else had this issue? Or has anyone had the surgery twice?",0,1751640305.0,wls,3,0.5,False

1lrkcug,https://www.reddit.com/r/rollercoasters/comments/1lrkcug/a_holiday_at_holiday_world/,A Holiday at [Holiday World],"What an excellent park! I had a last minute opportunity to run out to Holiday World yesterday, 7/3, and while there have been several parks in the Midwest/Great Lakes region that have been vying for my attention this year, a friend of mine went to Hollywood Nights earlier this year and has been buzzing about it ever since. It was time to finally ride Voyage, the second highest coaster on my bucket list. 

Weather was probably about as good as we could hope for; hot but not sticky and not much wind. Most of the crowds were packed into Splashing Safari for the whole day and the heat made the rides run hard. This actually highlights some of the excellent park management offerings that Holiday World offers: free drinks and sunscreen. This is an incredible policy that I wish more parks followed, and it made it incredibly safe and easy to visit even during hot weather. It felt like park management was really invested in the safety and comfort of their guests. 

The park was very clean and decently pretty for being a mid-budget. The Christmas entrance area is very charming and has the best architecture by far. Thanksgiving has some nice buildings and the scenery around Thunderbird and Good Gravy are really nice, but it's layout is kind of awful and it lacks trees. Halloween has a ton of big lovely trees and some fun corny Halloweentown buildings in garish orange and purple- the entire land feels like a Pretzel dark ride. I almost wish that there was more variety here- the goofy aesthetic and loud colors were exhausting to spend time around. I kept forgetting Fourth of July even existed at this park. 

The food was unfortunately a disappointment. We tried the turkey dinner in the Thanksgiving section and it was frankly bad- the turkey was dry, the mashed potatoes flavorless, and the chicken and dumplings had a really gross texture. I go all out every Thanksgiving, which didn't help the comparison. In my opinion, stick with something fried when you're here- it's probably a safer bet. We got some iced coffees at the nearby Perky Turkey that were really tasty, though. Merch is good here too- new shirts are pricey but the old ones have a decent markdown, and there's a ton of fun bits and bobs aside from that. I appreciate all the kitchen equipment for Good Gravy and the wide selection of Christmas tree ornaments. I wish I had money to buy all of the plussed up coasterdynamix sets, but $75 a pop was too much to justify. 

The Rides:

Pretty much all rides were a walk-on or station wait until the water park closed (I guess this is common here?). Each coaster that could was running 2 trains, which I appreciated, but the ops weren't particularly fast, especially on Thunderbird. Train 2 often ended up sitting in the sun while the other prepped to launch, which was fairly annoying. 

Raven (x1): I love this ride's layout and setting, and some new track in the first half was glass smooth. I hope they continue that work next off season, because the back half is pretty rough. I was open to riding this again but we ran out of time. People aren't lying about that 5th drop, though: nearly sent me to the moon in the back row. 8/10. 

Legend (x1): I can appreciate that this is a good, forceful layout, but this year it's running even rougher than Raven and the laterals are brutal. I nearly crushed my wife to death on the main helix. I'd love to ride this again after some off season work. Also, I bruised my knee on the restraint and had to deal with that for the rest of the day, so that wasn't fun. 7/10. 

Good Gravy (x2): we rode this twice, front and back, and the front is definitely better for the height on the forward spike. This ride is utterly charming, has some decent forces and speed for a family coaster, and has one of my favorite train designs on earth. Decent contender for the smoothest coaster I've ever ridden. Not bad for my first modern Vekoma. 8/10. 

Voyage (x3): we rode this twice in the very back and once in the front row. This was another lesson in managing expectations: I had this insanely hyped up in my head and was super excited for my first ride in the back car, but of course on the second camelback my restraint notched down and stapled me so bad I was in pain for the rest of the (long, long) layout. Front row was fun, but after that I was so exhausted I wasn't even sure I liked the coaster. Yes it's amazing, an engineering marvel, but even though it's shockingly smooth it beats you up like you owe it money- it's endless and just doesn't slow down, and it's absurdly forceful for a wooden coaster. My last ride was it's redemption, though: I held up my lap bar the whole time and got nearly standing airtime over the first drop. It was somehow running FASTER at the end of the day and every element hit like a hammer. This is an amazing coaster, one of the signature achievements in their entire history. I'm not sure where it ranks for me overall, but it's single digits. That last ride converted me. 10/10. 

Thunderbird (x4): this ride has a dumb placement in the park but goddamn if it isn't the most fun coaster there. Punchy launch, forceful layout, comfy trains, smooth as glass- it's perfect. I rode very front and very back on both sides and the front is actually more forceful. I love the left side because that slow roll at the end is bonkers when you start sideways and turn UNDER. Weirdest hangtime I've ever felt. I know this ride was probably too expensive for Holiday World to justify buying, but I'm so happy it's here. 9/10. 

Overall stellar park and I had a wonderful experience. I'm super excited to see what they add next- hopefully something to fill out their family coaster offerings, or a high profile flat ride. Also, if you're in the area, consider checking out Louisville, KY. It's an easy hour drive away and its a really cool city. ",8,1751639962.0,rollercoasters,3,1.0,False

✧ space details
• ground floor: ~10 sqm, already set up as a salon but i plan on renovating it to match my rates (it's fairly high compared to others rates start at ₱900) may kasama narin na 1hp non-inverter ac & glass sliding door with roll up.
• second floor: ~64 sqm, 1-bedroom unit (needs ventilation fixes, repaint & furniture)
• monthly rent: ₱18,000
• estimated monthly cost (utilities, wifi, misc, cushion): ~₱34,000
• i used savings + a ₱100k loan from my tita for downpayment and startup funds
• mura kasi super run down but i have a vision!

✧ business plans
• downstairs → piercing + tattoo studio (with henna too)
• upstairs → planning a cozy coffee + photobooth concept (moody, retro vibes, print-your-memories style)
• i have a decent camera & a printer that's ready to use

✧ about me
i’m still a 1st year college business management student (planning to take a LOA this august since i just went back to school to see if it's for me). no big investor, no family business backing me. my partner (22M) helps with clients and physical work, but i handle all the financial, legal, and branding responsibilities alone. i have had over 7 businesses since the age of 10 (small businesses like camera buy & sell, cookies, milktea etc. all run from the comfort of my home) and have had 2 jobs as a call center agent. di ako nagtagal, ayaw ko ng boss. mas trip ko pa mag work 24/7 para sa sarili ko kesa 8hrs para sa ibang tayo.

this is my first time renting, and i’m honestly scared. i want to do things right — but i also know timing matters.

based on my previous years, rainy season is always slow. june was already good considering na slow month siya (60 clients, ₱1,692/client avg), but i really want to open now so i can catch the ber months surge, which is always my busiest season.

i’d love to hear honest advice from anyone who has:
• opened a piercing or tattoo studio
• started a coffee shop or photo studio
• signed their first lease young or solo

was it worth it? what mistakes should i avoid? how did you survive your first few months?

thank you so much in advance 🫶

We were together for 20 yrs, married 17. The separation was her doing, and I won't go into details here, but best way to describe is she had midlife crisis. She turned off connection with me in snap of fingers 3.5 yrs so, and nothing I could do ever fixed it. Even marriage counselor said it was clear she moved on from me a long time ago. 

A couple months ago I moved into my new house. The first day I left what was my home to stay at my new place was terrible. Left my old place in quiet tears, up half the night, and woke up feeling lost, heartbroken, miserable  alone, and abandoned. 

Now, my stbx recently told me she's getting an alarm system, and mentioned some creepy guy in neighborhood that had freaked her out. She and I are trying to be amicable, and it finally comes out that she had been outside, he walked by, they talked, he asked if she was married, she said separated, and he asked if she would like to get coffee sometime so she gave him her number. Later he started blowing up phone before they even got coffee (stage 5 clinger).

So even though we have a formal separation agreement done, I felt for our kids sake we should have a quick talk about dating. It's her life and her right, but it needs to be serious before she ever introduces kids, and I would appreciate a heads up if she is gonna introduce kids. I will honor the same rules once I start dating. 

Now is where it gets weird. She starts making  snide comments about how I am moving so fast in buying a house and now wanting to date others. She can't believe I already want to date, and she has NO INTEREST in dating anyone. I point out that actually, she is the reason I'm bringing this up, since she was giving her number to another dude for a coffee date THE DAY AFTER I MOVED OUT (yeah, it was literally the next morning). She tells me I'm crazy, it wasn't a date, they were just gonna meet up at one point for coffee, and she was just trying to make new friends. 

So, I guess, how am I supposed to take this? This woman is a friggin PhD, so not like she's stupid. Am I supposed to believe that she really had no idea he was asking her out on a date? And, considering that she clearly moved on so long ago, why is it that the idea of me trying to move on with my life and maybe even date again one day has her so upset? 

I feel manipulation yet again, but I could be reading this wrong.  Thoughts?",1,1751639608.0,Separation,1,1.0,False

1lrk5gt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lrk5gt/severing_the_mate_bond_when_his_mistress_became/,Severing the Mate Bond When His Mistress Became His New Luna By Evelyn Harper,"Three years ago, a car accident shattered Roselyn’s dreams of dancing, leaving her broken and dependent on Alpha Patrick King, leader of the Silver Moon Pack. He promised to care for her forever, but on their mating night, he abandoned her to attend the debut of Ivanna Shaw, the new lead dancer. Betrayed and humiliated, Roselyn uncovers a devastating truth: Patrick was behind the accident that destroyed her life. Now, she seeks to sever their mate bond and make him pay. But as secrets unravel and tensions rise, Roselyn must confront the man she once trusted—and the darkness he hides. Will she reclaim her freedom, or will Patrick’s dominance crush her completely?

# Chapter 1 - The Shattered Bond and Hidden Truth

The car accident three years ago shattered my dreams of ever stepping onto the stage I loved so dearly.

Alpha Patrick King, leader of the Silver Moon Pack, told me it was just an unfortunate accident, and that if I became his mate, he would take care of me for the rest of my life.

But on our mating night, he left me alone to attend the debut performance of Ivanna Shaw, the company’s new lead dancer.

When I presented the papers to sever our mate bond and set us free, Alpha Patrick flew into a rage, demanding to know why I didn’t love him anymore, why I wanted to break the bond.

Why? Because back then, I didn’t know that he was the one who had crushed my dreams with his own hands.

Now that the truth is out, of course I want to sever the bond, and more than that, I want Alpha Patrick to lose everything.

==============================

On the night of our mating ceremony, Alpha Patrick didn’t come home.

Instead, he went to support Ivanna Shaw’s debut performance as the new lead dancer.

I stared at the gossip news popping up on my phone.

""Why did Alpha King abandon his new mate on their mating night to attend Ivanna Shaw’s performance?""

""Is there something going on between Alpha King and Ivanna Shaw?""

""Was Alpha King’s mating to his new mate truly out of love?""

I couldn’t believe it. Alpha Patrick had always been so good to me, never putting me in such an embarrassing position before.

But the Alpha Patrick who had just completed our mating ceremony today seemed like a completely different wolf.

In disbelief, I called Alpha Patrick’s number.

A girl answered on the other end—it was Ivanna Shaw.

She said Alpha Patrick was in the shower and wouldn’t be coming home tonight.

Then, what sounded like Alpha Patrick’s voice came through, distant, as if he was far away.

He was telling Ivanna to hurry up and shower, as if he couldn’t wait.

I didn’t want to hear anymore and frantically ended the call.

Just like that, Alpha Patrick didn’t come home that night.

The next day, even more explosive gossip headlines dominated the news.

""Famous dancer Ivanna Shaw spotted leaving a hotel with a wolf suspected to be Alpha King.""

The news was sensational, but my heart was frozen.

Alpha Patrick, why did you go through all the trouble to be so good to me, only to abandon me like this after we completed the mating ceremony?

I wanted to call Alpha Patrick and get some answers.

After more than a dozen unanswered calls, Alpha Patrick’s Beta called me to say that Alpha Patrick’s phone was with him.

Alpha Patrick was in a meeting and couldn’t take my calls, so I should stop calling.

It felt like Alpha Patrick was deliberately avoiding me, so I decided to go to his office.

But when I arrived at his company, there was no meeting happening in the conference room.

In Alpha Patrick’s office, however, there was another she-wolf—Ivanna Shaw.

# Chapter 2 - The Shattered Vows of an Alpha

When I pushed open the office door, Ivanna Shaw was perched on Alpha Patrick’s lap, her voice sweet and pleading as she asked him to throw a celebration party for her. Alpha Patrick, noticing the intrusion, immediately grabbed a folder from his desk and hurled it toward the door without even looking up.

""Didn’t I say no one was allowed in? Mitchell Hughes, are you trying to get yourself demoted?""

His voice carried the sharp edge of an Alpha tone, commanding and unforgiving. He didn’t even bother to see who had entered, his irritation palpable at being interrupted. The folder struck my leg, and the sharp pain made me wince. Only then did Alpha Patrick glance toward the door.

I demanded to know why.

Ivanna, sensing the tension, tried to make herself scarce. In a syrupy voice, she told Alpha Patrick she’d be waiting for him in their usual hotel room that evening, adding that she didn’t want to intrude on our conversation. But as she attempted to stand and leave, Alpha Patrick’s hand firmly gripped her waist, pulling her back.

""She can hear this,"" he said, his voice icy, the Alpha tone lacing his words with authority.

The pressure of his hand made Ivanna let out a soft gasp. Alpha Patrick didn’t answer my question, but his hands continued to roam over Ivanna’s body, shameless and deliberate. My face burned with anger and humiliation as I yanked Ivanna away from him.

I stared at Alpha Patrick and demanded again, ""Why? Why are you doing this to me?""

He looked at me, his expression cold and detached, and said, ""Now it’s your turn to know what it feels like to be ignored.""

With that, he shoved me aside, wrapped his arm around Ivanna, and strode out of the office, his Alpha aura radiating dominance and dismissal.

Alpha Patrick’s sudden change in behavior left me stunned. Just two days ago, he had been tender, calling me Roselyn, promising to love and care for me for the rest of my life. He had vowed to help me overcome the shadow of the accident, to stand by me as I healed. But as soon as the mating ceremony ended, everything seemed to shift.

As I left his office, I overheard some pack members whispering. They said that since I could no longer dance, I was worthless. Ivanna, on the other hand, had both beauty and talent. She was the rising star of the dance world, and she had been openly in love with Alpha Patrick since she was eighteen, her devotion unwavering.

Alpha Patrick had endured my stubborn and difficult personality for three years, and now he had finally seen the light. Falling for Ivanna wasn’t surprising.

But if he loved her so much, why had he mated with me first, only to openly flaunt his affair with her afterward?

I wandered the streets in a daze, memories of the past three years flooding my mind. The weight of Alpha Patrick’s betrayal pressed heavily on my chest, and I could feel my wolf stirring in the back of my mind, a low growl of pain and confusion.

She doesn’t deserve this, my wolf murmured, her voice weak but defiant.

I didn’t know how to respond. All I knew was that the Alpha I thought I loved was gone, replaced by a cold, calculating wolf who seemed determined to break me.

# Chapter 3 - The Shattered Dance of Possession

When the car accident occurred, I wasn’t alone in the car—my senior from the dance company, Jesse Mendez, was with me. Jesse was two years ahead of me, and I had just started making a name for myself in the company.

I had saved up a year’s worth of my internship salary to ask Jesse to help me buy a watch. It was from a luxury brand, and Jesse mentioned he knew a sales associate who could get me one without the usual waitlist. In exchange, I had to help him train for a duet for two months—his partner had relapsed with an old injury, and he needed someone to practice with. I agreed.

For the next two months, on top of my own training, I spent an extra two hours every day practicing with Jesse. Two days before Alpha Patrick’s birthday, Jesse told me he had arranged with the sales associate, and we could go pick up the watch that day.

But on our way to the mall, the accident happened. Jesse was immediately taken away by his family, while I lay unconscious in the hospital for a full day and night before I woke up.

When I came to, Alpha Patrick looked at me with a strange expression and told me I’d never be able to dance again. Hearing that, I lost it, trying to stand up to prove I could. But my legs, encased in casts, wouldn’t budge. Any attempt to move sent sharp, searing pain through them.

From that day on, I became withdrawn, speaking very little. The only thing that gnawed at me was guilt over Jesse. He didn’t have to come with me that day. It was because he was helping me buy a gift for Alpha Patrick that he got caught in the accident.

Whenever I brought up Jesse, Alpha Patrick’s face would darken. He told me Jesse came from a prominent werewolf family in the city and would be fine—he had already been sent abroad for treatment.

Under Alpha Patrick’s meticulous care, I was discharged from the hospital. He brought me to his villa, hiring a housekeeper to look after me while he was at work. No matter how busy he was, he always came home to have dinner with me and made sure I had warm coffee in the morning.

He took care of me like this for three years, helping me let go of my obsession and convincing me to accept the mate bond, to live a simple, happy life together.

But in the past few days, Alpha Patrick’s personality had changed drastically, hitting me like a bolt out of the blue. I was caught completely off guard, unable to make sense of what was happening.

When I returned home, drenched from the rain, I was in a daze. I wanted to go to my room and change my clothes. But when I opened the door, Alpha Patrick was there, and my computer was still on.

He had gone through my email history. He knew I was still in touch with Jesse. Jesse’s rehabilitation abroad was going well, and I wanted to ask if there was still a chance for me to return to the stage.

Seeing me nervously checking my email for a reply, Alpha Patrick suddenly lunged at me like an enraged wolf, pinning me down on the bed. His eyes were bloodshot as he demanded, “Why? I’ve taken care of you for three years. We’re mated now, and you’re still thinking about going abroad to find Jesse?”

His Alpha tone was sharp, cutting through the air like a command I couldn’t ignore. The weight of his dominance pressed down on me, making it hard to breathe.

“Alpha Patrick,” I whispered, my voice trembling, “I just wanted to know if I could dance again. That’s all.”

But he didn’t seem to hear me. His grip tightened, his Alpha aura suffocating as he growled, “You’re mine, Roselyn. You don’t need to dance. You don’t need Jesse. You only need me.”

The words echoed in my mind, a cruel reminder of the bond we shared—a bond that now felt more like a chain. My wolf stirred in the back of my mind, a low whimper of pain and confusion.

She doesn’t deserve this, my wolf murmured, her voice weak but defiant.

I didn’t know how to respond. All I knew was that the Alpha I thought I loved was gone, replaced by a cold, possessive wolf who seemed determined to break me.

# Chapter 4 - A Storm of Misunderstanding and Control

I think Alpha Patrick must have lost his mind. I just wanted to ask Jesse about my rehabilitation—what did he mean by going abroad to find him?I tried to break free from his grip, but the harder I struggled, the tighter he held...

He really is such a good kid, he always means well. Although Chris is a sweetheart, let’s just say he is a little socially awkward. He struggled making friends, even in preschool he generally kept to himself. So you can imagine my excitement the one day he came home from school and said he made a new friend. I was so proud of him, this was a big step for the little guy. Even though he was only 7 I thought it was great that he finally was getting along with another kid.

Ever since we moved Chris had been struggling even more than normal. Maybe it was the new environment that he wasn’t used to or maybe it was the whole “not fitting in” thing. Hearing crying and sniffling in the middle of the night became the normal for a few weeks. It truly broke my heart. But hearing about this friend Chris made, maybe it would help him to get better. He really did deserve to be happy. We had downsized and moved to a smaller town because I lost my job. My wife Alyssa was now the sole breadwinner. While that was not ideal the best I could do now was to be a good father and husband while I looked for a new job. 

The day Chris came home to tell me about his new friend I was browsing the internet searching for a new job. It had been another unsuccessful search. Chris busted through the front door out of breath. 

“Daddy!! I did it! I made a friend! His name is Richie! He is the coolest! He has this super awesome Yo-yo that he showed me! DAD…I NEED IT FOR CHRISTMAS!!” 

I laughed and said “Alright buddy slow it down it’s only September! But tell me more about this new friend you made.”

“Dad he is so funny, everyone at school loves him and I know you will too!”

“Well DUDE he is gonna have to come by one day so we can all eat pizza and watch some wrestling!”

“OH MY GOSH THAT WILL BE SO AWESOME!!”

Chris excitedly ran to his room and I yelled down the hall “Get started on your homework and let me know if you need any help!” 

I haven’t been this happy in weeks. As a dad and husband you just want your family to be happy. After seeing the look on my son’s face, I couldn’t help but to smile from ear to ear. When my wife came home I couldn’t wait to tell her the news. I know it may not sound like the biggest deal to you but that little boy is our world and seeing him down in the dumps really crushed us. Alyssa was just as excited as I was that Chris seemed like he had finally settled in. She went to his room to hear the news straight from him. I was sitting there eavesdropping when I heard Alyssa yell out “Babe?!” In a worried voice. 

I made my way towards Chris’ room and once I got through the door my wife was pointing at Chris. With a smile on her face she said “Honey, who is this big boy and what has he done with our little baby?!” 

Chris chuckled and said “It’s still me Ma, I just wanna look cool like Richie!” Chris was digging through his closet trying to find his favorite Ninja Turtle sweatshirt.

That night before bed my wife and I shared a look. We were happy, the first time we’ve been happy since we had to move.
We shared a kiss and went to bed.

For the next week or so Chris would come home as happy as can be. He would tell me about what he was learning in school and how Richie was just the “bestest” friend. He would tell me about all the new toys Richie had and how he would let Chris play with them. I told Chris if they ever planned on hanging out outside of school I would need to meet his parents. Chris said he knows that but not to worry because Richie told him his parents said they weren’t allowed to hang outside of school. I thought that was strange but just chalked it up to Richie’s parents being strict. When I mentioned to Alyssa about Richie not being able to hang outside of school she told me not to worry about it. She told me Chris was happy, WE were happy, and things were finally going smooth. She was right, Chris was fitting in and our home life as a family was great because of it.

As the school year went on I did notice something. It was pretty obvious because we were tight on cash, ya know due to the whole “jobless” thing. Chris would come home from school and almost weekly would have some sort of new toy he was playing with. A hot wheels car, Hess truck, airplane, wrestler, basketball. All things we didn’t buy him. Whenever I asked him about it he would always tell me the same thing. “Richie let me borrow it!” While I didn’t think it was necessarily strange for kids to share toys. I did think it was strange that it was almost every week. Where is Richie getting these toys. It was a relatively small town and to my knowledge it wasn’t a particularly wealthy area, so I doubted someone could afford all these toys.

When I brought up the toy situation with Alyssa she did seem a bit concerned. She was wondering the same thing I was. Where were these toys coming from.

“Okay this is gonna sound bad. Do you think Chris is taking these toys from the school or maybe even a student? Is Richie even real?” As the words left my mouth I realize it sounded much worse than what I had imagined. Chris was a bit of a different kid, sure. But he wasn’t a liar. At least I didn’t think so. Maybe I was jumping to conclusions. Take a look from my perspective though. We are hearing all these amazing things about “Richie”. Chris has never once mentioned him coming over, sleeping over, or even going over to Richie’s house. He didn’t talk about any other friends or students. He came home with a different toy almost weekly and always had the same excuse as to how he got it.

Alyssa looked at me with worried eyes. “God, I hope not. Things were finally starting to look up.”

“Well I am going to ask him about it and see what he says.”

As I made my way down the stairs to Chris’ room I thought I heard something. It sounded like muffled talking coming from his room but I couldn’t quite make out what was being said. I stopped in my tracks and thought for a second. What if Chris was struggling so much to fit in he made Richie up. What if Richie is what Chris wants a friend to be. What If Richie is Chris’ imaginary friend. My heart sank. I hoped that wasn’t the case but that would certainly explain some things. The lack of other friends, the fact that Chris never asked if Richie could come over, and now the talking. What if Chris was talking to his imaginary friend. What do I say, what do I do? Will this just be a phase? I didn’t have the answers. Standing around in the hallway wasn’t going to get me any either. I knocked on Chris’ door and walked inside.

“Hey dude, how’s school going?”

“It’s soooo good dad”

“Oh yeah why’s that? Let me guess, Richie?” I said with a forced smile

“Yeah! He is the best! He is always giving me stuff, like these toys!”

“I wanted to ask you about that Chris, are you um, are you sure Richie is giving you these toys?”

“Whatcha mean daddy?”

“Are you taking them from the school maybe? Another kid? You know, just borrowing them of course.”

Chris sat there for a second and seemed to be thinking. “No dad, Richie is giving me these toys. I told you that! What did ya forget or something?” He started giggling.

I smiled at him and thought about how happy he was. I gave him a big hug and left his room. I spent the whole night just thinking to myself, what am I gonna do about this? 

It had been a few days since my little talk with Chris. He hasn’t mentioned Richie any more than usual and he hasn’t come home with any new toys. I had finally had luck with job searching. Funny enough as I was scrolling through endless pages I came across a job listing at Chris’ school. It was for a janitor. I know it doesn’t sound like the most glorious job but I knew any amount of extra income would help. I applied and quickly received an email from the school to set up an interview for the next day. I knew Alyssa would be happy and I figured Chris would be too. Even though I would be working, at least it was at his school where I could see him throughout the day. If I’m being honest a little piece of me was eager to see if “Richie” was in fact a real kid and not some made up imaginary friend. 

I waited on the front porch to meet Chris as he got off the bus. We lived close to the school but just far enough away that he still required a bus. As Chris got off the bus I can see he had his head down. I met him in the street and asked what was wrong. When he looked at me I could tell he had been crying. He hadn’t cried in weeks, it had me worried.

“Chris what happened?! Are you okay?”

“No.”

“Tell me what’s wrong kiddo.”

“It’s Richie dad, he is leaving. He said he was moving and today was his last day.” He said as tears started to stream down his face.

“Oh man, I’m so sorry buddy. Come here.” I hugged him tight. I took his backpack off his shoulders and we continued towards the house. Chris didn’t leave his room for the rest of the night. He didn’t eat dinner. He just cried. When Alyssa came home I broke the news to her. She was upset but had hopes that Chris would be able to make some new friends. 

Alyssa was in the shower when I decided I would go check on Chris and say goodnight. I made my way down the stairs towards his room. I stopped moving when I heard Chris talking. I couldn’t quite make out what he was saying through the door but as I got closer to his room the words became more clear.

“C’mon Richie do you really have to go. We had so much fun. You are my best friend and I really wish you could just stay with me.”

Before I knocked on the door an odd feeling came over me. This all but proved that Richie wasn’t real. Who could he be talking to. He didn’t have a cell phone. Richie wasn’t in the house. I proceeded to knock on his door and enter the room. There was Chris, sitting on his bed, walkie-talkie in hand. Not knowing what else to say I asked him.

“Who are you talking to?”

“Richie, daddy, I was telling him I don’t want him to leave.”

“Richie gave that to you? Richie is real?”

“Richie is my friend dad, of course he is real.”

I took the walkie-talkie from his hand and pressed down the button.

“Hello!.. Who’s there?! … Is this Richie?! …Answer me!”

There was no answer. No noise from whoever had the other walkie talkie. Silence. I proceeded to ask Chris about Richie.

“Richie gave you this? Why? Does he live close by?”

“I dunno, he gave it to me a while ago. We talk on it all the time.”

That must’ve what I heard the other night. Chris was talking to Richie or whoever it was that had the other walkie-talkie. Richie must live close by. He has to be close to have a strong enough signal to talk to Chris. I took the walkie-talkie away from him. I kissed him on the head. Told him I loved him and that I would be taking him to school tomorrow. I didn’t even get to tell him that I was going to hopefully be working at his school. 

The next morning I made some eggs for me and Chris. I asked how he was feeling and he just shrugged. I assumed he was upset about Richie moving and he was angry that I took the walkie-talkie away. Regardless it was time to head to school. Once we parked I grabbed Chris from the backseat. He looked at me strangely.

“Dad whatcha doing? You’re supposed to drop me off.”

“I know bud but today is different! I may get a job at your school, I’m here to talk to your principal! I may become your new janitor! Now I know-“ I was cut off by Chris’ cries. He ran into the school with tears streaming down his face. Did he really not want me to work at the school? Was it embarrassing to have your dad here or was it embarrassing that I may be a janitor? Either way I hurried to the principal’s office, I didn’t want to be late for the interview. I walked into the office right on time and spoke to the secretary. 

“Hello, I’m here to see Mr. Golding. I have an interview today.”

“Ah yes, you must be here for the janitor position that opened up. I’m really gonna miss the old one.” She chuckled. “I really never met a sweeter man. Anyway right this way Mr. Golding is waiting for you inside.”

I walked into the office with my head held high. I needed this job so I was there to impress. Mr. Golding was seated behind the desk but stood up as I walked into. He reached out a hand and I graciously excepted.

“Hello Mr. Golding, it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to interview for this position.”

“Of course Mr. Williams thank you for coming for the interview so quickly. We need to fill the position ASAP. As you can guess a school can get quite messy.” 

“I could only imagine. My son, Chris is a 2nd grader here and he is always making some sort of mess.” 

“If I’m being honest Mr. Williams after looking over your resume you are definitely more than qualified to work here. You seem like a man with a good head on his shoulders, you were punctual, and if I’m being honest because Richard left us so suddenly we are a bit desperate to fill his position. So if you would like it the job is yours!”

A giant smile spread across my face. The tension instantly released from my shoulders. I finally got another job. I was beyond happy. I quickly accepted the job without hesitiation.

“Thank you so much Mr. Golding! I promise you won’t regret this. You don’t understand how badly I needed this job!”

“Mr. Williams welcome aboard! I have the master keys here in this drawer let me just grab them.” Mr. Golding reached into his bottom drawer and pulled out a large set of keys. “Every key is labeled, the Janitor’s equipment is in a supply container in the back of the school. Thank you for taking the job on short notice!”

I couldn’t believe how fast of a process that was. I figured there was going to be at least 1 more interview. The fact that I could start right away was all the more reason to be excited. I looked at the keys in my hand while walking down the hallway and decided I wanted to check out how the previous Janitor kept the equipment. As I approached the supply container I froze in place. In my excitement of getting the job I completely brushed past the fact the Janitor’s name was Richard. This couldn’t be THE Richie that Chris was talking about, could it? No, that didn’t make any sense. It had to be a coincidence. Richard is a common name. Plus this was a school. No way none of the teachers or students didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. As I inserted the key into the lock my hands were shaking. I didn’t do a very good job of convincing myself that a grown man did not befriend my son. I twisted the key and removed the lock. 

What I found inside activated a concoction of feelings in me I had never felt at the same time. Rage, anguish, hate, nervousness, sadness all in one. The walls were lined with Children’s movie posters. Action figures spread about the small coffee table inside. Nerf guns laid on a dusty old couch. That’s when I saw it. A fucking walkie-talkie. The same walkie-talkie that Chris had the night before. Whoever this sick bastard was, was talking to my fucking 7 year old son. Tears started coming down my face like someone had turned on a faucet. I didn’t know what to do. I was frozen in time. I started ripping the place apart. I don’t know if it was out of anger or if I was looking for something specific. I did not care I was just moving. Toys, snacks, candy. What the fuck. The last drawer I opened I truly wish I hadn’t. I was staring down at pictures. Pictures of my son. My son and this sick fuck “Richie”. Taking selfies together like it was some sort of fucked up prom picture. I had to leave. I ran to Chris’ class picked him up and headed straight toward the exit. While holding my crying son, I began to breakdown. Chris whispered in my ear.

“You’ll never be as cool as Richie.”

Kendu is a memecoin that is focused entirely on community, we do not pay KOLs or rely on any ""team"", we all push in all directions, to build Kendu both as a brand and a coin. Kendu has an insane range of IRL products whilst also not slacking on the social media realm. Kendu is also extremely battle tested, redistribution can either make or break a community and it has made Kendu, we have been brought closer than ever. A lot of coins are gonna really take a massive hit when passing major milestones like 100 million mc, but not Kendu.

**Kendu's IRL Range**

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT

**Kendu's Social Media Efforts and Why Community is Everything**

Kendu is the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes, Pepe is the only other coin to ever manage this insane achievement. Certik rates Kendu's community at 92.85, whilst I haven't seen another coin above 90, never mind above 90 and under 25 million market cap. Community is the most important aspect and Kendu has it in bags, Kendu's twitter efforts rival the very best and our Reddit efforts are unparalleled. Check any memecoin subreddit and you will see Kendu everywhere. Due to these efforts, there will be so much FOMO at the first sign of green since everyone knows about Kendu, we seen this when we pumped to 40 million the other week. It is very hard on a communities morale during these tough and trying times, however Kendu's morale is not dampened. We push hard no matter the outside market conditions because we know any work now just adds fuel to the fire. The fact that Kendu is producing an unparalleled level of IRL products whilst also maintaining an insanely strong social media presence is unheard of, we are really upping the game forever. An IRL community is gonna be a key factor due to AI and bot usage rampant on social media, an IRL community is **Proof Of Humanity**.

**Some Final Thoughts**

Join the Kendu community, we are outworking all other projects right now and we all know what happens to the most hardworking communities...... they moon..... Shib, Doge and Pepe all had die hard communities, there was nothing special about them, they just worked incredibly hard. This is NFA but Kendu has absolutely 0 risk at these levels and a hell of a lot of potential upside. My advice is to at least join our telegram and get a feel for the community, ask questions and just get involved. You literally have nothing to lose but a lot of money and connections to gain. I personally am all in on Kendu because I don't see a reason to own anything else, Kendu dominates all metrics

Let me explain. When you get a link from a site that actually operates in your industry, it does more than boost your rankings. It builds your authority. It sends qualified traffic. And it tells Google, “Hey, this site knows its stuff.”

A backlink from a coffee blog to your SaaS brand? Meh. A backlink from a leading Digital Marketing/SaaS/Tech blog? That’s SEO gold.

Google isn’t just counting links anymore. It’s looking at context. Relevance. Authority. That’s why niche-relevant links beat random high-DR links every single time.

And here’s the kicker: you don’t need hundreds of them. A handful of strategic, niche-aligned backlinks can outrank sites swimming in generic links.",0,1751639237.0,linkbuilding,1,0.5,False
1lrk1ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/1lrk1ot/shipping_container_cargo_area_terminal_b_softlock/,Shipping container / cargo area / Terminal B softlock solution,"Just ran into this issue and it took me a while to figure out. Posting this in case anyone else gets stuck. 

1. How to get stuck

Succeed on jumping to grab your jacket and be low on health with no healing items. You will now be in the cargo area with seemingly the only escape gated behind a conversation that damages you.

2. How to fix it

Firstly wait until 10pm. The quickest way to do this is to spam read a book. Interacting with cases on the notepad then spamming '1' and 'enter' gets this done in under 2 minutes. Worst case spam talk to Kim, it's slower but still passes the time.

1lrk1le,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lrk1le/should_you_choose_the_brentwood_ts213w_coffee/,Should You Choose the Brentwood TS-213W Coffee Maker for Everyday Use,"Brewing coffee every morning is a ritual I refuse to compromise on. Having gone through various coffee makers over the years, I recently tried the Brentwood TS-213W, and it has been a mix of satisfaction and a few notable quirks. This compact, 4-cup drip coffee machine promised simplicity, and it mostly delivered on that front. As someone who steers towards user-friendly appliances for daily use, I thought it worth sharing my hands-on experience. 

**Design and Build Quality**  

This coffee maker boasts a minimalist design in white, which fits well in smaller kitchens or office break rooms. The lightweight 2.4-pound frame makes it incredibly convenient to move around, though it does feel less sturdy compared to heavier machines I’ve owned. Its compact dimensions (8""D x 7""W x 10""H) save counter space, a boon for cramped spaces. However, the white exterior can be a magnet for coffee splashes, making regular cleaning necessary.  

Speaking of cleaning, the inclusion of a reusable mesh filter is both environmentally friendly and cost-saving. I’ve been using the reusable filter daily, and it eliminates the cycle of buying and discarding paper filters. On the flip side, the filter’s mesh requires diligent cleaning—failure to do so can quickly lead to clogged coffee oil residues.  

**Ease of Use**  

Operating the Brentwood TS-213W is refreshingly straightforward. The manual power button setup means fewer complications. Simply add water (there’s a transparent water level indicator for accuracy), measure the grounds using the included scooper, and hit the brew button. As someone who isn’t keen on fiddling with multiple settings in the morning, this no-fuss functionality is delightful.  

The warming plate feature does a great job of keeping my coffee hot for a short while, but don’t expect your coffee to stay piping hot for hours. For a mid-morning refill, I found myself needing to reheat my brew in the microwave.  

**Upsides**  
- Reusable mesh filter saves costs on disposable filters.
- Compact size makes it ideal for small kitchens or office spaces.  
- Transparent water level indicator ensures precise measurements.
- Lightweight and portable for mobility.

**Performance: Brew Quality Matters**  

I’ve brewed all kinds of coffee using this machine—from dark roast to breakfast blends. The 4-cup capacity is ideal for solo drinkers or small households; however, coffee aficionados looking for an artisanal brew might find the extraction a bit underwhelming.  

This is mainly due to its manual settings without advanced brewing controls. Grind size and coffee-to-water ratios greatly influence the flavor outcome. I noticed that coarse grounds result in a smoother cup, while finer grinds tended to leave sludge at the bottom. The embedded water filter does an average job, but hard water users might spot minor deposits in the reservoir over time.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The lightweight build can feel flimsy for some users.  
- Keeping the white exterior clean can be a challenge.  
- Brewer performance is inconsistent with finer ground coffee.  

**Competing Products**  

Having tested other compact machines, I couldn’t help but compare this to more robust options like the Black+Decker Brew ‘n Go single-serve coffee maker. While the Brentwood TS-213W offers multi-cup brewing, the Brew ‘n Go’s stainless steel travel mug compatibility feels more versatile for on-the-go lifestyles. Similarly, Mr. Coffee’s 5-cup switch coffee maker has better heat retention thanks to its advanced warming plate, but it lacks the Brentwood’s reusable filter efficiency.  

In terms of pure affordability, the Brentwood unit outshines pricier competitors such as Keurig units. However, premium Keurig machines offer pre-infusion technology for bolder flavor, which this product does not.  

**Value for Money**  

For its price, the coffee maker is a practical option for anyone seeking an entry-level, manual drip machine. It lacks premium aesthetics or high-tech brewing features, but you’re paying for simplicity and efficiency. If ease of use and compactness are your top priorities, the affordable design adequately serves those needs. Families or work-from-home individuals who drink modest coffee quantities will find it a decent investment for everyday brews.

So I’m wondering how do you tell if someone is a scammer? I tried to place my first purchase, and Venmo or Zelle is strongly preferred apparently. When I asked for Paypal G&S I was blocked by this one seller immediately.

Like I get it if someone says “no” I will def respect that, you can read through my comments history and see for yourself I’m a huge fan of boundaries… HOWEVER, why block me? I didn’t even get the chance to respond and say “ok I understand your point and wish to move forward with the transaction” or alternatively “ok I understand your point and do not wish to move fwd w the transaction”… which to me IS a red flag 🚩

So idk, how do you transact in usa? I have a collection of authentic bags but live in florida. I’ve had a lipstick melt/spill in chanel bag before. I have 2 dogs and a savannah cat. 1 or 2 good rep bags would come in handy for my day to day.

I (30s) have been in my current workplace which is small, familiar and relaxed for around half a year, and have been trying to be more of “myself” after years of masking extremely hard at my last workplace. In that context, I would never share anything personal and definitely never any weaknesses.

So today I was having coffee with two coworkers in their 50s (male and female) who were lamenting getting older and sort of poking me about how soon I will start to feel the effect of getting older as well and will have to make an effort to take care of my body more to avoid aches and pains. I smiled and said that yeah I wish, I started having really bad back pain at 20 and had to start weight training several days a week to be able to function. My female coworker kind of scoffed and said “I guess we all have different interests” and I shot back that “I wouldn’t say it was an *interest*, I did it because it helped me be pain free. Thankfully it went away after a while.”

But wtf, she called me a boring person for taking care of my back pain? Was that an overshare? I felt like I shared such a small thing about my past but her reaction made me feel like it would better to back to my old work persona who has never had a headache in her life…",20,1751638757.0,adhdwomen,26,0.89,False

1lrjumt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1lrjumt/for_new_middle_school_and_high_school_teachers/,For New Middle School and High School Teachers.,"Abit of advice from a 2nd year High school teacher in the UK. I also have an NPQLBC which in the Uk stands for. National Professional qualification for Leadership in Behaviour and Culture of schools. So everything I’m suggesting here is based on solid information evidence which I know for a fact does works in the Uk setting. As rightly been pointed out by US teachers some may not based on certain restrictions. 

And what I have listed here is honestly a small number of things I did to turn around my classroom, based on 100 different ways and advice I was offered; the job is about taking different things, seeing what can fit for you, and developing your own style. 

If I could say one extra thing, try asking other members of your team if they would be comfortable with you observing a lesson for 15 minutes—a great way to get new ideas, see what works for them, and decide if it’s something you could include.

So, if you’re new — UK, US, wherever — best thing you can do is unlearn most of what they told you in training. A lot of it’s more about pleasing parents than helping kids grow and giving the what they need.

Here’s what’s actually helped me survive and now properly enjoy this job:

1) “How do I start with classroom management?”

It actually starts before the lesson even begins. Loads of new teachers don’t realise this, but the way kids enter your classroom sets the tone. Get that wrong, and it’s hard to claw it back.

What I do (and what works): line them up outside, wait for silence. Not fake silence — proper silence. Then let them in one by one, directing them where to sit. Have a starter on the board and make it clear they’re to do it in silence. Praise the ones who get straight on:
🗣 “Sophie’s doing her starter quietly — ready to learn!”
That sort of thing builds the calm you want.

And don’t let anything slide early on — even whispers. If they go against your first clear instruction and you let it go, they’ll keep pushing.


2) “How do I build relationships with students?”

At first — you don’t. Not in the “matey” sense anyway. First, they need to know you’re in charge and you mean what you say.

Be professional, take questions, share a little bit about yourself — but stay in teacher mode.

The biggest key to trust? Consistency.
If you say they’ve got a detention, follow through. If you say there’s a reward, deliver it.

Little things help too — 5-minute brain breaks where you chat with them about life, music, football. Saying hi when you see them outside class. I do a monthly tea/coffee station — cheap and simple, but they love it.


3) “How do I manage behaviour effectively?”

So here’s the system most schools in the UK use and it works very well, and it works wherever — UK, US, anywhere — even if your school doesn’t have much centralised behaviour support. So I’ve tailored it to a more US system as if you teach in the Uk you’ll already have your school’s Centralised policy, but form what I gather Centralised behaviour isn’t a common practice in the US. 

It’s called the C system, and the “C” stands for Choices — because we want students to understand their behaviour is a choice. We’re not punishing them for being kids — we’re holding them accountable for decisions they’ve made. It’s about responsibility, not punishment.

That said, we always make REASONABLE adjustments for pupils with additional needs. That might mean adapting how we approach warnings or interventions — but the overall structure still applies. Clear expectations, fair consequences.

Here’s how it works:
	•	C1 – First warning: quiet word or reminder.
	•	C2 – Second warning: choice made again → log it, parent phone call/email.
	•	C3 – Third choice: detention. Follow through, no exceptions.

Kids need to know where the line is. And equally important — praise good choices.
Publicly celebrate when students turn it around or stay on task.

As for wall charts? Ignore the people saying they’re “harmful”. If a child has chosen to behave in a way that earns a warning, they’re not too shy to see their name on the board. It’s not about shaming — it’s about visibility and accountability. Same as praise should be visible too. You don’t hold a child accountable they’ll never learn to take it. That’s why it’s so important. 

4) “How do I keep students engaged?”

They’ve told you cold calling is bad. It’s not. Doing it badly is bad.

Don’t just shout a name and expect brilliance. That just causes panic.

What you do is give them mini whiteboards. Say something like,
🗣 “In five minutes, I’ll be asking a question — get ready.”
Give thinking time, they write answers, then pick someone to share.
No panic. Everyone’s involved. It works wonders.


(Hack)
If you don’t have mini whiteboards you can always use some document wallets and put some paper in you also have somewhere store a pen too. 


5) “What’s the best way to teach?”

💡 It’s not the Smartboard. Turn it off. Unless you’re using it for your visualiser, just don’t bother.

Reading off slides? Bores them. Bores you. Nothing lands.

Best tools: whiteboard and pen. Get up there, explain stuff yourself. Talk it through, scribble, make it messy and human. If you need your notes, keep them on paper — not on a slide.

Use your document camera to model tasks. Go through questions live. Let them see your thinking process. It makes a massive difference. They feel like you’re in it with them, not just telling them what to do.


6) “How should I lay out the classroom?”

Rows.

Ignore anyone who told you otherwise.

Group tables = chat, distraction, chaos. Rows help with behaviour, attention, and they’re proven to support better learning outcomes.

Start the year with rows. Once you’ve nailed routines, you can adapt later if you really need to.


It’s just a job.

And yes, it can feel like your whole life sometimes. But remember — you’re not their therapist, their rescuer, or their best mate.

You’re the adult that shows up, holds them to high standards, and gives them structure — which is exactly what a lot of them are crying out for deep down.

Some come from tough homes. Be kind. Be compassionate. But don’t drop your standards. They need someone who believes in them enough to expect more, not less.

Now some of these I know a few teachers may have turned their head at which is understandable and if anything is unclear just ask and I’ll probably be able to go into more detail or provide any evidence to support anything. ",12,1751638672.0,Teachers,19,0.71,False

For context, I should mention that I'm in my mid-60s, and when I was dating back in the late 1970s and in the 1980s, there were no computers, no Internet, no social media, and no such thing as smart phones.

Put another way, men and women either had use a landline telephone (attached to the wall inside their house) to communicate, or we had to actually go out on dates and spend time with one another in person to get to know each other.

Technology (phones, but also social media) was simply not an issue in relationships.

* Technology did not help people get to know one another, and by the same token, it did not stand in the way of people getting to know each other.
* Because they did not exist, phones did not help create trust, and they did not contribute to breaking down trust.

**Now that phones exist, and because we can control access to our phones with passwords, they have, for many people, become a sort of litmus test, or standard, of whether one is trustworthy, committed to a relationship, or acting suspiciously.**

Keep in mind that the same thing can be said for texting and for social media.

* For example, some people ask, ""Should I be concerned that he has not responded to my text for 45 minutes?"" or ""he has left me on delivered, what does that mean?""
* Others may ask, ""he's not following my Instagram account, but he's looking at the Instagram account of his ex-girlfriend and liking her posts... should I be worried that he might be betray me?""

In other words, for someone like me, who grew up without this kind of technology, it would seem that relationships have the *potential* to become ***much more complicated because of phones and the Internet.***

Now that we have established the background, I can share my own personal views about the specific issues involved in phones and privacy.

As you read the commentary below, please keep in mind that a phone is a personal device, no different really than a personal diary, or a journal where one records one’s personal thoughts... and perhaps these thoughts are not meant to be shared with other people.

Every human being on earth has a right to that privacy.  And no one has the right to *deny* someone else that privacy. 

*But people do have the right to evaluate a partner's honesty and integrity by the way they handle their phone* ***in the context of the overall relationship.***

**Case 1**.  I recently read a post here on Reddit by a young woman who said that she just met this very nice guy... they had gone out on a few dates, he was very respectful and very kind, and they got along very well.  This young woman reported that one day, they were talking about different issues, and she asked him whether it would be OK for her to look at his phone.  And the guy said no, that he would not allow her to look at his phone.

She asked him why, and he said that it was because he had a right to privacy, they did not know each other very well, and for him, this was a very important boundary.

Many people were very quick to say that she should dump the guy, because it was obvious he ""could not be trusted.""

But was that really the case, that he ""could not be trusted""?

The young woman gave **no indication** that she had any reason to suspect him of anything. They barely even knew each other.  And of course, he had done absolutely nothing to give her any reason that she should be suspicious of him or his behavior.

So, in fact, there was *no evidence* that he ""could not be trusted.""

Quite the contrary. This was a young guy who believed that it was important in relationships to have boundaries, and that these boundaries be respected.  He did not ask her if it was OK if he looked at **her** phone, for example, and it's quite possible that the thought never even occurred to him.

What that told me was that this young man had a very strong sense of who he was, and what he expected from a partner. *To my mind, those are very admirable qualities and indicate to me that he believed that clarity was extremely important in establishing a relationship with a woman.*

And because of that, in my opinion, there was absolutely no reason for this young lady to end the relationship.  I suggested that she get to know him better as a human being, and not come to any premature judgments about him just because he appreciates boundaries and clear communication.  I suggested that one day, when they had developed a deep trust for one another, then it was completely conceivable that he would share his phone with her. She thought that was a reasonable idea.

**Case 2**.  Another post I read here on Reddit, by another young woman, presented a somewhat different scenario.

She had been in a relationship with her boyfriend for a few years.  They had been living together for a while... she had met his parents, he had met her parents, and things were generally going very well.

This young woman reported that one day she had noticed that her boyfriend was becoming a bit distant from her... she could not describe it, but said that something ""felt off.""

She noticed that he was not always coming home from work at the usual time;  when she asked him about this, he said to her that she, the young woman, was just being ""insecure"" and ""not to worry about it.""

The young woman reported that this behavior was unusual, and she said that she felt a bit disrespected by that, and it caused her  -- understandably -- to be a little suspicious.

She further reported that her boyfriend had suddenly started leaving his phone face down on the coffee table, which was a change from before, when he had always left her phone face up, so the screen could be visible.

Se also observed that whenever he got up from the sofa to go to the kitchen, he would take his phone with him; previously, he had simply left his phone on the coffee table where it was.

*Her question was whether everyone thought that her boyfriend was behaving oddly, and whether she should be concerned about this change in his behavior.*

She specifically asked whether she should ask him if she could look at his phone, and what she should do if he said no.

Again, most people said immediately that she should dump him and terminate the relationship.

**In my opinion, her boyfriend's behavior was indeed suspicious, and she had every reason to be concerned about what he was up to, and in particular, what might be on his phone that he was fearful of her seeing.**

Of course, terminating the relationship over her boyfriend's behavior (coming home late sometimes, being distant, and his new way of handling his phone) was an option for her.

But was it the only option?

I asked this woman how her boyfriend's behavior made her feel; she responded that her boyfriend's behavior towards his phone made her feel afraid, sad, and unsure about what to do.

I asked this young woman whether she thought she could tolerate this feeling, and she made it very clear that she could not, because it made her very uncomfortable.

I asked this young woman whether she wanted to try to preserve the relationship with her boyfriend... whether she might want to have a conversation with him about his behavior.  I offered her a few suggestions about how to frame a conversation with him.

She messaged me a week later to let me know that she did indeed have had a conversation with him, and that it did not go well.

She thus decided to break up with her boyfriend.  He admitted that he was texting other girls, and that she had found images on his phone that she found objectionable and inappropriate.

She told me that her trust in him had been irrevocably broken, and that she did not think she could ever feel about him the same way again.

**In summary, the phone** ***by itself*** **is not, in my opinion, necessarily a reliable or** ***foolproof*** **way of determining whether a partner is trustworthy.**

Human behavior is what we all should be looking at in the first instance, and in that respect, access to a partner's phone -- specifically, whether a partner is willing to share his phone, or has reason to *conceal* what is on his phone -- *can indeed* be a useful indicator of whether trust in a relationship has been broken.",1,1751638536.0,u_Expensive_Magician97,0,1.0,False
