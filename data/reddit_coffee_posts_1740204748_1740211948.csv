1ivdytj,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1ivdytj/im_done_trying_to_trust_people_and_being_myself/,i'm done trying to trust people and being myself,"warning: long read

for a long time, i was someone who barely spoke to anyone and never told anyone about any personal problems i had. like i told basically no one about even suicide attempts. i just didn't trust anyone, i didn't think that they'd ever understand. where i am, mental health is still not something that there's widespread awareness about. then i went to therapy for my depression. i slowly started opening up to people. i realised that i sometimes needed people i could rely on. i told some friends about problems i had. i never connected with any of my friends but i could tell that they were good people, that they at least cared for me, even if i always felt like i didn't fit in.

i began college. and looking back, i was way too trusting of people. i joined a friend group. honestly i never really felt that they were my friends, i was always left out of conversation, and the shit they talked about was so boring. but i still tried to be myself. in front of them and everyone. i tried to pretend as little as possible. and that's where the problems began. i sometimes get depressed. and those times, i literally have nothing to talk about. i go very quiet. sometimes i'm even suicidal. once i broke down crying because i thought my friends weren't there. and i saw that they cared that i was crying, or at least were concerned. i told some of them that i had depression and shit like this happens sometimes. big mistake. i told one girl that i'd attempted suicide the day before and that's why i felt so horrible. bigger mistake. i opened up to her because it looked like she cared. but i didn't know her, not really. and i feel so stupid for opening up about anything.

i need my coffee. i'm quite dependent on it. it's because my depression makes me insanely numb and disconnected. also one of my meds makes me sleepy sometimes. i've tried. going without it for during my holidays. it was alright, but i still felt insanely disconnected from everything and myself (i'm talking even after the withdrawal symptoms were gone). once class started again, i needed it to function, basically. once me and my ""friends"" went out. and i needed my coffee, so i had to ask them an insane amount. and they were like ""you're really addicted, huh"". and then i fucking opened up to some of them that i had this need. and i didn't think it was a big deal. because i'm fucking stupid. because i thought that it's similar to someone saying ""yeah, i'm coughing a lot, it's cuz i have a cold"".

a few days passed and then one of the girls came up to me and had this long conversation with me. she started being really weird with me, asking if i had mental health problems and shit (i'd never talked about this to her btw), started fucking interrogating me. and i was honest. because like i said, i was trying to open up myself to people. that was my state of mind. she basically told me that they thought i was weird, that i was ""showing off"" about my mental health problems (whatever that's supposed to mean) and that i talked about my emotions too much. i never really talked about it to any of them, except for the instances i mentioned here. and even that was too much, apparently. i asked her why she was telling me all this and she said she pitied me. oh and one of those people i told i had depression to that day (again, out of necessity) apparently told this girl that i said that. and that he thought it was weird. okay, i don't care if some people think i'm weird or don't like me. but if you don't, just don't interact with me i guess? i thought that he'd at least have the decency to not tell anyone. i basically went home and realised that i didn't even like them that much and this was clearly them telling me i didn't belong. i told the girl that, and she sent one message saying sorry. i didn't respond. and none of them even tried to talk to me again. honestly i'm glad. and i know this could have gone a lot worse. i don't think they care enough to spread rumours or talk shit about me, i'm pretty sure they've forgotten already.

i, on the other hand, have been on a journey about who the fuck i have been the past few months. i've trusted people way too fucking much. trusted them to be empathetic, trusted them to be able to understand my problems, trusted them to keep confidence, trusted them to be able to accept someone who's a little different. and i think i've also pathologised myself to an extent, linking everything to neurodivergence or depression. i think that i'm going back to closing myself the fuck off from everyone. i want to detach myself emotionally from most people, like i used to. i don't want to open up to anyone except someone i've known for a long time, and someone who has similar problems or at least has the understanding. i'm going back to being someone who pretends. yeah it's gonna be exhausting, but people are even more exhausting. i can't let me give a shit about everything and everyone, it's ended horribly for me (though i know well that it could have been a lot fucking worse) and i felt so damn disconnected from myself. the way i now see it, yeah if someone judges people for having mental health problems, they're kind of a shitty person. and i understand that a lot of people use that as a litmus test to find if they're worth spending time with. but guess what? i don't have a choice. opening up to people is a choice. participating in society is not. there are all kinds of people in society, shallow, hypocritical and close minded. maybe most of them are. if i want to not be miserable here, i should be able to fit in to an extent. and if that means i can't be myself and have to pretend sometimes, so be it. if i don't, i'm gonna have an even tougher time here. and i already fucking hate it. 

oh and if i didn't say it, yeah i'm diagnosed with mild autism. and i've always had problems socialising, and i feel like this was a part of that but if this isn't relevant feel free to remove it i guess ",1,1740211799.0,aspergers,0,1.0,False

I haven't been too consistent with the gym in the last year but the year before I've hit the gym 5x a week for weight training involving regular weight lifting, Olympic weightlifting, kettle bell workouts and a little bit of body weight exercises which put on a lot of muscle mass on me. At the same time ate a protein based diet. Yet I still had the problem that I could not get rid of body fat and my muscles kept on growing under my fat making me look even bigger than I was before. It's a little bit frustrating seeing how my lifestyle is pretty much a goal for a lot of people yet I do not get the results that I wish I would see (which is to be leaner and have a lower body fat percentage). Meanwhile my husbands only change to his diet was not overeating his meals and listening to his fullness and it dropped his bodyweight/fat pretty noticable. I don't really know what to do about it and would appreciate any tips.

I am 30 and 6 months pregnant with my first. I got married in August 2024 and fell pregnant in October 2024. 
Lately, my best friend and one of my bridesmaids has been ghosting me and I have no idea why. 
We were inseparable she helped with my wedding and knew all my plans and was excited - it’s not like I’m 20 years old, like at 30 starting a family is not unreasonable and my husband and I are very financially stable and we have both worked towards this goal. 
I asked her about why she never replies and she tell me that she’s just too busy but then actively talks to and sees our other friends. I questioned that and she shut me down immediately and said we need space and hopefully we can get back to where we were. 
I can’t pin point anything I’ve down in particular - I was very open about wanting to try for a baby after the wedding and did a lot of hormonal prep and tracking of my cycle to make my chances the best possible. 
She is now organising morning coffee dates with everyone else in our group and leaving me out. 
My husband thinks it is jealousy - what do I do? 
I’m kind of spiralling with all the hormones and emotions from pregnancy and now this on top of it.

I've been a barista in Sac for the better half of 6 years and have gotten to know a ton of the owners and supervisors from different shops. These are the worst shops in town:




Pachamama: 

Chief Retail Officer Cruz Conrad will specifically higher younger, Christian cis-gender female baristas because according to their HR ppl, he finds them ""easier to manipulate"". He's brushed off sexual harassment accusations on multiple occasions, rarely hires POCs, and made the general environment of working at a coffee shop extremely hostile and unsafe. Cruz has gone out of his way to target non-binary and queer baristas and blame them for the shortcomings of different Pacha locations, when it creally boils down to his awful judgement and poor management skills.




Temple Coffee:

 As a company, they refused to allow they're baristas to wear masks during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 until they were pressured by employees. During the peak of BLM protests, they wouldn't allow employees to wear any pins related to the crisis until pressured by the public, at which point they made an all talk no action statement that they supported BLM. They also had a poor track record of hiring primarily white baristas, hiring POCs only as tokens of ""diversity"" for their shops.

The owner, Sean, has sexually harassed and touched multiple employees on the no-longer-ocurring annual camping trips Temple used to host. The coffee chain also first began with Sean fetishization of SEA culture, literally naming the coffee shop ""Temple"" and using ""Dharma"" and ""Three Pillars"" as names for coffees, despite their sacredness to Hinduism i.e naming a coffee blend ""The Bible"" and another ""The Ten Commandments"". Bottom-line: gross straight white male behaviour and appropriation.




Goodside Coffee:

The owner, Chuck, is hands-down one of the worst people in the Sac coffee business. Glares at children and even threatingly goes over to them and makes them move. Treats customers like chores unless they're European/white and conventionally attractive. Multiple baristas have spoken about just how awful it is working with him, including tolerating the following types of conversations and behaviour:

- Disrespecting Trans people and mocking their pronouns
- Fetishizing people of different ethnic backgrounds
- Slamming equipment and doors when upset
- Yelling and cursing at employees when upset
- Constantly in an awful mood and refusing to acknowledge anyone if they say ""good morning"" or ""how are you

<<TRIGGER WARNING>>
- Telling a story about how when he was in his early 20s he tried to date an underage girl but her dad didn't let him. He apparently only told this story to his female co-workers and told the story as though he was in the right...

It would seem that the baristas that he hires are always amazing people, but as it were, Chuck himself is a POS. From speaking with multiple coffee shop owners and baristas, the entire Sacramento coffee community avoids him and his shop like the plague.



Milka Coffee:

In case anyone hasn't figured it out yet: charging customers more for coffee because it ""pays for baristas' tips"" is actually a scam. Baristas' get paid $1 above minimum wage and then $21/hr on weekends. For some insight, baristas' usually make between $28-$40/hour with tips depending on the time of year and the day of the week. They don't actually pay their baristas what they deserve, hence the extremely high turnover rate with new baristas' being hired every 5-6 months.



If anyone would like to add on their experiences with these shops or others whether as baristas or customers, please feel free to add onto this post. At a point in time where everything is so expensive and the country is going to shit, we need to be extremely mindful of who we give our extremely hard-earned money to.

Im 24 and moving into my first apartment within the next few months. I live in a major city with HCOL and I wont have any roommates. I just was hoping I might get an extra pair of eyes on my budget. 

The only debt I have is my car. The apartment I am renting is approximately 780 sq feet. I do not eat out and I am pretty good at sticking to a budget. After security deposits/moving costs/activation fees/etc etc, I will have approximately $9000 in savings. 

I net $4370 per month. 

- Rent: $1600 (rounded up and includes community fee, pest control, trash, internet, and water) 
- Renters insurance: $20
- Utilities: $250
- Car payment: $438
- Car insurance: $240
- Phone bill: $80
- Credit: $100 (used only for gas and always payed off monthly) 
- Subscriptions: $33 (netflix, hulu, etc)
- Groceries: $400 (rounded up, includes groceries and personal care/toiletries/etc)
- Savings: $800
- Small misc costs: $100 (the random coffee, trinket, etc)

This leaves about $300 per month for any additional spending that might come up, or for fun/spending money, which is a lot for me as I usually spend about $150 per month on fun things (my hobbies are pretty cheap thankfully lol)

Does it look like Im forgetting anything to budget for that I need to account for? Based on this, will I be struggling a lot? I dont want to forget anything and have a bad surprise later.

1ivdfm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ivdfm8/the_town_that_vanished_at_midnight/,The Town That Vanished At Midnight,"
I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe I just need someone to believe me. Maybe I need to get it out of my head before it eats me alive.

There’s a town that shouldn’t exist. It’s not on any map, no records, nothing just a name whispered between truckers and late-night travelers. Black Hollow.

No one plans to go there. It just shows up.

If you’re ever driving down Route 29 past midnight, you might see a road that wasn’t there before. A cracked asphalt path winding into the fog, with an old wooden sign barely holding on. The letters are faded, peeling. But if you look close enough, you’ll see it.

Welcome to Black Hollow.

I made the mistake of taking that road.

I was driving through the backroads, running low on gas, GPS acting up. It was one of those nights where the world feels empty, where you go too long without seeing another pair of headlights, and it starts messing with your head.

Then I saw it.

The turnoff.

A gas station’s neon glow barely visible through the fog. I figured, why not? Fill up the tank, grab a coffee, keep moving.

But as soon as I turned onto that road, something felt… off. The air got thick, like it was pressing down on me. The fog swallowed my car whole, my headlights barely cutting through. My radio crackled, then died.

Then my phone screen glitched out.

That should’ve been my first warning.

The town looked frozen in time—rows of old houses, a diner, a gas station. But no streetlights. No sound. Just stillness.

Yet, the gas station lights were on.

I pulled in, relieved, but the place was empty. No attendant, no cars, no sound. The pumps were ancient, the kind with rolling numbers instead of a screen.

And then I heard it.

A whisper. Right behind me.

I spun around, heart hammering. Nothing. Just my own shadow stretching too long under the flickering station light.

I hurried inside. The bell above the door jingled, but the store was empty. Shelves were stocked, but covered in dust. It was like everything had been waiting for someone to show up.

And then I saw the newspaper on the counter.

""BLACK HOLLOW MISSING AGAIN. TOWN DISAPPEARS FOR 30TH YEAR IN A ROW.""

The date? Exactly one year ago.

My stomach dropped. I turned to run.....

And that’s when I saw them.

Figures. Standing outside. Watching me. Their faces weren’t right—blurry, like looking at a reflection in broken glass.

My pulse pounded in my ears. The store lights flickered, and for a split second, I saw their faces clearly.

They weren’t strangers.

They were people I’d seen before. On missing posters. On the news. Faces of people who had vanished.

And then.....

The lights went out.

I don’t remember running to my car, but I must have. My tires screeched as I tore down that road, the town stretching on like it didn’t want to let me go. The fog thickened, twisting like it was alive.

And then I saw the sign again. But this time, the words had changed.

“WELCOME TO BLACK HOLLOW. YOU CAN CHECK IN, BUT YOU CAN’T CHECK OUT.”

Then—blackness.

I woke up on the side of Route 29. My car was parked neatly on the shoulder, gas tank full. My phone worked again. The time on the dash? 12:30 AM.

Like nothing had happened.

But when I got home, I checked the missing persons reports.

And there, in the latest update…..

My face.

It had only been a few hours since I left that town. But the report said I had been missing for a year.

I don’t know how much time I lost in that place. But I know one thing for sure.

Black Hollow is real.

And it’s still out there, waiting.

I should have never turned down that road.

So if you’re ever driving on Route 29 past midnight…..

Keep going.

Because if you see the turnoff, it means Black Hollow has already chosen you.

I am 36M in Mumbai and I am looking to achieve below goals:

- Daily 30 mins workout
- 3 hrs of learning (Coding -leetcode, reading etc)
- 8 hrs of weekend start up work

I tried this with couple of ppl but they leave inbetween so I think you need reward based framework to keep yourself motivated.

Here is the framework:

1. Each day you get 2 pts to complete a goal
2. We can build notion page to follow the points and status
3. You can redeem this points when it becomes 20 points, redeeming can be between each other and need to come up exciting stuffs like

- Giving good food
- Meet up in real over coffee
- Become a lisning buddy
- Running/walking together 
- idk we need to think more around this what can keep us motivated.

1ivdb7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForceRecruits/comments/1ivdb7u/my_meps_experience_in_2025_22m/,My MEPS experience in 2025 (22M),"Just forewarning, this is going to be a long post. However I will try to be as in-depth as possible for my experience doing the physical at Los Angeles MEPS. Please keep in mind I will only be talking about the physical as I did my ASVAB and TAPAS at an earlier date. I also did not swear in as I decided to switch branches last minute (yes my recruiter was insanely upset with me). I passed everything but need a waiver for my eyesight which I was informed by the doctor that it will pass considering my measurements.

**IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. I WAS NERVOUS FOR MY FIRST TIME AT MEPS SO PLEASE ASK AWAY. I'D LIKE TO EASE ANY NERVOUSNESS OR CONFUSION YOU MAY HAVE.**

If anyone is wondering, what you should pack in a backpack to bring to MEPS is:

\- Tooth brush and toothpaste

\- Business Casual clothes 

\- Cable charger

\- Hoodie/sweater

\- Undergarments and socks

\- Book (Optional)

\- Decent shoes (just make sure you'll be comfortable wearing them all day)

\*\* PLEASE REMEMBER TO BRING YOUR **DRIVER'S LICENSE/ID** AND YOUR **SOCIAL SECURITY CARD** \*\*

So I got to the hotel near MEPS around 1730, where I went into an office where I was issued a room key and 2 meal tickets for dinner and breakfast the next day. There was a schedule on the wall that listed this:

Check in: 1500-2000

Dinner: 1700-2100

Curfew: 2200

Wake up: 0300-0330

Breakfast: 0400

Depart: 0430

After this you basically have free time until 2200. Dinner for me was basically a self-serve burgers and fries with water and pink lemonade as beverages. I would try to sleep around 2000-2100 though just to get as much sleep as possible. Please note you will have a same-gendered roommate who can be from any branch (mine was Navy).

So I woke up with my roommate at 0250, got dressed and went downstairs for breakfast. You will turn in your keycard and your meal tickets here. Breakfast consisted of self-serve scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, toast, pastries, and cereal. You will have orange juice, water, coffee, and apple juice as beverages. At 0430 we all got into a line and were ushered into the bus to take us to MEPS. The ride was around 10 minutes long and as we got there we basically stood outside for like 20 minutes (why you should bring a hoodie).

After a while a MEPS representative came out and separated us into 3 groups: 1) I believe were individuals needing testing, 2) individuals who needed to do the physical (I was in this group), and 3) individuals who had a ship date. we were then put in 5 equal lines and we were briefed. For the next 10 minutes we were basically told to give the representative any weapons or we would not be able to attend MEPS, to have all hoodies and hats off, to get rid of all jewelry and watches, and to take off all our belts. After that, we were all ushered in 5 at a time to go through the scanner and put our items through the scanner. After the scan we went to a baggage room to put away all items except our ID, social security card, phone, and book if we brought one. We then went to our individual branches' offices, turned in our phones, and got issued a sticker to place on our shirts.

  
We then stood in lines separated by branches in the downstairs waiting area to check in and go upstairs. Upstairs we waited in another line to check in and were asked to go into a room for a medical brief. It is here you will undergo a 20ish minute medical brief, perform a breathalyzer test, and receive a paper you will carry with you until you are done with MEPS. This paper will basically contain your results of every medical test as you complete them. Following the brief, you will now have the opportunity to independently complete all medical tests. There is basically one big waiting area with a bunch of chairs, and different rooms for different tests. The tests I performed and descriptions are as follows:

***- Blood Pressure/Pulse rate:*** Doctor straps a cuff to your arm and records blood pressure and heart rate. Takes like 2 seconds.

***- Urinealysis:*** For males we were called in 5 at a time. There are 5 urinals right next to each other, no walls for privacy. You will be asked to pull down your pants AND undergarments down to your knees to fill up a cup. After you are done you will dress yourself and hand your paper and urine cup to a worker within the bathroom through a sliding window. If you cannot immediately urinate, you will be asked to go back outside and hydrate yourself until you can.

***- Bloodwork:*** You will be seated down on a chair with an arm rest. The worker will tourniquette your arm, stick a needle in, and draw blood for around 20-30 seconds. After you will have a cotton swab taped to your arm until you finish all the tests. (Side note for those scared of needles, you will be allowed to close your eyes and it really does not hurt all too bad. Just remember if millions of recruits before you have done this, **YOU CAN TOO.**)

***- Audio:*** We were sat in 1 of 2 rooms containing 6 people max. We are given a headset and a small button to press every time you hear a beep. The test will be 5-10 minutes long. Please note that after you finish the test there will just be silence. You will not be told the test is complete. I remember freaking out because I thought I was failing but no)

***- Vision:*** We were sat in a room with a bunch of machines to look into without any eyewear. You will first be asked to read numbers with a background to determine if you have any color blindness (just google ""Color Blindness Test"" on Google). You will then be asked to look into a machine which will contain letters on lines, getting smaller and smaller as the lines go down (basically a standard eye test at any optometrist). You will then look into a separate machine that will analyze your eyes and I believe determine your prescription and any astigmatism you may have.

***- Height and Weight:*** You will be asked to stand against a wall to determine your height. You will then step on a scale which will measure your weight. Since I believe I didn't meet the requirements, my neck and waist at my belly button was taped. I did need to lift up my shirt for him to tape my waist. I am not sure if they make ALL applicants get taped.

***- Doctor:*** Here is the most invasive and extensive test at MEPS. Please also note you will be extensively briefed on this portion during the initial medical brief. First I was sat in a chair and asked some questions about my medical history. After that I was asked to strip all clothes except my underwear and sat on a seat, typical of any seat you will find in a doctor's office. He checked my heart rate and listened to my lungs as I took deep breaths in and out. He also asked me to open my mouth and say ""Ah"" as he looked in. He also checked my ears. Then I was asked to stand up and perform a bunch of movements. First I had my arms to the side and front as he pressed down. I was also asked to raise my arms and clap them together. He then asked me to orient my hands in a bunch of ways while opening and closing my fists. I was then asked to touch my hands to the floor and had my back touched to check for scoliosis. I was then asked to squat 3 times and performed the duck walk, barefoot, across the room and back (maybe around 10 feet total) while barefoot. I was also asked to walk barefoot on my tippy toes and on my heels across the room and back. Finally, I was asked to take off my underwear. You will pull back your foreskin for inspection. You will have one finger placed on your genitalia and be asked to cough. Finally you will be asked to turn around, spread your cheeks as the doctor inspects your anus. **PLEASE NOTE NOTHING SHOULD BE INSERTED INTO YOU AT ANY TIME.** After this test is complete you will put all your clothes back and, if finished with all tests, be asked to check out with the front desk upstairs.

You will then go downstairs and go visit your branch's office. Here you will be given your final basic brief where you will be able to receive your phones. Note that when I checked my phone it was 1330. As you wait for your recruiter (or yellow cab since Air Force got that money), you can go upstairs to receieve lunch which will be a sandwich, cookies, chips, and a beverage. When your ride gets to MEPS, you will check out with the office who will escort you to the baggage room to reclaim your backpack and any items. You will then go to the front desk downstairs to check out and discard your sticker so that you can leave.

Here I will list some basic tips and information for people just to manage expectations:

***\*\* KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT WHEN TALKING TO STAFF. REMEMBER THAT NO MATTER HOW FRIENDLY THE STAFF MAY BE, THEY ARE THERE TO DISQUALIFY YOU. DO NOT DISQUALIFY YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU OVERSHARED SOMETHING \*\****

\- Drink lots of water at breakfast. Any hesitancy of urinating in an environment like MEPS will be eased by you needing to go bad.

\- Do not masturbate the night before. You will be sent home as there will be too much protein in your urine sample.

\- Avoid caffeine in the morning before going to MEPS. this will affect your blood pressure and heartbeat. Also don't be stupid and drink alcohol the night before or the day of. Also AVOID MOUTHWASH. This can affect your breathalyzer test.

\- No one will yell at you, but they will be stern and get upset with you if you don't follow directions **EXACTLY.** One person got upset at me that I picked up a pen to sign the paper since ""She didn't say to pick up the pen."" Most of the people working there are nice and chill though, I just think that one lady was just mean.

\- Get your ears cleaned. You will be sent home if they are too dirty.

\- Testing will be LOOOOOONG. Bring a book if you can as it can take a long time for applicants to finish testing at a station you need.

\- Don't wear a white T-shirt. It is considered an undergarment and you will be asked to go home. 

\- Treat everyone at MEPS with respect. Respond with Yes Sir/Ma'am and No Sir/Ma'am.

Finally, I'd like to offer some anecdotal advice. Please don't stress. Like I said earlier with the blood test if millions of recruits have done this before, YOU CAN TOO. I went in with an open attitude and honestly had a good time talking with other recruits and asking them about their branch, why they decided to join, etc. MEPS is really not scary as long as you manage your expectations. Just listen to your recruiter and you will be OK. Just remember what you are there for and you will get through. Best of luck to anyone going to MEPS.

I’m trying to make sense of it all and need tips on how to move forward.,"Ever since I(F22) was small my mom has always been kind of an odd woman. She hasn’t had a boyfriend since my dad separated from her. She hasn’t had many friends. Her company is the number one priority in her life. She’d prioritize it over me and my siblings well being.

I remember how she’d wake up at 6AM and head to work. She wouldn’t come home until 11PM. Therefore nobody really took care of me and my siblings. We did whatever we wanted. We stayed home from school whenever we wanted. She didn’t care, she just cared about her company. We’d walk with holes in our shoes, holes in our clothes, and there’d be no food at home. She wouldn’t notice nor care really because the company was most important. She sees a lot of pride in this part of her life. How she didn’t need help from anyone and successfully raised 3 kids. Only she didn’t. We starved and froze and suffered a lot. She didn’t care though, her company flourished.

Now when I’ve grown up I realize the mess that was my childhood, but I keep seeing some horrible sides of my mom.

She loves to talk bad behind people’s backs. I try to make sense of it and give her tips. She must be talking bad because she wants it right? No, she just wants to talk bad and paint a bad picture of a person that wronged her. I don’t even know if what she’s saying is true. I know that during all my life she talked bad about my dad but much of it is showing to be lies.

She won’t ever see when she’s wrong. She’ll blow up and scream rather than say sorry. She’ll put the blame on others and never take accountability for anything.

She doesn’t seem to have much empathy. She’ll never be able to understand why a person view something a certain way or feel a certain way. She’ll try to fake it but it’s never genuine. She never tells someone she loves them or is proud of them.

She doesn’t prioritize her wellbeing. Her company is the number one priority. When I had to move home again recently I came home and there was mold in the coffee machine and sink. The house smelled putrid and I could barely breathe because of all the dust. I’m asthmatic so dust affects me a lot.

She doesn’t take help from anyone. If she does it’ll be on her terms, but they often include infantilizing the other person so much that they don’t want to help anymore. Imagine telling a grown adult man that want to help you throw out furniture that he can drive the car, that’s it. You’ll do everything else. It’s infantilizing.

I can go on but these are those I notice everyday since I’ve moved home. Every single day she’s talking bad about others, infantilizing me, and is generally a very negative person to be around.

Are these narcissistic behaviors? How can I proceed? Our relationship is about to snap but the thing is that I’m dependent on her for now. It’d be terrible for it to snap now. I’d appreciate any tips!

Right now I handle it by reading books and telling her to not talk to me when I read. Every morning I read and when she comes home from work I read. So we don’t talk much. The few times we do she always tries to talk bad about someone. Very very negative.",1,1740208828.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

I am u/soyajeenah and I am the founder and moderator of this subreddit. I consume A TON of media and I often find myself looking past the ""main characters"" on screen admiring the people in the background instead. I'll see an attractive person sitting courtside at an NBA game or in the background of a TV show and think about them for a week straight wishing I knew their name.

Over the past few years I've seen a lot of posts online, primarily on TikTok, where people are asking for help identifying a cute person they met at a coffee shop in passing or a hottie they made out with in a club on vacation and there's a lot of success in finding these people.

There is an abundant community of people online who love sleuthing and helping people discover things they've long been in search for! I decided to create this community for a couple of reasons. The first reason being because I noticed there's a shortage of communities on reddit for finding people and I felt that I could help to fill that void in a way that is safe and fun!

The second reason is because I have yet again set my eyes on another ""cutie in the back"" and I would love to have some help in discovering who he is (Second post with his photo is loading I promise!). As I said before, I want this community to be a safe space and I want the members of this community to be respectful so it's important to note that this community is intended to find the identity of unidentified background actors, musicians, athletes, models and celebrities who have willingly put themselves in the public eye. This community is NOT for locating people seen in public spaces.

Although posting photos of people in public spaces is legal in the US, this community believes people in public spaces have a right to privacy when it comes to unknowingly being posted online. 

I hope to build a community that can be used as an effective tool and not as a weapon. So, if you relate to some of the things I've said or if you're an aspiring super sleuth or even if you just like looking at eye candy every now and then, I welcome you! Let's have some fun looking for cuties in the back.",1,1740208823.0,CutieInTheBack,0,1.0,False

Here is a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nbmhwPzD20) that hopefully sparks your imagination, click for a the [game description](https://karottenrambo.github.io/PocketPlanetNotes/Pocket%20Planet/PublishedPages/Pocket%20Planet%20Survival%20Description.html)

After my first [full project](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1if0jci/4_years_4000k_hours_800/), I want to address the most important question first, is it marketable?

The hollow planet concept with seamless in/out transitions is my unique hook I tried to build a game around. - even if you are not interested in joining the project, early feedback on the overall concept would be highly appreciated.

This is the [Contract](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ivccd2/revshare_contract_template/) I'm planning to use and is currently open for refinements.

This revenue share model is surely not everyone's cup of coffee, but it offers several advantages if you believe in in me and the concept.

I am convinced about the unique potential, in the worst case I would finish this game on my own. But I am also aware that I have a bit of a blind eye on the art side and will not achieve the level of quality that is needed to survive on a highly competitive market. Due to real life responsibilities, I can invest roughly 15 hours a week into the project. So the next logical step is, to find developers with similar ambitions and create something bigger together!

Who am i looking for? Here are the [development Milestones](https://karottenrambo.github.io/PocketPlanetNotes/Pocket%20Planet/PublishedPages/Development%20Milestones.html). At this point of development, (gameplay beta) I only need other unity developers. Experience with unity ECS/DOTS is pretty much a requirement, the learning curve is quite steep and it cannot be picked up within a weekend.

When the gameplay beta is ready, and some technical evaluations are done, I would also need and art director who can create low poly models and animations.

When the general setting/artstyle is set, other roles like video editor, marketing specialist would be open - but at this point, there will be an new post in INAT.

1ivd6m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1ivd6m7/how_to_use_seasonal_marketing_campaigns_to/,How to Use Seasonal Marketing Campaigns to Attract New Dental Patients,"Seasonal marketing is a powerful way to connect with potential patients at just the right time. People are often more open to new services during certain seasons, holidays, or events, making it the perfect opportunity for dental practices to attract new patients. By crafting creative and engaging seasonal campaigns, you can increase awareness, build trust, and encourage more people to book an appointment.

Here’s how to use seasonal marketing campaigns effectively to bring in new dental patients.

# 1. Leverage Major Holidays and Events

Holidays and special occasions are a great time to reach potential patients. People tend to be more engaged with promotions and offers during these times, making it easier to grab their attention.

* **Valentine’s Day** – Offer a ""Bright Smile for Your Valentine"" discount on teeth whitening services.
* **Back-to-School Season** – Promote dental check-ups for kids with a ""Start the School Year with a Healthy Smile"" campaign.
* **Halloween** – Educate parents and children about cavity prevention after consuming sugary treats.
* **New Year’s Resolutions** – Encourage people to prioritize their oral health with a “New Year, New Smile” special offer.

By aligning your marketing efforts with holidays, you can create fun and engaging campaigns that capture people’s interest.

# 2. Use Seasonal Themes in Your Content Marketing

Content marketing is a fantastic way to educate potential patients while promoting your services. Incorporate seasonal themes in your blog posts, social media updates, and email newsletters.

* **Spring Cleaning for Your Teeth** – Emphasize the importance of professional cleanings as part of a fresh start for the season.
* **Summer Smile Makeovers** – Promote cosmetic dentistry options to help patients feel more confident in their vacation photos.
* **Winter Wellness Tips** – Share oral health tips to help patients protect their teeth during colder months.

Creating valuable, seasonally relevant content positions your practice as a trusted resource while keeping your audience engaged.

# 3. Offer Limited-Time Promotions

A sense of urgency can encourage new patients to take action. Consider offering limited-time promotions based on the season.

* Discounted teeth whitening in summer to help patients achieve a brighter smile for vacations.
* Family dental check-up packages in the fall to prepare for the school year.
* Holiday-themed referral discounts to encourage patients to bring in friends and family.

These time-sensitive offers can drive more people to book an appointment before the promotion ends.

# 4. Engage with Social Media Campaigns

Social media is a great platform to showcase seasonal promotions and interact with your audience. Use creative content to capture attention and encourage engagement.

* Run holiday-themed contests where participants share their best “holiday smile” photos.
* Create interactive polls about favorite seasonal treats and share dental care tips.
* Post behind-the-scenes videos of your team celebrating seasonal events.

Engaging social media content increases visibility and helps build a connection with potential patients.

# 5. Partner with Local Businesses and Events

Collaborating with other local businesses can help expand your reach and attract new patients. Consider setting up pop-up booths at seasonal community events or offering exclusive deals for customers of nearby businesses.

* Partner with a local coffee shop to provide discounts on teeth whitening for coffee lovers.
* Sponsor a local holiday event and distribute branded goodie bags with dental care products.
* Work with fitness centers in January to promote overall wellness, including oral health.

These partnerships create more exposure for your practice and encourage new patients to consider your services.

# Final Thoughts

Seasonal marketing campaigns are a fantastic way to attract new dental patients and keep your practice thriving year-round. By leveraging holidays, content marketing, promotions, social media engagement, and local partnerships, you can create compelling campaigns that capture attention and drive new appointments. If you want to grow your practice, implementing the **best dental advertising** strategies through seasonal marketing is a smart and effective approach.",1,1740208477.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False
1ivd6l2,https://www.reddit.com/r/australian/comments/1ivd6l2/australia_is_full_of_sht_a_guide_to_blaming/,Australia Is Full (Of Sh*t): A Guide to Blaming Immigrants for Everything,"Australia is, of course, full. Just absolutely *bursting at the seams*. No more room. Not a square inch left. Never mind the fact that you can drive for seven hours in any direction and see nothing but emus giving you side-eye. This place is packed. Sardine tin. Completely uninhabitable thanks to a few extra people arriving on planes.

And naturally, every single problem this nation faces: housing crisis, wage stagnation, underfunded hospitals, potholes, your toast landing butter-side down is entirely, *entirely* the fault of immigrants. Nothing to do with property hoarders buying their seventeenth investment unit. Nothing to do with wages being smothered like a possum under a Bunnings truck. Nothing to do with governments that could spend money fixing things but choose instead to build carparks no one asked for and submarines that don’t exist. No, it’s the fault of the bloke named Raj, who moved here last year and is currently pulling a 16-hour shift making your kebab.

Ah, yes, kebabs. That *perfectly* Australian dish. Just like coffee, Chinese takeaway, or literally anything you’ve ever eaten that isn’t Weet-Bix and sadness. But sure, mate. Tell us more about how migrants don’t “assimilate.”

And it’s not just jobs, oh no. We are told, in increasingly sweaty Facebook rants, that migrants are also the reason why you can’t afford a house. Not the tax loopholes. Not the banks handing out million-dollar loans like Monopoly money. Not the fact that every second person you meet is a “property investor” with the moral compass of a Bond villain. No, it’s absolutely the fault of a refugee family pooling their money to afford a single rental while an entire suburb is being bought up by some bloke named Gavin in a linen shirt.

Of course, all these immigrants also overload the roads, the hospitals, and the schools. Because *before* they got here, Australia was a utopia of gleaming highways, fully staffed hospitals, and functioning public transport. That’s what we all remember, right? The golden age of 1993, when every train ran on time, rent was twenty bucks, and nurses were paid in Fabergé eggs?

And here’s the real kicker: the loudest voices complaining about migration also seem to be the ones least interested in doing the jobs that migrants do. You know, those minor inconveniences like *keeping the entire country running*. Picking fruit. Building roads. Driving trucks. Nursing. Teaching. The people who scream “F\*\*\* OFF, WE’RE FULL” never seem to be in a hurry to scrub toilets or harvest tomatoes in 40-degree heat, but the moment someone else does it, it’s “taking Aussie jobs.”

So next time some bloke at the pub starts grumbling about how migrants are the problem, ask him how many rental properties he owns. Ask if he’d like to work a shift in an understaffed hospital. Ask if he’d like to pick fruit for a sub-minimum wage while a billionaire supermarket exec makes his fifth trip to the Bahamas. Watch his eyes glaze over as he realises this entire conversation isn’t going the way he expected.

But sure, mate. Keep blaming the immigrants. That'll definitely fix everything.",0,1740208472.0,australian,38,0.38,False

I built *another* AI search engine. I know, I know, the world needs another one like it needs more crypto scams. But hear me out (or just scroll, I get it).

A while back, I had a ""brilliant"" idea for a startup that was going to revolutionize… something. It involved AI, naturally, and a whole lot of buzzwords. Fast forward a year, countless hours, and a concerning amount of caffeine, and... well, let's just say the revolution was more of a polite suggestion that no one listened to. The startup imploded spectacularly. Think Wile E. Coyote running off a cliff.

Left with a broken heart (and a slightly singed bank account), I decided to channel my existential dread into something...else. Something that wouldn't require a pitch deck or user acquisition strategy. Something...open source.

That's how ""RabbitHoles"" was born (link below!). It's an AI-powered knowledge explorer that helps you dive deep into any topic and visualize your research journey as an interactive mind map. Think of it as the Wikipedia wormhole, but with a slightly less depressing UI.

**Why build** ***another*** **search thing?**

Honestly, I wanted to learn, build something cool, and maybe, just maybe, create something genuinely useful for others. Plus, the idea of helping people lose themselves in fascinating topics felt like a good way to atone for my startup sins.

**Tech Stack:**

* Frontend: React, TypeScript, React Flow, Tailwind CSS
* Backend: Node.js, Express, Tavily, Google Gemini

It's not perfect (understatement of the year), and it probably won't replace Google anytime soon. But it *will* let you explore the connections between Da Vinci's mysteries, cosmic consciousness, and quantum entanglement (yes, that's one of the example maps).

I'm putting it out there in the open source world in the hope that others might find it interesting, contribute, or at least get a chuckle out of my post-startup coding journey.

Imagine AI swiftly transforming chaos into order during an emergency—like a superhero, but with a deep learning core instead of a cape.

Arizona State University (ASU) is pioneering the way with a $1.9 million grant to develop AI software for disaster response. With this tech, they aim to shave critical seconds off emergency response times and make smart resource allocations. ASU's Professor Paulo Shakarian leads the charge, focusing on using AI to predict the cascading effects of disasters, like a wildfire triggering a flood, which might then knock out power in an area. It’s all about seeing the dominoes before they fall.

Arizona's Division of Emergency Management director, Gabe Lavine, sees AI as a vital tool, especially with the public safety sector's ongoing staffing challenges. Think of AI as an ultra-efficient team member who doesn’t need coffee breaks.

Lavine emphasizes that AI will not replace human jobs but will fill vital gaps, ensuring that decisions are informed and timely, ultimately aiming to save lives and property. The project's completion on a three-year timeline ensures phased implementations every six months, so new capabilities are continually added.

With AI gaining ground in disaster response, the question remains: Is this tech the key to a safer future, or are we racing into unknown risks?

His head was thrown back in pleasure and he had one hand wrapped in her hair as he pushed her head up and down rapidly.
His eyes met mine when he heard my horrified gasp.
""Wait, let me... I know- it's not"" he reached for my arm.
""Don't touch me.""
""Jake..."" the redhead said as she got to her feet.
""Shut up"" I snarled at her and turned back to Jake ""Don't bother coming home.""
————————
Becca
A few days prior
""Hey Jake, are you almost home?"" I asked and propped the phone between my shoulder and ear so I could adjust our son on my hip.
""Sorry babe, I'm going to be late tonight. The client asked if we would take them out to dinner"" my husband replied.
""Oh,"" I tried to keep the disappointment out of my voice but failed ""All alright, I'll just put your plate in the fridge. How late do you think dinner will go?""
""I don't know, Becca"" he paused as a voice murmured in the background and then continued ""I'll be right there. Hey Becca, I've gotta go, they're waiting on me. Don't wait up, you and the baby need your rest.""
""Okay..."" he hung up before I could finish my sentence.
""Looks like it's just you and me tonight, T."" I said and bounced my 3-year-old son Tony a couple times. ""And sissy"" I added as his little sister kicked my bladder.
I rubbed my stomach absentmindedly and looked around the kitchen. Today had been the gender scan and I hadn't told Jake. I knew my husband wouldn't be able to get the time off of work because an important client was in town this week and he had been so stressed about how much of his time they were demanding. Not wanting to add to his stress, I had gone alone and planned on surprising him tonight with the news that we were having a little girl. I had baked a small cake for us and filled the inside with pink frosting and was going to present him with the cake and a picture of the scan right after dinner. As a partner at a prestigious law firm, it was not abnormal for Jake to have last-minute meetings. At 33, Jake was the youngest partner and because of that he said he had to work harder than everyone else.
I put away the lasagna, and cake, and took Tony upstairs for his bath.
We lived in a very comfortable 3 bedroom, 1.5 bath, 2 story house in a safe neighborhood outside of Boston. We had moved here 5 years ago right after we got married, and within a year we found out we were expecting Tony. I had spent my 21st birthday puking just like everyone else, only mine was morning sickness not a hangover.
After I had bathed Tony, I read him a bedtime story and tucked him in for the night. It was only 7p.m, so I still had plenty of time to tidy up and read a few chapters before heading to bed myself. I cleaned up the kitchen and stuck the scan back in my purse and then headed upstairs with my kindle.
I felt the bed dip and heard my husband chuckle as he slid into bed next to me.
""Fell asleep reading again?"" He asked quietly as he took my kindle off of my chest and set it on my bedside table.
""Guess so"" I murmured ""What time is it?""
""It's a little after 9"" He replied and gave me a smooch.
""How did it go?"" I asked between smooch.
""Fine, same as always they just need to feel like they're the most important thing in our world."" He smiled at me as I tried to blink away sleep. His hair was wet, and he looked tired.
""They're working you too hard."" I grumbled and snuggled into his chest as he laid back in bed.
""It won't always be like this."" He replied and then asked, ""How was Tony today?""
""He was good, he had morning preschool and then went to the store with me this afternoon.""
Jake smooched the top of my head and turned off the light.
The next morning, we both woke at the same time and began our usual morning routines. I grabbed Tony out of the crib, while Jake made coffee and then I made breakfast while he took a shower and got ready for work. There wasn't time to discuss the scan, but I asked if he could please try to be home for dinner tonight. He said he would do his best and gave us both a smooch before rushing out the door.
As I got Tony ready for school, I realized I really didn't want to wait to share the news with my husband until his work schedule allowed it. I was rarely difficult about his work schedule, but it was upsetting to face these milestones alone. I decided I would drop Tony off at school and then surprise Jake at work with the cake and scan.
After I dropped Tony off, I called for a cab to pick me up at the house; finding parking in the city was a nightmare and I didn't have a parking pass for the firm's garage. It didn't take long to get there. I thanked the driver as I slid out of the car with my cake in hand.
The guard in the lobby recognized me and waved me through with a smile. It had been a few months since I had last visited but before this pregnancy, I use to stop by for lunch with Jake at least once a week.
I bumped into one of his coworkers and friend, Ryan, on my way to Jake's office.
""Becca?"" he called out with a smile ""What are you doing here?""
""I have a surprise for Jake"" I smiled and lifted the cake box up.
""Lucky basta-rd!"" he joked.
""I'll tell him to save you a piece"" I replied and continued down the hall.
Maryanne, Jake's secretary, was sitting at her desk and gave me a bright smile when I approached.
""Good morning Mrs. Manning, I didn't know you were coming in this morning.""
""Good morning, Maryanne, it's a surprise. Is he busy?'
-
""He just finished with his first client and shouldn't have another call for thirty minutes."" She replied checking his schedule. ""Go right in!""
I gave a quick knock before opening the door. Jake was sitting at his desk staring at his computer screen. He had a very serious expression on his handsome face and his hair was slightly messed up, as if he had recently run his hands through it. He looked up at the intrusion, with an annoyed expression but it quickly fell away into a smile when he saw it was me.
""Becca, what are you doing here?"" He asked and stood up to greet me. At 6'1 he towered over my much smaller 5'5 frame.
""I couldn't wait until tonight to show you this."" I said and set the cake down on his desk and then stood on my tippy toes to give him a smooch.
""You brought me a cake?"" He asked and lifted an eyebrow.
""Actually, I baked you-us a cake last night.""
His face dropped a little.
""I'm sorry about dinner"" He started to say.
""Jake, I've never come to the office to lecture you and that's not why I'm here today"" I interrupted with my hand up. He nodded and waited for me to continue ""I had a doctor's appointment yesterday, and I didn't tell you because I knew you wouldn't be able to get the time off and then would just beat yourself up for it after.""
""Is everything okay with you and the baby?' He asked, looking alarmed.
""Of course, it was the 20-week scan."" I smiled and pulled the scan out of my purse ""I got to see our baby yesterday.""
""Oh, I wish I had been there... 20 weeks is the gender scan, isn't it?"" he asked as the news dawned on him ""So, you know what we are having?""
""Yep!""
""Are you going to tell me?"" He asked with a grin.
""Nope.""
""Becca...""
""But the cake will!"" I said with a giggle.
Jake laughed and pulled me into a hug.
""I love you Rebecca Manning"" he said.
""You better, Jacob Manning"" I teased.
A few minutes later we were hugging again, and Jake was loudly announcing to his office that he was going to be a girl dad. The office replied with mixed calls of congratulations, and Ryan called out that if our daughter looked anything like her mother Jake should get a lawyer on retainer now, and then told him he know a guy. Which made the entire office laugh.
As soon as we were alone in his office again, he pushed me up against the door and gave me a panty soaking smooch.
""Have I thanked you lately for making me the happiest man in the world, Rebecca"" he growled against my lips between smooch.
""Not in the last 48 hours"" I replied, breathlessly, as he nipped at my ear.
""I should rectify that immediately.""
""Maybe you should"" I moaned as his lips trailed down my neck and his teeth grazed my skin.
His phone ringing halted our almost office intercourse and he pushed away from me with a groan.
""I'm so sorry babe, this is my next appointment, I have to take this call"" he sat down and ran his hands through his hair looking frustrated.
""It's okay Jake, I'm the one who barged in."" I giggled ""but I will expect you to finish what you started tonight.""
""You can count on it."" He growled and his eyes darkened with his promise.
I blew him a smooch as he picked up the phone and stepped out of his office with a smile.
""Have a good afternoon, Maryanne.""
""You too, Mrs. Manning!"" She replied.
I was stopped a few more times on my way to elevator by people I knew from various office parties and by one of the other partners. They all wanted to congratulate me and ask about the pregnancy and tell me how much Jake brags about his family. Finally, after twenty minutes of small talk I made it down to the lobby where the guard asked me if I needed him to call a car for me.
""No, that's okay I can just use the app."" I replied and reached for my purse. I cursed quietly when I realized I had left it in Jake's office. ""Well, I can use the app after I go back upstairs and get my purse."" I said and laughed ""pregnancy brain is a real thing, Jerry.""
""Oh, I know"" he replied, ""by the time our 4th was coming I was worried Gloria might leave a baby somewhere."" He chuckled.
I laughed and got back on the elevator.
Maryanne wasn't at her desk when I got back to Jake's office. I hesitated at the door for a moment but decided that it would be less distracting for me to just slip in grab the purse and blow a smooch than to knock.
As the door was opening, I heard Maryanne call to me from down the hall
""Wait!""
I didn't need to worry about distracting Jake as it turned out, because he was plenty distracted by the pretty redhead that was on her knees with her lips wrapped around my husband's manhood while he reclined in his chair.
His head was thrown back in pleasure and he had one hand wrapped in her hair as he pushed her head up and down rapidly.
""Dirty bimbo"" he grunted, and she moaned.
His eyes met mine when he heard my horrified gasp.
""Becca..."" he choked out and the redhead pulled her mouth off of my husband with a little pop. She turned her head and licked her lips before smirking at me.
""You son of a bit-ch"" I snarled and stormed forward to grab my purse that was still sitting on his desk next to the cake box.
He jumped to his feet and tucked himself back into his pants while trying to form a sentence.
""Wait, let me... I know- it's not"" he reached for my arm.
""Don't touch me.""
""Jake..."" the redhead said as she got to her feet.
""Not now, Jessica"" he snapped.
""Excuse me?"" She huffed.
""Shut up"" I snarled at her and turned back to Jake ""Don't bother coming home.""
""Becca, give me a chance to explain."" He reached for me again with tears in his eyes.
""Just let her go Jake."" Jessica laughed, ""You can stay at my place, won't be the first time.""
""Bit-ch..."" I spun to face her.
""Jessica, shut up."" Jake snarled.
""Have you no shame? I'm pregnant with his second child and you are gloating about being the side chick?"" I scoffed.
""I'm not the side chick."" She huffed, indignantly and cross her arms under her very enhanced chest ""he just can't leave your fat a-ss because you got knocked up.""
""That's okay, he's all yours. My 'fat a-ss' and I wish you both all the best."" I side-stepped his hand and stormed out of his office.
""Have you lost your mind?"" I heard him roar as I slammed the door behind me.
The next few moments were a blur as I somehow managed to get to the elevator without letting anyone stop me. I wasn't sure if Jake was going to chase after me or not and didn't slow down for even a second to find out. In the lobby Jerry tried calling out to me that Mr. Manning had asked me to wait but I ignored him and ran outside.",1,1740206965.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1ivcrya,https://i.redd.it/wwjp33oh0nke1.jpeg,Decants haul (November 24-Feb 25),"

Leaving some noobish reviews from a guy who just wants to smell nice. From Delhi, so will give my impressions based on weather and then overall longevity.

Side notes: I work at an IT company. The compliments I get are from dudes I work with, as there are no ladies in the area where we sit, but dudes don't lie, so take that with a grain of salt.

1. **North Stag 3 Trois**: From Imran Bhai. I myself asked for an LV Imagination clone, just to get what's the foreign hype about. Look, let's be real, if you're from India, you've smelled this a good amount of times. It starts exactly like Vim dishsoap. Period. It stays like that for a good 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, there is a hint of Nestle ice tea, with the same Vim smell lingering on. Now of course I don't know what the OG smells like, but if it smells even remotely like this, then buy a decant or a sample, it's not a blind buy. As a summer freshie, sure it's going to stay. But with body chemistry and heat, it'll be noticeable to you for 1 hour max and people around you for an extra 1 hour. 5/10.

2. **Artisan Pure**: Imran Bhai. Another summer freshie, again it's Delhi, it's more warmer here than colder, like 4 months of cold vs 8 months of solid sun and heat. So a good freshie, solid for work. Smells similar to something later in this list on the dry down. 7/10. Good gym wear.

3. **Versace Pour Homme**: Imran Bhai. It may sound controversial or like fanboy stuff, but I think Versace is probably the best overall designer brand for a guy in Delhi. They cover effing every weather, day or night, doesn't matter, they have something for you. This one is an all-rounder. Smells like a shower gel you've used before. But lasts longer than a shower gel. No, it does not project. No, it might not be loud enough to get compliments. But damn it makes the person who wears this feel happy. It's a good office scent. Buy a few of these decants, carry them to work, spray 3-4 times a day, be happy. Starts like a shower gel, dries down like a nice Lux-type soap which stays. 8/10.

4. **Dylan Blue**: From Saheb. Again, Versace nailed it. Outta the park. If you like ADGs or your Sauvages or your BDCs, you will like this. You will wear this everyday. A colleague liked it so much he bought a 200ml bottle. It's that everyday scent. Again it's an EDT. Does not project much longer than 30-60 minutes in this weather. But damn it smells good to the person who wears it, and good to others who were near when it was sprayed on. Smokey, punchy, suit-like fragrance. Beautiful sharp opening, subtle dry down. Buy decants, keep them in bag, spray 2-3 times, you're good. A freshie but also good year round. 8.5/10.

5. **TDH Eau Intense Vetiver**: Saheb. Ah yes. A frag I don't like, but the people around me have. Look, I don't know wtf is vetiver or how to describe what it smells like, but this is something old school. A guy with a beard, who likes to wear black, seem mysterious, a guy who reminds a girl about her daddy issues in a good way because it smells like that dad. It's sharp, it projects, I will not wear this for office, but for a long late night drive from Delhi to Murthal for chai and paratha, sure it gets attention. Fresh spicy, good year round. My score 6/10. My buddies' score 9/10. Weird, I know.

6. **YSL Myself EDP**: Saheb. Yes. This is good. Very very good. It's a different good. A fruity freshy good. A flowery fruity freshie. It has this thing that you can smell it on you for a good amount of your day, because the opening and dry down are quite unique so it does not cause that olfactory fatigue. Great for office. Might be good for dates (idk I'm single can't say). The bros love it. Now the catch, I already have something that smells 90% similar but not as long-lasting as this one is. It's called Police To Be Tattoart For Him. It's very same, but Myself beats it in performance. But for the price, try the Police. 8.5/10.

7. **PdM Greenley**: Saheb. Ah the PdM wagon, heard so much about this brand. But it's nothing special. Don't get me wrong, it smells unique as in something different than other freshies, but it's not special. A different freshie as it's more apple-like instead of the whole bergamot train other freshies have. It lasts well on clothes. Good for spring and autumn (neither for summer or winter somehow). It works best if temp is around 15-30ish. 7/10.

8. **Rasasi Hawas Black**: Saheb. Look, just get the Armaf CDNIM. They are very very same. Even the performance based on what CDNIM you get will perform the same. Pineapple lemon, smoky. Don't use this on clothes though, the juice is kinda dense, skin is fine. It's mass appealing, nothing wrong with it, if you already have CDNIM, it can be skipped. If not, buy whichever is cheaper. 8/10. Wear it whenever, doesn't matter. It does its job as a dupe, the smell profile is basically on preference. Sharp opening, stays sharp throughout. Women like this more (based on my mom's and sisters' impression).

9. **Mancera Amore Caffé**: Well Scented. Okay time for winters. Look, this is exactly what a nice expensive bakery smells like. Coffee, vanilla, brownie-esque. It smells like you're wearing food. I wore it to office and a dude's like ""you're smelling like a brownie."" Now the problem, this is Delhi, and I work at an MNC. I leave home, I sit in a cab and travel for 100 minutes to work, work that has central heating/cooling. This needs a cold weather, this needs those chilly winds, this is not an office wear, or a car wear, this is like it's late, you're in Khan Market walking around in peak December January winter, it works then, otherwise I've always had a headache when I've worn it. And this stays on your clothes for days if that cloth is not washed and just hung around behind the door of your room. It smells awesome, it's strong, but no, not an everyday wear. It's more of a guilty pleasure. 8/10.

10. **Invictus Victory Elixir**: Well Scented. See this bridges the gap the Mancera one could not. It is also sweet, gourmandy (food), coconut, vanilla, but it's not like in-your-face strong, it's very balanced. Can be worn on a cold day at work, on a nice hoodie or linen shirt. It'll stay. It'll project. This is a good winter scent. 8.5/10.

11. **Eros Flame**: Well Scented. Versace, you beauty. Vanilla, with orange and lemon. Beautiful sweet woody dry down. Will last on clothes. A year-round fragrance if you're not trigger happy with the fragrance. I have Eros EDP but that is more sweeter vanilla while this is a fresher vanilla. Versace has you covered for the year, man. My friend told me it smelled like an Axe fragrance, but that's fine, iterations are common in fragrances. 9/10.

12. **ADG EDP**: Well Scented. Bottle not in picture as it's in my office bag. This one's opening smells like the dry down of Artisan Pure. It's kinda spicy weedy-ish smell. Artisan Pure, TDH EIV and this one are like same-same but different but still the same. Mass appealing, great for office. It does its job. All-rounder for year. 8/10.

13. **Viktor & Rolf Spicebomb Nightvision EDP**: Myntra. Got it on that extreme cheap V&R sale. I already have its bigger brother the Spicebomb Extreme, and while that is 9.5/10 winter frag, this is meh. Apple, with spices, no sweeter. Doesn't last long. Doesn't project. It might be a fake, I did match the batch code for its date, it seems legit, but it's passable. Get the Spicebomb Extreme instead. Can be worn everyday if again you're not trigger happy. 6/10.",4,1740206879.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,2,1.0,False

I was on S. Congress last Sunday and I saw so many beautiful mothers and hot dads walking with their sweet babies as they grabbed an  early morning coffee before the crowd arrived. Where in the world do you think these ladies found such men who {seemingly} love the dad life; and the married life simultaneously? Witty comments are appreciated.

1ivco3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/1ivco3g/chronic_illness_buddies_anyone/,Chronic illness buddies? Anyone?,"Hey everyone! I'm new here but not new to chronic illnesses. I feel like it's probably a common thing for the community, but you ever just feel alone and wish you had friends that had the same struggles as you? I mean of course I don't wish this on anyone, but sometimes it's nice to have someone who gets it, surely? I'm kind of an awkward introvert with extroverted tendencies on top of everything I go through health wise so that definitely doesn't help making friends any easier. I have a total of three friends that I've had since kindergarten and 2nd grade. I love them so much but none of them know the struggle. One lives far far away and she's a super important business woman so we play catch up monthly and see each other whenever she makes it back to visit. My other two friends are in the early-ish days of motherhood still and also live about an hour away. Other than them, I have my older sister who doubles as my bestie which I'm so fortunate to have such a dynamic, but again, not dealing with what I am and sometimes she gets motherly on me lol. Luckily she's still so supportive and understanding. I do have my husband whom I also consider my best friend and he has his own slew of health issues but not in the same way that I do, plus he works a lot busting his butt for us. I just wish I had someone similar to talk/message with, discuss things, and relate to. I felt desperate enough to look into apps to make friends but after awhile of fiddling with them and not finding any that have large enough chronic illness centered spaces, I gave up. So, I find myself here. Anyone want to be chronic illness besties? 😂 *I'm cringing* 😳

Some info about me:
•Name is Morgan.
•I'm 30 but my body feels like it's 80.
•Pronouns: She/Her
•Bi 🏳️‍🌈 💓💜💙
•Married to my highschool sweetheart of 16yrs.
•We have three hilarious children ages 11, 10, and 8.
•Dog mom (2) and cat mom (2) as well (love animals 🥰).
•Plant lover.
•I live in the dreaded Midwest.
•Before things got super tough, loved to travel and sight see.
•I have the same 4 comfort shows I watch regularly and outside of those, I love horror and comedy movies, true crime and documentaries are a staple, and unfortunately my guilty pleasure is crappy reality dating shows. 😳😂
•Neurodivergent brain from my pals inattentive ADHD and level 1 ASD.
•Very into life sim gaming and/or cozy gaming.
•My aesthetic is somewhere between alternative bisexual , cutesy hippie, comfy cute hobo, and pajamas that double as daily wear.
•Pretty sure Coffee is the only thing keeping me alive.
•My taste in music is vast and confusing. If I'm not hyperfixating on one artist or one song, my playlist is chaotic.
•Sarcasm and movie/TV references. Iykyk. That's all.

As far as my chronic illness storm, it's a real mixed bag! And I'm currently under the care of the Mayo Clinic (pretty recent still) by a team of doctors that believe I have some sort of mitochondrial disease/myopathy. That's yet to be confirmed but it is a strong possibility. I go back for a muscle biopsy and genetic testing soon. Other than that though, I have been diagnosed with Dysautonomia/POTS, Chronic Migraine with Aura, Optic Neuropathy, Chronic Fatigue, Hypersomnia, Empty Sella Syndrome, Chiari Malformation 1, Mitral Valve insufficiency, PVCs, Tremor, Ataxia, Dysphagia, Chronic Gastritis, Enterogastric Reflux, Pancytopenia, refractory vitamin deficiencies, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. A couple things highly suspected but not tested for yet: Gastroparesis or another generalized GI motility condition, Small Fiber Neuropathy, some kind of blood disorder, some form of epilepsy/seizure disorder, and possibly a connective tissue disease. I deal with a ton of symptoms and chronic pain that has basically left me housebound...and on the really bad days, bed bound. Everything has been somewhat progressive since I was little but in the last 1-2yrs, it has gained some real traction. I use mobility aides and need help with pretty much all tasks at this point. I'm trying so hard not to drown in the depressing nature of it all. I try to keep my humor, focus on things that bring me joy, and remind myself I'm on a big floating rock.

So anywho, if ya got this far, thanks for taking the time to listen to me yap, over share, and beg for friends! 🤣 Even if you don't want to go as far as being my bestie, maybe we can just chat it up in the comments! No pressure! 🆘",3,1740206456.0,ChronicIllness,1,1.0,False
1ivclq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ivclq1/could_i_get_into_legal_trouble_for_using_fonts/,Could I get into legal trouble for using fonts sourced from my Windows files in a web application?,"I used to play a game called Typewar a lot, and recently I noticed that it's been taken down, and in light of this, I have decided to create my own version of the game. The premise of the game is very simple; there is a single letter displayed and two font options. One of the options corresponds with the font being displayed, and the other does not. The user has to select the correct font. Here's a picture for reference: [https://multimedialearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/typewar-font-game.png](https://multimedialearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/typewar-font-game.png)

In the original game, I believe that the letters were displayed as images (you could tell because one of the letters for a certain font always had a little bit cut off at the bottom), but I would like to use real time dynamic rendering, where a letter is chosen at random, a font is chosen at random, and then the font is applied. I had a list of fonts that I wanted to include, some of them from the original game and some of them new, and about half are included with Windows. If I am not profiting off of this application, aside maybe from a ""buy me a coffee"" link or something like that, could I get in trouble for using the fonts in this way? I would be careful not to expose any files or inadvertently distribute the files. It would be similar to sites like google fonts, where you type in a sentence and it's displayed in the font you're demoing. 

Also, I doubt anyone would care at the company, and I'm making this primarily for myself and not for others, but could I get in trouble for copying Typewar? The company that created it seems to be dead, and I reached out to them on LinkedIn asking about the app and received no response. I also, again, would not be profiting off of this, and I will be making some changes to styling and adding game modes, although the core functionality will be the same.

A person living in an ancient civilization shunned by the Gods, caught in a middle of a War with the Cambrians, the God’s favored race. (The Aincent Civilization is living in under the world that the Cambrians live in, while the Cambrians live on the resource rich surface. The Cambrians resemble Humans, while the Ancients resemble Mantis-like humanoids.) The Cambrians are arrogant, and care nothing for their vast resources and are very wasteful, while the Ancients are very conservative with their limited resources. This led them to live in peace for like 20 years, before growing resentful as the Cambrians got jealous of the Ancient’s many metals, while the Ancients were bitter with how wasteful the Cambrians were with their food that the Ancients  could have so badly used. This led to the Great Land War. Now our main character, an Ancient Male who’s handy with daggers. (Book takes place like 40-50 years after dark ages, so coffee is popular, and new things are being discovered. Like gunpowder.) He is drafted into the military, and after going up through the early ranks, becomes a scout/spy behind enemy lines. (There is a Faction of Ancients that are Mercenaries being paid by the Cambrians.)  There he learns about Cambrian life and History, makes allies, kills people, and the book ends on a cliffhanger where he’s been captured as a spy.",1,1740206142.0,fantasywriting,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1ivchvr,https://i.redd.it/a8y2hen6xmke1.png,Princess Beneath the Starry Skies (ch2 pt2),"... 

 

 

 

Mika came to Schale’s Garden. Simple landscaping, simple pools, and potted flowers seen everywhere, all were very different from Trinity’s gorgeous decorations. 

Sitting down on the bench in the garden, Mika slowly took deep breaths, closing her eyes and trying hard to keep herself from shedding tears. 

https://preview.redd.it/69nbzd95vmke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=f133a078effd3e84ba0f229bf78374e8bee7aa54

But once she closed her eyes, she’ll recall Sensei’s awkward expression just then, the gaze that looked at her but then immediately shifted, in addition to the trouble that she had caused for Sensei in the past, and the fact she’s a troublemaker girl. 

Perhaps it’s that she had acknowledged the reality, that Sensei didn’t have any special thoughts about her, and calling her princess at that time was just words that he spoke just to act cool... 

“But I won’t even abandon my bad students.” “How dare you treat my precious princess like that!” Mika muttered to herself the words that had once come out of Sensei’s mouth. 

 

Ahh... after all, I’ve caused a lot of trouble or Sensei... 

The first time, I had made coffee for Sensei, but I kicked the table leg, the hot coffee not only burned Sensei’s whole body, but the broken coffee cup also scratched Sensei’s hands. 

https://preview.redd.it/hvxzvhq4vmke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=99322259bbbeb681c4d763a552b265824ea1f413

The second time, Sensei asked me to dispose of unnecessary documents, but I accidentally took one more copy and destroyed the important report as well. 

https://preview.redd.it/4ugugnv3vmke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c4b05cbb7998e4cd68089567d7d8b6fc91440eb

The third time, rarely saw Sensei command the battle. Although the boulder flying to Sensei was successfully broken, the boulder split into many small pieces, resulting in one of the stones hitting Sensei’s abdomen. Although it wasn’t a fatal injury, the battle was still forcefully ended. 

https://preview.redd.it/9rdvbt43vmke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=b47d79d888ded552ffde7e09b125603b0ab37cce

 

And this time... 

“Looks like Sensei has reached his tolerance limit for me.” Recalling Sensei’s reactions just then, and reviewing the past experiences, Mika probably figured it out, that her expressions became less uncomfortable. 

https://preview.redd.it/zkna9se2vmke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc410a5406b41e9a3efdc1336c7ae4e2a0b07ea8

 

 

 

After adjusting her mentality, Mika stood up and prepared to return to the office. But just as she returned to the office, she saw Sensei putting on the coat and was about to go out. 

“Is Sensei going out? Then let me be Sensei’s bodyguard!” Mika trotted to Sensei’s side, not noticing Sensei’s urgency at all. 

“Sorry, Mika, you might have to stay here this time.” Sensei looked at Mika, saying expressionlessly. 

... 

“Hey?” Mika was stunned for a moment, looking at Sensei in astonishment. 

https://preview.redd.it/d3r005j1vmke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0cf42f8e55cbd5b3fa788aa7a411cdfd443b70a

“There’s an emergency in the General Student Council, so I have to get there now.” Sensei quickly dressed, with no sloppiness in his movements, and completely no intention of staying. 

“How... how about me? What should I do...?” Mika looked at Sensei in a panic, even subconsciously taking a step forward, wanting to stop Sensei from leaving. 

https://preview.redd.it/dxosnio0vmke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=33bd0286cbd1587797030acf67d1b59752be1ab8

“Don’t, don’t go...” 

“Just go back first... after all, I don’t know how long it’ll last this time.” 

Hearing today’s duty being canceled, Mika’s heart was shocked, looking at Sensei in astonishment, an idea that should’ve never surfaced appeared in her mind. 

https://preview.redd.it/eijllqvzumke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=efa89cad4f1d2e3472967fa173a4c08401088170

“As long as I can let Sensei unable to leave Schale, then I’ll...” 

As soon as this thought came to her mind, Mika immediately shook her head vigorously, looking at Sensei very anxiously. She didn’t know what she could do to prevent Sensei from leaving, but she also knew that she couldn’t do so. The contradicting mood made Mika open her mouth, wanting to say something but not knowing what to say. 

https://preview.redd.it/3c9iz0ryumke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=17a28bb0e642e18399f5b9da8144235846be9b7b

“Mika, I really have to leave now...” Sensei, blocked by Mika, looked slightly anxious, his tone also became even colder. 

“No! I don’t want it! Sensei! I... I’ll behave good! Won’t be a troublemaker girl again! Please... don’t leave me alone here...” Unable to control her emotions anymore, Mika grabbed tight on Sensei’s clothes, burying her head into Sensei’s chest. 

Although knowing that she was causing trouble to Sensei by behaving like this, Mika couldn’t control herself, hoping and relying on this clumsy performance to keep Sensei here. 

Maybe he didn’t expect Mika to cry out, Sensei looked stunned. He gently pulled Mika away, bending down slightly, looking at Mika at eye level. 

https://preview.redd.it/3id89luxumke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=b05ce7b5ddce9e3eb92a3b0703bfdbb36a6853a3

“Mika, I know that you want to be a good child. Here, I have to go to General Student Council now, what should the good girl Mika do...?” 

Mika of course knew such a simple question’s answer, slowly loosened Sensei’s clothes, and stepped aside. 

“Sorry...” 

Sensei looked at Mika whose head was down, and looked up at the clock on the wall — it’s half past eleven now. 

“Mika, let’s have the meal together later this evening.” Sensei looked at Mika who was reduced to tears, gently caressing her head. Although he wanted to comfort her, the current situation really couldn’t let him waste even a minute or a second. 

“Really...?” Mika slowly raised her head, and her purple-gold pupils looked at Sensei with tears. 

https://preview.redd.it/8qhxcvtwumke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=03dbb7ef82237e3f25eda5a979cbcfa97e578c3a

“Yep. Also, I have something to say to you by then, I hope you can wait for me.” Sensei looked at Mika seriously, none any lies within his words. 

Mika reached out, gently holding Sensei’s hand to caress her cheek, feeling Sensei’s thick palms, Sensei’s warmth, and the tenderness that might be from Sensei’s last, through her cheek. 

“I don’t know how long I would be there, it’s okay if you go back to the dorm first, I’ll get to you again when I've handled them.” Sensei wiped away the tea from Mika’s eyes with his thumb, saying softly. 

“No, it’s okay, I can wait for Sensei at Schale.” Mika let go of Sensei’s hand, shallowly smiling. 

https://preview.redd.it/oos55b4wumke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b9e45f7c5c2bffac722f398ac4ba18d69b7a961

 

 

 

Subsequently, Mika followed Sensei along to the door, just like a newlywed wife, looking at Sensei leave, but Sensei seems to be still worried about Mika, looking back at her frequently. 

“I’m fine, Sensei, just go! I’ll behave well and wait for Sensei to come back!” Mika waved at Sensei. 

“If it went too late then just go back to the dorm first! I’ll get to you again!” Sensei shouted at Mika, then began taking steps and ran in the direction of the General Student Council. 

Looking at Sensei leave, until Sensei disappeared from her sight, Mika slowly put away her smile, looking up at the blue sky. 

https://preview.redd.it/oxu49zouumke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4d639f307f5a9c1f0ec1c99ad831849b6154f8f

The comfortable breeze gently blew, and Mika closed her eyes, feeling loneliness, feeling anxiety, feeling fear, feeling helplessness. 

https://preview.redd.it/wnmgwdttumke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c61d00d3b6cf2df1b052bfd1148ea3325e8113

Inexhaustible helplessness and fantasy emerged in Mika’s mind, afraid that she wouldn’t ever get Sensei’s attention and tenderness after today, afraid that she would no longer be Sensei’s “bad student” after today, afraid that she would no longer be Sensei’s princess after today. 

“You are the greatest danger to Sensei.” Mika recalled Nagisa’s words to her again. 

https://preview.redd.it/dvbd39ysumke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=70c9b31bda7e58633f33bd67fa67e221a3a43b0e

Mika closed her eyes, feeling extremely remorseful and self-reproachful to her thoughts of wanting to hurt Sensei. Sensei didn’t only belong to herself but also to other students, yet she selfishly wanted to take Sensei for herself... 

https://preview.redd.it/dbq2hnrrumke1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=29fae70007305588f999dbf3f497f1cf308468c1

“Sorry... Sensei, I truly... couldn’t be a good girl.”

This time I started at 213 and Im at 175 (38 gone...35 more to go)

let me tell you what works for me.

1) night before : 3 egg cheese omelette cooked on low heat in real butter (no parkay or land o lakes). get the best butter you can

2) dont be shy with your butter and cheese. 

3) eat it for breakfast. i drink arizona diet green tea with my omelette

4) when you get hungry eat some of that tasty butter. somechicken soup is ok too. and burgers with pickles, mayo and mustard

5) diet coke, carbonated water, coffee witj splenda

rinse and repeat

sauna - i do 2 sessions for 20 mins. stretch in there if you can. i do 30 crunches and 20 pushups in there. start out light and build up to 2 sessions of 20 mins with a break inbetween

do the sauna sessions as many days as possible

get enough sleep

youll be peeing a lot so drink lots throughout the day

look for light yellow pee color it should stay this color

eat til youre full. this diet works by eating not by starving

avoid ""keto-friendly products"" 

anyway thats what works for me. no need to count macros calories etc but hey thats me

good luck

1ivcc4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1ivcc4m/i_think_im_finally_starting_to_understand_sleep/,I think I’m finally starting to understand “sleep when the baby sleeps”,"(Disclaimer: I’m speaking with all the wisdom and experience of a first-time dad of a 2-week-old.)

Before my son was born, I didn’t think very highly of the old advice “sleep when the baby sleeps”. It sounded like a platitude, like getting sleep would be simple if you just didn’t insist on sleeping only at night. “One weird trick to get sleep as a new parent!” I told my wife about the joke version I saw on Reddit, “sleep when the baby sleeps, eat when the baby eats, do laundry when the baby does laundry…” and we laughed and laughed.

But I think I was misunderstanding it. Instead of reading it like “here’s a helpful idea”, I’m now reading it more like a direct order, or a plea. More like, “please, for the love of god, sleep when the baby sleeps.” That is, I need to *prioritize* sleep in a way that I never did before.

I’m realizing that getting an extra hour of sleep is *important* even when it’s rarely *urgent*. If the baby has just gone down for a nap, and the dishes need to be done, and the laundry needs to be folded, and the mail needs to be sorted, and I’d still feel pretty functional if I have a cup of coffee… in that situation, it might seem like taking a nap is a lazy or selfish choice, but it is *not*. It’s *vital* that I get good rest, not least because there’s no telling when the baby will give me another chance at it.

So yeah, this is me officially giving myself permission and encouragement to take the nap *before* I’m in a state of utter collapse!

1ivcc2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFA/comments/1ivcc2j/free_from_prison/,Free from prison,"Top 10 signs:

1️⃣ Your room no longer looks like a library explosion – No more Schweser books, CFA curriculum, or random sticky notes with formulas you barely understood.

2️⃣ You’ve rediscovered this magical thing called “Sleep” – And you won’t shut up about how amazing it is.

3️⃣ No more CFA-induced nightmares – No more waking up in a cold sweat thinking about Derivatives, FRA, or Fixed Income. (Also, your calculator is no longer your emotional support object.)

4️⃣ You suddenly have an insane amount of free time – …and no clue what to do with it. What do normal people even do on weekends??

5️⃣ The words “most likely” and “least likely” no longer send you into fight-or-flight mode – You can finally read multiple-choice questions without breaking into a cold sweat.

6️⃣ You still wake up at 5 AM out of habit… but there’s no CFA mock waiting for you – Just existential dread and the realization that you have hobbies to rediscover.

7️⃣ Your friends (the ones who stuck around) are SHOCKED when you say yes to plans – “Wait… you’re coming? Like, actually?”

8️⃣ Coffee and Red Bull are no longer your primary food groups – You’re finally eating real meals again, and your body is confused but grateful.

9️⃣ You’re back on social media after months of radio silence – Time to spam everyone’s feed with “Just finished CFA, time to touch grass” posts.

🔟 You actually MISS studying – Stockholm Syndrome? CFA-induced brain damage? Who knows, but you kinda want to go back… and that’s terrifying.

1ivca5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ivca5l/graveyard_shift/,Graveyard Shift,"I wasn’t a private detective, yet here I was, taking on a private job for someone—a coward, a friend. The news came from the chief, who told me that a young woman named Lisa had personally requested my help, claiming she trusted me more than anyone. That, and the fact that I was a cop.

At first, I was skeptical about who Lisa was, but then I remembered—our class representative from high school. And now, she had a job for me. More specifically, a job where I was supposed to help. She told me to meet her outside the café Moonlight next Sunday. For four days, I tried to contact her, but the only thing she ever said was: ""Information will be given once we meet in person."" And ""Nothing illegal.""

Convenient timing—the day I was supposed to meet Lisa happened to be the memorial day for my late grandfather. Moonlight was located just outside the cemetery. So after paying my respects to my granddad, I crossed the street and entered the café.

I arrived at 6 p.m. Since it was evening, the place wasn’t too crowded.

Lisa showed up at 7. She wore a hoodie despite it being summer, which made me assume this job would take place outside at night. The fact that she chose a café as our meeting spot also suggested she needed caffeine—probably for a job that ran into the late hours. I figured I could spare time until midnight since my shift started at 9 a.m.

We sat down, drank coffee, and talked about life until 8. That’s when Lisa stood up and said she was ready to show me what the job was. I had no idea what to expect. Maybe something strength-related?

But where she led me was the graveyard. In the middle of the night.

At that point, I was convinced this was some kind of practical joke.

She stopped in front of one particular gravestone—one I immediately knew was significant. It was massive, easily twice the size of the others in both height and width, adorned with intricate details. If I had to describe it briefly, I’d say it looked like a small fortress.

As agreed, I was allowed to leave at midnight, but Lisa was staying until 5 a.m. Our job was simple: to watch over the large tomb.

The layout of the grave was unusual. It had three pedestals, with a small crucifix perched on top of the tallest one—easily double my height. A fence surrounded the entire gravesite, making it stand out even more.

The grave belonged to someone named Alice. No surname, no date of death, no epitaph. Just:

""Grave of Alice.""

I guessed she had been some kind of noblewoman who spent her final days building her own resting place. The lack of additional information made me wonder if this was actually a family mausoleum.

""All we have to do is watch this part of the grave,"" Lisa said, pointing to the back of the stone.

But she wasn’t pointing at just any part of the grave.

There was something I didn’t expect to see.

A door.

Not just a carving of one—an actual door, complete with a doorknob.

Interesting. Maybe it was meant for family members to access the tomb? If that were the case, then this really might be a mausoleum. Of course, our job was just to watch, not to open it. Not that we could—the door was locked.

As time passed, any lingering sense of unease I had (not that I had much to begin with) was slowly replaced by sheer boredom.

""Who hired you for this job?"" I asked, breaking the silence.

""City council,"" she replied.

""So you’re some kind of council agent?""

""Actually, I’m a university student. Saw the flyer on a billboard. The council offered $40 an hour, and I took the job.""

""And how are you handling your sleep schedule?""

Lisa took a sip of coffee before answering.

""My lectures start at 1 p.m., so I can sleep until then. Don’t worry about me, Alex—I’m a practical person.""

She was. That’s what people called her back in high school—Practical Lisa. A grandmaster of time management. Always arriving on time, leaving on time. Homework and assignments finished early, never rushed, always top grades.

The clock read 9:20 p.m. Two hours and forty minutes to go. We had already spent an hour and twenty minutes in the cemetery, yet it felt like mere minutes.

I leaned back and stared at the tombstone, wondering who was buried there.

Then—

Plop.

A sound.

Something black fell from the sky, hit the stone, and dropped to the ground.

I jerked up. Lisa flinched at the noise. Then—again. Another black object struck the grave.

We both looked down at the entrance of the tomb.

Two blackbirds lay there. Bloody. Motionless.

Dead.

I barely had time to process it before another thud sounded. A third bird dropped.

Three dead birds.

I froze. My mind scrambled for an explanation. Lisa, silent beside me, was likely thinking the same thing.

I crouched down and picked up the corpses. I wasn’t sure why—maybe out of respect for the burial ground. As I passed the door of the grave, a wave of nausea hit me.

The smell.

Lisa noticed my reaction and stepped forward—only to gag as well.

The door. That particular part of the grave reeked.

Of rot. Of filth. Of something foul.

Lisa dropped to her knees, retching. Instinct kicked in—I grabbed her arm and dragged her away from the doorway. Strangely, the second we stepped back into open air, the smell vanished.

""You okay?"" I asked.

""Just... get rid of the birds,"" she muttered.

I did as she asked, dumping the bodies in a trash bin before returning to my seat.

I checked the time again. Two more hours to go.

I leaned against a tree, exhaustion creeping up on me. A strange omen, falling asleep in the middle of a graveyard. Not exactly a good sign.

But my mind kept drifting back to the blackbirds. Not the Beatles song—the real ones. The ones that fell from the sky and died.

What was that all about?

At some point, I must have dozed off, though not completely. I could still hear the wind, the ambient night sounds, and Lisa muttering to herself:

""What the fuck am I doing?""

I opened my eyes and glanced at her. She was looking something up on her phone—probably searching for information on Alice, just as I was about to suggest.

We found nothing.

Every search result led to people from different places that shared our town’s name. The only Alice I came across was Alice Hill, a policewoman from another precinct—definitely not our Alice. In fact, she had just liked a post about a Domino’s weekend deal.

Yeah. Not the Alice we were looking for.

Another hour passed. Only 30 minutes left before I could head home.

Then—thunder rumbled in the distance.

As I packed my bag, I noticed something odd. A part of it was tangled in the branches on the ground. That was the logical explanation.

But from my perspective, it felt like the ground itself had swallowed my bag’s strap.

Like it was pulling me in.

I yanked hard, and when it finally came loose, I stumbled back—

Right as lightning struck the tree I had been resting against.

The next thing I knew, I was on the ground, screaming.

Embers burned into my back. Pain. Confusion.

Lisa’s voice cut through the haze.

""ARE YOU OKAY?!""

I nodded. I wasn’t okay.

I needed to leave.

Lisa refused. She was getting paid, after all.

We argued.

In the end, I left her behind.

The burn marks from embers in the thunderstorm had washed away by the time I arrived home. One stroke of luck was that I had managed to leave the tree in time. The burns still stung, and with exhaustion and injury weighing on me, I barely made it to my bed before darkness consumed me.

In my dreams, I found myself back at the cemetery—alone this time, in the morning. I wandered through the graves until I reached the one I had guarded the night before—the one with the door.

As I approached from the side where the door was, it slowly creaked open. Emerging from within were two figures—Lisa and me—but not as we were. They were rotting, crawling with maggots, resurrected corpses from years past.

I jolted awake, gasping for air. What a nightmare.

At least I had slept enough to heal physically. Mentally? I wasn’t so sure.

I dressed, got into my car, and drove to the station. On the way, I checked in with Lisa. She told me she had gone home and then added:

Are you okay?I am not.

That unsettled me. I immediately called her. The moment she answered, I expected her to say something—anything—but there was only silence. No words, no breathing. Just the distant ambiance of her home.

I messaged her again. No response. I decided to wait until our next visit to the cemetery.

At the station, I tried to dig up any information related to the grave Lisa had been assigned to watch. Nothing. So, I focused on my usual work—writing reports. By noon, I was out patrolling the streets.

The city was soon drenched in heavy rain, reducing visibility to almost nothing. I had to navigate using only the silhouettes of buildings. Eventually, I sought shelter in a small building, waiting for the downpour to subside. I informed my team that the storm was delaying my return to the station. The rain was so dense that I could barely see a few yards ahead.

I decided to push forward despite the conditions. As I moved through the misty streets, a silhouette of a woman appeared in the distance. At first, I thought she was just another pedestrian. But as I got closer, her face remained obscured. No matter how near I got, she remained a dark figure against the fog.

Dumbfounded, I questioned whether I was hallucinating or if the mist was so thick that even nearby people became invisible. As I pondered, the fog began to lift, and I turned my gaze back to where she had walked.

I froze. I was no longer on the street.

I was back at the cemetery.

At the same tomb.

Alice’s tomb.

The lightning-struck tree stood there.

I was there.

I stumbled back, staring at the grave. It looked the same—unchanged, undisturbed—yet…

How had I ended up here?

But I had no time to dwell on that. I had a duty to return to my patrol. Checking my watch, I felt a cold wave of unease wash over me. 12:50 PM.

I had been waiting out the rain for what felt like 20 minutes. But nearly an hour had passed.

I ran back to the station, my mind racing with questions. How did I end up at the graveyard?

When my shift ended at five, Lisa asked me to meet her at the same café across from the cemetery. As I sipped my coffee, I watched mourners entering and leaving the graveyard.

Then, I noticed a homeless-looking person enter.

And that was the last thing I remembered before Lisa tapped my shoulder.

I asked her about the message she had sent earlier—the one where she said she wasn’t okay. But she denied ever sending it. In fact, she claimed she never even received my message.

I showed her my phone. She showed me hers. The last message between us was from yesterday. She swore she hadn’t deleted anything.

I checked the number. It was the right one.

Either there had been a system glitch, or something else was going on. The latter seemed… unlikely.

Or was it?

Night fell, and we entered the cemetery once again, making our way to Alice’s grave. Lisa pulled out her phone, searching for any information about Alice.

I stared at the grave, then at the door embedded within it. The doorknob was still there. The tomb stood tall and imposing. As I gazed at it, I felt myself growing drowsy.

I fought to keep my eyes open, and when I refocused, I saw something.

A person approaching from the far end of the cemetery.

The woman in white.

I stood and told Lisa to stay put as I followed her. She had been lingering here for too long.

As soon as she noticed me, she turned and walked away—then quickened her pace.

She was running.

Instincts kicked in. Either she was planning to spend the night among the graves, or she was hiding something. Either way, she needed to be stopped.

But the moment I pursued her, I realized something.

She was fast.

Inhumanly fast.

I lost her.

No—it was worse than that. The cemetery was small, yet she had completely disappeared, as if she had never been there at all.

Frustrated, I turned back.

Lisa was gone.

Not in the watching area. No notes. No trace.

I called her name, scanning the darkness—until I saw it.

The door in the grave was open.

A pit formed in my stomach. If she had gone inside, I had to follow.

A rotten stench flooded out as I stepped forward. Something dead was down there.

I descended into the darkness. What I found made me freeze.

A vast chamber filled with skeletons. Mutilated corpses. Bottles of strange, unidentifiable liquids. And in the center—an altar.

Lisa lay upon it.

Her throat had been slit.

I rushed to her in panic, only for something wet to drip onto my face.

I looked up.

A crimson drop fell onto Lisa’s body. Then another. And another.

It was raining blood.

Inside. With no open ceiling.

Lisa’s body was drenched in it. So was I.

I screamed.

I fled. I didn’t stop running until I reached my home, collapsing onto the floor. Everything faded to black.

I awoke to a phone call. My colleague informed me that the grave had been raided—and a body was found inside.

Lisa’s body.

I was immediately under suspicion. My role as a policeman was suspended until further investigation.

Weeks passed. The case remained unsolved. Lisa’s death was not a suicide.

At her funeral, she was buried in the same cemetery where she had died.

Afterward, I stopped by the café. As I left, I noticed a plaque on the wall.

It read:

In 1600, this site was the cottage of a witch named Alice. Born in 1570, she lived until 1699 when the townspeople burned her at the stake—at the very location of the city cemetery.

In 1933, a man named Charles Grover was found dead in the same spot where she perished.

As I read, realization struck me.

That it might have not been the city council that lured Lisa to the grave.",5,1740204914.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
