Want to meet someone naturally but is online dating my only  choice?,"hello everyone,  I moved back home and im now finishing my uni studies online. in some months time my studies will be over.

Im worrying about turning 30 and being single.  sorry this is long. im so lost. I walk around and see couples and I imagine lots of guys not all but lots of guys are taken at around my age. I might never meet the one. 

I have a best friend and an another good friend but they are studying post grad many hours away. I have no one to hang with back home here and the guys around here that ive seen and no disrespect they just drink nd are not interested in other things , leaning about things etc!

I feel lost. I hate myself because I have about 60- 80 pounds to lose. Despite this when I was at uni I sometiemes still got hit on, apparently I have a cute pretty face.

I feel lonely. I don't hang with anyone here now ive moved back.

I keep reading on Reddit that 30 is the wall and it gets even harder bc guys have more of a choice for younger women, this makes me feel worried. The bonus Is I look younger than what I am. Some people at uni even thought I was  there age.

I worry im in a dash to find a good man. I wish it would happen naturally and my fam keep saying it will happen when I least expect it. Thing is I live in a town and feel limited but if I move I might feel even more lonely. Do I travel on day trips out and still live at home and go to museums and coffee shops on my own ? I just feel like that won't happen though. Also I had a really scary experience on a dating app years ago and I like the thought of meeting someone naturally and not looking for love ?? it seems abit forced but it seems to be the way people are meeting now? so many choices and filters its a minefield.

Do I focus on losing weight first.?  do I stay and try to sort things out here? I live rent free and my fam mem is very kind but they have anxiety and talk about their health a lot and that also gets me down..",1,1730688504.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

When I need to go into the office I end up stressing myself out. Even waking up early and drinking a strong coffee I can never have a BM before work. If I do, it’s because I really strained and it’ll be incomplete so I avoid doing that. So usually my days in the office I feel really bloated and uncomfortable. It’s bad because I want to show up more often, but I feel like this really ruins my day.

","I have a couple of bags of coffees I have been trying to brew using both Vertuo rubber lids and reusable Original metal pods from a certain company, and it has mostly been mixed results. I learned about Sealpod who claim that their one-use foil lids might hopefully produce a stronger cup of espresso compared to reusable lids.

I was initially going to purchase their $40 starter 2-pod set, but held off after noticing two things:

* Shipping fee is a stiff $30 for any order under $60, making the starter pack effectively the same price as the $70 5-pack (I'm in the US).
* They only accept PayPal, with no option at all to pay with cards.

Has anyone else had this unusual experience trying to buy SealPod products? I kind of want to double check that I am not on some sort of phishing site, because I have never seen an online shop where PayPal is the only accepted form of payment. I have basically no PayPal experience FYI.

Moreover, are there any other ways to brew a stronger espresso with custom beans using Original or Vertuo Nespresso machines considering that my current reusable pod systems aren't really working well, or should I just drop $300 on an actual espresso maker instead?",1,1730688121.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

2. **Major Crops**: Brazil is a leading producer of several key crops, including soybeans, sugarcane, coffee, corn, and beef. It is the largest exporter of soybeans and sugar in the world.
3. **Diverse Climate**: The country's diverse climate allows for a wide range of agricultural activities, from tropical crops in the north to temperate crops in the south.
4. **Economic Impact**: Agriculture plays a significant role in Brazil's economy, contributing about 5% to the country's GDP and employing a substantial portion of the workforce.
5. **Export Strength**: Brazil is one of the largest agricultural exporters, particularly to countries like China and the European Union, making it a vital player in global food supply chains.

1gj48zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menieres/comments/1gj48zx/is_this_menires/,Is this Menires?,"June of last year I had a horrible vertigo attack. I was asleep on my left side, got up as usual and bam! room was spinning. I was so dizzy that I ended up hugging the Oval Office for a good while. I had no idea what was going on. Had my husband call 911 and was taken to the hospital. I just remember this evil, violent spin that almost hurt. The next day this PT guy came to my room and suspected BPPV in my left ear. He did a series of Epley. It didn't really help. I went home and was in my room for 5 days. 

Got another episode in July, twice in same day, but they weren't as violent. The first occurred in bed when I stretched out. The second when I rolled over. I vomited and then it seemed to be ok. 

The last episode happened end of July, again when I woke up. This time it was different. I was sick for 6 hours, vomitting nothing at one point...heaving to the point my ribs hurt. I took Meclazine and Zofran...got the chills and fell asleep. Felt better when I woke. 

All episodes had Nystagmus. I felt like I was on a people mover for months and months...like the risidual from my episodes just lingered. 

Since then I saw a PT for 6 months which helped, but she never was able to see anything, but didn't think it was BPPV. 

Saw and ENT beginning of year which was pointless...though it said same thing...thought it was neurological. Hearing test was great. No issues. 

Saw another ENT recently. Hearing test was great, no issues. Though he suspects Menieres. I am to get an MRI next week. 

A few things I've learned since. Viatmin D was low, before my 1st attack I got vertigo for a few seconds, would look down and it'd go away. Noticed up to the attack I'd get these weird outer body brain zaps things where it jolts me. Scary, but lasted a few seconds. They happen in sleep, too. Head beats to my heart beat, but no pain. Sinuses hurt often, but no infection. Sometimes if I get upset, I can feel a little off. 

I do not have loss of hearing that I can tell or my tests have suggested....though I can hear my heart beat, woosh, woosh sound and my right ear when all is quiet and rings often (3 to 4 times a day) but just for a few seconds. Right hear also is muffled or rattled when my kids scream. Like somethings in it rattling. Sometimes loud noise bothers me. Laying flat for long periods of time freaks me out and feel it contributes to my off feeling. 

I don't drink  coffee, but have an occasional acaii, don't eat that high of sodium foods. Blood work came back a few weeks ago and everything was fine. I don't feel any ear fullness...at least that I can tell. 

I am on Ozempic to lower my A1C as when I was in hospital it was on higher side. It's lowered now. 
Other than that, I take a nose spray every now and again. I am perimenopause. Healthy otherwise, just hormonal changes as I turn the page to life's other chapter.

Yesterday, I was at Target and got another one of those brain zaps and it scared me. It was really off putting. I felt those in and oit sensations like 6 times yesterday and woke me a few times in my sleep. I'm deathly afraid of the attacks happening again. I try to move on, but my not so good moments bring me back every time.

I wasn't able to do a M&G until yesterday because I was out of town the month before. The house was pretty messy during the M&G, which the owner acknowledged. She mentioned she's ""sort of a hoarder"" and I *thought* she said she would be having a housecleaner come before I was scheduled to start. I got there today and the house was still a complete mess and the owner said the cleaner wouldn't be coming until Weds (so that would have required me to stay 3 nights with the house in its current condition). There was literally crap piled high on every surface, no room in the fridge for me to put my things, underwear on the living room floor, dirty dishes in the sink and on the coffee table, two bottles of *sleeping pills* on the coffee table that the dogs could have easily gotten into if they tried, it didn't seem as if the bed had clean sheets, the towels didn't look clean, and the balcony was covered in dog poop (something she said would be cleaned up before I started). There was also a huge bong and weed paraphernalia lying around and the real kicker is, she was growing magic mushrooms in the spare bathroom. My husband took one look and said ""this is totally unacceptable"" and that I would not be staying there.

As I was reporting all of this to Rover's Trust & Safety team, I got a text from the owner asking me to leave the apartment immediately because she could hear my phone conversation on the nanny cam, which she definitely did not make me aware of. Luckily Rover handled the situation well and assured me they would do everything they can to find a new sitter (ideally someone who can board the dogs at their home so they don't have to stay at the owner's home) and given the severity of the situation, the owner might actually get removed from the platform. The crazy thing is, the owner is also a Rover sitter so you'd think she would know better. The whole situation has left me feeling awful and wary of dogsitting in someone else's home again, at least not without properly vetting it well in advance.

One other thing that happened - I noticed yesterday that she had only booked for one dog. When I went to modify the booking for two dogs (one of which is a puppy, so more $), the price doubled. I felt bad mentioning this the day before I was scheduled to start and we agreed to meet in the middle in terms of price, but it's something I wish I would have caught sooner. Maybe it was an oversight on her part, but after the situation today it's possible it wasn't an accident.",1,1730687713.0,RoverPetSitting,4,0.67,False

Background: Krista and I are both 30F. We went to high school together and were very good friends during that time. We never hung out on weekends, but we both have strict parents so that was the norm for us. We were super close during the week though. We went to separate colleges, I stayed in our hometown (Las Cruces, NM) and she went to a school out of state. We still saw each other during breaks and hung out, but didn't keep in contact a ton during the regular school year as we were both busy with college lives. We would still text, facetime, snapchat, etc though. When we would hang out on breaks, I'd usually drive to her family's place (1 hour away) as she never learned to drive. She would thank me but that's all, she would never offer to pay for gas or treat me for anything as a thank you. It was still super fun to hang out, and we always had good time. I graduated college a year early and went to grad school right after (at the same school I went to undergrad). She graduated and then went to medical school at a Caribbean school (super far away) so we lost touch a bit as she didn't come home as much and was busy with the demands of medical school. She then moved to New York City after matching to residency to become a physician, and I was thrilled for her.

Now: I currently work as a nurse. I still live in Las Cruces, I love my job but it doesn't pay a ton, so I currently work a second job teaching to make ends meet. I have always had a rough time with friendships and was a chronic people pleaser in my 20s, but am working to improve that. I have lost a lot of friends over the past few years as they were almost all one-sided and with people who weren't the greatest. I still have stayed friends with Krista though, as we had a lot of good memories together and usually have a great time together.

A few months ago, I visited Krista in NYC after she invited me to visit during her spring break. The flight was long and expensive, but I figured it would be worth it, as I was super excited to see her (we haven't seen each other in over a year at that point) and I was very excited to visit NYC for the first time. She told me to stay with her in her apartment; it is a studio, but plenty of room for the both of us. The day I got in, she texted me that she had to pick up a night shift and to let myself in. I was bummed but understood, and figured I could at least look more presentable when I saw her given my long traveling day and have the place to myself. She said we could start doing things in the afternoon the next day, but she was going to sleep for most of the morning, so I should go explore.

I went out the next day to check out the area while she was still sleeping. I brought her back some coffee and breakfast and we started chatting like old times. We went out and did a bunch of touristy things, she was a great tour guide and we had an excellent time. I thanked her for letting me stay with her and for showing me around.

The next day, she said we were going to meet up with a girl we both went to high school with who also lives in NYC, named Jessica. I wasn't super close to her, but they were close. Krista knows I don't have a ton of money. Both Jessica and Krista have very well off families who pay for almost all of their expenses (ie they pay for their rent, vacations, clothes, etc). I think that is great for them, but that is not my situation (zero jealousy, truly). She chose a very expensive restaurant for dinner that night, but I didn't say anything as I was just excited for dinner. We get to dinner, and Jessica just says hi to me and then immediately only talks to Krista about her life and things that they have done together. I tried asking Jessica questions and she gave me short answers, then went right back to talking to Krista. When it came time for ordering, they ordered multiple drinks and appetizers. I have a few food allergies (that Krista knows about) so I couldn't eat much of the menu, but I was able to get a salad and glass of wine. They ordered their entrees and then dessert. The waiter even noticed I wasn't able to eat much and brought me some fruit (which was incredibly nice of him). When it came time for the bill, it was close to $400. I went to ask for a separate check, and Krista said we could just split it 3 ways. I was upset as I didn't want to pay for their food, but just paid for it quietly as I didn't want to make a big deal when I already felt awkward.

Jessica invited us back to her apartment after dinner. While they were talking, they were making fun of people who never left their hometowns and that people who don't live in NYC just ""don't get it"", and that people who don't travel out of the country are missing out (I haven't been able to do that yet, which I don't think they knew; I obviously want to travel once I can afford it). They weren't talking about me, but I obviously felt bothered by it. I again didn't say anything as I felt awkward and just laughed along with them.

The night took a further turn when Jessica brought out a bunch of edibles and wanted us to take them with her. I'm not bothered by it, but it's not something I do and my job does random drug tests, so I just told her ""no thank you"". They both kept pushing me to take them with them but I kept saying no, and eventually just went to another room and played with her cats and came back out when they had a movie on and they were chill. It was around 3am when Krista wanted to go home, and she wanted to take the train back. I said I didn't feel comfortable, as Jessica's area wasn't great and Krista was high, plus I didn't really know how to get around quite yet. I said we should Uber, Krista finally agreed. The uber ended up costing $65, and Krista said we should've just taken the train, and didn't offer to pay. We went home and then went to sleep.

The next day, Krista slept in until most of the afternoon, and I went to breakfast and to a few shops on my own. When I got back, she was up and told me she wanted to go get her nails done, and that I could go explore some more. I just said ok, and ended up going to a workout class. She gave me the key to her place as I would be back before her. We did our separate activities, then went to dinner and a broadway show later that night. Everything went well and was normal.

Later that night, my mom called me at 2am saying my dog (who she was watching) accidentally got hurt and had to go to the emergency vet to get stitches (he ended up being totally fine, thankfully). Since we were sleeping, I went into the hallway outside her place to take the call. She was up and asked what was wrong so I told her, and she just said ""oh that sucks"" and went back to sleep.

The next morning ,we were going to head out to go see Central Park and Krista couldn't find her apartment key. She immediately became angry and told me I lost it, since I went in the hallway last night and went to the workout class with it. I said I brought it back both times, as I was able to let myself in, and that she had it all night as we obviously were able to get in/out of her place. She tore the place apart, and asked me to go back to the workout place to see if I left it there. I was certain I didn't, but went anyways to appease her. I even walked through the hallways and elevators of her place. No key. We went to Central Park and she talked about the key the entire time, and that she was going to have to call a locksmith to get a new key, and she didn't want to have to pay for it. She told me to finish walking around Central Park, and she was going back home to look for the key again (the doorman was letting her in/out at this point). I said ok (frankly I wanted to be alone at this point, as I was worried about my dog, overtired, and kinda upset at how this whole trip was going), so she left me there and went home. I finished walking around, she texted me to pick up lunch and bring it back. I said I would as I was also hungry. On my way back home, she texted me that she found the key. It was in her pants pocket from the other night. She didn't apologize once. I asked her to venmo me to pay for her half of lunch and she said that I could cover it as my ""hotel fee"", presumably for staying with her. I was irritated at this point and calmly told her that I paid for the Uber the other night and for part of a dinner that I wasn't able to eat most of. She rolled her eyes but venmo'd me her half. When I weas cleaning up lunch, I went to take her trash out (I had a spinach salad and didn't want it to stink the place up, and she told me to not do that as ""trash bags cost money"". The rest of the night was awkward.

I was worried about my dog and not having a great time, so I decided to move my flight up a day. I told her I needed to go home early because of my dog and she just said ""ok"". I make sure to clean up everything, wash her sheets, etc. She didn't say anything. When it was time for me to go, she was sitting on her computer, shopping on amazon. When my uber arrived, she just said ""bye"", without looking up from her computer. I walked down on my own and headed to the car. She did text me to see if I got to the airport ok, I said yes and thanked her again for letting me stay with her and for being her tour guide. She then texted me a few days later to make sure I got home ok.

I really haven't heard from her, until she called me in tears one night because she got an evaluation at work that said she was arrogant, hard to work with, etc. I pumped her up and gave her a good pep talk; once it was over, she just said thank you and hung up the phone, without talking about anything else. A few weeks later, she texted me ""so I think I have a boyfriend"". I texted her back saying ""tell me everything!"" and she said ""I will tomorrow"". We have both been single for a while given the craziness that is dating nowadays, so I was truly happy for her. But weeks passed. She was super active on social media, posting a ton during that time, so I knew nothing bad was going on. I was a bit irritated so I texted her ""still waiting to hear about this guy"" and she gave me a brief one-liner about him and how they met. I responded that I was happy for her and that was it.

I know our friendship is basically over, but I feel horrible about the whole situation. I feel really upset about it all and I don't know why I can't shake this. I have zero intention of ever reaching out to her again. We haven't texted since the boyfriend news. I blocked her on snapchat but kept her on instagram. She constantly posts on instagram with her other friends and now boyfriend, and I now have very few friends and just feel like crap about it all. I know that sounds incredibly jealous and petty and I genuinely hate that I feel that way, and I don't get how people so easily have so many friends and a boyfriend when I have been struggling so much in those areas. I really never put these thoughts onto ""paper"" but I think that is the root of why I feel the way that I do with this. Is there any advice for how to handle this situation better? Am I just being jealous and petty? What do you think?",2,1730687464.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Then, I just start swallowing food and my body craves things like bread or something fatty. When i eat enough I feel relieved, almost like drugged and I get sleepy. I also feel like my mind is suddenly getting clearer.

My blood sugar is perfect, I even measured it while being in this state, also done 3 hour OGTT test and all the other tests.

I have gastritis, mild esophagitis and hiatal hernia. Im also looking into SIBO or something similar as a root cause. Generally, I have a great amount of gases and my stomach is bloated most of the time. Gases are especially in the upper part of the digestive system and I also don't burp. 
These shaky low blood sugar feeling has been happening before if I drink coffee, and I haven't eaten a ton of food before. I see it as adding s layer of fat protection to my stomach. If I fill my stomach with some heavy food e.g. from bakery I can even drink coffee.

This first happened 4 years ago after I lost some weight and changed my diet (reduced all the bad stuff significantly)and I have developed panic attacks and bunch of other staff, POTS symptoms that were bad but went away now came back. This all kinda resolved in the meantime, but I was eating a lot, my weight was 106 kg. After losing weight and skipping meals for 2 or 3 months it came back with a vengence. Both times these flares happened it was after losing weight and skipping meals for a while. I just feel like my stomach and my absorbtion is somehow screwed up.

1gj3rj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1gj3rj7/the_big_empty_part_1/,The Big Empty - Part 1,"**Chapter 1: Daphne**

Daphne Martinez floated in the small reactor room. Her gloved hands making it near impossible to perform a correct assessment of the now half disassembled reactor. The wall of text on its console wasn’t much better either. All that she knew was that after the ship started its deceleration burn, it suddenly dropped the reactor core, a ball of incredibly hot plasma that fused helium to produce energy.

The triton was an old ship, it had been doing the Ceres to Moon haul for the last 50 or so years and there was always an occasional glitch. A small leak here, a short circuit there. But this time, it was different. Dumping core would only be done under a very few circumstances. One, reactor overload, which would turn it into a bomb. Or second, someone had manually dumped it. this wasn’t the sort of thing she could overlook; it was Strange to say the least.

“Martinez! Anything interesting down there?” Captain Lee called; his voice exasperated.

“Nothing we didn’t already know, I don’t think this reactor will be “reacting” any time soon, not during this emergency anyway”. Daphne replied, she got angry at herself. She should stop making jokes at times like this, even if they helped keep her anxiety attacks at bay.

“Then get the emergency batteries working, we won’t be able to fix the reactor if we stop breathing in a couple hours, also I am already tired of wearing an EVA inside the ship”. The captain was right. Daphne had gotten so focused on fixing the reactor that she failed to see the immediate danger, if she didn’t fix the batteries, they’d all be dead in a couple of hours. She was way out of her depth here.

She made her way to the engineering room half floating and half walking, she wasn’t used to zero g just yet, “probably not a good thing for someone who works in space”, she thought. Ships like The Triton didn’t get competent engineers. Those were too expensive and would refuse to board ships like it out of pure self-preservation. Daphne was painfully aware of this now.

A wave of dizziness washed over her and a loud beeping noise made itself impossible to ignore. The blood oxygen alert. She’d forgotten to swap her air bottle. Daphne carefully took a replacement and connected it to her suit; it was her second to last one. She’d need to work faster. Each bottle would last only about an hour.

When she got to the emergency battery array, she started a physical inspection of every single battery she could get her hands on, all of them told the same story. Battery at 95% charge or more, working perfectly, and still, they hadn’t kicked in once the reactor failed.

“didn’t you get the memo? we’re in an emergency, Emergency battery” she muttered to herself, as she meticulously inspected another battery. That gave her an idea. She’d been looking for physical failure, a conector missing or a wire that had short circuited. But she hadn’t looked for a programming glitch. She wasn’t a programmer after all, but she knew someone who was.

“Jimmie, Jimmie, can you hear me?” Daphne asked.

“I’m here kid, please don’t blow my ears up just yet.” Jimmie answered. His voice steady and with his ever-present hint of amusement.

“I’m sorry” Daphne answered, anxiety in her voice. “I think I ran into a software issue here; can you check if the batteries ever got told we were in an emergency?”

“That would be weird, but I can do that, yeah. With a ship as old as this one, weird things always happen. It’ll take me a few minutes though”

Daphne felt herself relax at Jimmie’s steady tone. He was as calm as always. He could have been talking about a coffee machine that didn’t work properly instead of a critical failure of the ship, and he’d sound the same. She admired that about him, he was born for this kind of work. Like the astronauts she used to watch on the old documentaries she obsessively watched when she was just a kid. He was steady and unshakeable. Totally unlike her. Here she was, floating in the middle of a tiny room trying to contain a panic attack.

The comm went silent, if there was anything worse than being in a ship with no power and life support, it was being alone with her own thoughts in a ship with no power and life support. She checked her air bottle, it still had like half of its content. After that, she’d need to use her last one. And after that…. Daphne felt her usually steady hands start to tremble. Her heartbeat thudded too loudly in her ears, like a drum pounding out of sync with the quiet all around her. She took a shaky breath, but it didn’t seem to fill her lungs all the way. The walls seemed closer than they were a moment ago. She tried clenching and unclenching her fists, trying to ignore the knot in her chest. “Please, not now” she thought to herself. Her vision narrowed and her mind started racing, trying to keep up with the work she still needed to do.

“Hey kid, everything alright down there?” Jimmie asked. He waited for Daphne’s response.

“I’m… I’m here, I had a problem with my air bottle, it’s alright now”, daphne said, trying to hold back tears.

“You were, right. I checked the logs, and it turns out the operating system never sent the batteries the signal to kick in, you’ll have to reconnect all of them, and I’ll restart the system, that’ll get them working again.” He said, and then added “glad you got the air bottle thing sorted”.

Daphne frantically put all the cells in the array and signaled Jimmie to restart the system. One by one the ship came back to life. First, the light came on. then the air filters filled the ship with air once again. Their hum, once so mundane, now sounded like music to her.

Her relief wouldn’t last long, a red light started flashing on the battery console. Signaling a new issue, Daphne’s pulse quickened again.

“Jimmie, we have another problem” she said, her voice tight. “The emergency power grid isn’t reaching normal voltage levels”

Silence. Jimmie cursed softly on the other end, and then his voice came back as serious as ever. “Alright. Don’t panic. Let’s run through this one step at a time, this could be as simple as a small short circuit or loose cable. I’ll guide you through the checks, but we’ll need to work fast”

Daphne’s fingers curled up against the edge of her console. She was exhausted. Every part of her wanted to shut down all the noise and go cry into the nearest corner. But Jimmie’s voice grounded her again. Clenching her jaw, she set to work. Following every instruction to the letter.

“Got it!” she said suddenly, as she held a piece of loose wiring in her hand. With careful precision she fastened it back into its place, holding her breath as she waited for the console to respond. The emergency indicator blinked from red to green, and daphne let out a shaky sigh.

“Looks good on my end” Jimmie said. “You saved us a lot of trouble here today, kid”

She let herself sink back into the zero-g with a mix of relief and weariness. “let’s just hope the reactor is fixable, otherwise we’re toast”

“One step at a time” Jimmie replied. “For now, you did good, Head back and get a breather, you’ve earned it”

Daphne’s hands shook as she collected her tools and prepared to head back to the crew quarters. As the tension finally eased, exhaustion took its place. But a sense of pride steadied her. Whatever happened next, it couldn’t be worse than this, right?

Our goal is to help people make real-life connections through spontaneous, casual activities – think coffee meetups, casual pickleball games, or local pop-up events. Unlike traditional meetup platforms, we’re focused on lowering social pressure and encouraging authentic, low-key interactions.

# Here’s How We’re Positioning amiqo

* **Real-Life First** – We’re all about activity-based connections to help users form genuine, offline friendships and break away from endless screen time.
* **Simplified Meetup Experience** – amiqo is designed for small, low-pressure meetups rather than big, intimidating events. We want users to feel comfortable connecting with a few new people at a time.
* **Safe and Privacy-Focused** – Privacy is central to amiqo. We only share first names and limit profile visibility to confirmed attendees, creating a safe environment for real-life engagement.
* **Gamified Engagement** – Our “amiPet” companion grows as users connect in real life, making engagement both fun and rewarding.

# Our Marketing Questions 🔥

We’d love input from this community on a few key points:

1. **User Motivation** – What are effective ways to tap into the motivations of people seeking real-life connections? Any suggestions on the types of messaging or content that resonate most with this need?
2. **Positioning Strategy** – We’re marketing amiqo as a “better Meetup for small-group activities.” Is this enough to stand out, or should we explore a different angle?
3. **Feature Communication** – Are our core features (privacy-first, low-pressure meetups, amiPet gamification) clear and appealing from a user acquisition perspective?
4. **Content Strategy** – Any advice on social media or ad campaigns that could drive sign-ups for an app focused on real-life connections?

I just want to share what I'm seeing happen in this industry, and I'm curious if others are noticing the same things. 

As someone who started in POD back in 2017 and successfully transitioned to running my own manufacturing, I've watched the industry evolve from a promising business model to what I believe has become an unsustainable bubble. Here's why:

I'm still in many POD Facebook groups, and I've been watching with growing concern as complaints pile up across all major providers - Printful, Printify, Printed Mint, Swift POD, Gelato, Monster Digital, MWW, and others. The issues are consistent and widespread: orders not shipping on time, missing business branding on packaging, faulty printing with peeling designs and crooked prints, chemical smells on garments, stains on items, and dull ink. The lack of quality control has become glaringly obvious, and I see these same complaints echoed here on Reddit.

The market has become completely oversaturated, driven by ""POD gurus"" promising passive income and quick riches. They've convinced everyone that POD is an easy path to wealth, that anyone can become a successful business owner overnight. The reality? The only people getting consistently rich are the POD providers themselves, selling samples and subscriptions, and the gurus peddling courses and affiliate links. I constantly see posts from new store owners lamenting zero sales after months of operation.

The products themselves have become painfully generic and obviously POD - you can spot them from a mile away. What's worse, POD has essentially become the new fast fashion: cheap polyester and plastic products, shipped individually across the globe, packed in poly mailers. These items rarely last more than two years before being discarded, destined for landfills and thrift stores. The environmental impact is significant and unsustainable, and consumers are starting to take notice.

I believe we're approaching a breaking point. The mainstream POD providers can no longer maintain quality standards while handling the massive volume of orders. They're simply going through the motions, rushing to ship items as quickly as possible with minimal oversight. As customers increasingly associate POD with low quality, they'll become less willing to pay the prices sellers need to charge for even a modest profit. 

The situation is further complicated by POD providers now offering risky products like coffee, candles, and supplements. They're not educating their sellers about the liability risks of selling these items, and when something inevitably goes wrong, the POD providers won't be held responsible - the sellers will.

As someone who's no longer in the POD space but watching from the outside, I'm curious to hear current sellers' perspectives. Having moved on to traditional manufacturing, maybe I'm out of the loop - but these warning signs seem impossible to ignore.

1gj3gbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MylarBagPrinting/comments/1gj3gbx/custom_mylar_bag_printing/,Custom Mylar Bag Printing,"Packaging does more than just hold a product—it tells a story, sings a brand's anthem, if you will. And in the case of custom Mylar bags, the plot thickens. Have you ever considered how something as simple as a bag can grip a customer’s attention, maybe even enough to seal a sale? There’s a charm to those glossy or matte, light-resistant, oxygen-blocking Mylar bags, especially when they’re tailored to embody a brand’s spirit.

But why Mylar? Why custom? And why go through the trouble of printing when plain ol' bags would suffice? Let's dive into these sleek little pouches, exploring the whys, the hows, and the what-could-be's of [custom Mylar bag printing](https://www.brandmydispo.com/collections/custommylarbags).

# The Unbreakable Appeal of Custom Mylar Bags

* **Durability that Doesn’t Flinch**: Mylar bags are tough, not just physically but in function. They protect what lies within like a fortress, keeping moisture, light, and air at bay—essential qualities if you’re dealing with food, cannabis, or even cosmetics. These bags are the guardians of freshness.
* **First Impressions Count, Right?**: Visualize your bag glimmering on the store shelf, whispering “pick me” to every passerby. Custom printing lets a brand sparkle through, transforming each bag from basic packaging into a tiny, effective billboard.
* **Endless Personalization**: Think about it. How often do you find a piece of packaging that fits *perfectly*? Custom Mylar bags come in an array of shapes and sizes, from pocket-sized for edible goodies to hefty for bulkier items. You have the say in how snugly they fit your product.

# Materials and the Magic of Printing Techniques

* **Polyester Marvel**: Mylar itself is a unique beast—a durable polyester film often layered with aluminum, giving it that shimmer and making it impenetrable to the elements.
* **Choosing Your Print Style**:
   * **Digital Dazzle**: This method is quick and sharp, ideal for vivid, small-batch projects.
   * **Rotogravure Grandeur**: This one’s for the heavy-hitters—high-volume, high-detail printing that’s like bringing a magnifying glass to quality.
   * **Flexographic Simplicity**: For those designs with fewer details, flexography gets it done efficiently and economically.

# Crafting a Design that Wows

When it comes to design, here’s where imagination gets to run wild. Every color, every texture, every tiny detail plays a role in capturing the heart (and wallet) of your audience.

* **Pick Your Finish**: Matte or glossy? Shiny gloss screams ""high-end,"" while a matte finish is sleek, whispering sophistication. Pick your aesthetic weapon wisely.
* **Special Touches**:
   * **Embossing & Foil Stamping**: For those who crave a tactile experience, these techniques are like candy for the fingers, giving your logo a little 3D pop.
   * **Clear Windows**: Sometimes, a sneak peek is all a customer needs. But beware—exposing the inside can diminish that mysterious allure. It’s a choice between curiosity and transparency.
* **Colors that Speak**: Color is everything. A brand isn’t just a logo; it’s the hues that remind customers of your story. Don’t just print your logo on any shade; pick a palette that’s distinctively you.

# The Steps to Crafting Your Perfect Mylar Bag

Creating the *perfect* custom Mylar bag might seem daunting, but it’s easier than wrestling with your morning coffee machine. Here’s a roadmap for making it happen:

* **Know What You Want**: Are you hoping to attract a specific audience? Have a budget? Need something that’s kid-proof, adult-approved, and weather-resistant? Define your goals before you dive in.
* **Choose the Right Partner**: Don’t settle. Your Mylar bag printer should offer quality, transparency, and options galore. They should understand that these bags represent *you*. It’s worth finding someone who shares your passion for the details.
* **Craft Your Vision**: Collaborate with a designer, or use online tools if you’ve got a clear picture in mind. Remember to keep file formats crisp, colors true, and legal text (yes, sometimes you need it) in small, unobtrusive fonts.
* **Ordering & Logistics**: Some manufacturers have minimum orders, which might work out perfectly if you’re gearing up for a large launch or festival. Others offer smaller runs, allowing for flexibility.

# Where Custom Mylar Bags Shine

It’s not just cannabis or food that gets to enjoy Mylar's magic. These bags have infiltrated industries left and right, from health supplements to pet treats.

* **Cannabis Companies**: The cannabis world loves Mylar bags for their odor-blocking, child-resistant features. From buds to edibles, Mylar bags are essential in legal markets.
* **Food & Spices**: Imagine coffee beans kept as fresh as the day they were picked or spices that make the nose tingle when opened. Mylar bags do just that.
* **Pharmaceuticals & Supplements**: Some items need tamper-proof, secure packaging—especially things people ingest. Mylar bags provide safety along with shelf appeal.
* **Pet Products and Beyond**: Even dog treats deserve a dash of Mylar magic. Whether for odor-blocking or keeping food fresh, Mylar bags serve a wide audience.

# Budget, Bulk, and Brand Recognition

* **Budget-Friendly Options**: Costs vary depending on complexity, size, and volume. A small investment in custom printing can make your packaging look ten times more premium.
* **Order Requirements**: Minimum order quantities (MOQs) can sometimes limit smaller businesses, but often lead to cheaper prices per unit if you’re ready to go big.
* **The Power of Custom Packaging**: When a customer sees your logo, your colors, and your designs on the shelf, it imprints in their mind. Custom bags aren’t just containers; they’re ambassadors, speaking your brand’s language.

# A Glimpse into the Future of Mylar Bags

The future looks bright—and eco-friendly—for Mylar bags.

* **Eco-Conscious Choices**: Sustainable printing and recyclable materials are on the rise. Some brands now offer biodegradable options for those aiming to reduce their carbon footprint.
* **Interactive Packaging**: Imagine QR codes on your bag, unlocking videos, recipes, or games. It’s an instant connection from package to user, giving a new layer of engagement.
* **Personalized Packaging**: With digital printing, companies can experiment with seasonal or limited-run designs to keep things fresh and enticing. For smaller brands, short-run printing makes personalization achievable.

Let’s be real—custom Mylar bag printing isn’t just packaging; it’s branding, storytelling, and sometimes, even art. Why settle for plain when you can have a vibrant, durable bag that whispers your brand’s tale to every passerby?",1,1730685378.0,MylarBagPrinting,0,1.0,False

This is going to be a long one, so you'll have to bear with me while I try and explain everything. But there is a TLDR at the bottom if you want to read that instead.

Okay, so I was probably around 10/11 years old the first time I remember the boy turning up. It was the middle of summer and my friends, and I were swimming in a lake in one of my parents' fields. I grew up in a small farmers town, with a population of no more than 200 and so everyone knew everyone. There were two schools in the town, one for boys and one for girls, I'm not sure why they split them by gender, and I'm pretty sure both have merged now, but that's what it was like when I lived there.

I'm going to tell it how I remember it happening, but my friend who was there at the time remembers it slightly differently than I do.

So, as I was saying, my friends (I think it was about 4 of us in total) and I were swimming in the lake at the bottom of one of my parents' fields. It was about a 15-minute walk from my main house.

We had been playing there for a while, when we heard someone calling to us. We looked over and saw the boy standing at the edge of the lake, completely naked. Once we noticed him, he shouted if he could play with us.

He looked to be around the same age as us, maybe a little older but not by much. He was super pale, like white pale. I remember being amazed and kind of jealous of his super bright green eyes. He also had shoulder length white-blond hair, like Draco Malfoy blond.

I looked to my friends, and we said yeah, and he came in the lake with us. None of us recognised him. Which as I said was weird because we had all lived in this tiny town for our whole lives and everyone basically knew everyone living there.

He introduced himself as Richard, but he said he prefers if we called him Richie, so we did. I remember asking Richie where he was from, but he would go all awkward and would never give a straight answer.

Anyway, after a while more of playing in the lake Richie seemed fun and I invited him to come back to my house for supper, he straight away said he would love to come, and my friend was like ""Don't you need to ask your mum?"" to which Richie said something like ""Oh she won't mind.”

Remember how I said Richie was completely naked, well that wasn't so strange. In fact, I'm pretty sure we all were. My friends and I were all boys, and we would skinny dip in the lake normally, so it didn't stick out to me when he first arrived like that. But what did stick out to me was when we got out of the lake dried and dressed ourselves, Richie had no clothes with him to get dressed into. Which I remember thinking was super weird, but he said something like ""Oh I must have forgot to bring them."" Which again, I thought was very weird, like how do you forget your clothes. I wasn't sure how my parents would react to me bringing home a naked boy, so I gave him my briefs and my overshirt to put on. But yeah, that stuck out as very odd.

My friends went back home, and Richie and I went to my house. My dad was like “where’s his clothes?” I just made something up. I’m pretty sure I said something like his clothes got wet, so we left them in the sun to dry.

I got him some trousers to put on. We ate supper, which I remember him having 3 or 4 plates of. As I said, Richie is a super skinny boy, I was pretty small and skinny at the time. But he was definitely skinnier than I was, so I was confused how he ate so much lol.

Richie was super polite and sweet to everyone while he was at my house. After supper I took him upstairs to my room and we played on my Nintendo 64 together. He had never seen one before and was super amazed by it. At the time I thought he had never seen one before and was super amazed by it. At the time I thought he had never seen one because they were so old, this was 2010. But my family was poor and that's all I had. It started to get dark, and I asked him if he wanted to sleep over, he was really excited by that and said yeah. I checked with my parents, but I knew they wouldn't mind because they were both super drunk. So, we continued playing on N64 until it was super late.

After a while, I said it was time that we went to bed as I was tired, but I don't remember him seeming tired at all. Richie asked if he could shower before as we had been playing in my fields and he was really muddy. As he was showering, I made my bed for us and put a movie on the TV for us to watch as we went to sleep, and I got into bed. Richie came in like 5 minutes later and was completely naked again. I was like ""did you walk from the bathroom like that?"" he was like yeah and didn't seem to care at all, so even though I thought it was strange I didn't say anything. He got into my bed, I asked him if he wanted any pyjamas and he said no it was too hot, which to be fair I do remember it being really hot that day.

I had a Scooby Doo movie on, and he was really excited by it, and didn't know anything about them, which I guess isn't too weird. But looking back, he didn't seem to know any pop culture stuff at all, I mean, we were pretty behind the times in my small town, but we still knew most pop culture.

I had slept in quite a lot the next day, but when I woke up Richie wasn't in my room. I went and asked my mum if she'd seen him and she said he left early that morning after his parents rang our house, how they knew he was with us or where to ring I'm still not sure. Richie had taken some shorts from my room because my mom said he couldn't leave without clothes on.

I was a little disappointed he left without me, or at least without saying goodbye or without leaving any way of contacting him again. He turned up again a couple days later when my friends and I were swimming in the lake again. This time he brought clothes, but I'm pretty sure he only brought some briefs and a shirt with no pants. Which again, I thought was weird.

Over the next year, him and I became super close. We were like brothers. Over the year, I asked if I could see his home or meet his family. But any time I asked anything personal about him, he would go awkward and not want to talk about it. Or he would just change the subject. But I could see it made him feel uncomfortable, so I didn’t push him to tell me. He did tell me he was homeschooled, which I thought was cool. Because I’m my mind that meant no school.

As I said, we became really close over the year. I felt like he was more than a friend to me. It’s difficult to explain, it’s almost like we clicked from the first time we met. We became close really quick, and I felt like I could tell him anything and he would always help and support me. He helped me through so many hard times, and he definitely encouraged me to be a better person. It was almost as if he could sense when I was going through anything.  For example, when my grandma passed away, I went out into my fields to cry as I didn't want to do it in front of my family. But after sitting down in some random place Richie turned up and sat next to me, he said some things that I remember helping me a lot. When I asked him how he found me he said that we were just on a walk.

Not too long after this, he just vanished. It had been a little over a year since the first time he appeared at the lake. It was around September the year after, so it had been around a year and 2/3 months. He never turned up again, never said goodbye, never left a trace. I was massively upset, I really really missed him. I would walk around the fields looking for him and I would hang out by the lake where we first met. Hoping that he would turn up, but he never did again.

I still don't know what happened to him, I've tried searching social media for him but with no luck and since he would never tell me that much about his life I don't have that much to go on. I asked my parents what they remember of him. They said they remember him being odd, and that they were unsure about him at first, especially how he had a tendency to strip naked whenever he felt like it. But they also said that he and I were inseparable and wherever I was he was sure to be found there too. They said they remember me being heartbroken when he stopped appearing, and they weren't sure whether they should call the police about him being gone, but they never did. (I kind of wish they did)

I suppose this is a long shot, but if you're reading this Richie, reach out to me. I'd love to speak to you again and get some answers to all the weird things about you.

It’s completely possible that there isn’t anything paranormal about Richie, but it is definitely strange.

TLDR: A boy turned up out of nowhere in my small town. He was quite weird and didn't know much about pop culture. Him and I became super close friends really quickly and spent almost every day together. Until one day, after about a year, he disappeared. Never turned up to hang out with me again.  I didn't have any way of contacting him as he would always avoid answering any personal questions.

UPDATE 1.1: I am visiting my parents for a couple weeks; I will search the house for any photos us Richie and I that I could share here. Though, with 7 older brothers and a lot of family photos I'm not sure I'll find anything. Also, there is a fun day at the local church to celebrate the schools breaking up for summer holiday. As suggested by a commenter, I am going to attend the coffee morning where all the old people who live in the village go. Even if this means waking up at 7am. I am going to be asking around to see if anyone remembers Richie. I will update this thread tomorrow if I find anything!

Thank you everyone for your help!

UPDATE 1.2: I have asked around at my local church today, no one seemed to remember Richie. I started to lose a little hope. But word must have spread around that I was looking for someone. Because an old lady (I'll call her Sharon in this), who I know, but haven't ever really spoken to before, came up to me. She says she thinks she might know Richie's maternal great aunt. She is going to try and find the contact details for me so I can reach out and see if the great aunt has any info on Richie. Sharon says if Richie is does belong to the family she's thinking of, then he would have lived at a cottage around an hour and 15-minute walk from the main village. She said the cottage is secluded, with no neighbours. Sharon has no idea why they disappeared, but she said she isn't that close to Richie's great aunt. I hope this is good news, I might actually be a step closer to finding Richie again. I'll update with anymore news if I find any. I'm hoping that this possible aunt is still alive and hasn't changed contact details. Wish me luck!

UPDATE 1.3: I have contacted Richie's potential great aunt (PGA for short lol), with no luck. I called the number that Sharon gave to me a couple times. With no answer, though I have left a message explaining who I am. I am sent a letter first class to the address that Sharon gave me as well, which should get there tomorrow or the day after. Hopefully the PGA is still living at the address, and I am able to get some answers. In the letter I also explained why I was interested in contacting her, and I gave my phone number if she would like to call me instead of writing back. I will update as soon as have anything new. Oh, and one more thing. I visited the cottage where Sharon thought Richie could have been living. The cottage is abandoned and run down. Seems likely that he could have been living here. It gave off massive creepy vibes though.

UPDATE 1.4: I have heard back from the PGA; I'll name her Jane. Someone suggested that I check if the number was linked to any apps like WhatsApp. It was, and I reached out to Jane on there. This seemed to do the trick and she messaged me back relatively quickly. After describing Richie to her, she said pretty confidently that she is related to Richie. This is where things take a bad turn. Jane hasn't been in contact with Richie's family for many years. But she does have the phone number of Richie's older sister. I had no idea he even had any siblings at all. Jane insinuated that I won't find what I'm looking for when contacting Richie's sister. I fear the worst, it seems as though something has happened to Richie. Jane told me that Richie's sister will be able to tell me more, gave me her number and then hung up the phone. I'm incredibly anxious to reach out to Richie's sister. This could be the end to the search that has taken me so long. But I fear that it isn't the ending that I have dreamed of. I will update this thread once I know more.

[**UPDATE: When I was around 10 I met a strange boy who seemed to appear from nowhere. He and I became super close friends but after about a year he disappeared. I never found a way of contacting him again.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/olfakz/update_when_i_was_around_10_i_met_a_strange_boy/) \- 16 July 2021

This is an update to my original post from a couple days ago. Which can be found here Though my original post was only around 4 days ago, that is eternity in reddit time. So I am not sure if anyone will even care about this update.

First and foremost, I want to thank each and everyone one of you who have helped with through this process and have helped me find closure on my childhood best-friend and my first and only true love.

This journey has been difficult, many years I have searched for answers on where Richie is now. Sadly, it is not good news. Deep down, I think I feared and perhaps avoided searching for Richie in case this was the outcome.

With the help of everyone here and so many lovely commenters, I tracked down a distant relative to Richie. Who put me in contact with Richie's older sister. A sister that I did not know existed. For the sake of clarity I will name the sister Sarah. Sarah helped put into context Richie, his odd behaviour, his unwillingness to show me his home and his disappearance.

Sarah and Richie both suffered abuse and neglect at the hands of their father. Their father, who suffered with severe mental health issues and drug-related problems for most of his adult life. Their father was terrified of the outside world, and thus kept them secluded away in secret. According to Sarah, their father was convinced that the world was months away from ending at any given time. He was convinced that the devil was planning to take over his mind and body. And was convinced that Jesus had spoken to him, and told him the only way to keep him and his family safe was to keep them secluded from the outside world. Sarah shared that their father would not often be physically abusive, which I suppose is of some relief.

Richie and his family would move often throughout his childhood. Never staying in one place for too long as his father feared that the devil would soon find them. Sarah said they were most likely moved in the middle of the night with no forewarning. Though she can't remember the specific time they were moved from my town. This helps to explain how Richie seemed to appear one day, and disappear 15 months later.

Richie passed away at age 15, around 2 and a half years after vanishing from my town. Sarah struggled to go into the details of Richie's death and I didn't want to push her into sharing something that was painful for her. Though it seemed that Richie took his own life. Sarah told me that Richie would often speak of me, and the time we spent together. And that all Richie ever wanted to do was to come back and find me. Sadly, he never managed that. She said she thought that I was just imaginary. She isn't sure how Richie would sneak out of the house to meet with me, but said that their father would keep them locked in their rooms for days and sometimes weeks at a time.

Sarah told me she has a collection of Richie's diaries, which I do remember him writing occasionally. She has offered to send them to me, which is lovely of her. She told me that a lot of the writing is about me, about our time together, about how he wanted to find me again so we could run away together. Again she never thought I was a real person. Hearing that was so incredibly bittersweet. I look forward to reading those diaries, even though it will be incredibly difficult at the same time.

She said she is glad that Richie managed to have an impact on someone on this world. I wish that I was able to express the impact that Richie had on my life. I wish I could tell Richie the impact he had on my life. I want everyone to know Richie. I want everyone to know what an amazing, kind and beautiful person Richie was.

This post is difficult for me to write. Deep down, I think that I resisted searching for Richie more in case this was the outcome. Sarah told me a lot more information, but I've decided to leave out most to respect her privacy. Sarah is away and safe from her father, which I am so glad about.

Again, I just want to express how thankful I am for all of you who have helped. For all of you who have offered emotional support. Thank you so much.

Richie, I love you. I'm sorry I couldn't help you. I'm sorry I didn't pick up on the signals that you were in danger. I hope you can forgive me. Richie you were the only true friend I've ever had, it's so hard for me to write this. I feel so sick that I didn't do more. Richie, I want you to know you saved me so many times throughout my life. So many low moments in my life have been helped because of the memories of you. I am so sorry I wasn't there for you the same way you were there for me.

I love you so much Richie.

[***New Update*** **When I was around 10 I met a strange boy who seemed to appear from nowhere, him and I became super close friends but after about a year he disappeared. I never found a way of contacting him again + Updates.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/til9yi/new_update_when_i_was_around_10_i_met_a_strange/) \- 20 March 2022

Hello everyone,

Almost one year ago I made a reddit post searching for answers about a childhood friend of mine that went missing, it received a moderate amount of attention and with the people of reddit's help I was able to track down the relatives of my missing friend. I posted this under a different, now deleted account, however I have sent the mods of this subreddit proof of me being the OOP I deleted the reddit account because honestly I didn't want to think about what happened to Richie anymore as it was too painful for a long time after I discovered the truth.

Recently that post has resurfaced on this subreddit and so I thought I'd give you all an update on where I am today and how I'm doing as well as how Sarah is doing. It still pains me to think about Richie, and think about how I could have and should have helped him and how I failed to save him. It does really hurt to look back on it. I really don't have many friends and I suffer from pretty bad anxiety, and I just wish I had Richie here with me. Sarah and I still occasionally talk, but not really as often as I wish we could. I have met her IRL once, which was nice.

I hope that me posting this update is alright on this subreddit, it just seemed to me that so many were touched by Richie's story that I thought I would put this out there and I'm happy to answer questions of anyone who has them.

 

Update 3.1:

This post got a lot of replies, and I am trying to make my way through and answer as much as I can. I didn't think this post would get so much attention, especially since this was posted relatively recently. To answer a couple of the common questions: Yes, I am currently in therapy. I started it not too long ago along with some medication as I have suffered for a while with severe anxiety.

I am currently requesting permission from Sarah before I post any of Richie's journal entries, as I feel she should have final say on if she wants those out on the internet.

No, I am not writing a book about Richie. No, this is not a promotion for a book. If anyone was to write a book about Richie and his life I would think it should be Sarah, however she does not have any interest in sharing her story. She would much rather leave the past in the past, and honestly I can't blame her.

It really breaks my heart that there are so many people in here sharing that they knew a Richie, or they were a Richie. I feel like so many children, even now, go under the radar, the lives they live and the abuse they receive with no one there to help. It hurts to think that there could have been so many with us today that have sadly passed on and are no longer with us. I think everyone has a right to be remembered and I am so glad that Richie has had an impact on so many people here.

Also I'm sorry if I don't respond to a comment, there are a lot on here that I thought would be too difficult to respond to. I can say a million times that I shouldn't feel guilty, and I know that also. But it is very hard not to, and it's very hard to hear that I did all I could do when Richie isn't around anymore. That might sound mopey or ungrateful, I am grateful of all the love I have been sent. I am just not entirely sure if I deserve it.

 

[# Update 4.0 (new update):](https://www.reddit.com/u/OneQueasyDude-V2/s/LDrdvdtJcU) - 4 April 2024

Hello everyone,

This is strange for me to be back (on my third account no less), but I just wanted to give a short update about my life and the life of me and ""Sarah"" now. The day I created this account u/OneQueasyDude-V2 was Richie's birthday. It has been almost 10 years since he committed suicide. And though I think of him less now than I did before. I still think of him. It seems insane to me that it has been almost 3 years since I posted the original post. Sarah and I speak, but still not often. We met up on his birthday last year, but we didn't this year, the year before that I didn't even know it was his birthday. It would have been around the time I posted the first BORU post. Sarah is doing really well, at least from what she tells me, but again we aren't close. 

Sarah and I love the fact that this subreddit keeps the memory of Richie alive, she's really grateful that so many people know her brother's story. I encouraged her to make a post, but she said having that many eyes on her would be far too scary. I can understand that. I am very grateful to the Mods of this Subreddit, who in the few encounters I have had with them, they seem like genuine and kind people. 

I have had so many people reach out to me over the years and say thank you as they 'were a Richie'. I think that's really sweet; I hope many others share their stories of Richies. Richies deserve to be remembered. 

I don't believe in an afterlife, not anymore maybe I did at one point. Richie was a real one, in every way. So, I am glad that his memory can at least live on.

Sarah did not give me permission to post Richie's journals. Which I am glad about, because that would have been an invasion of his privacy too far. He has some very personal inner thoughts in them, and sometimes even I feel weird reading. You can very much tell they were written by someone who was in a lot of pain. And it is so sad for me to see them get more and more dark as he grows up. It makes me still upset that I couldn't help him in the way that he helped me. One page I will always cherish is a drawing he made of us both, labelled 'love'.

I have spoke to some friends but am wondering if this is just adulthood or something else?

Background: I sleep 8 hours a night, I go to bed at midnight and wake up at 8am. I work around 8-9 hours a day remotely from my computer. I don't drink alcohol or smoke weed or cigarettes and I go to the gym 3x a week. I am single with no kids. I do occasionally vape nicotine from a low nicotine vape.

I have around 2 coffees a day before 1pm and then switch to tea, and I eat pretty healthy. Don't drink pop or snack on sweets etc.

I don't know I feel like I'm healthy and in good shape but every day I'm just tired. I usually get a burst of energy/good mood around 11am-1pm but am tired the rest of the day. I do normal social stuff like coffee or dinner with friends a few times a week and see my family, go on some dates, I have some hobbies I like.

I actually like my work and overall I think I'm pretty happy and lead a good life. Is it normal to be tired a lot of the time as an adult? Maybe I'm overthinking it but I wish I had more energy/could sustain being enthusiastic for longer periods. I cut out alcohol a while back and used it to kind of be more lively and have a ""fun time"". I am definitely happier without alcohol but there are definitely less highs I would say without drinking, although I never felt good about it after/the next morning.

Like I have some friends who will go bike riding or something after work and seem like all energetic or want to see a movie in the evening etc. and I'm like uh no I'm exhausted, but I don't really have a reason to be? I don't think I'm depressed at all. I don't even have kids or a high stress job so it doesn't seem like I should be tired all the time. I had some blood tests not too long ago and didn't have any health issues or off levels of anything.

Does anyone have tips to be more energetic or less tired throughout the day? I feel like I have a pretty solid routine/base of health so I don't know if this is just normal aging/adulthood/working or if it's me. I get energetic or enthusiastic for short bursts but cant sustain it, then I kinda crash. I can't really find anything specific with my diet or routine to associate it with.

my mom is 64 and it seems like she's energetic all day long. she doesn't work anymore but she's basically out all day doing stuff and with friends. she goes to bed early but it feels like she has way more energy than me throughout the day lol. she appears to run a million errands in a day. if I have to go return something at a mall, I'll be tired after lol.

1gj3arz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1gj3arz/defeated_by_gi_symptoms/,Defeated by GI symptoms ,"44m SW 248 GW 190 CW 212

Started mid-May and had minimal side effects the first seven weeks, little fatigue and nausea but that was it. Lost 15 pounds and was super happy. Week 8 started to get sulfur burps. Went up to the next dosage and did one dose after and had three of the worst weeks of my life. I lost 15 lbs in 15 days and could barely eat. Was up most nights with 2-4 hours of the worst diarrhea I've ever experienced (and Ive done colonoscopy prep) along with awful gas and cramping. I stopped the medication completely bc nothing anyone suggested stopped my symptoms - gas-X, Pepto, Imodium, Alka Seltzer, nothing made a dent.

I'd get sick on days I had nothing to eat beyond some plain tuna and a few crackers, or half a can of plain soup and some apple sauce. I'd already pretty much stopped all red meat, alcohol, and full fat dairy along with sweets (just didn't want them as the medication was doing it's thing.)

After cold turkey stopping the medicaition, I gained 5 lbs over the next month, mostly water weight, and then ramped back up again on the same schedule as before. This time I only made it 7 weeks before bam, same symptoms. Usually it starts around 4-5pm - burning pain in my stomach, then gas, and eventually hours of diarrhea. I had to take a PTO day last week it's been so bad.

I've been taking fiber, probiotics, vitamin b and d, nothing matters. I stopped drinking coffee. Friday I had no breakfast and a 200 calorie lunch and I was STILL sick that night. I was able to eat about 600 calories yesterday and 900 today. Tomorrow would be my scheduled dose but I need to skip it - I have an event this weekend and I can't risk being sick (honestly I'm already concerned I may be even without any more medication.)

Is there anything else I've not thought of? Is this medication just not for me? I followed the suggested ramp up schedule of .25 / .5 for weeks 1-4 and 5-8 respectively and have like quintuple checked that I'm dosing correctly, so it isn't that.

I guess I could try staying at the first level dose much longer but I don't feel much appetite suppression until I ramp up to the next level, which makes me ill. ",1,1730684882.0,Semaglutide,3,1.0,False

“Tell me, have you ever heard of a Boltzmann brain? It’s a thought experiment that proposes that your entire life is a hallucination created by a brain spontaneously generated in the void. That no one except you is truly sentient. When I first heard it, well, I was terrified. I was already in with the fourteen at the time. I had become a master hacker, and was in the process of turning my apartment building into a panopticon and making myself the warden. But for all the knowledge the Ceaseless Watcher could grant me, it could not prove that I was not a Boltzmann brain. I began to panic. If I could not prove that everyone around me was sentient, then how could I prove that I was sentient? How could I prove that I had any control over anything at all?

…Then, a woman came to me in a coffee shop i frequent. She told me the truth. I wasn’t sentient. No one was. She told me what the Mother had in store for me. I accepted my role immediately.

I’m not hurting anyone. After all, no one here is truly sentient. We are all puppets pulled on strings, all thought up by a Boltzmann brain. I don’t know if I’m the brain. I don’t think so.

After all, the Mother has much in store for me. And who am I to deny the Boltzmann brain thinking me up?”

I'm a 21 y.o. man. An international student in a european country, originally from the Middle East. (If these info matter at all)

I saw a girl many times on our campus(2 years ago). And i really liked her, but i never asked her out. 
At the time, i was a skinny boy, who hated himself, dealing with anxiety and depression,  which are being treated, and now i care a bit more about my looks and hairs, and i feel i look way better.

Anyway, we made several eye contacts throughout this time. But since  i never introduced myself to her, i feel like maybe i was some sort of intrusion to her privacy? I wasn't staring or something, but i would notice her.

This summer, i met her on the street close to the campus, and i buit up my courage to finally walk up to her.

I told her, "" i've seen her in the campus, and i was wondering if i can take her out for a coffee.""
She replied so happily with excitement, and even she initiated many questions and short convo in the 2-3minutesd that we talked over there on the street.
At the end she said that she will go to her hometown for a few weeks and we can meet after she comes back.
She said 2 times ""oh this is so nice""

I took her ig and and i messaged her 3-4 days later. About a recent post of hers(just to initiate the conversation). She seen the message after 3 weeks and never replied. After a week i sent her another message asking how are u feeling. And after a week i didn't get a reply. I unfollowed and delted my messages.

My conclusion was:
"" That's a probably rude, but clear NO."" 
OR 
""She wants me to chase or sth. But i wont for 2 reasons, first i dont knoe where to draw the line, so i dont want to annoy/harass someone, and second, for the self respect""


But now, we a have a class at the same time (different rooms) and i see her heavy stares to me. What is that??!!

Only few things come to my mind:

She just dislikes me. it's like a look of victory  after rejecting.
- checking if im looking?
- a permission so that i can go further and maybe talk to her again? (Ask whatsupp, shy didn't u reply, in a friendly manner).
* i just dont want to bother her and cause any discomfort.

U might say ""move on,"" and i totally agree with that. 
But the stupid, dreamy, young me has dreamt about her for so long. I feel creeped out when i look at these thoughts from a 3rd person pov.
I dont find anyone as beautiful as her anymore, the facial structure is just, different, she is just... perfect. Astonishingly attractive in her own way. Like an angel. And not conventioally, but in her own way.

I had a very different dream about her last night, which made me write this post.
She was stating the reasons why she backed off, but she was hugging me, even kissed me on the cheeks(face), although i was so reluctant to sit next to her and talk to her in the dream.

I don't want to annoy her, but i want to have a chance. Im already Middle Eastern, so im also scared of the stereotype, which is out of my countrol.


Im sorry for rambling and writing such a long post, but i didn't want to miss something important. Thank you for your patience.

Ultimately not that big of an issue in the grand scheme of things but I take my Dog through my local coffee shop often to see his friends and get a pup cup. 

At the moment it’s right under his chin and against his neck when he sticks his head out. And then he puts his paws up on it to stand out further.. I should note, he is properly restrained to prevent falling out, and we are doing training, but he is an excitable guy.

I actually just had to get my previous car’s back window repaired after it accidentally wasn’t rolled all the way and he stood on the window, pushing it down into the door.

Want the guy to be comfortable and not risk the window being pushed down again. 

I’m curious if I can have the regulator (hope that’s the right term lol) changed out for one that would allow the back windows to roll fully down. And if so, what type of shop would do that procedure? Not sure if my usual place would do the swap or not.

It is almost always low when I check it at this time. Yesterday was really bad. I drank a bunch of iced coffee (the coffee mate brand caramel flavor so definitely NOT lacking any sugar there) throughout the day before my spouse checked my sugar for me. It was in the 40s.

I finally started to feel better awhile later and by the time I went to bed, after having dinner (indian tacos), it was up to 94. 

 I usually eat twice a day. What I can make is somewhat limited as I live in a motel currently,  but we try to do as much home cooked meals as we can. We try to have meat and vegetable each night,  and usually some type of potato, noodles, bread, something of that sort. I drink soda or juice maybe a couple of times a month. I don't normally drink coffee. My normal drinks are water, raspberry tea (sometimes with a splash of creamer), and electrolytes.

So I thought I should write something to document my memory and am hoping it may help the community for future excursions. Any questions please feel free to ask.

Lighterpack link: https://lighterpack.com/r/xus022


Some background context:

I am a 32M based in Sydney Australia. I work full time 9-5 job (i.e., not one of those super athletes who can run the UTMB, at least not yet). I would say I’m reasonably fit and my “comfort” hikes are 20km – 25km ish with 1000 – 1500m elevation gain. Normally I can conquer these within 4 – 6 hours (i.e., I normally hike at 3.5-6km/h if the terrain is not particularly tricky). I’m reasonably good with ascends but not so much with descends (especially sloppy/wet rocks)
After a few attempts, I realise I don’t like (or hate) backpacking. I want my backpack to be as light as possible so it took me a while to dial it down. My philosophy of doing the TMB is also taking as little as possible as long as it won’t put me in serious risk. Additionally, I have never done serious hikes for more than 2 days.

My wife and I were going to the Europe for 2 months (after all this is a 20-hour one way flight + connection time) and she’s not a hiker so I had to do this myself. As such, I want to finish this asap so that we can embark our journal sooner (including spending some time in Courmayeur afterwards). Initially I planned a 6-day TMB itinerary including 2x 30km back-to-back hikes (day 2 from Auberge de la Balme to Maison Vieille and day 3 Maison Vieille to La Peule). Later on, I thought it might just be easier that we visit Courmayeur while I was doing the TMB (so that she took the bus to Courmayeur). On this basis, I booked an additional day at Refugio Bertone so that my 3rd day will be split into 1x 10km day (from Maison Vieille to Refugio Bertone) and 1x 23km day. I booked all these in Nov 2023 (i.e., 10 months before my attempt)

In February, my wife also decided to do the Courmayeur to Les Houches section with me. I had to cancel my La Peule booking and replaced with a hotel in Ferret because La Peule was fully booked. The planning was largely based on Jeff Pelletier fast packing video (it was a 4.5-day itinerary, so I dialled it down by 15% per day, knowing that I’m nowhere as competent as they are). My goal was to do around 8-10 hours of hiking per day plus 1-2 hours of rest time so that I can start around 6am and finish around 3-4 pm.

I have also planned the following variants:

Col de Tricot
Col des Fours
Col Sapin (didn’t do it due to the weather)
Fenetre d’Arpette
Les Grands
Lac Blanc

Of all these, Col des Fours, Fenetre d’Arpette and Les Grands are the “non-negotiables” as they can greatly shave off the distance. Others are “nice to haves”.


Thoughts (overall):

It was indeed very challenging, especially given the distance I have to cover per day and my fitness level. I was hoping to give myself a “little” challenging but it was indeed more than what I was hoping for. It would have been much easier if I can shave off 5 km per day. Additionally, because there aren’t a lot of tall mountains in Sydney, I don’t have a lot of experience by doing say 1000m non-stop up or down hikes. Most continuous climbing in Sydney is around 100 – 300m (with very few exceptions of 600m but these are not close by where I live). Total elevation gains/losses are somewhat “delusional” as climbing one 1200m mountain then going down is very different from climbing 6x 200m mountains. This is my biggest take-away and like everyone else said – know your capabilities.

Be responsible and keep being responsible – I made a few decisions that almost put myself in danger, so it is very important to not making stupid decisions (including at the planning phase too).

The terrain (especially the variants) is somewhat challenging as well (more challenging than I thought). I knew Fenetre d’Arpette is challenging so that is not a surprise. However, most variants are very rocky (especially with loose slippery rocks). This was not something I’m accustomed to, so my speed was way lower than I was hoping for (I was hoping for 3.5km/hr but I was mostly doing 2.5km-3km/hr).

I don’t like the huts at all. They are inevitable as I don’t want to carry my camping gears. However, the whole experience was not enjoyable. The sleeping condition was shit (people really snore), the food was shit (it is bundled and mostly vegetarian), they are not flexible at all (you have to have your meal at the scheduled time. I don’t normally eat dinner but I don’t have any other choice. I want to start early but some huts won’t provide early breakfast).


Thoughts (gears)

As you can tell, I have carried the bare minimums and it works fine.

The Wilit sunhoodie is not a comfortable hoodie but it is cheap and got the work done just fine.

Patagonia Torrentshell is a trusty rain jacket that kept my main body dry during a 10-hour thunderstorm (the sleeves were wet out. I don’t know if it is because the waterproofing is gone or it leaked through somewhere).

Merrell AP5 is wonderful – stayed intact for the whole hike including all my later hikes in the Europe (it has 1700km hiking/walking distance before I retired it).
Decathlon MT500 pants is amazing. The only issue is the pocket – it developed a hole prematurely (I wouldn’t say this is a coincidence as both of my pairs have the same problem).

I used my merino buff as a towel as well – not great but it gets things done.

I used my alpha direct 90 as an insulation piece for after hike cool down period as well as a base layer when I washed my sunhoodie. It kept me warm very sufficiently.

The battery pack was an emergency item that I didn’t really use apart from day 2 at Courmayeur.

The water bladder was also an emergency item that I only used in day 2 and day 5.

My day to day itinerary

Day 1 – Les Houches to Refuge de la Balme via Col de Tricot (via the high route) 5:30am – 3pm, 26km


Les Houches to Bellevue (2 hours): I stayed in Rockypop the day before (after cheering for the last round of UTMB finishers). Left the hotel around 5:30am. I was hoping today to be an 8/9 hour day with lunch at Les Contamines.


My intention is to complete the whole TMB journey on feet, no shortcut whatsoever. I know people could take the cable car up to Bellevue but clearly this is not something I have in mind. The climb to Bellevue was fairly easy on dirt road.

Bellevue to Col de Tricot (2 hours): The variant to Col de Tricot was also ok – some steep climbs but nothing crazy. Took me about 2 hours. Still on schedule.


Col de Tricot to Refuge de Miage (1.5 hours). The going down bit kind of made me to reset my expectation. As I mentioned earlier, it has a lot of lossy rocks and it was a non-stop descend of 600m elevation loss. Although I can always have the refuge de miage in view, it seems I can never reach there. It took me 1.5 hours to get there and I was somewhat exhausted. As such, I decided to take a short break and had some blueberry pie and ice cream.


Refuge de Miage to Les Contamines (1.5 hours). The remaining journey to Les Contamines was ok – still some climbs and lossy rocks but much more manageable. Got there around 12:30pm – slightly slower than my goal but acceptable. Because I had an earlier break and I was not hungry, so I decided to push on without any stop (most restaurants are closed anyway).


Les Contamines to Refuge de la Balme (2.5 hours).The climb to Refuge de la Balme was somewhat tough – the terrain was ok but I was just exhausted (mentally and physically). It took me another 2 hours to finish the day (not including the flat road section in Les Contamines).


I had to say that I had a panic attack after day 1 – on paper this should be the easiest day but I didn’t find it easy. With day 2 (the hardest day) coming up. I seriously don’t know if I am still capable of completing the TMB.


Day 2 –Refuge de la Balme to Courmayeur (via Col des Fours) 4:00am – 6:30pm 35km


I didn’t bring my earplug which turns out to be a very stupid mistake. I thought I’m a deep sleeper so it was ok but NO IT IS FUCKING NOT. It was literally a snoring symphony at night and because I was still panicking about day 2, I realise I couldn’t sleep anymore around 3:30am so I decided to hit the road early. After some early breakfast (sourdough) and I started my day 2 around 4am.


Refuge de la Balme to Col des Fours (3 hours) The climb up to Col des Fours was surprisingly easy. With that being said, I did get lost once during the dark and wasted around 15min to get back on trail. The view at Col des Fours was somewhat disappointing though (weather was overcast). However, I took it not for the view, but to shorten the distance. I made it around 7am.


Col des Fours to La Ville des Glaciers (2 hours) From Col des Fours to La Ville des Glaciers was relatively easy – it was long but not to steep. I made it around 9am. With that being said, I was clearly behind track (5 hours over 11km). At this stage I was still worried about my schedule with another 20km to cover.


La Ville des Glaciers to Col de la Seigne (2 hours) The climb to Col de la Seigne was ridiculously hard (mentally and physically). From a terrain perspective, it is very easy, but I’d say at that point (also I couldn’t rest properly the day before) it was such a torture to make to the top, especially that it took me 7 hours to the half way point of the day.


Col de la Seigne to Refugio Elizabetta (1 hour) Once I made to the top, the rest of journey to Refugio was surprisingly easy – the descend was not steep, the trail was wide. I could even trail run most of it to make up for time. Now that I was back on track (it was 12pm and I only had 10km left), I took a much needed rest with some food to enjoy the view (people, if you can, book this refugio, it is literally the refugio with the best view).


Refugio Elizabetta to Refugio Combal (30min). I don’t know if my misconception or what, but the Italian section of TMB is much more easier than the French side. At this point I kind of picked up my confidence again and even did an extra loop at Lago del Miage. At this stage, I have made the decision that I want to press on to Courmayeur (instead of staying at Maison Vieille).

Refugio Combal to Maison Vieille (2.5 hours). This section is also very easy with magnificent views. As it was only 2pm when I left Refugio Combal, I was not rushing so that I could enjoy the views.


Maison Vieille to Courmayeur (2 hours). The descend was not that hard but it was pretty tough for me after 12 hours of hiking. I made to Courmayeur at a very slow speed… Later, turns out this decision to make it to Courmayeur was a smart move because I only paid 1 euro for the refuge deposit but if we don’t stay in the hotel it will be 130 euros wasted (the tunnel was closed and bus cancelled without any notice). As such, I enjoyed the room myself and had a big proper breakfast the next day (hot bread, salami, sausage and other meaty stuff I really want to eat after 2 days of intense hiking).


Day 3 Courmayeur to Refugio Bertone


Nothing much to say for today – wondered around Courmayeur in the morning and hiked up to Refugio Bertone.


Day 4 Refugio Bertone to Ferret via Promplo 5:30am to 4pm 24km


Just as I was building up my confidence level, a thunderstorm kind of demolished it. 10 hours of hike in non-stop rain was absolutely brutal. I really should have brought a pair of waterproof gloves or even some plastic bags to protect my hands.


Refugio Bertone to Refugio Walter Bonati (2.5 hours) This section was fairly easy so that I can keep my leisure pace. It was raining hard so I stopped for some coffee to warm me up.


Refugio Walter Bonatti to Refugio Elena (2 hours) This section was not hard either (although it was slippery particularly due to the rain). I decided to stop again to warm up with some coffee and pie.


Refugio Elena to Grand Col Ferret (1 hour) This was the hardest hour of the day – hard wind and rain to make me a suffering day. Again, I was really hoping for some weather protection item to protect my hands.


Grand Col Ferret to Ferret via Promplo (4 hours) Apart from slushy mud, this section is not hard. However, I made another stupid mistake by going to Ferret via Promplo (which I believe was the old TMB route?). It was too slippery and too steep that I almost fell a few times, plus there was not much to see. It extended the time by quite a while.


Day 5 Ferret to Relais d’Arpette (8am – 3pm 20km)


Nothing much to say for this day – easiest day of the TMB. Enjoyed the sun a lot after a hard day. The only day I had a “scheduled” breakfast in a mountain hut (it was a disappointing one though, just some bread and instant coffee).



Day 6 Relais d’Arpette to Auberge la Boerne via Fenetre d’Arpette and Les Grands (5:30am to 8pm, 23km)



My wife has been training for the TMB over the past year but it proved that it was not enough…


Relais d’Arpette to Fenetre d’Arpette (4 hours) It was clearly the toughest section of the entire TMB, in fact too tough for my wife. We were already 1.5 hours behind schedule at this point.


Fenetre d’Arpette to Chalet du Glacier (4 hours) The descend was not easier of course. Too many loose rocks. We were 3 hours behind schedule. With another 14km and 1300m elevation change to cover. I know that none of us would make it if we hike together. As such, my wife headed to Trient to catch public transport while I continued on.


Chalet du Glacier to Refuge du Col de Balme (3.5 hours). Turns out after Fenetre d’Arpette I was already very exhausted especially I was hiking at my wife’s speed and Les Grands had quite a few tricky sections (for me). It took me 3.5 hours to cover 7km which was probably a new low… The view was spectacular though.


Refuge du Col de Balme to Refuge La Boerne (3 hours). After Les Grands I was finally back on the main TMB track. It was fairly easy to Aiguillette des Posettes before the final 700m descends. Definitely the toughest day but with the best view (especially around Aiguillette des Posettes when it was the golden hour).


Day 7 – Refuge la Boerne to Les Houches via Lac Blanc (5:30am – 5:30pm 25km)


After such an exhausting day, I don’t know if I should still go via Lac Blanc or not. Then I thought fuck it, I don’t know I will have another opportunity of visiting Lac Blanc in the future so I’d just do it.


Refuge la Boerne to Lac Blanc (2 hours) Knowing it will be a hard day with a final 1500m descend to wrap it up, I thought I should start slow and steady. The climb to Lac Blanc was ok with mostly easy terrain (there are some ladders but nothing crazy). I was hoping to buy some food/water at Refuge du Lac Blanc but they said they don’t serve people until 9am so I thought I’ll just move on.


Lac Blanc to Flegere (1.5 hours) This is not hard although with some rocky downhills. I was hoping to get at least some water but the restaurant was closed. I was also shocked that there is no water refill point given this is a “touristy” section.


Flegere to Brevent (1 hour) I was running out of water and per Google maps the restaurant at Brevent is open, except it is NOT. I was seriously debating if I should walk to Le Brevent without water, then I decided to do it knowing it could be a possibly stupid decision.


Brevent to Le Brevent (2 hours) The climb to Le Brevent was ok with some interesting terrain. I’d say it is enjoyable if the weather is good. Unfortunately it was raining so the view was less than ideal.


Le Brevent to Les Houches (4 hours) This was way slower than I was hoping for. The section before Refuge de Bellachat was ok and flat-ish. Things got worse afterwards. Because of the rain, the rocks are very slippery and I had to struggle with most of my feet placement (especially after 170km and 6 days, my legs were very exhausted). Thankfully, knowing it is the final stretch, I had the mental strength to finish it.",4,1730683668.0,Ultralight,1,1.0,False

1gj2mcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gj2mcs/feel_like_giving_up_on_dating/,Feel like giving up on dating ,"This will be somewhat of a long story. Several months ago I (41 m) was at a function that invoked my church. I got talking to a guy about several things. After we had been talking for a while he asked if I was married. I answered that I was not and that I never had been. Not for lack of trying. He mentioned h might know someone, I  thought it was a joke. As I was leaving the event, his daughter came up to me and asked about doing dinner sometime. I said of course. I got her number and the next day I texted her. 

A few weeks later she reached out about doing dinner on Saturday November 2nd. I told her that was fine and this is when I found out it was not with the daughter but a friend of hers. Now I had been on a previous blind date and while it didn’t go anywhere it was a good time. 

I verified with the daughter on October 30th making sure that the dinner was still on. She verified that it was. On Friday November 1 I received a text that the woman I was supposed to meet was sick. (She is a teacher and caught something) so the dinner was canceled. She gave me her friend’s number and my number to her friend. 

Her friend sent me a text late last night after I had gone to bed. I responded this morning and we started talking about meeting up for coffee later this week. We arranged to meet this coming Friday. I asked her age and she responded that she was 30. I told her that I was 41. I did ask if she had any questions for me. About an hour after we had set up the date I got this message from her. “I don’t really have any questions. However, I wasn’t aware of our age difference.  I don’t want to lead you on and go on a date as I don’t see this turning  into a serious relationship due to this difference. I hope you can understand. Take care!” I replied that I understand and wish her all the best. 

Now I understand that the age difference can be a problem. It’s just frustrating and makes me more determined to just give up dating all together. The part that sucks is that I am tired of feeling lonely. Now I was not and do not plan to rush things, but like I said I am just frustrated and tired of trying. Just wanted to vent. 

Hope everyone had a good weekend. ",4,1730682780.0,dating,2,0.84,False
1gj2lkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gj2lkr/aio_for_thinking_my_friend_assaulted_me/,AIO for thinking my friend assaulted me?,"This happened a few months ago, but it’s been bothering me a lot.

I have a messy history with a guy that I’ll call Peter. We were coworkers and became very close friends that would hang out after work. He had a long-term girlfriend, so I didn’t consider him as an option, even though I found him attractive.

One night, we both got really drunk and he kissed me. I reciprocated for a few seconds before it hit me and I stopped him. He tried again multiple times, escalating faster and further each time, but I shut it down pretty quickly. I feel guilty for not kicking him out right away. The next day, I told him that I would tell his girlfriend if he didn’t. He spun a story about telling her and how she reacted, but I caught on two weeks later and messaged her. She didn’t know, so they broke up.

I was furious and avoided working with him for a while after that. I eventually got a long apology text in which he said he was going to therapy and expressed interest in being friends or at least working together again. I told him I was still mad, but I’d call him when I wasn’t anymore.

I called him about a month later and realized how much I had missed him. We were very close and could talk for hours. We got coffee and kept things very platonic and facetimed a few times after that. He was a bit flirty over the phone.

Onto the incident. I went to a karaoke bar with my friend and got very, very drunk. On a whim, I texted him, and he was there 10 minutes later. That’s about the last thing I remember.

I woke up naked in bed with him the next day with a club wristband on. I was hungover and sick, but he tried to initiate sex. I said no.

I called him that night to fish for information. I was pretty sure we had sex and I had no memory of using protection (something I would normally insist upon), so I asked if he pulled out. He said “yeah I did, both times.” I was shocked by that and told him that he did nothing wrong, but that I was definitely too drunk to be having sex.

I had been seeing someone for about a year, but he refused to commit to a relationship every time I asked. Still, he reacted very badly when I told him and he was furious with me. I was devastated and called friends and family to talk through it.

Everyone told me I had been assaulted. They said that if I was so drunk I had a multi-hour memory gap, I was too drunk to consent. My friend told me he only had one drink that night, and I know he hadn’t had any others because he came straight from work.

I called him to tell him we shouldn’t talk anymore and he was angry. He called me manipulative and said I knew exactly what I was doing when I sent that text and that it was fully consensual. I blocked him after hanging up.

Since then, I’ve heard mixed things. My friends say he raped me, and others say that being drunk is no excuse for my behavior and that drunk sex is normal. I get that people have drunk sex all the time, but I was at the point where I don’t remember at all and he was sober.

I always have to make sure my younger siblings get up, or else they'll sleep till noon even with their alarms and miss the school bus, and the same with my parents, who apparently have to rely on their 18 year old to make sure they get up on time.

I remember once that we had a family brunch scheduled for 11 with the grandparents, aunts and uncles and cousins. We ended up being late by more than an hour, all because everyone wanted to sleep in until a few minutes before we had to leave. I was already showered, dressed and ready. I had also tried waking them up, but they would just brush me off and go back to sleep.

That wasn't the first time either. We had family friends over to stay for a long weekend. My parents had planned to spend the whole weekend with them because they live in a different country and we didn't see them as often. My parents and siblings ended up sleeping in until almost 2 in the afternoon. I was up at 6, like usual, and ended up having to make breakfast for them, as well as making some coffee for them. They ended up only spending a few hours out of the whole weekend with them since they were asleep for most of it.

And one of the more frustrating times was when we went to a ski resort for a vacation. The hotel we were staying at only provided free breakfast between 6-10 am, so I went down to eat since my family hadn't woken up yet and I was hungry. I ate, came back up, and when the rest of my family had woken, free breakfast was already over. They had asked me why I hadn't brought any breakfast up to them, but I didn't know that it was my responsibility. 

I'm absolutely sick of it, and I've talked to them about it MULTIPLE TIMES!! Just last month, I decided to put my foot down and just decided to not bother waking them up or waiting for them anymore. If we had an early event to be at, I would just take my car and leave without them. My parents got really mad at me, saying that I was being unreasonable since it's not a ""big deal"".

I'm so frustrated with them. They also don't go to sleep late either, at most they stay up till 11, but not much longer past that. I just don't get how people can be like this.

Short Bible Study with me about Philippians 2:3

Introduction
------------

This study will guide you through understanding this Scripture, showing you practical ways to live it out, and helping you to reflect deeply on its message. Let’s embark on this learning adventure together, as we uncover the jewels hidden in God’s Word.

Scripture is not just ancient text but a living, breathing guidebook for life today. Engaging with it should inspire joy, curiosity, and a hunger for more. As you explore Philippians 2:3 with us, you’ll discover the richness of humble service and how it can enhance every aspect of your life. So, prepare to be encouraged and inspired as we delve into this transformative passage. Together, we’ll explore ways to bring greater meaning to our lives and relationships.

Bible Verse
-----------

Philippians 2:3 (NIV): “Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves.”

Meaning
-------

At the heart of Philippians 2:3 lies a profound call to humility. Paul writes to the Philippians from prison, urging them to adopt the same mindset as Christ Jesus. But what does this look like in real life? At its core, this verse challenges the defaults of human nature—selfish ambition and vain conceit. It tells us to put aside our ego and consider others with love and respect.

The backdrop of this verse is the pagan culture of Philippi, which was steeped in pride and competition. Paul’s message was counter-cultural then, just as it is now. True humility isn’t about thinking less of ourselves but thinking more of others and treating them with the dignity and honor they deserve.

This verse is part of a larger narrative encouraging unity through humility. By looking at others beyond our pride or ambition, we create a community that reflects love and grace. This radical shift in perspective can transform workplaces, families, and communities. Ultimately, by valuing others above ourselves, we reflect the heart of Christ, showing the world a different—and more beautiful—way to live.

Actions to Take
---------------

1. **Practice Active Listening**: Take time this week to listen to someone without interrupting. Pay full attention, and seek to understand their perspective.
2. **Volunteer Your Time**: Choose a local charity or community project where you can offer your skills or help out without seeking anything in return.
3. **Celebrate Others**: Make a conscious effort to acknowledge the achievements of others. Send a note of congratulation or commendation.
4. **Gratitude Journal**: Begin journaling daily, noting down at least three things you are thankful for about others in your life.
5. **Selfless Acts**: Perform one act each day that is selfless and reflects the heart of Christ, whether it’s making coffee for a colleague or running an errand for someone in need.

Journal Prompts
---------------

1. Reflect on a time when you valued someone else’s needs above your own. How did it impact your relationship with them?
2. In what ways do you struggle with selfish ambition or conceit? How can you work to overcome these tendencies?
3. Think about the people in your life you often overlook. What steps can you take to better appreciate and value them?
4. How does humility strengthen community and relationships? Write about a situation where you witnessed this firsthand.
5. Write about times when humility opened doors to new opportunities or growth in your life.

Prayer
------

Heavenly Father, thank You for the profound wisdom found in Your Word. Help me to set aside selfish ambition and to see others through the eyes of humility and love. Teach me to value those around me and to serve them with a willing heart. Mold my character to reflect Christ’s example of love and selflessness. Strengthen my resolve to act humbly and joyfully in all situations. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

STOP. THIS. CHILDISH. BEHAVIOR. IT KILLS SMALL BUSINESSES. 

There's two reasons for it: either you're too broke to tip, or you have some weird ideal about ""businesses should just be simply paying their workers better.""

If you're too broke to tip, you're too broke to go out. Period. I don't expect you to tip more than 15% for businesses like coffee shops and bakeries, but if you're dining in and receiving full service, you should really do your best to leave 20% (unless your food and server are absolute dogwater, in which case, leave 10% or less). 

If you have some weird ideal about businesses paying their workers better, you're ignorant and don't understand how small businesses work. Small business owners make very little, especially off food. The max they can afford to pay their workers usually tops out around $18/hr, with some minor exceptions being made for managers and assistant managers. Please tip your food service workers, that's how they make their money. Everyone's (usually) doing their best, and not tipping only hurts the worker you're staring in the face as you hit ""no tip.""

Please take your weird ideals elsewhere, as there's a trickledown that happens that ends up ultimately doing more harm then good.",0,1730682085.0,Portland,53,0.21,False

When I started, I went keto, and saw some good success with weight loss specifically.

I’m 5’ 9” tall, 55 years old and much to sedentary.

I started out at 203 lbs and 28% body fat on Jan 25^(th), 2020.  I dropped down to 162 lbs and 18.7% body fat on June 18, 2020.  I got a lot less strict and by October 19^(th), I’d gone back up to 187 lbs and 24.4%.  By March 2021, I was back down to 166 lbs and 19.6% BF.  Did some traveling and the weight climbed back up to 185 lbs in November 2021.  I bounced around in this range for the next couple years, mostly because I let the carb/sweet addiction keep grabbing me and pulling me into the upper range of this until July of this year.

Since July, I’ve been fully carnivore, other than some chicharrónes from time to time.  I’ve stayed right around 180 lbs until September 1^(st), when I went strict carnivore, eating only eggs, ground beef and salmon.  For the last 63 days, my standard eating has been 6 eggs, scrambled in either ghee or grass-fed butter for lunch, around noon every day, then three half pound 85/15 100% grass-fed beef patties (from Aldi) and a 6 oz salmon filet every evening, usually around 5pm.  I will occasionally have 4 or 5 half-pound patties, sometimes without the salmon.  I average about 2500 calories a day.

I’m not particularly active, but I do walk for 30-60 minutes a couple days a week, but I’m mostly working at my desk all day.  I’ve had nothing other than butter, eggs, beef and salmon for the last 63 days.  I put LOTS of salt on everything I eat.  I’ve always put ‘too much salt’ on my food, but since going mostly carnivore years ago, I’ve salted to taste, and that is a LOT of salt.  I stopped drinking coffee about a year ago and only drink water.

I don’t stop eating because I’m full, but that’s mostly because I don’t yet trust my hunger signals.  I feel particularly stuffed AFTER I finish dinner, but normally I’m not stuffed, nor am I hungry throughout the day.

The results of this are that on 9/1, I weighed 181.4 lbs and had 23.6% BF and this morning I weighed 179.4 lbs with 23.25 BF.  I fluctuate between 178 and 182 and the Body Fat % is not changing either.

I feel generally well, and don’t have any big health issues, which is good, but my body composition isn’t really improving at all.  My measurement around my stomach, at my belly button is 36”, sometimes slightly more.  I sometimes get really drowsy after dinner, and I have the occasional loose stool, but I generally have solid poop a couple times a week.

I’m planning to just keep on doing this in the hopes that my weight and BF will eventually start heading back down, but after 2 months of really strict carnivore, I’m feeling a bit dejected.  When I was losing the weight, and got down to 161 lbs, I was eating less than I do now.  I was eating one meal a day for much of that time, and I could go back to that, but I’ve seen/heard that it’s not ideal, and eating a small lunch and large dinner has been working as far as satiety/satisfaction goes.  I was also taking Apple Cider Vinegar with a large glass of water twice a day back in the thinner days, and have not been doing that for over a year.

Much of what I’m seeing is that I may not be eating enough, but I’m eating at least 2 lbs of meat and eggs every day and \~2500 calories, so I’m not sure if eating more is a great idea.

Sorry for the long post with maybe too much information, but I figured if I share everything I think could be relevant, it would lead to better suggestions from you all.

Hisakak walked down the street with what was, to his people, a big smile on his face. Living on a human world wasn’t easy for the reptilian alien, but he managed to make things work out pretty well. One of those things that helped was meeting a fellow alien on this world of small pink soft creatures. An arachnoid who, like Hisaka, found herself at home on this world that was vastly different from either of their home worlds.

Riliah was sipping her coffee when she noticed Hisakak coming and couldn’t help but give her own people’s version of a smile. “Looks like someone is in a good mood. I haven’t seen you in two weeks. Where have you been.”

Hisakak sat down, ordering his usual, an expresso with Sharakin. He found the plant from his home world gave this expresso a naturally sweet flavor compared to human sugar. Hisakak let his friend stew in anticipation for a little before answering, “Well, you know that I have been dating Shanna for a while now and well. While on a trip, We decided to elope. In Human culture, that is where a couple gets married.”

Riliah interrupted, “I know what elope means, and I’m quite familiar with human marriage customs. As you know, I’m already married to one. How could you not tell me until now?” The arachnoid looked visibly upset, and anyone who wasn’t familiar with their body language could easily have assumed that she was about to bite Hisakak’s head off, and she was about to, metaphorically.

Hisakak “Well, I would have but. I was so caught up in... things... that time got away from us.” He took a sip of his drink with a smirk. Riliah's twelve eyes went wide before a few narrowed in confusion. Her large chitin body moved as if unsure how to proceed, and her chelicerae kept opening and closing as she was about to speak. “What is it?” Hisakak said to draw the words out of his arachnid friend.

Finally, the words got her to speak what she was struggling with “I thought you were against having young.” The statement made Hisakak spit his drink out and start choking causing quite a disturbance as he fought to gain his composure. The statement wasn’t one he was expecting, and was finally about to get out a word out “What?”

“Well, I’m assuming by busy and lost track of time you and Shan… your wife were… doing the deed.” Getting a nod from the now blushing reptilian, “I guess you were just using protection then.”

Hisakak’s eyes went wide. “Why would I need protection? Shanna couldn’t hurt me, and we were in a very safe resort. I haven’t felt in danger since I came to this world. One of the reasons I decided to leave my people’s empire was that I was tired of all the hostility and fighting. Also, I haven't let my wife know about my feelings towards young as we don't have to worry about such things.” The naive and innocent thought brought some happiness to Riliah, as her friend reminded her of her husband when they first were dating.

“Oh, my dear Hisakak, don’t you know. Humans breed with anything.” She took another sip of her coffee as Hisakak looked at her confused with a straight face and just slowly nodded in agreement, but clearly not understanding her statement, “I’m not saying they attempt to… I’m saying they… do.”

Hisakak took a moment to process what was just said, and his eyes widened. “You can’t be serious. I mean, I’m a reptilian, and she is a mammal. Two comple.” He was interrupted by a shake of Riliah's head, saying he was wrong. “I mean, you and Frank adopted your.” And again, was interrupted by a shake of Riliah’s head. “You mean your kids are.” Getting a nod.

Riliah put her drink down slowly and took Hisakak’s hand. “I didn’t think it was possible at first either, but I’ve come to find that humans are… more capable than I thought at first. I mean, it wasn’t the first time, but when it did happen, I did a little research, and, well, I shouldn’t have been as surprised as I was.”

The reptilian jaw moved up and down without words coming out, almost looking like he was a speaking animatronic more than a living, breathing being. “That is just… I mean… How?”

Riliah shrugged with all three of her legs. For her people, one set shrugging meant they didn’t know but had an idea, two shrugging meant they didn’t know, didn’t have an idea, but might know someone who does, and all three meant she didn’t think anything in this universe had a clue about it “You know the Arvarians, the so-called angle race.”

Hisakak nods, “Yes, they are human-looking, with feathery wings and patches of scales on their lim… no… they couldn’t… there are billions of them.”

Riliah nods. “Yes, apparently, their whole race was born out of a world that humans and Calvarians settled at the same time. Sure, there was fighting at first, but after a few centuries of peace, well… a few centuries later and.” She made a poof motion that humans often did with her forelegs. Riliah sat there, if humans could breed with an avian race “Surel.” He was cut off again with a hand.

“You know the silicone base race, the Zurmondans.” Hisakak nods. “Well, apparently, a scientist who was working with one of them grew close and, both being researchers, wanted to find out if coupling was even possible. They said nine months after finding an enjoyable method for both.”

Riliah laughs, “Oh, now you’re pulling my leg.” This is a human phrase that he learned until Riliah pulled up articles and a research paper on the subject on her datapad to show him, “That isn’t… the Zurmondans don’t even have reproductive parts; they just… H.” While he was bewildered, Riliah decided to add some more confusion.

“I’m also sure you’re aware of the Hubrians. The cybernetic race of humans.” Hisakak’s face made it clear he wasn’t ready for it. “Apparently, a human and a Dwarcylic had developed a connection, and when he taught the Dwarcylic about human reproduction, a bit of his DNA got inside the mechanical body, and the nanites inside started to replicate it based on the DNA information inside his."" Riliah coughed a little. ""Anyway, adding some cybernetics components when there was… incomplete data. I’m not entirely sure how it works myself, but suffice it to say their example started a craze with humans finding partners among the mechanical race that led to the birth of another entirely new species… I believe that brought it up to thirty hybrid species?” taking a sip of her drink as she contemplated the numbers.

There was silence for a while before Hisakak was able to look up from the datapad. He saw a look that sent a chill down his spine. An arachnid smirk that was saved for times when Riliah was sure she would be laughing about something for weeks. Slowly, Riliah turned in the direction Rhiliah was looking in, but what Hisakak saw put a smile on his face. Shanna was approaching them. Her smile brought warmth to his heart, though she seemed to be pointing to something small in her hand as she approached, something that looked like a small stick. Then his smile quickly faded as he heard from behind him, “Don’t worry, Frank and I saved some of the essentials from before our little ones could take care of themselves.”",76,1730681544.0,HFY,18,0.97,False

I saw a post here recently that was so confusing and elusive and artistic it made me really wanna say “what is up?” (I didn’t) and thought to myself “maybe I can do that” and quickly realized, I absolutely cannot, because, me, myself,  I am boring and not insightful. 

I’m recently 31. I have a career (I guess it’s a career). I have healthy (and unhealthy) habits. Who doesn’t. And I live for nights that never end, even though I typically hit the sheets at 8:30pm. I’m an early riser trying to form a morning routine. And I’ve never met a stranger. I believe heaven is a ton of pews of everyone and everything you’ve ever loved and the buffet there starts at 6. Heads up - not religious this is just what I’ve thought since I was a kid and stick to it. 

I love dive bars and cheap Budweiser. I like the fancy stuff too, but I just feel at home next to a dude in a 3 patch vest or a lady with a few missing teeth and a cigarette hanging out of her mouth. I’m creative enough to make gifts, but not creative enough to go past that. I love sports to give me something to talk about and be extremely sad or happy over. Music is my…music is just about the biggest driving force in why I use all my PTO every year. 200+ concerts and counting (RHCP has been my favorite one before you ask). I workout out despite being a bigger girl - ask me about my leg press goal for my 31st year. Big gym girly. Motivated on occasion, but it’s often fleeting.

I don’t like a people hater, video games or anime. Life’s too short to be negative about everything, something in life has to be good. I see how that’s a hypocritical statement after saying I don’t like something. But those things are just not for me.

Every morning, as the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled my kitchen, the thought of tackling another long day tugged at me. I’d tried countless supplements that promised energy boosts and weight management, only to be let down by ineffective or overly stimulating results. Then, I stumbled upon something that seemed intriguing yet simple: a tasteless powder designed to seamlessly blend into my morning ritual. This was the game changer I didn’t know I needed.

Adding this product was as simple as tearing open a packet and stirring it into my coffee. No adjustments to the flavor, no overpowering bitterness — just the same comforting cup I knew, with an invisible yet powerful boost. Within days, subtle changes emerged. Mornings felt lighter; that sluggish feeling was replaced by a steady stream of alertness and vitality. My metabolism seemed to catch up with my lifestyle, a noticeable shift from previous attempts where results were sluggish, at best.

The secret, I learned, was in the synergistic blend of ingredients crafted to amplify metabolic function naturally. Green tea extract, known for its antioxidants and metabolism-enhancing catechins, played a lead role. L-carnitine and chromium worked behind the scenes to regulate energy and keep blood sugar levels in check. It wasn’t just about burning calories; it was about maintaining a balance that kept my body in sync with my goals.

By the end of the first month, the results spoke louder than any claim could. Clothes fit better, workouts felt more rewarding, and a mental clarity I hadn’t experienced in years settled in. Cravings that once derailed my progress were subdued. This wasn’t some magic pill that replaced hard work — it complemented my existing habits, making them more effective.

What stood out was the product’s commitment to quality: free from fillers, artificial additives, and harmful chemicals. Knowing it was manufactured in a facility that met high safety standards reassured me I was on the right path. The journey wasn’t without its skeptics. “Is it really helping, or is this a placebo?” someone asked me. The difference, though, was tangible enough that no explanation was needed. The morning routine that once felt like a kickstart became an all-day source of sustained energy.

My experience isn’t unique; it echoes the stories of many who’ve made similar changes. The lesson? Simple additions can catalyze major transformations. When I reflect on this journey, it’s clear that sometimes, the most subtle interventions hold the most profound impact.

Reflecting on my journey with this transformative addition to my mornings, it's important to paint an honest picture by diving into its pros and cons. After all, real success stories aren’t just about what went right; they’re about understanding the full experience.

**Pros:**

1. **Seamless Integration into Daily Routine**: One of the biggest advantages was how effortlessly it fit into my life. Unlike many weight management supplements that require significant lifestyle shifts, this product only needed to be mixed with my morning coffee. There were no extra steps, no new flavors to get used to — just simplicity.
2. **Natural Ingredients**: The formula boasts a strong profile of scientifically backed components. Green tea extract, chlorogenic acid from green coffee beans, and L-carnitine are known for boosting metabolism and energy levels in a natural way. This gave me peace of mind, knowing I wasn't relying on synthetic chemicals.
3. **Enhanced Energy and Mental Clarity**: The impact on my daily energy was undeniable. Instead of the jittery highs and lows typical of caffeine overloads, I experienced consistent energy. This steadiness extended to mental sharpness, which helped me stay productive and focused throughout the day.
4. **No Artificial Additives**: The supplement prides itself on being non-GMO, vegetarian, and free from artificial fillers and colors. This aligned well with my preference for clean, health-focused products.
5. **Appetite Control**: Over time, I noticed a reduction in cravings. The product seemed to curb my usual mid-morning snack urges, making it easier to stick to balanced meals and avoid unnecessary snacking.

**Cons:**

1. **Price Point**: While the results spoke for themselves, the cost could be seen as a hurdle. High-quality supplements often come with a premium, and this one is no exception. Budget-conscious users might find it challenging to sustain long-term use without considering the expense.
2. **Consistency Required for Results**: Unlike quick fixes, this product requires consistent use for full benefits. Some people might find it difficult to maintain daily usage, especially if they're not habitual coffee drinkers.
3. **Not a Standalone Solution**: It’s important to highlight that while it boosts metabolism and energy, it isn’t a miracle solution. Results were best when paired with mindful eating and regular physical activity. It supports healthy habits rather than replaces them.
4. **Potential Sensitivity to Ingredients**: Although it contains natural substances, those sensitive to caffeine or other stimulants should proceed with caution. While it didn’t cause jitters for me, people with low tolerance could experience different effects.
5. **Availability Restrictions**: Depending on location, there might be limited access or higher shipping costs. While the supplement is widely available online, certain regions may face longer delivery times or higher fees.

Reflecting on both sides, the pros outweighed the cons for me personally, especially considering how it transformed my mornings into productive, energetic starts. The journey wasn't about finding a magic pill, but rather a supportive boost that worked harmoniously with my existing lifestyle.

1gj25ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gj25ty/how_do_i_29m_get_over_my_insecurity_about_my/,How do I (29M) get over my insecurity about my girlfriend's (26F) large number of male friends?,"Me (29M) and my girlfriend (26F) began dating six months ago. She is an extremely social person, which is a quality I really love about her, because I know that no matter who I bring her around or where, she makes it a good time. She also has an amazing friend group that I've been welcomed into, and I really appreciate that she has built such good friendships around the world.

However, one thing that has been a recent insecurity of mine and has surfaced into arguments occasionally, is the large amount of guy friends she has. I know that a lot of this has to do with my own insecurities, but I'm having such a hard time just getting over it. She has about 8 really close guy friends, and probably about 12-20 acquaintance guy friends around the world that she still regularly keeps in touch with. I'd say about 90% of them seem extremely kind hearted, genuine, and even on occasion we will just talk and catch up 1:1.

I don't think it's that she has guy friends that she catches up with that bother me, it's that she will regularly go do 1:1 things with her local guy friends and has tossed out the idea of going and visiting her friends internationally, most of which are men. For example, she has one guy friend who she will occasionally go to the gym with and catch up with, she has another guy friend she runs with occasionally, another she will go get coffee with and catch up with. Sometimes she has a friends movie night and it will be a mix of her girl and guy friends, but my problem is that I know some of these guys have liked her at one time or another. Also, she talks about going on international trips with her sister, and how she loves staying in hostels because then she get's to meet and explore with all sorts of cool people she meets in the hostels. Which, for her, typically means a group of guys and girls she will meet at hostel's and then they will all go explore the area, do activities, and go to bars/clubs and dance and stuff.

She is very transparent about her messages between her guy friends, is not like weirdly secretive or concealing about anything, and is very good with some boundaries like not talking about sexual stuff or about issues in our relationship, etc., which I appreciate tremendously.

I think the problem I'm having is that in all of my previous longterm relationships, and out of all the women in my life that I've known thus far, they will have guy friends, but it's not as personal as this. It's more like, a friend from high school that comes around for group events, or our mutual guy friends that hung out with us together, whereas this is more her building independent relationships with these men. Given, she's never weird about bringing me around them, and vice versa, and often, I have really good friendships with these guys as well and they definitely do add a fun aspect to life.

I'm truly not worried about her sleeping with anyone else, or even so much as kissing someone else. But, I think for me, it's like, why make it such a point to create these friendships? Like, we can travel the world together, we have an enormous friend group globally, and we are in a good spot. Why do we need to continue pulling more strange men into her life? To me, it just leaves the door open for things to cross a line and for things like emotional cheating to occur. To me, and I know this is a generalization, 99.9% of men are opportunists and my girlfriend is stunning with an amazing personality, they'd be crazy NOT to initially see this girl and be like, ""I could see myself with her"", whether that is dating, or hooking up, or whatever. And though, I know this isn't her intention, it sometimes just feels like I have all these men just looming and waiting for the opportunity when things are bad or I disappear to try to take it a step further. Her reasoning is that, those things are two-ways, and if she isn't looking for, or interested in anything like that with them, then why does it matter? Also, how can we know what each and every guy's intentions are when she meets them, and why is she responsible for deciphering that? But that's why I say, why bother to curate these 1:1 relationships with them and even pursue it in the first place? Like, in no way shape or form do I seek out women to have close emotional friendships with, because... why? She regularly says things like, ""I would love for you to have a woman that was interested in X hobbie that I may not be interested in to do with you."" and to me, that is just something I wouldn't do, because... why?

I'm struggling because I've never had to face this before. In all my last relationships, this wasn't even a thing. They had a majority of girlfriends with the occasional guy friend, as mentioned above. Additionally, with some of these guys, like her college friends from when she was single, some of them have done like streaking as a cross country team multiple times, or have gone skinny dipping in large groups together, etc. and it just feels so awkward when I'm hanging out with a group of her friends knowing like 3 of the guys there have seen my girlfriend completely naked on multiple occasions. Given, once again, most of these guys are in relationships of their own, but it's still weird. One of them she had a crush on years ago and they shared a kiss, nothing more, and they're both in relationships now, but still, it's just really uncomfortable.

I also want to add that she has never been withholding about like holding my hand, or kissing me, or posting pictures of us together, and making it known that we are together. She talks about me all the time, she loves me a ton and I love her a ton. I truly don't have any worries about her doing anything sketchy, it's mostly just them and what their intentions are. Especially random dudes at hostels we don't know anything about and are just trusting that she won't make a mistake that puts her in danger.

We have set some very clear boundaries that we both agreed to, like:

\- Keeping it strictly platonic and not discussing things that could leave doors open for emotional cheating, like relationship issues, insecurities, talking about like sexual things or her body, etc.

\- Being transparent and keeping me updated so I'm not just caught off guard about what's going on.

\- Setting clear boundaries if someone does try to cross a line, like ending one of those friendships if that person doesn't respect the boundaries above or is shady/weird.

\- Unless it's a really really close friend that has history there, not doing 1:1 things with guys that feel like dates.

\- etc.

But despite everything above, there is still just this fear looming in the back of my head and this insecurity I can't seem to get rid of, and it's eating me alive and going to cause resentment that shouldn't be in our relationship.

She has also made it clear that to her, gender doesn't define friendships, and that just suddenly not being friends with men is not something she is willing to give up for any relationship, which, I do respect, and I definitely don't want her to give up something she deeply values, especially when she is good with boundaries and the things listed above.

Any advice is appreciated.

  
Edit:

For me, a happy medium would be to cultivate and create male/female friendships together so that they are OUR friends, and not just her guy friends I'm getting introduced to and vice versa. That way we do stuff together, and, if the opportunity arises down the road where say we meet a guy named 'Jeff' that wants to go get coffee or go to a concert with us or whatever, and I can't for some reason, then being like, ""You should totally go with Jeff even though I can't make it!"" Rather than it being like, ""Hey, tomorrow I'm going to hang out 1:1 with this guy friend of mine named Jeff that you've never met.""

Edit 2:

One of the hypotheticals that we have discussed that also kind of gets to me, is whether or not, if the opportunity arose, if I'd be comfortable with her swimming in like a shirt and her underwear if she had no other swimsuit. This arose because one of my boundaries is like, keeping our ""genitals"" for lack of a better term to ourselves and our relationship, and she agreed and said that's totally fine. Basically, I just wanted to make sure my girlfriend wasn't going to be streaking or skinny dipping with random strangers still lol... However, one of the things she brought up, was, hypothetically speaking, if she was out with a group of friends, and the opportunity to jump in a river arose, but she didn't have a bathing suit, she would still want to swim and not miss out on a life experience because someone might sexualize the way she looks in underwear and a top. At first, I was like, this is insane... just don't swim then? However, I came around, and I was like, ok, yeah, I could see that, and I wouldn't want you to miss out on that because honestly some of her underwear or less sexy than her bathing suits anyways, and like, at the end of the day, a body is just a body, and it would be unfair of me to expect that. But, it's these hypotheticals that get in my head and fester, because I'm like creating this huge story in my head where she meets a group of handsome guys in some country, and then by the end of the night they're all swimming, some naked, her in her panties and top, and it just feels so bloody uncomfortable to me. And that's why, once again, I'm like, as a couple, and in all of my previous relationships its been like this, like, why wouldn't we just be together in this circumstance anyways? Why does everything have to be so independent? Like, one time, a huge group of us were hiking Mt. Whitney in California, and there is a beautiful lake up there, but none of us had swimsuits, so, the girls were in their bra's and underwear and us guys were in our boxers. Didn't bother me or phase me at all, but alone, it just feels different. Especially considering that every single pair of underwear she owns are mesh G-strings that are see through, and of the two bra's she owns and very rarely wears, they are both completely see through... However, she just said in that case she would just wear her t-shirt, but still, I'm just like, why are you even in these situations alone in the first place with random dudes and I'm not there?

**TL;DR:** OP (29M) loves his girlfriend (26F) for her social nature and strong global friendships, but struggles with insecurity over the many close male friends she has and her independent 1:1 interactions with them. Despite trust in her faithfulness and her adherence to clear boundaries they’ve set, OP finds it difficult to shake the fear of potential emotional cheating and feels uncomfortable with certain aspects of her past and friendships. He respects her view that gender shouldn’t limit friendships, but is unsure how to handle his own insecurities without creating resentment in the relationship.
