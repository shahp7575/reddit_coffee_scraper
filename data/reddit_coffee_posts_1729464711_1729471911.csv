Nmother has a physical disability and I've been her carer for the last four years. 

For context, she doesn't need to level of care I was expected to provide. Mobility is a struggle, but not impossible. She walks with an aid (walking stick). She doesn't need personal care assistance. It's really just the big stuff she actually needs help with (lawns, floor cleaning, bedding cleaning and changing). 
She would abuse me if I didn't make her every meal, 5+ coffees a day, all her shopping, go to her GP appointments FOR her, all the household cleaning, etc. 

I had enough and I moved out (after getting her on an appropriate care package). 
I take her to physio once a week, and take her to any big appointments that it it were me I would want emotional support (medical botox injections, etc). It's more than she deserves honestly. 
I don't want to do her menial household tasks anymore, and I don't want to do things that someone that's getting paid can do instead. 
Her carers generally don't have much to do during their shifts too because she's low needs. 

When she asks me to do something that a carer can do, I say no. 
I am so proud of myself but it comes with so much guilt. 
I like helping people. I don't really say no to people. 
I know she has a disability and it's in my nature to want to try and make it as easy as possible for her but I can't give her an in to abuse me anymore. 

Today she called me asking me to go to the chemist and get a (non vital) medication for her. She said she's out of the drug today. 
I told her why didn't she tell me before she was out. 
She said she thought she had some spare. 
I told her I would do it but she has to wait until I have the time.
She got upset and hung up on me.
This is the first time she's talked to me since last week when she asked me to come over on the weekend (reserved for my partner who works weekdays. Not negotiating.).
I said no. 
She pushed me and I said she has carers who can do it. 
She said she doesn't want the carers to do it, so I asked her if she considers my time less important than theirs, if she's happy for me to spend time doing it, but not for the carers to do it.

Dear , 
I am writing to you seeking representation for SECRETS OF THE WHITE PELICAN, a 70,000-word mystery suspense novel. 

JJ has a knack for reading people and solving murder mystery books before the big reveals. Two talents that keep her entertained throughout the day, since her wealthy controlling husband won‚Äôt let her use her hospitality degree. Now, they might help her survive her next getaway.

When JJ‚Äôs husband, Pierce, cheats with a coworker, she seizes the opportunity and blackmails him to buy her a 10-room boutique hotel. She knows he can afford it. JJ enlists the help of her 6 closest friends to evaluate The White Pelican Hotel located on a remote barrier island.

Unfortunately, a hurricane veers off path and heads straight towards them. When the island is evacuated, JJ and her group decide to hunker down in the hotel for a typical Florida hurricane party. As the storm rages, it cuts them off from the mainland. Then one of the friends is found murdered on the beach and another goes missing. Those left alive must band together until they are rescued. Once off the island they agree they can't tell the real story‚Äîso they lie. 

The friends are drawn back to the island after the discovery of a skeleton on the hotel property. The remains are identified, and the death is ruled due to natural causes. But JJ is certain the death involves foul play. She plans on doing a little sleuthing to uncover what really happened and determine if one of the friends didn‚Äôt stick to the lie. 

SECRETS OF THE WHITE PELICAN will appeal to fans of the locked room mystery, One By One by Ruth Ware. Also, for audiences that were captivated by the twists and turns of The Hunting Party by Lucy Foley. 

I currently live on Sanibel Island with my family. I have a Doctorate of Pharmacy from Nova Southeastern University, which helps me write about unfortunate drug interactions.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,


************First 300 ****

Chapter 1



JJ imagined herself as the owner of a charming beachside resort, an impossible dream since her husband controlled their finances. She swirled her dark coffee and her mind drifted to the crystal clear waters and white sand beaches. In this fantasy her husband was nowhere in sight. To make it happen, she needed a killer strategy.

Across the bistro table, Michelle sipped her frothy latte, unaware of JJ‚Äôs desires. She wondered if her best friend would help her or think she was crazy for wanting to run a hotel.


Her lips parted as she gathered her thoughts. She hoped Michelle would help her brainstorm a plan. Her foot bounced under the table, she glanced around the crowded cafe and frowned at the loud chatter and clinking of dishes.


Before she spoke, her phone buzzed and illuminated in her pocket.

JJ pulled the device out and scanned the screen.


A message from her husband: ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt make it tonight. Sorry. Business trip to Barbados got moved up.‚Äù


She found herself unable to type anything back. 

‚ÄúUnbelievable.‚Äù She plopped her cell face down on the table and took a deep breath to calm her nerves.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Michelle asked.


JJ slipped her cell back into her pocket with shaky hands. ‚ÄúNothing new, same story.  Just got stood up for the gala tonight.‚Äù Her lips turned down. She breathed out her nostrils and shook her head.


Michelle raised an eyebrow but didn‚Äôt press further.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Pierce,‚Äù JJ took a sip of her coffee to soothe her dry throat. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs leaving tonight for a business trip to Barbados.‚Äù


Michelle rolled her eyes.


 ‚ÄúAnd that means with Maria.‚Äù JJ said.


JJ avoided Michelle‚Äôs gaze. She envisioned Pierce and Maria, reclined on a pristine beach with cocktails in hand. Her stomach churned and bile rose in the back of her throat.",1,1729471754.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

I walked past to suss her out, composed myself one last time to quiet the urge to just run and looped back to greet her with a clumsy hug. 

She is pretty, albeit her Tinder pictures weren‚Äôt that recent, a little taller than me, well dressed but not dressed up.

You don‚Äôt get to my age without a girlfriend without feeling pretty broken, but one thing that I know and trust in myself is my perception. And it told me immediately and clearly that she wasn‚Äôt attracted. Of course, this wasn‚Äôt unexpected. I am no prize. That said, results from Tinder suggest my personality is more the issue here.

I‚Äôm pleased she accepts this as a legitimate date and gives me the time of day, catastrophising beforehand I imagine her utterly weirded out and sliding off to ask for Angela.

I labour in my head thinking up questions to keep things flowing but there‚Äôs the odd short silence that doesn‚Äôt hang too heavily.

We went to the same high school, but we never really clicked back then since he was one of the popular kids, and I definitely wasn't.

We matched on a dating app, and I immediately felt a connection. Once we swapped numbers, we ended up chatting for more than two hours! Meeting up became a dally thing-he would cook for me, take me out, and we had deep conversations. He made my entire week when he surprised me with a soda after my DoorDash driver messed up my order. (AKA the driver stole my coke) He didn't just bring one; he got a whole week's supply ""just in case."" He even showed up with lunch at my work, delivered coffee to my door in the morning, and we went grocery shopping together. He did all those things without me asking too, well not the grocery shopping, l was going and asking if he wanted to join. All those thoughtful things made me feel special, and I thought he might ask me to be his girlfriend soon.

But then I started overthinking everything and decided to ask how he felt about our relationship. His answer totally surprised me: he said he was just looking for something casual right now and thought he'd mentioned it earlier, but he really hadn't.
I felt heartbroken and confused. With all those romantic gestures, kind words, and us acting like a couple, I naturally assumed he felt the same. It felt like l'd been led on, which only made it hurt more, especially after we had such a strong connection.

My trainer took a swallow of his coffee. ‚ÄúFine, can‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you though.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve heard people talk about their scary legends, but nothing as ridiculous as what he told me.

‚ÄúHe is easy to spot. He wears a black three piece suit. Even our supervisors don‚Äôt dress that fancy. If you see him when you walk in, just go back out and you‚Äôll be fine. Go to a different bathroom if you need to.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt management or human resources warn us about him?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho would want to have a job here if they told everyone? We gotta make a living. Besides, not everyone believes it. I‚Äôve seen him though. It‚Äôs also not like he comes in here daily. Sometimes there‚Äôs been years worth of gaps of people spotting him.‚Äù 

I get it, it‚Äôs October. Halloween pranks are funny and all that jazz. 

‚ÄúOkay then.‚Äù 

My trainer seemed like a good guy. Perhaps he was a bit fuzzy in the head though. But this factory job was gonna help take care of my bills and help me get on a better path. 

I took another bite of my biscuit and took more notes on how to properly do the job. We were walking around the place as he gave me a brief tour when my morning coffee did what it does. I walked in the bathroom and only seen guys in their uniforms and favorite sport team hat. 

I go to my lunch break and tell my fianc√© what bogus story I was told. She laughed and said ‚Äúwhat about the shitting man?‚Äù I laughed ridiculously loud. 

After I was working in my area for a few hours, I told my trainer that I had to go slip by the bathroom. 

‚ÄúMake sure to keep an eye out for the peeing man!‚Äù He was being ridiculous.

I walked into our locker room which has three stalls and two urinals. They are on the opposite side of the room from the door. I looked at up and seen someone in a three piece suit at the urinal. The air felt colder than it did prior. Something in me just told me to stay still. 

Another new employee came walking through a different door to go to the next urinal. I called out. 

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

He turned back to me and gave me a strange look, ‚Äúhowdy.‚Äù 

He got to the urinal and unzipped himself. He turned to the man in the suit. ‚ÄúNice suit. Are you with corporate?‚Äù

The man turned his head to look at him and his skin was slightly blue. He reached up with his hand and shoved the employees head into the wall. He dropped down and his head was being beat into the urinal. He started choking him. I don‚Äôt see how this is possible, but he shoved him into the urinal hole. The man was wheezing for air. Blood and parts of the man‚Äôs insides were mushing out. He flushed but not everything went down 

The peeing man walked over to a stall and stepped in. He looked up at me with a smile that was from ear to ear. He waved his bony fingers at me before flushing and going down the drain. 

I sprinted out and told my trainer what happened, I was hyperventilating. He took me by the arm and walked me over to Human Resources where I shared my side of the story. 

The balding man smiled and told me that me and my trainer were getting a month paid off work. ‚ÄúWe appreciate if the public didn‚Äôt know about this. We‚Äôll also set you up with one of our counselors if you‚Äôd like.‚Äù

I‚Äôve been too shocked to tell my fianc√© what happened so far. I told her that the company laid off so many employees for the month. My trainer sent me a text that concerned me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go see that counselor, tell them you‚Äôre perfectly fine. That counselor is really a hypnotist. They chalked it up that the employee left early and they haven‚Äôt heard from him since. They fudged the time and his truck is gone. They closed down the bathroom, claiming it to be renovations. They are bringing in a priest disguised as a plumber to do a cleansing.

As I read the last two examples of the late legends of Harriet Tubman and Ghandi I found myself sitting in a stark contrast to the souls who followed their dharma to the end and the state that I currently find myself in. 
Not in a self deprecating way, but rather from a place of a child staring up at a towering set of parents. 
Bewildered by how these individuals could reach such spiritual heights of service and fervent pursuit of their dharmas, admiring their tenacity, faith and endurance. 

How could I, a 28 year old young man from Oklahoma reach the wholeness of dharma that these spiritual giants reached? 
Then I read further and Thomas Murton puts it all into perspective as he always does. 
He writes ‚Äúthe selfish anxiety to get the most out of everything, to be a sparkling success in our own eyes and in the eyes of other men, we can only get rid of this anxiety by being content to miss something in almost everything we do. We cannot master everything, taste everything, understand everything, drain every last experience of its dregs. But if we have the courage to let almost everything go, we will probably be able to retain the one thing necessary for us - whatever it may be. If we are too eager to have everything, we will almost certainly miss the one thing we need‚Äù. 

There it is. 
I do not have to become Beethoven or Ghandi. 
I don‚Äôt have to free slaves via the Underground Railroad. 
I do not have to fill the shoes of Jung, Ghandi or Jesus fucking Christ. 

I have to become the fullest expression of Samuel Palmer that I can possibly become. 
By lowering myself to zero, following the whispers of my daimon and sincerely perusing my dharma with fervor and honesty, I can then tend to the part of the garden that is within my reach. 
There is a small corner of the world that is mine to transform. 
Therefore I will do what I can to move towards transforming my little patch with service and love.

One thing I might add actually from the break up that remains to be one hiccup for me was his apathy.I remember crying and asking him question to better understand him, and he wouldn't look at me. He devoid of any emotion. That hurt me more than the actual words he said at the time. Since the break up, I've only allowed him to follow me on social media without me following him back, and we haven't texted since January. So when I saw his text, I was totally caught off guard.

Next day she told me she genuinely had feelings for him but she definitely didn't love him like me, she told me it got to this point after years of resentment, rejection.
our marriage really was at a horrible point and it was like we were staying together for the kids.
We've both been through a lot.
We had a heart to heart at Montana steakhouse, of all places. I didn't feel much better, but we decided to take a step back until we can get to see a therapist and have some deep dive into the roots of the problems we have. I agreed but told her she needs to dead him off ""like right now""
She couldn't do it. She said there was genuine feelings there and that she will process things over the next couple of days. But she said she wouldn't continue to talk to him and that she was committed to our relationship.
Unfortunately this wasn't over.
2 days later, she had a job interview. She woke up first thing in the morning, she typed 2 messages and sent them heard a woosh as they sent.. they didn't sound like the familiar iMessage) | wished her good luck and off she went. I had a gut feeling. I was seriously struggling at this point, going crazy in my head about what I saw in her phone. I went for a run to keep my mind occupied.
She messaged me on her ""lunch"" she didn't want to call as she was having lunch with her potential future co workers. Alarm bells started ringing more and more.. you couldn't just run for a quick phone call? I took a shower to keep myself busy. I had a shower thought, we share locations in our phone (something she implemented ironically)
Why the fuck is she at a hotel no where near a train station or any kind of lawyer building?

I threw on some clothes and drove at a speed that almost got me killed twice - seriously. Longest 20 minutes of my life.
I pull into the back of this hotel, there's our car.
My heart dropped. I blew up her phone so much that she replied back even though she was supposed to be in an ""essay for the job"" I told her I was in the lobby. She said I was crazy it's not what you think. Blah blah blah. ""You're ruining my interview, I just parked there and got on to the train"" I sent her location.. the penny dropped.
Another 10 minutes pass and she says she's coming down. I see her walk out of that elevator looking all beautiful as she ever did and I could have dropped to my knees and balled my eyes out. She storms to the car. ""It's not what you think""
I ripped into her in the car, called her names. How the fuck can you do that to me after l've left my whole life behind in another country. I'm here with you and the kids with no one but YOUR friends and YOUR family.
I told her it was over. But she explained that the hotel was booked from before and that and because there was feelings involved she owed him an explanation so they got coffee across the road and she told him that she wanted to work on our marriage. They hugged and he said it wasn't meant to be. She used the room as it was nor refundable. There's still some cracks in her si though I couldn't decide what to believe.

That evening we had to go to her aunts viewing who was like her mum. She asked me to be there
- I obliged.
The day after we had our mutual friends viewing after he committed suicide. We remained civil.
Actually before that I had a bit of an epiphany.. we lay next to each other whilst she took a nap, I was listening to some music, I had a silent cry, I could smell her and it was infatuating me, her silk scarf that she wore to protect her hair felt so smooth, I couldn't help but the overwhelming feeling of love came back. I didn't care about what happened I just wanted to make it right. I wanted to just end all of the resentment, work on myself, show her I could be everything she needed and more. This woman is my fucking life. I love her so much and holy fuck I hadn't realised just how fucking beautiful down to the last hair on her head she is.
This is my woman and I'm going to fight for her.
I told her so. Whispering sweet nothings in her ear as she awoke from her slumber. I told her I'm going to believe her.
She told me that's the energy she needed but was sceptical about my sudden shift in mood.
Anyway. That viewing happened, it was rough, then yesterday was her aunts funeral and the whole day was so tough.
I've been there for her the best I could be.
Today she left her phone open again and I went through it.. I find ""w"" in her contacts, it's a link to their telegram chat log. I couldn't enter it as it's password protected and she's changed her password now. The horrible feelings have flooded back. She says she deleted all the messages but refuses to show me.
I know you're all going to say I trusted her too quick. I get it. But fuck does she have me in a choke hold.
I don't know what I'm doing here but it's helped to type it all out as I don't really have any friends any more.
I guess what's bugging me the most is that it's somehow my fucking fault that this has all happened and I'm the one that's doing the grovelling to win her back. I don't even know if she wants me. She could be talking to this hunk of a man in her phone, abs n all, for all I know. It's tough, i feel unloved and alone.
I just need her to do some grovelling honestly but it's like she's not sure if she wants to continue.
I would appreciate some serious advice about how to navigate this before we see a therapist.
Maybe we're just not meant to be but l'm so in love it's just too hard.
Any way - this has been my story and it felt g to tell it honestly.

I am a singer songwriter from Small Town, SC and I spent the last 9 months recording an album with a musical partner and wanted to see if y'all had any feedback for us?  All 12 songs are written by me, JD Boatwright, and were recorded in a home studio. IMO, this is a singer-songwriter folk type album that leans rock, but I'd be interested in other perspectives.

‚ÄúSongs Outta My Head‚Äù is a collection of 12 songs written about life experienced in Rural America down in the Deep South.  Where life experience is delineated with heartbreak, newfound love, death, moonshine and moonlight.   Where summertime‚Äôs sweltering heat in the dog days can leave you begging for forgiveness and laden with journeys that require foot travel for long distances‚Ä¶for your sake and the public‚Äôs sake. Where your family can love you to death and drive you crazy.   A life where legends of the past inspire the future.  A life that acknowledges grace is required for us ALL to progress.

My music consists of life experiences‚Ä¶.some of those experiences are my own‚Ä¶some are characters based on people in my travels or home community.  Art is about taking our combined lived experiences and sharing them with the world.  I think all of the songs on this album are all stories worth telling and worth your time to hear them.  I hope my music, my art, is a bridge that connects otherwise strange bedfellows and I hope my art is a force for promoting positivity. I would like to thank JR Hall for his partnership and leadership during the recording and editing and mastering of this album.  He has become a driving force in bringing the sounds from inside my head into a place that I can share them with others.  JR really helped take sketches/outlines /compositions to fully fleshed out works of art. From his mandolin-playing to accordion-playing to challenging me to stay in time/key, he has really helped me become a better musician over the past 9 months of working on this album.  I‚Äôd like to thank all the other musicians that worked on this album including my friend Andrew Clark(bass) for coming and laying down some sweet grooves/vibes.  I‚Äôd also like to thank Steel/Dobro maestro Reggie Duncan and Fiddle Jessie M and all the other players involved for the high level of work that they put into this.

What are my music goals?  Make sense from the sounds in my head.  The things I wanna say, the things I have to say, and the things that just come from the ether.  When they overlap, sometimes it‚Äôs harmonic, sometimes it's dissonance.  It‚Äôs sorting and structuring and expounding and editing and editing and more editing.  Polish the good and compost the rest.  Rinse and repeat.  That is all just my process to write the [song.My](http://song.My) goal is to make my art/my music to my standard.  I don‚Äôt think success is defined by views or likes or dollars.  Sure, positive reinforcement is great, but some bird dogs are gonna point, even if nobody is watching or cares.  I‚Äôve been writing songs for well over 20 years and am going to continue regardless if my album has one listen or one billion.  I am not expectant nor reticent, positive or negative.  I know who I am, I am coooooooooooooool with that

Long story short, I do hope you give my album a listen.  I hope you put it on while drinking coffee, or doing laundry or when meditating.  I hope you crank it up while sunbathing on the beach or put it on your earbuds while mowing the grass.  I hope you blast 'em while having a party with your community.  I hope you enjoy it while watching a magnificent sunset with your loved one. I hope you feel the positivity and good vibrations that music has provided me with over my life experience.  It has been proven repeatedly in my life that music enhances everything.  Good music can be the cherry on top when things are good, it can be a salve when you are broken, and a crutch when you need something to lean on.

Most of all, I hope my music makes your life better.",1,1729470783.0,Songwriting,0,1.0,False

1g8dd0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1g8dd0h/running_1st_marathon_what_selfie_stick_do_i_go/,"Running 1st marathon, what selfie stick do I go with?","I have started my training plan 19 weeks ago. I run alternating weeks of 4 run days and 5 run days per week. I run any where from 30-45 miles a week. 
I eat before every long run, usually a double serving of oatmeal with a Kirkland protein shake and majority of my easy runs I eat just 1 banana and for my speed work, I typically eat 1 serving of oatmeal and 1 banana and a smaller protein shake.
 Before all my runs I always have a homemade coldbrew coffee, with locally roasted fresh coffee beans.

I run most of my runs in Hoka Mach 5s and 6s. I really prefer the 5s over the 6s. I feel as if the toe box on the Mach 5s are wider and more comfortable. I do own a pair of Brooks ghost but I don't really care for them so I save those for the rain days. 

I have always wanted to be a trail runner, I find those people to be really cool! It looks so much fun but I don't live anywhere near a trail running area. My family moved to NYC, so most of all my runs are on the city road. Which isn't ideal because there are so many people in NYC, but it is what it is. 

Anyways, I have a marathon coming up and I was thinking about how cool it would be to videotape it. I have seen so many people on tiktok doing this, ""this is me at mile x"" and I was hoping to do that too!
I was thinking I could post it on tiktok and tag the link to the video on this post later on when I run my marathon and you all can watch it! 
I heard you can make a lot of money if you get rich and famous!!!!!!!!!

So my question is, I am running my marathon in a few weeks and I was hoping to find out what kind of selfie stick I should go with???

I have an android phone. If that helps. It is a galaxy s21 ultra.(crack in the screen top left corner) I do have a phone case. The phone case is just a cheaper phone case I bought off amazon prime that I use and share account with my 2 sisters and 1 brother. 
I do not mind buying a new phone case that would be better fit for a selfie stick so I can record my marathon. But this current phone case has some cool sticker graphics on it so I would rather the selfie stick be more universal to adapt to any type of phone case? 

I hope to hear back from anyone who has feed back of running with a selfie stick, or should I just hold my phone??

Or can I ask a fellow runner to hold my phone for me? That would be cool cause then if someone held my phone for me I can get some cool running video shots of me running past the phone. And it would save me the hassle of having to stop and go back and retrieve my phone.

Which is why I was looking for recommendations on a selfie stick that I can use on my generic sticker bombed phone case so I can run my marathon and record it and post it on tiktok and I will copy the link and tag it to this post so you guys can watch it and see how well I did.

1g8dc5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g8dc5v/i_29f_chose_a_man_30m_over_my_best_friend_29m/,I (29f) chose a man (30m) over my best friend (29m),"The title sounds terrible and it is. I don't like anything about the situation and honestly, I'm probably in the wrong. I'd really appreciate some honest unbiased insight. 

There's a lot of back story so bare with me. I, 29f, moved to my hometown a year and a half ago. I left my ex fiance after a decade. At some point over the years, he had become emotionally abusive and I realized he was never going to change. 

I had to start over completely in a tiny basement in a city I left at 17. I had no money. My ADHD and autism become disabling when my stress is high so I had been struggling to work more than part time. I could only bring what I could fit in a friend's car and my ex kept the dogs which broke my heart more than anything else. So yeah, it was a lot. 

I was lonely and lost when I arrived. 

I decided to focus on connecting with people after years of an isolating life. I decided to reach out to a couple old friends from highschool, one of which was ""Alex"" 29m.

Alex and I first met in our 4th grade class but didn't become close until grade 11. Back then I always thought he was the smartest person I ever met. He was really creative with a crazy memory. He always gave the best gifts and never forgot an occasion. 

But he often had an attitude. He was judgy and looked down on people. He could also be needy, but he was my friend and I gave him a lot of patience. I let a lot go. His home life was very toxic, and he was also the only openly trans kid in our school, so he didn't really have it easy. 

After high school we kept in touch but about 7ish years ago I had to cut contact. I won't get into specifics, but he had done something manipulative and toxic when he was in a dark place and by that point I was getting a stronger backbone. It was definitely for the best at the time. 

Anyways, I know I've grown a lot in 7 years, so I figured maybe Alex also had. I decided to reach out and we met up for coffee. 

Honestly, it went great. He really seemed to have chilled out and made his own found family in his roommates. He seemed the happiest I'd seen him. Despite multiple life changing permanent disabilities, he found peace. He still struggled with alcohol addiction, but this was the best I'd seen his life. 

We then started hanging out on a regular basis. We were connecting well and building trust. 

Around this time, I ended up checking myself into the hospital because my mental health was getting really bad after losing the life I've known for a decade. Depression had become impending doom so I was in there voluntarily for 5 days, and then got a whole hell of a lot of therapy after. I can say, it all helped tremendously. 

Alex has been in that same ward about 5 times (not in the last 5 or so years apparently) so I definitely leaned on him a lot during the whole process. It definitely made it less scary.

After I was out and doing better, I got to know his friends. They gave me kitchen stuff so I wouldnt have to eat off paper plates. Extra pillows. Alex let me borrow some craft supplies and switch games. Bought me groceries one time when I was struggling. I did my best to spoil my good friend back when I could, but I was just so touched at all of their kindness during a hard time. 

There was only one issue really. He really didn't like that I was dating soon after my breakup. 

I know it sounds like that's because he's into me, I really don't think so. He now identifies as asexual and says he has no interest in romantic partners. It wasn't always the case, but I don't think he'd lie about his sexuality. Though I will say he has a history of intense limerence. 

Anyways, I wasn't looking for a long term partner so soon after my break up. But I definitely wanted to date, have fun, connect with people. If love lands in my lap, whatever. But definitely wasn't looking for it. After years of an unkind partner, I was excited to enjoy being single. 

He would word it like he was concerned I was dating while he still thought I was vulnerable. That would've been a totally valid and appreciated concern. Not his call to make for me, but valid. But he started getting snippy about it. Made judgy expressions when I talked about the new friends I was making (when he was the one who asked). He would, in a joking tone, call me a relationship addict on a regular basis. I honestly laughed most of it off. At the time I thought he was being overprotective. In every other way, he was an amazing friend. 

Then, 4 months after I moved, I reconnected with ""Gerard"" 30m. We met 6 years earlier when I was still living with my ex. He was a truly amazing person, but my ex didn't like me being friends with guys so our friendship faded long before. I never forgot him though. I'm a very sensitive, quirky person, and meeting others like me are few and far between. When we started seeing eachother again, it didn't take long before my heart felt at home like it never had before. I was truly amazed by this man every single day. As someone with a lot of trauma and anxiety, I felt safe with him in ways I couldn't with others. So, it got serious. 

And Alex started getting possessive of my time. At this point I had a part time job, more friends than when I first arrived, and had a new guy in my life who lived an hour away.

He would send me late night messages (while drinking) making me feel like a crappy friend after all he had done to help me. One message said he knew that if I had one weekend free in a month, he's worried that now I'll choose to spend it with Gerard instead of someone I've known all my life. I tried my best to balance my friendship and my life, but this was so guilt trippy. 

I had already started communicating more and more firmly about boundaries, so when he said that, I told him he's important to me, but he's not the only thing in my life and that he's starting to push me away. He profusely apologized. 

But he kept making these little jabs at me. When he wasnt doing well, I checked in. Asked if he needed anything. He said something like, ""no that's okay, checking in is already better treatment than I'm used to :)"". 

I'll say, I'm not the only friend he treats like this. I noticed his childhood best friend really keeps him at arm's length these days, but Alex almost seems in denial about it. He said he just needs to wait until he grinds at work for a few more years and then he'll have more time for him. He sees him maybe once a year. 

So, I started retreating honestly. I truly was choosing to spend more days with Gerard over Alex. I felt really bad about abandoning someone with abandonment issues, but I started getting uncomfortable. The more distant I got, the more more he got upset about it. I tried to communicate it wasn't about Gerard - it was about how he was acting. I tried to reassure him as well, that I cared about him. Maybe I wasn't communicating that enough. We still hung out but not as much and it just wasn't the same. 

Gerard never said anything bad about him. He let me rant, and offered gentle advice. No pushing or judging. He genuinely hoped Alex could put his insecurities aside. But hanging out with him got less and less fun with his moods and jabs. After 2 months of seeing Gerard, hanging out with Alex trickled to once every few weeks. 

Then, a few months later, I had to move out of my friends basement. They were a growing family, so totally understandable. That's when Gerard invited me to live with him. I wouldn't have moved in with anyone else after 6 months, lol. Our timeline was after 1 to 1.5 years. But honestly, we were ready when the timing presented itself. And I don't drive so he was driving me an hour to and from his place a lot of the time. So I happily accepted.

Since then, he has been happy to take me back to my hometown regularly, however I didn't ever have the energy to see Alex. Honestly I started ghosting him quite a bit. I felt guilty to do that to a friend who helped me so much. But at the same time, a lot of what he did to help me almost feels like a weird friendship version of being love bombed.

I'll be honest, I still had a few things of his I needed to return and was still avoiding his messages. 

Then one night this past July, 3 months after I moved, I recieved a wall of drunken angry texts. Very aggressive and accusatory. I read up until he called me explaining my feelings ""weaponized therapy speak"" and I stopped reading. 

This is where I'm probably in the wrong. 

I sent a message that just said: ""address?"" Then one that said something like ""your things will be in the mail by Monday"" and then blocked him off everything. 

And I did. Rounded up all of the things he loaned me, packed them up and shipped them back. The whole situation made me feel so icky in the moment I rounded up the gifts he gave me over the years and threw them in the dumpster. 

It's three months later, and the whole thing just doesn't sit right. I don't really feel bad anymore that the friendship ended, but I really feel like I handled it like crap. Should I reach back out to offer closure if he wants to know why I'm not in his life? If I do, how do I set boundaries so he isn't just nasty about it? Should I apologize for ghosting instead of trying harder to communicate my feelings (even though honestly they were never really heard)? I appreciate your time and advice. 

(Little side note for those who want to know, Gerard and I are a year in now and life is truly beautiful. We just got back from our dream-witchy-roadtrip vacation!)

Do any of you consider yourself a part of this subculture? I feel incredibly isolated from the women at my parish save a couple of souls. Ever since my husband and I moved states, I haven‚Äôt been able to cultivate that deeply imperative female connection. The kind where you can lay all your insecurities in the open without judgement. I recently had a falling out with a woman at my parish I was particularly close to - long story short, I genuinely offered an apology after a miscommunication and she outright rejected me and has since avoided me like the plague. It‚Äôs very awkward and of course the deeper pain to this has been addressed with my spiritual father. 

All that to say, I could really use some female companionship. It‚Äôs been almost three years of a shortage/drought of this important friendship (since moving), and I‚Äôm literally asking for a friend. Double bonus if you‚Äôre a goth girlie. I have a very surface level connection during coffee hour with most of the women at my parish and I guess making friends in your 30s is harder than I thought especially after putting yourself out there.

Prior to being spayed she was honestly perfect, she was fully potty trained, we could leave her out of her kennel when we left and she wouldn‚Äôt do anything wrong!  After she got spayed she began having accidents and I did research and found that this is pretty common after spay.  I began taking her out every hour and went back into potty training mode. The peeing isn‚Äôt super frequent, I don‚Äôt think anything is wrong necessarily but she is still having accidents at least once a day.  I‚Äôm not reprimanding her unless I see her in the act, if I catch her I immediately take her outside and say ‚Äúpotty outside‚Äù. 

On top of this her energy levels are through the roof. I always walk her daily and we go outside and play ball for quite some time, this used to be more than enough and these days it‚Äôs not even close to being enough. She‚Äôs beginning to chew things up, she chewed up the couch and continues to try and chew up the coffee table. 

Today she peed on the couch which is BIZARRE to me.  She has never peed on anything other than the floor. 

Can someone just tell me if this is normal?  I‚Äôm just so confused with what‚Äôs happening.  Could she just be regressing and in her ‚Äúterrible twos‚Äù stage?

- Sometimes I cant think straight or focus worse than normal? Usually its accompanied by the panic and jitters (this is something that frequently happens to me when i have panic attacks)
- increased anxiety and ocd symptoms 
- sun sensitivity
- unfocused vision and pressure behind my eyes

I've now had a second item go ""missing"" in transit, and this is a large, pretty pricey item, very obvious what it is - they don't re-box large items like this. I'm wondering how something covered in delivery labels and scanned every step of the way goes missing en route. Again this is Amazon direct, not a third party delivery service, both times.

Now granted these items are free to us, but it stings all the same when it's something really useful you're looking forward to. Some months back we had a scooter go missing that we were really looking forward to using for my partner to commute to work when it was warm enough. It's too long to walk and I can't drive her due to my job. We can't afford buying a car just for this. Taxis are expensive and she takes those enough in the winter. Rides are scarce and put people in an imposition. Uber doesn't exist here. A bike would work, but she didn't want to be all sweaty arriving at work on hot days in the summer. A scooter was the perfect fix! But, it went missing before it got to us. It was on the truck, then just gone. If items are scanned when loaded onto the truck and scanned when taken off, how does this happen?

Now, a large and heavy espresso machine we were looking forward to testing has also gone missing. This one was unique, having a ""cold extraction"" technology that coffee-geek me was looking forward to putting through the paces. It showed it was on the truck, then the Amazon driver said it was missing when he dropped off everything else and said another truck would deliver it (which we thought was curious), and then it continued to show out for delivery, with his little truck icon on the map driving away, supposedly with the item still onboard...

I'm not going to level any accusations but it really makes me wonder how items like this disappear. We do get successful delivery of other obvious high-ticket items, and plenty of other regular items - even the small padded-envelope sized items basically *never* go missing. Seems sus overall....

It would be nice to make someone there aware of this; of course complaining to CS only gets offers of refunds, and we wouldn't  really dare ask Vine CS besides to just remove the item, and there seems to be nowhere to really report what is going on at all. It probably really doesn't matter to Amazon, but still. It's kind of the pricinpal.

*As an addendum to my previous message, life can't be reduced to black or white, up or down, straight or gay, man or woman. There are infinite shades of gray. Human sexuality is much more complex than that. Sexuality exists on a spectrum and, even though I'm a real woman, I'm certain that men exist on a continuum. Most men are predominantly straight and want a real woman, but they might end up taking a walk on the wild side under unusual circumstances. By the same token, most gay men would never go back to being gay after having intercourse with a woman. So, you can't just reduce human sexuality to a binary concept. Plus, I don't care. Like to me, straight, gay, bi do not exist. They are made up categories. I'm past that. I literally forget what people are. To me, someone straight vs gay is like someone preferring their coffee with or without cream. Those differences don't exist.*¬†

*I've seen the photos of your crush and brace yourself, but all I see is a str8, very heterosexual man. You're setting yourself up for disappointment. Run, baby, run run for the hills... and run fast. I don't want you to do that to yourself. He would never go for you. He's str8. You'll be torturing yourself.¬†It's a long shot, but I think that trans women would do best in prison. When men have no access to real women, out of desperation, they might overlook the fact that someone has transed because there aren't real women avaiable.¬†But please don't do this for yourself. Stop obsessing over this guy. He's str8*

1g8cleh,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1g8cleh/why_are_men/,Why are men?,"I recently went through a bad break up and was discarded after a 4 year toxic relationship.  I decided to get on the apps and look for a distraction/fun.  I was not and am not ready to jump into anything.  I met this guy who lived over an hour away.  He messaged me and wanted to meet up so we met for coffee one night.  He was very attractive and seemed super kind.  Said he was divorced for two years and has 3 young girls that he has part-time custody to.  I can tell he was very attracted to me and asked if I'd like to get dinner.  So we found a place and had dinner.  He blushed everytime he looked at me.  He brought up sexy talk which I always find sort of off putting on a first date, but I reminded myself I am not looking for a relationship so I went along with it.  It wasn't much, just talk about kinks, etc.  He didn't try to sleep with me or even kiss me that night.  He later texted me that night asking if I'd want to go to his house for dinner the next night.  Being it was a Sunday I didn't want to drive all the way out there.  And seeing someone the next day after a first date seemed like a lot.  I was also really really upset about the recent break up and wanted to have some fun so I invited him to my place.  He came, I made him dinner and he was very polite and sweet and we ended up sleeping together and the sex was amazing.  He was blown away by it and said he has had a hard time finding partners with this kind of chemistry.  We made plans for me to go to his place that Friday coming up.  He left that night and tried to come back again the next night saying it was worth the drive.  He was still texting me every day checking in and asking how my day was.  FaceTimed me at work once saying he just wanted to see my face and was all excited to see me on Friday.   

Friday comes along and I drive out to him.  He made me dinner and we played a game and he was very flirty and kept blushing when he looked at me.  Kept telling me how beautiful I am, etc.   Also this man is extremely attractive himself and very masculine.  He opened up about an auto-immunie disorder he had and told me about when he was diagnosed and his symptoms, etc.  I was under the impression he liked me more than just sex bythe way he acted around me.  We had another night of amazing sex and the next morning he went to the gym and came back and he wanted to go with me to this antique store I wanted to check out so we went together.  During this excursion, he opened up about some bad stuff about his past and his divorce.  His wife accused him of abuse and he had some allegations of abuse.  He swore up and down it was just mutual shoving (and admitted that is not good, they just had a toxic relationship towards the end) and she called the cops blaming him.  She also has a PFA on him with a stipulation that he can speak to her if it involves kids.  He is also on probation.  It was a lot to take in and it seemed hard to believe considering how sweet and kind he came off.  He kept asking me if I would come back and I said 'well see'.  

I went home and did a background check and found the abuse allegations.  There were 3 all within the last 2 years of his marriage, nothing before that.  The stories didn't really add up, and I was hoping to speak to him again about it.  He kind of disappeared after that though.  His texts became less and less and I asked him if he was being distant because of what he told me and he got very dismissive and rude and said he could care less that I know that stuff.  Then said the truth is he started talking to someone today and she is the one he pushed away.  I didn't really respond.  It seemed weird considering how into me he was.  

A week later I saw him on another dating app and accidentally swiped right while looking at his profile.  He shortly matched with me after saying 'Hey' and asked if I wanted to come over, in kind of a jokey way.  I then said I thought he had a new girl and how he wasn't very nice to me.  He said 'yeah the new girl didn't work out and he was never mean to me' I reassured him that he was and he apologized and said he was very on edge that day.   I said okay but I haven't heard from him again and it seemed like he was pushing ME away.  He just said 'sry'.  I told him he was scared of me and he just responded with an eye roll emoji.  

  
I know this man is bad for me, but the sexual connection was so good and he put me in my feminine energy and no one has done that in years.  I'm not saying I want to date this man, but was hoping for a bit more fun as I didn't feel threatened by him or scared of him.  I am so confused as to why he would just drop me.  If there was another girl and she didn't 'work out' then why is he still not trying?   Was I love bombed and used?  If so, he really fooled me!  My friends think things got too personal and he couldn't handle it.  I don't know.  When we parted ways he was still hoping I'd come see him again.  Just sucks and I hate that I'm still even thinking about him or why this happened. ",2,1729468324.0,heartbreak,7,0.75,False

In Our Lovely Deseret

1.In our lovely Deseret,

Where the Saints of God have met,

There‚Äôs a multitude of children all around.

They are generous and brave;

They have precious souls to save;

They must listen and obey the gospel‚Äôs sound.

CHORUS:
Hark! Hark! Hark! ‚Äôtis children‚Äôs music‚Äî

Children‚Äôs voices, oh, how sweet,

When in innocence and love,

Like the angels up above,

They with happy hearts and cheerful faces meet.

2.That the children may live long

And be beautiful and strong,

Tea and coffee and tobacco they despise,

Drink no liquor, and they eat

But a very little meat;

They are seeking to be great and good and wise.



3.They should be instructed young

How to watch and guard the tongue,

And their tempers train and evil passions bind;

They should always be polite,

And treat ev‚Äôrybody right,

And in ev‚Äôry place be affable and kind.


4.They must not forget to pray,

Night and morning ev‚Äôry day,

For the Lord to keep them safe from ev‚Äôry ill,

And assist them to do right,

That with all their mind and might

They may love him and may learn to do his will.

No, you're not hallucinating and this is not a mod, this is officially Alan Wake playable and in Bright Falls taken from a website that mentions this bizarre glitch. This glitch requires you be at a save spot where the Reality Shift and the Coffee save are really close together. Once you find the safe room with the desired character of your choosing, quicksave and reality shift as fast as humanly possible. If the quicksave icon is still spinning after entering another reality, you may get a¬†**second**¬†save icon. If both are spinning, this glitch most likely has worked. It might require a potato PC to be able to slow down the saving. But once this glitch is performed, Saga should be able to be in the Dark Place and Alan in Bright Falls depending on who you're playing as.

Though I highly recommend playing this at the LAST mission before the point of no return of both characters as doing this in early chapters might not work well such as Alan's manuscript manipulation puzzles while playing as Saga and potentially have some bizarre cutscenes.

Though I've been struggling to attempt this glitch myself, it's still a fun one to discuss with. If you have any alternative solutions to execute this glitch, let me know down below.",1,1729468184.0,AlanWake,0,1.0,False

The float switch works and goes short circuit when water is added to the reservoir.

Had loads of dates over those 2 months and genuinely felt like we built up an emotional connection although finding time for each other has been a challenge as she has a young daughter and wanted us to build a relationship first before socialising around her - something I was also fine with.
After one of our recent dates she shared that the only time she would definitely be available to see me was on weekends every two weeks when her ex has their daughter. I found this tough as I was wanting to increase the frequency of our dates as opposed to the other way around but I eventually made peace with the idea as I liked her so much.
Aware that it was still early in the relationship, I told her I was beginning to develop feelings for her and she said she was comfortable with it.
Unfortunately she became aware of an incident the last time her ex had their daughter and due to this he wouldn‚Äôt be seeing her for the foreseeable future. She was very upset about this and we didn‚Äôt speak much for a couple of days, she just told me something had happened. 
We met for coffee in the daytime earlier this week and she told me the details. I did really appreciate her being open and showing vulnerability. We discussed the knock on effect on us, being that she now would be unable to see me every two weeks either. She said from now on (at least in the short term) our meetings would be ad-hoc and she‚Äôd just let me know. 
We agreed to take things ‚Äòa day at a time‚Äô.
We didn‚Äôt discuss the details of this but I did promise to let her know if I felt things weren‚Äôt working for me.
To me, ‚Äòa day at a time‚Äô means - we‚Äôre good today, we‚Äôll see about tomorrow. Basically we both get flexibility to cut if we‚Äôre not happy.
Every day for months we‚Äôve messaged each other and this has been the case this week and we‚Äôve definitely had lots of laughs despite the tough context. Every day I wonder if she‚Äôll find time for me and every day she hasn‚Äôt - fine tbh as we did meet for coffee but wanting to highlight that I just don‚Äôt know. 
It gets to the weekend and I spend Friday and Saturday night alone. Saturday night I start to think it isn‚Äôt working for me and decide to see how I feel Sunday. Sunday she tells me about the busy day she has planned and I decide not to wait to tell her I want to break things off.
I genuinely didn‚Äôt think she would be that bothered. I thought at worst I may get a spikey comment or two but that she‚Äôd probably be relieved more than anything.
She called me selfish and accused me of abandoning her. I am stunned by her response. I anticipated something along the lines of agreement.
AITA
Was her sharing details of the issue with her ex supposed to indicate we were more serious or have I misunderstood ‚Äòtaking it a day at a time‚Äô?

With his startling green eyes and infectious smile, Sam pulls Lorcan in like a tide, making him feel seen for the first time in his life. But beneath Sam's irresistible charm lies a disturbing secret. After Lorcan witnesses the horrific abuse Sam suffers at the hands of Halloran and the villagers, Sam makes a shocking confession: he's a Selkie ‚Äì seal fae that shed their coats once every seven years to become beautiful humans on land. Captured by Halloran after overfishing nearly devastated the island, Sam is forced by brutal means to lure fish into the nets to keep the island alive and maintain Halloran's vice-like grip over the village. 

At the risk of inciting the wrath of Halloran and the villagers, Lorcan vows to help Sam find his stolen coat before the fish inevitably run out and Sam is killed. But as the summer wears on and Sam‚Äôs desperation to return to the sea begins to consume him, Lorcan is confronted with a heart-wrenching realization: freeing Sam means losing the one person who truly understands him. This leads Lorcan to question if he'll be able to let Sam go when ‚Äì or if ‚Äì they find his coat.

Recently, we‚Äôve had a new hire, Greg (35M), join the team. Greg‚Äôs incredibly smart‚Äîhe‚Äôs got great ideas and a solid background in data analysis, which is something we really needed. However, he‚Äôs not exactly the best when it comes to presenting those ideas to the rest of the team. He stumbles over his words, gets visibly nervous, and has trouble keeping people engaged.

I‚Äôve always been someone who enjoys helping others. I know presenting can be intimidating, and I‚Äôve been through similar struggles earlier in my career. So, naturally, I offered to help him out. During a team meeting, after Greg had a bit of a rough presentation, I casually said, ‚ÄúHey Greg, you‚Äôve got some really good points! If you ever want any tips on how to present better, I‚Äôd be happy to help you with that.‚Äù

At first, Greg seemed open to the idea. He smiled, thanked me, and said he‚Äôd think about it. So, a few days later, I followed up. We were having a coffee break in the office lounge, and I mentioned how a few small tweaks could really make a difference in his delivery. I offered to practice with him before his next big presentation. He nodded, looking a little uncomfortable, but didn‚Äôt say much. I figured he was just shy and needed time to warm up to the idea.

Fast forward to the following week, we were in another team meeting where Greg presented again. He still seemed nervous, so afterward, I privately suggested we meet after work for a little practice session. That‚Äôs when Greg completely snapped.

He looked at me with this intense expression and said, ‚ÄúEnough! Do you think I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù I was taken aback and tried to explain that I just wanted to help, but he interrupted me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not some charity case for you to feel better about yourself. You think I‚Äôm incompetent? That I can‚Äôt figure out how to do my job without your pity?‚Äù

He was visibly upset, and I could tell he‚Äôd been bottling this up. I stood there in shock, trying to find the right words, but Greg stormed off before I could say anything more. Everyone around us had noticed, and I felt awful. My other colleagues didn‚Äôt say much, but a few of them looked at me with raised eyebrows, like I‚Äôd overstepped some invisible line.

Now Greg avoids me in the office. He doesn‚Äôt sit near me during lunch, and he hasn‚Äôt responded to my emails about upcoming projects. I feel terrible. I was just trying to help, but I clearly hit a nerve. Was I being condescending without realizing it? Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have been so forward with my advice, but I genuinely thought I was helping.

So, AITA for offering to help Greg with his presentations and making him snap at me?",5,1729467741.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

I don't care if other In-n-out workers get mad at me for this but hopefully people spread this hack around. If enough people do it it'll probably get patched because it's that good. I know the economy sucks and people want to still go out it for cheap just like the old days so here we go! 

At innout we have a yes mentally to the customer meaning that you can work some magic and get lots of things for free. What I mean is you can order ANYTHING on the side for FREE (Except meat, or cheese). 

This means you can ask for tomato's on the side, pickles on the side, onion on the side, buns on the side, protein lettuce on the side, etc. So basically any topping on your burger including the bun or protein lettuce you can get for free. 

Some associates might run your bun on the side as a veggie burger plain, meaning there's nothing on it so they'll charge you 2.55 for just a bun which is dumb. Just ask them to make a special note or request you want buns on the side instead of charging you and they will. We do it at our store. 

But for everything else you don't have to ask. 

You can get all these toppings for free and as many as you want. 

The hack is get all your toppings on the side for free then your protein lettuce or burger bun then order as many meats on the side as needed (or have them put melted cheese on the meats) and then build the burger at your table.

Boom, you saved huge money by only paying for meats and cheese. Get frys if you want and get that water cup and make poor man's lemonade (some people just take soda anyway in a water cup, you won't get confronted no one will care). 

Poor man's lemonade is using the free lemons and add sugar with some water and it tastes good. 

They have to make this order for you and can't say jack shit because of our yes mentally to taking care of the customers even if they know you are cheating the system. 

Enjoy guys, this is how you legit get half off your food. Haven't seen this hack yet on social media but it could spread soon! 

Also we give out free coffee if you have your own container to put it into to (mug, flask, etc) so take advantage of this too

Remember to get your hot cocoa when it's raining outside. 


PS: another manager from innout came into our store and did this last week and my general manager handed out the order and was suspicious it was an innout employee because they only know about this, customers don't! But know you guys do too! I talked to him after he did this hack and he admitted to me he is a manager for innout. Don't feel bad about doing this, even people who work for the company do it.

1g8c0yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorhideout/comments/1g8c0yd/endless_road/,Endless Road ,"You ever have one of those moments where you question if what‚Äôs happening to you is real? Like, not just a bad dream, but something deeper? Something that makes you wonder if your entire reality is just‚Ä¶ wrong?

I don‚Äôt tell many people this, but a few months ago, something happened to me. Something I still can‚Äôt explain, and the more I try to figure it out, the more lost I feel. Maybe talking about it will help, but honestly, I‚Äôm not sure anymore.

It started on a Friday night, late‚Äîaround 1 AM. I was driving home from a friend‚Äôs place. The streets were dead quiet, and I was just listening to the hum of my engine and the occasional static from the radio. It was one of those nights where everything feels surreal, like the world is asleep and you‚Äôre the only one left.

I was only a few miles from home when I saw it. A car on the side of the road, hazard lights flashing. It was a dark sedan, looked pretty old, and there was a guy standing next to it, waving me down. I should‚Äôve kept driving. I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt. I mean, it was late, middle of nowhere, and something about the way he was waving felt‚Ä¶ off. But I pulled over.

The guy looked normal enough, wearing a jacket, jeans, but when I rolled down my window, he just stared at me for a second‚Äîlike he wasn‚Äôt expecting me to stop.

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù I asked.

He blinked, as if coming out of a trance, and nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, yeah. Uh, my car broke down. Think you could give me a ride to the gas station?‚Äù

Now, normally I‚Äôm cautious. But something about him made me feel like I had to help. Like there was no other option. So I unlocked the door, and he got in.

We didn‚Äôt talk much. He didn‚Äôt tell me his name, and I didn‚Äôt ask. But after a few minutes, I started feeling‚Ä¶ weird. Like I was being watched, but not by him. By something else. I glanced in my rearview mirror, and for a split second, I swear I saw someone in the backseat. Just a shape‚Äîbarely there, but enough to make my heart race.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just kept driving.

Then, about five minutes in, the guy turns to me and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here before.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

He looked at me, his face completely blank. ‚ÄúThis exact drive. This exact moment. You picked me up before.‚Äù

I laughed nervously, thinking maybe he was messing with me. ‚ÄúYeah, I doubt that. Must‚Äôve been someone else.‚Äù

He shook his head slowly. ‚ÄúNo. It was you. And I‚Äôll prove it.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when he started describing things. Not just general stuff, but specific details. He knew what I had in my glove compartment‚Äîa receipt from a coffee shop I‚Äôd been to earlier that day. He described the air freshener hanging from my mirror, the little tear in the fabric of my passenger seat.

I hadn‚Äôt shown him any of that. There‚Äôs no way he could‚Äôve known.

My stomach was in knots, and I wanted to pull over, kick him out, but something kept me driving. I felt trapped, like no matter what I did, I had to keep going.

Then, he said something that still chills me to the bone. ‚ÄúThis is the part where you try to drop me off at the gas station, but you never make it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you talking about?‚Äù I asked, my voice shaking now. I glanced at the GPS. The gas station was only a mile away. I could see the lights up ahead.

He smiled, this slow, creeping smile that made my skin crawl. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already done this. Over and over again. Every time you try to get there, something happens. Something stops you. And you end up right back where you started.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt believe him. I couldn‚Äôt. But when I looked at the road ahead, something changed. The gas station lights flickered, and then‚Ä¶ they were gone. The road stretched out endlessly in front of me, no buildings, no signs, just darkness. Like the world had shifted, and I was the only one who noticed.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù I muttered, gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles turned white.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stuck,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been stuck for a long time. You just don‚Äôt remember.‚Äù

I slammed on the brakes, heart pounding, and turned to face him. But he wasn‚Äôt there. The passenger seat was empty.

I stared, my breath coming in shallow gasps. How the hell could he have just disappeared? I looked around, frantically searching for any sign of him. But then I noticed something even worse.

The road outside my window‚Ä¶ I recognized it. But not from earlier in the night. From last week. Last month. It was the same stretch of road I‚Äôd been driving on every Friday for the past few months, on my way home from my friend‚Äôs place. Always late at night. Always alone.

I slammed the gas pedal, trying to get back to the city, to any sign of life. But the road just kept stretching on, endlessly. I felt like I was driving for hours, but nothing changed. It was as if the world outside the car didn‚Äôt exist anymore‚Äîjust an infinite loop of the same road, the same dark horizon.

And then my phone buzzed. I fumbled for it, nearly dropping it in my panic. There was a new message from an unknown number. It said:

‚ÄúWelcome back.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I knew. I‚Äôd been here before. Just like he said. And I‚Äôll be here again.

So now I‚Äôm telling you‚Äîwhoever‚Äôs listening to this‚Äîif you ever find yourself driving late at night, and you see someone stranded on the side of the road‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt stop. Keep going. No matter what you feel, no matter how much you think they need help‚Äîdon‚Äôt stop.

It ended up being a magical weekend, and we were so grateful to our family and friends who came from near and far to celebrate with us. This subreddit was so helpful during the planning of our wedding, so I want to return the favor by sharing all the details in the hopes it makes someone else‚Äôs planning a little easier.

***Quick Info***

* 183 guests invited, 117 RSVP'd yes
* Started planning Nov 2023
* Tied the knot in Hopland, Mendocino County
* Vendors were mostly from the areas around Hopland and Mendocino, with a few from the San Francisco Bay Area
* Initial budget was $50k, ended up a bit over at $51,500. Not included in the budget are the cost of our rings and my husband‚Äôs custom suit (he got it made for a steal in Hoi An, Vietnam while we were there in March)
* Priorities were finding a venue we could use all weekend, having friends stay onsite at the venue with us, having a live band, and overall hosting a fun weekend for our families and friends.¬†

***Favorite Things***

* Having a weekend-long celebration. We invited a lot of guests from out of town, so it was nice to be able to host multiple events (Friday welcome dinner, Saturday wedding, Sunday brunch) to make their trips worthwhile and get a chance to talk to everyone.¬†
* Having friends stay at the venue with us for the weekend. Again, gave us opportunities to spend quality time with friends throughout the weekend. We ended up every night hanging out around and in the pool and hot tub. Friends had a blast enjoying the pool during the day on Saturday. And it made it easier to ask friends to help with setup on Saturday and cleanup on Sunday haha.¬†

***Lesson's Learned/Tips***

* Ask for and accept help! It took us too long to figure this one out, but we eventually got there. Luckily we have family and friend who knew better than us. My husband‚Äôs parents rented a massive truck with a huge truck bed, which was clutch for transporting things to and from Hopland (we were coming from Oakland in my little Prius). Our friends all pitched in and helped with a bunch of setup on Saturday morning, and were proactive about asking if they could help throughout the weekend.¬†
* Try to get some good sleep before the big day. Although we failed big time on this one, but we made it work (thanks endorphins!).¬†
* Give yourself time to recover physically and emotionally after the wedding weekend ends. We had a blast all weekend, but then crashed hard on Sunday when we came home. We were both physically a mess (tired, headaches, neck spasms, etc), and feeling the come-down from the wedding high. My emotions were all over the place. I can‚Äôt imagine going straight to a honeymoon after our wedding, I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to enjoy it as much as I would like.¬†

***Budget Breakdown***

**Catering (\~$12.8k):** We used [Mendough‚Äôs](https://mendoughs.com/) for the wedding food, and they knocked it out of the park. We mostly eat vegetarian/pescatarian food at home and had many vegetarian guests, so we wanted to serve food that was flavorful and in line with the way we eat normally. They served local, seasonal, veggie-forward farm-to-table food that I would describe as California/Mediterranean style. Our guests kept telling us how much they enjoyed it, and we saw several people at our table get second servings. My favorite quote from a friend was ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe they had three types of salad!‚Äù. Our contract included appetizers, buffet dinner, and coffee/tea service. The owners even came to our venue months ahead of time to make sure they had everything they needed to provide a great meal for our guests.¬†

**Venue (\~$9k):** We hosted the first (!) wedding at our venue, [Glynraven Gardens](https://www.glynravengardens.com/), so we received a special one-time rate. It‚Äôs still going to a great deal compared to other venues in the vicinity with everything it has to offer. It‚Äôs a magical property in the hills of Hopland with wild peacocks, an amazing infinity pool and hot tub, and epic views. It‚Äôs got burning man-meets-Mendocino vibes, in the best possible way (did I mention it‚Äôs also a pot farm?). We stayed there before for weekend trips and fell in love with the venue, and we were so excited to see everyone else also become enchanted with this special place. There are various accommodations (Airstream, shipping containers-turned-unique lodging, yurts, campsites) where our friends stayed, and asking them to chip in for lodging also helped us recoup some of the costs. Plus everyone (adults and kids) LOVED the pool and hot tub. The owner Antler is a total sweetheart, and he worked closely together with all our vendors to make sure the weekend went off without a hitch.¬†

**Band (\~$7k):** Our band [Mercy and the Heartbeats](https://www.instagram.com/mercyandtheheartbeats/?hl=en) crushed their set! They totally got our vibe and performed a high energy pop music set. The dance floor was packed the whole night. Our friends tried their best to get them to keep playing after their set ended by chanting ‚Äúmore sax!‚Äù for about five minutes. They were easy to work with and responsive during all the lead up, and they learned a Jewish hora dance song per our request. They were totally professional and easy going during setup and didn‚Äôt need any extra support or logistics on the day of the event.¬†

**Rentals (\~$5.7k):** We used Lake Event Rentals for farm tables, plates/cutlery, glasses, dance floor rental, and a couple other miscellaneous items. We used Sully Supply for a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù restroom trailer (the things you learn planning a wedding!). Both vendors were great to work with and open to delivering to a new venue.¬†

**Wedding Planner + Staffing (\~$4k):** Samantha and Steph from [Lunar Love Weddings](https://www.lunarloveweddings.com/) were instrumental for planning our wedding weekend. Samantha got our vision right from the first phone call when I told her about the venue and our budget. Her pricing was transparent and fair (and public on her website! which is rare I‚Äôve now learned), and she never tried to upsell us on a more expensive package. On top of all that, she started working with us 9 months before the wedding because we were going out of the country for a few months and didn‚Äôt want to worry about wedding planning while we were traveling. Our package included coordination, day-of staffing to help with setup, serving drinks, cleaning, and takedown, and some decor rentals.¬† ¬†

**Guest Transportation (\~$3.5k):** [First Class Transportation](https://www.instagram.com/firstclass_transportation/) arranged shuttles to/from the venue for guests staying in downtown Hopland. The owner Taylor went above and beyond to help us figure out logistics, including visiting the venue several times to make sure everything would work out smoothly. He‚Äôs super responsive and easy to communicate with, and genuinely wanted to make sure our guests had a great experience.¬†

**Welcome Dinner (\~$3.5k):** We hosted our welcome dinner at Dancing Crow Vineyards. They were so nice to work with, and made the whole evening feel effortless. There were games outside for the kids, and tables both inside in the A/C and out on the covered patio. And of course the wine was delicious.¬†Marino‚Äôs in Ukiah catered a huge spread of lasagna, salad, and dessert.¬†

**Photographer (\~$3k):** Our friend Sharyce of [Ripple Rain Photography](https://www.instagram.com/ripplerainphotography/) is a talented wedding photographer that generously offered us a friends and family discount for 6 hours of her services. She did a great job capturing candid moments throughout the wedding, and got gorgeous shots during the golden hour mini photo session. She made me feel very comfortable in front of her camera, which is a big deal for me - I normally hates taking photos! So far we‚Äôve gotten the sneak peak photos back, which I do my best to show to everyone :) We‚Äôre really looking forward to seeing the full galley once it‚Äôs ready!

**Alcohol/Bar (\~$2k):** This includes wine, beer, hard liquor, sparking water, ice, and mixers for the whole weekend. We served two pre-mixed cocktails, wine, and beer at the wedding. Almost everything was bought at Costco, but we got the wine from Trader Joe‚Äôs. We over-purchased by a lot (whoops), so now we have beer at home to supply a few ragers. Lesson learned: don‚Äôt use online calculators to decide how much to buy!¬†

**Florals (\~$1.5k):** Victoria at [Flora Roots](https://floraroots.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqtBo5G_mccbNs4HfMDvHk_SsbNICN_V1OxxzUxmlKK72CWf_sc) designed a beautiful bouquet and table garlands for my wedding in Hopland, CA. I gave her an inspiration photo and described the venue, and she was able to match the vibe of the season and venue perfectly. The eucalyptus garlands were simple and beautiful and made the tablescape come to life.

**Hair/Make-Up (\~$1000):** I booked [Melissa](https://www.instagram.com/beauty.by.melissasue/) at Halo Salon in Ukiah for my wedding hair and makeup. Not only did my hair and makeup look amazing, she made me feel so calm and special and taken care of during a very hectic weekend. I received compliments all weekend about how great I looked.¬†Price includes hair and makeup trial, day before blowout, and day of hair and makeup.¬†

**Other Items to Mention:**¬†

**Sunday Brunch ($500):** served bagels and cream cheese from Schat‚Äôs Bakery in Ukiah and smoked salmon from Costco

**Attire ($300):** I bought my dress used from Brides for a Cause in Sacramento. First of all, it was a steal at $150 (!?!). And on top of that, all the proceeds support women-focused charities! What a cool organization. Alterations at Anatoly‚Äôs in Oakland were minor at $50 (replacing a missing button and adding cups for nipple coverage). I gave away my dress on Marketplace after the wedding and told the bride to keep the chain going of gifting the dress for free once she‚Äôs done with it.¬†

**Dessert ($240):** We served donuts from Susie Q's Donuts in Lakeport. They went FAST - it was the only food item we ran out of!¬†

#‚ñåMain stories covered:

>- **[COMING_UP]  The week ahead...** Feels like uncharted territory to be this far above 7,000 without any clear headwinds. There aren‚Äôt any clear tailwinds either, though, which is enough to get me nervous. But I‚Äôm excited for the possibilities in the Q3 earnings data. 

>  **PH:** We don‚Äôt have anything on the schedule, except for the payment of that **Philippine National Bank** [PNB 27.00 ‚ñº1.1%; 28% avgVol] stock dividend to a miniscule percentage of the total number of eligible recipients. 

>  **INT‚ÄôL:** Pretty quiet on the international front as well. We have a rate decision from the **Bank of Canada** on Thursday morning, and then a US jobless claims report on Friday.

>    - ***MB:*** **Canada** and the **Philippines** both saw their central banks pivot before the **US Federal Reserve**, so I‚Äôm interested to see if Canada will continue cutting and if so how aggressively it will do it. Their inflation rate fell to 1.6% in September, which has analysts calling for a chonky 50 basis point cut. Our inflation isn‚Äôt that low, but it isn‚Äôt materially different in that it surprised to the low side and gave our central bank the theoretical room to do more. Don‚Äôt look now, but spot gold prices just punched through $2,700/oz and Bitcoin is inching up toward the ‚Ç±4 million mark again. Gold analysts are thinking about $2,941/oz sometime in the next 12 months.

>- **[NEWS]  Robinsons Land sold ‚Ç±1.9B block of RCR at 5.3% discount...** **Robinsons Land** [RLC 16.32 ‚ñ≤0.4%; 35% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=4c39d92f8d0f0184abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] disclosed that it sold 318,902,800 shares of its REIT subsidiary, **RL Commercial REIT** [RCR 6.01 ‚ñº3.1%; 429% avgVol], in a block sale at ‚Ç±5.86/share for a total transaction value of approximately ‚Ç±1.87 billion. The share price was equivalent to a 5.3% discount from RCR‚Äôs closing price from the previous day. RLC said that the sale increased from 34.15% to 35.93%. Under the REIT Law, the minimum public float for a REIT is 33.33%.
>    - ***MB:*** The block sale strikes again. For those unfamiliar, a block sale is when a company like RLC hires an agent/bookrunner (in this case, **BPI Capital**) to put together a single transaction to sell a bunch of shares that it owns at a single per-share price. There could be one buyer or many, but the key is that everything is processed at the same time and at the same price. Here, we don‚Äôt know exactly who bought, but RLC did say that the ‚Äútransaction was anchored by high-quality long-only institutional investors.‚Äù Usually that phrase just means **SSS** and **GSIS** who have been common buyers of REIT block sale shares in recent months. If you‚Äôre an RCR bull, this was a buying opportunity.

>- **[AMA]  I‚Äôm Merkado Barkada, ask me anything! PART 1...** To celebrate breaching the **1 million weekly readers** mark, I asked you all to ask me anything, and offered a **‚Ç±200 Grab Food voucher** for any questions that were picked to be answered. You came through big time, and I had nearly 100 great questions to choose from. Here‚Äôs the first set of questions in what will probably be a two- or three-part series.

>  **Mac:  Do you see yourself doing MB for the rest of your life?**

>  **MB:** Love this vaguely threatening question. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be doing this exact configuration of MB work for the rest of my life, but I also don‚Äôt want to pretend that I know exactly how my life will go. Five years ago I had no idea that the newsletter would grow to produce content that a million people read every week. The way life works is humbling. I‚Äôm happy now, and so long as doing MB makes me happy, I don‚Äôt intend to change.
 
>  **spaceman spiff:  What are your top 3 learnings on how to have 1M readers through a daily anonymous newsletter in a niche field saturated with existing experts?**

>  **MB:** The biggest lesson is an affirmation of several sayings that play on the same theme: ‚Äúhard work beats talent‚Äù, ‚Äúyou miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take‚Äù, ‚Äúconsistency is key‚Äù, and ‚Äú80% of success is just showing up‚Äù. There are thousands of better investors, thousands of better writers, thousands of analysts with bigger followings and networks, but the thing that sets me apart is that I do the work every single day. I get up in the middle of the night, read the disclosures, and write (from scratch) the day‚Äôs work every single day. I think (but don‚Äôt know) that consistency has been a big part of my success in growing MB to this point.

>  **Ron Batuigas:  Does news gathering really make you a better trader/investor?**

>  **MB:** 100%. The past 5 years of doing this daily have made me a better investor. I don‚Äôt think reading the news will help every investing style. It‚Äôs irrelevant to technical traders. But as a long-term trader, reading the news daily has opened my eyes to an angle that I had not considered before: opportunistic buying. Before doing MB, I‚Äôd buy and hold my stocks for the long run, but I was not great at adding to my winners and cutting my losers. Now that I‚Äôm constantly bathing in news and reviewing my portfolio on a daily basis, I‚Äôve found that I‚Äôm better positioned to lean into buying opportunities for stocks that I‚Äôm already holding to make those returns better. News gathering has also filled in so many gaps in my overall understanding of how things work that I‚Äôm far less confused on a daily basis, and that level of comfort helps me trade with more confidence.

>  **VincentBongGogh:   Which PSE stock inspired you to start the journey?**

>  **MB:** Jollibee [JFC]. At the time I was eating Champ burgers once or twice a week, and bought JFC because I heard a few rumors about how quickly JFC was planning to expand and it seemed like a no-brainer. That was well over 10 years ago. Deep into The Before Times. I bought so long ago that I panic-sold my JFC at a marginal gain in the aftermath of the COVID crash. 

>  **Juan Luke:  Why did you leave your job as a corporate lawyer?**

>  **MB:** COVID took a lot of the shine off of the corporate lawyer ‚Äúfeel‚Äù for me. I found that I loved working within a team to solve real-world problems, but the lockdown and all the work-from-home really dragged a lot of the fun out of performing the corporate lawyer role. Sitting at home, chopping up contracts, not talking to anyone for hours on end--it started to feel like law firm life and I started to feel like I was being oppressed by the billable hour, even though I was salary.  

>  **Steven:  What‚Äôs your ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù drink?**

>  **MB:** Coffee if we're just talking about regular life. But if we‚Äôre talking about drinks with dinner or out with friends, my favorite is Pale Pilsen for beer or a Moscow Mule (vodka with ginger beer) if I‚Äôm out at a place that could serve it. SO GOOD. 

>    - ***MB:*** Thank you all for helping me celebrate 1M weekly readers! More questions and answers to come throughout the week.

1g8bsr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g8bsr8/i_had_an_affair_and_i_fell_so_in_love_but_i/,"I had an affair and I fell so in love but I struggled to leave my toxic marriage due to children. When I finally did, i backtracked and my affair partner ended it. This gave me the strength to leave but he had moved on the next day. ","  Hi, I don‚Äôt really know how to explain this without all of the judgement or the I got what I deserved, but really I‚Äôm looking for anonymous advice because I just feel so sick. 
I have been married for 15 years, and I have two of the most amazing perfect humans I could ever be so lucky to have. They are kind and funny and loving and I am so proud of them, they are my everything and I will always put them first. They are precious teens and just the lights of my life. 
Their dad, who I met as a teenager myself, is a controlling and abusive (not physically) partner. He does not have any patience for any of my needs and expects me to be at his mercy always, I get scared of everything in the relationship as he will get very angry at me. He has financial control over me, I have to send him my wages, he will question every penny I spend and look where I went to spend it (i.e a coffee shop location) i know my youngest is very receptive to his treatment of me and when he has finished shouting and I go upstairs she will come out her room and hug me and ask me if I am okay. He is however, a wonderful dad and when he isn‚Äôt being controlling I can be happy, he has loving sides and the family time is everything. 
As the kids got older I started my own career, which other than the financial benefit it had to our household, my husband truly hated the independence it gave me. I still had to send him most of my wages, but I did have a lot more spare than before. I could write a book on the abuse and control but it is beside the point, I‚Äôd stayed for the family unit. 
While working I met a friend, let‚Äôs call him Dave, and Dave was a wonderful person. He was very funny and understanding and we became very good friends - that was all it was, until one day it wasn‚Äôt. At first the attention was nice, and then i was looking forward to speaking to him (important note, my husband is away for work a lot and is not home much of the year). We began an emotional and then physical affair. He told me he loved me and after 4.5 months he told me to leave or he was ending it. This was too soon for me to decide to break my family up and change my children‚Äôs whole lives when I didn‚Äôt know him well enough. I don‚Äôt know how but he decided to stay, maybe two months later he gave me the same ultimatum by breaking up with me and dating someone the next day. During this week, I had a miscarriage and decided that it was him I wanted to be with. He hadn‚Äôt supported me through it but, if we would have been together he would have. When we are good, he is the best most supportive partner ever, when he ends it (and I‚Äôve don‚Äôt nothing bad to him, he will be cold towards me). Anyway, I told him that I would leave and he agreed to be together, I explained that due to the financial circumstances of my marriage I needed to get my life sorted to be able to support my children because really, I still needed to protect them, what if it didn‚Äôt work out? I needed to be in a position where I could support them, feed them and afford a house. 
So I started to do that, but I needed to do it with my husband so as I had the finances to put things into place. I moved house, I got a new job etc, but I couldn‚Äôt leave at first, due to the changes in the bills. They were a lot more than I could cope with. The control I had been under I couldn‚Äôt see I was giving all my wages and was only allowed ¬£500 of it for utilities but, the new bills were ¬£900 (not including rent). I was getting into debt but was too scared to ask for more money as he would question why I needed more, it‚Äôs funny when you‚Äôre in the abuse you don‚Äôt see what the actual situation is, I just didn‚Äôt understand how I would pay for things so I told Dave that I couldn‚Äôt leave right now as I needed to sort the finances, it was then one children‚Äôs birthday and I would not split up with him then as if I stayed those three months sorting my finances I will not hurt my child for the sake of a month, and y hen a month later my other child‚Äôs birthday and I just couldn‚Äôt leave at their birthdays. So from me saying I‚Äôm leaving, to moving, sorting and birthdays it‚Äôs over an 8 month period. I was then finally ready to leave. I am financially able to leave, I talked to my parents about moving back with them and I‚Äôm ready. I have the conversation with my husband (who has been away about 5 months of this 8 month period) and our child hears. He is hysterical, physically sick, doesn‚Äôt talk to me and I have a wobble, I tell the David, who I am deeply in love with that my kid heard. He says is that‚Äôs it? But I say I just need to sort my child first before I decide anything, he says that‚Äôs it but messages he loves me the next day. We are texting for a week completely normal, loving and planning things and I‚Äôm handling my child and he then ends things. I was absolutely devastated, like he made me so happy and I grieved the loss. I realised I needed to be brave. I messaged him 4 days later and said if I actually leave this time do we have a chance. He didn‚Äôt quite tell me, yes or no, he said he isn‚Äôt having an affair anymore. 
So I did it, I left my husband. And I went to see him (this is within 2 weeks) and he had already met someone!!! He went absolutely mad I was on my way over and called me a psycho and was very cruel. It was because she was on her way over. He called me after she left and we‚Äôve spoken every day for nearly a week, he told me he still loves me, but he thinks the damage is done. I begged; I told him I loved him. I explained why it took so long and he really has heard the abuse I‚Äôve had as I‚Äôve sent recordings. But he said he can‚Äôt. I am
Hurting so much, I know this is awful to say and I know it doesn‚Äôt matter but I guess it makes me feel better, the girl, she is not very attractive, I mean she isn‚Äôt ugly, but she isn‚Äôt special. And he has been talking to her for a few weeks. And I didn‚Äôt think she would matter. He had spent nearly a week texting me, told me he loves me but told me to date someone. I went on a date which he hated but I felt sick as it was only a distraction and I don‚Äôt want to move on by rebounding. He‚Äôs been sexting me and it was like we used to be. Then today he seemed off. And I knew it is because she is coming over tonight. After he had sexted me that morning. I asked him and he said yes. I said is she sleeping over and he said I was safe, I asked if he promised and he said where had this come from. I apologised and said sorry for asking, I know he wouldn‚Äôt sext me that morning and then do that tonight and also he said he wouldn‚Äôt so I shouldn‚Äôt have asked him to promise when he‚Äôd already said no. 
I then said I love you, have a nice date and he went mad at me. 
Said I was playing games, it was a mind fuck he was DONE with me. I begged and apologised. Said I hadn‚Äôt meant any games as I‚Äôd been clear throughout the breakup that I wanted to be with him, I‚Äôd been saying i love you for a few days. There was no game. 
He then blocked me. And I just need to feel better. This is why I took so long to end things. Because I didn‚Äôt want to risk my children over someone who might not fight for us or stick around. I needed to be in a place where I was able to support them alone if that‚Äôs what happened to me. 
And I‚Äôm sure that I deserve this after having an affair. But I am now heartbroken and would really like comforting advice on how to get over someone I had such a deep connection with. I hate he is messaging someone he doesn‚Äôt love to get over me when we could make it work. ",1,1729465939.0,offmychest,15,0.67,False

1g8bq68,https://www.reddit.com/r/bismarck/comments/1g8bq68/goldmark_property_managementbismarck_nd/,"Goldmark Property Management/bismarck, ND","COCKROACHES. 
I wanted to put this out there for ANYONE trying to rent with Goldmark. I‚Äôve already put a review on their page, but this needs to be out there to save everyone the awful experience I went through. My husband and I are a young couple. We moved here from Billings, MT while I was 25 weeks pregnant. We were hoping to start a life here and be close to family so with the baby coming we decided to rent with Goldmark, since it was one of the cheaper options. No, we didn‚Äôt expect it to be the nicest. There were a few cosmetic issues upon moving in but we weren‚Äôt picky. The first week I decided to hang lights up in our kitchen. I had my husband get up on the counter to hang them and he noticed piles of what looked like coffee grounds, we didn‚Äôt think much about it and left it for the time being. Flash forward to 3 weeks in, we noticed the first cockroach (in my pancake mix mind you). Now, I‚Äôm 28 weeks pregnant at this point. We didn‚Äôt even know it was a cockroach. We had to google reverse image search it because it was a strange bug we‚Äôd never seen. Instantly it was identified as a cockroach. Those piles of ‚Äúcoffee grounds‚Äù or ‚Äúwood shavings‚Äù? COCKROACH POOP AND SHEDDINGS. We started to look around, and lo and behold there‚Äôs cockroaches in our water heater closet which is in our soon to be BABIES room. Management did NOT work with us, and did NOT treat the problem correctly. They assured us they‚Äôd take care of it, and would get rid of the problem. We were not in a place to pay for a lease termination and monthly for someone else to move in. BUT, flash forward to me giving birth, what do I find after I come home from the hospital??? ANOTHER COCKROACH. So we had to find another apartment with a newborn baby, spend all of our savings to leave, and had to leave pretty much ALL our belongings. Our couch, our bed, our appliances, half our clothes, etc. We had to spend a god awful amount of money to clean and go through every single item making sure we didn‚Äôt bring them with us. Management was extremely rude, and KNEW about this problem and didn‚Äôt disclose it. Even knowing I was pregnant and about to have a baby!! They do not care about you, your safety, or the safety of your children. We are now in debt, but THANKFULLY out of those apartments and in somewhere safe but completely broke. Those apartments need to be torn down, burned down. Management refused to fumigate it and the cockroaches just keep coming back. Had the landlord Shelbe not been so awful and rude, and worked with us this whole situation could‚Äôve been different. 

Also side note : I was experiencing a lot of respiratory issues while living there which vanished once I left. I found cockroach poop in my vases, under my sinks, and the FINAL breaking point was when we went on a trip and came home to find it in our babies bassinet. We were gone within 3 days. 

Also side note : we didn‚Äôt just have to leave the items previously listed but also our babies bassinet and crib!! tv, dresser etc. 

These were the Riverpark apartment complexes, but who knows what other ones have them with how they choose to run their businesses.

To be frank, I think I just snacked on too many ships earlier in the day. I still feel full. Sometimes I wish I could eat more in a day, or at least one sitting, because my appetite is so sporadic. I nibble on food; I could be half starved and then take a single bite and be completely content again for at least an hour. I wish I was the sort of person who could regularly feast; the whole free meals a day standard is beyond me, I struggle with one and a half. Anyway, I think I'll just have my evening coffee and if I'm hungry later I'll make something small.

The wild animals are still bold as ever. Less fighting among the squirrels but the chipmunks are still screaming, angry things. They keep Peach and I entertained at least. Now that it is night and everyone is inside, I'm sure everyone will be swarming the yard for pears and seeds. I, on the other hand, will handle the laundry and maybe do a little writing if I find myself free of writer's block. We shall see.

# Why do we deal with FUD harshly?

Crypto projects operate differently from any other asset class. Most crypto investors, just like the crypto market, are highly volatile, emotional, and impatient. Few people can deal with large downswings and upswings without letting emotion in. When you consistently bring negativity or FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) into a memecoin with your comments, you are hurting not only the investment you made but also everyone else's investment and the work everyone shows up to do every day. You must realise your words and criticism's power over broader community sentiment. Sometimes, people use the term ""echo chamber"" to describe our moderation actions, and it's exactly right; a positive ""echo chamber"" is conducive to growth. Not treating negative comments in a memecoin community is like getting diagnosed with cancer and choosing to do nothing. Negativity kills everyone's work ethic, sentiment, drive, and motivation, and when you're dealing with a ""valueless"" token like a memecoin, those things ***mean everything***. You can go as far as to say that nothing else matters. That's why it's handled harshly and always will be: because it doesn't affect just you. It doesn't affect Miazaki. It affects everyone, especially those who work the hardest for your investment.

Although Miazaki has shown up every day for eight months for Kendu and will always do his best to act in its best interest, he is only one part of Kendu, and Kendu is much larger than him, which he'd tell you himself. He isn't solely responsible for the project's success; this isn't a CEO-leading project situation. Everyone has a part to play, and the growth we aim for is only possible when everyone steps up and becomes the CEO of their own Kendu output.

That culture permeates Telegram a lot more, so if you are Reddit-exclusive, you might believe that you are powerless to change the course of the project or that the responsibility isn't with you. Nothing could be further from the truth. Kendu is a canvas for anyone to paint on. Kendu Energy, Kendu Nights, Kendu Supplements, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Kush, Kendu Merch, Kendu Bracelets, etc., all come from the community thanks to the culture Miazaki created that enables exponential growth through community activation. And when you spread negativity, you stifle that growth. It hurts everyone. Instead of ""running it up"", when you spend time and energy FUDing instead of contributing real work like the hundreds if not thousands of people who took Kendu to ATH and will take it to its next ATH, you are actually ""running it down"", and that will never be tolerated for everyone else's sake. We will continue to protect the work and contributions the people driving Kendu forward make. And the Kendu community will fully support its active contributors.

To those actively engaging in FUD, I encourage you not to waste any more of your life. Just sell, move on, and find something else. Thousands of tokens are out there, and the door is always open.

# Why is dev selling?

Miazaki is not concerned with pumping your bags or the chart tomorrow. He is also okay with sentiment, price action, volume, etc., being low right now because he has the experience to know that this is temporary. He recently bought the ENS and named the Chads wallet ""miazakimeister.eth"" so that sales would be wholly transparent and literally labelled for all to see. Nothing is being hidden from you apart from *what* he's working on, which has been his stance from the beginning. There will be no roadmap or ""sell the news"" events created by Miazaki. He is just focused on his output like everyone else should be. Most devs in the space pre-snipe massive supply from undoxxed wallets and sell without you ever knowing it, and their profits don't go towards pushing the project forward. Miazaki publishes it, and you'll soon see what it's all for.

I understand your frustration and concerns with price action. It's painful to see the numbers on the screen go down unless you are emotionally detached from money and focused entirely on the bigger picture... But please trust the hands you're in. Miazaki's vision of success is far from these levels, and he has shown up every single day for eight months, just like I have. As someone who has gotten to know him more personally, believe me when I tell you that he desires success for Kendu more than anyone.

# What role do you play in Kendu?

First, some words of encouragement: You are not helpless. You are more powerful and influential than you can possibly imagine. The most competent among you could take $KENDU to multi-billions even if Miazaki died tomorrow. No one on this blue planet has your specific network, skills, or talents. Think about that. It is only by stepping up to the mark and getting out there that you will bring about the change you want to see in Kendu. If you are unhappy with the price, bring in buyers and join the work. And I don't mean voting on CertiK; I mean doing everything it takes, getting out on the street, building, going down your phonebook, creating a movement, and so on. Dive in with both feet and get involved. If you are dissatisfied with the direction, you can launch successful Kendu products, as many have done, and become a significant and critical cog in the Kendu machine.

The level of success $KENDU aims for will not be achieved through any ""catalyst."" It won't be achieved by CEX listings, endorsements by Elon, anything that Miazaki personally delivers, or him doxxing as Ryoshi and following Kendu from the Ryoshi Twitter. Those things might be welcome boons along the road, but deca-billions and a hundred billion and beyond can *only* be achieved through community activation at a global scale. It can only be achieved when Kendu becomes a movement, and you can be as big or as little of a part of that movement as you want to, but understand that whatever you don't do, someone else has to. That movement is already in its earliest stages; the Kendu community has eleven tattoos, one of which is the words ""Kendu Inu"" crudely tattooed across someone's penis. People are literally jumping out of aeroplanes for Kendu.

So... Become part of it. Activate! Kendu is your canvas; now paint!

You are an autonomous force of nature with all the power in the world. *You need only try*. And you will be supported in your endeavours by an ever-growing army. Kendu will let you do what you've always wanted to do, and whatever you do will instantly be supported worldwide.

# Why should I be bullish when the price has fallen?

There are hundreds of reasons to be bullish on Kendu, including the fact that we have more output, products, and things going on for us than many multi-billion dollar projects, but let's touch on why the price has fallen. Since ATH, we have redistributed 54%+ of the supply from early inactive buyers to over 7000 new active contributors. Multiple wallets with 2%\~ have gotten entirely out of their positions. There is never a quick and painless way to go through something like that; it took months and months of gruelling work. Dips and consolidations are never fun. You feel like you're pushing against a brick wall, you feel like everything you do isn't working, and you feel hopeless. It doesn't matter what the token is; the feeling is always the same. But if you zoom out on the Kendu chart, it looks like a normal and healthy consolidation period.

https://preview.redd.it/bvyyqft3nzvd1.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3d56abe989d5df8a48eaad27bad6b9b42540669

Eventually, the work we are doing will start paying off. Gradually, sellers become less and less of the total daily volume, buying pressure will stay the same or increase, and the price will start moving upwards. Tokens have been transferred from those without conviction to those with conviction. Kendu will be a top memecoin gainer on Dextools/CMC/CG/etc. again and all the brand awareness work we've done for the past few months will kick in because there isn't a soul in DeFi who has yet to hear about us with our level of output. All the money on the sidelines will come in. And with that, we'll begin our next leg upwards with far better distribution, and more active community with higher conviction.

The secret sauce to price action is that there isn't a secret sauce. Any ""catalysts"" are generally only short-lived hype. What we're doing is working; it's just that 54% of the supply understandably has taken a lot of time and effort to overcome. The good news is that when everyone activates and does their best, things start to move in the opposite direction very quickly. *You* are the ""catalyst"" you have been waiting for, and *you* are the person who will bring about the great reversal. The day-to-day doesn't matter. You will laugh at the stress you felt now in the future, and chuckle when the next redistribution period happens and you witness other new community members feeling as you do now. Hopefully, your experience will help guide them through it. Zoom out, focus on your output, and enjoy the earned fruits of your labour when they come. Because we are taking Kendu to the very top, and we absolutely will not stop.

With love,

I do work alot when the times are busy, but it's starting to slow down a bit with the winter approaching and I'd like to make friends with whom I could possibly hang out too.

I enjoy exploring cafes (love a good coffee), dive bars, art galleries and live music. I have a thing for waterfalls and going out to explore the country. 

Low-budget films (with incredible storylines), psycho thriller, biographies capture my attention. I don't read as much as I used to but trying to get back into it. I play soccer a few times a month and have been contemplating climbing. Also, this would be my first white winter and I'm keen beans to try snowboarding.

# Key points

* Copper prices have given back around half of the China stimulus gains, as traders increasingly question the scale and impact of these announcements
* The gold-to-silver ratio has slumped to a 2020 low, as traders weigh growth expectations against general market risk sentiment
* The short-term outlook depends on stimulus news from China, as well as market speculation about the timing, speed, and depth of US rate cuts

Over the past month, a number of economic policy easing measures in China have been announced, primarily through support for the housing market and the banking sector, and, while the initial positive reaction helped drive the Chinese stock market as well as China-dependent commodities such as copper and iron ore sharply higher, more than half of those gains have now been reversed, with traders increasingly questioning the scale and the pace of the announced initiatives. While there has been a clear shift in policy to support a 5% growth target, these rallies increasingly look like dead cat bounces unless fiscal policy shifts more directly to support consumption, which, together with underwater property prices, remain two key factors preventing the Chinese economy from growing at the targeted pace.

The precious and industrial metal sectors have witnessed mixed fortunes this year, with precious metals racing to a 30% gain while industrial metals have returned 8%. However, together with strength in softs like coffee and sugar, these two sectors have supported a year-to-date gain in the Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index of 4%, thereby offsetting losses across oversupplied energy and grains sectors.

The gold-to-copper ratio is a financial metric that reflects the relative strength of gold and copper. In this example, we use LME copper, currently trading around USD 9,450 per ton. It provides insights into various economic conditions, including inflation, growth expectations, and general market risk sentiment. The year-long rally in gold and recent correction in copper have seen the ratio slump to 3.52, a level last seen in 2020 during the pandemic, when copper prices temporarily slumped, and gold received a boost amid stimulus-led inflation concerns.

Prior to that, the ratio was only this weak in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008 when recession and inflation concerns for a short while drove the two metals in opposite directions. Although copper has increasingly become a China demand story, given the fact some 50% of global supply is consumed in China, the falling ratio is nevertheless signalling potential economic distress and a general high level of uncertainty. The latter is supporting gold, given the current focus on fiscal profligacy, safe-havens, geopolitical tensions, de-dollarisation, the US election, and incoming rate cuts lowering the cost of holding bullion for investment purposes.  
  
Based purely on the current direction of travel, the ratio may fall below 3 before finding support, and at unchanged gold or copper prices it would indication a move either in gold to USD 3000 or copper to USD 8000.

https://preview.redd.it/jtwikgqbrzvd1.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=00e458d456dfe646f56646c593d8f015626e2334

Copper prices have gained around 13% so far this year with the bulk of the gains recorded during the first half, when speculators began pre-empting and front run an expected demand pick up supported by China stimulus and the beginning of a US rate cutting cycle. However, a continued rise in exchange-monitored stock levels eventually helped puncture the rally, triggering a price slump in High Grade copper to around USD 4 per pound before bargain buying emerged, only to rally again as the Federal Reserve cut rates and China finally announced a number of stimulus measures.

Having returned to USD 4.30 and the middle of the range seen since June, the short-term outlook for copper will continue to depend on stimulus news from China and as well as market speculation about the timing, pace and depth of future US rate cuts. Our bullish long-term view remains unchanged with solid demand, especially towards the energy transition, potentially creating a shortfall amid miners struggling to increase supply amid higher input prices, lower ore grades, climate change and rising regulatory costs and government intervention. Overall, the uptrend from the 2020 pandemic low looks well established and it would require a weekly close below USD 4 to change that.
