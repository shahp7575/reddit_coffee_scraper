1qicst7,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1qicst7/stop_telling_us_to_give_up_small_joys_to_fix_a/,Stop telling us to give up small joys to fix a broken system.,"Not entirely sure if this fits on this sub but I feel to some extent it does. 

It’s the people that tell you to make sacrifices and get rid of things that cost you money that way you can save.

It's like sure I could get rid of Hulu live, Spotify and morning coffee. But what will that save me? An extra $200 a MONTH. 30 days going without the small things that bring me happiness and at least make working feel worth it, all for $200?

Then they might argue “That’s extra $200 you didn’t have. And when it adds up that’s $2400 a year”

I’m sorry but yes I would take 200 more a month but in the grand scheme of things it’s not life changing. So to take away some things that bring me joy for a whole month just for a small amount of money doesn’t sound like a fair trade. I just feel it’s really tone deaf when people make those remarks.

It’s like I can’t really buy a house just by giving up these things. In fact I could give all this stuff up for decades and STILL not be able to afford a house.

It’s just tiring being told we’re lazy or not willing to make sacrifices when the reality is things are so much tougher now. Also, those people worked ONE job and made it. We have to work TWO or more just to STILL struggle. So how are we lazy or not willing to work?

Online they don’t really differentiate details for the tents vs cabins, so I was hoping maybe someone here has stayed in the cabins and can answer some of my questions:

1. Can I bring food into the cabin? Or is it no food allowed with a bear box outside?

2. Is it warm enough in the winter? Or should I plan to bring a sleeping bag or extra blanket?

3. Can I bring an electric kettle or coffee maker? I know I’ll be out and about before the general store opens.

1qico40,https://v.redd.it/9kopqfenekeg1,Oto's really enjoying my self prepared food.,"They normally are not that quick responsive to the food I provided them ( cucumber, zucchini, bell pepper, nori sheets, algae wafers, protein wafers etc. etc.) In this instance they started grazing rather quickly / near immediatley.

If anyone is wondering here is the recipe I made. I have to admit the goal was to make it more paste-like, that didn't happen because it was my first try.

It is kinda watery and spreads a lot so they are foraging for it as well. So here is the recipe I made: 

# ingredients:

2 teaspoons agar

1 normal sized crushed algae wafers (hikari)

10-20 small sinking wafers containing spirulina,   krill & silkworm(hikari)

2x2 cm piece of nori sheet (random supermarket brand)

4 teaspoons artemia gel juice (dupla)

# preparation: 

put 200ML water to a boil ( I used a kettle)

ground all the dry ingredients ( I used a cheap coffee grinder)

once the water boils pour it in to a cup

add all ingredients 

for the next hour or so stir it every 5 minutes to avoid it all clumping on the bottom.

pour it somewhere flat to cool down further for storage ( I used a freezer bag) 

# feeding + response

Once cooled down I poured 3 teaspoons near the lily pipe exhaust. the otos on the other side of the exhaust started actively foraging rather quickly. 

One teaspoon I dropped down behind the lily pipe exhaust ( location of the video that is filmed) where a group of them usually gathers.

After lights out I checked once quickly with the flash of my phone from the top, they were still actively grazing the area.

1qicm46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianShepherd/comments/1qicm46/at_my_wits_end/,At my wits end,"I love my Aussie so much. She's sweet, friendly, and incredibly smart. Nova is my precious baby, and I would do anything for her.

Immediately when we first took her home, she was trouble. She was an escape artist and we couldnt leave her home alone because she would get out of her kennel and into everything from coffee beans to markers. When she couldn't get out of her kennel, she chewed at it to the point of bleeding, and we would come home to blood spatter all around the kennel. Her trainer gave up, saying that some dogs just can't be kennel trained. Fine. So we dedicated an entire room to her, with toys, a window to the street, and food and water bowls for while we are gone. We never leave her home alone for more than 5 hours (though many of her shenanigans start immediately after we leave), and if we run close to that time, we have a neighbor or friend let her out to use the restroom and play for a while.

She quickly learned how to open drawers and cabinets, so we added child locks. Next it was doors. She learned she could push up the lever style handle and open doors that way. So we switched all of the doorknobs to round ones. Then she learned how to grab and turn round handles. Now we've added an external lock to her room.

We talked to the vet about her issues, and have tried many different anxiety medications (trazodone, gabapentin, and one more that I cannot remember the name of). We got a second dog, thinking maybe if she wasn't alone while we were gone, that might help. The first time we left the puppy in her kennel in Nova's room while we left, Nova opened the door of the kennel the second she heard the garage door close. (We have a camera to crack in on her) We tried a sturdier kennel (ruffland). She ripped the door off of that one. Our other dog is a dachshund mix, and is a notorious house pooper, so we don't want her out. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, my dog is an evil mastermind who keeps outsmarting us at every turn. She gets two hours of walking daily (one hour in the morning and one at night), plus plenty of mental stimulation (training, puzzles, play, etc). 

Is this just par for the course with Australian Shepherds? Is something seriously wrong with the way we're handling her? She's almost 5, is she going to be like this forever? Is she happy? What can we do differently?",1,1768941164.0,AustralianShepherd,1,1.0,False

I’m going to give some context before I dive into it, but I’m just looking to vent and not feel so alone in this situation.

He comes from a very conservative, half jewish family. His mom is in her 50’s, and jewish. His dad is in his early 70’s, not jewish, but very conservative and from Alabama originally. They are very wealthy, I’d consider them socialites as they have a pretty well known social image in the city they live in. My boyfriend is a pilot still accumulating flight hours, and still lives with his parents, which is obviously not a problem in my opinion. His mom is the current (very successful) breadwinner, is a control freak, like in the overly protective boy mom sort of way. She has this idea of how her son’s life should go, and also lives her life in fear of lots of things going wrong. She’s a clean freak, but kind of a hypocrite at the same time. Like she can’t handle candles, flowers, or perfumes because she “can’t handle the fragrance”. Very much an almond mom too about food/health. All natural foods/products, nothing with chemicals that can cause cancer, etc. And into the whole “home remedy” meds vs actual medicine. His dad is just kind of there. He’s older, retired, not quite an alcoholic but drinks more than he needs to at his age too frequently. He also has insane hearing and memory loss, dozing off multiple times throughout the day. He has some very… interesting views on the world, even coming from myself as a moderate open minded independent, and is very judgmental towards anyone that isn’t a white male.

Now I also come from a moderately republican family, both my mom and dad are in their mid 60’s, catholic. I live on my own, with my best friend, hours from my parents. They have come a long way, they’re both open minded loving people, and love me more than anything, even with the context I’m about to give which may shock some. I happen to be a trans woman. I pass very well, I started my transition at 16, and I am kind of the definition of I transitioned simply to blend in and live my life as a female. 99% of people do not know unless they’re told as it is not a personality trait or something I wear on my shoulder. My boyfriend is very okay with this, as he falls somewhere in the realm of being bisexual, and knew from the start of us dating.

When I initially met his parents in March of 2025, I had asked that he tell them about me, for safety and comfort of everyone involved, and he did. We decided to introduce me as a friend first, as we were only 6 months into dating and I am the first person his parents have met knowing I am trans. They loved me. It felt amazing, his mom was open and suggested I stay the night when I visit, as I live an hour and a half from them, so my boyfriend and I could hangout for longer periods of time without either of us doing the drive so frequently, and his dad didn’t mind either. Between March and June of 2025 I’d spend 1-3 nights over at a time, every other week at most, I was taken out to dinners by them, we’d hangout one on one while my boyfriend was at flight school, his mom even offered to take me under her wing with real estate as I’m studying to get my license. I got very personal and told them my entire backstory about my personal journey and my transition in June, his mom also told me her deep life story. She came from a broken family, not so nice area, and how she got up and made this life for herself and her family. (After marrying very rich, chasing her now husband at a country club/golf course even though he didn’t want to date her initially.) Things were genuinely great. Either my boyfriend and I would sleep on the couch and the other in his room, but the more I’d stay over, the more we got close to cracking and telling them. We just wanted to do it correctly so it wasn’t this big betrayal or deceitful event. The last two times I stayed over in June, his parents came into his room to say goodnight, and I’d be in there still in the bed with him, and we’d kind of be cuddling or holding onto each other, and we didn’t try to hide anything. The last night I stayed over, I ended up falling asleep in his room, when his parents came in to say goodnight to us, I was knocked out in his arms asleep on him. I wokeup in his bed, he was already at his flight school, and I walked out to his parents on the couch (I was MORTIFIED) but they acted completely natural and normal, said goodmorning, made me coffee, nothing different. I left later that same day and this is where everythinggggg changed.

We thought we were in the clear because HOW do they not already know at this point. Under the stress of his flight school (ATP) and wanting to just be open and freely together in front of his family, he told them out of the blue without me there. It did not go well. To summarize, his perfect elitist mom was worried about how this would affect him, his image, what this meant for his future, his sexuality, people judging him, dating someone not jewish, this was so unexpected for her somehow, and I don’t live up to the image of their sons girlfriend. His dad is just a lowkey racist, close minded, piece of shit so he couldn’t wrap his head around his son dating a girl with a dick, and  he “could never call or consider (my name) his son’s girlfriend publicly.” I was immediately black balled from their lives.

Since this happened in late June, my boyfriend and I went through some hard moments but stuck it through in the end. He has fought and defended me relentlessly but to almost no avail. In September, I finally saw them again in person, I updated them on my current job training I’m headed to soon (flight attendant) and his mom was boasting about how she’s envious, she always wanted to be one at my age and regrets it everyday, etc. his dad was just kind of meh but they’re nice to my face. They know we are dating now, they know how long we have been, and even though it’s been awhile and their own son has cried to them and called them out on how gross and rude they’re being to someone they said they loved until they knew I was his girlfriend, they still exclude me from everything. My birthday, in September, nothing. Thanksgiving, nothing. Hanukah and Christmas, nothing. My boyfriend and I spent my birthday, Thanksgiving, and Christmas with my family as a result of this. They were surprisingly okay with him coming to my family for the week of the holidays, yet ignore me completely and made plans with my boyfriend for afterwards which I was not invited to.

This is very summarized, I never question myself as a result of my transition as I NEVER deal with rude or transphobic people myself so this is a first for me, and it hits really really hard for me. I’ve cried countless times to him over it. His mom always plans something when we are together and guilts him into attendance without me, holding the financial support and comfort they give him over his head. It’s genuinely gross to him, and so rude to me.

1qicaim,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1qicaim/self_sabotage_vs_listening_to_your_gut/,Self sabotage vs Listening to your gut,"I’m posting because I’m honestly exhausted and could really use outside perspective from people (esp women) who aren’t emotionally involved.

I’m engaged, wedding planned for about 10 months from now. I love my fiancé, he’s kind, emotionally attuned, gentle, and deeply supportive. He was there for me through some really rough patches over the last few years and handled them with so much patience and care. He understands my emotions well, shows up when things are hard, and has been a steady presence in my life. My family loves him, my friends like him, and on paper this is a really good relationship.

And yet… I can’t stop questioning whether I chose the RIGHT person.

Few years ago, I was dating two people casually at the same time (they both knew). I’ll call them D and L. L is my current fiancé. D was someone I had a very strong emotional connection with. He’s charismatic, extroverted, very high-energy, lots of friends, very much a “go-getter.” He came from a more comfortable background and had a lifestyle that felt exciting and expansive. He was also a citizen of the country I’m in, which mattered to me because I’m on a visa and immigration stress has been a constant in my life.

I ultimately chose L because I felt safer with him, was more physically attracted to him, and he felt like someone I could build a life with. Plus he was closer and with D, it would’ve been long distance, which I wasn’t down for. But D visited me often, really put in the effort to see me in person as much as possible, but I really did not want to do something long distance because I didn’t think it was sustainable 

L and I have been together almost four years now. We’ve lived together, planned a future, and gone through genuinely hard life stuff.

But I’ve always had this quiet “what if” in the back of my mind about D, mostly around lifestyle, energy, and a sense of joy and momentum in life.

Recently, D reached out with a casual New Year’s message. He now lives near me. We got coffee. Nothing inappropriate happened, but emotionally it completely threw me. Not because I’m secretly in love with him, but because it brought me back to a version of myself that felt more alive, ambitious, and excited about life when D and I had first met. I have no feelings for him but he just had so many qualities that my fiancé lacks. Like a more active life, he’s not passive, has really pursued his dreams in the past couple years, has an incredible friends circle, well established etc. 

At the same time, L has been struggling. He’s anxious about work, worried about layoffs, on a temporary assignment, dealing with visa uncertainty (like me, so I get it). He also really struggles with being active, exuberant, and socially engaged. I feel like I’m missing a certain joie de vivre in my life, and I know I’m responsible for that too. I’ve tried really hard to bring energy, plan things, build community, create momentum for both of us.

We’ve had many conversations about this. He has tried, genuinely, after multiple talks. But his baseline just isn’t the same as mine …and I can’t fault him for that either. It’s not a lack of effort so much as a difference in temperament and drive.

I was honest with him about the coffee and my doubts. It hurt him deeply. He cried for hours and talked about how lonely and stuck he feels, especially socially. That broke my heart. He’s not defensive or dismissive — he’s reflective and vulnerable. But will he really change these things that I really want in a partner? 

I keep circling the same thoughts. Am I settling for safety? Did I compromise too much of what makes me feel alive? Would life feel lighter or more joyful with someone like D Or am I romanticizing a past connection that was never tested by real life with me?

What scares me most is the idea of being alone and unmoored. Leaving L and then realizing D doesn’t even want me feels unbearable. At the same time, the idea of getting married and always wondering “what if” scares me too.

If L were a bad partner, this would be easy. But he’s not. He’s good. He loves me well. And that makes this decision feel impossible.

Have any of you encountered something like this as women? How do you tell the difference between fear and intuition? Have you ever left a good relationship because something felt missing and did you regret it? Or have you stayed, worked on it, and felt grateful you did?

Please be honest but kind. I’m really tired and trying to make sense of feelings that don’t line up neatly with logic.

Thank you if you read all of this.",0,1768940453.0,TwoXChromosomes,0,0.5,False

Around the time the Panama Papers came out, claims of senior managers seen wheelbarrowing cash out the backdoors of a private bank in Ta’ Xbiex surfaced. The kind of bank that only the truly wealthy used. They knew that the media were on their way to swarm the place and they had confidentiality to protect. 

It was a kind of open secret in Malta, or maybe it wasn’t a secret at all. But the people who ran the country, made and upheld the laws, were some of the biggest criminals among us all. Like Blackbeard and his crew burying their treasures out among the beaches of the Caribbean, they were all tax evaders and money-launderers. If there was no further proof that a change had to come, surely it was in black and white print for all to read. And yet nothing happened. They would call a snap election, and we would just keep electing them back in. 

At the head of the list of miscreants would surely be the Prime Minister and his family. But that was superfluous, they were all in on it. They were playing the Maltese edition of Monopoly and nobody else was invited to the table. But what were we supposed to do? Vote Nationalist? Forget it. 

By the end of summer, I decided I was done with my lawyer. I needed someone new. A person who I figured could make the problem go away. Someone in the know. Someone well loved and respected by those I hated the most. If anyone could fix this, they would. Someone known for changing the laws if it meant sorting out their client, that would end up being the case for me after all. It wasn’t so much of a gamble as it was a sale of the soul. 

It was also around this point I had taken up as much work as I could get. Gradually building consistent fourteen to sixteen hour days. Private lessons, consulting, showing apartments, writing marketing material, and spending the rest of my time enjoying the flow. Partying until the early hours of the morning and going into work a short time thereafter. Hungover, tired, and using only benzos and coffee to keep my nerves steady. It was a wild time.

Resolve seemed round the corner as it always does, that winter we decided to take a trip up to Rome. The whole thing came about over a bitter argument with the girl. God only knows what about. But of course her immediate response was to throw money at the problem and assume it would go away. As we drank red wine while looking out at the moon over the great dome of St. Paul from a friend’s apartment, the issue seemed quelled… for the time. 

Between the intense two days of sightseeing, sandwiched with aperitivi and dinners with old friends, we became exhausted rather than closer. We would bicker on the subway and always be in each other’s faces. Fussing obnoxiously in public places the way you could only get away with in Italy. Naturally, the days ended with intense love making, but the dichotomy of emotions from hour to hour led me to believe that things weren’t as they seemed. 

Ultimately though it was never about Rome, or our squabbling, or about seeing things eye to eye; it was inevitable. Her acid-powered weekly schedule of lawyers and property and estate, contrasted to my starch-collared, benzo driven days of erratically running back and forth across the islands in a way that simply wouldn’t do. Most of all, she was concerned that the small Asian women in my classes were getting a little too googley eyed for her tastes. That my virtue may remain true for not much longer.

 Waving to each other as we went in and out of the courthouse didn’t help either. That would be a major strain on even the most secure relationships.",2,1768940437.0,stories,1,1.0,False

I witnessed my husband's infidelity through surveillance cameras.
It was Paul, my Paul, stumbling into frame with... Lisa? My best friend, my neighbor, the woman I'd confided in over wine and yoga sessions. Lisa was pushing him onto the bed.
How dare they? In my bed, on my sheets, while I was here dealing with a family crisis.
My stomach twisted, a wave of nausea hitting me, but I didn't look away. No, I forced myself to watch, my tears welling up unbidden, hot and silent as they traced paths down my face.
I watched my husband harden under Lisa's touch, his hands roaming her body like it was territory he owned.
""Feel that?"" Lisa purred, nipping his earlobe. ""Your c.um's already spilling out of me."" Paul's response was a deeper thrust, his manhood head battering her inner walls, gravity pulling her down onto him.
My heart pounded, the betrayal sinking deeper with every second. This wasn't just s-ex; it was destruction.
This was the man I'd chosen to build a life with, the one I'd dreamed of forever with—kids, a house that didn't creak with secrets, vacations where we actually talked. But those dreams were crumbling now, pixel by pixel on my screen.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Paul's heart hammered like he'd just sprinted a full rugby pitch, but it wasn't from any game. At 33, with shoulders broad from years of tackles and scrums, he was built like a wall-six-foot-two of muscle that made women stare. But right now, in the dim light of his neighbor Lisa's bedroom, all that power was zeroed in on one thing: betrayal. His wife, Sarah, was just across the backyard fence, probably stirring dinner and glancing at the clock. And here he was, obsessed with Lisa, Sarah's so-called best friend, the one who'd been flirting with him for months under the guise of ""friendly barbecues.""
Lisa was sprawled on her bed, her legs already parted like an invitation he couldn't refuse. She was 28, with curves that hugged her yoga pants like a second skin during their neighborhood runs-full boobs that strained against her tank top, and a smirk that said she knew exactly how to twist the knife. Paul's rugby uniform-grass-stained shorts and jersey from what was supposed to be a quick ""training session""-lay crumpled on the camp bag he'd tossed in the corner, still reeking of sweat and turf. He'd lied to Sarah about extra drills tonight, but this was the real workout.
He climbed over her, his thick manhood already throbbing hard against his boxers, the obsession burning in his veins. ""God, Lisa, I can't stop thinking about this,"" he growled, his voice rough from the field. She laughed, a low, mocking sound that sent a thrill through him.
""Oh, Paul, you know Sarah's too vanilla for a beast like you,"" Lisa purred, her fingers tracing the bulge in his shorts as she mocked his wife with that sharp tongue of hers. ""She's probably at home right now, folding your laundry like a good little housewife, clueless that her bestie's about to get railed by her man. Bet she couldn't handle half of what you're packing.""
Her words fueled the fire, the betrayal twisting into something addictive. Paul yanked her tank top up, exposing her heavy boobs-pert boobs hardening in the cool air. He dove in, sucking hard on one, his tongue swirling around the peak while his teeth grazed just enough to make her gasp. ""God, these are perfect,"" he muttered, switching to the other, lavishing it with wet, hungry pulls that left her arching off the bed. Lisa's hands tangled in his short hair, pulling him closer as she kept up the taunts.
""Mmm, suck 'em like Sarah never lets you. She's always so uptight-probably thinks this is 'dirty.' But you love it, don't you? Obsessed with my boobs while she's waiting like a fool.""
Paul's control snapped. He shoved her legs wider, missionary style, positioning himself between her thighs. Her pu-ssy was already slick, shaved smooth and glistening under the bedside lamp. He freed his manhood-thick, veined, and rock-hard from the buildup-and rubbed the head against her folds, teasing her cherry until she whimpered. ""You're mine tonight,"" he said, voice laced with that dark obsession, before thrusting in deep.
She cried out as he buried himself to the hilt, her tight walls clenching around him like a vice. Paul pounded into her with passionate fury, each stroke slamming home, his hips grinding against hers in a rhythm that echoed his rugby drives-powerful, relentless. The bed creaked under them, her boobs bouncing with every thrust, and he leaned down to capture one papilla again, sucking hard while his manhood pistoned in and out. Lisa's mocks turned to moans, but she didn't let up: ""Screw me harder than you ever f.ck her. She's boring, Paul-I'm the one who makes you come alive.""
Sweat slicked their bodies, his balls slapping against her as$ with wet smacks as he drove deeper, the obsession consuming him. Her pu-ssy gripped him tighter, milking every inch, and he felt her climax building-her nails digging into his back, leaving marks Sarah might question later. ""Come for me, you bimbo,"" he grunted, pounding faster, the betrayal heightening every sensation.
Lisa shattered first, her body convulsing, pu-ssy spasming around his manhood as she screamed his name. That pushed him over-his thrusts turned erratic, and with a final, deep shove, he unloaded inside her. Hot spurts of c.um filled her pu-ssy, creampie overflowing as he kept pumping, marking her with his obsession. She milked him dry, whispering, ""That's it, f.ck yeah.""
Paul slipped out of Lisa's back door under the cover of dusk, his camp bag slung over one shoulder, uniform stuffed inside like evidence of his lie. The ""training"" had dragged on far longer than any real session-two hours of raw, forbidden f.cking that left him drained but buzzing with guilt-tinged adrenaline. Obsession clawed at him; he knew he'd be back for more, betraying Sarah again and again.
Across the fence, his house lights glowed warmly. Sarah paced the kitchen, her phone in hand, worry etching lines on her face. She'd texted him twice already: Training running late? Everything okay? She trusted him, always had-that blind faith made the betrayal cut deeper, fueling his dark fixation.
He pushed open the door, forcing a tired smile. ""Hey, babe. Sorry, coach had us running extra drills. You worried?""
Sarah turned, relief flooding her eyes, oblivious to the scent of Lisa's perfume clinging to his skin. ""Just a little. It's longer than normal-you sure you're alright?""
If only she knew.
Sarah met Lisa the ordinary way, which is how Lisa preferred it. A borrowed cup of sugar. A laugh over the fence. Two women in their twenties and early thirties, both new-ish to the street, both lonely in small, suburban ways. Sarah was warm from the start-open smile, sleeves pushed up, flour on her hands. Lisa clocked it immediately: this one trusts easily.
They slid into friendship fast. Morning walks. Shared wines on the back patio while Paul grilled and pretended not to notice how Lisa always found reasons to lean closer. Sarah talked about routines, recipes, future kids. Lisa listened, asked the right questions, mirrored just enough enthusiasm to look sincere. She was good at that-being what people needed.
Paul was background noise at first. Just Sarah's husband. Big, broad, polite in that distracted way men get when they're used to being admired for their bodies instead of their attention. Lisa noticed anyway. Not lust-not yet-but curiosity. The way his forearms flexed when he carried groceries. The smell of sweat and grass when he came back from training. The way Sarah softened around him, as if her edges only existed for his comfort.
Lisa started coming over more when Paul was home. Not obvious. Never obvious. She'd sit cross-legged on the couch, yoga pants stretched tight, tank tops cut a little lower than necessary. She laughed louder at Paul's jokes than Sarah did. Asked him about rugby, about injuries, about strength-questions Sarah never thought to ask because she already had him.
And Paul noticed. Of course he did.
The obsession grew quietly, like mold behind drywall. Lisa told herself it was harmless-just a thrill, just curiosity. But she watched him differently than she watched other men. She memorized the way his eyes lingered, the way his voice dropped when Sarah left the room. She started timing her runs to match his training schedule, started dressing with intent under the excuse of comfort.
All the while, she played the friend flawlessly.

She helped Sarah pick out anniversary gifts for Paul, all while imagining how his hands would feel on her instead. She listened to Sarah complain about being tired, about routines getting dull, about how Paul was ""sweet but simple."" Lisa nodded, sympathetic, filing every word away like ammunition.
What Sarah never saw was how Lisa looked at Paul when Sarah's back was turned-not hungry exactly, but possessive. Like he was something she'd already decided belonged to her, even before she touched him.
By the time Lisa flirted openly, the groundwork was done. Sarah trusted her. Paul wanted her. And Lisa? Lisa was no longer content to be the friend in the kitchen.
She wanted to be the secret in the bedroom.
And that was always the plan-whether she admitted it to herself or not.
Sarah hummed softly in the kitchen, the kind of absent tune that always made Paul feel like he was coming home to something real, something steady. At 32, she had that effortless grace about her-long auburn hair tied back in a loose ponytail, a simple sundress hugging her slender frame, the one she'd worn when they first started dating. She stirred the pasta sauce with a wooden spoon, the rich aroma of garlic and tomatoes filling the air, mingling with the faint scent of fresh basil she'd clipped from the garden that morning. Paul watched her from the doorway, his broad shoulders slumping a bit under the weight of the day. Or rather, the weight of what he'd done just hours ago.
He truly loved her-God, did he love her. Sarah was his anchor, the one who patched up his bruises after rough games, who laughed at his dumb jokes and made him feel like more than just a slab of muscle on the field. But rugby was brutal, the stress of it piling up like tackles he couldn't shake off. The constant pressure to perform, the aches in his joints, the fear of one bad hit ending it all-that's what he told himself when the guilt gnawed at him. Sometimes, he just needed a release, something raw and unchecked that Sarah's gentle nature couldn't quite match. Lisa... Lisa was that storm, the forbidden rush that let him blow off steam. But it didn't make the betrayal any easier to swallow.
Paul set the table, his movements mechanical, trying to push the memories down. The way Lisa's body had clenched around him, her taunts about Sarah echoing in his ears. He glanced at Sarah, her back to him as she drained the pasta, steam rising like a veil. ""Smells amazing, babe,"" he said, forcing warmth into his voice. ""You always know how to make a rough day better.""
She turned, flashing that bright smile that twisted his gut. ""Rough training again? You looked wiped when you got home. Sit down-it's almost ready."" She plated the spaghetti, twirling it neatly with a fork, adding a sprinkle of parmesan. No questions, no suspicion. Just trust. Paul sat across from her at the small oak table, the one they'd picked out together at that flea market years ago. He reached for her hand, squeezing it lightly, as if that could erase the marks Lisa's nails had left on his back.
They ate in comfortable rhythm at first, forks clinking against plates. Sarah talked about her day at the office, some coworker drama that made her roll her eyes. Paul nodded, half-listening, his mind splintering between the here-and-now and the echo of Lisa's moans. ""Yeah, sounds frustrating,"" he murmured, spearing a meatball. Guilt clawed at him, hot and insistent, like sweat under his collar. He loved Sarah's stories, the way she lit up when she vented. Why couldn't that be enough? Why did he keep chasing that dark edge with Lisa, the one that left him buzzing but hollow?
Mid-bite, his phone buzzed on the table-a sharp, insistent vibration that cut through the domestic hum. Paul's fork paused, his eyes flicking to the screen. A notification from an unknown number, but he knew. Lisa had ways of keeping things discreet, apps that sent one-time pics that vanished after viewing. Sarah was focused on her plate, twirling pasta with that contented look, oblivious. His heart thudded, a mix of dread and that traitorous thrill. He shouldn't look. Not here, not now. But the pull was too strong, the obsession whispering that it was just a glance.
He angled the phone slightly, thumb swiping to unlock it under the table's edge. The image loaded in a flash, high-res and unfiltered, a snapshot from earlier that evening in Lisa's bedroom. There they were, captured in the raw aftermath: Paul's massive manhood still buried deep inside her, the thick shaft glistening with their combined mess, veins bulging from the strain of his final thrusts. C.um overflowed from her stretched cu.nt, thick ropes of it dripping down, coating his pulsating balls in a sticky sheen. Her pu-ssy lips were swollen and parted around him, clutching at his base like they refused to let go, the creamy evidence of his release pooling on the sheets beneath. Lisa's hand was in the frame, fingers splayed possessively over his thigh, her nails digging in just as they had when she'd milked him dry. The angle was perfect-intimate, explicit, showing every detail: the way his heavy balls throbbed with the last pulses, slick and heavy with spillover; the faint red marks on her inner thighs from his grip; the smug curve of her lips just visible at the edge, like she was already plotting the next time.
Paul nearly choked on his spaghetti, a cough building in his throat as heat flooded his face. He slammed the phone face-down, swallowing hard, his manhood twitching involuntarily under the table at the memory. The image burned into his mind, vivid and damning-Lisa's tight heat, the way she'd gasped his name while mocking Sarah's ""vanilla"" ways. Guilt crashed over him like a wave, sharper now, twisting with the fresh arousal. Sarah looked up, concern creasing her brow. ""You okay? Went down the wrong way?""
He forced a laugh, rough and unconvincing, grabbing his water glass to buy time. ""Yeah, just... swallowed funny. Food's great, though."" His mind raced, the picture's details replaying: the c.um-smeared folds of her c.unt, the way his manhood looked enormous, still half-hard inside her, pulsing with aftershocks. He loved Sarah-loved her deeply, the way she made him feel human, not just a beast on the field. But this? This was the release he craved, the stress melting away in those forbidden moments, only to leave him here, guilty and aching.
They finished dinner in strained normalcy, Sarah chatting about weekend plans while Paul nodded, his thoughts splintered. The phone stayed silent, the picture gone forever from the app, but etched in his brain. He cleared the plates, pulling Sarah into a hug from behind as she rinsed dishes, burying his face in her hair to hide the turmoil. ""Love you,"" he murmured, meaning it, even as the obsession whispered promises of more.

Paul Hargrove had always been a force of nature on the rugby pitch, a six-foot-two wall of muscle and determination barreling through opponents like they were made of paper. But off the field, in the bustling streets of Bristol, England, he was something else entirely-a charmer with a grin that could disarm even the most guarded souls. Bristol wasn't just his city; it was his playground, his battleground, and his home. Nestled on the banks of the River Avon, with its historic harborside warehouses turned trendy bars and the Clifton Suspension Bridge arching like a steel rainbow over the gorge, the city pulsed with a raw energy that mirrored Paul's own restless spirit. It was a place where old industrial grit met modern vibrancy: the graffiti-splattered walls of Stokes Croft clashing with the polished facades of the Harbourside developments, where street artists hawked their wares next to upscale cafes serving flat whites to tech workers from the nearby university district.
Paul had grown up in the eastern suburbs of Bristol, in a modest terraced house in Easton, where the air smelled of curry from the multicultural eateries and the distant hum of trains rattling toward London. His father, a former dockworker who'd lost his job when the ports automated in the '90s, had instilled in him a work ethic forged in the city's shipbuilding past. ""Bristol built the world,"" his old man would say, referencing the city's history of explorers like Cabot and engineers like Brunel. But Paul saw it differently; to him, Bristol was a city of hidden corners and endless possibilities, where the steep hills of Clifton challenged your legs as much as a scrum, and the nightlife in the Old City could swallow you whole if you let it.
His friends reflected that eclectic mix. There was Tommy ""The Tank"" Wilkins, a fellow rugby brute from the Bristol Bears team, who'd been with Paul since their school days at the local comprehensive in Fishponds. Tommy was built like a fridge, with a shaved head and tattoos snaking up his arms from his time in the army reserves. He was the loyal type, always up for a pint at The Coronation pub on Gloucester Road, where they'd recount matches over greasy fish and chips, laughing about the time Tommy had accidentally tackled the referee during a heated local derby. Tommy lived in a cramped flat in Montpelier, surrounded by artists and musicians, and he was the one who'd drag Paul to underground gigs at Thekla, the boat-turned-venue floating on the Avon. ""Life's too short for regrets, mate,"" Tommy would say, clinking glasses, oblivious to the double life Paul was starting to carve out.
Then there was Declan O'Shea, the Irish transplant who'd moved to Bristol for university and never left. Declan was the brains of the group, working as a software engineer in the Temple Quarter's tech hub, where gleaming office blocks rose amid the remnants of old railway yards. With his wiry frame, ginger beard, and quick wit, Declan was the one who organized their fantasy rugby leagues and weekend hikes up to the Mendip Hills outside the city. He lived in a shared house in Redland, with its leafy streets and Victorian terraces, and he was perpetually single, chasing skirts at the bars on Whiteladies Road. ""You're a lucky prick with Sarah,"" he'd tease Paul, not knowing the half of it. Declan had been there through Paul's early flings, back when they were all in their twenties, hitting the clubs in Park Street, where the bass thumped through the night and the air was thick with perfume and possibility.
And rounding out the core group was Marcus ""Sparks"" Thompson, the electrician from Southmead, a working-class neighborhood on the city's northern edge known for its tower blocks and community spirit. Sparks was the joker, with a stocky build, a perpetual five-o'clock shadow, and a laugh that could fill a room. He'd met Paul through rugby-Sparks played for a local amateur side-and they bonded over fixing up old cars in Sparks' garage, grease under their nails as they talked about everything from Bristol City football matches to the latest scandals in the tabloids. Sparks was married to his high school sweetheart, Jenny, and they had two kids in a semi-detached house near the Blaise Castle estate, with its sprawling green spaces that felt like an escape from the urban sprawl. ""Family's everything,"" Sparks would say, slapping Paul on the back, making him feel that familiar twinge of guilt even before the affair with Lisa began.
These were Paul's mates, the constants in his life as he navigated the highs and lows of professional rugby. The Bristol Bears trained at Ashton Gate Stadium, a colossal venue in Bedminster that overlooked the river, where the roar of the crowd during home games echoed through the surrounding terraced streets. Paul had joined the team straight out of school, his powerful build-broad shoulders, thick thighs from endless squats, and arms like tree trunks-making him a natural lock forward. The city revered its rugby heroes; fans would spot him in the local Sainsbury's or grabbing a coffee at the Boston Tea Party cafe in Clifton Village, slapping him on the back with cries of ""Good game last week, Hargrove!"" It was a life of bruises and glory, but the stress built up like storm clouds over the Bristol Channel.
That's where Sarah came in. Or rather, that's how she entered his world-like a calm harbor in the midst of his chaotic sea. They met five years ago, in the summer of 2018, during one of those rare Bristol heatwaves where the sun baked the cobblestone streets of the Christmas Steps and everyone flocked to the parks for impromptu barbecues. Paul was 28 then, fresh off a brutal season where the Bears had narrowly missed the playoffs, his body a map of aches and his mind restless for distraction. He'd been out with the lads at a festival in St. Andrews Park, the green expanse in Bishopston alive with food trucks, live music, and families picnicking under the oaks. Tommy had dragged him there after a training session, grass stains still on his shorts, sweat drying on his skin.
Sarah Jenkins was working a stall for a local bakery, her long auburn hair tied back in a loose ponytail that swayed as she handed out samples of fresh scones and pastries. She was 27, slender and graceful, with expressive eyes that crinkled at the corners when she smiled-an open, genuine smile that hit Paul like a tackle he hadn't seen coming. She wore a simple sundress, flour dusting her hands, and there was something effortlessly nurturing about her, like she belonged in one of those cozy cafes on Gloucester Road, not amid the festival chaos. Paul remembered the way her dress hugged her subtle curves, the fabric light against her skin in the heat, stirring a flicker of that predatory drive he kept buried under his charming facade.
He sauntered over, flashing his signature grin, the one that had won him more than a few one-night stands in the bars of King Street. ""Hi, love, those scones look almost as sweet as you,"" he said, leaning on the stall with his muscular arms, his rugby shirt stretched tight over his chest. His voice was deep, laced with that Bristolian lilt-broad vowels and a hint of West Country drawl-that made everything sound playful.
Sarah glanced up, her eyes meeting his with a mix of amusement and wariness. ""Flattery won't get you a free sample,"" she replied, her tone warm but firm, handing him a scone anyway. There was no coyness, just a straightforward grace that intrigued him. She wasn't like the girls he usually chased-the bold ones in tight dresses at the clubs, eager for a fling with a rugby player. Sarah seemed... steady. Anchored.",1,1768940180.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Hey Hyderabad 👋

I’m building an early-stage startup called Moments, it’s a platform for short, premium micro-experiences.
Not rentals, not long bookings.

Think things like:
	•	sunset access on a private rooftop
	•	short luxury car or superbike experiences
	•	aesthetic spaces for quiet coffee / photos

I’m currently onboarding a small, curated set of asset owners in Hyderabad to test this idea. There’s no commitment or cost: just exploring demand.

If you:
	•	own a villa / rooftop / luxury car / superbike
	•	OR know someone who does

I’d really appreciate an intro or a DM.
Happy to explain the idea clearly and transparently.

Thanks 🙏

A little about us:

\-We love going on daily walks so sidewalks and safe areas are important

\-We love to bike in the summer

\-We’re outdoorsy people who enjoy hiking and planning to take snowboarding lessons this winter

\-Food lovers who enjoy trying new restaurants.

\-Date nights often = local breweries/wineries

\-Huge coffee people — we want good local coffee shops nearby

\- We both enjoy strength training at local gyms (not so much big corp style gyms)

\-We’re not Mormon, and we’re curious how that might impact which neighborhoods feel welcoming/comfortable for us

1qic3en,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qic3en,On the Level: The Minnesota Model for Urban Restoration,"One year after the ""Minnesota Model for Urban Restoration"" was initiated, North Minneapolis has become the gold standard for what the administration calls ""The American Restoration."" The chaotic landscape of 2025—marked by entrenched theft rings, a pervasive ""code of silence,"" and the viral ""Church Invasion"" led by Don Lemon—has been 

replaced by a rigorous, high-functioning order. The 1,500 troops that originally stabilized the streets have largely transitioned into a supporting role, acting as the ""Guardians of the Peace"" while a new federal administrative corps oversees the rebuilding of the city's infrastructure. The Somali-run networks that once evaded local law enforcement were dismantled not just through force, but through a total institutional replacement that introduced federal standards for commerce, education, and public safety.

The legal bedrock for this rebirth was the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Minnesota v. United States. In a choice that redefined modern jurisprudence, the Court assigned Justice Sonia Sotomayor to deliver the opinion—a move that effectively signaled a national consensus. Sotomayor’s ruling established the ""Doctrine of Sacred Space,"" declaring that the disruption of the Sunday service at Cities Church was a ""conspiracy against religious exercise"" that local authorities were unable to prevent. This opinion provided the ""Constitutional Shield"" the President needed to bypass state red tape and implement the Model nationwide, prioritizing the safety and re-education of law-abiding citizens. She famously wrote that the government’s primary duty was to ensure the American social floor was, once again, ""on the level.""

Chapter 1: The First Bell

The morning air in North Minneapolis was crisp and, for the first time in thirty years, genuinely still. Marcus stood on his porch, a cup of coffee in hand, watching his fourteen-year-old son, Andre, adjust the collar of his new navy-blue academy uniform. There was no dread in the boy’s eyes—no scanning the street for the ""shadow hierarchy"" that used to rule the block. Instead, Andre was focused on his backpack, which contained the tools for his first day in the Federal Vocational Track for Advanced Robotics.

""Ready, son?"" Marcus asked.

""Yeah, Dad. Mr. Henderson said if I keep my grades up in the Federal Core, I might get a summer apprenticeship at the new Logistics Hub.""

Marcus nodded, a lump forming in his throat. He remembered when this same walk to school was a gauntlet of intimidation, where ""miseducation"" was the norm and the ""code of silence"" was the only law. Now, the neighborhood felt like it belonged to the people again. At the end of the block, a ""Stability Tower""—a sleek, white pillar of AI-integrated sensors—hummed quietly. It wasn't a threat; it was a promise.

As Andre turned to walk toward the Academy, the sight of his son’s straight-backed posture triggered a vivid memory in Marcus—a mental snapshot from 1992. He remembered standing in his father’s carpentry shop, the air thick with the scent of sawdust. His father had pointed to a row of perfectly joined cabinets. ""Marcus,"" he had said, ""the world is built by people who follow the rules and respect the craft. You do it right, or you don't do it at all. Keep it on the level."" But as the 90s bled into the 2000s, Marcus watched that world dissolve. He saw the Somali theft rings and local gangs turn his neighborhood into a place where the loud and the lawless were rewarded. For thirty years, Marcus had felt like a stranger in his own home. Seeing Andre now, heading into a school where discipline and merit were the literal curriculum, Marcus felt the ""Restoration"" clearing the rot from the American soul.

Chapter 2: The Forge of Excellence

The entrance to the North Minneapolis Federal Academy felt like a high-tech guild hall. Andre passed under a bronze plaque: “True Liberty is Found Within the Framework of Law.”

In ""Room 302: Applied Civics and Technical Ethics,"" instructor Mr. Vance—a former Navy Master Chief—stood at the front. He tapped a screen, displaying the new transit bridge over the Mississippi. ""This bridge is being built by the Restoration Corps,"" Vance began. ""It requires math. But more importantly, it requires a team that follows the same standard. In the old system, if you didn't like the rules, you broke them. In this Academy, if you don't follow the rules, the bridge falls. We are bringing this country back to being on the level.""

Andre leaned forward, his stylus ready. He realized he was being taught exactly what his father had been talking about his whole life. He wasn't being taught to be a victim; he was being taught to be an architect.

The transformation was steady. By his junior year, the ""Minnesota Model"" reached fruition. The military presence was replaced by the Academy Guard—senior students and veterans who moved with quiet authority. When a minor theft occurred at a local bodega, it wasn't a ""snitch"" who reported it; it was a student who walked into the precinct and stood tall. The law was no longer an ""outside force""; it was their own.

The Commencement and Placement: June 2029

The graduation was held in ""Restoration Plaza."" Marcus sat in the front row, holding his father’s old wooden carpentry level in his lap like a relic.

""Andre Marcus Vance-Miller,"" the administrator called out. Andre walked across the stage with the measured stride of a professional. As he took his diploma, he received a silver lapel pin: the mark of a Federal Tier-1 Technician.

Two weeks later, at the train station, Marcus handed Andre the old wooden level. ""You’ve got the level, son?""

""I’ve got it, Dad. And I’ve got the standards that come with it."" Andre looked around the clean, efficient station. ""People are calling this the 'Minnesota Miracle.' They want what we have.""

""It wasn't a miracle,"" Marcus replied. ""It was work. And it was you kids deciding the old ways weren't good enough.""

The Era of the Great Consolidation

By the 2030s, the Model was simply the American Way. President Trump’s second term ended with the Restoration complete, succeeded by President JD Vance, the ""Consolidator."" Vance turned emergency measures into permanent civil architecture, replacing the Insurrection Act with the National Vocational Act.

The cultural seal was set when Roseanne Barr, after serving as Vance’s formidable Vice President and head of the ""Bureau of Civic Standards,"" became the first female President of the United States. She ensured the ""miseducation"" of the past never returned, speaking the language of the shop floor to maintain the nation's new foundation.

The Historical Ledger

History books now teach that the ""Great Realignment"" began with a grainy image from 2025: Don Lemon breaching the door of Cities Church. That ""Invasion of the Pew"" provided the moral mandate for the ""Doctrine of Sacred Space.""

The achievements were undeniable:

• The Death of the Code: Neighborhood stability was tied to ""Restoration Credits.""

• The Industrial Rebirth: Cities became the ""Silicon Valleys of Hardware.""

• The Institutional Restoration: Schools taught that ""Rules are the Rails to Freedom.""

As President Barr looked out from the White House, she saw a nation that was finally on the level. In New Detroit, Andre Miller hung his father’s level on his workshop wall. He didn't need it to tell him if his life was straight; the world around him was proof enough. The house had finally been put back in order.

I’ve been searching for the perfect planner, and I can’t find one that seems to have everything I’m looking for. There are some that come close, but not quite. Here’s what I’m looking for:

\-2026 dated

\-Monday start (a preference, not a deal-breaker)

\-weekly and monthly

\-weekly should be horizontal, preferably 2 days per page or something that creates large blocks

\-soft cover, as thin as possible

\-B6 or A5…something like an 8x10 would be ideal (a little bigger or smaller is fine)

\-as thin as possible

\-most importantly: NO LINES! No grids, no dots, no lined areas. I want it as blank and minimalist as possible. 

Contenders:

\-Muji; the dated muji ones look great but they’re sold out

\-Moleskine: this one is also close, but I don’t know, there’s something about the way it feels that I don’t love. (I like their kraft cover notebooks, but the leatheriness of the planner covers feels weird to me)

\-Midori: I have their monthly calendar and love it, but the planner has undated weeks and lots of lines 

\-paper republic: I used to use this one, but the separation of weekly and monthly is annoying, and I want a little more space to write 

\-this one is really lovely, but it’s just a bit small and a bit thick:

So like in their camp in Wyoming, they only have like a few houses(ruins) around so the lack of coffee isn’t insane because there’s just so little supplies.

mesurement? stupid

yandex? idiotic

percentiles? dumb

having a Q angle or bad WHR is MEANINGLESS because passing is not about taking the worst mesurement you have so you can larp being a neverpasser. it's a soup of all your mesurement, mixed in with your face, your presentation, and your look

and this isn't me going ""just get bangs, hon!"" but saying ""ohh but my bithehold is bad"" means NOTHING by itself. saying ""but my proximal fibula is in a 99% percentile!!!"" means nothing because isolating the worst parts is as good as saying ""my ferrari got a coffee stain so it's as good as nothing, look at how bad that tainted carpet is""

yandex is bullshit, and you know it is, because it's not designed with the purpose of saying who you look like the most. it's an image search software, that gives much MUCH more focus on graphical similiarities than your fucking osteology. If you post yourself with makeup, you are EONS more likely to ""match"" with cis women because it's looking for the color palette in the area made by the makeup, NOT FOR YOUR JAW BONE SHAPE; of course at times it can match you with similar pictures based on skeletal structures but that bring my last point

  
EVERY PHOTO IS ANGLEFRAUD

you do not see real life human beings by an angle, you do not see a still image of them, and this includes the cons and the pros. you can never ever take a picture that will accurately imitate a real life comparison because that is NOT HOW SEEING PEOPLE WORKS



a mesurement is not enough. a yandex is not enough. a photo is not enough

you determine if you pass by GOING OUTSIDE and seeing if your appearance PASSES TO PEOPLE. it's litterally that simple

if you go to the grocery store and the cashier says ma'am, YOU PASSED. I don't care what your shoe size was there, YOU PASSED

if you go to the grocery store and the cashiers says sir, YOU DID NOT PASS. I don't care if yandex shows cis girls, YOU DID NOT PASS

stop letting your bdd emotions interfere. take what happens when you go outside, the COLD DARK OBJECTIVE TRUTH and FOLLOW IT

1qibon0,https://i.redd.it/9sv4ayw78keg1.jpeg,Darkness Follows,"Chapter 1: The Funeral

  The day of my father’s funeral was a hot and humid morning, the air seemed to cling to skin like an oppressive weight. I watched as Father Anthony gave his speech, the way sweat poured from his bald head, staining his white robes. His words flew by me, the only thing I could focus on was the casket, immovable, with my dad inside. We probably should have had the funeral indoors but he was the outdoorsy type.

“You gonna let a little heat take away your day? We would’ve killed for days like this in boot camp.”

 I could hear him saying it to me now.

  After what felt like an eternity I looked up and noticed Father Anthony was looking right at me. “Grant, I believe you had some final words to say?” He said. I stood up and wiped the tears and sweat from my eyes, he stepped to the side and I took his place behind the parapet.

“Thank you for coming out today, my family and I appreciate you all for bearing the heat and joining us to honor Dustin D. Jones, Dusty to some, Lieutenant Jones to a few others, and dad to my brother and I… It’s just Eli and me now. But I’m sure Pat is there waiting for his dad to come scoop him up again after all this time. 

My dad, as some of you well know, could be a handful in his own precarious way, a shoulder to lean on when needed, or the hard-headed hermit these last few years. Regardless of how you knew him, one thing about him that everyone knows is how much he loved his family. I’d personally like to consider you all my family today and invite you over to our old home out on Harding Road where we’ll be having the wake. Thank you all again for coming out today.”

I wiped the sweat from my brow and returned to my seat, the shuddering breaths had returned in full force as I collapsed against my brother.

  Father Anthony finished up the service and now it’s time for everyone to come by and pay their respects. My mother, brother, his wife, and I all lined up just opposite the casket as cousins, aunts, uncles, co workers, and a few I didn’t recognize at all, faces that looked lost even there. They all walk by in a blur offering a few words before leaning over the open casket and walking away after they’ve had their fill. The last man to come through was a strange sight in the humid Oklahoma environment, the man was donned in an almost too crisp black suit, black sunglasses that hugged the sides of his incredibly smooth skin, and a black fedora that almost looked stitched atop his head. He was a tall imposing figure, maybe 6’5” and thin as the spaces between a fork’s tines. I craned my neck looking past my family to look at him.

“A coworker of my dad’s maybe?”

My mind was reeling with who this man could be. He offered a stiff handshake to Marley and muttered something too shallow for me to hear. The same could be said for Brandy, my mother. My brother Eli, ever the hugger, reached out with outstretched arms to embrace the man. I watched him step back stiffly, arms raised in protest as he offered a hand in exchange.

“Ah, what the hell man?” Eli exclaimed in a hushed tone. I looked over and saw him cradling his hand like he’d been stung. The man simply leaned over muttering something into Eli’s ear before taking a step over and landing in front of me. 

  “Thank you for coming today, I’m sure my fa—“ 

“You are oldest, correct?” The man cut me off as if I’d never uttered a word. His accent, or lack thereof, immediately stood out. Unable to place it in the moment I assumed that maybe this was an old war buddy from far off but as I looked, actually looked, at the man something else stood out that sent goosebumps down my spine. He wasn’t sweating, he was covered head to toe in the thick black suit but there wasn’t any signs of moisture on him. Normally, I would have been worried he’d have a heat stroke on a day as humid as this.

“Yeah… yeah, I’m the oldest. Why do you ask?”

I waited for him to respond, instead he simply lifted his arm offering a handshake. I looked over to my brother but he had already approached the casket and was, I’m sure, saying his last goodbyes. Tentatively, I raise my hand to his. The man slowly curled his fingers around mine and the only thing colder than the chill I got down my spine was the touch of his flesh against mine. I could feel his grip getting tighter and tighter, with a sudden twist and pull he freed my prosthetic finger from its seating. I let out a sharp breath through my teeth and withdrew my hand.

“Hey, what the hell man?”

I looked up and noticed the man had my finger and was holding it up, no expression on his face, simply inspecting it before letting it roll to his palm and offering it back to me.

“I’ll be expecting you at your dusk. Don’t be late.”

 Chapter 2: Something Lost

  The year was 1995, Dustin had come back from deployment just a year prior and looked forward to settling down. My oldest brother Patrick was four at the time and was not looking forward to having a sibling despite the due date rapidly approaching.

“Hey kid” Dusty said with a grin.

“pull my finger.” Patrick tilted his head to the side and did as his father asked.

He let out an ear-piercing scream as the finger came off sending the unbalanced toddler onto his rear end. 

“Dusty, how many times have I got to tell you not to scare the poor boy?” Brandy popped him on the back of the head with her hand then scooped up the still screaming Patrick from the ground.

“Oh come on Brandy, you’d think by now he’d know it’s a fake.” He wiggled his stub where his index finger should be.

“I’ve only got him with that trick nine thousand times. Seeing as we share the same infliction, you’d figure he’d be over it by now. Alright, you three, dad has to head to work.” He walked toward the pair, gave his wife and son a kiss, and let out a hearty chortle before retrieving the prosthetic finger. He then set off proceeding to the front door slipping on his worn combat boots and heading outside.

Dusty drove down the all too familiar dirt road, each bump and unavoidable pothole made him mutter the same few curses about infrastructure before he hit black top. He pulled into the beige structure rolling his finger around in his palm a few times before stuffing it in his pocket and walking in.

He swung open the doors to the beige, bland building, greeted the receptionist as he does every morning, signed his name on the clipboard, and walked into his office. The grin from home disappeared as he closed the door behind him.

 Chapter 3: Remembrance

 

   “Your dawn,” the man’s voice echoed in my head as I unlocked the door to my fathers house. All those years in the military had ingrained a certain level of cleanliness in my father. The house looked like it always had, clinical, almost sterile. Eli and Marley followed in behind me.

“So who’s watching the kids today?” I asked Marley.

“My mom, we thought it might be a little too much for them. With how fast everything seemed to have happened… i'm not sure they’d understand where their Pawpaw was now.” Eli puts his arm around his wife and gave her shoulder a squeeze.

“It’ll be alright honey, why don’t you go relax for a bit in the living room? Grant and I will set things up in here.” As Marley walked away, I leaned over to Eli in a whisper.

“Have you talked to mom, how’s she holding up?”

“I think she’s already up in bed. I talked to her for a bit before we left the site and… she just doesn’t want to see people down here… celebrating. I think we should just give her some time.”

I nodded my head in agreement and began setting out some finger foods and drinks. Something about the monotony kept my hand busy, it helped.

“Hey… Eli, what was the deal with that last guy who came through?”

“What? You mean Vanilla Icicle? That asshole was probably one of dads clients. You saw, those damn zombies walking around like they were on a field trip. Guy was probably just drugged out of his mind, he damn near took my finger off!”

I wagged the stubby end of my pointer at him. “He got mine.”

Before I could continue there was a light rapping on the door. Marley got up, letting the door open to a small line of guests that had formed outside. I spent most of that late morning talking to various family members, some I’d seen weekly for years, others felt like it had been years.

“Yo, check this out!” I hear an excited boy call out. I cut through a small gathering to find three boys huddled around the front broom closet, which contained my fathers gun safe. The boy who called out, rotating the knob haphazardly.

“Hey, get the hell away from that!” The boys scattered toward the front door, one of the mothers chased close after. I approached the safe, just behind me, my uncle Paul sat in my fathers chair, idly rocking back and forth. He was a bigger guy, with a trucker hat that sat too high on his head.

“Your old man really did turn into quite the re-cluse didn’t he.” Paul muttered out while fidgeting with the blinds.

“So, who’s taking the guns? I could probably get a good price on ‘em for ya. I know you and pretty boy over there ain’t going to do much with them.”

“Can we not talk about this right now?”

“Yeah, yeah alright. You know how to get a hold of me though.” He then stood up and made his way to the kitchen. As he vacated the seat I quickly took his place, I dropped my head into my hands, fighting another wave of tears when out of the corner of my eye, just outside the bent and worn blinds. Movement.

 Chapter 4: False Alarms

  “You going to give the boy something to do, or is this like a bring your kid to work day? All that pencil pushing is making you go soft, Dusty!” Paul called up to the tree stand to Dusty and Patrick, his voice dripping with a mocking tone. 

“If you need his help organizing all your cans, go right ahead and take him.” Dusty retorted, tussling Patrick’s hair.

“You joke about it now but January is right around the corner, don’t come crawling to me when the world goes dark and you aren’t prepared. I’m gonna go grab the truck, Patrick, give your dad a punch for me.”

Paul walked away, rifle slung over his shoulder, laughing at the exchange.

“Dad, how long do we have to stay up here? I’m freezing and Grant is probably breaking all of my toys.” Patrick said with a huff.

“All in good time. I just gotta bag something bigger than your uncle, or I’ll never hear the end of it.” Dusty settled back into the seat surveying the land beneath him.

An hour had gone by before the first signs of life were noticed by the two.

Hearing the crack of a branch, Dusty quickly puts his eye to the scope.

“Shh, we’ve got something Pat.” Dusty whispered.

Patrick leaned forward, squinting his eyes trying to discern anything from the brown and yellow landscape before them.

“Dad, I don’t see anything. Can we just go?” Dusty didn’t respond, too focused on where the snap originated. Another snap made him twist his body to find it, another from the original direction. They kept getting closer. Patrick began tugging on his fathers jacket.

“Not now Patrick!”

The snapping was growing faster. Louder. It seemed to come from all directions now. His heartbeat was a heavy drumming in his ear. Even in the bitter cold weather Dusty had to blink away sweat dripping onto his eyelids, the next snap came from directly beneath the stand. A single word was the last thing Dusty heard before the fall.

“More”

It’s as if someone had pressed their cold lips to his ear and spoke directly into his brain.

 Dusty awoke on the cold, hard, ground. Paul was clinging to Patrick, on his knees. The boy's face held into his chest.

 “Paul, what… what happened?” He rolled over, the pain in his shoulder made him hiss through his teeth. He forced himself to his feet and stumbled over to the two.

“Patrick, Patrick buddy, wake up. Come on kid, get up! Paul, god damnit let him breathe, you're holding him too tight!” Dusty grabbed his brother's arms trying to wrench them free. Paul looked up with tears in his eyes.

“…He’s gone Dusty, I… he’s gone.”

Dusty dropped to his knees and ran his hand through Patrick’s red hair.

The silence in the truck on the way to the hospital was louder than any helicopter or barking drill sergeant Dusty had ever known.

Once they arrived, Dusty carried his son into the emergency room. He knew once the scrubs had the body, he’d have to make the single hardest call he’d ever have to make. The doctors noticed he was nursing his shoulder but he brushed them off, insisting that he was fine. He found his way to a rotary phone mounted on the wall, each twist of the dial felt torturous. As if each number was the pounding of a nail into his son's coffin.

“Hello?” Brandy answered the phone, the cheerful tone in her voice made the news he had to deliver that much harder.

“Brandy… it’s Dustin. Yo—“

“Oh thank god you called! Grant had a little boo-boo, smashed his finger in the door. The poor thing hasn’t stopped crying for over an hour. It’s a little blue bu—“ Dustin cut her off, his voice too harsh and loud in the quiet waiting room.

“Brandy! You need to come to West Memorial Hospital, there’s been… there’s been an accident.”

“Did Paul drop another case of cans on his foot again? I told hi—“ Dustin’s voice cut through before she could finish her thought.

“It’s Patrick.”

Chapter 5: A Price Paid

  After everyone had finally shuffled out of the house I leaned back in the chair, still focused on the figure I had seen through the window. Just a fast flash of black moving along the tree line. I thought back to the encounter with the odd man at the funeral, idly rolling my finger in my palm. I stood up and walked to the kitchen. Eli was hunched over the sink.

“Ah, come to help after all the cleaning is done, huh?” He said. “Why don’t you head down to the basement, mom said there’s some stuff down there she wants us to go through. I’ll probably come look through tomorrow, Marley and I have to go get the kids soon so I’m going to finish up here and head out.”

He stepped away from the sink, tossing a rag over his shoulder as he approached me with outstretched arms. As we hugged, I could feel his shoulders tense.

“Love you man, you get home and hug those kids tight ok?” I said as we both stepped back. Eli wiped a tear from his cheek.

“Love you too brother, I’ll probably be gone by the time you're done down there. Just check on mom before you head out, ok?” I nodded and made my way to the basement door.

 I looked down into the dark pit. It seemed to stretch on for an eternity. I leaned forward, found the drawstring, and pulled. The singular lightbulb flickered before humming to life, casting a weak, yellow glow. At the bottom, a few boxes sat waiting. As I rummaged through, I found some Hot Wheels, baseball cards, and a menagerie of other forgotten things. Before long, I’d rifled through most of them, setting one box aside and tossing a few keepsakes to take home. I squatted on the cold concrete trying to steady myself as a cascade of emotions and memories poured over me. That’s when I noticed another box. This one, set apart from the rest, on the side it read “Patrick”.

I sat down and pulled the box between my legs. Inside were family photos, school crafts, and a few of his toys. At the bottom sat a folder. “Autopsy Report: Patrick Franklin Jones” I steadied myself before slowly opening it.

I scanned over the documents. The external examination matched what I’d been told as I got older. Of course, they noted the missing finger, Patrick lost it when he was four. Mom and dad never told me how. The cause of death was listed as the fall from the tree stand. Reading it sent goosebumps down my arms. The next section confused me 

“expected organ placement was noted to be incomplete. I had to read the words aloud, as if saying them would make them make sense. Then came the list of organs that couldn’t be found: Kidney, bladder, and stomach. No signs of surgical incisions or animal activity. A small scar was noted on the abdomen; the tissue appeared to be thermally altered. Findings are of undetermined origins. I swallowed, my mouth suddenly dry, my head spinning. I closed the folder and set it in the box of keepsakes. I wanted to keep looking but now wasn’t the time. Upstairs, the house was empty. Eli and Marley already gone. I set the box on the table and took a deep breath before going upstairs to check on mom.

I knocked softly. “Hey mom, it’s Grant.” The silence stretched on, the sound echoing through the empty house. Just as I turned to leave.

“Come in.” She said, a slight tremor in her voice.

I opened the door slowly. She was sitting up in bed, a scatter of used tissues spread around her.

I stepped inside, keeping my voice low.

“I just wanted to check on you. I know it’s been a hard day for everyone, is there anything I can do for you?”

“I’ll be just fine, honey. Just seeing you is making me feel much better.” She paused.

“Did you go through the boxes in the basement?”

“Yeah. I grabbed a few things. I think Eli is going to come back tomorrow and go through the rest.” The autopsy report flashed through my mind. There were a hundred questions I wanted to ask, but now wasn’t the time.

“Good… and Grant? She reached out, placing a hand on the empty spot where my father used to sleep.

“Your father wasn’t crazy” She stared at the sheets as she spoke, her fingers tapping lightly against the fabric.”

“I know it probably felt like he shut you out. Like he shut everyone out. But he didn’t do it because he didn’t love you.” Her voice wavered. 

“Something spooked him. I don’t know what it was but things changed after Patrick, not just for your father. For all of us.” She swallowed.

“These last few months… he seemed to be working more than ever. I think if finally caught up to him. He loved you Grant. He loved both of you boys.”

The words emptied her. She collapsed against the pillow, tears soaking into the fabric.

My fingers closed around the doorknob. I was ready to leave. But there was one question I’d been silently dreading since the funeral.

“Mom” I said quietly. “Who was that man today? The tall one. In the black suit.”

Chapter 6: Field Trip

“Happy 10th Anniversary!”

The banner sagged under its own weight, held up by two flimsy strips of tape. As Dusty opened the office door, a chaotic burst of streamers, balloons, and confetti greeted him. Co-workers and clients alike blew into shrill party horns, paper hats cinched too tightly around their heads. One of the higher ups was here today and presented Dusty with a watch.

“For ten years of continued service with the State of Oklahoma and for always lending a hand to those in their hour of need. The division of Protective Services would like to present you with this reward. Woo.” He said blandly.

Daniel, one of the other caseworkers, slipped in behind him, clapping a hand onto Dusty’s bad shoulder and gripping hard.

“Ten years already, huh?” Daniel said. Dusty winced, smiling through clenched teeth. “I guess time flies when you’re working hard.” He cleared his throat.

“Alright, everyone. Thank you but let’s get back to work.” Daniel blew his horn again, the paper coil snapping Dusty in the back of the head. 

“Boo. You’re so boring, Dusty. ‘Look at me, I’m Dustin and I hate fun.’” He put on an exaggerated impression.

“Seriously, man, lighten up. It’s the one morning I don’t have to babysit ten adults who think I invented the toaster.” Dusty shook his head.

“Y’all go ahead. I’ve got paperwork I didn’t finish yesterday.” He headed for his office as Daniel called after him.

“Riiight and Angelina Jolie’s waiting in my office. I’d better hurry.” Daniel stuck out his tongue and made a fart noise as Dusty shut the door. The banner slipped, hanging crooked across the frame. 

Ten years, Dusty thought. He sank into his chair, opened a desk drawer, and dry-swallowed a painkiller before washing it down with a pull from his flask. He spread several folders across the desk, his current caseload. 

Alcoholic. Drug user. Pregnant. Veteran. A few others that were all in the same vein. He leaned back, rubbing his temples.

“Too many liabilities,” he muttered. He stood and stared out the window, eyes fixed on the sky. He didn’t know how long he stood there. He only knew that somewhere on that list was the right choice. The thought settled in him with a sick familiarity. Just like before. He felt it then, the memory of cold, impossibly thin lips brushing his ear. It made his body tense.

Dusty picked up the framed photo of his family and traced a finger along the glass.

Dusty emerged from his office; traces of the celebration still lingered. He walked down the hall to his sector, he gave each of the doors the same sing song knock he used every morning. The first to open their door was Trevor, he closed the door behind him and stood in front of his door at attention.

“At ease soldier.” Dusty said, raising a two finger salute to his forehead.

“Sir, yes sir!” The young man barked back. He’d been there a few weeks by now, a referral from some people at the V.A. he’d been living on the streets for a little over a year before they found him.

Next was Phillip, an older gentleman that had been dropped off, a little too eagerly, by his kids.

“You know, just because I don’t have a hangover doesn’t mean your loud ass mouth don’t still give me a headache. Tell him Mr. Jones, tell him how bad my headaches get!”

“Yeah Saving Private Jackass. Some of us need beauty sleep.” said Lisa. She cradled her stomach, the baby bump small but she made sure everyone knew it was there.

Blane stepped out next, a thin wiry looking kid. He didn’t speak, just shuffled past, hugging himself. A few others stumbled out, faces he hadn’t allowed himself to learn. He’d learned not to get attached long ago. “Alright guys, load up. On the itinerary today we have: Shells, Sears, Blockbuster, and for the finale. Drumroll please.” Trevor enthusiastically drummed on the door behind him. “Walmart. They’re letting me take you guys out for a little treat for my ten years so be on your best behavior, alright?” He turned, jingling the keys in hand as he head outside.

“Woo, fucking Walmart.” Lisa groaned.

The rest of the day went by uneventfully. They got their usual orders of cigarettes, gum, some clothes, and a few movies.

Once they arrived at Walmart, he approached a nearby pay phone. Called home and informed Brandy he’d be attending a party put on by his co-workers to celebrate his ten years with them. He’d be getting a hotel room tonight. He went back to the office after the quick trip to Walmart, everyone was present and accounted for. He turned in his keys, wished everyone good night and left. However, Dustin didn’t go to an office party. He knew that today was not for celebration. He knew, because tonight was the night he had to make that same impossible decision he’d made countless times before.

Night came too fast. Before he knew it, his keys were already in the office door. Confetti crunched under his boots, forgotten by the janitor. He stepped by his office, and now. Now, he looked at those same doors he had just watched everyone turn into for the night.

He knocked lightly and opened the door.

“Wake up.” He said. “We’re going on a field trip.”

“Wake up, shitbirds! Jones isn’t in today, so you’ve got Uncle Danny!” Daniel shouted, banging on doors as he went. “Dude, can you chill?” Lisa groaned from inside her room. “Jesus Christ, you’re worse than soldier boy.”

Phil stepped into the hall, scowling. “I’m telling Mr. Jones about this, Daniel. This is elder abuse. He would never do something like that.” He slammed his door shut, arms crossed, foot tapping. 

Blane and a few of the newer residents shuffled out, quiet. 

“Don’t think you get to sleep in just because your sergeant’s gone,” Lisa said, knocking sharply on Trevor’s door. “Hey. Rise and shine.” No answer. 

Daniel unlocked the door and pushed it open. 

The room was pristine. The bed was made tight, the few belongings neatly arranged. It looked untouched. 

The only thing out of place was a scattering of confetti near the doorway.

“Well? Where is that little shit?” Phil called out.

Daniel whistled. “Huh. Looks like we got a runner.” He thumbed toward Blane. “Surprised it wasn’t Jack Skellington.”

He clapped his hands once.

“Alright, gang. Who’s ready for a little field trip?”

Chapter 7: Echoes

  I closed the door behind me and was finally off to my house. Mom wasn’t much help identifying the man in black in the state she was in. I couldn’t blame her. She did, however, give me my dads work keys, she asked if I could go clear out his office. I would figure that out later. At the time, the sun was dropping lower and I needed to get home to Charles.

After the short ride home, I was greeted by heavy paws on the car door.

“Down Barkley, who's a good boy?” I said, trying to calm the large Pyrenees. I grabbed the box of keepsakes and made my way inside, Charles rushing in behind me. I sat down and opened it up once again, Charles rummaged his nose around the contents as I shooed him away. I laid the folder on my coffee table and slowly fanned out the contents.

“What the hell happened to you Patrick.” I muttered to myself. I braced myself and picked up the pictures from the coroners report, a few close ups of his neck where it had been broken from the fall. His arm was twisted at an unnatural angle, and the last picture.

The last one showed what appeared to be nothing more than a small cauterized-scar on the side of his stomach. I had to clamp a hand over my mouth to stop the rising bile in my chest from coming out when I saw him opened up. By no means am I doctor but, even I could tell. Things were missing, empty voids in his body where something should be. I threw the papers down and ran to the bathroom, emptying my stomach of any contents.

I needed answers, I needed my dad. My hands drifted to my pocket, the office keys. I didn’t know what I would find but I had to look. I stepped outside, filled Charles’ food bowl and made my way to the car.

My hand froze on the handle, Charles bared his teeth, and let out a low growl. He was looking into the tree line behind me. I couldn’t say how long I stared at Charles, my body was gripped with a primal fear. There was no fight or flight, only the feeling of a predator who had already marked its quarry. I only gripped my eyelids shut. There was a faint rustling as if something was moving closer. My heart dropped when I heard Charles' fierce growl turn into a whimper. I heard him run in the opposite direction, something I wish I had the luxury of doing. There, I stood in the deafening silence. Only the faint sound of slow footsteps approaching behind me. The heartbeat in my head transformed into an ear splitting screech when the footsteps stopped directly behind me. There was no breathing, merely the absence of sound itself. Just when I had begun to think it had gone, I felt it. The grip of fingers that were incredibly too long close around my shoulders, palms that could have frozen the sweat pouring down my body, and lizard-like lips that pressed against my burning ears.

“Don’t. Forget.” The voice commanded.

Minutes had gone by before I could move again. I had collapsed onto the floor shaking in the fetal position. The presence had receded right after it spoke but I had a feeling. A feeling of an ever-present eye focused squarely on me. Charles approached slowly, he nudged his head against my back until I rolled over. I looked into the sky, only a handful of hours left of daylight until dusk. I stood up slowly, legs still shaking from the encounter. I gave Charles a hug, then left for my dads office.

“Well looky what we have here. Little Dusty Jr.” Daniel said as he was locking the door behind him. I could smell the aftershave on him from ten feet away and his hairpiece was flapping on top of his head with the wind.

“Come to get your old man’s stuff, huh? Just let Jerry know, I’ve got a hot date so I’ve gotta bounce. Peace!” He raised up two fingers and made a farting noise then made his way to his truck.

“Good to see you too Daniel.” I made my way in. Jerry, the security guard, was asleep behind the receptionist desk. He seemed as ancient now as he did when I was a kid.

I first noticed a few boxes near the door, likely for me to start loading things up. I opened the door and walked in, nothing looked out of place. It was as if he’d walk in right behind me and get started on some paperwork. I went to the desk, family photos, some more Hot Wheels, and other Knick knacks sat on the edge. I began placing the objects in the boxes looking through them as I did. Everything seemed painfully normal. “There has to be something here, come on dad.” I said to myself.

I opened up the top drawer and found his pain killers, some gum, and after moving some things around a half filled flask.

After I found nothing substantial in the desk I turned my attention toward the filing cabinets. As I rifled through the contents I noticed my dad had divided them up into five separate categories: Rehabilitated, Deceased, In Care, Ran Away, and lastly Run Away. The last two made me turn my head in confusion.

“Aren’t those the same thing?” I grabbed the two large piles and stuffed them in a box. Just when I thought I had looked over everything and was about to leave. I noticed something, one of the ceiling panels had a chip in the corner. Big enough to slip your fingers into and shift it. I stood up on the now bare desk and reached up, I moved the panel to the side and hidden above were a few solid sized folders. Grabbing one, I pulled it down and sat behind the desk. I pulled out a random paper to see my dads handwriting.

1qiblr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qiblr4/i_work_as_a_air_traffic_controller_and_the_tower/,I work as a air traffic controller and the tower I work at has special rules,"My name is Daniel Harper, and I’m thirty two years old. I’ve been an air traffic controller at Red Valley Regional Airport for just over three years now, almost all of that on the night shift. It’s not a glamorous job, but it’s a steady one. Long hours, quiet skies, and more coffee than any human being should drink. Most nights nothing happens at all, which is exactly how we like it. Planes land, planes take off, and everyone goes home safe. That’s the whole point of this job—routine. Predictable. Normal.

At least, that’s what I thought before they moved me to the old tower.

⸻

Working at Red Valley Regional was, honestly, boring.

That’s the best way to describe it.

No mysteries. No strange lights. No ghost stories. Just long quiet nights and the occasional late cargo plane lumbering in from somewhere more interesting.

The new tower was spotless. Built in 2004. Modern equipment, clean glass, reliable systems. I’d never had a single weird incident.

So when maintenance called and said the main tower needed structural repairs, I wasn’t worried.

“Just for a couple weeks,” the airport manager told me. “You’ll operate out of the old tower until it’s done.”

I laughed.

“The abandoned one?”

“Abandoned is a strong word,” he said. “It’s… retired.”

⸻

The only part that surprised me was that I wouldn’t be alone.

Normally I worked nights by myself, but because the temporary setup used older equipment, they assigned a second controller to help.

His name was Marcus Reed.

Marcus had been at the airport longer than me, the kind of guy who treated everything like a joke. Loud, sarcastic, and never serious about anything.

“Old tower?” he said when we first met up for the transfer. “Sweet. Maybe it’s haunted.”

He laughed like that was the funniest thing he’d ever heard.

⸻

The old tower sat across the airfield like a forgotten monument.

Rust streaked the metal supports. Windows clouded with age. A narrow concrete stairwell spiraled up the side, exposed to the wind.

The first night we transferred over, facilities handed me a ring of ancient keys and a dusty binder.

“Operational procedures,” they said. “Everything you need.”

Inside was outdated paperwork, faded maps, and at the very back—

A single typed page.

“Supplemental Tower Rules – Old Facility Edition.”

Marcus snorted when he saw it.

“Oh man, spooky secret rules. Let me guess—don’t feed the ghosts?”

I shrugged and skimmed them.

Most were normal.

But a few stood out.

Rule 1

If you receive any transmission on frequency 121.50 after 2:17 a.m., reduce volume to zero and document as interference. Do not reply.

Rule 2

At 3:03 a.m., the runway lights may activate without command. Do not interfere.

Rule 3

Unscheduled radar contacts are to be ignored and not acknowledged on any channel.

Marcus laughed out loud.

“This is amazing. Who wrote this, a paranoid intern?”

“Probably just outdated procedures,” I said.

“Or a bad horror movie script,” he replied.

⸻

The first few nights were normal.

More cramped than the new tower. Colder. Smelled like dust and old paper.

But normal.

Marcus spent most of the time mocking the rules.

“Better not break Rule Whatever or the spooky tower monster will get us,” he’d say.

I ignored him.

⸻

On our fourth night, at exactly 2:17 a.m., the emergency frequency clicked on.

Static.

Then a voice.

“…tower, respond…”

Calm. Weak. Desperate.

I reached for the volume knob.

Marcus leaned over.

“You gonna answer it?”

“No,” I said. “Rule 1.”

He rolled his eyes.

“You actually believe this garbage?”

I turned the volume down.

Marcus didn’t.

He grabbed the microphone.

“Unknown aircraft, this is Red Valley Tower. Say again.”

The voice stopped.

Instantly.

The temperature in the room dropped so fast I could see my breath.

Every screen in the tower flickered.

Then, through the headset, a new voice answered.

Not from the radio.

From directly behind us.

“Thank you for responding.”

Marcus froze.

When we turned around, there was no one there.

He didn’t laugh after that.

⸻

A week in, 3:03 a.m. arrived.

Without warning, the entire airfield lit up.

Marcus grinned nervously.

“Oh, spooky lights time.”

“Don’t touch anything,” I said.

He ignored me.

He flipped the master switch.

Every bulb outside shattered at once.

All of them.

A wave of popping glass rolled across the runway like gunfire.

The tower lights went blood-red.

The radios began broadcasting overlapping voices, hundreds of them, all begging for help at the same time.

Marcus backed away from the panel, pale.

At 3:33, everything went silent again.

The runway lights were intact.

Like nothing had happened.

Except the smell of burned metal never went away.

⸻

Rule 3 got tested soon after.

A radar blip appeared with no call sign.

Marcus didn’t even hesitate.

“Unidentified aircraft, identify yourself.”

The radar screen didn’t just go blank.

It cracked.

A thin spiderweb fracture crawled across the glass.

From the speakers came the sound of something enormous breathing.

Slow.

Wet.

Right outside the tower.

Marcus unplugged the radio with shaking hands.

⸻

The phone was worse.

An old wall phone that wasn’t connected to anything.

Yet it rang.

Marcus finally answered it.

He listened for ten seconds.

Then vomited on the floor.

All he would tell me was:

“It knew my mother’s voice.”

He never explained what that meant.

⸻

There are 73 steps to the tower.

We heard them being climbed every night after that.

But now it wasn’t one set of footsteps.

It was dozens.

Climbing at the same time.

Hands dragging on the railings.

Whispering our names.

Marcus started sleeping in his car before shifts.

⸻

Tonight was supposed to be our last night here.

Repairs finished. Back to the new tower tomorrow.

While killing time, I found the last page of the packet.

Rule 8

If at any time you are transferred back to the new tower, do not return. The new tower is not the same place you left.

Marcus stared at it.

“Yeah, okay,” he said. “I’m not letting a piece of paper run my life.”

⸻

At 2:17 a.m., the emergency frequency turned on again.

Marcus snapped.

“I’m ending this.”

He grabbed the headset.

“Whoever you are, stop messing with us!”

The answer came immediately.

“Rule broken.”

Every door in the tower slammed shut.

The stairwell erupted with footsteps—hundreds of them racing upward.

The windows went black like something was pressed against them from the outside.

Marcus started screaming.

The radio cables wrapped around his wrists by themselves.

The phone rang so loudly it hurt my ears.

Then the door exploded inward.

I saw what came through.

I won’t describe it.

I can’t.

Marcus tried to apologize.

He tried to follow the rules.

But it was too late.

They took him.

Not dragged him away.

They took him apart.

Slowly.

Methodically.

While the radios calmly repeated:

“Consequences. Consequences. Consequences.”

⸻

That was three hours ago.

I’m alone now.

Marcus is still here.

Technically.

The radar shows his call sign circling the airport at 1,500 feet.

The radio keeps using his voice to ask for permission to land.

The phone rings every few minutes.

And the footsteps never stopped.

⸻

The sun is coming up.

My shift ends soon.

But I’m not going back to the new tower.

Rule 8 is the only one left unbroken.

And after seeing what happens when you ignore them…

I’ll follow it for the rest of my life.

⸻

If you ever get assigned to work the old tower at Red Valley Regional…

Read the rules.

Follow them.

Because the consequences aren’t write-ups.

They’re permanent.

⸻

If you want, I can write a sequel where Daniel tries to escape the airport entirely and discovers the rules follow him home.",2,1768938945.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Saysha the beertender and Colton was a patron who also makes homemade hot sauce and he gave us two bottles of it for free! We ate some bites from the Smoking Roux food truck which was okay..the beer at Myriad was very good. Highlight of it was definitely Saysha. Her and my gf just yapped away about crochet while my gf crochet at the bar.

We then departed and went to Haynies Corner Brewing which was very cozy and had good beer as well. Met the brew master(Dan I believe his name was) and ended up shooting darts for the first time in a few years with some patrons. Was very fun.

We then went to Bokeh Lounge and it was karaoke night and it was fun. We had a single cocktail and ordered a salad with grilled chicken, a baked potato, and vegetable beef stew(we topped the potatoe with the stew) it was fucking fire. Very tasty food for that kind of bar.  We then went to our airbnb and slept.


Monday we went to Penny Lane Coffeehouse and gf and I a sandwich and gf got a coffee and met this beautiful patron named Lia who also was into crochet and crafting..we yapped forever. We exchanged info and scheduled to meet up at Turonis off main street for dinner and watch the IU Football game. We then went to a vendors outlet and bought our new friends some small gifts!  Then we went to Damsels and met Summer and Macie(two sweethearts) had some brews and the scotch eggs as a appetizer. I had to try the barrel aged malort..still taste like shit but thr barrel aging actually makes it taste a lil better lol. We then went to Turonis and met up with Lia and the staff was very friendly and we talked with some other patrons as well. Very fun.

It was a great trip and we wanted to hit up pangea or 2nd language but they didnt open til Tuesday and we were full upon waking up Tuesday. We will be back to visit our new friends. ",22,1768938762.0,evansville,3,0.96,False

1qibgb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1qibgb2/does_anyone_know_the_title_of_this_book/,Does anyone know the title of this book,"After the engagement, my sister’s boyfriend dropped a truth—my fiancé and my sister had been secretly seeing each other for three years.
We meet at the diner.I already knew this meeting wasn’t about answers. It was about forcing me to accept the truth.
We sat in silence until I finally asked the question burning through me.
""How long? How long have Serena and Scott been having an affair?"" My words came out calm-almost detached. 
Like I wasn't asking about the man I loved or the sister I'd trusted my whole life. Like it was just someone else's story.
""Three years,"" he said finally. ""Since before you and Scott got back together. Phone records. Hidden messages under fake contact names. Hotel receipts. All carefully spaced - never too close to home.""
The world tilted slightly. The air felt thin.
""Three years,"" I repeated, the words tasting bitter on my tongue. Deep down, I had always known. Scott’s evasive answers. Serena’s sudden silences.
I told myself I was paranoid because believing the lie was easier than losing them both.
We sat there in silence, rain filling the spaces between our breaths. 
Two betrayed hearts, one truth impossible to ignore.
The calm was gone.
And so was the woman they thought they knew.
——————
Meredith's POV
The soft hum of the mall buzzed around us - laughter, footsteps, the muffled chorus of a pop song echoing from the atrium below. Perfume hung in the air, mingling with coffee from the cafe across the way. I'd been here a hundred times, but somehow it felt different today. Maybe because Serena was practically bouncing beside me, arms already full of dresses, acting like she was the one getting engaged.
""Meredith, come on,"" she said, her golden curls bouncing as she turned, flashing her perfect smile. ""Try something with color for once. You can't wear beige to your own engagement dinner.""
I laughed, shaking my head. ""You're getting way ahead of yourself, Serena. Scott hasn't even said anything about a proposal.""
""Not yet,"" James chimed in from behind us, his voice laced with amusement. ""But the guy's been following you around like a lost puppy since senior year. It's about time he made it official.""
He slung an arm around my shoulders as we walked, the easy, protective weight of it both comforting and grounding. I smiled despite myself. ""You two make it sound like I've been waiting around for him.""
Serena gave a dramatic sigh. ""Please. You've been dating him for what, six years? He's perfect, Mer. Stable job, handsome, polite - Mom adores him-""
""Which should've been my first red flag,"" I murmured under my breath.
James barked out a laugh loud enough to draw a few curious glances. ""Careful, little sis. Mom might revoke your golden daughter status if she hears that.""
""Good,"" I said, half-grinning. ""She can give it to you.""
He made a show of adjusting his jacket. ""I'd wear it better anyway.""
We moved through the aisles of the boutique, the soft rustle of fabric and chatter of other shoppers filling the air. Everything sparkled - soft lighting, sequins catching the glow - like a stage set for someone else's dream.
Serena plucked a pale blue dress off the rack and held it against me. ""This one. It's soft, elegant - it screams future fiancee.""
""Or mild depression,"" James muttered.
Serena shot him a glare. ""Ignore him. Try it on. Trust me.""
I took the dress reluctantly. It was exactly the kind of thing Scott would like - refined, timeless, polite. I could already picture his approving nod, the way his hand would rest on my lower back, guiding me through a crowd. Predictable. Steady. Safe.
That word again. Safe.
""Earth to Meredith,"" Serena said, snapping her fingers. ""You're overthinking.""
""I'm not."" But I was.
We'd been together since I was nineteen - through college, family dinners, holidays. He was woven into every piece of my life. But lately, that closeness felt less like comfort and more like a weight pressing into my ribs.
James leaned against a mannequin stand, studying me with that knowing brother look. ""You don't have to rush into anything, you know.""
Serena's eyes darted toward him, surprised. ""James-""
""No, seriously,"" he continued. ""Just because Mom's already planned the engagement party in her head doesn't mean you have to sign up for it.""
I smiled faintly. ""I know.""
He didn't push, and I loved him for that. Serena, on the other hand, was incapable of silence for long.
""Okay,"" she said, her tone bright again, ""existential dread aside - let's play dress-up.""
In the fitting room, I slipped into the dress. It hugged in all the right places, the fabric cool and smooth against my skin. For a second, I saw myself through Serena's eyes - composed, radiant, the kind of woman who had her life perfectly together.
But when I looked closer, I noticed the stiffness in my posture, the hesitation in my own eyes.
It didn't look like joy.
It looked like performance.
""Let's see it!"" Serena called from outside.
I stepped out. She gasped dramatically, hands flying to her chest. ""Oh my God, yes. That's the one.""
James gave a low whistle. ""Okay, I'll admit it. Scott might actually cry when he sees you in that.""
I smiled automatically, though my chest felt tight. Their teasing was harmless - loving, even - but part of me couldn't shake the thought that I was dressing for a life I wasn't sure I wanted.
The sales associate appeared out of nowhere, chirping, ""It's one of our most popular pieces this season. You have wonderful taste.""
""She does,"" Serena said proudly, answering for me.
I turned toward the mirror again. The woman staring back looked flawless - hair pinned, dress fitted, smile effortless. I wondered if anyone else could see the small crack beneath it.
Maybe I just needed new shoes first.
At the register, Serena chatted endlessly about engagement rings and venues while James pulled out his phone, pretending to be bored but keeping an eye on me the whole time.
""You're quiet,"" he said as we left the store, bags swinging from our arms.
""Just tired,"" I lied.
""Right,"" he said, unconvinced. ""You've been 'just tired' a lot lately.""
Serena linked her arm through mine. ""Ignore him. He's allergic to happiness.""
James smirked. ""And she's addicted to denial.""
They started bickering again, their voices overlapping in that familiar sibling rhythm that had filled every family vacation, every car ride, every Sunday dinner.
I tuned them out for a moment, my gaze drifting to a jewelry display across the way - delicate diamond bands glittering under the lights. My chest tightened. Somewhere deep down, I knew the version of myself Scott loved wasn't the one standing here now. He loved the composed version, the one who never faltered. The one who smiled through every dinner, every expectation, every plan that wasn't hers.
And maybe that's who I'd been for so long that even I couldn't tell where the performance ended and I began.
By the time we reached the parking lot, the sun was dipping behind the line of stores, casting long amber shadows across the asphalt. Serena threw her bags into the back seat, humming along to whatever pop song was on the radio.
James leaned against the car, squinting at me. ""You good?""
I nodded. ""Yeah. Just... thinking.""
""Don't think too hard,"" he said gently. ""It'll mess with your head.""
I smiled, small but genuine. ""Since when do you give life advice?""
""Since I figured out you're better at hiding things than Mom thinks.""
The words caught me off guard. For a heartbeat, I didn't breathe. But before I could respond, Serena honked the horn impatiently.
""Come on, you two!"" she shouted through the open window. ""Dinner's not going to wait for us!""
James straightened, giving me one last look - part teasing, part protective. ""Just promise me you won't marry the guy because it's easy.""
I didn't answer.
Because easy wasn't the problem.
Easy was the lie.
Meredith's POV
The car ride home was full of laughter and leftover jokes from the mall. Serena kept insisting I owed her a coffee for ""emotional shopping support,"" and James was arguing that he deserved one too, since he ""didn't complain once through two hours of dress hunting.""
I laughed until my cheeks ached, clutching the shopping bags to my chest as the city lights streamed past the window. It felt good - normal, even. The kind of laughter that came easy when it was just us.
By the time we pulled into the driveway, dusk had folded over the neighborhood. The King house stood tall and immaculate against the fading light - pale stone, wide pillars, trimmed hedges so perfect they looked painted. Every window glowed a soft gold, like a stage set for a family that always looked perfect from the outside.
Inside, it smelled like rosemary and garlic - my dad's cooking. It almost covered the tension that always seemed to hang in the air here, thick and invisible like humidity.
The second we stepped through the front door, that tension snapped into place.
Judith King, our mother stood waiting in the foyer, arms crossed, posture razor-straight. Even at home she looked like she'd stepped out of a magazine - silk blouse, pearls at her throat, not a single hair out of place. The soft lighting did nothing to dull the sharpness in her gaze.
""Do you three have any idea what time it is?""
Serena froze mid-laugh, instantly rearranging her expression into that careful smile that could charm anyone - even our mother. ""Sorry, Mom. We lost track of time at the mall. You know how crowded it gets on Saturdays.""
Mom's eyes softened - just barely - as they flicked over Serena. ""You could have at least called. Your father and I have been waiting for dinner.""
""I tried-"" I started, stepping forward, but her gaze slid past me like I hadn't spoken at all.
""I'm speaking to your sister, Meredith,"" she said smoothly. Her voice was soft, but her words cut all the same - like she'd practiced making disappointment sound elegant.
James shifted beside me, letting out a quiet breath through his nose before walking down the hall. ""I'm starving,"" he muttered, more to himself than anyone. I didn't blame him. When Mom was like this, it was best to disappear.
""I'm sorry,"" I said quietly. ""It was my fault. I should have called.""
She finally looked at me then, one perfectly manicured brow arching as she sighed, like my apology was an inconvenience. ""Yes, you should have."" Then, her attention slid right back to Serena. ""At least you picked something nice for your sister. That blue suits her. Scott will love it.""
The words hit harder than they should have. Of course, it wasn't my choice that mattered - it was that Serena had chosen well for me.
""Thanks, Mom,"" I said anyway, even though my voice came out thinner than I meant.
We followed her toward the dining room, the click of her heels echoing down the marble hallway. The house was spotless, gleaming - the air faintly perfumed with expensive candles and polished wood. Everything was curated to perfection, from the art on the walls to the silver-framed photos of charity galas and award dinners. But it always felt... cold.
The dining room glowed under a chandelier that spilled soft light across the long table. The China was already set, water glasses shining, linen napkins folded into crisp triangles. Dad sat at the head of the table, his sleeves rolled up and a glass of wine in hand. His smile, at least, was real.
""There you are!"" he said as we walked in. ""I was about to send a search party.""
James was already seated beside him, smirking. ""Don't look at me, I told them to hurry.""
Serena laughed and took the seat across from him. ""You loved every second of being dragged through the women's section. Admit it.""
Dad chuckled, serving mashed potatoes onto our plates. ""What did you all do today? Find anything good at the mall?""
""We did,"" Serena said brightly. ""Meredith found a dress. The perfect one.""
I smiled faintly, feeling the heat rise to my cheeks. ""It's nothing fancy-""
Mom cut in before I could finish, her tone sharp enough to slice through the warmth in the room. ""Nothing fancy is right. I still don't understand why you wouldn't pick something more... appropriate for the occasion.""
My fork paused mid-air. ""Appropriate?""
""For your potential engagement,"" she said pointedly, setting down her wine glass with a delicate clink. ""Scott is a wonderful man. You're lucky to have someone like him. I just hope he doesn't realize too late that there are women who would treat him better.""
The air seemed to thin out all at once.
""Mom,"" James said, his voice tight. ""That's not fair.""
Mom barely glanced at him. ""I'm being honest, James. You can't coddle her forever.""
I stared down at my plate, pushing food around I no longer wanted.
""Coddle?"" Serena's voice rose, protective now. ""Mom, Meredith's not a child.""
""I never said she was,"" Mom replied coolly, slicing her chicken with slow precision. ""But she could stand to act a bit more grateful for what she has. Not everyone gets a man like Scott-or the life your father provides.""
Dad's knife hit the plate hard enough to make all of us flinch. His jaw clenched as he looked up at her. ""Judith.""
But she didn't stop.
""All I'm saying,"" she continued, ""is that sometimes Meredith forgets how good she has it. She spends her days chasing ideas instead of responsibilities, and-""
""Enough."" Dad's voice cracked through the air - louder than I'd ever heard it before.
The room fell silent.
Mom's fork froze halfway to her mouth. She blinked, startled, then slowly lowered it back to her plate. ""William-""
""No."" He stood, the chair legs scraping against the floor. ""You don't speak to her like that. Not in this house.""
The clock on the wall ticked - a slow, steady reminder of how long the silence lasted.
Mom's lips thinned. She stood too, straightening her blouse, every movement measured. ""Excuse me,"" she said finally, her voice brittle. She left the table without another word, her heels clicking sharply against the tile until they faded down the hall.
Serena reached across the table, resting her hand over mine. Her skin was warm, grounding. ""Don't listen to her, okay?""
I nodded, but my throat felt tight, my eyes stinging. Dad sat down again with a sigh, rubbing the bridge of his nose. James murmured something to him before the two of them quietly slipped away toward the kitchen, probably to give me space.
Serena stayed for another moment, squeezing my hand before following.
And then I was alone.
Just me, the faint clatter of dishes from the kitchen, and the echo of my mother's voice circling through my mind.
Spoiled. Ungrateful. Forgetting how good I have it.
The chandelier light felt too bright, too sharp against my skin. I stood, pushing my chair back quietly, and slipped away before anyone could stop me.
Upstairs, the hall was silent except for the faint hum of the air conditioning. Family portraits lined the walls - each one a perfect composition of smiles and symmetry. Mom had always insisted on retakes if even one of us blinked. Looking at them now, I wondered how many times we'd faked happiness until it became muscle memory.
My room was at the end of the hall, past Serena's - hers always spotless, lavender scented, sunlight catching on the perfume bottles lining her vanity. Mine was... less curated. Books piled on the nightstand, sketches tucked into drawers, a half-finished candle on the windowsill.
I closed the door behind me, pressing my back to it until the weight in my chest loosened just enough to breathe.
The blue dress hung on the closet door, catching the faint light from the window. For a second, I imagined Scott's face - his easy smile, the way he always said the right thing. The way he fit perfectly into my mother's idea of what a man should be.
And yet... something about it all felt wrong.
I sat on the edge of my bed, tracing the fabric between my fingers. It was soft, expensive, beautiful - everything my mother would approve of. Everything I was supposed to want.
But looking at it, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was getting dressed for someone else's life.
A knock sounded faintly - James, probably - but I didn't move. The door didn't open, and after a moment, the footsteps retreated.
I exhaled shakily, lying back on the bed and staring up at the ceiling.
I could still hear my mother's words, sharp and deliberate, looping through my mind until they settled deep in my chest like stones.
Sometimes Meredith forgets how good she has it.
Maybe she was right. I had everything a person could want - a steady boyfriend, a beautiful home, a family name that opened doors. So why did it all feel so hollow?
I turned my head toward the window. Outside, the garden lights glowed faintly, outlining the rose bushes Dad planted years ago - back when the house had still felt like a home.
My reflection in the glass stared back at me - familiar, but distant. My hair fell loose over my shoulders, my eyes tired. The kind of face that learned how to smile on cue.
For the first time in a long time, I wondered if maybe my mother didn't love me at all.
Or worse - maybe she did, but only the version of me she could control.
The one who wore blue dresses and smiled politely. The one who said thank you when she should have said no.
I turned off the light and lay in the dark, listening to the faint murmur of voices downstairs - Serena soothing, Dad steady, my mother sharp and unyielding. The sounds bled together like static, until eventually, even that faded.
I closed my eyes, but the ache didn't.
Somewhere deep down, I knew that night at dinner wasn't the end of anything.
It was the beginning.
Meredith's POV
I woke to the sound of my own breathing - sharp, uneven, the kind that comes after crying too hard for too long. The pillow beneath my cheek was damp. My throat ached, raw from the quiet sobs I hadn't meant to let escape. For a few seconds, I couldn't even remember where I was. Then the familiar outline of my room came into focus - the soft cream walls, the faint hum of the air vent, the half-open curtains letting in a wash of gray dawn light.
Everything looked normal. And yet, everything felt wrong.
The silence of the house pressed in from all sides - heavy, still, full of things unspoken. Down the hall, I could hear the faint tick of the grandfather clock. No footsteps, no voices. Just the echo of my own heartbeat pounding in my ears.
I sat up slowly, rubbing at my swollen eyes. My reflection in the mirror caught my attention - hair tangled, mascara smudged, eyes hollow. For a moment, I didn't see the woman everyone expected me to be - the polite, composed daughter, the future fiancee. I saw the girl I used to be. The one who could never seem to get it right.
And suddenly, I wasn't twenty-eight anymore.
I was eight.
Flashback
The hallway had smelled faintly of lemon polish and fresh laundry that afternoon. Serena's laughter rang out ahead of me, bright and breathless. ""Run, Mer!"" she squealed, her curls flying as she darted around the corner. Behind us, James was clutching one of Mom's decorative candles - the expensive kind she bought in sets of three and never lit. ""She's going to kill us!"" he hissed, grinning even as he ran.
I followed, my bare feet sliding on the polished floor, my small hands outstretched to steady the candle as he passed it to me. ""Hide it in the pantry!"" Serena whispered, laughing so hard she could barely speak.
But before I could take another step, the candle tipped. Hot wax spilled onto the floor, forming a glistening white puddle that hardened almost instantly.
And that's when I heard her heels.
Mom appeared in the doorway, her presence sharp as lightning. ""What on earth-"" Her eyes fell on the mess, then on the three of us. The silence that followed was suffocating.
""Who did this?""
No one spoke. Serena bit her lip. James looked at the floor.
And then, as if on cue, her eyes found me. ""Meredith. Of course.""
I froze. ""It wasn't-""
""Enough,"" she said, her voice slicing through the air. ""You're old enough to know better.""
My small hands clenched at my sides. I wanted to tell her it wasn't me. That James had taken the candle, that Serena had told me to run. But the words tangled in my throat, useless.
James looked up, guilt flickering in his expression. Serena stayed quiet.
That was how it always went.
I took the blame, and the others stayed untouched.
Flashback - Years Later
Fifteen now. Taller, quieter, better at pretending things didn't bother me.
The kitchen smelled like roasted coffee and citrus cleaner. A perfect report card sat on the counter, edges smoothed out, grades lined in red ink. I'd placed it there deliberately - in plain view, proud but pretending not to be.
Mom glanced at it while pouring herself a glass of Chardonnay. ""That's nice, dear,"" she said absently, her tone clipped, polite, distant.
Just nice.
Not ""I'm proud of you.""
Not ""You worked hard.""
Just nice.
Then Serena walked in wearing a new dress - pale yellow, summer-bright. Judith's eyes lit up. ""Oh, sweetheart,"" she said, smiling wide. ""That color looks beautiful on you.""
And just like that, her warmth was gone from me again, as if I'd imagined it.
I folded the paper quietly, slipped it into a drawer, and told myself it didn't matter. But even now, lying in bed years later, I could still feel the sting - like a bruise that never quite healed.
""Mer?""
The sound of Scott's voice pulled me back to the present. The mattress dipped beside me, and I felt the soft weight of his hand on my shoulder.
I blinked, trying to reorient myself. He looked rumpled, like he hadn't slept either - his dark hair tousled, his T-shirt wrinkled, eyes soft with concern. ""Hey,"" he murmured. ""You were crying in your sleep.""
I sat up a little too fast, my chest tight. ""Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.""
He shook his head. ""You didn't. You scared me, though."" He reached out, brushing a thumb along my cheek. ""You've been holding it in again, haven't you?""
I opened my mouth to deny it, but the words wouldn't come. My throat ached, my vision blurred, and before I could stop myself, I was leaning into him - hiding my face against his chest as the tears came again.
He didn't say anything at first. He just held me. His hand moved slowly up and down my back, his voice a low murmur against my hair. ""It's okay. I've got you. You're safe.""
I let myself breathe - deep, uneven breaths against the soft fabric of his shirt. The smell of cedar and soap clung to him. Comfort. Familiarity. The things I clung to when everything else cracked.
After a while, when the shaking eased, he said quietly, ""James and Serena told me what happened last night.""
Of course they had. My siblings loved me fiercely, but they also loved to fix things - to pass along news like warnings. I swallowed hard. ""They shouldn't have.""
""They're worried about you.""
""I'm fine."" It came out too quickly, too practiced. A reflex.
Scott tilted my chin up, forcing me to meet his eyes. ""You don't have to be fine right now, Mer.""
The kindness in his tone nearly undid me all over again. ""She just-"" My voice cracked. ""I don't know what I did wrong, Scott. I never do. She just... looks at me, and it's like I've already failed her.""
""You didn't do anything wrong,"" he said, steady, certain. ""You never do.""
Something inside me trembled. He always said things like that - things that sounded like promises, like safety. And I wanted to believe him. God, I wanted to believe him.
Scott's hand brushed my hair back from my face, his thumb lingering against my temple. ""Why don't you come stay with me for a few days?"" he said quietly. ""Just until things calm down.""
I hesitated, searching his face. ""Scott, I can't just leave.""
""Yes, you can,"" he said softly, but there was an edge of insistence beneath the warmth. ""You need space from all this. Let me take care of you, okay? Just for a little while.""
Something in me wanted to argue - the dutiful daughter, the peacemaker, the part of me that still thought leaving meant losing. But another part, the one that was tired of crying in silence, just wanted to breathe.
I nodded slowly. ""Okay.""
The morning that followed passed in slow motion. I showered, dressed, and started to pack a small bag. Each movement felt distant, deliberate, like I was watching myself from outside my own body. The sound of rain against the window filled the quiet, soft and steady.
Scott stood by the doorway, arms folded loosely across his chest, saying nothing. He didn't rush me - just watched with that steady patience he always carried, like he knew I needed to move at my own fragile pace.
When I finally zipped the bag closed, he gave a small nod. ""You ready?""
I glanced around my room - the framed photo of Serena and me at the beach, the stack of old sketchbooks, the candle on my nightstand that had burned almost to the wick. So many little pieces of me scattered in this house, pieces I wasn't sure I'd ever get back.
""I think so,"" I said. But my voice didn't sound convinced.
He reached for my bag. ""Then let's go.""
When I came downstairs, my suitcase bumping gently against the steps, Serena was already waiting by the door. Her eyes were red-rimmed like she'd been crying too. ""Are you sure about this?"" she whispered.
I nodded. ""I just need a break.""
She pulled me into a hug, tight and trembling. ""Call me if she says anything, okay? Don't let her make you feel-"" She stopped herself, shaking her head. ""Just call me.""
James stood a few feet back, his hands in his pockets, jaw clenched. He didn't say much - didn't have to. His eyes said enough. He'd always been the quiet protector, the one who absorbed the blowback so the rest of us didn't have to.
Dad came in from the kitchen, his expression drawn but kind. ""You do what's best for you, sweetheart,"" he said softly. ""Always.""
And then there was the empty space - the absence that filled the room heavier than any words could.
Judith wasn't there.
No footsteps. No parting words. No apology, not even a glance from the top of the stairs. Just the echo of her disapproval - silent but suffocating.
I waited for a moment longer, half-hoping she'd appear, that she'd stop me, that she'd say something that would make it all make sense.
But nothing came.
Just stillness.
Just silence.
So I picked up my bag, let Scott take my hand, and stepped out the front door. The air outside was cool, fresh, a soft drizzle misting across the driveway. I looked back once - at the big white house with its polished windows and perfect hedges - the house where everything always looked picture-perfect from the outside.

I've been wondering for years now about some of these random coffee companies offering each some whole product ranges of different roasts and blends as well as some merch, mostly for giving real support for a good cause, or often as well just for the joke.  
So, do each of these companies (for example, AMBM Coffee on Instagram and plenty of others) actually roast and grind their coffee beans, or would they contact one of you coffee roasters and put a wholesale order on both coffee beans and ground coffee, while they would manufacture or order online their packaging ?  
How does all this work ? Thanks a lot for your help and suggestions !

# Chapter XIII

“… *They called our time the Age of Peace. Yet, the very thing our time was named for, proved to be a fleeting, fragile thing, far too often unattainable.*

*Beneath the thick veneer our civilization outwardly displayed, we had strife and loss and a thousand invisible shackles that slowly chipped away at our very souls. Real, genuine moments of peace were rarer than a snowflake in the desert. That was the great paradox of our time and the cold, hard lesson that taught us to appreciate such things that previous generations took for granted…”*

*- From the memoirs of Valyra Thay Rynn*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A handful of wispy clouds rolled lazily over the serene valley below them, allowing the bright, alien stars to cast their light upon the crystalline hull of the shuttle as it sped past the last of the urban sprawl, weaving gracefully around the tall, spindly spires with their impossibly beautiful, delicate looking spun-glass arches. The Alvari shuttle’s hull adjusted its opacity, becoming almost entirely translucent from within the passenger compartment, offering a mesmerizing view of Valion, one which the warlord suspected to be as carefully curated as everything else on that planet, all the way down to every blade of bioluminescent, blue grass framing the banks of the winding river snaking its way towards a distant sea, far beyond the horizon.

Valion was what the humans called a summerworld, a pleasant paradise where people lived happy, easy and comfortable lives, content with what they had and rarely having to worry, *truly* worry about survival, whether their own, or that of their families and friends. There was no bitter frost to kill the crops, no superblizzard to sweep people off their feet or turn chunks of ice into deadly projectiles, no raider to ward off. Life for the commoners here was what the Terrans would consider soft. It was no wonder that the people of such worlds lived such carefree lives, concerned with nothing more than personal fulfillment and the desire for comfort and pleasure, yet Kainan knew that beneath that exterior, lurked a cold and deadly edge.

Had the circumstances been different, the warlord might have stopped to admire that view. He might have felt awe at the sights presented to him, at the beautiful Alvari architecture, with its crystal skyscrapers and floating gardens, at the city districts which seemed grown rather than built, harmoniously blended with the ethereal nature surrounding them. Right now, though, he felt like a fish out of water, suddenly forced to navigate a gilded nest of vipers whose unspoken rules he couldn’t even begin to fathom. Despite the ethereal beauty on display, the warlord knew there was a darker, hidden side to Alvari high society, in which death lurked behind every crystal column and gossamer drapery. He let out a heavy sigh. “Now I know how you felt on Kalidan,” he muttered.

Seated across from him at a socially-appropriate distance, Valyra offered him a small, formal dip of her head, though Kainan could sense the warmth with which she regarded him, despite her outwardly icy demeanor. She was clad in something similar to the one he’d seen her wear when they’d first sparred against each other back on Utopia station, all those months ago. A two-piece outfit consisting of a top that left her midsection exposed and a long skirt that parted into flowing ribbons that seemed to flow in such a way as to match the swaying of those strange willow trees found on Alvari worlds, with shimmering leaves that glowed with a pulsating, violet light. He looked at her lips. He looked at the curve of her neck. He had to force himself to tear his gaze away, for she was breathtaking. And he couldn’t allow his composure to slip, not here, not now.

A faint smile tugged at the corners of her mouth, subtle and fleeting enough that only he could see it. He leaned forward in his seat, resting his hand on the Alvari equivalent of a coffee table that was currently separating them, his gloved fingers sliding closer to her just a hairsbreadth. That was all the warmth their present circumstances permitted them, for anything more would risk revealing secrets that would destroy her fragile-enough standing with the traditionalist faction.

The remainder of the journey passed in formal silence, the shuttle gliding gracefully through the clouds as if carried forth by magic. It did not throb with the roaring of engines or the hissing and clicking of mechanical systems as it passed the last of the valley’s many bends, banking gently in the direction of the great and ancient forest beyond. The warlord might have forgotten it was moving at all, were it not for the view offered by the translucent hull. The soft glow of the bioluminescent trees below them seemed to pulse, as if the forest itself sensed their presence and Kainan could feel an alien awareness brush against the edges of his mind. His psionic defenses, honed by years of hiding, slammed shut in an instant, like a great wall of ferrocrete keeping out the Kalidani blizzards. The princess stifled a chuckle, though her amusement was accompanied by a warning flashing briefly in her iridescent eyes. Where they were going, his every action would be watched and judged.

The forest parted suddenly, revealing a magnificent lake, its waters so still that they reflected the stars above with the clarity of a polished mirror. From its middle, rose an island Kainan might have assumed to be natural, were it not for its perfectly circular shape. The temple at its heart looked less like an artificial edifice and more like an inside-out diamond, its faceted walls pulsating with a soft, inner light. The shuttle descended and a landing platform simply manifested from thin air beneath it, a hardlight projection so advanced as to be completely indistinguishable from physical matter. The warlord suddenly found himself wondering how much of the Alvari architecture he’d seen so far was even made from physical material at all. The crystalline hull of the shuttle suddenly flowed outwards, a section of the bulkhead rolling down and reconfiguring itself into a ramp with a fluidity that reminded him of living tissue.

The procession that filed out of the temple looked like nothing one might see in any Terran religious institution. Where human religions favored sober aesthetics to match the solemnity of their rituals, the Alvari priestesses wore outfits nearly identical to Valyra’s. Flashy, shimmering skirts and tops that left much skin exposed, emphasizing the ethereal grace of the Alvari female form, the iridescent fabrics changing color with each step. The priestesses did not simply walk, they *danced,* each step a carefully choreographed move that followed some silent rhythm he could not hear or feel. It was mesmerizing. It made the hairs stand up on the back of his neck. Watching those priestesses move was like watching a wild whisper cat staking out its territory, for this was no mere courtly dance, it was the *Rinathay*. And Kainan knew just how deadly that Alvari art could be, if those priestesses decided to suddenly reach for the shardblades at their hips.

Suddenly, the priestesses ground to a halt, positioned so as to trace the outline of a willow tree with their formation. Valyra stepped out first, head held high, putting one bare foot in front of the other so that the sway of her hips caused the ribbons of her skirt to flare out around her. She flowed in a way that was both seductive and intimidating, like a feline barring her deadly claws to remind all the smaller cats what their place was. He could sense her reaching into the Veil and her skin lit up with those bioluminescent patterns that were a signature of her species, her mere presence dominating all the other auras around her. The lead priestess, an Alvari woman with auburn hair nearly as long as Valyra’s, dipped her head in approval. Then all the other priestesses silently bowed and knelt. The princess performed a strange, fluid gesture with her hand, palm down, then up and out, as if to pluck an invisible flower and offer it to the sky.

“*Land below, stars above*,” the lead priestess intoned in High Alvari, her eyes downcast, head still bowed in submission. Valyra echoed the greeting and the priestesses rose just as Kainan stepped out of the shuttle, standing slightly to the princess’ right. They regarded him with apprehension and more than a hint of hostility, like one might behold a pet that just walked into the kitchen with muddy feet, tolerated only because he was Valyra’s companion. The warlord refused to be cowed. He drew himself up to his full height, his posture stiff like a coiled spring, taloned fingers flexing at his side as his own psionic echo flared, just briefly. The Alvari might have been the galaxy’s apex predators, but it was good to remind them that they were not the only predators around.

It was hard to tell, but the lead priestess seemed oddly satisfied with his response, just as Kainan predicted. In a gathering of wolves, one did not show weakness, for courage was the only thing they respected. “*The grove welcomes you, daughter of the blood and… ally,*” the priestess intoned in High Alvari. Valyra translated for him, for even though the warlord understood the language, that was a secret both he and the princess agreed to keep concealing. Kainan answered with a curt and formal nod. Another priestess stepped closer to him, her hand held out expectantly. “Ranged weapons are forbidden within these grounds,” the lead priestess explained. The warlord waited for Valyra’s translation, then unstrapped and handed over the pistol holstered on his hip.

The lead priestess then turned on her heel, gesturing for them to follow and just like the shuttle, the walls of the temple shifted and parted, forming an archway as they passed through. Kainan kept his posture stiff and his eyes forward, he would not gawk like a fool no matter how awe-inspiring the beauty of the ethereal edifice, or how impressive the technology powering it, were. The lead priestess introduced herself as Saelithe Vael Lorannis as she led them into a circular chamber where starlight was filtered through a series of lenses from above, so that it fell upon a crystalline bowl of water which seemed to grow from the floor at the room’s center. Saelithe and Valyra both dipped their index and middle fingers into that pool, then raised them first to their hearts, then their lips and finally, their foreheads. Kainan pulled off his glove to mirror the gesture, before the priestess gasped and halted him with a raise of her hand as her eyes fixed upon the metal claws embedded into his fingers. “*The human is tainted!*” she spoke to Valyra, her tone genuinely fearful for the first time since they arrived at the strange temple. “*He can not receive the blessing, not as he is!*” The warlord had to fight back a frown, reminding himself that he wasn’t supposed to understand the Alvari language.

A pair of priestesses suddenly appeared from behind the crystalline columns supporting the chamber’s translucent roof, shardblades already drawn and humming with psionic energy. Kainan tensed, reaching into the Veil as he readied himself for a fight. His eyes flared with a bright, silver color and the temperature in the chamber seemed to suddenly drop by a few degrees, an illusory side effect of the psionic currents swirling around in anticipation of violence. Valyra stepped between them, averting the disaster before it could occur. “*Peace, high priestess!*” the princess cried out. “*I will see to his rite of purification, myself!*” she proclaimed. This seemed to mollify Saelithe and her companions, for they lowered their blades, though they did not sheathe them.

Without pausing to explain, Valyra took his hand and led him deeper into the temple, down a spiraling flight of stairs that opened up to a large, underground chamber that reminded the warlord of a hydroponic garden, illuminated only by the soft bioluminescence of two rows of Alvari willow saplings surrounding a large pool fed by a waterfall from the only natural rock wall of the room. He let out a heavy sigh. He was only here because Valyra needed the favor of the clergy in order to cement her support from the traditionalist faction and for some reason that hadn’t been explained to him, it was important that he accompany her. Well, that and it afforded him a chance to see her, a rare opportunity now that they were on Valion. Unfortunately, he hadn’t even been at the temple for half an hour before somehow nearly causing a diplomatic incident that would have likely ended in orbital bombardment had the princess not intervened.

“Its the Dra’var’th implants,” Valyra explained, sensing his weariness as a set of stone doors slid shut behind them. “Aside from being human, they also brand you as something close to a beast,” she whispered as she reached for the lapels of his coat, prying loose the red sash and the pin with the chains, discarding them on the floor. “You will have to undergo a ritual of cleansing before being allowed to proceed any further,” the princess explained as he undressed and stepped into the water. Valyra joined him, her own clothing discarded into a pile along his. “I am sorry,” she said softly, pressing her hand against his chest, over his heart. “With everything else going on, I forgot to warn you about that.”

The warlord offered her a tired, but comforting smile and reached up to tuck a loose strand of hair behind her elfin ear. She leaned into his touch, covering his hand with her free one, before pulling him gently towards the waterfall. He passed beneath it with her and though he felt nothing, he could tell it held some significance. “The high priestess will want to test your psionics,” she said as soon as they were on the other side, her voice trembling with a hint of concern.

“I’ll manage,” he answered, trying to reassure her despite the apprehension he also felt. He was a formidable fighter in his own right, but without a gun or any other weapon in the middle of an Alvari temple, surrounded by Rinathay bladesingers, he wouldn’t stand much of a chance if the priestesses decided to turn on him. And it was becoming increasingly clear that among the elusive Alvari, everything was some kind of trial.

The princess nodded, flashing him a fierce, loving smile as she took his hand. “Come. We must not linger too long,” she whispered as she led him out of the pool of water. “Leave the coat, the shirt and the boots,” she instructed him as he dressed. Kainan didn’t question her request, he’d learn the reason soon enough.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The first trial was one of endurance. Kainan had to remain perfectly still while the temperature in the solarium he was led to, was lowered to near-freezing and a group of priestesses simultaneously stirred up a telekinetic wind that tried to drain away what little heat his body produced. If he shivered, or so much as blinked, he would be deemed unworthy in the eyes of Alvari society, which could have unpredictable consequences for him and Valyra.

The cold and the wind were horrific and would have broken many a lesser being. Indeed, many Alvari from the lower castes failed this trial and the warlord was shirtless and shoeless, completely exposed. But he was Kalidani. He had been engineered to embody the greatest traits of human genetics and hailed from a world even these priestesses could scarcely comprehend. Compared to the permanent winter and superblizzards of Kalidan, this was a light summer chill.

Standing in the galleries above, Valyra smirked as she watched the looks of utter and complete shock on the priestesses’ features. They were foolish to underestimate human resilience, a trait of their species that she had come to respect and even admire. “The human’s self-control is… impressive,” the high priestess finally conceded. The princess responded by tilting her chin higher, just a fraction.

The second trial was one of the mind. He had to balance a rod on his finger while priestesses telepathically assaulted his thoughts with feelings of rage, helplessness and fear. It was a trial designed to strip his soul bare, to reflect his worst fears back at him, while his task was to maintain perfect concentration. Most Alvari lesser nobles failed this one, for it required an ability to overcome one’s base instincts to a degree very few beings were able to master.

In his mind, he was a boy again, scrambling around on the cold floor of a Dra’var’th gladiatorial arena, while another boy not much older than him stared back with equally terrified eyes. It had been his first fight, a harrowing experience that surpassed even the implantation of those metallic claws, which hadn’t even fully healed yet by that point. He’d hesitated at first. Everyone hesitated at first. The other boy, some Orkyn whose name he never learned, did no such thing. He’d been there longer and had learned the ropes. So, he charged at him with a jagged, half-blunt dagger, trying desperately to run him through.

He’d dodged at the last second, a moment too late and the blade clipped him, drawing a gash across his chest, whose scar he still bore. The fight ended when he sunk his claws into the Orkyn’s neck in a desperate attempt to shove him away. Kainan hadn’t even intended to harm him, he wanted only to get away, to escape the immediate danger, but he had forgotten about those claws. He took his first life without even meaning to.

Most would have broken from being forced to relive such a memory. This was the trial that Valyra worried about the most, for she knew just how painful that memory was for him, had sensed it when he first told her about it, during one of the nights they spent together aboard the Terran flagship. He’d held her gently, her head rested against his chest and she could feel the tension in his muscles despite the tenderness of his hand on her back. Yet, she also sensed his resolve, watched him grit his teeth through the psionic assault, enduring through sheer willpower alone, that iron will to keep going so that others wouldn’t have to suffer the same way he did. She let out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding when the high priestess declared that he’d passed the second trial.

The third trial involved none of the harrowing mind games of the previous two. And this one, she actually looked forward to, though not because she wished to see Kainan tested. She held her hand up, silencing the high priestess before she could speak, a mischievous smirk tugging at the corners of her lips. Valyra reached out towards the wall and summoned a pair of wooden practice blades into her hand. Without bothering with the stairs, she vaulted gracefully over the spun crystal railing of her gallery, landing in a silent crouch on the floor below. She rose slowly, her iridescent eyes glowing with mischief as she slowly circled the warlord. “You know…” she murmured, her voice low, but loud enough to echo across the entire chamber. “It occurred to me that we never actually had the chance to spar properly,” she said as she tossed one of the practice blades to the warlord. Kainan snatched it effortlessly in mid-air. He spun it once in his hand, testing its weight, just as he’d done all those months ago on Utopia Station, then began to circle her in the opposite direction.

“In my culture,” Valyra explained, “there is little difference between a dance and a battle. In Alvari religion, both are expressions of the same thing,” she said, twirling her blade in a way that mirrored his own gesture. “Motion is emotion given form,” she recited that same mantra he’d heard her speak the last time. “Don’t hold back this time,” murmured Valyra, her tone almost seductive, right before she sprang into motion. Without warning, the princess darted forward, closing the distance between them in the blink of an eye, her silken skin alight with bioluminescent patterns as she swung low, then spun around him, the ribbons of her skirt flaring out in a pattern that concealed her movements.

This time, Kainan did *not* hold back. He couldn’t match her speed, or her inhuman grace, so he responded with a telekinetic blast against her barriers, one that launched him backwards and just out of the reach of her practice blade as it swished through the space he’d occupied just a moment earlier. A second blast halted and reversed his momentum, leaning into the strengths of his human genetics, which gave him a slightly higher tolerance for G-forces. He darted towards her, bringing his blade up in a diagonal slash while simultaneously reaching down with his other hand and letting loose another telekinetic wave, intending to sweep her legs out from under her.

The princess parried his practice sword aside with the tip of her blade, a brief slap that deflected his swing inwards and sideways. She launched herself off the floor before his psionic assault could find its mark, sailing through the air and landing in a three-point crouch a few meters away, a wild grin on her features. “Much better,” she said with a smirk, darting forward again before he had the time to recover.

He caught her blade near the hilt of his own, too late realizing his mistake as a psionic blast reverberated through his sword and into his wrist, making his arm tingle with numbness. Had this been a real fight, an attack like that would have shattered every bone in his hand. This was why Alvari blades did not have crossguards, he realized. One was supposed to parry much higher on the blade than how it was done in traditional human techniques, using psionics to redirect the force of an opponent’s attacks out and away from one’s body. Valyra’s grin widened as she watched that train of thought play out on his features in a fraction of a second. He stepped back, twirling his blade again to fight down the numbness in his hand.

He couldn’t match her fighting style and he would never be able to match her prowess with a blade. Discounting her power and skill, he just didn’t have the anatomy to match her fluidity or sense of balance. What he had, was resilience and raw, physical strength. And a penchant for clever, unexpected tricks. He charged in, slamming her blade aside with a telekinetic blast before bringing up his own. She parried his swing and matched his move, the two psionic waves crashing against each other, launching both of them backwards. Again, he reversed his momentum almost instantaneously, this time swinging low at her legs. She vaulted over his blade, but he threw himself backwards before she could exploit the opening. She darted left, then struck right, only to suddenly pounce on him like a cat jumping to catch a bird in mid air, right as he attempted to put some distance between them using a psionic burst to launch himself off the ground. They landed in a heap and rolled across the floor, her long legs locked around his waist. She came up on top of him, straddling him, pinning his sword-arm to his chest and leaning her weight against him, while the tip of her blade came up to rest under his chin. “I win,” she declared with a bright, wild grin.

“Not quite,” he muttered, his own lips twitching in a roguish smirk as he looked down. Her eyes followed his gaze, only to realize his other hand was pressed against her body, just below her chest, taloned fingers splayed outwards. Had this been a real duel, a psionic blast at that distance would have stopped her heart even as her blade slit open his throat. She laughed, a warm, genuine laugh, her eyes bright with mirth as she realized the trick she had fallen for.

“A bold move,” she chimed, fighting back the urge to lean in and kiss him. “Victory at the price of your own life, or mutual defeat.” She rose to her feet, holding out her hand. He took it, not because he needed the assist, but because it was a convenient excuse to keep touching her, if only for a moment longer. He gave her hand a gentle squeeze as he pushed himself upright, the gesture faint enough that no one else would see it before reluctantly letting go. They stood apart, now, both facing the high priestess. The warlord was panting as if he’d run a marathon, his body glistening with sweat from the effort. The princess, by comparison, was perfectly still. She’d only expended a fraction of her psionic power.

“*That was… acceptable,*” the high priestess declared, tapping a finger against the crystal railing of her gallery. “*The human has proven himself a worthy ally… for a Lesser Species, that is,*” Saelithe proclaimed, the disdain in her voice mixing with a hint of grudging respect. Valyra fought the urge to roll her eyes, though she knew the Terrans took no offense at being underestimated in such a manner. In fact, Kainan was more than happy to exploit that kind of error in judgment, as he’d proven several times before.

“*The stars judge him a suitable ally for the Crystal Throne… At least until a better option presents itself,*” spoke the high priestess, an acknowledgment mixed with a veiled threat. The warlord frowned, tilting his chin slightly up as Valyra pretended to translate, his steel gaze boring into the high priestess’ eyes with a silent warning of his own. The Terrans were the House of Wolves, after all. And a wolf never backed down in the face of another predator’s threats.

Location: We spent 3 days in San Ignacio and 4 days on San Pedro. If I had to do it all over again, I'd probably choose to stay on Caye Caulker rather than San Pedro since it's more chill. I have the sense that Placencia would be great and if I get back to Belize, I'll head south next time.

Beaches: I didn't realize before I went that Belize is not really known for it's beaches, at least where we were at. Whether that's due to the the barrier reef or proximity to the equator, I don't know, probably a combo however, snorkeling was fantastic.

The jungle was amazing. Interesting to see what all my pathetic houseplants are supposed to look like in the wild. No-See-Ums were irritating because you don't realize you were bit until days after and they itch forever! I would double up on the bug spray even though you think you may not need it because you don't notice in the moment that something's feeding on you like you would with a mosquito.

We decided on this last trip sort of last minute and I didn't have time to research and plan so I ended up hiring a local guide, **Francisco Junior, from Inland Island Adventures**. I noticed he frequently comments and answers questions on this thread and he seemed to know his stuff so I reached out. I can tell you he is a legit service and he really delivered for us. I wrote a full review on Trip Advisor. Review is titled 'Best Decision of 2026 so far'. I just worked with him direct over **WhatsApp +501 608-0280.**

Here's an excerpt from that review:

Here's what we did:  
San Ignacio was home base. Evenings spent at local recommended restaurants. The lamb curry at Ko-Ox Han Nah (Let's Go Eat) in SI was the best meal I've had in months. Coffee de los Mayas on Burns Ave in downtown SI was good and we drink ours black. We're from Seattle and serious, (but also stupid) when it comes to coffee. Sorry, not sorry...  
Day 1: Xunantunich Mayan Ruins, Belize Zoo,  
Day 2: Cave Tubing,  
Day 3: San Ignacio Saturday market

Day 4-7: Cruised bumpy roads on San Pedro, checked out Secret Beach: Look out for the guys trying to wave you in to parking spots because it's usually to try and drum up business for the dumpier places. The place just to the right of the entrance with the big palapa roof was pretty nice. Hung out in the cigar bar.

Last day was a private snorkeling and boat tour with Roberto from Bradley's Charters, also arranged by Francisco. Roberto was awesome. He's like the Billy Bob Thornton of Belize. Kind of looks like him, slightly mischievous and great DJ. I'll post his contact info later when I unpack and find his card. Anyway, if you're reading this, I hope you enjoy Belize. I sure did and I think that hiring someone local really helped me actually enjoy my vacation.",2,1768937813.0,Belize,1,1.0,False

I have not really ever gotten over her fully. I loved her and ultimately I asked if we could get more serious, but she didn't want to settle down and we broke up. We did only 1 months no contact I think, and then we went for coffee to give our stuff back. We have since been in occasional contact, mostly due to our respective careers. Sometimes I think she is maybe still thinking about me, but out of respect for myself I push that idea out my head. 

I try really hard to not reopen the wound, and move on fully, but she is literally posted in news, sent to my email in event newsletters, and tonnes of people in my city/country share posts about her. I am lower profile, she will see me less. everytime i see her it hurts a little bit.

**1. Content**

Share your proprietary insight or data. Stop publishing what everyone can generate.

As a founder, share a weird bug you fixed last week or a conversation with a customer.

* Data Example: Peter Walker, Head of Insights @ Carta, has 159,221 followers on Linkedin from sharing financial data from Carta in simple infographics.
* Anecdote Example: Chris Pisarski, Co-founder @ Crustdata (YC F24) shares a sales lesson he learned at YC. Relevant to his target audience of tech founders.

**2. Free Tools**

Vibe code a free tool that's useful to your target audience (CLI utilities, calculators, configuration generators) instead of vibe coding content.

It gets word of mouth by providing value and is a great way to capture lead info like email/company info.

* Example: Ahrefs' free SEO mini-tools get users to input their data, analyze metrics, and trust their platform before considering the paid product.

**3. Use Negative Positioning**

Be specific about who you're NOT for.

It can be counter-intuitive, but being violently specific with your messaging helps it resonate and reduces churn. Filtering out bad-fit users early, who will discover dissatisfaction down the road.

* Example: Basecamp explicitly lists features they'll never build and customers they don't want. By saying ""not for big enterprise"" they became heroes for 10-person startups.

**4. Build in Private, not Public**

""Building in Public"" became performance art. With the traditional platforms getting flooded with slop, you have to build the rooms worth being invited into.

Create private Slack/Discord groups with high barriers to entry and create FOMO. Make your customers feel like insiders.

* Example: Figma grew through local designer communities that fostered learning / advocacy. Then entire companies started adopting Figma bottom-up.

**Bonus tip** (you should apply to all 4): Shift from expert to peer.

You earn trust by being real and in the weeds.

Now that everything is perfectly polished with AI, don't be afraid to share what didn't work, an occassional spelling mistake, or maybe even recommend a competitor to a non-ICP.

* Why this works: In 1966, researchers at the University of Texas discovered that highly competent job candidates were deemed more likeable and trustworthy when they ""spilled"" coffee on themselves before the fake interviews. Now called The Pratfall Effect.",2,1768937521.0,ycombinator,3,1.0,False

No real reason.

I wasn’t particularly depressed or didn’t not want to go,

I just thought it would be nice to get two

  extra hours of sleep. 

I am writing this from a coffee shop.

A little Vietnamese place across from the 

  bank and tucked into the corner of a 

  dying mall.

I got a latte and a Xiu Mai, 

Which is kind a chicken sandwich with

  fresh veggies.

The lady behind the counter even gave me

  a entire bottle of sriracha sauce to go 

  with it,

And she drew a little flower in the cream of

  my latte.

It’s a nice place.

I’ll probably come back here.

But this isn’t the first place I went to today.

After leaving my room after putting on 

  about 5 layers of clothing because it’s 

  \-12 with wind chill today, I wandered 

  around aimlessly for a bit and found 

  myself outside the library.

The first thing I noticed upon entering was

  that only about two people were reading 

  a book.

The rest were either on the library 

  computers, or their personal laptops,

  or phones, I even saw one guy playing

  on his Switch.

When I had found a comfortable enough 

  chair I decided to show off my moral

  superiority by pulling out my book from

  my bag and reading it in front of 

  everyone.

After about a chapter on the history of

  the piano I pulled out my phone and 

  scrolled my feed for awhile.

I’m going to have to interrupt my own 

  poem here,

As I just got a refill of latte from the 

  Vietnamese place, as well as a slice of

  chocolate cake.

The cake is terrible.

I just thought you should know that.

Once I had left the library I remembered 

  that I needed more flossers, as I had 

  run out of the pick kind, and I can’t use 

  the string, as I find it too awkward and

  uncomfortable to fit in my mouth.

So I cross the street to go to the drugstore 

But unfortunately I remember too late that  

  I can’t cross the street to go to the 

  drugstore as there is construction on that

  side of the street and suddenly in front of

  my face is a dumpster full of garbage 

  blocking the sidewalk behind a chain link

  fence. 

So I go to cross the street again planning 

  to go around when 

Eureka!

The drugstore has a entrance inside the 

  mall whose own entrance is just around 

  the corner.

So now I’m in the mall.

And I didn’t exaggerate earlier either,

The mall’s dying.

You can feel it in the air the moment you 

  step through the doors,

See it in the shuttered gates of the failed 

  businesses,

Walk it through the nearly empty hallways.

I go to the drugstore,

I buy my flossers,

And then my stomach growls.

I haven’t eaten yet, 

And I see from where I’m standing on the 

  middle floor that on the top there is a 

  sushi place,

Which looks good.

But you know I’m not having sushi.

And now we have come to the part of

  the poem which made me write it in the

  first place.

As I make my way up to the top floor,

The food court,

I see that there are only two restaurants,

  the sushi place and this café,

And that there are only about six people 

  eating there.

And all of them are sitting alone.

Three of them are on their phones,

Two of them are reading books,

And one is just staring off into space,

And I couldn’t sit with them.

I couldn’t sit in that cavernous hall, 

That had far less tables than could 

  comfortably fit in there,

And eat sushi for one with those six 

  strangers. 

And that brings us to the Vietnamese 

  coffee shop. 

I’m nearly done my second cup and 

  terrible slice of cake,

And I’m starting to think that maybe there 

  was a reason that I skipped school today.

I would’ve seen my friends, had fun in my

  class, and gotten a insanely good quality 

  free meal for a college student,

But maybe I couldn’t go to school today.

Maybe sometimes I feel like those six 

  strangers,

They were sitting so close to each other!

They could have talked!

Shared a conversation!

Maybe they had common interests!

Maybe they could’ve formed lifelong 

  friendships,

Maybe they could’ve fallen in love!

But no!

No, 

They ate in silence,

Alone, 

Surrounded by other people,

Who were also alone.

Was that a good meal?

Do you think they will remember it?

Probably not.

I know I’ll remember it.

I wrote an entire damn poem about it.

The dredges of my cup are cold,

  and my cake is gone.

I’m probably going to leave soon.

Maybe watch some TV in my room,

Then hit the gym.

Maybe I should’ve gone to school today.

But I didn’t. 

And maybe I do know why.",1,1768937417.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,0.99,False

1qiatvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1qiatvj/just_needing_to_vent/,Just needing to vent,"Hi all, recently discovered this sub and this may be my safe haven for a little bit. I just need to rant about everything. 

Got told I had a stomach ulcer last spring after vomiting blood a few times but was never properly tested. Just given omeprazole which worked for a bit. Had the occasional stomach ache every now and then but in December I started having bad symptoms again and drs told me it's probably gastritis and gave me omeprazole again. They took a stool sample but idk if they have any results from that yet and I'm due a blood test soon and another docs on Friday now that I've finished the meds and still having issues. 

I know I'm going to get seen again but I just wish I could get seen sooner. Today's actually been okay in terms of discomfort but I'm getting so frustrated with it all. Yesterday and the day before was particularly bad. The nausea, the pain, the extreme discomfort where I can never find a decent sitting position, the bloating. I just want to cry. I slipped a disc in my lower back last year too and while it's healed I get really bad pain if I'm not staying active and recently that's been flaring up too so it's extra difficult to find a comfortable lying or sitting position. I need to stay active for my spine but being too active affects my stomach and nausea. 

I've got a bloated upper stomach too that never goes down and it's making me even more self conscious about my body image. Or it's fat being stored weirdly in my upper belly, I can't really tell. I've been trying to work out (I'm not fat, I'm quite small but have a bit of belly and arm chub) but that's difficult with my stomach pain. 

I'm trying to stick to a healthy diet. Fruit smoothies, chicken, fish and lots of veg. I've cut out alcohol, coffee, spicy foods, fried foods, acidic foods and doing my best with chocolate. If I'm craving it I have small amounts of dark chocolate. Ive been considering going gluten free for a while before this round of gastritis anyways so I'm doing my best to cut that out for a bit too to see if that may help. I love to cook and now it's depressing because I can't cook a lot of my go to meals and have to change how I season things. But it doesn't matter what I eat it barely makes a difference. The other day I did kinda say fuck it and ordered a take away. I barely ate much of course but I'm hurting regardless what I do so I just thought why bother. I find when I eat I'm either not eating enough and still hungry (and when my stomach is feeling empty and rumbling it hurts) or I feel unbelievably full. I can't seem to portion control correctly. One day I only snacked on bell pepper slices and cucumber but it still didn't make a difference. 

I think this came from too much ibuprofen. I have tmjd since 2018 and chronic jaw pain and popping to the point it's affecting my hearing in my ear. Ibuprofen and ibuprofen lysine became my go to for a long time, taking as much as I could in a day for years because the pain with my jaw can be too much and cause a migraine down the entirety of the right side of my face. When I slipped my disc it limited pain relief so all I had was cocodamol and tiger balm. I was also drinking a lot going out and getting smashed about 3-4 nights a week, doing coke, pills, smoking weed, etc, around the time I got first diagnosed with the ulcer but I have since stopped all that last summer, and only having one cider once a month or so when going out, but I haven't drunk anything at all since December when I got diagnosed with gastritis. 

Ive also suffered with an eating disorder in the past where I dropped to just under 80lbs at my lowest, and I'm doing my best to not let this trigger me too much. 

Idk there's not really anything I'm trying to achieve with this post, just rant to a group of people that might understand me. I'm doing my best to change my bad habits and turn my life around but I find I'm getting one health issue after the next and I'm doing my best to not let this all knock me down. Ik a lot of this is on me for past unhealthy behaviours. I don't really have many friends left anymore since I stopped going out as much, I have my boyfriend and he's very supportive but obviously doesn't really understand what I'm going through. I'm going to tell this all to the doctor on Friday anyways but yeah just needed to vent about this all. I've got plenty other life stresses going on too and my health issues seem to be consuming everything. 

If anyone has any helpful advice or even just some encouragement around this all I'd really appreciate

The dynamic between the two kept nagging at me like I had seen it before. Couldn't place it on my first watch but after a few more, I started to wonder if it was like and easter egg. The it came to me.

Hercule Poirot is a detective with a moustache (ala Irving Bailiff) who was very fussy about his eggs. How cute that the writers would place an easter egg inside the egg scene. Not just one reference but two in this case.

He's notoriously picky about his boiled eggs being the same exact size; like the six exact sections of eggs that Helena made with the egg cutter.

[Peter Ustinov's Perot Even Brings His Own Eggs To The Party\*](https://preview.redd.it/5ndjhdhayjeg1.jpg?width=597&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=612f1aaf6d008bf4ab51e2c87acb8fab56cd6a9f)

\*See[ original gif here](https://www.tumblr.com/poirott/166579713127/poirots-and-their-relationship-with-eggs).

But besides that he also becomes ""upset and distressed"" when watching Hastings eat bacon and eggs in Agatha Christie's book The Perils of End House. Just like Jame when looking ill at ease towards Helena not ""taking it raw"".

[Chapter 6:  A Call on Mr. Vyes - in The Perils of End House](https://preview.redd.it/apakpcvrzjeg1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e5126d51cd5cf63082c9d6ceb252c53cf1880d4)

I'm not saying it's definitive that Helena and Irving are allies and it may be a red herring by the writers, but it is convincing to me as an easter egg. 

You might even go one step further when you consider that Gwendoline Christie, one of the actors in the show, has the same  last name as the author of these mysteries. Is Ben Stiller playing games again with names like one of the directors he does an homage to. Is all this it important? Maybe. Is it mysterious? I say yes. ;-)

Also this was created by a 12 year old so don't expect much.



One day, I was drinking coffee when I got a letter, with no address and just a piece of paper saying, 



*Come at 8 P.M. today.*

*Coordinates - N.5894, W.4884*



My hair at the back of my neck went up by looking at the letter. What does this mean? For all I know, I am a good girl who is nice to everybody. 



I tear the letter in half and throw it in the dustbin. This is just rubbish. Possibly a trick to kidnap me.



I pack my bag and go to the office, forgetting about the letter.



The next day, it happens again. But instead of 1 letter, I get 2. I still rip the paper in half.



Next day, again. But this time, 4 letters. This time it read,



*Don’t ignore it. Come at 8 P.M. today.*

*Coordinates - N.5894, W.4884*



Why can’t I ignore it? I rip the paper in half again and throw it. 



In the office, I tell my best friend about it.



“I am getting a letter every day in my home saying to come at 8 P.M at these coordinates or something like that.”



“That is very unusual. Maybe tell the post office to not send these letters.” She has a good point.



I go to the post office and tell them about the letter and ask them not to send it again.



“But we are not sending these letters. And don’t waste my time.” The person replies.



I drive home thinking about that letter. Let’s forget about it. Maybe it will stop the next day.



But the next day, I still get letters. This time, 8. I can’t ignore them. I should go to these coordinates and find out for myself. Maybe I am stupid but I am an adventurous girl. 



I take a knife and pepper spray and drive to these coordinates at 7:34 P.M.



The coordinates are located in a dense forest and no cities around them. Maybe going here is not a good idea. I can turn back. But let’s go. I know self defense.



The coordinates are in a warehouse with a door saying, *Come inside*. My hands start to sweat. I grip the knife strongly in my hand and open the door. It is creaking loudly.



But to my surprise, there was a big sign saying, *Happy Birthday Amy!*, with some of my best friends throwing confetti and a table with a big cake.



“You always celebrate your birthday alone so we thought of surprising you.” Sophia, my oldest best friend says.



While celebrating my birthday, I thank God for giving me the best best friends in the world.

See if you can connect with a local Hudderite colony to buy vegetables/meat/fruits directly from them.

I get whole chickens for $4/piece, $4 for 10lbs of potatoes, and recently they had an over stock of beets and turnips so I got a 20lbs bag of each for only $10 total.  I’ve also purchased beef, pork, coffee, and pre-made sausage.  I’ve never once been disappointed.  

I’m sure it’s not applicable to everyone, but it’s certainly worth looking into.  It’s fresh and good quality produce for very good prices.  The only caveat is they typically sell in large quantities only. 

Southern Alberta had slightly cheaper meat, northern Saskatchewan has cheaper produce (in my personal experience).


Bonus tip: Manitoba had a record breaking crop of potatoes this year and flooded the market.  Many colonies are overstocked on potatoes and selling them CHEAP.  I bought potatoes last year so my prices are from then, but last week we drove out to the colony and they were telling us about this. ",10,1768937041.0,povertyfinancecanada,3,1.0,False

The hard pavement grates against my spine as I squint at the colors twinkling around me. I almost got out of the way in time, as the black sedan veered off the road, onto the sidewalk, taking out street signs and vendor carts barreling towards me, but I wasn’t quite fast enough. Pain exploded through my body as I rolled over the hood and slammed into the sidewalk with a squelching thud. If only I had started that New Year’s resolution 4 months ago to start going to the gym I may have been able to dive out of the way, but probably not. Even if he missed me, I saw his face, and I’m certain this was intentional. 

My breathing slows as my life source leaks from the wounds peppering my body. Bleeding out on the pavement in front of my quant florist shop isn’t how I thought I would die, but the lights are beautiful and my favorite scent of lilys fills my nostrils. 

*One day before.* 

April 22nd. Just another Thursday. I have to finish that order of yellow roses for Mr. Thompson, finalize the inventory for the Pastor’s wedding, and make 8 corsages in various colors for the upcoming Cityview Highschool prom tomorrow night. 

I slowly sip my coffee and look out at the street below from the balcony of my flat, nestled above my cozy floral shop below. Admiring the fog rising off the pavement as the sun rises over the city. I start my mornings before most so only a handful of cars have driven by an otherwise busy street as I enjoy my vanilla macchiato and plan for my day. 

Heading to the door with the dregs of my coffee I step out, lock up, and walk down the stairs to my shop. Entering the door I’m filled with a giddy sense of joy, the joy that comes from being surrounded by my favorite colors and scents, the leafy green, the stark white, deep reds, vivid pinks purples and blues. I head to my workstation and start arranging Mr. Thompson’s 23 yellow roses into a bouquet for his wife. 

He’s swinging by around lunch to pick them up to celebrate his 23rd wedding anniversary. Mr. Thompson runs the bakery down the street and every April for the last 23 years he has ordered yellow roses. One for each year of marriage. I still just charge him for the single yellow rose, even though at this point he’s ordered hundreds, because I idolize love, and hope one day to find what he has. 

As I put the final touches on his bouquet and move towards my desk so I can finalize the invoice for the Pastors wedding to email to them for final sign off, the bell above my door twinkles. 

Stepping through the door into my shop is hands down the most attractive man I have ever seen. He looks like my “book boyfriends” brought to life, and I fully expect wings to sprout from his broad shoulders. He has to duck to enter the doorway and his frame barely fits through in his form fitted navy pinstriped suit. His ice blue eyes meet mine from across my shop and he swoops his jet black hair out of his face. As he saunters towards me I can’t help but appreciate his form, as his suit leaves very little to the imagination, his sculpted muscles - and other…things… - bulging through his well tailored suit. 

“Good morning” I stammer, “welcome to Lillith’s Lilys, how may I help you.” 

“Lillith’s Lilys, that’s an insteresting name” mutters the strange beautiful man. 

“Haha yes, I’m Lillith and my favorite flower is a lily” I giggle. “I’m an aspiring poet and love alliteration, but my first love is flowers.”

“Well, funnily enough Lillith, I’m here to order a dozen Lily’s, as white as fresh fallen snow.”

“Ok sir, can I have a name for the order?”

“Mr. Smith”

“Ok Mr. Smith, I’ll need you to fill out this form including your full name, address, and contact information” as I hand him a clipboard with the form attached and a pen.

“Oh, can we just skip all that, I would prefer to buy them now and pay in cash” tossing the clipboard back onto the counter. 

*Ok, strange, but I have a dozen white lillies already wrapped up. So, maybe? Still need the form though.* 

“Apologies sir, I still need this form filled out for my records.”

“Lillith, I’ll pay double, hell even triple to avoid all this, you hand me those white lillies I see behind you, pay, leave, and we forget this ever happened” he growls slamming $800 on my desk. This is way more than double, hell more than triple what I would normally charge. 

“Ok, sir that’s fine. Here you go Mr. Smith. And apologies for your loss.”

“What the fuck do you mean, my loss” he snarls, his eyes clouding as a shadow crosses over his face. 

Taken aback, I stammer “apologies sir, but white lillies are traditionally a death flower, for funerals. My condolences.”

Angrily snatching the flowers from my hand, Mr Smith storms towards the door. At the last minute he turns and whispers over his shoulder, “it was lovely to meet you Lillith, I’m sure we will see each other again, and who knows maybe I’ll have some white lillies for you.”

Shaken by his comments I lock the door behind him. Pacing around my shop pondering what the actual fuck just happened. Did I just sell flowers to a hit man? Does he have a calling card: what the fuck. I run to my laptop and quickly google murders in the area, stringing the search query with white lillies, and over a dozen unsolved murders pop up, all of them mentioning white lillies strewn across the body. The blood drains from my face as I hear a knock at the door, glancing up, I see Mr. Smith glaring at me, slicing his finger across his throat and mouthing “you’re next.”",4,1768937017.0,nosleep,1,0.83,False

I wake up as a beige appliance,/
plugged into the wall of Tuesday./
No prophecy. No lightning bolt./
Just crumbs in the bed and a song stuck in my throat/
like a lover’s name I never text back./

Everyone said: be extraordinary or die trying,/
so I tried—/
I tried like a drunk philosopher at 2 a.m./
trying to explain God with his shirt half off/
and a lipstick mark that isn’t his girlfriend’s./

But listen—/
my life doesn’t climax in fireworks./
It sighs./
It makes that soft, indecent sound/
of socks hitting the floor/
when nobody’s watching./

I am not the chosen one./
I’m the one who shows up late,/
orders water,/
and still feels full./

I’ve fucked ambition behind a bar once—/
it was sloppy, loud,/
kept calling me “baby” like it meant destiny./
Afterward, it stole my lighter/
and said we’d definitely do this again./
We did not./

Now I sit with my ordinariness/
like it’s a warm body beside me—/
breathing, flawed,/
occasionally stealing the covers./
And I think:/
this is enough plot for one lifetime./

I don’t need to be immortal./
I just want to be awake./
To laugh at my own jokes./
To touch something real./
To stop auditioning for heaven/
and live in this messy, horny,/
beautiful middle verse./

History can keep its crowns./
I’ll take my coffee lukewarm,/
my name misspelled,/
my heart intact but unremarkable./

I am ordinary./
I decide it’s enough./
And for the first time—/
nothing argues back./

Been together 13 years and I feel like ever since we had our first daughter he hasn’t “Tried” anymore. I feel like most men get the idea of once they have a women they don’t need to no longer try or put any effort into the relationship. 

He works 6days a week 12hr shift. We husy had a 2nd baby which she’s 8 months old and the other she is 12y. I understand he’s tired works a lot and wants some rest. But I feel like he also needs to invest time into his relationship. It makes me so sad and lonely. I shouldn’t feel like this when I have a partner. I feel like I’m constantly alone, he doesn’t care, and doesn’t love me or want to be with me. 

His days off we can go on a date or maybe eat with the kids which is rare some days. But most of the time he ignores me. Doesn’t plan a date or anything for us to “bond” yes we have sex but only because it’s just “there” it’s easy for us because we have needs. But I would like to be intimate on another level making love and feeling loved. Building our connection. Making the relationship stronger. The sex is never bad it’s great. He always takes care of me first before himself. But I just feel like it’s forced. I want to bond and build.  Since I don’t feel loved it just pushes me away to seek male validation and I can get it and get it. I know it’s not okay but I am missing something inside me, I piece of loneliness and feeling alone and broken. It feels good at the moment when a male gives it to me. My ego feeds off of it. It fulfills what I’m missing (at the moment) then later on in the day it goes away that feeling a male that’s not my partner gave to me. And I start to feel sad and lonely again. Wishing that validation and fulfillment was from my partner. I constantly seek it from him even throw hints to him to love me or give ideas of what we can do to make the relationship have a spark again. It goes in one ear and out the other. 

As I am typing this, he’s sleeping on the room and I’m in the living room sofa just sad and thinking. I had my coffee up and energized and I know he’s resting today from his only day off but I I don’t work he’s the breadwinner and he can afford to take me places and on dates but just chooses not to. I am seeking something I shouldn’t and I have stepped out of the relationship because such. But I don’t want to do that and I just want it from him. I’m seeking something I will probably never get. I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m feeling bad and he also knows other men give me attention I try getting him jealous and throw it in his face but he shows no signs of jealousy or even care. Im just a lonely women at the end of the day and I feel like I try my best to fix the relationship but I can’t stop feeling lonely constantly. I don’t know what to do anymore. Or how to make him try. I feel bad about what I do but at the moment I am just being spiteful and want what I’m missing to be fulfilled, I’m only human. I’m not perfect or preach to be.

1qiamm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1qiamm8/the_supplement_stack_you_actually_need/,The Supplement Stack You Actually NEED (Science-Based Guide to Cut Through the BS),"Look, 99% of supplement advice online is either garbage marketing or bro science from people who've never opened a research paper. I've spent months diving into what actually works, reading studies, listening to experts like Dr. Layne Norton, and cutting through the bullshit. Here's what I found: most supplements are a waste of money. But there are a few that are genuinely backed by solid research and can make a real difference.

The supplement industry is a $150 billion scam machine designed to sell you magic pills for problems you don't have. They prey on your insecurity, your desire for shortcuts, and your confusion about what actually works. But here's the truth: supplements are called ""supplements"" for a reason. They supplement an already solid foundation of nutrition, sleep, and training. They're not magic. They won't fix a shit diet or replace actual work.

That said, there ARE a few supplements with legitimate research behind them that can genuinely help. Let's break down the stack that actually matters.

Step 1: Get Your Basics Right First

Before you spend a dime on supplements, fix these fundamentals:

Eat enough protein (0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight if you're active)

Sleep 7-9 hours consistently

Train with progressive overload

Manage stress

If these aren't dialed in, supplements won't do jack. You can't supplement your way out of a terrible lifestyle. Once you've got the basics down, here's what actually works.

Step 2: Creatine Monohydrate (The GOAT)

This is the most researched supplement on the planet. Over 500 studies back it up. Creatine isn't just for meatheads trying to get jacked. It helps with strength, muscle growth, cognitive function, and even mood.

How it works: Creatine helps regenerate ATP, your body's energy currency. More ATP means better performance in the gym and sharper mental performance.

Dosing: 5 grams daily. Every day. Don't overcomplicate it with loading phases or cycling. Just take it consistently.

Dr. Layne Norton's take: He's been crystal clear on his podcast, Biolayne, that creatine is one of the few supplements with bulletproof evidence. If you're only going to take one supplement, make it this.

Side note: Some people worry about hair loss or kidney damage. The research shows these concerns are mostly unfounded for healthy individuals. If you have kidney issues, talk to your doctor first.

Step 3: Vitamin D3 (The Sunshine Pill)

Unless you live on a beach and spend hours outside daily, you're probably deficient in vitamin D. It's estimated that around 40% of Americans are deficient, and this affects everything from bone health to immune function to mood.

Why it matters: Vitamin D acts more like a hormone than a vitamin. It regulates immune function, supports bone health, improves mood, and even helps with muscle function.

Dosing: 2,000-4,000 IU daily, depending on your levels. Get blood work done to check your levels first. Pair it with K2 for better absorption and to prevent calcium buildup in arteries.

Real talk: I started taking D3 after realizing I was spending 90% of my time indoors. The difference in energy and mood was noticeable within a few weeks. This isn't placebo, the research on vitamin D and mood is solid.

Step 4: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA)

Most people's diets are loaded with omega-6 fatty acids (from vegetable oils, processed foods) but lacking in omega-3s (from fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, sardines). This imbalance drives inflammation, which is linked to heart disease, brain fog, and joint pain.

Why it matters: Omega-3s, specifically EPA and DHA, support heart health, reduce inflammation, improve brain function, and even help with mental health issues like depression.

Dosing: Aim for 2-3 grams of combined EPA/DHA daily. If you're eating fatty fish 2-3 times per week, you might not need to supplement. If not, get a quality fish oil or algae-based omega-3 supplement.

Book rec: Check out [The Omega-3 Connection](https://) by Dr. Andrew Stoll. This book dives deep into how omega-3s impact mental health and why they're critical for brain function. It's a game changer if you struggle with mood issues or brain fog.

Step 5: Magnesium (The Chill Pill)

Magnesium is involved in over 300 biochemical reactions in your body. It helps with muscle relaxation, sleep quality, stress management, and even bone health. Most people don't get enough from food alone.

Why it matters: Low magnesium is linked to poor sleep, anxiety, muscle cramps, and even heart issues.

Dosing: 200-400mg daily. Magnesium glycinate or threonate are the best forms. Glycinate helps with sleep and relaxation, threonate specifically targets brain health.

Pro tip: Take it before bed. It'll help you relax and improve sleep quality. I started taking magnesium glycinate after reading about it in Matthew Walker's [Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep) and noticing I was waking up multiple times per night. Sleep quality improved noticeably.

Step 6: Protein Powder (If You Need It)

Protein powder isn't necessary if you're hitting your protein targets through whole foods. But it's convenient, especially if you're busy or struggle to eat enough protein.

Why it matters: Protein supports muscle growth, recovery, satiety, and even bone health. Most people undershoot their protein needs.

Dosing: Use it to fill gaps. If you need 150g of protein daily and only get 100g from food, add a 25-30g shake.

Quality matters: Look for brands that are third party tested (NSF Certified for Sport, Informed Choice). Whey protein is great for most people, but if you're lactose intolerant or vegan, opt for pea or rice protein blends.

Step 7: Caffeine (The Legal Drug)

Caffeine isn't just for waking up. It's a legit performance enhancer for both physical and mental performance. Studies show it improves endurance, strength, focus, and reaction time.

Dosing: 100-200mg before workouts or mentally demanding tasks. Don't overdo it. Tolerance builds quickly, and too much caffeine tanks sleep quality.

Real talk: If you're relying on caffeine to function because you're sleeping like shit, fix your sleep first. Caffeine masks the problem but doesn't solve it.

Step 8: Know What NOT to Take

Here's where most people waste money:

BCAAs: Useless if you're eating enough protein. Total marketing scam.

Fat burners: Mostly caffeine and worthless ingredients. Save your money.

Testosterone boosters: Unless you have clinically low T, these won't do anything. And if you DO have low T, actual TRT is what you need, not some sketchy supplement.

Pre-workouts: Mostly overpriced caffeine with a bunch of filler. Just drink coffee.

Book rec: [Bigger Leaner Stronger](https://) by Michael Matthews breaks down the science of supplementation in a no-BS way. He cuts through the industry garbage and tells you exactly what works and what doesn't. Insanely good read if you want to stop wasting money on supplements.

If reading full books feels like too much of a time commitment, there's an AI-powered app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450?utm_source=chatgpt.com) that's genuinely worth checking out. It pulls insights from nutrition science research, books like the ones mentioned above, and expert podcasts to create personalized audio content based on what you actually want to learn. You can ask it to build you a learning plan around optimizing your supplement stack or understanding sports nutrition science, and it'll generate episodes tailored to your depth preference, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voices are surprisingly addictive, think smoky and engaging, not robotic. Makes absorbing this kind of information way more convenient during commutes or gym sessions.

Final Word: Supplements Are the Cherry on Top

Supplements aren't magic. They won't fix a bad diet, lack of sleep, or inconsistent training. But once you've got the basics locked in, the right supplements can give you that extra 5-10% edge. Creatine, vitamin D, omega-3s, and magnesium are the core four with the strongest research backing. Everything else is optional or situational.

Hey,

Hoping to meet someone who'd also like to develop chemistry over a cuddle and a conversation. It's been a long few weeks and I've been having some trouble sleeping over work, recent events, and life all together. Being lonely is nothing new so I'm challenging myself to connect with other lovely folk and talk about anything that comes up. There's something deeply fulfilling about prospering from one another's presence and dialogue. I've also found to connect deeply with others through the means of massaging. It's a very profound experience to have and I found myself opening up more to the idea of relieving others of their stress to be satisfying for both parties!

About me: 28, 5'6"", latino, fit, i thoroughly enjoy exercising, watching and identifying birds, voice calls, singing, dancing, socializing (I bartend in NYC!), jazz clubs, museum visitations, and movie watching.

That being said, I was thinking about ditching my pointless coffee shop job, and attempt ED Tech while doing pre nursing. I have heard from colleagues that tackling those two can be very draining however I am different from my colleagues in that medicine is nearly a hobby for me- which is to say I enjoy the hell out of it.

  
My current semester might not be a good idea for that, as my current schedule is very lab intensive and holds my important classes- biology, anatomy, psychology, and chem. Generally curious if it is worth attempting and applying while having little field experience aside from rotations and some volunteer.

I really loved this little boi. It was a gift from my cousin for helping him set up a r36max. It opened up my heart for old games again because they look so much better on it's small screen. After this I upgraded to a Batlexp g350 which I'm using now. This was my last meal on the cafe with it and my trusty kindle. I had some of the best three free hours for gaming and reading of the whole year. The banana-caramel cheesecake and coffee were very welcomed too. 

And my inner kid was back for a sec. Yes, that chinese, clicky and cheaply made console, the r36s, made me feel like a kid again. 

You don't forget that feeling as an adult.

Ever. Period. Even when you get a better console. ",8,1768936768.0,R36S,4,0.84,False

### Health and Wellness Devotional: Awakening to Wonder in Everyday Life

**Scripture Reflection:**

*“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made…”*

- Romans 1:20

#### **Awakening to Wonder**

In the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, it’s easy to overlook the remarkable gifts surrounding us—gifts meticulously woven into creation by our Creator. Awakening to wonder means recognizing the divine in every moment, from the simplest interactions to the most profound experiences. As we journey towards health and wellness, it’s essential to incorporate this perspective into how we care for ourselves.

#### **Finding the Divine in Health and Wellness**

1. **Connect with Nature:**
  
  Step outside and breathe in the fresh air. Observe the beauty of nature—the vibrant colors, the gentle rustling of leaves, the warmth of the sun. Each element is a reflection of God’s creativity. Spending time in nature rejuvenates our spirits, reduces stress, and reminds us of the Creator’s presence. Schedule time in natural surroundings, whether it’s a walk in the park or simply sitting on a bench, andlet the world around you ignite a sense of wonder.
2. **Mindful Eating:**
  
  Consider the meal before you. Each ingredient tells a story of growth, care, and connection. When we eat mindfully, savoring each bite, we not only nourish our bodies but also awaken to the intricate design of sustenance. This practice can transform the mundane act of eating into a sacred experience. Try creating a small ritual around meals—give thanks, share stories, or talk about the nutrients and flavors you’re enjoying.
3. **Celebrate Rest:**
  
  In our fast-paced society, rest can feel like an inconvenience. Yet, rest is an essential part of wellbeing. God designed us to need periods of restoration. Schedule moments of stillness in your day—whether through meditation, prayer, or a peaceful pause—and allow yourself to be present. In these moments, you can connect with the divine peace that refreshes your weary soul.
4. **Practice Gratitude:**
  
  Start or end each day by listing three things you’re grateful for. It can be as simple as a warm cup of coffee or a kind word from a friend. Gratitude shifts our focus from what we lack to the abundance around us. This positive mindset cultivates joy and strengthens our emotional wellness. Cherish the little wonders that fill your life with meaning.
5. **Engage in Community:**
  
  Connection is vital for our health. Engage with others who inspire, uplift, and challenge you. Whether through group activities, and wellness classes, or simply sharing meals, these interactions allow you to experience love and support. Remember that God works through people; when we open ourselves to community, we open ourselves to God’s love.

#### **Encouragement for the Journey**

Today, take a moment to pause. Reflect on how you can awaken to the wonder within yourself and the world around you. Incorporate the divine into your wellness journey. As you commit to nourishing your body, mind, and spirit, remember that each small step is significant and part of a greater story.

**Prayer:**

Heavenly Father, thank You for the beauty of creation and the gifts of health and wellness. Help me to awaken to the wonder You’ve placed in my life. Guide me as I seek to nourish my body, mind, and spirit. Let every moment remind me of Your presence and love. Amen.

#### **Challenge of the Week:**

Choose one area of your life to focus on this week—nature, mindful eating, rest, gratitude, or community. Set a goal that deepens your connection to that area and document your experience. At the week’s end, reflect on how it has influenced your sense of wonder and wellbeing.

- - - - - -

Embrace each day as a beautiful opportunity to recognize the divine in the ordinary. Let this awareness inspire you on your journey toward holistic health and wellness, and may you sparkle with the wonder that is ever-present in your life.

1qiahgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1qiahgf/flash_fiction_the_letter/,Flash Fiction - The Letter,"Note- This is an unedited story and will be later revised, though I am making it for fun this time since it's a flash fiction. Also this was created by a 12 year old so don't expect much.

One day, I was drinking coffee when I got a letter, with no address and just a piece of paper saying, 



*Come at 8 P.M. today.*

*Coordinates - N.5894, W.4884*



My hair at the back of my neck went up by looking at the letter. What does this mean? For all I know, I am a good girl who is nice to everybody. 



I tear the letter in half and throw it in the dustbin. This is just rubbish. Possibly a trick to kidnap me.



I pack my bag and go to the office, forgetting about the letter.



The next day, it happens again. But instead of 1 letter, I get 2. I still rip the paper in half.



Next day, again. But this time, 4 letters. This time it read,



*Don’t ignore it. Come at 8 P.M. today.*

*Coordinates - N.5894, W.4884*



Why can’t I ignore it? I rip the paper in half again and throw it. 



In the office, I tell my best friend about it.



“I am getting a letter every day in my home saying to come at 8 P.M at these coordinates or something like that.”



“That is very unusual. Maybe tell the post office to not send these letters.” She has a good point.



I go to the post office and tell them about the letter and ask them not to send it again.



“But we are not sending these letters. And don’t waste my time.” The person replies.



I drive home thinking about that letter. Let’s forget about it. Maybe it will stop the next day.



But the next day, I still get letters. This time, 8. I can’t ignore them. I should go to these coordinates and find out for myself. Maybe I am stupid but I am an adventurous girl. 



I take a knife and pepper spray and drive to these coordinates at 7:34 P.M.



The coordinates are located in a dense forest and no cities around them. Maybe going here is not a good idea. I can turn back. But let’s go. I know self defense.



The coordinates are in a warehouse with a door saying, *Come inside*. My hands start to sweat. I grip the knife strongly in my hand and open the door. It is creaking loudly.



But to my surprise, there was a big sign saying, *Happy Birthday Amy!*, with some of my best friends throwing confetti and a table with a big cake.



“You always celebrate your birthday alone so we thought of surprising you.” Sophia, my oldest best friend says.



While celebrating my birthday, I thank God for giving me the best best friends in the world.

[**Brandee Younger**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/brandee-younger/) at **Hayti Heritage Center 🫶**

* Harpist Brandee Younger is redefining what her instrument can do—and who it’s for. On Gadabout Season, her latest release for Impulse!, she plays Alice Coltrane’s own harp, offering a powerful tribute that’s as much about joy and self-discovery as sound. Deeply rooted in spiritual jazz, hip-hop, and classical tradition, Younger’s music is emotionally direct and rhythmically alive. Whether whispering or wailing, her playing defies cliché—birthing a genre-defying earth tones that AllMusic declares “could only be born in the 21st century.” A singularity exploring uncharted musical territory for a new generation of listeners.

# Running Art Exhibits



[**Art Exhibit — Sherman Fleming: Unsettled**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-sherman-fleming-unsettled/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**

* Known for his provocative performances, Sherman Fleming (b. 1953), is an influential multimedia artist based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This focused survey gathers works spanning forty years of Fleming’s career, presenting paintings, drawings, ephemera, and documentation of his performances made between 1978–2019.
* Fleming’s works are demonstrations of perseverance, self-control, and conviction. The artist’s main medium is his body, which he uses in myriad ways. His endurance performances span hours and even months and include walking through Philadelphia for a day while carrying an eight-foot-tall wooden phallus along with spending a year wearing a noose—objects purposely chosen as material reminders of racial and sexual stereotypes of Black masculinity as well as the ongoing trauma of racialized terrorism in the United States.
* The unsettling nature of his work pushes the boundaries of discomfort as the imagery features both difficult subjects and unresolved compositions. Overall, Fleming’s complex practice is connected through his relentless processes that consistently expand the horizons of what art can be and how it may be experienced on paper, canvas, in a gallery, in a theatre, or even live on the street. Through his innovative explorations of identity, the artist’s messaging continues to resonate in profound ways, many years after its making.
* Tu-Sa 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Su 12-5 p.m.
* September 29- January 18

[**Jordan Abdur-Ra’oof Exhibition: Life of Service**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/jordan-abdur-raoof-exhibition-life-of-service/) at **Durham Visitor Information Center 🫶**

* Photographer Jordan Abdur-Ra’oof has transformed the Visitor Info Center to an ode to Durham hospitality. His exhibition, [Life is Service](https://www.lifeisservice.space/), highlights community, connection, and hospitality, showcasing people from beloved local businesses. Add a stop to the Visitor Info Center to check off a [Love Durham](https://www.discoverdurham.com/love-durham/) spot as part of the Creative Challenge!
* The Visitor Info Center is open every Tuesday-Saturday, 10am-5pm.
* Free
* Through Feb. 28

[**Winter**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/winter-at-5-points-gallery-members-exhibit/) at **5 Points Gallery**

* 5 Points Gallery is pleased to present Winter at 5 Points: Gallery Members Exhibit, bringing together new and recent works from the gallery’s member artists in a winter presentation shaped by distinct voices, materials, and ways of seeing. The exhibition moves from intuitive and outsider-influenced expressions to layered abstraction, imaginative figurative scenes, nature-inspired painting, fused glass work, and the refined craftsmanship of finely made furniture. Subtle threads of empowerment, heritage, connection to the natural world, and messages of peace and care for others emerge throughout, creating a sense of continuity across otherwise varied practices. Seen together, these works invite viewers to linger and experience the depth and richness of the artists’ creative worlds.
* Join in for the Third Friday Reception on January 16 from 6–9pm as part of Durham’s Third Friday Art Walk. Meet the artists and experience this seasonal exhibition.
* Visit 5 Points Gallery in person or online. All work from the exhibition is available for shipping or pickup. Gallery hours are Thursdays and Fridays 5–9pm and Saturdays 1–9pm. Artists are available to talk about their work.
* Free
* January 16-Feb 14

[**Art Exhibit — Dis/orient: Contemporary Art of the Asian Diaspora**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/art-exhibit-dis-orient-contemporary-art-of-the-asian-diaspora/) at **Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University**

* A focused exhibition that examines how artists of Asian descent confront long-standing stereotypes embedded in the word “Orient.” Rooted in Western imperialism, the term historically enforced a sense of distance and “otherness” that continues to shape cultural perceptions today. Dis/orient brings together artists who use humor, memory, tradition, and personal narrative to challenge this legacy and illuminate the richness and multiplicity of the Asian diaspora.
* “Dis/orient invites viewers to look beyond the flattened idea of a single ‘Orient’ and instead appreciate the complexity, humor, and emotional depth that define contemporary Asian diasporic art,” said Julianne Miao, curatorial associate at the Nasher Museum. “Each artist brings a distinct perspective, reminding us that identity is never monolithic. It is lived, questioned, and continually reshaped.”
* Tu-Sa 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Su 12-5 p.m.
* January 4- July 19

[**Art Exhibition — Labor&Materials and The Intuitionist**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/exhibition-opening-reception-labor-materials-and-the-intuitionist-2/) at **21c Museum Hotel Durham**

The exhibitions feature a thematic group exhibition of 67 multi-media artworks by 40 artists from across the globe exploring the evolution of industry and labor in the 21st century and a two-person exhibition of paintings by Atlanta-based artist Xavier Daniels and Toronto-based artist Natia Lemay.

1qia9at,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qia9at,"(Yet another) coffee tracking website. 100% All Natural, No Artificial Intelligence.","I design websites, so I set out to build a little tool to track my variables for brewing espresso and pour over. I guess I got, well, a little carried away. I don’t see a rule against post sites like this, but please let me know if I should remove it.

[**https://coffee-tracker.com/**](https://coffee-tracker.com/)

As you can see from the screenshots: you add your equipment, enter a coffee or two, and record the parameters of your brew. Not quite there? Make a new brew and compare results. There are tons of goodies in the details, but I won’t bore you. I’ve set up a “demo mode” you can activate with sample data so you can play with it yourself without having to enter anything yourself. Along the way, I added some resources -- like the ""bean database"" list from r/Espresso and a roaster poll from r/Pourover \-- that I thought might be interesting or helpful to folks. I have to say, I'm dialing in three different beans for pour over, and three more for espresso right now. The site is a *huge* help keeping track.

It should go without saying (but I guess it doesn’t these days) that the site is 100% free, 100% ad-free, 100% AI-free, and open source if you like that sort of thing.

I’d love to know what folks think if you have time to check it out, and would be interested to know if you could see yourself using the site. I’m happy to answer questions. Feedback, comments, complaints, criticism, feature requests all welcome. It’s got a few rough edges here and there so bug reports are welcome too.

PS: I should mention that I purposefully have *not* used beanconqueror or another app/site until I got to this point. I wanted to go with my own ideas and then later compare the different approaches to features and user experience design. So I'm clearly not saying the site is better than any other, just different.

Uno reverse card as when Andre was getting ready, teddie was doing nothing. Chilling on the bed, eating an entire container of cookies made by Liam, cuddling with ringo, hiding in Andre’s hoodie that was becoming not all that big on her. “Cmon bear, ya gotta get ready” he’d been telling her all week, he tried pulling every string to get her out of it but it just didn’t work. She *had* to come, it was just orders, as atlas would say…

T: Do I have toooooooo? Like you know-

A: tried everything

T: fk mannnnnn—hey remember when I fell last week? My ankle is still hurting-

A: they’re going to tell you to strap an ice pack on it and keep walking.

T: What about, wife’s in the hospital? Dumb btch couldn’t control her stress again?

A: don’t call yourself that, thought, they’ll drag you from the ER and to the event. 

T: she’s dead?

A: they’ll bring your gravestone & body.

T: BULLSH!T THERES NO FKING WAY—fk man—you formal people suck-

A: unfortunately that’s just how it is, min dronning.

He gave her a simple cheek kiss,”we won’t be there long, look, we won’t be there any longer than we’re supposed to be. As soon as the reasoning we’re there is complete, we’re gone-“ “and you-“ “yes, I’ll get you ice cream” she giggled to his response. Earning him a full kiss from teddie, she ran both hands through his hair before leaning back and pulling him along with her. They had to get ready so he pulled away from the kiss, signaling to Teddie that yeah, it’s time to get ready, I guess. 

About a half hour later, Andre walked out into the living room to find Teddie, in a simplistic yet stunning red dress. *Red suits you well*, ran through his head. I mean red is a warm color, she had a warm color pallet, and red is warm like the nature she provides. It’s easy to just melt into the moment with her. Teddie was laying on the couch, cuddling with Ringo one last time before leaving. 

“You ready to go?” 

“No, my back hurts” she complained.

He softly chuckled and sat near her on the couch,”I can’t tell if you’re trying to get out of this or if it actually hurts.” 

She groaned in response,”like my back aching is new?” 

He pulled her close, leaning her back towards his chest and placing one of her bangs closest to him behind her ear to give her cheek a kiss. “4 hours tops. We leave as soon as we can, I promise.” 

“You can’t just go?” She pleaded with wide eyes.

“I really tried, love, I did” He sighed,”we don’t have to leave right now…we can chill here for a bit.” 

She lit up for a second,”how long?” 

“You’ve got 30 minutes”

30 minutes was long enough for cuddling and a nap, pulling her boys in close for a minute so she could enjoy their warmth. 

*That damn cat*. Andre didn’t fully *hate* ringo, but I mean the mf fked up his eye—as Thomas said, he looked like a James Bond character—not sure if that’s a compliment or what but regardless this is probably gonna be on his face forever. His dau-son-gummy. Teddie is right, harder to acknowledge gummy as a person than a baby. A person. And she wasn’t wrong when the thought came across as weird. 

He took off her glasses as soon as her felt teddie go still, only small movement of her breathing and allowing her to rest.

\*Tonight’s gonna feel like forever…\*when is an army event ever quick? When do they ever end? The mission tonight is just get in and get out. Thats all they intend on doing. 

Holding hands in the middle of the car’s console, driving through an, as she sang, winter wonderland. 

“In the meadow we could build a snowman, we pretend he’s a loved one too\~, he’ll say ‘are you married’, we’ll say,’yes man—tied the knot last time we were in town\~’”

Her voice like a bell, a harmony, a serenade. She should stop now so he isn’t distracted from driving, how did people drive to her music without getting fully enamored in her world. She could build a universe with a pen and her voice—\*took a pencil to her temple, connected it to her brain—\*fk man. There goes the musicals he’s been exposed to again. 

She sang the entire way there, and he could’ve driven back home, and back here, just to hear her all over again. But if anything she should rest. She should be resting, shouldn’t eve- 

“Mannnn who tipped them off?” She whined.

“It’s a high profile *army* event, min dronning, of course they want to catch what the rich people wear. And Teddie’s-“

“Made it pretty fkn public that my husband is the red leader, that I joined the army’s for my boyfriend—do I need a reminder?” 

“Ah I was gonna say, Teddie’s arriving pre-American-football-game-performance and everyone wanted to see her but that works too.”

“Do I…look noticeable?”

*Yes*. She did. So hard to hide the whole army’s know now and it’s a rumor in the public eye. Her coat wasn’t doing much favors for her, if anything I’d just fuel what everyone else was judging her for. But if there’s one thing Andre can’t fk up, it’s fking up a photo.

“When we walk out, flip it.” He smiled.

“Huh?”

“Flip. It.”

“The middle?? To the pap?”

He nodded.

“Do you know what they would say about me? How rude I am? How-“ 

she started overthinking that move so he had to stop her. 

“And who gives a fk? I sure don’t. No one really does. And what do you owe them? Nothing but a middle finger” he got out of the car to open her door and they ran from the car to the entrance, middles pointed in towards the people with all the flashing lights and cameras. The paparazzi catching blurry photos of the couple adorned in red, from his uniform to her dress and hair, they were matching to the T. 15 seconds of hell and overstimulation for teddie. 15 seconds of freezing temperature, for teddie, Andre couldn’t be less affected by the snowy terrain. They entered into pure warmth and a soirée filled with minimal color. You’re here to to represent your army, and your army only

“Look, you say the word and we’re gone” Andre promised.

“I’m ready to go”

“No” he chuckled,”ok not right now-“

That’s when two men approached him. They were higher ups, their outfits showing minimal color but their retired legacy pins showing one worked for the blue army and the other yellow. *If retirees are here, is atlas here too?just another ploy to talk again? I mean if he is here we’re avoiding him at all costs.* They said nothing of interest, just a congratulations for everything that happened at reevaluations. 

“You know, sometime in march there’s a training camp running for a few weeks, focusing on hand-to-hand. Last I checked you weren’t that great in that department right, Andre?” The one with the blue pin asked.

“…hm? Yes but-“

“March? Aww man” Teddie interrupted him,” march is by the time I’m due. It’d be a shame if he wasn’t around..” she could already sense they were gonna try and pressure him to sign up. All these people were salesmen anyway.

“Does he really need to be there?” Blue pin asked her?

*“Does he really need to be there?”* She shot back.

“Well, it was just an idea” the yellow pin ended the conversation.

Interlocking arms,”you’ve conned them” he playfully teased.

“You owe me\~” she threw back.

Andre looked around the room in hopes of not spotting his father, *so far in the clear,* tonight was already feeling…off to him. Too much of it felt familiar her just couldn’t put his fin-

“*Hamilton’s skill with a quill is undeniable—but what do we have in common???”* Oh god oh geez Liam please don-

*“we reliable with the LADIESSSSS!”* Well, his wife found his brother. They were like magnets—fk Marco Polo these two could quote musicals all day to find each other. First time teddie had a sort of energy in her tonight as she ran up to hug him. Before a waitress passed by and 

“*THERE ARE SO MANY TO DE-FLOW-AAAA—LADIESSSSS LOOKS PROXIMITY TO POWAAAAA”* and the waitress was visibly flustered by the compliment. These two created a scene like no other—this could quite possibly rival that one time they started singing at the dinner. 

“\*LADIESSSSS—\*oh they delighted and distracted him, Martha Washington named her feral tawm cat after him-“

“That’s true”

Please teach about American history more—he just had to roll with the theatre kid punches, watching Teddie and Liam reunite after 2 whole days of not singing in each other’s faces. 

Andre pulled out a chair at a nearby table

”oh with the formalities, you’re such a gentleman” she smiled while shaking her head. 

Andre and Liam sandwiched teddie in terms of sitting down. 

“So where’s cc?” She asked, which like, yeah where’s the arm candy you love to show off so much?

Liam leaned just a bit over the counter and playfully sung “*amorrrr\~?*”

Cc turned his head. In terms of staff and uniforms this man was allergic to any color that wasn’t black or white. Yet tonight the most color he wore was a red bow tie. He made his way over to the trio to make it an official group. 

“He looks so handsome, doesn’t he?” Liam loosened \*his husband’s—\*and he won’t let you forget that—bow tie. 

“Hi zooble” Teddie giggled

“Will you two ever drop that?” He joked

“When you stop being a grumpy bartender who likes to tear everyone to shreds.” Liam bit his lip—*he’s down bad-*

“Zooble would come up with silly nicknames for everyone they way cc does—wait you’re even wearing gangle!” Oh the way teddies brain just clicked everything’s a reference.

Cc looked down and saw the assimilation to the ribbon character and shot a lovingly lethal glare towards his husband, who gave him the biggest grin. If there’s one thing these two do way to often it’s set others up to walk straight into their inside jokes.

The greatest part about them? It’s not at anyone’s expense. No one hates themselves over these jokes. What’s the worst the word ‘zooble’ is gonna do to your perception of yourself. It was nothing near the likeness of ‘mutt’. All the theatre kids would call him is ‘Jax’ though Liam often referred to it more as ‘jaxie-boy’ in his best teddie impression. 

“So it this the bar scene—knew I shoulda worn my suit instead.” Teddie, don’t start with the regrets.

“Then you would’ve needed Andre to match with you.” 

“Would you had matched with me?” She leans in a little closer to ask him.

“Do you think that they would’ve let the *red leaders wife* wear pants?”

“I hate it here—why so old timey?”

“Just how it is” huh, interesting. He hated those words. It was like conforming to something you know is wrong. She told him that all the time, especially when it came to her health, always pissed him off because of the ‘*what if’* of it all. Women in general are dismissed, let it be the army’s or healthcare. 

“Let me get a whisky sour, im so tired of conversation” Thomas cut the room between Teddie and Andre. 

“Coming right up”

“Damn no please at least-“ Liam jumped right in, ruined his precious flirting as if he was still trying to bag cc-

“He’s a *bartender*, its his *job*, it’s what he’s being *paid for*”

They exchanged glances like the army’s about to find out who’s stronger, a wendigo or a monster.

“Please” he added begrudgingly. Being handed his drink he added a,”thanks bazooble” 

“Wow a TADC reference?????”

“From THOMAS!?”

“Evil Jax watching Tommy replace him in all the family photo alb-“

Both faces light up, they’ve got an idea, a horrible just god awful idea. They’re scheming again—OFFICER ITS THESE TWO-ITS THEM-

Andre rather be surprised by whatever these two come up with than watch them plot to burn the world down in real time. He catches up to Thomas and they stand beside the ballroom, watching the sea of yellow, red, green, blue, and black uniforms do whatever it is that they’re doing. 

“Need a drink?” Tom offered his glass.

“Don’t drink at all” Andre shook his head and passed on the glass. 

“I don’t blame you as long as *she’s* in the vicinity. But you shouldn’t let her and her actions dictate your entire life” 

“Oh here we go with the ‘*great moments with Thomas soapes*’”

“I’m serious…tonight feels…familiar”, It felt like his debut, his engagement party, the night—“might just have to give a drunken batshtfaced speech that’ll piss off asslass”

Both men chuckled, and Thomas threw one back.

“Ya know, I haven’t seen Max-“

“Made sure he couldn’t come, if you catch my drift”

“Oh Thomas, only you could avoid all your problems with smooshing-“

“*Smooshing*?”

*Ah crap I’m not reading on Reddit-*

“Teddies been learning how to censor herself-“

“If I put a UV light on the both of you the amount of traces id see with the both of you on eachother-“ he gagged.

His best friend was in love with his sister. As that silly bubble thingy would say *‘disgusting!’* Atleast he was down bad in a good way. He wouldn’t be the kinda man to beat her to a pulp for calling him sweet. Or the kind to cross boundaries because he couldn’t keep it in his pants. He looked at his sister the way his moms looked at eachother, the way Alice looked Steph. 

“If I ever, *ever*, talk about someone the way you talk about my sister. Put me down. As many bullets as you need til I go out. How much you two are obsessed with eachother is truly nauseating” he needed a bit more of alcohol to get through it. 

He looked over to see Andre genuinely lost in thought. Looking over to his blurred direction was teddie and Liam giggling, though he already knew his gaze was hyper fixated on the redhead. Gotta pull him out of it. 

“You know…between you and all your brothers, and I know you the best, you’re gonna be a horrible father.”

“What?” He snapped out of it, ragebait worked. 

“I’m sure my mama, my mom, Travis, Hunter, and Teddie a million times over has told you how great a dad you’re gonna be. I gotta pull the confidence down, can’t get ahead of yourself” 

“Oh Thomas, what would I do without you?”

“Life would go to sht”

Teddie and Liam continued with their own language in a whole nother universe, til:

“Akevitt” Norski accent cut through the conversation. “Ah well if it isn’t nice to see you Teddie”

“Hi Andy, still playing with buzz lightyear?” She smiled, silly one that Teddie.

“Ah I think I’ve got something better to play with” he leaned in closer, barely any space between them. Teddie tried to back away, just being saved by Andy’s drink being served.

She let out a sigh of relief as a thanks to the bartender. He took a swig before trying another pick up line, this was all in the hopes she’d end up falling before resorting. 

“You know…I could show you a real ball\~” he kissed her gloved hand. She turned back to mouth ‘why I wear gloves’ to the bartender and his husband.

“Like a basketball? Or a football—wait no don’t remind me of football I’ve been reminded enough of it-“ always off track, that mind of hers.

“Nah I could show you a better time than this\~ you know what you missed out on during the cotillion” 

She deadpanned him.

“*Andy never recovered, and Teddie went*  *q u i c k*” she got up and shifted seats to…well anywhere that wasn’t near Andrew.

“Isn’t it kinda fked up to quote *that* part of the song” Liam looked at her with a sort of fear—that was abt hammy mom like damn-

Andy ended up leaving, meeting someone else. 

“You don’t think he was trying to flirt? I mean it was bad, but-“ 

“Reddit says no one wants a woman with cross-code contamination”

Just then Ayla walked up, in a gorgeous green dress. Wasn’t any bright obnoxious green it was more a nature, matcha, muted tone, only ruined by the mandatory uniform coat.

“Well, Teddie, General Williams, isn’t it nice to see you two”

Liam offered nothing more than a side eye when seeing two drinks in her hand. *I’m sorry where’d you get that from, wasn’t from his husband? He. Dont. Want. It.* He only consumes his cuddlebear’s handcrafted drinks.

Ayla extends a drink to teddie,”thought you like hated me or smth-“ she quizzed the ex.

“Oh that reevaluations stuff, not our beef, me and Andrias’ problems. I don’t see why that has to get between us” 

They *clinked* their glasses before taking a sip. 

“Good Phil-philos-sloppy-uh philosopp-good thinking” Teddie stuttered.

“Well hope you enjoy your night” Ayla dismissed herself. 

“Excuse me? You drink from not my husband?”

“He only serves *alcohol*\-Andre won’t let me drink *coffee*, what makes you think he’ll allow me a swig of *a l c o h o l????*”

“Fai- the hell you doing back?”

Andrew returned with a plate of cake.

“Wowwwww, What’s with all the peace offerings?” Teddie asked, if she had a nickel for every consumable she’d been offered tonight, she’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice.

“Was gonna eat it but then remembered you’re-“

“Please don’t finish that sentence, thank you” she took the plate from his hands. Call her grubby.

Andy felt a bit disrespected by the woman. He walked away, not without throwing a glare in her direction one last time. 

“You trust it?”

“It’s food, when has food ever hurt anyone?”  

“Look bear, i don’t know, I wouldn’t trust it if I were you-“

“Ok if someone else brings me food, it’s a sign that it’s safe.”

They waited all of 5 seconds before Alice approached with a cupcake,”well don’t you look stunning?” 

“Thank you! Yourself included” 

Alice’s outfit wasn’t much, but the pins she wore sparkled very nice on her sleeve. Yellow looked good on her. 

“Got you the last one.” Alice advertised 

“A true lifesaver sis, thank you!” Teddie took the cuppycake from her sister’s hands and licked a bit of frosting off the top. Reminded her husband would steal it she looked over both shoulders, he’s still with Tommy…and now Travis I guess. 

“What are you discussing?” She made the fatal mistake of asking the theatre kids.

“The 10 duel commandments.” Teddie cut.

*“Number one!:”*

*“The challenge, demand satisfaction, if they apologize no need for further action”*

she regrets ever asking.

Travis joined the wall trying to scope out if Bodie had attended. Ever since Andre had told him about…\*the situation…\*a thought that had plagued his mind:

“Would you have done the same if you & teddie ended up in *that* situation?”

“Ohhhh it’s feeling familiar to you too? Are you-“ 

“Don’t say it” Andre elbowed Tom.

“*Do you get Déjà vu? Hm? Do you get Déjà vu? strawberry ice-*“ Thomas’ Teddie impression was short lived as Andre decided to answer his brother’s question.

“What situation?”

“The whole wedlock situation andrias…would you had gone through with it if it was teddie?”

Andre took a good inhale and let out a chuckle. He couldn’t be more tired of the idea, the constant overlap pissed him off and that was his own brain subjecting him to the torture of comparing the two women. 

“Well, teddie & I had some very clear boundaries. Boundaries we both *mutually* respected. We took *time* and *patience*. The *boundaries* she had set up would’ve prevented us from ending up in such a situation.”

“*What if* one of you slipped up?”

“I don’t think it would get there. She’s not like that. She’s not *forceful.* So the answer is to your question is no, because it’s not in the realm of possibility that it ever could’ve occurred. I did it *right*. I made sure I was *married* before ever moving along that base. Marriage shouldn’t be a necessity by force because it looks better. *And* a child generally shouldn’t be introduced into a relationship until the relationship is stable enough to sustain such change.”

Teddie excused herself to get away from the conversation happening in the main room. Too loud in there. The room was dimly lit so to add a bit more comfort to ease her mind she turned on the light up kinger figurine on her bag. Just made her feel a little easier even with such a weak light. 

“Alone?” Emerging from the shadows was Andrew. 

“I’m not in the mood” she groaned.

“I could make you in the mood” he flirted. Felt more like a threat.

“I’m a married woman, Andy when will you give it a rest?” Body felt heavy, eyes felt such too. 

“I could-“ he grabbed her arm, she immediately reacted pushing him and learning to suck it up and just put up with the room rather than Andrew.

Being subjected to such conversation he decided to return to Teddie and Liam after Alice made her exit. He lightly placed his hand on Teddie’s shoulder, and it felt like relief. 

“You holding up alright?” He asked her.

“Can we go outside?” She countered.

He helped her up and out of her chair, interlocked arms, and he escorted her towards the back of the event venue. 

“Oh you need a coat” he took off his uniform’s jacket to place it over her shoulders,”take mine.”

“You did that on purpose” she teased, pulling the coat in for a bit more warmth,”I’m not complaining…it was just…really hot in there.”

“Ah may have just been me, darling.”

He dusted off a bit of snow from a bench near a rose bush, giving his wife a place to rest. Shouldn’t be on her feet long. They took a seat, and Teddie rested her head on Andre’s shoulder, watching the ballroom as conversation and so much more happened inside. They *had* to be there?

“We’re gonna have to take gummy to these kinda things?” She believed she was thinking to herself.

“I mean, yeah, but not for a while from now…nothing to worry about as of *right now*” he reassured his wife.

“I hate these things—I feel bad knowing they’re gonna be subjected to such torture”

“I’ll give em as many passes as I can try but hey, it’s all a part of the game”

She let out a breath, cold air showed the cold puff coming from such a move. 

“I’m tired…”

“No more than 2 hours left, love, look I promise” he took her hand, giving it a kiss like it was sealing that promise. “You can set a timer, as soon as it goes off? We’re out.”

She followed suit and set a timer for 2 hours on her phone, Andre couldn’t help but admire the rosebushes that surrounded them. Such a pretty sight as the courtyard was covered in the blanket of white, the red roses being a beautiful pop of color. 

It was a silly idea but teddie got up, sat down on the ground, maneuvering just enough to where she’s not *touching* the snow. And made a mini snowman, using the pebbles for eyes. 

“And what are you doing?” He playfully asked her.

“Snowman.” She simplistically answered.

“What’s his name?”

“Snowman”

She motioned for his hand, asking him to help her get up. She plucked a little rose from the bush and gave it to the snowman. She’s been out long enough,”we can go back now”

“You sure?”

She simply hummed and they made their way back in. 

He didn’t want her to just be moping and waiting it out for the time being, so instead he offered to dance. He dusted off the knowledge of what she taught him about formally ballroom dancing at the cotillion to impress her. As if she wasn’t already impressed enough with the man she married. She fell hard for him, resting again on his shoulder as they took its slow. Swaying across the floor at a pace, though, wouldn’t be T-e-double d-i-e if she didn’t sing.

“*I’ve rejected all affections for years and years, I have it now and damnit it’s kinda weird, he tells me ‘I’m pretty’, dunno how to respond I tell him that ‘he’s pretty too’, can I say that?????? Don’t have a clue\~*” The slow dancing felt like a sigh of relief, a homestretch if you will. We’re almost out of here… maybe it’s the quite possible fact that everyone in here may want him dead. Hell reevaluations was proof enough, no one have a fk, but her…or maybe it was the uncertainty of his father being present. Christmas don’t go well for us, he’s probably pissed…or maybe it’s just because this mirrored the worst night of his life. Debut. Whatever the case was Andre could feel this sense of…unease. 

*Something’s wrong…*

*“I blink a suddenly I’ve got a valentine\~”*

Should unease come with her voice—yes—and no—*if it’s that one song about running then yes*—but she was singing about loving him. Maybe everything’s fine…

He allowed himself to ease up into the dance, with every harmony she created, it was sorta his comfort now…

*“You’ll be the last one, I ever kiss, the only guy that I’d, ever miss—oh sht maybe I should run, not even 21, I barely even know who I want to-“*

The sound of bullets broke through the glass windows that acted like walls. Bodies were dropping immediately. He immediately attempted to create some sort of human shield out of himself for teddie. Glass finally hitting the floor and we all were retaught the lesson: *Thomas Soapes, loves his job*. At the first gunshot, the man morphed into a whole nother creature. Ready to step into a line of protection—nah Tom did it for the love of the game, to watch as people fear him. Fending off some of the attackers befo—

***BANG*** 

*Well…are we dead? …the world went completely black…*

*“Big Bear? Sht, your arm!”* You could hear her struggle to lift him up.

*~~“Ted, Deal with it in a safer area, cmon-“~~* 

*More gunshots*

Andre woke up in a supply room of sorts, where they kept documents and other things like that. By his side was the explosives, Tn’T, worried about his current medical condition.

“Hon? You all good?” 

She was one of the 1/2 people in the world that didn’t have to be converted to care about his safety. 

“Need ya to get up” 

She was applying pressure to his arm, now adorned in bullets, with some towel. 

Andre’s biggest concern was whether or not she was hurt, even if he was a bit out of it, Teddie wouldn’t know if she was hurt. 

Checking her body for any injury created an opposing force to her care. She moved his hand a few times, wasn’t till he tried to get up, which was a struggle in and of itself, that she finally snapped.

“ fk Andrias! I’m fine! You *don’t* need to worry abt me all the *goddamn* time, you’re *actually* injured! So*let me, help you*.”

Andre’s learned better not to care abt himself, most times she was his priority, he can’t risk losing her. But then again, she has quite a stern tone.

 Dunno where she found that towel but, she took off the red ribbon tied around her wrist and tied the ribbon tight enough to hold and stop the bleeding. 

Though she was pissed, she loves him, and after knotting that bow, kissed the wound, then his hand. 

*They can’t stay mad at each other long.*

“Guys this is fking disgusting, please stop.” Thomas intervened, no longer the man eating monster and now js a guy forced to watch his best friend and sister debate abt fking again, essentially. 

Andre got up slowly this time, teddie sitting beside him as they devised a plan.

“No clue on who?” Andre asked, best they found out the *who* first, so they can get to the *why*.

“Nah, best guess? Smth about rich folks…or that sht at reevaluations-“

How he hoped it had nothing to do with that, that meant teddie would be a main target. I mean, *himself too*, but she’s at disadvantage—severely unfair.

Admist the deeper conversation on how to get out, Someone else has the idea to hide here too. The rattling of the door has no indication of an ally or enemy, the best they could do was prepare to fight. The door opened, Andre reached for his gun, Teddie had her blades drawn and prepared, and Thomas had shaped his hands into a death trap—essentially his fork and knife. The door opened to, silly ass Travis followed by Cody?

“Fk man we linebacked here! Does the Americans understand that joke?” Cody attempted to save their lives.

“Plenty” Tom responded to it like more of a threat

“Andre! You’re here!” Travis said with relief. Short lived by him realizing his injury, quite literally tied up with a bow, by his wife. Teddie may look innocent but *is she to be trusted*? Also of note was that even if it was slight, Andre was just a few inches in front of Teddie, ready to take more bullets for her if it meant she was safe. 

The group agreed to make it to the garage, making their way out of the documents room and far, far down into the garage where car were parked. 

Opening the door the air was quiet…

Should’ve been filled with chaos but it was quiet…

*Too quiet…* 

Making their way through, teddie noticed another piece of ribbon on the floor, thinner than the one on Andre. Which lead her to just blurt out of nowhere:

“*Here comes the general!”*

*“And his right hand man*!”

Could’ve gotten Liam killed, but then again, lyrics were like Marco Polo to the theatre kids. He perked up from his hiding spot and Teddie ran up to him, giving him a big hug. Could these two survive without eachother?????? Idk it was js a thought—

(Also cOmPlEtElY forgot this smol little detail earlier but Liam’s supposed to have a slight limp to his walk…so uh…yeh now it’s in ur brain and *i totally wrote that detail earlier you js weren’t reading hard enough /j*)

She helped the husbands out of their spot and quickly reve-

*Someone else came around the corner,* immediately starting firing at the sight of red uniforms. And all they could do was run, ofc Thomas damn near wiped out the dude but they were like ants, js fkn multiplying-

Liam was slow with his running, wasn’t his fault, he had a limp. Cc and Teddie slowed down to help, they were right there when it all happened. Killed Andre on the inside to be ahead of her, then hope kinda flickered as Thomas quit on trying to squash the ants and more so just get to safety, telling Teddie that he’d help Liam, as long as she got ahead. She ended up finding a room for them to hide in, gunshots still blaring as she held the door open to make sure everyone got inside. Blades ready just in case it was anyone that didn’t have good intentions. 

Someone yelled about getting to safety, Andre couldn’t distinct who though, tonight felt like that night, running was a struggle because he could almost look back and see his mothers last moments. On the ground. Struggling. Bloodsoaked…

Travis shot back, andre finally snapping out of it, joined him. Efforts short lived as someone came charging with a blade just behind Thomas, cc, and Liam. Though teddie was able to get one of her smaller blades in the man’s shoulder before the trio hit inside. 

*The man being in range of teddie was close enough for Andre,* when it comes to hand to hand fighters it feels more lethal. As long as one can get a hit on the other, you’re close enough in range to get a hit too. And that was too much for Andre, unfortunately he married someone skilled in hand to hand, hand to eye coordinations, even if she wore glasses she wasn’t someone you’d wanna fk with hand to hand. But she’s at clear disadvantage with a hitbox bigger than she normally was. 

Holding the door shut just as Thomas, liam, and cc flopped in. Teddie and Andre struggled to hold the door shut, so Thomas and Travis had to join them.

“Open up\~”

You could hear him cutting the wood of the door with his blade.

“I just want to play\~”

He was fking whispering like it was a smash session, like this was turning someone on. Again, piercing their only line of defense right now. 

“Or we could make this real easy and just hand over red.”

Which one?

“Hand. Over. Red.”

….pure silence as they all held their breath…Teddie squeezing Andre’s hand as a lifeline

“No?”

….

“Maybe next time.”

*Deep exhale* 

They gave it awhile before backing from the door, checking for injuries and recouping the plan. 

Something was off after backing away though. Andre noticed that every hole in that door had blood dripping from it. He looked over at Travis, maybe it was him? Trav had sustained no more than a mere nick of a bulled that wasn’t all that serious. Shitty aim.

Thomas? I mean not much to worry about but the man seemed fine. Almost fking invincible-

He looked over to the last one holding the door, she was quite diplomatic for doing so to, but she seemed fine, thought decked out in a fking red dress. 

He approached her praying it wasn’t her. Then he moved her hair slightly to the side to find a stab wound just millimeters away from her. God. Damn. Spine.

Sending chills down his. 

“Fk Ted-“

Teddie felt a flutter in her tummy, is now the time?

Immediately, panic ran through his body. His hands trembled, her blood on his hands…quite literally. 

Maybe it was poetic, like in movies when they have that symbolic moment telling you how it’s gonna end…Teddie was the stand in for his mom.

“Big bear? What’s going on?” She could feel the pressure of his hands on her neck.

*Teddie would end up like his mom.* 

But was he gonna let himself be taken in the name of safety? 

*He could already see it,* her lifeless body. Blood deeping the color of her red dress. Bringing it to more of a burgundy? Another one lost in a raid that would take more lives in the name of war. 

“Dre seriously, what’s the problem?”

*And could he forgive himself?*

She didn’t wanna be here, complained all week about it. Tried til the very last minute to get out of it and yet here she is, got injured for doing her job. 

*Her job.* 

*He seriously let this be his fking wife’s job?* 

*“Andre?”*

the memory of his mother and the current reality of his wife being within his presence were starting to blur.

*“Andre?”*

He could hear the both of them, voices blending together, though they couldn’t be or sound any more different.

Someone you’re supposed to be so in love with you allow them in a world, allow them to take a place where they could lose their life. 

Nah. 

*Where they could fking die?*

“Andre, what’s going on?” You can hear the panic rising in her voice.

How can you say you love this person if you’re not even protecting them?

He held as much as he could, bare hands, what he could think of in the midst of every other thought plaguing his brain. When Thomas finally noticed and stepped in, taking off his tie and holding the wound near her shoulder.

*Why didn’t he think of that?*

All the while teddie was absolutely clueless. He just had to care about someone who had pain delay? *YES!* Ofc he did she is absolutely fking perfect for him, to him. Only person with the possibility to change his mind, not to be pushy, not to be submissive. She had the checks to his balances. 

Teddie finally felt the effects, letting out a sharp inhale, and reaching for her lower back, just to feeling a warm substance oozing from where the pain was radiating. 

“Don’t panic” he tried to reassure her, he was doing the panicking for the both of them,”lower yourself slowly, there’s two more though.”

“The fu-“ she damn near squeaked in terror, Thomas tightened his tie with a double knot effectively stopping the bleeding coming from her shoulder. Lowering herself slowly to her knees, with both men meeting her speed. No rush here.

Liam undid his own tie as a donation to help to the cause, though it could help the neck wound they still need to get that lower back. 

*Too fking close to his child that’s for one.*

Taking off his own belt as it could wrap around her waist, the clinking unfortunately drawing attention. Like he wanted any at all. 

“Oh god, mutt keep it in your-“ 

“fk off Cody—god damnit!” Andre practically barked, pure anger was in his voice.

Teddie let out a hitched sigh, or chuckle, it wasn’t easy to distinguish. It caught his attention, sending him into more of a panic. Teddies hand resting on her side. Fk was it another injury?

”something wrong?” That was as calm as he could muster up. His mind racing at a million miles a minute. Her history? Cramps could mean stress—ofc this was fking stressful. Could it be sending her into early labor—he’d read about that not too long ago. Could it-

“No” she smiled,” no.”

“What’s going on?” He could fking vomit right now with all the stress he felt under. *Fucking nauseous as hell.* 

She gave him a look, yes reassuring but what the he—

*‘Gummy recognizes sounds’*

*‘Sounds?’*

*‘My singing, Liam’s laugh, your cussing-‘*

His cussing, embarrassing, a bit disappointed, but hey\*, it was his.\*

He let out a soft chuckle, *it was his*, and they’re ok. Pure bliss between the lovers as he tightened his belt around her lower back til the bleeding would stop and finally getting to that neck injury. 

Feeling better to an extent he allowed teddie to have a breather. They all could have a fking breather. Liam and cc cuddled up with each other, their whispering was ineligible but it was relieving whatever tension that arose. “I thought this was what we didn’t want?”

“It’s systemic, not parental, and it doesn’t follow us home.”

“They’ll be ok?”

*“They’ll be ok.”*

That was all you could hear from them. 

“So what was your plan again?” Liam picked back up the hallway conversation.

“To summarize:-” Andre was interrupted.

“We’re going to Chesapeake bay.” The one to do so was teddie, if anyone else did it he’d probably be pissed. All he could do was blush.

“*That* far?” 

The conversation drowned out, Travis being in his own head as he watched his brother. Had he ever seen him in such a…soft state? Teddie was in his arms and he held her like glass. He was *making sure*she rested. *Making sure* she got a break. Not an offer, *he made sure of it.* Why? How? It’s fking impossible to wrap his head around. The training idiot, the loud one, the stupid one, she probably has ulterior motives, she-

The clunk of boots passed by the door. 

The silence was deafening.

…

Everyone held their breath. 

….

*ring ring, ring ring*

Who the hell was that?

The panic visibly overtaking teddies face as she tried to stop it. Their time here should’ve been up. They should be going now. That was what the timer was for. But it was too late. Someone bashed the doors handle and it opened with ease.

Thomas once again took form, where it pained Lewis it was second nature for Thomas. He was ready to rip through these fkers while everyone made a break for it. 

Running away while someone tries to protect has to be the most helpless you could feel. Though he knew Tom would most likely be ok, he still felt an ounce of-

*Sht!*

Losing balance, Andre could hear a bone cracking underneath his foot. He’d tripped over another lifeless body’s arm on the ground. One in a red uniform. One of his own. He didn’t want to feel it but a sharp pain shot through his foot, and the footsteps approaching him got louder. 

Trying to reach for his gun in such a panic he wasn’t able to pull it out in time.

He’s fked.

Prepared for his last moments, going out the way his mother did. 

*Protecting his child.*

*His family.*

*The one he wouldn’t get to meet.*

*To see.*

To-

The sound of a blade piercing flesh was nothing but inches away from him. 

It wasn’t his though.

Wifey ex machina.

You really thought she’d let him just go out like that?

I mean he hoped so, better her safety than risking it for him. Like taking the blame for his actions so he didn’t die. Giving up her safety for him. 

She fought like hell if it meant his safety, Andre taking a final few shots to get them out of the situation.

The sound of gunshots made Travis look back. Cody urging him they could leave but Travis realized: Andre wasn’t behind him. Liam and Cc were barely turning the corner. Dismissing his little brother and his husband to follow Cody, he looked back around the corner to see Teddie and Andre barely getting up off the floor. Making his way to help them up but them being able to do so on their own.

1qia2t4,https://i.redd.it/c4blw03xxjeg1.jpeg,I may have found a solution to my chronic bad breath and white tongue,"It’s still early but I THINK I have found a solution that will fix my bad breath that I’ve been dealing with for almost 2 years. 

Wanted to share in case this is helpful for even one person because I’ve never seen this product appear on my many (desperate) Reddit searches. 

THE STORY

I’ve been dealing with bad breath for almost 2 years. I never used to notice or struggle with it until my boyfriend told me \~6 months after we started dating. It wasn’t there at the beginning of our relationship, which is why he noticed when it started smelling bad. 

I’m pretty confident the source of my BB came from tongue bacteria overgrowth that caused a persistent white coating on my tongue (not GERD, tonsil stones, or gut health). From my research it seems like this is a common cause. 

I tried at home solutions (tongue scraper, better dental hygiene, probiotics, even a mouthwash made for dogs lol) but it seemed to only mask the problem temporarily, not fix it. The BB and white coating would always come back after a few hours and I noticed a sulfur-like smell that would get worse after food, coffee, and alcohol. 

As anyone with BB knows it’s so terrible and can really harm your confidence. I would literally stay away from people at work and cry thinking about how my boyfriend didn’t want to kiss me.

I went to 3 different dentists for help. The first one basically dismissed my concerns, saying I should use a tongue scraper (I do) and non-alcoholic mouthwash. The second one prescribed chlorhexidine rinse, which is super intense (kills all bacteria) and can change your taste and stain your teeth brown, so I never tried it. 

The third dentist FINALLY gave me a solution that I think is working, which I’m sharing below.

THE SOLUTION

Dentist #3 gave me this: Dioxicare Rinse. It acts like chlorhexidine, killing all bad mouth bacteria, without the negative side effects or wiping out the “good” bacteria. 

Similar to a smartmouth rinse, you combine two different liquids into a cup and it “activates”. The longer you let the mixture sit, the stronger it gets (I do about 90 seconds). I think this rinse is used to treat a lot of mouth issues like tonsillitis or gingivitis.

It’s been less than a week of using the rinse 2x/day, but I already notice a big difference. It feels like that stubborn sulfur smell in my mouth is gone. Obviously when I eat food it affects my breath, but it feels less persistent and trapped than before. Even my white coating has gone down significantly. 

I’m going to use the rinse for 1-2 months, then update my dentist on progress. But so far, I feel like this could work. The mouthwash was $35 lol but honestly so worth it. Idk if this is the solution for everybody, but if you haven’t tried it perhaps give it a shot! 

Other things that have helped:

\- Tongue scraping - I use Tung gel + brush (from Amazon) and this works so much better than a metal tongue scraper in my opinion. I can see the white come off of my tongue in real time 

\- Oral probiotic - The dentist also gave me an oral probiotic dropper that I use on my tongue after scraping to promote “good” bacteria growth 

\- Mouth taping at night - I might be a mouth breather when I sleep so using mouth tape really helps my morning breath 

\- Diet / hydration - Obviously certain foods make your breath worse (coffee, spicy foods, etc) so being mindful of what you’re eating and when. And staying super hydrated with water all throughout the day! 

\- Being gentle - over scraping and brushing has irritated my tongue before to the point of bleeding and I think it makes bacteria growth worse. 

Good luck to anyone dealing with this! I really feel for you and know how hard it can be. Stay hopeful and please share what has worked for you. ",2,1768935661.0,badbreath,1,1.0,False

1qia27s,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1qia27s/my_boyfriend_does_not_have_a_provider_mentality/,My boyfriend does not have a provider mentality and it bothers me.,"I’ve been in a relationship for a year with my current boyfriend. Overall, it’s a good relationship: I’m treated well, our intimate life is very satisfying, he understands me, and he’s emotionally reliable. In many ways, all the important boxes are checked.

However, over time I’ve noticed something that bothers me: he doesn’t really have a provider mentality. By that I mean that when we’re at a store or the mall, he never offers to pay for anything for me — not even small things. To be clear, he does pay more often at restaurants, for coffee, and he usually covers more in vacations. But it never feels like generosity that comes naturally to him; it feels more like something he does because I’ve communicated that this is what I like and expect.

On the other hand, we both work. I have a very good but demanding job, and on top of that I also run a business. I’m not someone who sits around expecting a man to pay for everything. Quite the opposite — I also compensate in other ways. For example, he doesn’t have a car, so I lend him mine whenever he needs it, which honestly bothers me a bit because I’ve always had my own car and never dealt with this issue before. Same with a laptop — I lend him mine because he doesn’t have one suitable for work. So while he may pay more for restaurants and outings, I clearly contribute and compensate too.

This weekend, I told him I’d like to see more generosity and initiative from him. For example, if we’re at the mall and I like a necklace and I’m hesitating whether to buy it or not — and I’m not talking about expensive things — I’d love for him to have the initiative to say, “Come on, I’ll get it for you.” Just that kind of gesture.

He said he understands, but that he doesn’t really have that mentality and that these things “come with time.” I completely disagree. In my view, generosity and willingness to give don’t come later — they’re there from the beginning when someone is serious about you.

There was even a moment early in our relationship when we were at the supermarket: we each had a few items, similar amounts, and he put the divider between our groceries on the conveyor belt — the one that says “next customer.” We’re talking about a very small amount of money, but that gesture really stuck with me.

When I brought this up, he got defensive and took it as if I were reproaching him for not buying me gifts, which isn’t the case. What I actually want is to see more generosity, more joy and pleasure in giving. I understand that after our discussion he said he would try to change because it matters to me, but it’s very clear that this is not his natural mindset.

So I’m wondering: what do you think? Am I being unreasonable? I don’t think there’s a woman out there who doesn’t appreciate a man who takes initiative financially, even in small gestures and thoughtful details.",0,1768935630.0,love,29,0.38,False

1qi9yep,https://i.redd.it/wm3n3ed5xjeg1.jpeg,Help!,"Hey Cat people.

 

My husband and I have had our cat, Murphy, for six years. We decided when we got him that we’d keep him indoors to prolong his life. For as long as we’ve had him he’s paced, screamed, pawed and scratched at (open) doors like a caged animal at all hours of the day. 

We started off by taking him on hour long walks outside to see if that helped. It did at first, but then he transitioned to yowling at the door on top of everything else. We tried getting a second cat to keep him company and play with, which again, worked for a while but then he started up almost worse than before. We then took him to the vet and did some tests including stool/urine samples to see if anything was agitating him and that came back clear. We didn’t give up and kept trying. My husband built him a full sized catio so he can be outside and play whenever he wants, but he mostly ignores it. We got a third kitten (a foster fail) and had our fingers crossed she would help because she’s so playful, but again he went back to his tendencies. On top of that all, these cats have more toys and litterbox choices to choose from than they could ever want.

Right now it genuinely feels like we’re raising a defiant child. He keeps us up at all hours of the night yowling and pawing at doors, we can’t sit on the couch and watch tv without him knocking everything off the coffee table. We’re at our wits end. We’ve genuinely discussed if Murphy is a Russian cat spy trained to see how much steady torture we can tolerate. 

We love him so much, he’s our first pet we got together and he’s bonded so closely with us we’d never dream of giving him up. Every year people keep telling us “oh he’ll calm down soon” and every year it seems like it just escalates.

We’re contemplating air tagging him, opening the door and letting him roam to his hearts content. The only issue is this cat isn’t winning any Darwin awards. My husband has had to scoop him out of the street on walks after he’s dashed in front of cars. He thinks dogs are his best friends (including the time he ended up in the mouth of a German Shepard!). So we’re worried the second we open the door unsupervised we’ll lose our little buddy.

Does anyone have any advice? We’ve done the medical route, opened up his access to the outside, provide him with plenty of stimulating toys and he has playmates now so we’re really at a loss. Any help is so appreciated!

1qi9x8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/cronometer/comments/1qi9x8r/how_to_make_the_most_of_cronometers_diary_groups/,How to Make the Most of Cronometer's Diary Groups,"If you're not customizing your diary groups, you're probably missing out on one of the most powerful free features in the app. It helps you organize your food log by meals or time blocks, analyze your macros by group, and spot patterns that can improve how you eat, feel, and fuel.

This feature used to be part of Cronometer Gold but has been free since 2024 (what app actually pushes more features to free than putting behind a paywall these days?!. Here's a breakdown of how to use it, plus a few pro tips from coaching hundreds of clients through this tool.

# How to Set Up & Customize Diary Groups

1. On the lower right of the app, tap **More**
2. Go to **Display** → then **Diary Settings**
3. Toggle ON **Show Groups**
4. Expand the **Diary Groups** section and turn on up to 8 groups

# Why It Matters

When you organize your diary into multiple groups, it gives you real insight into:

* When you're over- or under-eating
* Which meals lack protein or balance
* Whether you're spreading calories & macro goals in a way that supports your energy and goals

Many people finally recognize that when they eat a 300-calorie breakfast, it usually leads to becoming a snack tornado at 4 pm. Grouping lets you see these patterns clearly.

# Pro Tips to Get the Most Out of Your Groups

**1. Turn on Macros per Meal**

Under **Show Group Subtotals**, select 'macronutrients'. You’ll see the **calories, protein, carbs, and fat totals** for each meal group. This makes it easier to:

* Hit protein goals per meal
* Avoid backloading calories at night
* Understand how your energy intake is distributed

**2. Display Calories per Food Item**

In Display Settings, you can also change the Summary Column to show calories, protein, carbs, fiber, etc. I personally keep it on calories, because it quickly tells me:

* What’s making up the bulk of a meal
* Whether I'm hitting an 80/20 balance (real food vs treats)

If you’re working on a specific target like fiber or protein, switch the column to match.

**3. Max Out All 8 Groups**

You get up to 8, **use them**, even if you don’t fill them every day. This helps:

* Separate meals and snacks throughout the day
* Track intra-workout fuel (perfect for performance athletes!)
* Flag trends (like alcohol intake or late-night snacking)
* Keep synced biometrics (like Garmin/scale data) in a separate section so it doesn’t clutter your food log (**Pro Tip:** make this your *last* diary group so that your top of feed isn't as bogged down)

# Example Meal Group Layouts:

**For Shift Workers:**

Forget breakfast/lunch/dinner — that doesn’t make sense when you’re flipping between days and nights. Use time blocks instead:

* 12am–4am
* 4am–8am
* 8am–Noon
* Noon–4pm
* 4pm–8pm
* 8pm–Midnight

**For Goal-Setting Per Meal:**

Some people label each group with their **macro or calorie goal** instead of just meal names:

* Snack: 10g protein & 200 cal
* Breakfast: 30g & 600 cal
* Lunch: 40g & 600 cal
* Dinner: 40g & 600 cal

This makes it obvious when a meal falls short or overshoots the target blueprint.

**The Layout I use:**

* Morning Coffee (2 lattes a day forever 😅)
* Breakfast
* Morning Snacks / Intraworkout
* Lunch
* Afternoon Snacks
* Dinner
* Supplements
* Sync'd Data

# Bonus Tip: Use the Swipe Menu

When you swipe a meal group and tap the three dots, you unlock a ton of helpful features:

* Copy yesterday’s group to today
* Create a recipe or meal from that group
* View all micronutrients for the meal (great for checking fiber or sodium)
* Reorder items, add timestamps, or delete the group

You don’t need to use these daily, but they can save you serious time if you eat similarly from day to day.

# TLDR: Make It Work for You

There’s no one “right” way to use Diary Groups. But if you’re not using them at all, *or not fully*, you’re likely missing opportunities to improve how you feel and how you fuel.

You’re not *just* tracking your food, you’re learning about yourself so that you can adjust as needed. So set up your diary groups to give you feedback that matters:

* Is this meal balanced?
* Am I fueling enough for my activities?
* Which meal do I need to tweak to increase protein?

Your data is only as useful as the picture it paints, and diary groups help give you the clearest picture possible.

What did I do wrong?","I (24F) moved to the Netherlands for my education. I live in an international dormitory about 7 km from my university, and I mostly spend time with other international students from the dorm.

There’s a guy (22M) in our larger friend group. Neither of us is really into clubbing, but one night we went to a club together with friends. After a while, I got bored and asked him if he could accompany me back to the dorm. He agreed.

This was the first time we were ever alone together. When we reached our bikes, he told me that he liked me more than the others in the group. I told him I liked him more too. Then he mentioned a small pub nearby where he usually goes alone and asked if I wanted to have a drink before heading back. I said I was really tired, and he said “okay.”

After we cycled back to the dorm, he asked if I wanted to join him for a short walk to the lake right behind the dorm. I declined again, and we said goodbye.

I didn’t see him for the next few days. About a week later, I was sitting outside the dorm drinking coffee when he came by with his tea. It was a sunny day which is pretty rare in the Netherlands around this time of year. He sat next to me and we talked, but nothing felt special or flirty.

Before going to class, he said he wanted to go to the lake to take some photos. We went there together, but he seemed distant and uninterested in me. I played some music on my phone and sat next to him on a bench, then stood by the fence. I honestly thought he wanted us to be alone so he could make a move.

Instead, he suddenly said, “I have to go now.” I turned to look at him, and he just waved and said “bye.” I said “bye” too.

1qi9s4f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qi9s4f,Grand Hyatt Scottsdale Review,"I just spent a few days at Grand Hyatt Scottsdale and was very impressed by the property. They recently went through a renovation and personally, I think it's one of the better renovations that I've ever seen. The buildings and landscaping look great. The furnishings are contemporary and everything seems to somehow straddle the modern aesthetic with the surrounding southwest vibe. The entrance with expansive lobby, bar and view set the tone. My room was a standard King. The space, layout and furnishings were well thought out and implemented. The small loveseat pulls out to a single bed which makes this arrangement perfect for a family of 3. The AC worked great and the temperature was very comfortable. The shower water pressure was weak, but there was plenty of hot water and the bathroom was organized well and was spacious. There was plenty of storage with multiple areas of drawers and there was hanging space as you'd expect. Power outlets were abundant. I have a sensitive back and woke up each morning very stiff. I would say their mattresses are not the most comfortable that I've slept on, but for someone not prone to back stiffness, it would probably be fine.

There was a 6 piece band playing Yacht Rock music on Saturday night. They were fabulous and the atmosphere was great. The indoor/outdoor stage and seating was unique. The quality of the hotel's outdoor furniture (mostly Gloster I think) looks great and is comfortable. The acoustics were surprisingly good as well. We ordered the mini sliders and an ahi tuna salad. The tuna lacked any flavor and I'd recommend a pass, but the sliders were good.

Our second day, we had breakfast at the hotel's breakfast restaurant, Mesa Centrale. There was a buffet that was standard fare. We ended up ordering off the menu. My daughter had the blue corn flour pancakes. My wife had the huevos rancheros and I the Mesa breakfast sandwich. Each item was delicious. So much so that the following day we ordered the same exact things. On the second day there was no buffet as it was a Monday, so all breakfast was Ala-carte.

From there, my daughter and wife did rock climbing on their wall. They charge $7 per person to climb twice, but whatever. My daughter enjoyed it, so we did it the following day as well. 

We spent most of the day at the pool area which is a highlight. There are several pools near one another. One has a sandy beach which we spent most of our lounge time at. The corkscrew waterslide was also a hit. The adults only pool was really nice with its own swanky bar area. When we sat down, we were immediately greeted and given cups and a pitcher of water. Service was very affable, if a little slow at times. Food to feed the Koy fish was complimentary and a fun diversion. I had initially planned to get a cabana, but the prices were $675/day for the standard cabana and $800 for a larger one. In the end I decided against reserving one. I feel like I made the right choice three fold. First, I don't know who what the occupancy the hotel was at, but the pool area is expansive, with a lots of room and lots of chaise lounges. Even at its peak, there was probably only about 50% of the chaise lounges occupied. The cabanas were maybe 20% occupied. And the ones that were, had people who seemed to have no interested in the pool and were just watching playoff football. The second reason is that I would have reserved a smaller cabana, but this would have been a poor value. They have a single sofa inside with TV and refrigerator and two of the standard chaise lounges outside. The larger grand cabanas would well be worth the extra $125 spend for 2-3 times the space and comfort. Personally, I think it's a shame that places charge so much only to have 80% of them unoccupied. Lastly, the weather happened to be perfect, 75 degrees, dry and sunny. We didn't really need the shade. There are lots of umbrellas around the chaise lounges, but I can imagine when it's 120 degree, you need more consistent shade than an umbrella provides. The pool temperature was nice although I wouldn't have complained if it were 1-2 degrees warmer. Food at the pool was pretty good. We had the fresh fruit plate which was very good. The tacos al pastor were above average for pool fare and the bulgogi fries with kim chi were pretty good as well. The cocktails were expected resort prices, but good.

The Grand Club for globalists is small. They check your status (from prior reviews, it seems they didn't when it initially opened) upon entry. The food options are very limited, but you can grab a can of Bubly or other N/A drink any time. They have wine and beer for purchase at the standard hotel rate I believe. The first day my wife had a glass of Pino that they should have paid us to drink rather than the other way around.

The gym was nice/adequate and located adjacent to the spa and near the tennis/pickle facilities.

I was staying as a globalist on award/points, so parking and resort fees were complimentary, but for those that may be considering a stay outside of globalist status, the fee is $35 I believe for self and $45 for valet. There is also a $50 resort fee.

I really like this resort, but it is not without its faults. I already mentioned the cabanas, but I don't really count that against them as it's their pricing prerogative and it's easy and upfront to know the cost. But, I do take issue with the fact that when I checked out, I noticed that I was charged $129 for breakfast one day (the other day didn't show up at all). I called up the hotel and the person who answered, told me that they made a mistake, and there is a $30 per person credit for globalists. That would leave a balance of about $40 for which I would be responsible. I explained that I didn't think that was right and it was the first I'd heard about it. I eventually spoke with the manager who really leaned into the ""this is a Resort property and we are exempt from standard globalist benefits."" She said that they should have told me this at check in. I explained that I didn't receive this information about the $30 breakfast credit. In fact, I was told that breakfast was at the Mesa restaurant and that was it. I'm always keen at check in to listen so I understand this kind of information, spa amenities, room upgrades, etc. I also told her that it seemed strange that I was only charged for one day even though I ate at the restaurant both days. I certainly was not asking to be charged for the other day, but it was weird nonetheless. She grudgingly said they would comp the remainder of the breakfast charge. I thanked her. I do think that this deserves a little more nuanced discussion. First, each of us ordered one entre item and one coffee or juice. These are not the most expensive items on the menu. Each is $24-26. The coffee/juice is $8 I believe. I wrote ""globalist"" under tip as I believed that my breakfast was complimentary and that Hyatt usually reimburses the servers 18%. They did indeed charge me for 18% gratuity, and thus the bill for 3 people ordering a fairly regular breakfast comes to almost $130. It's disingenuous to say you provide complimentary breakfast to globalists if ordering a standard items off the menu will undoubtedly result in exceeding the allowance. I don't mean to say that $30 is not a good subsidy, but you can't have it both ways. You can't tell globalists that their breakfast is complimentary, guide them to the restaurant (which a preliminary email they send out before the stay also says without any mention of the limited monetary credit) and then charge rates too high to be completely covered. Again, the breakfast was very good, but at the end of the day, it was an egg sandwich, pancakes and huevos rancheros with coffee and juice. I really hope that this kind of behavior doesn't become common with ""resort"" properties. I am a Hyatt loyalist really only for my leisure travel stays.

My only other disappointment was that I was limited to a 1:30PM checkout. Once again, they seemed to lean into, if not relish the fact that they are a ""Resort"" property. I knew this and was already familiar with the fact that it is based on availability and their discretion without them having to tell me several times. Each and every interaction that I had was very professional and courteous, so I don't want it to come off as if they were snooty. That was absolutely not the case. Regardless, this was probably the first time that I've been denied a checkout of at least 2PM. It wasn't a big deal, but the extra time would have let us have a little more relaxing mid day by the pool. We probably would have eaten lunch again by the pool as well instead of leaving earlier and dining off site.

My last thoughts are that Scottsdale is a lot like the Palm Springs area with the similar weather, similar mountains painting the background, similar high end shopping and restaurant around, etc. My natural comparison is Grand Hyatt Indian Wells. For those who may read this and be considering both properties, I'd say that GH Scottsdale feels a little more posh both in the hotel itself as well as the pool area. I'd put the hard product of GH Scottsdale a lot closer to Park Hyatt territory than GH Indian Wells. They both have expansive properties with casitas dotting the outskirts. Both have golf and tennis facilities. Breakfast at GH Indian Wells is a little more creative and overall better in my opinion. Service is probably a push. Indian Well is an amazing location for BNP Paribas tennis stays as well as Cochella. I'm a lot closer to Palm Springs, so I'll probably stay more often at GH IW, but if they were equidistant from my home, I'd probably lean Scottsdale.",18,1768935036.0,hyatt,2,1.0,False

As he woke up and looked around the room, he noticed a strange energy. Not the supernatural kind, but the one you feel just before a family member dies, or the one in your gut that compels you into taking a different road home. But this was bigger, more intense than he had ever felt. It was as if the whole world had changed, overnight. He got out of bed, noticing the cold wooden floor beneath his feet as he put on his work clothes. He walked downstairs into the living room and turned on the morning news. But there was just static buzzing trough the speakers and a distorted image that resembled some type of warning signal. He tried hitting the television box, but to no avail. He took out his phone, no signal. “What the hell?” He muttered, he checked the time on his phone, 3:50 AM, something wasn't right, he checked the clock on the microwave, 3:50..

Had he woken to early? He opened the front door, it was sunny and warm. “The clocks must have gotten hung up”, he thought. He stood outside, listening for life but it was dead quiet, no people, animals or even cars from the highway just a few hundred meters away from him. He started walking around the neighborhood, looking for anyone. Surely the parents would be awake dragging their kids to the car so they could get to school by now? Had there maybe been some emergency he hadn't heard and everyone had left? Maybe, but why were all the cars still in the driveways, even the lights were on in everyones houses. He tried knocking at the Wilson family's house. He walked around their house looking trough the windows, their TV was on. But it showed the same buzzing signal as his. He felt a knot in his chest, neither anxiety nor fear, just empty anticipation.

He got back to his house and brewed a cup of coffee, two shots espresso, one part milk and a splash of honey. Most people didn't like that mix but to Jay it was his light in a otherwise soulless world. For ten minutes, he just sat there, staring out the window hoping to see someone or something going by, but nothing, not even a bird or a bumblebee showed up.

Jay was a little hesitant to go back outside but he figured there had to be some kind of explanation, so he picked up his car keys and backed out of the driveway. He took the road towards town, a fifteen minute drive. Trough habit he turned on the radio but a disgusting hiss hit his ears, as if someone had recorded themselves dragging their fingernails over a chalkboard and put it on loop. He played with the frequency but only got the same hiss but of different tones and patterns. He switched it of and drove onto the highway, it was almost completely empty except for a car here and there parked in the middle of the way, he didn't care to slow down but peeked trough his window to see if anyone was inside.



He reached town and slowed for the red light, not that there was any reason to, there wasn't anyone there to even see him running it. But he had swore himself to practice healthy driving habits after his brother was killed by a drunk driver seven years ago. He waited, and waited, but the light never changed, he figured something was wrong with the electrical signals in the whole of Adamsville and against his better judgement slowly drove trough the light. 

After eight more stuck red lights and three stuck green lights he arrived at Adamsville P.D.

He parked his car and turned the ignition of, he sat still for a moment, the knot tightening.

He opened the door and as he slammed it shut he heard something, a loud ticking sound, 

click clack, click clack, click clack. Like an old grandfather clock. It ticked for what felt like forever before it stopped and he heard a static background noise, he turned his head trying to locate where it came from, but it seemed like it was from everywhere, inside, outside, the sky, the ground it all “buzzed” in a noise similar to when you put your finger on an AUX jack connected to some large speakers.



He froze again, with his mind going completely blank as he stared straight into the abyss, time froze, or well it felt like it. Then he had the realization, “Oh my God, I'm dead”, his mind began to wither and he his eyes started leaking, he hadn't even though about his family, yet with his mortal recognition they were his first thought. “This must be the afterlife, but why am I alone? Where is everyone else?”, he thought of his brother, maybe he is here, somewhere, or maybe he is alone too? He began feeling nauseous and feeling like his world had just collapsed, which under the circumstances it quite literally had. He started coming back, the background noise still going.

He opened the dash in his car. He looked for the image of his brother which he always kept in a wooden frame made from Sakura, his brothers favorite tree, he had visited Japan every year in the blossoming period to see them, he even had a tree of his own in the bedroom so he could see it every morning.

He located the picture and blew of some dust and candy wrappers stuck to it. He felt his heartbeat slowing, the picture was taken in 1993 at the bowling alley they always went to as kids, on the back of the frame, written in his mothers cursive “Jay and Joseph, Clownfest Bowlingalley 1993”. He turned the frame again to look at his brothers face, but noticed something wasn't right, the face  of Joseph was washed out, as if a smudge was on the lens when the picture was taken, he tried rubbing the glass and even taking the picture out of the frame blowing moisture at it and gently rubbing, but nothing, it looked as if Joseph never was in the picture. Jay felt his eyes tearing up again, he tried to picture Joseph, but came to a harrowing realization. He couldn't, no matter how hard he tried, he could not remember the slightest detail about Joseph, it was as if he was simply written out of existence. “When you die your body may disappear, but the memory is what remains, but what if even that gets lost? Is he just a ghost of the past? Someone who simply appeared in a frame of time only to disappear with no trace? What if that is what happens to me now? What if its like I never existed?” Jays mind was going numb, he closed his eyes, trying to focus on his breath and calm himself down. He sat still for a while trying, his absolute hardest, to remember something.

He opened his eyes, facing the windshield when he noticed a small crack, he ran his fingers over it, feeling the ridges of the cracked glass. “Where did that come from?” He thought.

Suddenly the crack started spreading until it covered all of his windshield, then as if his soul was jerked out of his body he remembered something, a faint memory, he was standing on the street, it was cold outside, his warm breath creating thick smoke. Cigarette in his hand, halfway burned. He looked to his right, a car was speeding down the road, time slowed down, it got closer and closer, time was practically still, but not the car, it was still in full speed. He felt himself sweating, but not warmly, it was cold, the drops of his sweat almost freezing when they came out of his skin. The headlights got bigger, brighter, closer. And before he knew it he snapped back into his head.

“What the hell? When was that?” He thought, “was that how I died?” Jay sat there, completely dumfounded, “But I never even smoked, except for that one time at the school trip when he was 16, but that was just because he wanted to be cool, like his brother. He took one puff and coughed so hard he thought his lungs would come out. So he never did it again.

This had all gotten him off track, he needed to figure out what was going on, where everyone was and if he really is dead then where is all the dead people? Surely it should be packed here.

He got out of the car and started walking up the stairs, each step feeling heavier and heavier until he was at the top. There was lights on inside here too, he walked to the doors hoping it wasn't locked, and to his astonishment the doors opened automatically, he slowly creeped inside, “Hello?” He called out, but it was even quieter than outside. From the ceiling a screen was hanging, showing the number 46, meaning the last person they served in the reception was 46. “Strange, these reset everyday after midnight, and the reception closes at eight in the evening and opens at 8:30, so theres no way someone was served, unless everyone disappeared some time after 8:30.

Jay began looking around the station, there was a wall with ongoing cases and general information for police staff. “4 year old girl, GONE MISSING”, “strange, I remember that one, but she was found in a forest over 7 years ago, why do they still have the poster up?” He said to himself. He walked into a hallway where the lights had gone out, so he took out his phone and turned the flashlight on, he opened one of the doors and found room with three holding cells. They were all empty except for one that had a green and yellow sweater laying on the metal bench. He found it a bit amusing, the sweater looked exactly like on he had owned many years ago, they didn't make those anymore, the company had gone bankrupt after investing all their money into some shady ripoff they were planning to become a part of. Jay hadn’t thought of that sweater in years, but then he had a flicker of a memory, just an image in his mind of him holding the sweater. Nothing dramatic but the atmosphere of it was clear, and all of a sudden the amusement turned into a cold shiver from his head to his toes. He wasn't sure he even wanted to touch it but he saw a pair of keys laying on a desk, next to a photo of some random lady and a official police department ballpoint pen. He grabbed the keys and opened the cell door, he picked up the shirt and held it up straight, there was blood stains on the front, it was smeared and the shape of it looked similar to Italy. He tossed the sweater, but something fell out of its pocked, a small paper. He picked it up, it was a slip of paper with the number 46 on it. Jay didn't think much of it and just crumpled it and tossed it onto the sweater. 

The nauseating feeling was creeping back, a tightness in his throat was choking him. He needed some fresh air, hyperventilating and sweating he stumbled out of the police station. He sat down at a  nearby bench trying to make everything make sense, the clocks, the hiss, the buzz, the poster, the sweater and the memories. He remembered something his brother had told him after coming back from a trip to Asia, something about “a state of Limbo”, he had a name for it though, “Balo? Brado?” He was trying to remember but it was hard when he couldn't really remember anything about his brother, he had always had great visualization skills, it was how he usually remembered stuff, but when he could put himself in a scene properly it was almost impossible. He needed answers and decided to go to the Library. It was only two blocks away, but he still wanted to take the car, just incase he needed to get away quickly, from what he wasn't sure. He sat for a little while longer, until the noose loosened and his stomach wasn't trying to eat itself anymore.

The stairs down felt better now, he walked to the car and was about to get in when he looked at the windshield again, it was still broken, it would be practically impossible to drive in it, so he decided to just walk instead. He took the picture from the dashboard, with his brother still washed out and grabbed his work backpack from the trunk incase he needed to carry anything. The trunk slammed shut and he started walking the direction of the Library. While walking he notoriously looked inside stores, restaurants and cafes for some sign of life. The stores was still packed with fresh groceries, apples, meat, everything still in there as if it was just restocked. The restaurants and cafes even had food put out on different tables, in one of the restaurants “Gil´s Diner”, there was even a plate of spaghetti which was still warm, there was a nice smell of baked bread and spices whiffing trough the air, for a second he forgot he was alone and felt like it was just another Friday evening where he was going out to eat.

In the cafe there was a pot, still half full of steaming hot coffee, he was getting exhausted and opened his backpack where he fumbled around and found his termos. He poured out yesterdays coffee, or whatever the day before this was. The termos was now filled with fresh new coffee, hinting with notes of cinnamon and walnuts. The coffee wasn't unpleasant either, not what he would normally choose, Jay preferred a more bold taste, with coffee brewed for at least 2 minutes instead of the 30 second quickies they make here. Still, better than nothing. He kept walking, sipping his coffee along the way.

Jay was nearing the library when he found himself getting close to an intersection, he stopped, staring at it with empty eyes, the atmosphere getting murky and time slowing down. He was at the intersection where Joseph died.







Chapter 2 “The discovery”

Jay was slowly coming back to his senses, the silence came back, the sun rays hitting his eyes, the warm moist breeze drifting over his skin. He found himself slowly walking backwards away from the intersection, he hadn't been there since the night it happened, even though it was on his way to work he took a longer route just to avoid it. He kept moving further away, but as he got further and further a strong pull felt like it was dragging him back to it, like when you hold two magnets close to each other and feel them pulling except the further he pulled it apart the stronger they tried to close in. It started getting physically harder to walk away, like he was wearing a backpack which slowly filled with water. The noose was tightening around his neck again and his stomach was trying to digest itself, he tried to fight it but it got worse and worse, his sight began to fade and his ears started ringing. There was no other way, he had to go towards it, but why? Was he being tormented by a sadistic god? Was it a sick prank of some metaphysical being trying to break him? Why did he have to go there if he didn't want to? He hadn't done anything wrong.

He was closer now, closer than he had ever been since Joseph died. He felt an overwhelming sense of sadness, a feeling of dread, the reopening of a wound that never fully closed.

Then he remembered something, another flicker of memories, he saw it again his brother standing in the cold December night, on the street. The car hitting him. Everything froze for a minute, the atoms completely still, the air sucked out into the vacuum of space. He walked over to the car, which was completely frozen, yet he heard the engine going, the speedometer stuck on 87kmh.

He looked at the man in the car, he was blurred out, just like Joseph was in the picture. Yet he felt a strange connection, as if a memory had suddenly separated from its host. He went over to the passenger seat, and opened the door, he sat down and looked around. The only sound he heard was the engine of the car, and the engine beating in his chest. He hadn't noticed before he got into the car how cold the outside was, there was snow on the ground, it was nighttime. Everything slowly started moving again, like a slow defrost in a microwave where only the outside got warm yet the inside was still unreachable, still cold, still trapped. He decided to get out of the car before time got to fast, but before he stepped out he noticed something. The digital clock, on the dashboard. 

3:50..



Jay was outside the entrance of the library now, when the loud ticking started again.

Tick. Tack. 

Tick. Tack. 

Tick

BUZZ—

The buzz was stronger than the last time, it had a more distorted feel to it as if the signal was bad, so someone turned the volume up to compensate. It hit like a shockwave, his heart stopping for a second. He didn't understand, where, what and why the ticking meant. He felt a vibration coming from his phone, he tapped the screen. 3:52. All this time, only 2 minutes had gone by, he felt the accustomed sensation of confusion again, but quickly brought himself back, if time *was* moving, there must be a reason it was so slow, and a reason the time started at his brothers moment of death, at least roughly, he had been pronounced dead at 4:00 when the ambulance arrived.

He put down the phone, when he he heard something, something familiar, a faint sound of police sirens, not from a specific location, more from a setting, a scene from which the sound came from. But he isn't in the audience. 

He *is* the actor.



The door to the library creaked open, like the sound your door made when you were a kid trying to sneak out but the silence decided to tell on you. Jay walked inside, the smell of old and new books hit his nose, familiar, old and sad. So many books, so many lives, written down on thin paper sheets outliving its makers. Jay stopped to admire the library, it was one of his favorite places, (besides the bowling alley of course) it was where he went when he just needed a break from his own life. Reading books allowed him to live trough someone other than himself. He could be a wizard, a expert spy, a dragon slaying warrior. He could pick up a book, and experience grief, joy, hollowness, anything really, the possibilities was endless. He ran his fingers over one of the books in the “old” section of the library, 1960-1980. You see the library had actually been there for over 300 years, so many books from the 16 and 17th century was well preserved.

The book was still in fair condition, it had been refurbished several times, or at least the cover, because some teens had been vandalizing a couple years ago, drawing graffiti like images on the covers. It was replaced with a beautiful golden plate, made from an actual slice of metal. It was cold, fingerprints smeared over it. “Crab Junior, Seven Days In The Ocean”. It was about a plane, which had crashed into the Atlantic Sea during the Cold War. A hundred prisoners and several guards onboard, the plane had sunk because the underside where the cargo was stored, got filled with water. However the cabin had survived the crash and the ones who lived trough the initial impact survived on the sea floor before being rescued. He was intrigued by how the crew, guards and prisoners had actually worked together to ensure as many as possible survived. It reminded him that all people can change, even the murderers had worked together with their capturers, they had faced their crimes and trauma. After 7 days they were rescued and they had better progress than what similar people had with years of therapy.



He kept walking around, trough the “Crime” section, the “Drama” and the “Non-Fiction”.

He wasn't sure where to look honestly, books about religion and the afterlife wasn't something he ever even considered reading. He wasn't even sure he believed in God, at least not anymore, being trapped in this eery place.

He began walking in circles, looking for anything he had missed, a word kept replaying in his mind, “Balo, Bardor”, but not the correct word, just the tip of my tongue type word. He knew it, but it was locked away somewhere.



“Finally”, he said as he found the small section of religious and spiritual books. It was barely a section, it was on the bottom of the section for “Around The World”.

He crouched down, scanning the titles on the sides. “The Bible”, “KJV Bible”, “Christian Ways Of Living And Praying”, “The Quran”. 

This was not what he was looking for, he kept scanning, when he saw a drawer on the bottom of the shelf. He pulled it out and his eyes lit up like a kid on Christmas morning. “The Kybalion”, “Hermetic Teachings”, and then he saw it, “The Tibetan Book Of The Dead”. He grabbed it as quickly as he could, laughing at the irony, as if someone else would grab it before him. He found a chair in one of the corners, a coffee cup and a half eaten croissant still on the table in front of him.

After brushing the crumbs of and putting the cup on the ground beside him, he laid the book down.

He flipped trough the pages, which were thicker than normal books, suddenly he saw it.

“Bardo”. 

A feeling of relief rushed over him, the feeling of your mind finally revealing the name of the song you have had on your mind all week.

He read a small section,



*“The Bardo, a place of existence between life and death. A gap in which an individual goes trough transformation and processing.*

*Often experienced by individuals with unprocessed trauma, fear or unfinished work.”*





Chapter 3 “Unresponsive Processing”

After reading more passages Jay finally understood where he was. He wasn't dead, but he wasn't alive either, he was both. Stuck in a holding place, Bardo, Limbo, Processing room, whatever you wanna call it.

He continued searching trough the book, a holding place, it couldn't be permanent right? There had to be some way to be released.



*“As an individual in Bardo begins processing their trauma, they will need to accept it and let go of all that is holding them back. When full liberation and realization is achieved the individual will transcend to a higher realm of existence.”*



Suddenly Jay felt like he was drowning, “trauma, realization?” What did he have to process? He had lived a normal life, working as a plumber, trying to do his best for society. Could it be that he didn't have a wife and kids? But that should be his choice, he was fairly happy with his life. At least, well, before 7 years ago. But he had done all he could about it, he went to a shrink once a week. He exercised, tried to keep his mind occupied to escape the grief. “Wait, that may be it”, he thought.

“I always escaped the grief, always shutting the door behind me when it was chasing me.” He muttered.

“But still, what would being here do? I mean, fine I accept it.” Jay said out loud, his voice breaking.

He fell to his knees, “HE IS DEAD, OKAY? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR? MY BROTHER IS DEAD, BUT ITS NOT MY FAULT, SO WHY AM I BEING TORMENTED?”, Jay screamed into the still air, his voice bouncing off the stone walls before it got silent again. He yelled again, and again until his vocal cords almost snapped. He felt a burning sensation in his whole body, it got stronger and stronger until he felt like he would catch fire, the hair on his arms raised, his muscles flexed and he put his hands on the rough wooden floor, a splinter piercing his finger. He started weeping, in a broken voice he said, “he is dead, my beautiful brother, is dead”, his head touched the floor.



Jay was still crouched over with his head on the ground when he heard it again, the ticking.

More intense than the last time, the whole building was shaking with each tick. Dust particles fell from the shelves, the walls started to crack. Jay panicked, “This whole building is collapsing” his trembling thoughts screamed. Jay grabbed his backpack and ran towards the stairwell, he ran down as fast as he could and just as he was about to open the door he stumbled over something and fell and hit his head.

He passed out.

As he woke up he had another flicker of memory. It was the intersection again, but this time he wasn't on the street, he was behind the wheel. He felt dizzy, almost drunk, he figured it was because his head banged up. His hands gripping the leather on the steering wheel, he couldn't see clearly. The car swerved by a cafe, a restaurant then a red light. Following was a loud crash, his windshield smashed up, he had slammed into his face. Then he was pulled out by another crashing sound, the building, it was collapsing.

Jay barely got out, a wooden plank landed on his ankle just as he was about to exit, the pain was immense, the dust and smoke from the collapse surrounded him, filling his lungs making the choking sensation physical, he managed to drag himself further away until the only dust that was near him was that which was covering his clothes. He pulled his pants up, checking his ankle, it was blue and a big bump was forming under the skin. He got up and tested if it was broken. He took a few steps, it was fine as long as he stepped down on his toes instead of heel. 



He sat down on the ground, waiting, for what he wasn't entirely sure. He hoped he was done here, that he would be pulled up towards “heaven”. But nothing happened, only static noise now even louder. But something had changed, the buildings looked different, the library was collapsed obviously but all the other buildings, it looked like it was from a different time, the street lights were of an older type, the cars was different, the pizza shop across the street was, gone? At least not a pizza shop anymore. It was a butcher shop, just like it was when, “Oh my God”, Jay thought. He quickly grabbed his phone. “22. December 2018”. He dropped his phone, the screen shattering. He was back, this was the day Joseph died. Jay didn't know what to feel, dread, happiness, excitement? So many feelings pumped trough his bodies in sync with his heartbeat. “Could Joseph be here?” He though.

Jay started running, completely forgetting about the pain in his foot. He ran, just as fast as he did when he and Joseph used to race. 

He turned the corner.

And there he was at the end of the block, Joseph.

“JOSEEEPH”, Jay screamed. “OH-MY-GOD, I CANT BELIEVE ITS YOU, IVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH”. Tears filling his eyes.

But Joseph didn't respond, he just stood there.

“Joseph?” Jay yelled, getting closer.

His face, was still washed out. It was him obviously, but why could he see his face?

A few meters away from Joseph, he began hearing a familiar noise. A car, getting closer and closer, tires rolling on the ground, engine getting louder and louder. Jay understood what was about to happen, he tried moving, but he was stuck, his body completely frozen in the moment. He tried to yell, “JOSEPH GET OUT OF THE WAY”, but no sound came out.

“No-no-no, please, let me save him, ILL TAKE HIS SPOT, KILL ME INSTEAD”.

The car got closer, and closer, Joseph looked up right before impact and everything froze. The air vibrated in anticipation, the moment, just before a life is taken and you know there is no going back. An inevitable end, to something and someone. Then everything got dark, more dark than black and suddenly Jay found himself in the driving seat again. Memories came flooding back, the car, the cracked windshield, the sweater, the blood.

The airbag shot out on impact again, the car screeched to a stop. Jay opened the car door, his knees almost too weak to carry him, his vision, blurred. Everything got quiet, then it all came back, the sounds. People taking, cars driving, highway, birds. He saw someone laying on the ground, he ran towards him. There was a face, a face which he know all to well. His brother, lying on the ground, the stars reflecting in his eyes. Joseph looked at him, Jay grabbed him, he put his chest towards his, getting blood all over his sweatshirt. Jay put him down, holding his hand could feel their pulse syncing together, until they didn't. Josephs was slowing and a single tear formed in the corner of his eye.

He looked straight into Jays soul and whispered. “Never forget.”

Then silence. Silence so sharp it cuts straight trough you.

Jay looked into his eyes again, the stars disappearing, life disappearing. He wasnt here to realize he killed him, he was here to remember him, to never forget him.",1,1768935032.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

Middle note: Vanilla.  Base: Vanilla, Sugar and Ambergris. I love coffee and boozy scents to I picked up for about $20.

 I have to say I love this. I pick up the Amaretto and Coffee right away. It then develops to a sweet Vanilla with hints of the coffee and booze lingering a bit as it dries down. However it is not a cloying or overwhelming scent as other sweet vanilla fragrances can be which I really appreciate. 

As far as performance, its ok. I've tracked about 2 to 3 hours projection and about 6 to 7 hours on skin. Definitely something that has gotten better over time after maceration. Overall not the beast mode or hugely overwhelming projection some people seek, definitely more of a close up scent. 

Overall I'd give this an 8/10. If you enjoy sweet coffee and boozy scents without the very harsh, headache inducing sweetness to get from other gourmand fragrances you'll enjoy this. Especially if you can find it for under $30. Its very pleasant and very easy to wear fall and winter fragrance. ",3,1768934526.0,fragranceclones,1,1.0,False
