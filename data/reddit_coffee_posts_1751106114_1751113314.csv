I’m the type who overthinks a bit too much and gets easily swept up in small things. Lately I’ve been reading a lot of poetry, especially ghazals, and going on long walks just observing life. I’ll stare at an old wall and wonder what it’s witnessed over the years. There’s something comforting about things that are worn, lived in, and full of quiet stories. Also, I like dimmed orange-tinted lights way more than those sterile bright ones.

We don’t have a board, so ideally somewhere that already has chess boards you can use. A lot of the chess cafes we’ve seen seem a bit pricey or more for proper tournaments. We’re just looking for chilled places that are affordable and casual.

He hasn’t had a secure full time job in years. He started a business that isn’t really taking off and he spends most of his days sitting home doing nothing acting like he’s on his phone looking for business. He has maybe 2-3 jobs a month that I guess makes him enough money to pay the house bills because we have electric and water every month but I know he hasn’t paid his credit card bills (I say his because we never had shared cards and his cards were really ever used for himself, not our family) in a very long time and is over $30k in debt. I know it sounds like I’m bashing him but I’m not I’m just confused and need opinions 

I know he pays our car insurance, phones, house utilities and house taxes every month. We don’t have a car payment or rent/mortgage because we live in a house his dad owns and he lets us stay here if we pay taxes/utilities

Im a stay at home mom and I homeschool our kids. I also have a small business on the side that I make decent money doing. I pay for all the food in the house, household items, clothing. Pretty much everything in the house, everything we need and everything our kids need.

Our house is falling apart. We need a new refrigerator because the freezer part is broken. Our car is 20 years old and I tell him all the time I don’t feel safe in it. And it’s falling apart and my kids are embarrassed to be seen in it.

## key Features Analysis

The best coffee scented candles in 2025 offer a blend of high-quality ingredients and innovative design to deliver a realistic and long-lasting aromatic experience.

**Wax Composition:** The type of wax used in a candle considerably impacts its scent throw and burn time. Soy wax, known for its clean burn and ability to hold fragrance well, is a popular choice.Beeswax, another natural option, offers a subtle honey undertone alongside the coffee scent. Paraffin wax,while less expensive,often produces a stronger scent but can also release more soot. A blend of soy and coconut wax strikes a balance between scent quality, burn time, and environmental friendliness.

the wax composition also influences how evenly the candle burns. Candles with uneven burn patterns can lead to wasted wax and a diminished scent experience. Premium coffee scented candles in 2025 utilize wax blends that ensure an even melt pool, maximizing both the fragrance throw and the candle's lifespan.

**Fragrance Oil Blend:** The quality and composition of the fragrance oils are crucial in achieving an authentic coffee aroma. the best candles use a blend of natural essential oils and synthetic fragrance oils to capture the complex notes of roasted coffee beans. Some blends focus on specific coffee profiles, such as dark roast, espresso, or cappuccino, while others incorporate complementary scents like vanilla, hazelnut, or chocolate to create a richer olfactory experience.

A well-crafted fragrance oil blend will have top, middle, and base notes that unfold gradually over time, mimicking the evolution of a freshly brewed cup of coffee. The concentration of fragrance oils also affects the scent throw, with higher concentrations generally resulting in a stronger and more pervasive aroma.

**burn Time:** Burn time is an important factor to consider when selecting a coffee scented candle. A longer burn time indicates a better value and ensures that the candle can be enjoyed for an extended period. High-quality coffee scented candles in 2025 typically offer a burn time ranging from 40 to 80 hours, depending on the size of the candle and the type of wax used.

Factors such as proper wick trimming and avoiding drafts can significantly extend the burn time of a candle.Candles with multiple wicks tend to burn faster but provide a more intense scent throw.

**Vessel Design:** The vessel that holds the candle contributes to its overall aesthetic appeal and can also influence its performance. Coffee scented candles are often packaged in stylish jars, tins, or ceramic containers that complement the coffee theme. A well-designed vessel will also help to distribute heat evenly and prevent tunneling, ensuring a consistent burn.

Some candles feature reusable vessels that can be repurposed after the candle has burned down, adding to their sustainability. The vessel's material and design should also be considered in terms of safety, ensuring that it is heat-resistant and stable.

Key features of premium coffee scented candles include:

* High-quality wax blend (soy, coconut, or beeswax)
* Realistic and complex fragrance oil blend
* extended burn time (40-80 hours)
* stylish and functional vessel design

## Core Benefits

## FAQs Section

**Are coffee scented candles made with real coffee?**

Most coffee scented candles do not contain real coffee grounds or beans directly mixed into the wax. Rather, they are scented with fragrance oils that are designed to mimic the aroma of coffee.These fragrance oils are typically a blend of natural essential oils and synthetic aroma compounds. Some candle makers might use coffee bean extract in their fragrance oil blend, but it's more common to find synthetic or nature-identical aroma compounds.

**Are coffee scented candles safe for pets and children?**

When using candles around pets and children,it’s critically important to exercise caution. Ensure that the candle is placed in an area where it cannot be easily knocked over or reached by children or pets. Always burn candles in a well-ventilated area to prevent the build-up of smoke or fumes. While coffee scented candles are generally safe, it's important to monitor their use and never leave them unattended. if pets or children show any signs of discomfort or allergic reactions, discontinue use promptly.

**How do I get the best scent throw from my coffee scented candle?**

To maximize the scent throw of your coffee scented candle, start by trimming the wick to ¼ inch before each use. this prevents smoking and promotes a cleaner, more even burn. Allow the candle to burn for at least two hours during the first use to create a full melt pool; this ensures that the wax melts evenly across the surface,releasing the fragrance effectively. Avoid burning candles in drafty areas, as this can cause uneven burning and reduce the scent throw.

My husband is going through a lot of stress with his business and was not as enthusiastic as I would have hoped, despite it being him who wanted to have a baby. He says he is happy, but seems to be more numb.

He is anxious about keeping the baby safe. He doesn't want me to exercise, lift weights, drink more than one coffee a day, eat sushi and any other activity which may harm the baby.

I have a lot of anxiety about my weight and being overweight (I've currently got a healthy BMI) and use exercise to keep things in check. I run semi regularly (completed a half marathon earlier in the year and was planning on running another in a few months time) and go to gym classes every week or two and he wants all that to stop. We recently started going to a personal trainer together and mostly focusing on lifting and he also says that has to stop. This makes me feel anxious, I don't want my weight to get out of control. I have tried showing him guidance that you can keep exercising as you did before but he down plays how active I have been and has told me not to.

I don't want to tell my family yet in case things don't work out and I also don't feel comfortable discussing this type of thing with them anyway.

I feel very depressed and isolated, where can I find support that isn't family or work colleagues?

We love tackling unique design challenges, and this 2nd-floor attic-type space with slanted ceilings was a fantastic project for Style Blast AI. The original room, roughly 15x30 feet with limited natural light, felt dark and needed a fresh perspective. We took the user's vision and elevated it!

Here's a breakdown of what our AI did:

**The Challenge:**

* A long, narrow room with no side windows, making it consistently dark.
* Slanted ceilings adding to the complexity.
* A need for clear division into functional zones (living/TV and music/playroom).
* Desire for lighter walls and improved ambient lighting.
* An outdated rug and overall aesthetic.

**How Style Blast AI Transformed the Space:**

* **Brightened Everything Up:** The AI completely repainted the walls and slanted ceilings with a unified, light, and airy color palette. This instantly amplified the limited natural light and made the room feel significantly more open and inviting.
* **Intelligent Space Division:** To address the ""too long"" feel, our AI strategically placed furniture and rugs to create distinct zones without needing physical dividers. The main area now clearly functions as a cozy living space, while the back half beautifully accommodates a music setup with smart storage solutions.
* **Optimized Lighting:** We removed the single ceiling fan light and introduced multiple recessed light fixtures throughout the ceiling. This provides even, abundant ambient lighting, effectively banishing those dark corners.
* **Modern Furnishings & Storage:** The AI selected a contemporary, comfortable sofa, a sleek coffee table, and an upgraded, plush rug that complements the new light aesthetic. Crucially, it integrated modern, modular storage units along the slanted walls, maximizing usability and organization in challenging areas.
* **Enhanced Functionality:** The piano was retained, and the surrounding area was designed to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing music nook, complete with additional storage for instruments or accessories.

This transformation showcases how Style Blast AI can take even the most ""funky"" spaces and turn them into beautifully designed, functional areas.

We're incredibly proud of this makeover! What do you think of the transformation? Have you tackled similar slanted ceiling challenges?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty and Tongue-in-Cheek Analysis: Stromsgodset vs. Vålerenga (Norwegian Eliteserien)**  
*June 29, 2025 – 17:15 UTC*

**The Setup:**  
Stromsgodset, the hapless underachievers of the Eliteserien, are clinging to the automatic relegation zone like a toddler to a security blanket. Five straight losses have them resembling a deflated balloon at a party. Their new manager, Dag-Eilev Fagermo, is optimistic—probably because he’s still on a high from his morning coffee. Meanwhile, Vålerenga, fresh off two consecutive losses but still clinging to the hope of avoiding the bottom three, is led by Geir Bakke, who’s either a motivational guru or just really good at ignoring the calendar.

**Key Stats & Context:**

* **Stromsgodset**: 5-game losing streak, 0 points in their last 3 matches, and a defensive record that makes a sieve look like Fort Knox.
* **Vålerenga**: 2-game skid but with a stronger attacking edge (1.2 goals per game vs. Stromsgodset’s 0.6). Filip Thorvaldsen, their key playmaker, is a threat to unlock even the most disciplined backlines.
* **Injuries/Updates**: No major absences listed, so Marko Farji (Stromsgodset) and Thorvaldsen (Vålerenga) will likely start.

**Odds Breakdown (Best Available):**

* **Stromsgodset**: +250 (2.5)
* **Vålerenga**: +240 (2.4)
* **Draw**: +375 (3.75)

**Implied Probabilities (Vigorish Adjusted):**

* Stromsgodset: 40%
* Vålerenga: 41.67%
* Draw: 26.67%

**Underdog Win Rate Context:**  
Soccer underdogs win 41% of the time. Vålerenga isn’t the underdog here—they’re the *slight* favorite. But Stromsgodset’s 5-game losing streak? That’s a red flag so bright it could blind a stadium’s floodlights.

**EV Calculation & Best Bet:**

* **Vålerenga’s Implied Probability**: 41.67%
* **Historical Context**: Soccer favorites win \~59% of the time. If Vålerenga’s *actual* chance is closer to 50% (factoring in Stromsgodset’s form), their EV is:
   * **EV** = (0.50 \* 1.4) - (0.50 \* 1) = **+0.20** (per $1 bet).

**Why Vålerenga?**

* **Motivation**: Stromsgodset is already dead last; Vålerenga has more to gain by climbing above the bottom three.
* **Form**: Vålerenga’s 1.2 goals per game vs. Stromsgodset’s 0.6 is a damning stat.
* **Psychology**: New managers often take time to fix things. Fagermo’s optimism is cute, but five losses in a row don’t fix themselves overnight.

**Final Prediction:**  
**Vålerenga 1-0**. A tight, low-scoring affair where Thorvaldsen’s creativity pierces Stromsgodset’s leaky defense.

**Best Bet:**  
**Vålerenga ML at +240 (2.4)**. The EV is positive if you assume their actual win chance is \~50% (vs. 41.67% implied). Even if they’re just a 45% favorite, the split difference (45% vs. 41.67%) gives them a 3.33% edge. In soccer, that’s enough to justify the pick.

**Sarcastic Sign-Off:**  
""May the odds be ever in your favor, Stromsgodset. Oh wait, they’re not. You’re the team that lost five in a row. Enjoy your relegation party!"" 🎉⚽

""Perfect,"" I whispered, stepping back to admire my handiwork.



After three sleepless nights, I'd finally finished the last pearl on my wedding dress. Every stitch, every bead—placed by my own hands. The ivory silk cascaded to the floor in gentle waves, catching the morning light streaming through my studio windows.



Six years with Alistair had led to this moment. Six years of loving him, supporting him through his illness, donating my rare blood type that matched his perfectly. Six years of building a life together.



The wedding was only three days away.



My phone buzzed on the workbench. Alistair's face lit up my screen, and I smiled, answering with excitement bubbling in my voice.



""Hey! I was just putting the final touches on my dress. You're going to—""



""Hazel, we need to talk."" His voice cut through my happiness like ice water.



My fingers froze on the delicate fabric. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong. I'd never heard that tone from him before—distant, exhausted.



""What is it?"" I asked, my heart suddenly hammering.



He didn't soften the blow. ""The wedding is off.""



The room tilted around me. ""What? Is this some kind of joke?""



""I'm serious, Hazel. I can't marry you.""



My knees weakened, and I collapsed onto my work stool. ""Why? What happened? Did I do something wrong?""



A long pause stretched between us before he spoke again. ""It's Ivy. She's dying.""



Ivy. My stepsister. The thorn in my side since my father married her mother when I was twelve. The girl who had stolen everything from me—my father's attention, my mother's jewelry, my sketches, my friends. Now this?



""What does Ivy have to do with our wedding?"" My voice was barely audible.



""She has terminal cancer. Six months, maybe less."" His voice cracked with emotion I'd rarely heard. ""Her final wish is to marry me.""



The absurdity of his words hit me like a physical blow. ""And you're going to do it? Just like that? Throw away six years of our relationship?""



""Try to understand, Hazel. She's dying. She's your sister—""



""Step-sister,"" I corrected automatically, my mind still reeling.



""She's family,"" he insisted. ""Can't you find it in your heart to pity her? To grant her this one wish before she dies?""



Pity. He wanted me to pity the girl who had tormented me since childhood. The girl who had mocked my dreams of becoming a designer. The girl who now wanted my fiancé.



""You can't be serious,"" I whispered.



""I've already agreed."" His tone hardened. ""Look, I know this is difficult. That's why I'm offering you fifty percent of Everett Enterprises as compensation.""



""Compensation?"" The word felt dirty in my mouth. ""You think you can buy me off?""



""Don't be like that, Hazel. I'm trying to do the right thing here. Why are you being so selfish? It's just a wedding. She's dying.""



Just a wedding. Six years of my life reduced to ""just a wedding."" The room spun around me as I tried to make sense of this nightmare.



""Where are you now?"" I asked, my voice hollow.



""At the hospital. They're preparing a small ceremony for tomorrow.""



""Tomorrow?"" I echoed, my heart shattering. ""That's... that's when we were supposed to have our rehearsal dinner.""



Alistair sighed impatiently. ""This isn't about you right now, Hazel. Can't you think of someone else for once?""



His words slapped me across the face. I, who had given him my blood countless times when his rare condition required transfusions. I, who had held his hand through every treatment, every setback. I, who had built our company alongside him while he recovered.



""By the way,"" he continued, ""I stopped by your studio yesterday when you were out and took your wedding dress. Ivy loved it. She said it was exactly what she would have chosen.""



My breath caught in my throat. ""You... took my dress?""



""She's the same size as you. It fits perfectly."" He sounded distracted. ""Look, I need to go. The doctors are calling me.""



The room blurred through my tears. ""Alistair, please—""



""I'll have my lawyer contact you about the company shares. I really am sorry, Hazel.""



The line went dead.



I stared at the empty mannequin where my dress had stood just yesterday—the dress I'd poured my heart into, every bead and stitch a testament to my love for him. Now it would grace Ivy's body as she took my place beside Alistair.



My phone slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor. Outside, the city continued its morning bustle, oblivious to the fact that my world had just imploded.



Ivy. The scourge of my existence since childhood. I should have known she would find a way to steal this from me too—the one thing I thought was safe from her grasping hands.



How long had this been going on? Had Alistair been visiting her in the hospital while telling me he was working late? Had they laughed together about poor, naive Hazel, slaving away on a wedding dress that would never be hers?



My gaze fell on the small crystal vial on my workbench—Alistair's blood type, rare and precious, that I'd been donating to him since we were teenagers. The same blood that had kept him alive through his illness.



My blood.



My life.



My fiancé.



All stolen in a single phone call.



I closed my eyes, feeling something shift inside me. The pain was still there, white-hot and searing, but alongside it grew something else. Something cold and sharp and unfamiliar.



Three days before my wedding, I stood alone in a studio filled with shattered dreams and a mannequin stripped of its glory. But as the tears dried on my cheeks, I made a silent vow.



This wouldn't be the end of my story. This betrayal would be just the beginning.

...



I sat frozen in my studio, phone still lying where it had fallen from my numb fingers. The empty mannequin mocked me with its nakedness—a perfect metaphor for how stripped bare I felt.



My wedding dress. My fiancé. My future. All stolen in one cruel swoop.



This wasn't the first time my life had crumbled because of the Turner women. Memories flooded back unbidden.



I was eleven when my father first brought Tanya Turner home. My mother was away caring for my sick grandmother, and he wasted no time. I still remember walking into our kitchen to find them entangled against the refrigerator, his hands under her skirt.



""It's our little secret,"" he'd said, his eyes cold with warning.



Six months later, my parents divorced. My mother never recovered from the betrayal. She died of pneumonia two years later, though I knew she'd really died of heartbreak. My grandfather followed shortly after, leaving me alone with the father who'd chosen another woman over his family.



Tanya moved in with her twins—Ivy and Ian—before my mother's funeral flowers had wilted. From day one, she made it clear I was an unwelcome reminder of the woman who came before.



Now, fifteen years later, history was repeating itself. Ivy had learned from her mother well.



""Like mother, like daughter,"" I whispered to the empty room.



I stood up, legs unsteady, and walked to the window. Outside, life continued as if my world hadn't just imploded. Cars honked. People hurried past with coffee cups. The sun shone with offensive brightness.



For six years, I'd loved Alistair. We met in high school, bonded over shared artistic dreams. When he was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder at nineteen, I discovered I was his perfect blood match. How many times had I sat in hospital chairs, needle in my arm, watching my blood flow into collection bags that would later flow into him?



""You saved my life,"" he'd said after the first transfusion. ""I'll never forget this.""



Yet here he was, forgetting everything.



And Ivy—always coveting what was mine. My clothes. My sketches. My friends. Now my fiancé.



I thought of her in my wedding dress—the dress I'd spent months designing, weeks sewing. Every pearl sewn with love. Every stitch a promise. Now she would wear it while marrying the man I loved.



""Cancer,"" I muttered. ""How convenient.""



Tears threatened again, but I pushed them back. Tears wouldn't help me now. They never had.



When my mother died, I'd cried for weeks. Did it bring her back? When my grandfather passed six months later, leaving me truly alone with my toxic new family, did my tears change anything?



No. Tears were useless. Action was all that mattered.



I picked up my phone, scrolled to Alistair's number, and called. He answered on the fourth ring, sounding irritated.



""Hazel, I can't talk right now. I'm with—""



""I want Evening Gala,"" I cut in, my voice steady despite the hurricane raging inside me.



Silence greeted my demand. Evening Gala was our luxury fashion brand—the company we'd built together while he recovered from treatments. My designs. His business acumen. Our shared dream.



""What are you talking about?"" he finally asked.



""You offered fifty percent of Everett Enterprises as compensation,"" I reminded him. ""I don't want it. I want Evening Gala. All of it. Sign over your shares to me.""



He laughed, actually laughed. ""That's ridiculous. Evening Gala is worth millions.""



""And what's a bride worth these days, Alistair?"" I countered coldly. ""You're buying my place at the altar. This is my price.""



""You're being unreasonable,"" he snapped. ""Evening Gala is our flagship brand. It's the crown jewel of Everett Enterprises.""



""Yes, built on my designs. My talent. My reputation."" I kept my voice level. ""It should have been mine from the beginning.""



""We're partners in that company,"" he argued. ""Equal partners.""



""Were partners,"" I corrected. ""Just like we were engaged.""



I heard voices in the background—female voices. Ivy was there, probably wearing my dress, listening to our conversation. The thought stoked my resolve into a bonfire.



""You have two options,"" I continued. ""Sign Evening Gala over to me completely, or I go public with our story. I wonder how your investors would feel knowing you abandoned your fiancée of six years for her dying stepsister? Quite the scandal.""



""You wouldn't dare,"" he hissed.

Scarlett Devereaux was renowned in elite circles as the ultimate seductress, with her perfectly curved red lips and those captivating cat-like eyes that could seduce anyone with just a glance.

While Jackson Blackwell was the epitome of the perfect heir of high society—untouchable, disciplined, and maddeningly self-controlled.

No one would've guessed that these two polar opposites secretly tangled in heated passion in the back of his Maybach at midnight, desperately devoured each other in charity gala bathrooms, or that he'd grip her waist against his vineyard's floor-to-ceiling windows until her legs gave out beneath her.

After yet another night of abandon, the shower's gentle patter filled the bathroom.

Scarlett lounged against the headboard, dialing her father's number:

""I'll marry that dying Miami heir for the fortune, but I have one condition..."" she said coolly.

Her father's voice crackled with barely contained excitement. ""Name it! Whatever you want. If you're willing to marry him, I'll give you anything!""

""Let's discuss it when I get home."" Her voice was soft, but her eyes remained cold and calculating.

Scarlett hung up and was about to dress when she noticed Jackson's laptop sitting nearby.

The Instagram was open, showing a message from someone labeled ""Lily.""

\[Jackson, there's a thunderstorm. I'm so scared...\]

Scarlett's fingers trembled slightly.

Just then, the bathroom door suddenly swung open as Jackson emerged, water droplets trailing down his collarbone. His shirt hung open at the top, two buttons undone, lending his typically austere appearance a hint of sensuality.

""Something came up at the office. I need to go,"" he said, reaching for his jacket, his voice maintaining its usual coolness.

Scarlett curved her lips into a smile. ""Off to the office, or running to your precious soulmate?""

Jackson looked confused. ""What?""

""Nothing,"" she replied, sliding barefoot from the bed, her pale feet sinking into the plush carpet.

His eyes darkened as he caught her chin between his thumb and forefinger, tracing her swollen lips. ""Be good. Don't cause trouble.""

As the door closed behind him, Scarlett's smile vanished instantly.

She called a car and followed him.

Half an hour later, the car stopped outside a hotel. Through the rain-streaked window, Scarlett watched as Lily Bennett, dressed in a flowing white dress, ran out from the hotel entrance.

Jackson strode forward, removing his suit jacket and draping it over her shoulders before sweeping her into his arms.

""It's freezing out here. How could you come outside without a coat, hmm?"" he chided gently.

His movements were so practiced, so natural, as if he'd done this a thousand times before.

Scarlett clutched the door handle until her nails dug painfully into her palm.

As she watched Jackson carefully carrying Lily into the hotel, she suddenly recalled the first time they'd met.

Back then, she'd been fighting bitterly with her father, had actually cracked his skull open during one particularly vicious argument. He'd shipped her off to his best friend's son for ""discipline,"" claiming his rebellious princess needed her sharp edges smoothed out.

When they first met, Jackson was sitting in his penthouse office at Blackwell Industries, his gaze icy cold behind those gold-rimmed glasses.

She was determined not to stay.

So she constantly made trouble.

On her first day, she spilled coffee all over his custom Italian suit worth hundreds of thousands. Yet Jackson merely gave her a passing glance: ""Italian cashmere, air-shipped yesterday. Put it on the Devereaux account.""

On the second day, she deliberately threw important meeting documents into the shredder. Jackson didn't flinch, reciting the entire contents from memory, leaving the executive board stunned into silence.

On the third day, she drugged his coffee and set up cameras, planning to capture embarrassing footage she could use to blackmail him.

Instead, she became his remedy.

When she woke the next morning, her entire body ached. Furious enough to commit murder, Scarlett found herself pinned against the floor-to-ceiling windows for another round.

""Scarlett,"" he whispered against her ear, his voice husky with desire, ""be good.""

Just that simple endearment—""Scarlett""—shattered her defenses.

No one had called her that so tenderly since her mother died.

From that day forward, their relationship transformed entirely.

Every time she acted out, Jackson would simply haul her into his office. Everyone assumed he was scolding her, when in reality he was bending her over his desk until her legs gave out.

Gradually, Scarlett realized she'd become addicted.

Was it his expertise? Or was she just that lonely?

She couldn't tell.

All she knew was that she'd fallen. Hard.

So on his birthday, she spent the entire day decorating his villa—roses, candles, music… She'd even bought an engagement ring.

But Scarlett waited the entire night, watched the candles burn down and the roses wilt, and still he never showed up.

Until three in the morning, when her phone suddenly pinged with a breaking news alert—

\#Billionaire CEO Picks Up Childhood Sweetheart at Airport#

The photo showed Jackson carefully helping a girl in a white dress into his car, looking at her with unbearable tenderness.

The comment section exploded:

""OMG! The CEO and his innocent princess! I'm DYING over here!""

""Holy shit! Isn't that Jackson Blackwell and Lily Bennett from Kingston Prep? They were THE couple back in the day!""

""I went to school with them and can confirm! Mr. Blackwell was ice-cold to everyone except Lily! If she hadn't gotten sick and gone abroad for treatment, they'd be married by now for sure!""

Thud!

The phone slipped from her fingers and clattered to the floor.

Scarlett couldn't believe her eyes.

If Jackson already had someone in his heart, what was she? Just a convenient fuck whenever he wanted?

Trembling, she called Jackson's number, desperate for an explanation, but her calls went straight to voicemail.

After the final failed attempt, Scarlett set down her phone and walked into Jackson's study—a room he'd explicitly forbidden her to enter.

When she pushed the door open, it felt like she'd been struck by lightning.

The room was filled with photos of Lily—graduation photos, vacation snapshots, even candid pictures of Lily sleeping.

The always-composed, always-controlled Jackson Blackwell had done something so... obsessive.

Any need for answers evaporated.

Scarlett started laughing, the sound unnaturally harsh in the empty room.

As she laughed, hot tears spilled down her cheeks, dropping onto the hardwood floor.

Red-eyed, she destroyed the entire villa.

When Jackson returned the next day and saw the devastation, he simply called for cleaning staff.

He didn't even spare her a second glance, as if her behavior was precisely what he expected.

Scarlett watched in silence as the maid swept away the engagement ring box with the rest of the debris.

He had no idea what had been inside.

No idea that she had wanted to spend her life with him.

No idea that when that ring hit the bottom of the trash can, she decided she would never love him again.

""Miss, where would you like to go?"" The driver's voice pulled her back to reality.

""Home,"" Scarlett said, opening her eyes, her voice cold. ""Take me back to the Devereaux estate.""

Upon arriving at the Devereaux mansion, her father immediately rushed to greet her. ""Scarlett, you're really willing to marry into Miami?""

From the staircase, her stepmother watched expectantly.

""Yes,"" Scarlett replied, her eyes turning frosty. ""But I mentioned a condition, didn't I?""

""What is it? Name it!""

""I want to…"" Scarlett enunciated each word clearly, ""sever all ties with you as father and daughter.""

The air suddenly felt thick and unbreathable.

Her father's face contorted with rage. ""Have you lost your mind? Do you even know what you're saying?""

""Perfectly clear,"" Scarlett's voice was ice-cold. ""You cheated while married. To make room for this homewrecker,"" she gestured toward her stepmother, ""you drove my mother to jump to her death. From that day on, I stopped considering you my father.""

She stared at her father's ashen face. ""Now Miami's dying heir is offering five hundred million for a bride to bring him luck, and you've been pressuring me for three months. If I didn't agree, were you planning to drug me and drag me there?""

""If that's how it is, what difference does it make if we're legally related or not?"" She smirked cruelly. ""You can bring your mistress's daughter home and make her the Devereaux princess instead.""

Her father trembled with fury. ""Fine! We'll sever ties! But that Miami heir reportedly won't make it to the end of the month. You MUST marry him before then!""

He laughed coldly. ""As for your stepsister, she just returned from abroad a few days ago and has been staying at a hotel. Since you're so willing to step aside, she'll move in tomorrow!""

Scarlett laughed bitterly, her heart aching. ""Rushing to raise another woman's daughter while rejecting your own. You really are one of a kind.""

She turned to leave, but her stepmother, Victoria, blocked her path with fake concern. ""Scarlett, how can you speak to your father this way?""

Scarlett stopped dead.

She slowly turned, her eyes blazing with years of suppressed hatred. ""What's wrong? Feeling like you can finally act the part of the lady of the house now that I'm leaving? Let me make something crystal clear, Victoria Bennett.""

She advanced step by step. ""Even with my mother dead, nothing changes the fact that you're just a homewrecker that everyone despises! Even if your precious daughter becomes the Devereaux princess, she'll never escape the stain of having a mother who's nothing but a cheap mistress!""

Victoria's face turned deathly pale as she stumbled backward.

Scarlett stormed away, each step feeling like walking on broken glass.

Only when she reached her room and closed the door did she slide to the floor as if all her strength had been drained, burying her face deep in her knees.

The next morning, the sounds of moving and laughter woke her.

""What's going on?"" She flung her door open. ""Can't a person get some fucking sleep around here?""

The housekeeper stammered: ""Miss Devereaux... your stepsister has moved in...""

Before he could finish, a familiar figure appeared at the staircase—

Lily Bennett, wearing a white sundress, stood there looking delicate and vulnerable.

Scarlett's blood instantly turned to ice!

Chapter 2

Scarlett could never have imagined that her stepmother's daughter, who had been ""recovering abroad"" for years, would turn out to be Jackson's precious Lily.

Life had just handed her the cruelest joke imaginable.

A moment later, Lily approached her with a sweet smile. ""Sister, I'm so sorry I disturbed your sleep...""

Before she could finish, Scarlett slammed the door shut with a thunderous bang.

""Scarlett! Where are your manners?!"" Her father roared from outside. ""Clear out your room! If Lily likes it, this will be her bedroom from now on!""

Scarlett laughed bitterly, immediately starting to pack her suitcases.

Outside, she could hear fragments of conversation—

""Uncle Richard, is Scarlett angry?"" Lily's voice was soft as honey.

""Don't worry about her. She's been spoiled rotten since childhood.""

""But...""

""Don't worry, she'll be married off to Miami soon. After that, this house will belong to you and your mother.""

Scarlett's hand paused momentarily before she smirked even more darkly.

She quickly booked an end-of-month flight to Miami and continued packing.

Half an hour later, she wheeled her luggage out of the room.

In the living room, her father, Victoria, and Lily sat on the sofa watching TV, fruit and pastries arranged on the coffee table, looking every bit the picture-perfect family.

Scarlett walked straight toward the door without a glance in their direction.

""Stop right there!"" her father commanded. ""What are you doing now? Don't forget what you promised!""

""Don't worry, I always keep my word,"" Scarlett replied without turning around. ""But for these next two weeks, I'd rather not stay somewhere that makes me sick to my stomach.""

She checked into the Presidential Suite at The Langham, Boston's most expensive hotel and embarked on a shopping spree of epic proportions.

She bought the most exquisite wedding dress, bid millions at auctions for antique jewelry to serve as her dowry.

Even if she was just a ""lucky charm"" bride, she would arrive in Miami like a queen.

Her phone buzzed relentlessly in her bag. Scarlett only checked it after purchasing her final diamond necklace.

Thirty-eight missed calls, all from her father.

She had barely swiped to answer when his furious voice exploded through the speaker: ""Have you lost your fucking mind?! You've blown through thirty million in ONE DAY! Are you trying to bankrupt me?!""

""What's the rush?"" Scarlett laughed coldly. ""Once I'm married, you'll have five hundred million coming your way.""

""But that money hasn't arrived yet! If you keep spending like this, the company will declare bankruptcy tomorrow!""

Scarlett's smile turned vicious.

That was exactly what she wanted.

The five hundred million? She'd already planned to have it transferred directly to her personal account after the wedding.

She wanted to see if Lily and her gold-digging mother would still cling so desperately to a broke old man once the money disappeared.

Did they really think everyone was as foolish as her mother? The woman who had stood by her father while he built his empire from nothing, who worked herself into the hospital with stress, only to be driven to suicide in the end?

Thinking of her mother, Scarlett's heart contracted painfully.

Her phone vibrated again with a text from Jackson: \[What's got you in a mood this time? Why didn't you come to the office today?\]

Scarlett stared at the message for a long time.

For the past year, under the guise of Jackson ""disciplining"" her, she'd reported to his office almost daily.

But now that she was about to marry someone else, what was there left for him to discipline?

When she returned to the hotel carrying over a dozen shopping bags, she found her luggage piled unceremoniously in the lobby.

""What the hell is going on?"" she demanded coldly.

The receptionist looked uncomfortable. ""Miss Devereaux, your card... was declined. According to hotel policy...""

Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from her father: \[If you want to sever ties, stop using my money. I've frozen all your accounts.\]

Scarlett stared at the screen for a long time, until her eyes burned.

Finally, she replied with just two words: \[Fine then.\]

Scarlett then dragged her suitcase down the street.

Her flight wasn't until the end of the month, and now she had nowhere to go. Where would she sleep? What would she eat? How would she survive?

Her suitcase was full of wedding dresses and dowry items she couldn't sell. As for borrowing money...

She'd rather sleep on the street than beg from those vultures in her social circle who were waiting to see her fall.

She had just settled on a park bench when a drunk man staggered over.

""Hey beautiful, all alone?"" he slurred.

""Get lost!"" she snapped.

""Don't be like that, sweetie. Keep me company for a while...""

The moment his greasy hand touched her shoulder, Scarlett raised her hand to slap him.

""ARGH!""

Jackson had appeared out of nowhere, viciously twisting the man's wrist.

Before Scarlett could react, she found herself and her luggage bundled into his car.

""Let me go!"" she protested.

Jackson gripped her flailing wrist. ""What drama are you causing now?""

His voice deepened. ""Homeless, and you still wouldn't come to me?""

Chapter 3

Those words made Scarlett's nose sting with unexpected emotion.

In the past, whenever she'd fight with her father and run away, Jackson would drive around the entire Boston looking for her, then carry her back home on his back.

""What drama are you causing now?"" He would always ask in that same tone.

She would cling to his back, breathing in the crisp scent of cedar that always surrounded him, naively believing that perhaps he cared for her, even a little.

But now she realized no one was more manipulative than him!

He clearly didn't have feelings for her, yet he slept with her anyway.

Then he'd return to his study to moon over Lily's photographs.

She couldn't understand why she wasn't enough compared to Lily.

In terms of family background, beauty, figure—how was she inferior?

Why, of all people, did he have to fall for Lily? Specifically Lily?

""Let GO!"" Scarlett's eyes welled up as she bit Jackson's hand hard.

He frowned slightly but said nothing, simply starting the car.

Jackson drove back to his estate, carrying her luggage inside without hesitation.

""Same as before,"" he said, unbuttoning his cuffs, his tone leaving no room for argument. ""Stay until you're ready to go home.""

Scarlett stood in the entryway, her fingernails digging into her palms. ""I'll only stay for two weeks. After that, I'm leaving this place forever. I'll pay you rent, and I won't bother you anymore.""

""Won't bother me anymore?"" Jackson slowly raised his eyes to look at her, his gaze unfathomable behind those gold-rimmed glasses. ""Are you sure you can manage that?""

Those words cut into her heart like a knife. Scarlett's chest constricted painfully.

So he had known all along.

He'd seen how she'd transformed from initial hostility to complete devotion.

She was hopelessly in love with him.

But what about him? He kept his heart fixated on Lily while coldly watching Scarlett fall deeper and deeper?

""Lily..."" Scarlett suddenly spoke up, ""is my stepmother's daughter. Did you know that?""

Jackson paused in the middle of removing his tie. ""I found out today.""

After a moment of silence, Scarlett couldn't help asking: ""What exactly is your relationship with her?""

""We were at school together,"" Jackson poured himself a glass of water and took a deliberate sip. ""Same university. We worked on the student council together. She saved me during a car accident once, then her health deteriorated and she's been recovering abroad ever since.""

With that, he looked directly at Scarlett, his eyes containing a warning. ""I know you have issues with your stepmother, but this has nothing to do with Lily. Don't target her.""

All the words Scarlett wanted to say became stuck in her throat.

She had planned to ask ""Do you love her?"" but now it seemed laughable.

Seeing how protective he was, what was left to ask?

She turned and retreated to the guest room, slamming the door behind her.

That night, for the first time ever, Jackson didn't come to her.

Scarlett lay in bed, staring at the ceiling blankly.

Of course. His precious Lily was back now. Why would he still bother with her?

The next day, Scarlett deliberately slept until noon, hoping to avoid Jackson.

But when she opened the door, she discovered he was still home.

He sat on the couch, gold-rimmed glasses perched on his straight nose, flipping through a financial magazine.

""Awake?"" he asked without looking up.

""You're not at the office?""

""It's the weekend.""

Scarlett made a noncommittal sound, taking a few pastries from the refrigerator, intending to retreat to her room.

But Jackson suddenly spoke up: ""Change your clothes. We're attending an event together later.""

Scarlett wanted to refuse, but realized she'd rather be out in public than alone with Jackson in the house.

So she changed and went with him.

Only upon arrival did Scarlett discover this was Lily's welcome-home party.

She turned to leave, but Lily enthusiastically caught her arm: ""Sis, I'm so glad you came! Don't fight with Uncle Richard anymore. He was so worried after you left home that he didn't eat for a whole day.""

Scarlett laughed coldly: ""So you know he's just your 'uncle'? Then whether I fight with him or leave home, what business is it of yours? Are you the goddamn neighborhood watch? Mind your own business.""

She yanked her arm away and walked into the private room, catching a glimpse of Lily tearing up and looking pleadingly at Jackson.

Jackson gave Scarlett a dark, warning glance before gently stroking Lily's hair and saying something that made her smile through her tears.

My mum runs a chip shop and she's been struggling on getting good reviews on Google. I was thinking of a software solution to this problem (webdev by trade). I remembered something that I saw at some of the big fast food chains here (KFC, McDonald's) which is that they offer you incentives for leaving them reviews: free chips or a coffee or a small milkshake, something like this that I assume is high-margin for them and easy to offer as a free incentive.

I was thinking of building a product for something like this but tailored more towards smaller businesses--I assume a feature like this comes with any big POS system, but people who run chip shops or kebab stands or anything of this smaller sort don't really want to pay for a full-fledged POS, but something like this they might be interested in if it was priced reasonably.

My initial idea is that we have a flow where the customer scans a QR code after their meal, leave a quick review, if it's positive then they get prompted to copy it and leave it on Google, and regardless of the rating they get a coupon code that they can use on their next visit for something like 10% off, or a free side, or a coffee. Something to catch them while they're still happy with their order and give them a reason to come back.

Do you think customers would actually bother scanning a QR code to leave a review, even with an incentive? And would something like this be worth paying for as a monthly service if it actually worked?

I'm trying to figure out if this is solving a real problem or if I'm just overthinking something that isn't really an issue or already has an existing solution.

Any thoughts? Cheers

“Perfect,” I whispered, stepping back to admire my handiwork.



After three sleepless nights, I’d finally finished the last pearl on my wedding dress. Every stitch, every bead—placed by my own hands. The ivory silk cascaded to the floor in gentle waves, catching the morning light streaming through my studio windows.



Six years with Alistair had led to this moment. Six years of loving him, supporting him through his illness, donating my rare blood type that matched his perfectly. Six years of building a life together.



The wedding was only three days away.



My phone buzzed on the workbench. Alistair’s face lit up my screen, and I smiled, answering with excitement bubbling in my voice.



“Hey! I was just putting the final touches on my dress. You’re going to—”



“Hazel, we need to talk.” His voice cut through my happiness like ice water.



My fingers froze on the delicate fabric. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong. I’d never heard that tone from him before—distant, exhausted.



“What is it?” I asked, my heart suddenly hammering.



He didn’t soften the blow. “The wedding is off.”



The room tilted around me. “What? Is this some kind of joke?”



“I’m serious, Hazel. I can’t marry you.”



My knees weakened, and I collapsed onto my work stool. “Why? What happened? Did I do something wrong?”



A long pause stretched between us before he spoke again. “It’s Ivy. She’s dying.”



Ivy. My stepsister. The thorn in my side since my father married her mother when I was twelve. The girl who had stolen everything from me—my father’s attention, my mother’s jewelry, my sketches, my friends. Now this?



“What does Ivy have to do with our wedding?” My voice was barely audible.



“She has terminal cancer. Six months, maybe less.” His voice cracked with emotion I’d rarely heard. “Her final wish is to marry me.”



The absurdity of his words hit me like a physical blow. “And you’re going to do it? Just like that? Throw away six years of our relationship?”



“Try to understand, Hazel. She’s dying. She’s your sister—”



“Step-sister,” I corrected automatically, my mind still reeling.



“She’s family,” he insisted. “Can’t you find it in your heart to pity her? To grant her this one wish before she dies?”



Pity. He wanted me to pity the girl who had tormented me since childhood. The girl who had mocked my dreams of becoming a designer. The girl who now wanted my fiancé.



“You can’t be serious,” I whispered.



“I’ve already agreed.” His tone hardened. “Look, I know this is difficult. That’s why I’m offering you fifty percent of Everett Enterprises as compensation.”



“Compensation?” The word felt dirty in my mouth. “You think you can buy me off?”



“Don’t be like that, Hazel. I’m trying to do the right thing here. Why are you being so selfish? It’s just a wedding. She’s dying.”



Just a wedding. Six years of my life reduced to “just a wedding.” The room spun around me as I tried to make sense of this nightmare.



“Where are you now?” I asked, my voice hollow.



“At the hospital. They’re preparing a small ceremony for tomorrow.”



“Tomorrow?” I echoed, my heart shattering. “That’s… that’s when we were supposed to have our rehearsal dinner.”



Alistair sighed impatiently. “This isn’t about you right now, Hazel. Can’t you think of someone else for once?”



His words slapped me across the face. I, who had given him my blood countless times when his rare condition required transfusions. I, who had held his hand through every treatment, every setback. I, who had built our company alongside him while he recovered.



“By the way,” he continued, “I stopped by your studio yesterday when you were out and took your wedding dress. Ivy loved it. She said it was exactly what she would have chosen.”



My breath caught in my throat. “You… took my dress?”



“She’s the same size as you. It fits perfectly.” He sounded distracted. “Look, I need to go. The doctors are calling me.”



The room blurred through my tears. “Alistair, please—”



“I’ll have my lawyer contact you about the company shares. I really am sorry, Hazel.”



The line went dead.



I stared at the empty mannequin where my dress had stood just yesterday—the dress I’d poured my heart into, every bead and stitch a testament to my love for him. Now it would grace Ivy’s body as she took my place beside Alistair.



My phone slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor. Outside, the city continued its morning bustle, oblivious to the fact that my world had just imploded.



Ivy. The scourge of my existence since childhood. I should have known she would find a way to steal this from me too—the one thing I thought was safe from her grasping hands.



How long had this been going on? Had Alistair been visiting her in the hospital while telling me he was working late? Had they laughed together about poor, naive Hazel, slaving away on a wedding dress that would never be hers?



My gaze fell on the small crystal vial on my workbench—Alistair’s blood type, rare and precious, that I’d been donating to him since we were teenagers. The same blood that had kept him alive through his illness.



My blood.



My life.



My fiancé.



All stolen in a single phone call.



I closed my eyes, feeling something shift inside me. The pain was still there, white-hot and searing, but alongside it grew something else. Something cold and sharp and unfamiliar.



Three days before my wedding, I stood alone in a studio filled with shattered dreams and a mannequin stripped of its glory. But as the tears dried on my cheeks, I made a silent vow.



This wouldn’t be the end of my story. This betrayal would be just the beginning.

# Chapter 2: The Price of a Bride



I sat frozen in my studio, phone still lying where it had fallen from my numb fingers. The empty mannequin mocked me with its nakedness—a perfect metaphor for how stripped bare I felt.



My wedding dress. My fiancé. My future. All stolen in one cruel swoop.



This wasn’t the first time my life had crumbled because of the Turner women. Memories flooded back unbidden.



I was eleven when my father first brought Tanya Turner home. My mother was away caring for my sick grandmother, and he wasted no time. I still remember walking into our kitchen to find them entangled against the refrigerator, his hands under her skirt.



“It’s our little secret,” he’d said, his eyes cold with warning.



Six months later, my parents divorced. My mother never recovered from the betrayal. She died of pneumonia two years later, though I knew she’d really died of heartbreak. My grandfather followed shortly after, leaving me alone with the father who’d chosen another woman over his family.



Tanya moved in with her twins—Ivy and Ian—before my mother’s funeral flowers had wilted. From day one, she made it clear I was an unwelcome reminder of the woman who came before.



Now, fifteen years later, history was repeating itself. Ivy had learned from her mother well.



“Like mother, like daughter,” I whispered to the empty room.



I stood up, legs unsteady, and walked to the window. Outside, life continued as if my world hadn’t just imploded. Cars honked. People hurried past with coffee cups. The sun shone with offensive brightness.



For six years, I’d loved Alistair. We met in high school, bonded over shared artistic dreams. When he was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder at nineteen, I discovered I was his perfect blood match. How many times had I sat in hospital chairs, needle in my arm, watching my blood flow into collection bags that would later flow into him?



“You saved my life,” he’d said after the first transfusion. “I’ll never forget this.”



Yet here he was, forgetting everything.



And Ivy—always coveting what was mine. My clothes. My sketches. My friends. Now my fiancé.



I thought of her in my wedding dress—the dress I’d spent months designing, weeks sewing. Every pearl sewn with love. Every stitch a promise. Now she would wear it while marrying the man I loved.



“Cancer,” I muttered. “How convenient.”



Tears threatened again, but I pushed them back. Tears wouldn’t help me now. They never had.



When my mother died, I’d cried for weeks. Did it bring her back? When my grandfather passed six months later, leaving me truly alone with my toxic new family, did my tears change anything?



No. Tears were useless. Action was all that mattered.



I picked up my phone, scrolled to Alistair’s number, and called. He answered on the fourth ring, sounding irritated.



“Hazel, I can’t talk right now. I’m with—”



“I want Evening Gala,” I cut in, my voice steady despite the hurricane raging inside me.



Silence greeted my demand. Evening Gala was our luxury fashion brand—the company we’d built together while he recovered from treatments. My designs. His business acumen. Our shared dream.



“What are you talking about?” he finally asked.



“You offered fifty percent of Everett Enterprises as compensation,” I reminded him. “I don’t want it. I want Evening Gala. All of it. Sign over your shares to me.”



He laughed, actually laughed. “That’s ridiculous. Evening Gala is worth millions.”



“And what’s a bride worth these days, Alistair?” I countered coldly. “You’re buying my place at the altar. This is my price.”



“You’re being unreasonable,” he snapped. “Evening Gala is our flagship brand. It’s the crown jewel of Everett Enterprises.”



“Yes, built on my designs. My talent. My reputation.” I kept my voice level. “It should have been mine from the beginning.”



“We’re partners in that company,” he argued. “Equal partners.”



“Were partners,” I corrected. “Just like we were engaged.”



I heard voices in the background—female voices. Ivy was there, probably wearing my dress, listening to our conversation. The thought stoked my resolve into a bonfire.



“You have two options,” I continued. “Sign Evening Gala over to me completely, or I go public with our story. I wonder how your investors would feel knowing you abandoned your fiancée of six years for her dying stepsister? Quite the scandal.”



“You wouldn’t dare,” he hissed.



“Wouldn’t I? Test me, Alistair. See what happens when you strip someone of everything they care about.”



More silence. Then muffled voices—he was covering the phone, discussing with someone. Probably Ivy, whispering poison in his ear.



“You have twenty-four hours,” I continued. “Deliver the signed papers to my lawyer tomorrow morning, or I start making calls to every fashion magazine and business journal that might be interested in this charming story.”



“This isn’t you, Hazel,” he said, his voice softening, trying a new tactic. “You’ve always been so kind, so understanding. What happened to the woman I fell in love with?”



The question struck deep, but I refused to flinch.



“She died when you stole her wedding dress for another woman.”



He sighed heavily. “Fine. I’ll have the papers drawn up. But this ends all obligations between us. No more claims. No contact. Nothing.”



“Agreed,” I said without hesitation.



“Hazel…” His voice dropped lower. “I truly am sorry.”



“No, you’re not,” I replied calmly. “But you will be.”



I hung up before he could respond. My heart hammered in my chest, adrenaline surging through my body. Did I just do that? Did I really just demand an entire company as compensation?



My phone buzzed with a text. Vera, my best friend since college.



“Just heard the news. That backstabbing SOB. Coming over with ice cream and vodka. Don’t do anything insane until I get there.”



Too late, I thought, almost laughing through my pain.



I looked at the empty mannequin again. Then at my sketch table, covered with designs for next season’s collection. My collection. My company now.



Alistair thought he could discard me with a cash settlement. He thought I’d cry and beg and eventually accept whatever crumbs he offered.



He’d forgotten one crucial thing—I’d survived before. I’d rebuilt myself from ashes once when my mother died and my family crumbled. I could do it again.



Next time he saw me, I wouldn’t be the heartbroken ex-fiancée.



I would be the queen who took his crown.

1lmkwfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1lmkwfr/should_i_ask_out_somebody_i_met_at_a_networking/,Should I ask out somebody I met at a networking event?,"I (24M) live in a small town in the US and attend a lot of networking events, as I run a small business.

These events are usually attended by older people, and although I have made friends and genuine connections from these events, I still use them primarily for professional purposes.

I recently met a girl around my age at an event, and have also connected with her on LinkedIn. I wouldn’t usually ask somebody out from an event like this, especially since I imagine it’s difficult enough for women to network without worrying about men hitting on them.

I really think we hit it off though, in a way that I don’t usually feel even when I meet other attractive women my age at events, and I got the impression that the feeling was mutual.

It really isn’t that often I crush on somebody, usually when I date there is an initial attraction that grows into something more rather than an intense crush.

I’m likely to see her again at an event she said that she was attending in a few weeks, but I was considering sending her a message on LinkedIn, to see how she responds.

If she responded well I was going to ask her out for a coffee, and I’m generally pretty confident so don’t usually have an issue with that. My main problem is that asking somebody out like that is pretty common in networking, and doesn’t imply a date in the same way that it would in another context.

I don’t want to come on too heavy or put her in an awkward spot, but I also don’t want to give the impression that this is purely a networking thing for me.

Should I wait and hope she’s at that future event and see how things go, or maybe get a coffee and go in without expectations? This way, I can better see how we get on in person, start building that relationship, and if it goes somewhere romantic, great, but if it stays professional, that’s great too.",1,1751111241.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

For some reason this birthday has really hit me hard. Realizing that like all of us, I was once a twink, twunk and now daddy. Realizing the visible signs of aging are present but feeling good because I’m still at the gym 5 days a week. All of these thoughts about where I’ve been, where I’m at, and where I’m going flood my head often. Thoughts like where tf did 25 years ago, how is it possible they went so fast!? I’ve had a great run so far and hope it continues but am having a hard time accepting aging. I don’t want to relive anything, I love the wisdom, experience and security that come with being 49. But I’m in shock that it’s real. 

I’m partnered with my guy for 10 years this month. 
Love him madly but I’m lonely as he owns a couple businesses and is married to his work. Lonely as my friends are all busy and won’t/can’t commit to a quick meal, coffee chat or activity. I do not begrudge them at all, life is busy, I get it. 

I’m masculine and recently ramped up my gym efforts out of a need to get this angst out. I ve been feeling this need to lift, move or do heavy things. A need to chop wood, shift from maintaining to heavy lifting at the gym, do more cutting/bulking phases. Above all this, I feel a need to find my tribe. I’ve not been successful in finding platonic gay friends. My closest male friends are straight and have accepted me since the teen years. Truly great guys. But they’ve faded out due to their busy lives. My female friends are awesome, loyal and sooo genuine. But I need male friends, gay or straight, platonic, that I can vibe with. Lift or move heavy things with, hunt and gather with, talk about life with. And I have no idea where to find new male friends. I need a tribe.

My mum runs a chip shop and she's been struggling on getting good reviews on Google. I was thinking of a software solution to this problem (webdev by trade). I remembered something that I saw at some of the big fast food chains here (KFC, McDonald's) which is that they offer you incentives for leaving them reviews: free chips or a coffee or a small milkshake, something like this that I assume is high-margin for them and easy to offer as a free incentive.

I was thinking of building a product for something like this but tailored more towards smaller businesses--I assume a feature like this comes with any big POS system, but people who run chip shops or kebab stands or anything of this smaller sort don't really want to pay for a full-fledged POS, but something like this they might be interested in if it was priced reasonably.

My initial idea is that we have a flow where the customer scans a QR code after their meal, leave a quick review, if it's positive then they get prompted to copy it and leave it on Google, and regardless of the rating they get a coupon code that they can use on their next visit for something like 10% off, or a free side, or a coffee. Something to catch them while they're still happy with their order and give them a reason to come back.

Do you think customers would actually bother scanning a QR code to leave a review, even with an incentive? And would something like this be worth paying for as a monthly service if it actually worked?

I'm trying to figure out if this is solving a real problem or if I'm just overthinking something that isn't really an issue or already has an existing solution.

1lmkvf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1lmkvf7/need_to_groan_about_a_pr_i_went_to_yesterday/,Need to groan about a PR I went to yesterday. Please share your ridiculous PR stories in the comments.,"To be clear, I typically enjoy PR's. I'm the guy on scene or out in public who apparently has the ""come talk to me"" face. I also have 2 kids (3 and 6), so it's easy for me to connect with and speak with all ages in age-appropriate language. Generally, I like engaging people in my community, but these PR's are starting to make me feel like a used puppet or prop for some organizer to boast about how awesome they are.

For context: Career department serving 60-80k citizens across 5 stations. Running 3500 calls per year. Most of those calls come from two stations. One of which is my station. So we have plenty on our plate between company inspections, training, call volume, maintenance, etc. 

Yesterday, we got notified that we will be conducting a PR, hosted at a bank, by the bank, for local non-profits. Demographic estimates state there will be people of all ages, and they expect several hundred attendees. Great! The description claims it'll be a good opportunity for US to connect with our community and tell them all about how special and important we are. This was a red flag to me because we do a ton of community outreach already in many successful ways. So it kind of rubbed me wrong. But whatever.

  
We're scheduled for 2 hours in the hottest part of the day. Highs were 100 with high humidity after recent rains. No cloud cover in sight. We arrive, and I'm immediately not impressed, but still generally positive. It's an open parking lot of the bank with one single 6x6 tent, but it's the guy from the radio station with his equipment. We're on the side of the building that's getting completely nuked by sunlight. Not an inch of shade anywhere. We meet with the bank's branch manager who's pretty upbeat about how amazing this all is and tells us we will be stationed outside with the radioman but we are welcome to come in for water and to cool off as needed. Cool. There is nothing outside... except us and the radio host. 

There were no signs, no flags, no tents, no marketing anywhere. Just concrete and a clapped out Honda. Inside were 4 tables for the non-profits, but even they were lackluster. There was a box of cookies and some water. We stood outside for about 30 minutes and not a single person showed up, so we went in and stood around. After about an hour, 2 kids magically come in the door, excited to see the fire truck. Finally! Now I had no problem showing the fire truck to these kids, but they were the kids of an employee at the bank. So it felt orchestrated. As soon as I start showing these kids the truck, the branch manager is over there snapping photos like we were some kind of rare exotic animals, I'm assuming for his socials so he can show his boss how ""well"" everything went. The kids finish, and we don't see another soul for another hour until we leave. 

They expected hundreds. We saw 2. And they were employees' kids. What excellent community engagement they provided for us! Thank you!

  
So, I left there, feeling totally used, photographed for some guy to misrepresent his success for his own gain at our sweaty expense. Hot, and while attempting to stay hydrated, I generally didn't feel prepared to fight any fire or conduct an extrication if a call came in after baking for most of the two hours.

Am I justified to feel like that was the biggest waste of our time and resources? I've been on for a little over a decade now and things like this are starting to happen more frequently. I'd rather run a 2a.m. battery replacement for a smoke detector that's been beeping for 3 weeks. 

  
I just don't know what I'm doing in this career some days. Maybe I'm just getting older, more jaded, and grumpy. Hope not, but yesterday just seemed extra stupid. I'll feel better after I get my coffee in this morning. If you made it this far. Thank you. Please share a story of your own if you have one.

  
TLDR: PR organizer got us to agree to showing up after submitting application stating hundreds of attendees and we saw a total of 2 that were kids of employees at the bank. The proceeded to snap dozens of photos while those kids explored our truck in an attempt to showcase how successful his event was. Had us stationed in the heat with no sunshade during the hottest part of the day. These failed PR events are occurring more frequently and I'm starting to feel like a prop for these organizations.",2,1751111145.0,Firefighting,4,0.67,False

""Perfect,"" I whispered, stepping back to admire my handiwork. 

After three sleepless nights, I'd finally finished the last pearl on my wedding dress. Every stitch, every bead—placed by my own hands. The ivory silk cascaded to the floor in gentle waves, catching the morning light streaming through my studio windows. 

Six years with Alistair had led to this moment. Six years of loving him, supporting him through his illness, donating my rare blood type that matched his perfectly. Six years of building a life together. 

The wedding was only three days away. 

My phone buzzed on the workbench. Alistair's face lit up my screen, and I smiled, answering with excitement bubbling in my voice. 

""Hey! I was just putting the final touches on my dress. You're going to—"" 

""Hazel, we need to talk."" His voice cut through my happiness like ice water. 

My fingers froze on the delicate fabric. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong. I'd never heard that tone from him before—distant, exhausted. 

""What is it?"" I asked, my heart suddenly hammering. 

He didn't soften the blow. ""The wedding is off."" 

The room tilted around me. ""What? Is this some kind of joke?"" 

""I'm serious, Hazel. I can't marry you."" 

My knees weakened, and I collapsed onto my work stool. ""Why? What happened? Did I do something wrong?"" 

A long pause stretched between us before he spoke again. ""It's Ivy. She's dying."" 

Ivy. My stepsister. The thorn in my side since my father married her mother when I was twelve. The girl who had stolen everything from me—my father's attention, my mother's jewelry, my sketches, my friends. Now this? 

""What does Ivy have to do with our wedding?"" My voice was barely audible. 

""She has terminal cancer. Six months, maybe less."" His voice cracked with emotion I'd rarely heard. ""Her final wish is to marry me."" 

The absurdity of his words hit me like a physical blow. ""And you're going to do it? Just like that? Throw away six years of our relationship?"" 

""Try to understand, Hazel. She's dying. She's your sister—"" 

""Step-sister,"" I corrected automatically, my mind still reeling. 

""She's family,"" he insisted. ""Can't you find it in your heart to pity her? To grant her this one wish before she dies?"" 

Pity. He wanted me to pity the girl who had tormented me since childhood. The girl who had mocked my dreams of becoming a designer. The girl who now wanted my fiancé. 

""You can't be serious,"" I whispered. 

""I've already agreed."" His tone hardened. ""Look, I know this is difficult. That's why I'm offering you fifty percent of Everett Enterprises as compensation."" 

""Compensation?"" The word felt dirty in my mouth. ""You think you can buy me off?"" 

""Don't be like that, Hazel. I'm trying to do the right thing here. Why are you being so selfish? It's just a wedding. She's dying."" 

Just a wedding. Six years of my life reduced to ""just a wedding."" The room spun around me as I tried to make sense of this nightmare. 

""Where are you now?"" I asked, my voice hollow. 

""At the hospital. They're preparing a small ceremony for tomorrow."" 

""Tomorrow?"" I echoed, my heart shattering. ""That's... that's when we were supposed to have our rehearsal dinner."" 

Alistair sighed impatiently. ""This isn't about you right now, Hazel. Can't you think of someone else for once?"" 

His words slapped me across the face. I, who had given him my blood countless times when his rare condition required transfusions. I, who had held his hand through every treatment, every setback. I, who had built our company alongside him while he recovered. 

""By the way,"" he continued, ""I stopped by your studio yesterday when you were out and took your wedding dress. Ivy loved it. She said it was exactly what she would have chosen."" 

My breath caught in my throat. ""You... took my dress?"" 

""She's the same size as you. It fits perfectly."" He sounded distracted. ""Look, I need to go. The doctors are calling me."" 

The room blurred through my tears. ""Alistair, please—"" 

""I'll have my lawyer contact you about the company shares. I really am sorry, Hazel."" 

The line went dead. 

I stared at the empty mannequin where my dress had stood just yesterday—the dress I'd poured my heart into, every bead and stitch a testament to my love for him. Now it would grace Ivy's body as she took my place beside Alistair. 

My phone slipped from my numb fingers and clattered to the floor. Outside, the city continued its morning bustle, oblivious to the fact that my world had just imploded. 

Ivy. The scourge of my existence since childhood. I should have known she would find a way to steal this from me too—the one thing I thought was safe from her grasping hands. 

How long had this been going on? Had Alistair been visiting her in the hospital while telling me he was working late? Had they laughed together about poor, naive Hazel, slaving away on a wedding dress that would never be hers? 

My gaze fell on the small crystal vial on my workbench—Alistair's blood type, rare and precious, that I'd been donating to him since we were teenagers. The same blood that had kept him alive through his illness. 

My blood. 

My life. 

My fiancé. 

All stolen in a single phone call. 

I closed my eyes, feeling something shift inside me. The pain was still there, white-hot and searing, but alongside it grew something else. Something cold and sharp and unfamiliar. 

Three days before my wedding, I stood alone in a studio filled with shattered dreams and a mannequin stripped of its glory. But as the tears dried on my cheeks, I made a silent vow. 

This wouldn't be the end of my story. This betrayal would be just the beginning.

# Chapter 2: The Price of a Bride

 

I sat frozen in my studio, phone still lying where it had fallen from my numb fingers. The empty mannequin mocked me with its nakedness—a perfect metaphor for how stripped bare I felt. 

My wedding dress. My fiancé. My future. All stolen in one cruel swoop. 

This wasn't the first time my life had crumbled because of the Turner women. Memories flooded back unbidden. 

I was eleven when my father first brought Tanya Turner home. My mother was away caring for my sick grandmother, and he wasted no time. I still remember walking into our kitchen to find them entangled against the refrigerator, his hands under her skirt. 

""It's our little secret,"" he'd said, his eyes cold with warning. 

Six months later, my parents divorced. My mother never recovered from the betrayal. She died of pneumonia two years later, though I knew she'd really died of heartbreak. My grandfather followed shortly after, leaving me alone with the father who'd chosen another woman over his family. 

Tanya moved in with her twins—Ivy and Ian—before my mother's funeral flowers had wilted. From day one, she made it clear I was an unwelcome reminder of the woman who came before. 

Now, fifteen years later, history was repeating itself. Ivy had learned from her mother well. 

""Like mother, like daughter,"" I whispered to the empty room. 

I stood up, legs unsteady, and walked to the window. Outside, life continued as if my world hadn't just imploded. Cars honked. People hurried past with coffee cups. The sun shone with offensive brightness. 

For six years, I'd loved Alistair. We met in high school, bonded over shared artistic dreams. When he was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder at nineteen, I discovered I was his perfect blood match. How many times had I sat in hospital chairs, needle in my arm, watching my blood flow into collection bags that would later flow into him? 

""You saved my life,"" he'd said after the first transfusion. ""I'll never forget this."" 

Yet here he was, forgetting everything. 

And Ivy—always coveting what was mine. My clothes. My sketches. My friends. Now my fiancé. 

I thought of her in my wedding dress—the dress I'd spent months designing, weeks sewing. Every pearl sewn with love. Every stitch a promise. Now she would wear it while marrying the man I loved. 

""Cancer,"" I muttered. ""How convenient."" 

Tears threatened again, but I pushed them back. Tears wouldn't help me now. They never had. 

When my mother died, I'd cried for weeks. Did it bring her back? When my grandfather passed six months later, leaving me truly alone with my toxic new family, did my tears change anything? 

No. Tears were useless. Action was all that mattered. 

I picked up my phone, scrolled to Alistair's number, and called. He answered on the fourth ring, sounding irritated. 

""Hazel, I can't talk right now. I'm with—"" 

""I want Evening Gala,"" I cut in, my voice steady despite the hurricane raging inside me. 

Silence greeted my demand. Evening Gala was our luxury fashion brand—the company we'd built together while he recovered from treatments. My designs. His business acumen. Our shared dream. 

""What are you talking about?"" he finally asked. 

""You offered fifty percent of Everett Enterprises as compensation,"" I reminded him. ""I don't want it. I want Evening Gala. All of it. Sign over your shares to me."" 

He laughed, actually laughed. ""That's ridiculous. Evening Gala is worth millions."" 

""And what's a bride worth these days, Alistair?"" I countered coldly. ""You're buying my place at the altar. This is my price."" 

""You're being unreasonable,"" he snapped. ""Evening Gala is our flagship brand. It's the crown jewel of Everett Enterprises."" 

""Yes, built on my designs. My talent. My reputation."" I kept my voice level. ""It should have been mine from the beginning."" 

""We're partners in that company,"" he argued. ""Equal partners."" 

""Were partners,"" I corrected. ""Just like we were engaged."" 

I heard voices in the background—female voices. Ivy was there, probably wearing my dress, listening to our conversation. The thought stoked my resolve into a bonfire. 

""You have two options,"" I continued. ""Sign Evening Gala over to me completely, or I go public with our story. I wonder how your investors would feel knowing you abandoned your fiancée of six years for her dying stepsister? Quite the scandal."" 

""You wouldn't dare,"" he hissed. 

""Wouldn't I? Test me, Alistair. See what happens when you strip someone of everything they care about."" 

More silence. Then muffled voices—he was covering the phone, discussing with someone. Probably Ivy, whispering poison in his ear. 

""You have twenty-four hours,"" I continued. ""Deliver the signed papers to my lawyer tomorrow morning, or I start making calls to every fashion magazine and business journal that might be interested in this charming story."" 

""This isn't you, Hazel,"" he said, his voice softening, trying a new tactic. ""You've always been so kind, so understanding. What happened to the woman I fell in love with?"" 

The question struck deep, but I refused to flinch. 

""She died when you stole her wedding dress for another woman."" 

He sighed heavily. ""Fine. I'll have the papers drawn up. But this ends all obligations between us. No more claims. No contact. Nothing."" 

""Agreed,"" I said without hesitation. 

""Hazel..."" His voice dropped lower. ""I truly am sorry."" 

""No, you're not,"" I replied calmly. ""But you will be."" 

I hung up before he could respond. My heart hammered in my chest, adrenaline surging through my body. Did I just do that? Did I really just demand an entire company as compensation? 

My phone buzzed with a text. Vera, my best friend since college. 

""Just heard the news. That backstabbing SOB. Coming over with ice cream and vodka. Don't do anything insane until I get there."" 

Too late, I thought, almost laughing through my pain. 

I looked at the empty mannequin again. Then at my sketch table, covered with designs for next season's collection. My collection. My company now. 

Alistair thought he could discard me with a cash settlement. He thought I'd cry and beg and eventually accept whatever crumbs he offered. 

He'd forgotten one crucial thing—I'd survived before. I'd rebuilt myself from ashes once when my mother died and my family crumbled. I could do it again. 

Next time he saw me, I wouldn't be the heartbroken ex-fiancée. 

I would be the queen who took his crown.

# Chapter 3: A Million-Dollar Betrayal

 

Morning light streamed through the windows of my penthouse as I gathered the last of Alistair's possessions. His designer watch. The cashmere sweater I'd bought him last Christmas. Photos I'd once treasured, now nothing but paper with fading smiles. 

I dropped everything into a cardboard box with detached efficiency. No sentiment. No tears. Just the methodical removal of a cancer from my life. 

My phone buzzed. A message from my lawyer confirming Alistair would arrive within the hour to sign the Evening Gala transfer papers. Perfect timing. I'd just finished purging my home of his presence. 

Vera sat at my kitchen counter, nursing a coffee. ""You sure about this? Taking the company instead of the cash?"" 

""Absolutely."" I sealed the box with packing tape. ""Evening Gala is my creation. My blood. My vision. He just provided the money."" 

""And now you're making him pay again."" Vera grinned. ""I've never been prouder."" 

The doorbell rang precisely at ten. My heart didn't even skip a beat—progress. 

""Showtime,"" Vera whispered, squeezing my hand before retreating to the guest room. She wanted to stay close in case things got ugly. 

I smoothed my black Chanel dress, checked my reflection in the hallway mirror, and opened the door. 

Alistair stood there, looking tired and conflicted. But he wasn't alone. Behind him stood Liana Langdon, his aristocratic mother, her lips pressed into a thin line of disapproval. 

Interesting. He'd brought backup. 

""Hazel,"" Alistair nodded stiffly. 

""You're late,"" I responded, stepping aside to let them in. ""And I don't recall inviting your mother."" 

Liana's perfectly sculpted eyebrows rose. ""I've always been involved in Everett family business matters."" 

""This isn't family business,"" I corrected her coolly. ""It's a settlement between your son and the woman he abandoned."" 

Her face tightened, but she said nothing as they followed me into the living room. 

""Let's get this over with,"" Alistair said, pulling documents from his leather portfolio. ""The papers transferring full ownership of Evening Gala to you."" 

I took them, examining each page carefully. Everything seemed in order—the company, the assets, the intellectual property, all transferred to my name. 

""You're making a serious mistake, Alistair,"" Liana suddenly said. ""Evening Gala is worth—"" 

""I know what it's worth, Mother,"" Alistair cut her off. 

I looked up from the papers. ""Is there a problem, Liana? Does it bother you that your son is finally paying for something worthwhile?"" 

""How dare you,"" she hissed. ""After everything our family has done for you—"" 

""You mean after I spent six years giving blood transfusions to keep your son alive?"" I smiled thinly. ""Yes, you've done so much for me."" 

Alistair flinched. ""Hazel, please. Let's just finish this."" 

I sat at my dining table, spreading the papers out. ""There's one more thing."" 

His eyes narrowed. ""What now? We agreed Evening Gala would settle everything."" 

""Not quite everything,"" I said, pulling out another document my lawyer had prepared. ""I want one million dollars for my wedding dress."" 

""What?"" Liana's voice rose an octave. 

""The custom gown your son stole from my studio and gave to my stepsister,"" I clarified. ""One million dollars seems fair."" 

""That's outrageous!"" Liana exclaimed. ""No dress is worth—"" 

""It's not about the dress,"" I interrupted, my voice deadly calm. ""It's about what it represents. Six years of my life. My blood. My devotion. All tossed aside because poor, dying Ivy wanted to play bride with my fiancé."" 

Alistair's face paled. ""How did you know that was her idea?"" 

I laughed, a short, bitter sound. ""Because I know Ivy. She's spent her entire life wanting what's mine. The wedding dress was the final piece of her collection."" 

Silence filled the room. Alistair looked away, confirming my suspicion. 

""One million dollars,"" I repeated. ""For a handcrafted couture gown that took three months to design and two months to create. For the dress I was supposed to wear when I married you."" 

Liana turned to her son, voice sharp with disbelief. ""Alistair, surely you're not considering this ridiculous demand?"" 

But Alistair's eyes never left mine. He saw the cold determination there, the knowledge I possessed about his new fiancée's true nature. He knew I wouldn't back down. 

""I'll transfer the money today,"" he said quietly. 

""Are you crazy?"" Liana gasped. ""Do you have too much money to burn?"" 

I smiled at her outburst. ""Apparently he does, Liana. Or perhaps he's simply paying the fair price for betrayal."" 

Alistair signed the documents with a steady hand, then pushed them toward me. ""There. It's done. Evening Gala is yours."" 

I signed my portions, then passed him the agreement for the dress payment. ""Your final bill."" 

He signed without hesitation, ignoring his mother's furious glare. 

""Is there anything else you want to take from my son?"" Liana asked bitterly. 

I looked at Alistair, the man I once thought I'd spend forever with. Now, I felt nothing but cold detachment. 

""No,"" I said finally. ""There's nothing else of his I want. In fact—"" I walked over to retrieve the box I'd packed earlier. ""—he can take the last of his possessions with him."" 

Alistair accepted the box, his fingers brushing mine momentarily. No spark. No pain. Nothing. 

""I hope you find happiness, Hazel,"" he said softly. 

""I will,"" I assured him. ""Now that I'm free of you and your family."" 

I walked them to the door, eager to have them out of my space. 

As they stepped into the hallway, Alistair paused. ""For what it's worth, I never meant to hurt you."" 

""But you did,"" I replied simply. ""And now you've paid for it. Goodbye, Alistair."" 

I closed the door before he could respond. 

Vera emerged from the guest room, eyes wide. ""Holy shit, you actually did it! One million dollars for a wedding dress?"" 

""Plus a multi-million-dollar company,"" I reminded her, feeling a strange lightness spreading through me. ""Not bad for a day's work."" 

She hugged me tightly. ""I'm so proud of you. But are you okay?"" 

I considered the question honestly. Was I okay? My fiancé had left me for my dying stepsister. My wedding was canceled. My life had been turned upside down. 

And yet... 

""I'm better than okay,"" I realized. ""For the first time in years, I'm completely free."" 

Free of Alistair. Free of obligation. Free of the constant shadow of Ivy's jealousy. 

I walked to the window, looking out at the city spread before me. Somewhere out there, Alistair was probably explaining to Ivy why he'd just paid a million dollars for her stolen wedding dress. The thought made me smile. 

""What's next?"" Vera asked, joining me at the window. 

I thought about Evening Gala—my company now. All mine. The possibilities stretched before me like an open road. 

""Now,"" I said, ""I build my empire."" ",1,1751110482.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False
1lmko5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1lmko5k/the_day_a_cup_of_coffee_took_over_my_life/,The day a cup of coffee took over my life,"I had always heard about the magical powers of coffee—how it was the ultimate elixir for focus and productivity. I watched people proudly flaunt their cups of black coffee, passionately discussing its deep flavor and the rich aroma that supposedly breathes life into the soul. So, I thought to myself, Why not give it a try? Maybe this was the miracle I needed to become a productive human being like them!

For my first attempt, I decided to drink it black—just like the professionals do. I took my first sip… and nearly choked. What is this taste? Was this really the beloved beverage of millions, or had I just consumed printer ink by mistake? I tried to act like I enjoyed it, but my face betrayed me.

I refused to give up. I added sugar, then milk, then even more sugar—until my coffee transformed into a sweet dessert that had absolutely no connection to the original drink. I finally drank it, feeling proud of myself… until the effects kicked in.

Half an hour later, an unfamiliar surge of energy coursed through my veins. My eyes widened as if I had just unlocked the secrets of the universe. I started talking so fast that I sounded like a news anchor rushing to finish the bulletin before time ran out. I tried to focus on studying, but instead, I found myself cleaning my room, reorganizing my desk, and making life plans all the way until 2050.

When nighttime arrived, I was still buzzing with energy. I sat in bed, counting stars, reevaluating all my life choices, and asking myself, Can coffee actually give people superpowers?

**BERLIN/BEIJING (Reuters) -The threat of mass shutdowns across the automotive supply chain is fading as Chinese rare earth magnets begin to flow, though automakers and suppliers say production plans still face uncertainties and a continued risk of shortages.**

European suppliers have received enough licenses to avoid the widespread disruptions predicted earlier this month but hundreds of permits remain pending, said Nils Poel, head of market affairs at supplier association CLEPA.

The rate of issuance is ""accelerating"" and has risen to 60% from 25%, he said, but cases where the end users are based in the United States, or where products move through third countries like India, are taking longer or not being prioritized.

""Overall the feeling is that we probably will still have production in July and that the impact will be manageable,"" he said.

""Maybe here and there a production line will be affected, but we have avoided that for the moment.""

Volkswagen said in a statement to Reuters its supply of rare earth components was stable while rival Stellantis said it had addressed its immediate production concerns.

China restricted exports of seven rare earths and related magnets in April in retaliation for U.S. tariffs.

Three months later there remains huge uncertainty about how it intends to police its opaque and complex export licensing system.

Since the restrictions were imposed, rare earth magnet exports from China have fallen roughly 75%, forcing some automaker production lines to halt in Asia, Europe and the United States.

FROM 'FULL PANIC' TO 'BARE MINIMUM'

The White House said on Thursday it had signed a deal with China to speed up rare earth approvals without providing details. Beijing said hours later both parties had confirmed details of the deal struck in London earlier this month, which was meant to resolve the rare earth issue, and it would process export licenses in accordance with the law.

Neither party detailed any changes to the existing export licensing system.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview with Fox Business Network on Friday that, under the agreement announced on Thursday, rare earth shipments to the United States from China would be expedited to all companies that have previously received them on a regular basis.

""I am confident now... the magnets will flow,"" Bessent said. ""This is a de-escalation.""

Two weeks ago the car industry was in a ""full panic,"" but license approvals by China have sped up and there is now less threat of a sudden stop, according to an executive at a leading U.S. automotive supplier and a source with knowledge of the supply chain at a major European carmaker. Both asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

China is approving the ""bare minimum"" of critical licenses for European firms to avoid production stoppages, a European official told Reuters, also speaking on condition of anonymity.

U.S. magnet maker Dexter Magnetic Technologies, which has defence clients, among others, has received just five of 180 licences since April, CEO Kash Mishra told Reuters, adding those were intended for non-defence sectors.

""It's an extended delay,"" he said. ""It's 45 days trying to get the paperwork right for the supplier, and then it's 45 more days or so before any licenses are granted.""

# JUNE 27th, 2025~ Time To Reinvent U.S. Critical Minerals Strategy

[Time To Reinvent U.S. Critical Minerals Strategy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2025/06/27/time-to-reinvent-us-critical-minerals-strategy/)

[While the Trump administration has prioritized critical minerals, several obstacles stand in the way of engaging partners to build a supply chain independent from China.AP](https://preview.redd.it/zd1hcmf17n9f1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba9ee208bfd8246278d4f39aea1ec554ea90e0b9)

For the Trump administration, critical minerals are a global policy priority. President Donald J. Trump is trying to get China to relax bans on rare earth minerals desperately needed for American industries, including defense and tech. From Greenland to Ukraine, the U.S. is signaling interest and engagement, be it [intent to acquire](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-options-acquire-greenland-realistic-expert/story?id=120231501) or a [comprehensive energy and minerals agreement](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-know-about-signed-us-ukraine-minerals-deal). In Africa, the U.S. brokered a peace [agreement](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/us-brokers-drc-rwanda-deal-with-high-risk-potential-vast-rewards/ar-AA1H2QP0?ocid=BingNewsSerp) between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, amid conflict over critical minerals on the border of the two countries. This presents opportunities for American investment, driven by a global security strategy by from a president who has notably scaled back from U.S. engagement abroad.

This is because critical minerals are key inputs into advanced technologies, healthcare, defense, energy, and other sectors, and have become a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy (what oil used to be in the 20^(th) century). President Trump has made the development of a critical mineral supply chain to decrease dependence on China for these materials a priority, taking significant steps toward this goal through a March [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/). While mineral agreements have become a key tool of American diplomacy in the modern era, unclear and inconsistently enforced legislation has limited their effectiveness.

# The Inflation Reduction Act’s Limits to Mineral Investment

These self-limiting policies predate the current administration and are a bipartisan policy failure. The [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.csis.org/analysis/onshoring-and-friend-shoring-us-ev-supply-chains-what-are-boundaries), which aimed to build a clean energy supply chain through ‘friendshoring’ associated materials by offering tax credits for clean energy products manufactured with components sourced from countries with a free trade agreement with the U.S. This excludes several key producers of critical minerals, like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Vietnam, and the that do not have FTAs. Although several waivers have been signed to make exceptions to this provision, this is insufficient to create a reliable investment landscape in these countries. Unsurprisingly, investors are hesitant about investing in a place that requires yearly congressional action.

[IRA tax credits prioritize 'friendshoring' components for green technologies, only allowing these credits to be viable if inputs like critical minerals are sourced from countries with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement.The Washington Post via Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/ln7mq3e67n9f1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0fbf7d7a47a66cacc936bb2dd50f87460d17892)

Another aspect of the IRA that limits opportunities for critical mineral investment is its overly broad [definition](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/issue-brief/2025-reconciliation-feoc-provisions-house-ways-and-means-bill/) of “Foreign Entities of Concern”, which includes organizations considered “an entity owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign government” or “an entity that is engaged in conduct detrimental to U.S. national security or foreign policy.” While these definitions may seem reasonable at first glance, they can preclude companies with even a tiny stake of Chinese ownership, or doing business in Russia, from receiving American investment. Considering the history and location of Central Asia, clearly that may affect many U.S. partners there. This prevents companies looking to diversify and receive American investment from doing so, pushing them further into the orbit of competitors. It also enables China to weaponize our own laws against us by strategically investing in locales or companies Beijing has no interest in but wants to keep Western counterparts out.

# Opportunities for Critical Mineral Partnerships

Despite these investment-stifling measures, there are several willing partners prepared to build a lucrative relationship in the minerals sphere. One partner that has displayed significant interest is Kazakhstan, which holds [reserves](https://criticalmaterials.energypolicy.columbia.edu/countries/398/) of several critical minerals and is already pursuing several avenues of cooperation.

In a recent [meeting](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/06/secretary-rubios-meeting-with-kazakhstan-deputy-prime-minister-foreign-minister-nurtleu/) with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Murat Nurtleu emphasized critical minerals as a key avenue of cooperation between the two countries. American educational institutions are also growing their presence in the country, with the Colorado School of the Mines [partnering with a local university](https://timesca.com/colorado-school-of-mines-to-open-first-international-campus-in-kazakhstan/) to train a skilled workforce for Western mining companies.

This demonstrates a new dimension of cooperation with the U.S., fostering relations while producing tangible results and expanding the workforce eligible to work in the specialized mining industry. Such a model can also be applied outside of Kazakhstan, both in Central Asia and beyond.

# The Risks of Opaque Legislation

While these steps are promising, they do not offset the skepticism towards American investment prompted by regulations that exclude too many countries from productive engagement in the mining and refining of the rare earth elements. For example, secondary sanctions against companies or economies dealing with Russia, while not imposed on Kazakh mineral producers, remain a looming threat, having been levied against [other entities](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2785) in Central Asia, a region that was a part of the USSR and now has close ties with its former colonial master.

In addition, Astana has been subject to scrutiny by Washington before, having been [investigated](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IN11145.pdf) under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act regarding the national security implications of its uranium exports to the U.S. The first Trump Administration ruled that no quotas or other trade measures were to be placed on Kazakhstan as a result of the investigation, yet it sent signals to investors that they may incur political risk by investing in Kazakhstan. Now, a global Section 232 investigation is ongoing, despite the dire need for the U.S. to secure sources of uranium imports. Kazakhstan is the number one exporter of uranium in the world.

**The United States has made clear its appetite for partnerships in the critical minerals sector and is keen to compete with China and create a supply chain that Beijing does not control. Washington’s actions stretching back through multiple administrations, however, create a difficult environment for mineral-rich countries that seek investment but are not amongst the partners of the U.S. with a free trade agreement.**

**Even as the country pursues a secure mineral supply chain, establishing trust and clarity with potential partners must be a top priority. The current state of affairs, where the United States keeps a close circle of trade partners, keeps many potential partners out, and issues random exemptions for others, is untenable. The U.S. cannot afford legislative and policy uncertainties, delays, and confusion when America’s national security is on the line.**

[The announcement of a deal between the United States and China on rare earth magnets ](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-rare-earths-are-flowing-again-not-freely-2025-06-27/)for a range of technologies is a welcome reprieve for many technology companies and for the defense sector as well. Yet, this deal remains fragile in the context of capricious tariffs and a dysfunctional dispute resolution system within the World Trade Organization. What is now needed is to capitalize on the deal and use it as a confidence-building measure to establish a longer-term international agreement for managing critical minerals supply. In a recent paper, myself and a coalition of scholars from across a range of mineral producing and consuming countries [have argued for a “minerals trust” for the green transition. ](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv9841)We also prepared an accompanying [policy brief under the auspices of the United Nations University ](https://collections.unu.edu/eserv/UNU:10184/UNU-INWEH_Policy_June-2025-Brief_critical_minerals.pdf)to provide specific policy recommendations ahead of the G7 meeting in Canada earlier this month.

[The G7 issued a communique on critical minerals](https://g7.canada.ca/assets/ea689367/Attachments/NewItems/pdf/g7-summit-statements/minerals-en.pdf) on June 17th which was fairly broad in scope but most noteworthy was the fact that China was not singled out for constraining mineral supply. Furthermore, the communique explicitly mentioned the role of the more multilateral G20 organization in furthering aspirations for investment, particularly through the [G20 Compact for Africa.](https://www.compactwithafrica.org/) China as well as Russia are of course members of the G20 along with other key mineral producers such as Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, Brazil and South Africa. It would be opportune to now move the conversations on minerals diplomacy to the G20 which will incidentally be chaired by the United States of America in 2026.

A key intermediary step will be the planned critical minerals conference this September in Chicago which has been announced already at the G7 meetings. At this conference, there needs to be consensus reached on what are realistic targets for “near-shoring” and diversification based on thigh quality ore bodies and economically feasible technologies. Mineral extraction sites are geologically determined and any policies that set targets for domestic production need to be predicated in geoscience. The challenge at present is that there are more than 400 national policies on critical minerals in various forms worldwide according to the International Energy Agency’s policy tracking tool. Most of these policies are not aligned with geoscience or economics of extraction. Furthermore, they often neglect the prospects for a circular economy as well for minerals.

The rare earths deal between the United States and China should be expanded to have a systems level approach towards building a minerals trust, particularly for those metals needed for the Green Transition. The trust would also provide opportunities to have stockpiles and source metals from recycled sources. [Currently, less than 5% of rare earth magnets are recycled but this may soon change based on recent technologies that have been developed by Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH).](https://www.reuters.com/science/zurich-researchers-pioneer-rare-earth-e-waste-recycling-2025-06-26/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Yet much of the infrastructure from which these magnets would be recycled is also in China. Ultimately, even with diversification efforts, China’s role in sourcing rare earths from both primary and secondary source cannot be discounted and pursuing a cooperative approach is both ecologically and economically prudent.

The benefits of using a high-quality 30-ounce water bottle extend beyond simple hydration. It offers practical advantages that contribute to overall well-being and convenience in various aspects of daily life.

**Improved Hydration:** A 30-ounce water bottle provides a convenient way to track and achieve daily hydration goals. Consistently refilling and consuming the bottle throughout the day helps individuals maintain optimal hydration levels, leading to improved energy levels, cognitive function, and physical performance.

Regular hydration also supports healthy skin, digestion, and overall organ function. By having a readily available source of water,users are more likely to drink enough throughout the day compared to relying on infrequent trips to the water fountain.

**Enhanced Convenience:** Carrying a 30-ounce water bottle eliminates the need to purchase bottled water frequently, saving money and reducing plastic waste. this convenience is particularly valuable for individuals who are constantly on the go, whether commuting to work, traveling, or engaging in outdoor activities.

A dedicated water bottle ensures that a refreshing drink is always within reach, eliminating the dependence on perhaps unhealthy or expensive alternatives.The ease of refilling the bottle at any water source further enhances its convenience and promotes enduring hydration practices.

**Cost Efficiency:** While a high-quality 30-ounce water bottle may represent an initial investment, it proves economical over time by eliminating the need for disposable plastic water bottles. The average person can save hundreds of dollars annually by switching to a reusable water bottle.

This cost savings,combined with the environmental benefits of reducing plastic waste,makes a reusable water bottle a financially and environmentally responsible choice. Furthermore, some workplaces and public spaces offer filtered water refill stations, making it even easier and more cost-effective to stay hydrated.**Environmental Sustainability:** Choosing a reusable 30-ounce water bottle significantly reduces the environmental impact associated with disposable plastic bottles. The production, transportation, and disposal of plastic bottles contribute to pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and landfill accumulation.

By switching to a reusable option, individuals can actively participate in reducing plastic waste and promoting a more sustainable lifestyle. Many water bottle manufacturers are also committed to using recycled materials and eco-friendly production processes, further enhancing the environmental benefits of their products.

**Healthier Lifestyle:** Using a reusable water bottle encourages healthier habits by promoting consistent hydration and reducing the consumption of sugary drinks. having water readily available makes it more likely that individuals will choose water over soda, juice, or other less healthy beverages.

This can lead to a reduction in calorie intake, improved blood sugar control, and better overall health. Furthermore, regular water consumption can help flush out toxins, improve digestion, and support weight management.

**How long will a 30-ounce insulated water bottle keep drinks cold or hot?**
The insulation performance varies depending on the technology used and the ambient temperature. High-quality vacuum-insulated stainless steel bottles can typically keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours. However, factors such as the initial temperature of the beverage, how often the bottle is opened, and the surrounding surroundings can affect these numbers.

I am using the Lavazza Gran Crema beans (I know, I know, fresh roasted are better..) and have pulled a decent double shot of espresso with a grind size of 9. I did lower the brew temp because it was slightly bitter. 

I went to make my husband a cup of coffee this morning and it was WEAK and watery. Classic, 12 oz, grind size of 25 was not it. We tried again with rich, grind size 23, 8 oz and high temp and it was a bit better but still not that rich Nespresso coffee taste we are used to.

I’m going to try a cold brew later but don’t want to keep wasting beans troubleshooting so I’m curious - what are your perfect settings for:

Double shot?
Coffee?
Cold brew?

I recently figured out why I use caffeine.  It's not simply for energy, being able to wake up, I like sugar and caffeine.  I have been using it as an escape.  A mental escape because my whole life I have struggled with anxiety.  I have dissociation from trauma and for some reason for me, feeling calm feels like a threat.  I am hyper vigilant at all times, even when completely alone at night in bed.  It's utterly exhausting but it feels ""normal"" for me.

I realized I am using caffeine as a tool to KEEP me in this hyper aware/alert state because it feels like home.  It was never about the caffeine.  I was only using it to NOT come back into my body.  To sit with the silence of my mind and deal with all my emotions without the constant buzz of adrenaline.  I enjoyed the chaotic noise and I hate this.

Anyways, this morning I knew my decision to not reach for caffeine was like a fork in the road.  It wasn't just ""Oh whatever...I'll try again next week.""  If I didn't do this today, I never will.  I finally see caffeine for what it was.  A tool to help me stay away from myself.  From my mind.  Afraid of actual peace.  I didn't cave today and I feel so good about it.  I literally almost said fuck it and just drank it but I knew that it was more then about coffee or not having coffee.  It wasn't just a substance that I'm trying to stay away from.

Sorry if this sounds super dramatic and it kind of is because of everything I have experienced.  It was never the caffeine.  It was my way of trying not to feel in my body because caffeine is so good at taking me OUT of my body.

Anybody else struggle with something similar?  Consuming caffeine because you ""like"" the background anxiety noise it can bring?  ",2,1751108916.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

On my way back home I finally had to pull over and use the restroom.   Just outside of Rte. 78 and I-20 was a podunk gas station and restroom so I filled up with gas and went in to use the bathroom.   The men’s bathroom was vacant, but the women’s bathroom was available and I was on the verge of pissing myself so I figured I’d say screw it and go real fast.    I bolted in and saw an empty stall so I turned and locked the door to make sure nobody else came in.   

Unfortunately there apparently was a lady in the other stall and while she did make a comment about locking the door or something, my hearing is severely degraded and I couldn’t make sense of what she said.    I also knew if I spoke up it would clearly give me away and I didn’t think she had even seen me since she was in a shut stall.   

Consequently I said nothing and relieved myself until she left the restroom.  When I left she was apparently waiting outside the bathroom to snap a quick photo (for what reason I’ll never know but whatever) and I rushed out back my car embarrassed and ready to get back home.  

If you happen to be that lady, just know that I’m truly sorry from the bottom of my heart and I’ve never EVER used a ladies bathroom in my entire life…. Even when I was potty training my children.

There is a classroom section to give real race craft information. Tutorials, and practice events to hone those racing skills, everything from side by side racing without contact to fuel saving, and using the draft as a weapon not just a speed boost, and basic but advanced techniques like trail braking and suspension tuning. 

An IMSA-inspired calendar mixes in sprint races with endurance. Stand alone endurance races are soon to be added as its own championship. Relaxing, community build events will be appearing in the Coffee Break, a throwback to events held in GT4 but without the cones and pressure.

Are you vigorously counting calories in your meals, skipping meals, and have enrolled yourself for a workout session that makes you more tired than slim? You have found good weight loss food to eat, and even planned a diet to lose belly fat. Still, your efforts are going fruitless? With all these going on. There’s something deeply comforting to know that you don’t need to take all these extreme efforts to see real change. Sometimes, the solution is quite natural. Wondering how to lose belly fat naturally? In this read, you will find the answer to this and learn about an ayurvedic way to lose weight naturally. So, let’s kick off.

# [How to Lose Weight](https://www.myslimtonic.com/blogs/how-to-lose-weight-in-one-month.php) naturally?

Do you know why the ayurvedic way makes sense? Ayurveda understands that weight gain is rarely just about food. There are several other factors, like digestion slowing down, metabolism taking a rest, or your body adding up toxins and stress.

Ayurveda believes that to lose weight, balancing the body and mind is most essential, which means physical and emotional health are equally important. People are more concerned about belly fat, but excess fat in any part of your body is as unhealthy as tummy fat. Ayurvedic Slimtonic is built around this understanding.

# Slim Tonic: Lose Weight Naturally

Slim Tonic is a formula of powerful ayurvedic herbs, carefully selected and combined to gently lead your body toward natural fat loss. And the best part? It does so without draining your energy or making you feel like you're fighting your body.

Slim Tonic doesn’t try to burn fat through artificial means. Instead, it strengthens your whole system, supports better digestion, balances metabolism, and slowly pushes excess fat, water retention, and unhealthy cravings out.

To lose post-pregnancy belly fat, women don’t have to fight with their bodies. Slimtonic helps them work with it. It is not a miracle pill that promises to help you lose weight in one month. Slimtonic is made from herbs you might have heard of, especially if you are aware of ayurvedic or Indian home remedies.

Triphala: This combination of three herbs controls appetite, stimulates metabolism, detoxifies, and helps in digestion and fat reduction.

Harar: Known as a gentle colon cleanser, it keeps your stomach light and removes stored waste.

Bahera: Targets fat, typically around the belly, and also improves your immunity.

Aloe Vera: A natural laxative and metabolism-enhancer that suppresses appetite, aiding weight loss.

Nagarmotha: It aids in regulating stress-related weight gain. It increases calorie expenditure, reduces fat accumulation, and assists in weight loss.

Green Coffee: Green coffee activates fat-burning, stimulates metabolism, and controls hunger.

Green Tea: It prevents the absorption of fat, making weight loss easier.

Amla: Supports your immunity and skin health.

Apamarga: A fat-reducing herb. It works in a gradual, natural way.

Haridra: A natural anti-inflammatory and digestive herb.

These herbs work quietly but powerfully. No crash, no sudden spikes, just gentle, steady weight loss.

# Weight Loss is not just about Reducing Belly Fat.

When the body feels heavy, bloated, and sluggish, Slim Tonic helps clear that out. It reduces cravings, improves metabolism, and gradually, you can see inch loss.

Slim Tonic helps in five simple yet effective ways.

Targets Fat Accumulated Areas: Slim Tonic especially targets the fat areas, like the belly, thighs, arms, and sides, the areas that accumulate too much stubborn fat

Controls Unhealthy Cravings: The herbs in Slim Tonic suppress cravings, the slayer of weight loss goals.

Boosts metabolism: With good metabolism, you burn calories better, even when at rest.

Reduces Bloating: Thanks to herbs like Punarnava, you don’t have to carry watery weight.

Cleanses the Digestive Tract: Keeps your gut clean and active.

And the best part? You don’t feel exhausted or deprived while using it.

# No Guilt, only Realistic Result

You don’t have to burden your body or go hungry. No chasing quick weight loss pills that bring back the lost weight a week later. Go for a sustainable [ayurvedic way to lose weight](https://www.myslimtonic.com/). Ayurvedic remedies for weight loss are natural and make you feel lighter and energetic when your digestion and metabolism improve. You can see visible changes, especially around the waistline, when you add healthy food and lighter exercise to your routine.

# Let’s Conclude

The world makes weight loss feel like a race. But you don’t need to run yourself into the ground to feel better in your body. Ayurvedic ways to lose weight and remedies like Slimtonic give your body the needed support to lose weight slowly but steadily. They don’t punish your body but nourish and you can see the change, not just on the weighing scale but in your mood, energy, and confidence.",1,1751108473.0,u_Slimtonic,1,1.0,False

I‘m curious if i should bring it to the police, or if they‘ll just trash it. Funnily enough, there is a fingerprint from (coffee?, dirt?) on the Envelope. 

Any Help is appreciated, maybe even the correct subreddit for this. 

Thanks for the attention.

Hey fellow parents! I've discovered the holy grail of morning nutrition that *actually* tastes good enough for even my pickiest eater. If you're tired of battles over breakfast or that mid-morning energy crash (yours or theirs!), this might be the game-changer your family needs.

## The Magical Green Concoction

I was skeptical about green smoothies too. My first attempts looked like swamp water and tasted... educational. But this blueberry-apple-spinach-orange blend has become our family's secret weapon for sustained morning energy without the sugar crashes that used to turn my sweet angels into cranky demons by 10am.

What makes this work is the perfect balance of natural sugars, fiber, and nutrients that keep energy levels stable. The blueberries and apple provide quick energy, while the spinach sneaks in those leafy greens without the bitter taste. Best part? My kids can't even taste the spinach!

## Nutritional Benefits (That I Don't Actually Tell My Kids About)

This smoothie delivers some serious nutritional punch in a format kids actually consume:

| Ingredient | Key Benefits |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| Blueberries | Antioxidants, brain health, natural sweetness |
| Apple | Fiber, steady energy release, familiar taste |
| Spinach | Iron, folate, vitamin K (completely disguised!) |
| Orange | Vitamin C, enhances iron absorption, bright flavor |

The vitamin C from oranges actually helps your body absorb the iron from spinach better - it's like these ingredients were made to work together!

## How to Make It (Without Destroying Your Kitchen)

Here's my foolproof method refined through countless early morning zombie-mode attempts:

1. **Add liquid first** - This creates a vortex that pulls everything down
2. **Start blending on low** - Prevents the dreaded chunk-stuck-at-bottom situation
3. **Use frozen blueberries** - Adds thickness without watering it down with ice
4. **Mix spinach with other ingredients** - Helps it blend completely (no green bits for kids to spot!)

Pro parent tip: Having a decent blender makes a HUGE difference. After destroying three cheap blenders, I finally invested in a better one and it's been worth every penny.

## FAQs From My Parent Friends

**""Can I prep this the night before?""**  
Absolutely! I portion ingredients into containers or baggies on Sunday for the whole week. Morning-you will thank evening-you for this preparation.

**""How long does it keep?""**  
It's best fresh, but stays good refrigerated for about 24 hours. I sometimes make extra and send it in an insulated container for my kid's lunch.

**""My kid hates green things. Will they really drink this?""**  
Mine did! The blueberries turn it more purple than green, which helps. Start with less spinach and gradually increase as they get used to it.

**""What if I don't have blueberries?""**  
Strawberries, raspberries, mango, or even banana work great as substitutes. Each creates a slightly different flavor profile, so you can rotate based on what's on sale or in season.

## The Real Parent Review

The true test? My 6-year-old asks for her ""super strength smoothie"" every morning now. My 9-year-old actually gets his own ingredients ready. And me? I'm not reaching for that third cup of coffee anymore.

What started as a desperate attempt to get some nutrition into my kids has become our morning ritual. There's something satisfying about watching those vibrant colors swirl together, knowing we're all starting our day with something that actually supports our bodies instead of working against them.

Very peaceful time indeed. And a great time to meet some new folk.

Other than consuming coffee on A frequent basis, I like to read science fiction, fantasy, and horror. I also enjoy being outdoors, camping, hiking, that kind of thing.

Fellow sleep-deprived parents! After my third coffee before 10 AM still left me dragging, I stumbled upon a game-changer - a cucumber-grapefruit juice blend that's become my secret weapon for parenting energy. Sounds weird, right? That's what I thought too!

## Why This Works Better Than My Coffee Addiction

This unlikely pairing delivers exactly what parents need:

* **Sustained energy** without the inevitable caffeine crash
* **Natural hydration** (unlike dehydrating coffee)
* **Vitamin boost** when you barely have time to eat
* **Mental clarity** without the jitters or afternoon slump
* **Digestive benefits** from the ginger (helpful after surviving on kids' leftovers!)

The cucumber provides a cooling, refreshing base while the grapefruit adds that wake-up zing that gets your brain functioning again. That small piece of ginger? It's the secret ingredient that ties everything together.

## The Super Simple Recipe

**Ingredients:**
* 1 medium cucumber (firm with bright green skin)
* 1 pink grapefruit (choose one heavy for its size)
* Small piece of fresh ginger (about thumb-sized)
* 1 cup filtered water

**Instructions:**
1. Add water to blender first (creates proper liquid base)
2. Add ginger slice, then chopped cucumber
3. Add grapefruit segments last
4. Blend on medium-high for 60 seconds
5. Strain if desired (I rarely bother on hectic mornings)

## Parent Hacks I've Discovered

| Hack | Benefit |
|------|---------|
| Prep ingredients night before | Saves precious morning minutes |
| Make double batch | Second serving for afternoon energy slump |
| Add to ice cube trays | Quick addition to water bottles |
| Let kids help make it | They're more likely to try it themselves |
| Pour into popsicle molds | Healthy treats kids actually enjoy |

## When This Saved My Parenting Day

Last weekend, my 4-year-old had a meltdown over the ""wrong color cup"" while my toddler decided diaper changes were optional. Instead of my usual coffee, I gulped down this juice blend. The difference was remarkable - I felt refreshed rather than wired, and somehow managed to defuse both situations without losing my cool.

My spouse was skeptical until it helped them power through an entire Saturday of soccer games and birthday parties after a night of teething baby duty.

## Storage Tips

The juice keeps for about 48 hours refrigerated, though it's definitely best fresh. I've found adding a splash of sparkling water makes it feel like a special treat when I need that afternoon boost during naptime (which is actually my work-from-home time).

Surprisingly, my kids enjoy a diluted version of this, which feels like a parenting win considering how many vegetables they typically refuse!

Has anyone else found alternatives to coffee that actually work for parenting energy? What's your go-to natural energy booster?

A few years ago, I was working at a popular petrol station, on a popular freeway. Unfortunately, one afternoon I'd had a freak accident reaching for my drink bottle (my core was obviously still developing) and I slipped a disc between L5-S1. Side note-it was beyond anything I'd ever experienced. My mother dressing me as a grown adult, heavily relying on opioids as if I even so much as cough, my legs would crumble. 
Many months of physio etc I was approved to return for minimal hrs. I UNDERSTAND it was a freak accident, and not at one point did I blame it on the company, BUT it happened at work which probably saved me years of spinal surgeries. Carrying on. 

One day back at work during a 4 hr shift, I'd had a sore throat that day. Normally, we are allowed to grab a coffee once a shift- I asked the 2IC (let's call him Clifford) if it was possible to have a cup of slushie instead to sooth my throat. Clifford responded- ""yeah that's cool, just put it in a coffee cup"". Which I did, following his guidance. Side note, I was SOOTHED.

The next morning at approx 7am, I awoke to an official email from this company stating I'm being suspended without pay due to a serious breach of conduct. 
Obviously, I'm baffled and pretty upset. I'm aware that I'm back on reduced hours, being watched, etc etc. I reply and we set up a meeting in person 2 days later. Attending; me, my support person, the 2IC, the store manager, and 2 persons from HR which I'm SURE they had to make a gigantic drive for. We sit down in an adjacent building. Still baffled.

The store manager: ""Hi, so we've called you here today for an offence that we can terminate you immediately"". Tbh at this point I was absolutely SHITTING myself. What have I done? It was like when you go through airport customs and you're wondering if that kilo of cocaine was accidentally left in your carry on. I ask them to elaborate. 

They begin with a VERY patronizing question which was the first red flag. ""Do you understand the definition of stealing?"" 
Me, still baffled: I would like to think so???!!

The store manager begins- (back story to set the scene; he was 5""0, 50 years old, VERY flamboyant) 
Monday, you drank a slushie, out of a coffee cup and that is a breach and considered stealing. 
At this point I was relieved because the 2IC was IN the meeting, and I reacted like ""oh!!! This is all a misunderstanding, I asked Clifford before I touched anything! I thought it was same/same but double checked and got permission :)"".

THIS MF (2IC) looks me directly in my eyeballs, across the table and says ""??? That never happened???"" 

The silence was palpable. My jaw was in my lap. My eyes are darting back and forth, thinking theres NOOOO WAY I'm being set up lmao. 170 scenarios ran through my head. Confusion, shock, anger, THEN......acceptance. My back was fucked, I was trying my best to recover and now being accused of ripping *petrol station* off by 0.03 cents worth of slushie so the managers could get a bonus from getting rid of me. This is my favourite part. Everything melted away. The anger, the unjust, EVERYTHING. 

I let out a big sigh and I started smiling. I looked directly at the store manager, who unfortunately for him underestimated my observation skills. A week prior, mind you there was PLENTY of other offences..I saw him purposely knock a pkt of oreos off the shelf following an ""oops, I guess I'll have to write that off for my morning tea meeting hehehehe"". At the time, I didn't even THINK about it. I don't care. You do you. But now??????

I said alright. But if IM confused, let me clarify something. I stared down the store manager, laid out what had happened, and asked him and HR if THAT would be considered stealing. Without breaking eye contact. I witnessed his soul leave his body. I sensed HR do a slow pause and turn. I quickly moved on, I was taking everyone down.

Next, the 2IC. Who I also had nothing against but here we are. He was freshly married, 2 year old and a baby on the way. He was ALSO fucking another cashier, let's call her Trina, in the bathrooms during work. Again. I minded my own damn business, even though I thought he was a POS. 

I looked at him, then the manager, then HR, and asked if the 2IC was a reliable source of information seeing as he's having sex in the bathroom, cheating on his wife etc etc. another one down. 
By this point HR are needing a defib.
Then I threw in that half the staff are smoking weed on their break (no hate but it was more to throw shade that the manager is useless)

While I was at it, I truly only liked 2 people that worked there, from a very busy 24 hrs store. I went on for the next 30 minutes about every single breach I had seen, in the last week and let them know I could definitely help them out with more information etc.

The meeting was abruptly ended. 


3 days later: I was still OFFENDED, but had gathered myself and I thought ""FK them, I'm young I'll move on"" . HR called me and asked me to come in, and I had absolutely prepared myself to be fired and I was already mentally checked out recognising that there's no way I could go back and play nice with people that threw me under the bus. 

I sit down. HR are GROVELLING. There's probably some sort of court case I could have followed. But again, I was young and ready to burn the bridge. They offered me a 2IC job. 

Oh??? What happened to Clifford? They tell me that he AND Trina have quit because Clifford's wife was trying to pull her through the safety barrier every time she went on shift. Also, they fired 18 people for breaches after going through alot of footage. This included staff eating expired food etc. I asked them to give me some time to think about. 

I walked back over to the main store, there is my manager in tears, packing his stuff up in the office into a cardboard box like some sort of movie scene. 

I couldn't help myself. I had a spring in my step. I asked him why would he be crying? What's wrong??? He told me through tears he's going on leave blah blah blah. 

I quit 3 days later and went to another country on credit card. Best 2 weeks of my life.

1lmjryb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmjryb,It's a start. [OC],"My husband and I have moved to upstate New York and have been in the house for about 4 weeks. I've been pretty good about feeding the crows here every morning and only missed one morning due to being out of town. I made it up them the next day saying out loud, ""Sorry I missed breakfast and dinner yesterday, guys"" as I put their plate on the table. I made it up to them the next morning. LOL

I haven't tried hand feeding anyone yet, we're too busy with the house and move in right now. I'll also walk around the backyard tossing shelled and unshelled peanuts to entice them to come by during the day, which they do. I figured I have time to make friends with the crows when our day to day life is more stable and consistent. My goal right now is to show the crows here that our house is a consistent food source.

A note about a mud pit you'll see. We had to raze an old dilapidated carriage house and the process of removing debris and putting in fill dirt resulted in this b.s. Trust me, I'm furious and right now all we can do is wait until the mud dries.

In the mean time, crows will drink out of the puddles in the excavator tracks and take their unshelled peanuts and milk bone treats to dunk in the puddles. Where the picnic table is I can't see from the kitchen until we move it, but I can see the crows by the water puddles in the excavator tracks.

Photos are in no particular order, crows first then plates. Food has been shelled and unshelled peanuts, milk bones, meal worms, and in the mornings only some  wet dog or cat food (I have a ""dinner"" feeding where it's only ""hard"" food). I used to put trinkets, even made a sign for photos for this sub, but have decided against it for now and am no longer putting the extraneous stuff out for now. I'll restart putting trinkets for them to take when we settle in better in the house.

My goal right now is to get them used to our house as a place to visit in their daily routine.

One last bit of information. They're not flying away from me as fast and are feeling more comfortable. Being in a new house I'm working out a new morning routine and I've noticed that the crows have actually picked up on it. I read about other folks reporting they notice crows outside their windows and I know what they mean now.

It's different. It's not like you're just looking outside your window and you happen to see a bird outside. No. It's *intentional*. I started to pay attention to the time as I was puttering about in the morning making coffee, preparing their plate, etc. Over time I noticed, for example, one particular crow that lands on the utility pole outside - it's the pole that from the top you can see one of my front doors and whether it is open or not. There's a fridge on my porch that blocks the view from the other light pole that is more directly in front of my front door. These poles are across the street. It'll be interesting to note that once the fridge gets disposed of this weekend if the crow will move from one utility pole to the other more direct line of sight pole.

That said, I'm sitting on my porch making this post (their morning Starbucks/Panera doesn't open for another 30 minutes, LOL) I am seeing how the one utility pole that this one crow sits on (every morning by 5 am and leaves once I've opened my front door) actually has a better perspective to see if the door is open from behind the screen door. We'll see.

I've been making notes and observations. I'm going to get a specific journal for crow observations. Enjoy my meager crow eye candy offerings!",18,1751107211.0,crowbro,2,0.96,False

1lmjpsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lmjpsq/another_camper_folktale/,Another Camper Folktale.,"   Man, nothin could ever beat sitting around the campfire on a summer night. 

  The warmth from the fire gently radiating around your shins as your head cocks back to look at the stars in the sky above. 

  The popping and crackling as wood burns and shifts in the pit sending fiery, reddish, golden embers flying up and into your eyes view as you listen to the sounds of rivers, crickets chirping, distant coyotes and wolves yipping and howling at the moon, even the smaller forest animals moving in the brush around you breaking small twigs. 

  It’s peaceful but, very quickly and unexpectedly.. things can go bad for you if you aren’t careful.

  Never go too far off the beaten camper trail, know the kind of animals that are around and by all means, relax to your hearts content but, it’s best to keep an eye and an ear open at all times and if you aren’t camping in a set campground.. for the love of god.. bring a weapon, bring a few. 

  Especially at night.. not only the animals but, weird people who dwell in the forest are real.. that shit happens.

  I can’t tell you how many horror stories I’ve heard and you’ve probably heard your share of scary encounters happening in the woods. 

  A killer, waiting just outside of the fire light for you to enter your tent and fall asleep so they can come make sure you don’t see tomorrow, bears, cougars, mountain lions and any other bigger game sneaking up on you for a late night meal. 

  Hell, while looking up in the sky.. a bat might swoop down directly over your face.. followed by a deep, unsettling crunch just on the other side of the fire… You may look down fast and see something that’s… not exactly human, stopped in a forward crawling motion.. looking directly at you and into your fearful eyes. 

  If you’re lucky.. it won’t move unless you do or.. you take your eyes away from it. 

  A stand off could last for hours as you’re forced to stare at it and feed the fire so you don’t lose sight of it.. for only god and it’s victims know what happens when you can’t see it. 

  My grandfather had an encounter like this once.. said it was deep in the woods on a solo camping trip in… 

  well… I don’t wanna tell you where just in case you get curious and do something stupid, I couldn’t live with myself if someone found.. th-this thing and didn’t survive… Because unfortunately, Not many people do you know?

  Months later you’ll be crossed off as another bear attack because the state just won’t admit this creature exists, just townsfolk’s stories going around, much like big foot and Sasquatch only.. a lot worse… more of a curse and less mythical. 

  My grandfather was feeding the fire for a few hours while staring at it and it didn’t move a single inch… It just waited… and waited.. and waited. 

  Eyes seemingly getting wider and smile.. getting more evil as the fire would start to die.. almost like it was getting excited but, it could’ve also just been the way the dimming light would play with your eyes.

  He got to the last couple logs and had to come up with a plan..  and hearing all the stories he did growing up, he mustered up the courage to just toss em on the fire and slowly back up to his tent.. again.. the creature just… it just waited on the other side of the fire.. not moving.. that same awful face in a crawling position. 

  Reaching back with one hand , he opened his tent, crawled in backwards and slowly started to zip it up, carefully following the motion of the zip so he could keep an eye on it.


  Once he was down to the bottom of the zipper… alls he had to do was go across with it and he’d be safe for the night.. so, in one quick motion.. chest to the ground, one eye watching it.. he swiftly drug his hand across…

  The hunt was officially on.. as he heard the creature crawl with fast …. And heavy prints… barreling through the fire as he heard the logs disperse while it crawled up to the tent… he quickly scooted to the center of the tent and… he never got any sleep that night.. he just watched the shadow of this thing slowly die as the fire died with it. 

  In the morning… you’re safe.. I’m just not sure at exactly what time. 

  He got out of that tent when he could physically see the sun brighten the tent.. when birds started chirping… the sound of distant cars  speeding down backroads were consistent, bikers and hikers on the trail just nearby. 

  Toe, knee and hand prints pressed into ground just outside of his tent.. the charred logs knocked about.. still smoking.

  Tough old guy, while scared out of his mind.. he still made his coffee before he packed up and got out of there.. you on the other hand? May not be so lucky to do the same. 

Be safe.

If you’re only interested in the race report itself, start from “Race Day Morning”.

**Race Overview**

* Race Name: 70.3 Ironman Elsinore
* Location: Elsinore, Denmark
* Date: 22.06.2025
* Weather Conditions: On the day, max air temperature of around 24 °C, around 75° freedom units, wind of around 10 km/h, almost no clouds, water temperature was around 17 °C, or 63 ° freedom.
* Goal: Sub 5



**Pre-Race**

Training summary/preparation phase

I started doing triathlon around 2 years ago, having started cycling one year prior to that. When I started, I didn’t know how to crawl, and hadn’t run in a long time. Within three to four months of swimming three times a week with a local triathlon club, I got a pretty good hold of the crawl. I guess that this rather short learning period was probably due to me taking swimming lessons as a little child. In my first year of training, my best split for an Olympic distance swim was 1:35/100m in open water.

Running was my weakest discipline. This was mainly due to me developing shin splints after basically one month of training. The issues consisted for a long time and were one of the reasons I decided to get a coach in January this year, but more on that later. The shin splints were finally more or less resolved after I got custom insoles to help my arch to stay stabilized in combination with way slower (but longer) runs, which were advocated by my coach. I also changed shoes, which could also have had an impact.

Biking was always my favourite discipline, but when I started, I probably did very little bike workouts in comparison to swimming and running. In the early days, my training on the bike mainly consisted of around two Z2 rides of a combined 100 to maybe 120 km. During the winter, my club held spinning sessions twice a week which I attended during the first season. However, in summer of 2024, I got myself a second hand wahoo kickr, which improved my training on the bike massively.

 

Getting a coach

I decided to sign up for the 70.3 Elsinore in September 2024 as my first ever half distance. After I signed up, I read two books on triathlon training (*Triathlon Training Bible by Joel Friel* and *Triathlon- Erfolg auf der Langdistanz* by Mario Schmidt-Wendling). Until January of 2025, I made my own training plan, using the knowledge I gained from the two books and the internet. I used intervals icu for my planning, which I can highly recommend. During this time, I trained around 9 hours per week.

However, due to the injuries, complications and lack of experience in intensity control etc., I decided to get a coach from January onwards. From then on, I trained around 13 to 16 hours a week.

Usually, I did three run sessions with no intensity to avoid getting shin splints, while building distance over time. The bike sessions were around 4 a week with three of them being some sort of Z2 rides, and one VO2max session that were converted into threshold sessions over time. I usually went to the swimming practice of the club, but towards spring of this year (so around four months before the race), I focussed more on my own workouts and/or the ones provided by my coach. Towards the end, I only swam around once a week, the last three weeks before the race being an exception. In the beginning, my training also featured gym workouts as a form of injury prevention. These slowly faded out towards the last two months.

 

**The Race**

Travel logistics and arrival

With Elsinore only being a one hour train ride away from where I live, the logistics were rather easy to handle. I got my bib number and the backpack already on Friday, which was a good idea, as Saturday was more packed. Bike check-in and the placement of the transition bags was done on Saturday afternoon.

 Pre-race meal and hydration

Since my general diet is already heavily carb-based, I didn’t really change my nutrition during race week. I just kept some gummy bears at hand, so every time I felt the slightest bit of hunger, I would eat a couple. Unfortunately, my gut is quite sensitive to psychological stress, which led to me not eating that well around three days prior to the race. Nevertheless, I felt much better one day before the race, where I kind of made up for the prior deficit.

 

Night before and sleep routine

I filled up my nutrition bottles the day before the race, marking the amount of liquid that I would have to consume on the bike for every 20 minutes (highly recommend that). I calculated to ride around 2.5 hours max and planned to consume 110 g/h of carbs. I had two bottles of High5 carb mix to which I added one tablet of High5 electrolytes. In addition to that, I had a flexible bottle, that I planned to use to pour the cups from the aid station into, to avoid getting side ache from pausing and drinking the whole cup at once. This bottle was also filled the night before with one electrolyte tablet. All bottles were stored in the fridge during the night before the race.

Someone told me that they would adapt their sleeping schedule in race week to waking and going to bed earlier to accommodate for the early(-ish) start. I tried to follow this advice. Although during the week, I often felt quite exhausted, and was doubting the effectiveness of this procedure, especially being really tired the day before the race, it all worked out in the end as I fell asleep around 9pm the night before race day and felt super fresh and ready on the big day.

 

Morning routine: breakfast

As advised by my coach, I kept the breakfast the same as usual. For me, this meant three to four slices of toast with some butter and jam. Additionally, some coffee and water.

 

Race Day morning

In the morning of race day, I arrived around one hour prior to my swimming start (yes, I know). This was due to the bad train connections with the other possibility to arrive two hours earlier. Upon arrival, I placed my carb mix bottles on the bike, and the flexible bottle in the run bag. A stranger kindly let me use their pump, as the pumps provided did not work.

Then came the worst part of my day. Already in the train I had the urge to use the bathroom. Since I knew (or thought) that there were plenty of porta-potties at the venue, I didn’t go on the train. Big mistake. Every one of them had at least a 20 minute long que in front of them. I chose to stand in line for the ones in the transition area, still with my bag in hand and no wetsuit on, while they already called in the third group of swimmers into the pre-swim area, me being part of the second swimming group.

In my desperate situation, I asked the 5 people in front of me if I could skip the line, since my start was rapidly approaching, to which they thankfully agreed. After having done my business, I went to the swim start. While the speaker was already hyping up the crowd, I rushed through the pre-swim areas to finally arrive among my group of swimmers. After having put on the wetsuit, I saw Heather from the GTN channel, which was quite nice to see and gave me even more of a boost. Generally, the few minutes before my swim start felt exciting, as this was finally the day that I worked so hard and made so many sacrifices for.

Walking down the pier to the swim start, the anxiety and nervousness turned into dedication and willingness to show what I’m capable of doing.

 

Swim (1.9 km)

As the swim was in a harbour, the water was quite calm. The only waves were from the competitors and the jet skis. The water temperature felt good - neither too warm nor too cold. There were some jellyfish, also those who sting, which luckily didn’t affect me.

The start was split up into five or so groups based on your estimated swimming time. Every 6 seconds, three people would start.

I knew that I was prone to swimming too fast in the beginning of a race. I therefore focussed on my technique and on catching someone else’s feet during the first couple of hundred meters. It was quite difficult to draft in the water, as there were many buoys, which made it hard to find someone to draft of.

The swim was honestly quite confusing to me, after the first four buoys I had trouble mentally locating myself in the swim. Also, the pack didn’t take the most optimal route, which made it even more confusing.

When the buoy at around 400m to go finally came around, I was quite relieved, as the pacing turned out quite well in the end. As I felt a bit nauseous, I stopped at around 300m to go to get some air, and to spit some sea water. After this brief break, I continued, and quickly found myself in T1. The swim time was just shy of 32 minutes, which was a bit slower than expected, but still alright.

 

Transition 1

Elsinore has quite a long T1, with around 600 to 800m from the end of the swim to the start of the bike course. As I didn’t feel too well, I didn’t take my planned post-swim gel right there, but postponed it to after I changed into my bike gear (taking on bib number, helmet, sunglasses, spare tyre, socks and shoes).

 

Bike (90 km)

 The bike course at Elsinore is a rolling course with around 400 meters of elevation. It’s a two-loop course, although the loop starts around 10km from the venue site.

Overall, there was little wind, especially for Denmark. It was pretty perfect weather overall with temperatures just reaching 20, maybe 21 °C on the bike leg.

As mentioned before, I planned to take on 110 g/h, I had three emergency gels with caffeine, but I didn’t end up using them. My nutrition strategy was to take on one electrolyte bottle at the first aid station, which saved me the weight of one bottle for the first 30 or so kilometres.

My target power was just below 290W, with me being around 80kg. In the best case, this would mean a bike split of around 2h15

I pretty quickly ended up in a group of around 6 people with a similar speed. Although some of those people were blatantly drafting (literally sitting on my back wheel), I tried to keep the legal distance as often as possible. This was sometimes difficult though, especially during inclines. Although there were some race marshals around, nobody of this group received a penalty.

I felt really good during the whole bike section. The course features some roads through small forests, which not only shield from the sun, but are also cooler than just asphalt roads.

On the second round, it was more difficult to get something from the aid stations, as there were more people on the road. Since I had my carb mix, and some of the electrolytes left, I just took on some water to spray it down on me for cooling. In hindsight, I probably should have taken on one more bottle of electrolytes, but more on that later.

My group paced well throughout the course, with the last 5k being the only exception. I surged ahead, as I felt that I had the legs for it.

The bike split ended up being around 2h 12 minutes, with me being in the top 3% overall. I was super happy with that. Especially the last couple of hundred meters gave me a big adrenaline boost, as there were so many people cheering. With that boost, I headed into T2.

 

Transition 2 

 I felt fresh and ready for the run after dismounting the bike. Went ahead to rack it up and continued to the transition bags. My shoehorn came in very handy in T2, as I had tied my shoes before the race. I then grabbed my flexible water bottle, my gels, my cap, put on some sun cream, and headed towards the run course.

 

Run (21.1 km)

 The run course was a 3.5 loop course around the old town of Elsinore, and the famous Elsinore castle. There were many aid stations, and I never felt like I was waiting for one to come.

With 24°C being one of the hotter (if not hottest) days in Denmark, they had sprinklers and people with hoses set up to cool you off. I used all of those installations extensively, while also pouring down water on myself in the aid stations.

I planned to do a 5 min/k, or around 300W (Stryd foot sensor) half marathon.

My flexible bottle strategy worked out well, although not perfectly. During the first lap, it was quite easy to drink, but once the bottle was empty, the filling thereof was a bit harder than anticipated. I could have stopped or slowed down more to pour more water/electrolyte into the bottle, but I honestly didn’t feel like I needed to (again, more on that later). Filling up one or two cups per aid station was around the best I could do.

I planned to take on one 23g gel every 5 km, which I didn’t adhere to, as I struggled to not get side ache during the first lap. In the end, I believe I took on four or five gels during the whole run, which was probably too little.

First loop went by in a blink of an eye. I knew that many people would pass me on the run, since I am a decent swimmer and good rider but a bad runner, so it didn’t bother me to be one of the slowest people in the field at that time. The first half of the second lap was mentally still doable, as the 10k mark was during this lap. After hitting 10k though, it was quite hard to push on, with the advent of the third lap finally being a mental achievement. During the last 5k I tried to increase my speed. Although it felt harder than before, my watch tells me that there wasn’t a stark difference in pace until the last around 1.5k.

And then, finally, the red carpet came around.

The finish line experience was great, I felt like I was flying. There were crowds cheering, and I felt all kinds of emotions during these last couple of meters.

In the end, I managed to clock in at around 4:37 – a time I could not have dreamt of. I was, and still am, very proud of this result. One year of dedicated training led to this.

 

**Post-Race**

I took some time in the finish area before heading out to my family and friends who cheered for me during the entire event.

After sitting down for around 20 or so minutes, I started shivering and felt really cold. A sign of – so I’m told - either under fuelling, or lack of hydration.

This problem probably already started on the bike with me only taking on one bottle of electrolytes. During the run, the fuelling and nutrition wasn’t optimal as well, so I’m quite happy that I didn’t bonk before the finish line. Fuelling is definitely something I will take more seriously for the next race.

 

What worked well?

·       Training: Getting a wahoo kickr helped me to bring my bike game to a whole new level. I bought it second hand and saved a couple hundred dollars, but it still worked like a charm. I would recommend anyone who’s serious about their training to get themselves a home trainer for the bike.

·       Training: Training and Taper worked really well. I will definitely keep many of my runs, and bike rides in Z2, with some intensity mixed in. Focussing on slow (yes, slower than you would expect) runs helped me to stay injury free while still developing on the run.

·       Race Preparation: Getting the bib number and backpack already on Friday saved me some trouble. I would do that again next time.

·       During the race: Two bottles with carb mix worked well, including the 20 min markings on the bottles. Also, waiting for the first aid station to get an electrolyte bottle was a good idea (considering the still mild climate, I wouldn’t do that for hotter races)

·       During the race: Flexible bottle for the run worked well. Easy to pour in cups from aid stations due to big opening, easy to squeeze (meaning less breaks in breathing).

 

What didn’t work?

·       Arriving only one hour before the swim start. It gives you too little time in case something doesn’t go to plan. I would advise you to be there at least 1.5 hours before.

·       I was lucky to rely on someone else’s pump. For the next race, I will bring my own.

·       Getting on too little hydration and gels on both bike and run. Potentially, I could have reached a better time when the fuelling was more adequate and more dialled-in. Since I didn’t do many long runs with intensity, the nutrition aspect in running was lacking.

·       Nutrition during race-week wasn’t optimal. I hope that for the next race, my gut will be less sensitive, but I guess some things lie out of our control.

 

Thoughts on the venue:

Overall, I had a really great experience in Elsinore. The athletes’ garden was apparently one of the best ones out there, according to my multiple-ironman club mate. Personally, I was missing some shade in the athlete’s garden, as the sun was just burning down on us that day. Another thing I would have improved is the accessibility of water, as there weren’t many places where one could fill up one’s water bottle. Also, I found it odd that there weren’t any dedicated electrolyte bottles in the garden. Other than that, the whole thing felt super organized and well thought-through.

 

What’s next?

Many people have asked my whether I would switch to the full distance now. And honestly, I don’t really want to. I think the 70.3 it the perfect distance to race, and not just to endure (yes, I know, triathlon is still an endurance sport, but you get my point). Since I’m a strong cyclist, I might focus on bike races, or bike projects for the near future, but I will definitely race other 70.3 again. There’s for example the 70.3 in Zell am See in Austria which I believe must be one of the most beautiful half distances out there. Maybe I’ll also try to go sub 4 at a very fast course such as Knokke-Heist in Belgium.

I guess time will tell.

And then we talked about his STD test results. I've been celibate since we met, and I got tested and came up negative. Him in particular, because he straight up bragged that he was breeding random guys on vacation while not being on prep. Even though he had the medication, he just didn't want to take it. So, he's out here being sexually reckless (I said what I said). Said he just got tested, and that he'd get back to me when his results got back. 'Cause we both expressed wanting to meet up to catch up on life, etc. We aren't compatible for dating, but we still get along well. Or so I thought. 

  
Now we didn't have penetrative sex. He just gave me a really good handjob, not even a blowjob. He also said he doesn't kiss or eat ass either. So, it was relatively safe play. And this was back in February. We haven't met since then due to work reasons, and him going on a month-long fuck-cation cruise. 

  
That conversation was 3/4 weeks ago. And since then, I've sent him messages, just kinda checking in that type of thing. And he hasn't responded. But it shows he's read some of my messages. We were talking, exchanging snaps and then he suddenly just stopped responding. And when he does respond, he's very locked in. Making jokes, sending pics, etc. I also saw he was on grindr too. I think he went on another trip, judging by how his profile looked. So, I'm wondering what the deal is. Now when he got back from his trip, he said he was feeling a little under the weather. He was also under the weather when we first met for coffee back in January. I remember he had a cough. And I'm thinking that his results should have come in by now. 

  
I'm just now putting some things together, and it seems a little fishy. That soon after we have the STD results talk he just ghosts me. And he's asked me to bottom for him, but I keep refusing him. One, I'm a top, and two I don't bottom. Does this seem weird to anyone else? Do you think he caught something and doesn't wanna say? Is this odd? I need actual advice here y'all.

Bonus brownie points, should you know where that's from!

As a little preamble of sorts, and I guess you could say a warning, let me state the obvious: this advert is *long* and yes, it *could* be much, much shorter. However, the reason it *is* so long is because a lot of the things that I talk about here are matters concerning compatibility. Meaning, whether there even *is* a point to us taking this into the DMs. So! Let me ask you this: would you rather waste fifteen minutes reading this, or an entire week worth of planning? I leave the choice up to you!

In any case, if I didn't scare you off, you may as well get yourself a cup of tea, or coffee, and get comfortable!

Now, let's carry on, shall we?

\----✂︎-- Basic Introductions and Expectations! --✂︎----

So, I am a 24 year old female roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands also known as Eastern Europe! To be more specific, I come from Poland and this puts me in the CEST time zone. I have been engaged in this hobby for pretty much half my life at this point, and while there's no such thing as perfect, I consider myself to be at least decent! Other than writing, I also love tea, reading, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy fiction of all sorts, as well as anything that's got fur and walks on four legs!

Oh, and I also happen to be a transgender woman. If you've got an issue with that, do me a kindness, and do not message me!

Now, let me get some things out of the way, first:

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older; this has got nothing to do with writing ability, and everything with my personal comfort. So, I will not make any exceptions. At the same time, I prefer to write with people close to my age, so my upper limit is around 35 years old.
2. At the moment, I prefer not to write with men. Sorry!
3. As of currently, I only write on Discord and nowhere else.
4. I require the reply rate of **at least** once per day, and I also highly prefer that multiple replies a day are possible at least every now and then. But, **no**, by no means do I require that every single day, and naturally, real-life always comes first.
5. I am advanced literate; I will elaborate on this more further into the advert, but my replies typically take between 300-600 words and may even reach 1000 words and I am looking for people on a similar level.
6. Strong OOC contact is required; half of the fun in this hobby comes to me from the OOC fangirling and brainstorming that surrounds it, and yes: I do prefer to befriend my writing partners. While that should come about naturally, I will already tell you that we will not be a good fit if you are opposed to that.
7. I am against the use of face-claims of any kind, and it's a deal-breaker, even if it's to be a one-sided arrangement.
8. NFSW the way it is usually understood is unlikely; I highly prefer fade-to-black. Should you message me from an account with *any* amount of ERPer content, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Please note that while I am more than happy to elaborate on any of these, none of them really are up to discussion, debate or meaningful compromise. You will particularly make a very poor first impression, should you lead with point no. 8. I really mean it, too. You will only end up wasting your time, should you message me from a smut account.

Another thing that's important is schedule compatibility. To put it in a way that's short and sweet: if you are only going to be available prior to 12 PM my time, or after 10 PM my time, this is not going to work. As the planning stage tends to take a while with me even at the best of times, this is not negotiable. So, please take that in mind before you decide to message me.

I would also appreciate if you had a good amount of free time on weekends; I can usually do some back-and-forth during the week, but it's on the weekends that I can promise the most of my undivided attention.

Thaaaat... should be it! Now, let us carry on!

\----✂︎-- What do I want to write! --✂︎----

So, what is it that I want to write?

Adventure! A(n epic) fantasy tale that will be equally rife with the power of love and friendship, but also drama and angst! What I want to write is a plot-driven piece of fiction with an expansive ensemble cast of diverse and vibrant characters with a dense plot-line, rich lore and tons of world-building! The kind of story that I wish to write would be something akin to a DnD adventure, with a band of heroes traveling from town to town, braving perilous wilderness, conquering ancient dungeons, meeting new friends and allies and defeating fearsome foes, while a powerful evil looms behind the horizon! With the 'twist', of course, that all this should happen within a world that has at least reached the steam engine!

Or, at least, that's the general gist. The details are for us to work out together!

What is also important is that, as a collaborative writer, I wish to build everything in our little story from the ground-up... except for monsters, creatures and other sorts of beasts. In this case, I am no stranger to shamelessly stealing preexisting concepts! It is not a perfect approach, but I don't believe in perfect, and I would love to write with someone interested in the same!

This also means that if you have a highly fleshed out world and/or story idea of your own, I will not be very interested. Still, I wish you the best of luck with it!

I have mentioned that what I want to write is post-industrial fantasy. Still, I should let you know that my brand of modern (or urban) fantasy is still closer to medieval fantasy classics like Lord of the Rings, rather than your average urban fantasy YA as I still make liberal use of many tropes, cliches and storytelling tropes present in the former!

How advanced should our setting be? Let's discuss that together! So long the world has at least reached the early industrial revolution, and so long it hasn't achieved quick, and convenient interstellar travel! I am open to anything in-between!

Oh, and I love a strong element of action so it is best that you enjoy writing out action scenes, and feel at least somewhat comfortable AND confident while writing them. I am also not the right partner for you, if you care much for realism in the aspect. The action I write *would* be pretty grounded compared to, say, Dragon Ball Z, but by objective standards... not very. Do expect anime/action movie sort of BS while coming in!

Oh, and I may want to spell it out as it has been an issue before: I am really not interested in primarily character-driven stories. Characters give life to the story, but I *need* a central, larger-than-life conflict to move the story along, and I do prefer for there to be very high stakes. It's not everyone's yum, but it is my yum, so just take that in mind!

Now, let us get onto...!

\----✂︎-- Writing! --✂︎----

Ah, writing – that is, the bread and butter of this hobby.

I have already talked briefly about it in the 'about me' section, but let me elaborate a bit more. As I said, my replies typically range between 300-600 words, with my larger responses reaching up to 1000 words and sometimes even more, and no, I couldn't tell you how much is that in paragraphs. Still, I don't believe in quotas, nor do I believe in padding the replies to fit said quotas and my approach to the beautiful, flowery kind of language is that it is like salt when used in cooking. Amazing when you use it in moderation, and not-so-amazing when you just dump a whole kilogram into the pot.

Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I require the same of my writing partners.

Still, while I do agree some degree of flexibility is required, this only goes so far with me. I generally prefer replies do not get much smaller than 150 words at the least, and no matter the situation, I will not accept a response that is only a couple sentences, or a one-liner.

I am happy to exchange writing samples in private messages, but that is entirely up to you. I don't require them myself and it's rare that I ever ask if not asked first.

\----✂︎-- The Characters! --✂︎----

So, the most important thing is that I create and tailor all my characters from scratch for every single story and I prefer to write with those who share a similar approach.

That also means that what sort of lead character I will come up is anyone's guess! That said, a couple key elements are almost certain to be the case. One, she is going to be a woman. Second, she will likely be in the age range from between late 20s to late 30s, and third, she will likely be a skilled combatant of some sorts, and fourth, she is going to skew onto the heroic side even if she starts out more morally gray... and all four points are what I require of your characters, as well. *Maybe* except for the age part, as young adult MCs aren't necessarily a deal-breaker (so long they are at least 21), but they aren't my preference and I cannot promise that I can be convinced to go down that road.

And, yes, the fourth point is unfortunately a hard requirement. While I love morally gray or amoral characters that stay that way through the story, I have to say that, unfortunately, I do not enjoy them as lead characters specifically.

Overall though, it is a requirement that you feel comfortable writing any characters that may vary by gender, age\*, personality, social background, romantic orientation, as well as moral alignment. Is it a tall order? Perhaps! But, I do offer the same on my end! I also simply love the process of character creation, and I seek those matching my energy!

\*That said, all major characters ought to be at least 21 years old of age.

I should also say a word or two about romance, as that makes or breaks the hobby for many people if not most of them. I love to write it, I love to have it, and I probably wouldn't enjoy a fully platonic roleplay, ***but*** I also do not want it as the centerpiece of the story. It can be important (and it should be, if our main characters are involved together) and it can take a lot of page time, but it cannot be the main plot and it shouldn't be the only thing you care for about in the story, either.

I also do prefer slow-burn, especially as far as the leading duo is concerned. Now, I will not *force* it if it doesn't make sense or requires active meta-sabogating, but I will naturally lean into it, so please be aware!

I also have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, *but* I also prefer partners able and willing to also write FxM/MxF and MxM ships for the other characters. Although, the MxM isn't a deal-breaker if you'd rather not write that or do not feel confident with it.

\----✂︎-- My writing dislikes and what I prefer to avoid! --✂︎----

Okay, so this is going to be a more cynical section.

Still, as a fair amount of my dislikes happen to be staples on the roleplaying scene, I prefer to get them out of the way as to help some of you from wasting your time. So, the things that I prefer to avoid in my stories are:

Fandoms, pre-industrial fantasy settings, sanitized immoral groups, fluff/grimdark extremes, slice-of-life (as a genre), vampire/werewolf stories, arranged marriage, enemies-to-lovers, the Masquerade (when the existence of magic is a secret), magic being banned setting-wide, stories with no true heroes nor villains, police/military settings (as the primary background), school settings, stories taking place in a single location, settings based off the real world (e.x. HP, Marvel, PJO), love at the first sight, large age gaps involving young adults, shock content for its own sake,

... and that is it! Probably.

In truth, there are very few storytelling tropes and conventions I would never use, so I am more than happy to elaborate on any of this! For example, the reason I dislike 'enemies to lovers' is because this either necessitates for romance to be the centerpiece of the story, or for the 'to lovers' part to happen very quickly. But, should it happen naturally between side characters, I will probably love it and eat it all up! *Still*, I wouldn't lead with any of the tropes mentioned above when messaging me, regardless, as I either dislike them, am very particular about them or may simply not be in the mood for some of them at the moment.

As for what I actually enjoy, my advert thus far has hopefully given you at least a rough idea, and I would be unfortunately beside myself to make an organized list of what I want and do enjoy. Especially since I want each story to be unique!

(That said, I would love to write with a fellow Final Fantasy fan!)

Hopefully this section hasn't discouraged you, and if it has, then I'm glad it at least saved you some time!

\----✂︎-- Fin! --✂︎----

So, that pretty much does it!

Anyway, when you choose to message me, I would like to know: how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, the time-zone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable enough to share!), any potential story triggers and, most important. some starting pitch for a story! Now, to be clear, I don't expect for you to come at me with anything detailed! Especially not when this advert provides no concrete ideas in and of itself. All I really want is just a starting point for the two of us to gauge our compatibility.

If I managed to pique your interest, then I would love to have your message! Otherwise, I hope you have a great day, or night!

Still, while I do agree some degree of flexibility is required, this only goes so far with me. I generally prefer replies do not get much smaller than 150 words at the least, and no matter the situation, I will not accept a response that is only a couple sentences, or a one-liner.

I am happy to exchange writing samples in private messages, but that is entirely up to you. I don't require them myself and it's rare that I ever ask if not asked first.

\----✂︎-- The Characters! --✂︎----

So, the most important thing is that I create and tailor all my characters from scratch for every single story and I prefer to write with those who share a similar approach.

That also means that what sort of lead character I will come up is anyone's guess! That said, a couple key elements are almost certain to be the case. One, she is going to be a woman. Second, she will likely be in the age range from between late 20s to late 30s, and third, she will likely be a skilled combatant of some sorts, and fourth, she is going to skew onto the heroic side even if she starts out more morally gray... and all four points are what I require of your characters, as well. *Maybe* except for the age part, as young adult MCs aren't necessarily a deal-breaker (so long they are at least 21), but they aren't my preference and I cannot promise that I can be convinced to go down that road.

And, yes, the fourth point is unfortunately a hard requirement. While I love morally gray or amoral characters that stay that way through the story, I have to say that, unfortunately, I do not enjoy them as lead characters specifically.

Overall though, it is a requirement that you feel comfortable writing any characters that may vary by gender, age\*, personality, social background, romantic orientation, as well as moral alignment. Is it a tall order? Perhaps! But, I do offer the same on my end! I also simply love the process of character creation, and I seek those matching my energy!

\*That said, all major characters ought to be at least 21 years old of age.

I should also say a word or two about romance, as that makes or breaks the hobby for many people if not most of them. I love to write it, I love to have it, and I probably wouldn't enjoy a fully platonic roleplay, ***but*** I also do not want it as the centerpiece of the story. It can be important (and it should be, if our main characters are involved together) and it can take a lot of page time, but it cannot be the main plot and it shouldn't be the only thing you care for about in the story, either.

I also do prefer slow-burn, especially as far as the leading duo is concerned. Now, I will not *force* it if it doesn't make sense or requires active meta-sabogating, but I will naturally lean into it, so please be aware!

I also have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, *but* I also prefer partners able and willing to also write FxM/MxF and MxM ships for the other characters. Although, the MxM isn't a deal-breaker if you'd rather not write that or do not feel confident with it.

\----✂︎-- My writing dislikes and what I prefer to avoid! --✂︎----

Okay, so this is going to be a more cynical section.

Still, as a fair amount of my dislikes happen to be staples on the roleplaying scene, I prefer to get them out of the way as to help some of you from wasting your time. So, the things that I prefer to avoid in my stories are:

Fandoms, pre-industrial fantasy settings, sanitized immoral groups, fluff/grimdark extremes, slice-of-life (as a genre), vampire/werewolf stories, arranged marriage, enemies-to-lovers, the Masquerade (when the existence of magic is a secret), magic being banned setting-wide, stories with no true heroes nor villains, police/military settings (as the primary background), school settings, stories taking place in a single location, settings based off the real world (e.x. HP, Marvel, PJO), love at the first sight, large age gaps involving young adults, shock content for its own sake,

... and that is it! Probably.

In truth, there are very few storytelling tropes and conventions I would never use, so I am more than happy to elaborate on any of this! For example, the reason I dislike 'enemies to lovers' is because this either necessitates for romance to be the centerpiece of the story, or for the 'to lovers' part to happen very quickly. But, should it happen naturally between side characters, I will probably love it and eat it all up! *Still*, I wouldn't lead with any of the tropes mentioned above when messaging me, regardless, as I either dislike them, am very particular about them or may simply not be in the mood for some of them at the moment.

As for what I actually enjoy, my advert thus far has hopefully given you at least a rough idea, and I would be unfortunately beside myself to make an organized list of what I want and do enjoy. Especially since I want each story to be unique!

(That said, I would love to write with a fellow Final Fantasy fan!)

Hopefully this section hasn't discouraged you, and if it has, then I'm glad it at least saved you some time!

\----✂︎-- Fin! --✂︎----

So, that pretty much does it!

Anyway, when you choose to message me, I would like to know: how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, the time-zone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable enough to share!), any potential story triggers and, most important. some starting pitch for a story! Now, to be clear, I don't expect for you to come at me with anything detailed! Especially not when this advert provides no concrete ideas in and of itself. All I really want is just a starting point for the two of us to gauge our compatibility.

If I managed to pique your interest, then I would love to have your message! Otherwise, I hope you have a great day, or night!

* Do it for a dollar/Would you do it for a dollar? - Something like fiverr but more social oriented, people might do different stuff for a dollar, like drink a glass or drink or vodka. But it's too dangerous to create and liability is high
* You got a dollar? - something like ""buy me a coffee"" but instead people would beg for a dollar like beggers on the street
* Selling fog - Literally selling fog in jars, but I think it was already done
* iEgg - Literal egg with Apple logo for 999$, but can't use Apple logo.
* Don’t meet in person - dating app that encourages you not to meet in person. like having a girlfriend or boyfriend online. But it makes no sense
* Stupid people repellent - Like a mace spray with label on it ""Stupid people repellent""
* Hangover - An app where you post only drunk photos. People don't want to post drunk photos of themselves of course
* RentACock - Renting a dick on demand, but prostitution
* OnlyHaters - OnlyFans but for haters. Hate is a crime so that's that.
* News excerpt summary - Instead of reading huge news articles you get a summary of 2-3 sentences. But it's hard to earn money
* Bluetooth chat - Just like normal chat but using bluetooth, meaning that you have to be nearby. That can be creepy.
* Social network where all is opposite. Like downvotes are good… It makes no sense
* Real movie spoilers - Website or YT channel where you spoil movies hard like: IronMan dies at the end, Thanos also dies and so on. People don't want movies to be spoiled. I can't watch that many movies
* Parfume that smells like pussy or dick - but hard to recreate. It's for fetish community
* Picture book for adults - you know those picture books for kids, but this one be for adults with dicks, boos and vaginas
* SatanMail - Like SantaMail but from Satan. It takes a lot of time to create letters, ship them and fulfill orders.
* Dick pic sending app - SnapChat in a nutshell but clearly for dick sending
* Porn synchronisation- you know how cartoons are being synchronised to native lang… you do it for porn clips for you language. But not legal since it is content stealing",36,1751106721.0,SideProject,33,0.8,False

I’ve been using an HP laptop for most of my company work, a G9 with terrible battery life and huge heating issues, but recently we were given the option to use our own personal computers. So I decided to set everything up on my MacBook Pro M1, which I’ve had for about a year and not using.

So far, I’m loving the experience. Especially the incredible battery life and performance, even when it’s not plugged in.

My day-to-day workflow is heavily based on Microsoft Office apps, mainly Outlook and Excel, with occasional use of Word. I also use Postman, Microsoft Teams, lots of Chrome tabs, and have video calls throughout the day. I do most of the time overtime so at nights i also go outside and casually work while drinking coffee etc.

Now, here's where I need advice: I’m considering upgrading, not because the current device isn’t performing well, but because the keyboard layout is in English, and half of my work is in my native language. This mismatch sometimes causes issues with communication and Excel formulas. So I’m thinking about getting a Mac with a localized keyboard layout here in my country.

Fortunately, MacBook prices in my country are much closer to U.S. prices (unlike iPhones, which cost 3x more), so upgrading is not out of the question.

I'm torn between getting a second-hand MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip (which might help with large Excel files—I occasionally work with over 300,000 rows) and not sure this is a good idea, or going for a newer MacBook Air with the M4 chip. I’ve watched a few comparison videos, but none really reflect my specific kind of workload, so I’m still undecided.

For reference, my current machine is a 16GB RAM / 250GB storage MacBook Pro M1, with 89% battery health and 102 cycles. The battery life isstill  phenomenal, and I’d hate to lose that in an upgrade.

What I’m looking for is something similarly portable and long-lasting, but just a bit more future-proof and with a keyboard suited to my language. I really love the Touch Bar, but I know it’s nearly extinct on newer Apple Silicon models, so it’s not a dealbreaker.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

They convey information clearly and then fade into the background. Others, however, possess a distinct energy, a personality that leaps off the page and grabs your attention. The[ Voltage retro script typeface](https://weandthecolor.com/voltage-retro-script-typeface-laura-worthington/43372) by Laura Worthington is a prime example of the latter. This isn't just a collection of letters; it's a full-fledged creative toolkit designed to inject a powerful dose of vintage cool into any project. It captures the unapologetic confidence of a bygone era, masterfully re-engineered for the modern designer.

The **Voltage retro script typeface** immediately brings to mind the bold aesthetics of the mid-20th century. Think about the gleaming chrome on a classic car, the buzzing neon of a roadside diner sign, or the confident lettering on an old-school machinist’s receipt. It’s a font that feels both handcrafted and mechanically precise. Laura Worthington, its creator, didn't just aim to copy an old style. Instead, she set out to build a highly practical and remarkably legible script font that still sizzles with a unique, electrifying character. The result is a typeface that is as versatile as it is striking.

# A Closer Look at the Voltage Typeface DNA

So, what makes the **Voltage retro script typeface** tick? At its core, it is a connecting script font built on a foundation of uniformity and elegance. The letterforms are designed to flow together seamlessly, creating a cohesive and natural look. Unlike many decorative scripts that can be difficult to read, Voltage prioritizes legibility without sacrificing its energetic personality.

This beautiful vintage-inspired typeface is offered in three distinct weights: Light, Regular, and Bold. This gives you, the designer, incredible flexibility.

* **Voltage Light:** Perfect for a more subtle, refined touch. It works wonderfully for subheadings or elegant pull quotes.
* **Voltage Regular:** The workhorse of the family. It’s balanced, clear, and carries the font's core personality with confidence.
* **Voltage Bold:** This weight makes a statement. It’s ideal for impactful headlines, powerful logos, and any design that needs to command attention.

Each weight maintains the font's essential character. Consequently, you can mix and match them within a single project for a dynamic and harmonious typographic hierarchy.

# The Vision of an Award-Winning Designer: Laura Worthington

A font is only as good as the vision behind it. In this case, the creator is Laura Worthington, an award-winning type designer known for her meticulous craftsmanship and artistic flair. Worthington’s work often explores the intersection of historical inspiration and contemporary usability. With Voltage, her goal was clear: to craft a retro font that was not only aesthetically pleasing but also immensely practical.

Her inspiration came from a fascinating mix of 1950s and 1960s Americana. She studied the lettering on everything from advertising and commercial signage to automobiles and gas stations. This deep appreciation for the era's visual language is evident in every curve and connection of the **Voltage retro script typeface**. It’s a font born from genuine passion and a deep understanding of typographic history.

# The Ultimate Creative Toolkit: Unleashing Voltage’s Features

Here is where the **Voltage retro script typeface** truly sets itself apart. It’s packed with an astonishing number of features that give you near-limitless control over your designs. This isn’t a one-size-fits-all font; it's a system for building custom lettering that feels unique and personal.

Have you ever found the perfect font, only to wish you could just tweak one or two letters to make it fit better? Voltage was built to solve that exact problem.

**Galvanizing Swashes and Alternates**

The true power of this typeface lies in its extensive set of swashes and alternates. These are alternative letterforms that you can swap in to add decorative flair and create a custom-lettered look. Voltage comes equipped with:

* **154 Unique Swashes:** These are decorative strokes that can be attached to the beginning or end of letters. With all the possible combinations, they result in a staggering **348 swash variations**. Imagine adding a long, elegant tail to the last letter of a word in a logo or a short, punchy flourish to a headline.
* **39 Alternates:** These are different styles for specific characters. Perhaps you want a slightly more expressive ""t"" or a more compact ""s."" The alternates provide these options, allowing you to fine-tune your text to perfection.
* **15 Ligatures:** Ligatures are special characters that combine two or more letters into a single, more harmonious glyph, such as ""th"" or ""ff."" This enhances the natural, hand-lettered flow of the script.

Using these OpenType features, you can transform a simple line of text into a piece of bespoke art. The font can feel fun and friendly one moment, then dominant and powerful the next, all depending on how you utilize its features.

# Where to Use the Voltage Retro Script Typeface for Maximum Impact

Because of its blend of personality and legibility, the **Voltage retro script typeface** is incredibly versatile. It’s a fantastic choice for any project aiming for a retro, vintage, or handcrafted feel.

Here are just a few ideas for brand identity design using retro fonts:

* **Logo Design:** Voltage is a natural fit for creating memorable, high-impact logos. Its script form adds a personal touch, making a brand feel more approachable and authentic.
* **Branding & Packaging:** For products like craft beer, artisanal coffee, heritage clothing, or organic foods, this font can instantly communicate quality and a story-driven identity.
* **Headlines and Titles:** Whether on a website, in a magazine, or on a poster, Voltage makes for striking headlines that draw the reader in.
* **Social Media Graphics:** In a crowded feed, a graphic using Voltage will stand out. Use it for pull quotes, announcements, or promotional images to create a cohesive and stylish social media presence.
* **Apparel Design:** T-shirts, hats, and other merchandise printed with Voltage slogans or branding have an immediate retro appeal that is consistently popular.

Think about any brand that wants to convey energy, nostalgia, and craftsmanship. The **Voltage retro script typeface** provides the perfect typographic voice for that message.

# Your Questions About Voltage, Answered

**Is the Voltage font difficult to use?**  
Not at all. While it has many advanced features, the base font is simple to install and use in any design software. To access the swashes and alternates, you'll use the Glyphs panel in programs like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, or InDesign.

**Where can I get the Voltage retro script typeface?**  
The Voltage font family is a premium typeface available for purchase from Laura Worthington's official website and other reputable font foundries online. Always ensure you are purchasing from an authorized seller to receive a proper license.

**What is the best way to pair Voltage with other fonts?**  
Because Voltage is so expressive, it pairs best with a simple, clean sans-serif or a sturdy slab-serif for body text. This creates a clear visual hierarchy and allows Voltage to be the star of the show without overwhelming the design. Fonts like Proxima Nova, Montserrat, or Rockwell are excellent companions.

Ultimately, the **Voltage retro script typeface** is more than just a font. It’s a bridge to a classic era of design, retooled with the power and flexibility that today's creative professionals demand. It offers a unique combination of friendly energy and bold confidence, all wrapped in a package of impeccable craftsmanship. The next time your project needs a jolt of personality and a touch of timeless cool, you know which typeface to reach for. The only question left is: what will you create with it?

I thought the family business was the problem, but now I’m starting to realize there’s something deeper going on. I hate this new job so much that I feel disgusted when I look at myself in the mirror.

The family business is seasonal, but I still have to manage it during my bank job. That means skipping lunch breaks to call clients and juggle logistics, and it’s draining me physically and mentally.

On top of that, my girlfriend has been making things worse. She shows up after work, says she just wants coffee, and then keeps me out for hours even when I tell her I need to rest. It’s starting to feel like her mom is pushing her to stay with me because of the money,both from the job and the family business.

I want to break up, but every time we argue, she finds a way to break me down emotionally. I feel trapped.

When I finally get home, I have more business tasks to handle, and then she gets upset if we don’t go out. The only time I have to myself is when I sleep. That’s it.

I hate the job. I hate the way my life is turning out. I’ve even started having thoughts of self-harm. It feels like all the sacrifices I’ve made have only led to a worse version of life. And the worst part? People would kill for this job. So I feel like I can’t even complain.

I don’t know what to do anymore.
