1jq8r2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/HSVpositive/comments/1jq8r2a/nerve_pain_journey/,Nerve pain journey,"Hey guys, I made this account to document symptoms and get help. I have done alot of reading and I have concluded that doctors (most of the time) are dismissive and invalidating. I had no idea what herpes would be like, when you read online, its just people telling you not to worry and nothing more than 2 weeks of mild symptoms. LOL

I(28M) had my first outbreak passed on to me by someone that didnt disclose and blocked me when i told them. This was in december 2024

Medical history: 

I have had kidney problems when i was a child. I used to have yearly check ups. Doctor said id be fine as long as i drink alot of water and avoid sugary juices.

Used to have eczema behind my knees and on my arm as a child. Medication and strong will power cleared this up for a long time. It recently popped up behind my knees in 2023, in jan 2024 it appeared on the right side of my neck. It was very strange and couldnt manage to get rid of it. It was controlled in one area tho. 

Pretty sure i had chicken pox as a child and got the vaccines etc.

In general, I ate alot of chicken, meat, rice vegetables, fruits. I drank alot of water and i love desserts. I drink tea everyday and coffee every week. I like playing sports and hit the gym often. I have clear skin on my face and through out my body. I smoked but at a minimum (I want to quit forever now) . My skin was never dry (apart from eczema spots).

Now on to my outbreak:

Day two after contact: I was in bed and could feel something was different. I had two little blisters on my shaft. Its kind of like a little hole in the skin. It didnt look anything like what I've seen online when I searched it. It didn't sting, there was no pain. But I knew something was up. I went to a clinic and doc looked at it and said he's not really seen anything like it. He googled some pics infront of me and says it doesnt look like herpes. lol. Its probably from friction.
a few days later: Im starting to get tingling sensations in my genital area. The numbness is on and off. Eventually I go to another clinic. They're still not testing me for herpes. I get all the other tests done except for herpes and ofcourse they come back negative.

two weeks after contact: The pain is CRAZY . The whole area was stinging so much. The initial spots are drying up. Btw peeing hurts, I can't fully remember the sensation, but boy it was painful. The next day I went to another clinic. This time he swabbed the spots. He told me theres not really a point in swabbing them since they are dry, but since I told him about the pain he said he will have a look and I should wait for the results. A few days later, the results came back positive for hsv2, negative for everything else.

the next week: Yet again, I go to another clinic, I show doc my positive result and he gives me aciclovir. He says to me - keep these incase of another breakout , but don't worry about taking them now, since my body will be healing up soon as it has been 3 weeks. He quotes what I have read online - ""inital breakouts can be between 2-4 weeks."" And that my body will heal up naturally. :| lol

a week after that: Yeah, so that nerve pain was less intense but wasn't going away. Peeing still stings. I had new littlespots and the old spot left a little light scar/ marking. I decided to take some aciclovir for 3 days. On the first day i had 2 400mg tablets, and one or two on the following days.

week 6: Im getting tired of going to clinics now but I'm mustering up the energy to go. I explained my story to a lady at the clinic who booked me another date for someone to have a look at me again. I done this two or three times since I kept missing appointments.

week 9: At this point. I'm still feeling pain. I still don't like peeing. I make an appointment and when I arrive its a Lady doctor. She says she wants to see. But I wanted to speak to a male. She tells me to get back on aciclovir. I tell her that I'm getting pimples on my face and I had a spot on my thigh. I do not get spots anywhere on my body. She tells me that has nothing to do with hsv2 and says to me dont stress. She asked me if I am taking any other medication. I told her sometimes I put this cream on my neck on behind my knee for eczema. She didnt say anything about this, and says ""If any new symptoms occur , you should book another appointment.""

week 10: I think at this point i had a pimple near my scrotum. My inner thigh got really dry skin to the point where its red and about to crack and would have looked exactly like the cut I saw on the girl. Cant't make this shit up. I googled how I'm feeling and I'm pretty sure I have post herpetic neuralgia. I have pain down my right leg up to my knee. Im getting really frustrated at the gym because leg day was extremely painful for the next few days. I'm getting less motivated to workout and demotivated to go to a clinic to see another doctor. I realised the eczema cream, one of them has steroids in it. And doctor google pointed out how this steroid can increase hsv2 symptoms. So I stopped using completely
currently I've had 3 400mg tablets of acivlocir for a few days and eventually got to two a day. I can vaguely see my skin on the penis is different. It's hard to tell but I can see a faint little spot (under the skin, seriously, its so small). My skin is different on my inner thigh but not so dry and red like before. I have a bit if pain in my right leg. A few random tingling sensations here and there. My sex drive is down and im pretty sure my sperm count is too. Peeing feels very different - slight stinging but not too painful.

Its been 3 months and 2 weeks. I am noticing my skin on my upper arm is dry. My legs are also dry. Ive been scratching and itching random places on my body such as my eyebrow. Ive had a random spot on my neck near the eczema. My hands were dry on one of the days too. One day i woke up with my feet really sore, like I had been walking for a week lol. The nerve pain I had was accompanied by muscle pain in my legs. Like I had done leg day in the gym. Last week i had pain in my tailbone. Ive been sleeping alot , like 12 hours a day, and this has helped with some of the nerve pain. Ive had so many symptoms come and go. The random electricity feeling in my body was annoying. Then there was the numbness before that. Ive noticed little cuts in random parts of my body. Ive got a closed bump on my face, its not active with pus or anything, but i know its from hsv2 . I dont usually get spots on my face. 
I currently have pain in my heel, not my feet. It feels like herpes has found its home in my nerves 😂.

Random theory: aciclovir tablets cause me long term (2months) nerve pain. Maybe the aciclovir cream or other creams would have been better.


Going to conclude this post by saying what i think will work for me, and what i am currently trying.

Currently using: Lysine, zinc, vitamin c, siberian ginseng, propolis, aloe vera gel

What I have just ordered: Lomaherpan Cream

What i want to order: secret society wellness website - speciifically the oil and soap.

SADBE - unfortunately not available in the uk, i would have to order from china and make my own mix. 

Thinking to use some sort of tea tree oil mix for the dryness in my skin and the random itching. Im going to start using e45. Definitely will not be using eczema steroid creams.

I am aware of anti depressants such as amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin or pregabalin for nerve pain but not sure I want to get on to this.

I will be getting a massage for “clearing” my lymph nodes. 
I will also be getting cupping done on my back very soon.

I am aware of acupuncture and chinese herbal medicine. But again, i will leave this for now and opt for cupping.

# Best Water Filters for Hard Water in 2025: Reviews & Expert Picks

Are you tired of battling stubborn scale buildup, dealing wiht dry skin and hair, or constantly scrubbing spots off your dishes? You're likely dealing with hard water. Hard water, characterized by high concentrations of minerals like calcium and magnesium, is a common problem that affects homes and businesses across the country. but don't worry, you don't have to live with the frustrating effects of hard water. In this guide, we'll explore the best water filters for hard water in 2025, helping you find the perfect solution to enjoy cleaner, softer water throughout your home.

## Understanding Hard Water and its Effects

Before diving into filtration options, it's crucial to understand what constitutes hard water and the problems it can cause. Hardness is measured in grains per gallon (GPG) or parts per million (ppm). Generally, water is considered hard at 7 GPG or 120 ppm. You can obtain a water test kit for hard water from most hardware stores or online to determine the hardness level of your water supply.

The effects of hard water are wide-ranging and can impact your home, your health, and your wallet:

   **Scale Buildup:** This is perhaps the most noticeable effect.Hard water minerals precipitate out and form scale, a crusty white deposit that accumulates in pipes, water heaters, faucets, showerheads, and appliances like dishwashers and washing machines. Scale reduces water flow,lowers appliance efficiency,and can eventually lead to costly repairs or replacements due to scale buildup in pipes.
   **Reduced Soap Efficiency:** Hard water interferes with soap's ability to lather properly, leading to dingy laundry, a sticky residue on skin and hair, and the need to use more soap and detergent. This can be especially frustrating for individuals with sensitive skin.   **Dry Skin and Hair:** The minerals in hard water can strip away natural oils, leading to dry, itchy skin and dull, lifeless hair. Many people find that switching to softened water considerably improves the condition of their skin and hair.
   **Spots and Film:** Hard water leaves unsightly spots and a cloudy film on dishes,glassware,and shower doors. This requires extra cleaning and can be a constant source of frustration. Hard water stains removal products can alleviate but not resolve hard water issues.
   **Increased Energy Bills:** Scale buildup in water heaters reduces their efficiency, forcing them to work harder and consume more energy to heat water.this translates to higher monthly energy bills.
   **Appliance Damage:** Over time, scale accumulation can damage appliances like dishwashers, washing machines, and coffee makers, shortening their lifespan and requiring more frequent repairs.## water Softeners vs. Water Filters: Understanding the Difference

It’s meaningful to distinguish between water softeners and water filters, as they address hard water differently. Water softeners, typically using a process called ion exchange, are specifically designed to remove calcium and magnesium, the minerals that cause hardness.Water filters, on the other hand, remove a broader range of contaminants, including sediment, chlorine, lead, and other impurities, but may not always address hardness effectively.

While water softeners are highly effective at reducing hardness, some individuals may prefer water softener alternatives for various reasons, such as environmental concerns related to salt discharge, dietary restrictions, or the desire to retain some minerals in the water. Other options can mitigate the effect or solve the hard water issues.## Top Water Filter Options for Hard Water in 2025

While a dedicated water softener remains the gold standard for treating hard water,several types of water filters can help mitigate its effects and improve water quality. Here's a look at some of the best options for 2025:

**1. Salt-Based Water Softeners:** traditional salt-based water softeners remain a popular and highly effective solution for removing hardness minerals. These systems use ion exchange,replacing calcium and magnesium ions with sodium ions. They require periodic replenishment of salt, which is used to regenerate the resin beads that perform the ion exchange process.

   **Pros:** Highly effective at removing hardness, proven technology, readily available.
   **Cons:** Requires salt replenishment, can increase sodium levels in water (although this is typically minimal), some environmental concerns related to salt discharge.

**2. Salt-Free Water Softeners (Water Conditioners):** These systems, also known as water conditioners or descalers, don't actually ""soften"" water in the traditional sense. Instead, they use a process called Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC) to transform the calcium and magnesium minerals into microscopic crystals that don't adhere to surfaces and form scale.

   **Pros:** no salt required, environmentally friendly, doesn't change the chemical composition of the water, minimal maintenance.
   **Cons:** Doesn't remove hardness minerals (only alters their form), may not be as effective as salt-based softeners in very hard water situations. An electronic water softener operates on similar principles to salt-free systems, using electromagnetic fields to prevent scale formation.

**3.Reverse Osmosis (RO) Systems:** RO systems use a semi-permeable membrane to filter out a wide range of contaminants, including calcium and magnesium. They are highly effective at producing purified water for drinking and cooking, but they typically treat water at a single point of use, such as a kitchen faucet. A reverse osmosis system for hard water can also remove other harmful substances.

   **Pros:** Highly effective at removing a wide range of contaminants, including hardness minerals, provides purified water for drinking and cooking.
   **Cons:** Can be relatively expensive, requires a holding tank, can waste water during the filtration process, typically only treats water at a single point of use.

**4.Whole House Hard Water Filter with Activated Carbon Filters:** these systems are installed on the main water line and filter all the water entering your home. Activated carbon filters are especially effective at removing chlorine, sediment, and other impurities that can affect water taste and odor. While they don't remove hardness minerals, they can definitely help reduce scale buildup to some extent by removing other contaminants that contribute to the problem. Look for whole house water filter cartridge for hard water.   **Pros:** Treats all water entering the home, improves water taste and odor, relatively affordable.
   **Cons:** Doesn't remove hardness minerals, requires regular filter replacements.

**5. Dual-Tank Water Softeners:** dual-tank systems provide a continuous supply of softened water, even during the regeneration cycle. One tank is always in service while the other is regenerating, ensuring uninterrupted softening.

   **Pros:** Continuous supply of softened water.
   **Cons:** More expensive than single-tank systems,requires more space.

**6. Shower Head Filters:** Shower head water filters for hard water are designed to remove chlorine,heavy metals,and other impurities from shower water. Some models also contain materials that help to reduce hardness. These filters can improve skin and hair health and reduce soap scum buildup in the shower.

   **Pros:** Easy to install,relatively inexpensive,improves skin and hair health.
   **cons:** Only treats water at the showerhead, may not significantly reduce hardness. A 20-stage shower head filter is a good example of such a filter.

**7. Faucet Water Filters:** Best faucet water filter for hard water are attached directly to your kitchen faucet and provide filtered water on demand. While they may not entirely eliminate hardness, they can reduce the concentration of minerals and improve the taste and odor of your water for drinking and cooking.

   **Pros:** Convenient, affordable, and easy to install.
   **Cons:** Doesn't soften water,limited capacity

**8. Portable Water Softeners:** For renters or those on the go, a portable water softener for hard water can offer a solution. These compact units are easily installed and are ideal for RVs, apartments, or temporary living situations.

   **pros:** Easy to transport, simple setup
   **Cons:** Limited to smaller applications.

## Choosing the Right Water Filter for Your Needs

Selecting the best water filter for hard water depends on several factors, including:

*   **Water Hardness Level:** The higher the hardness level, the more robust the filtration system you'll need. For very hard water, a salt-based water softener might potentially be the most effective solution.*   **Water Source:** Well water frequently enough contains higher levels of minerals and sediment than municipal water, requiring a more thorough filtration system.Consider water filtration system for well water hard water. The best water softeners for well water vary depending on the water source and location.
   **Water Usage:** Consider your family's water consumption to determine the appropriate size and capacity of the filtration system.
   **budget:** water filtration systems range in price from a few dollars for a faucet filter to several thousand dollars for a whole-house water softener.
   **Maintenance Requirements:** Factor in the cost and effort required for filter replacements, salt replenishment, and other maintenance tasks.
   **Environmental Concerns:** If you are concerned about the environmental impact of salt discharge, consider a salt-free water conditioner or other alternative.

## Installation and maintenance

Proper installation and maintenance are essential for ensuring the optimal performance and longevity of your water filter. Professional installation is often recommended for whole-house systems.however, DIY enthusiasts can often tackle smaller installations, such as shower head filters or faucet filters. hard water filter installation shoudl be carefully considered.

Regardless of the type of system you choose,be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for installation and maintenance. Regularly replace filters, replenish salt (if applicable), and perform any other recommended maintenance tasks to keep your system running smoothly.

1jq8l81,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1jq8l81/it_really_is_because_of_that_damn_phone/,It really is because of that damn phone,"I don't care how much I sound like a Gen X mom in this post. It IS that damn phone.

Modern teenagers spend [more than 7 hours a day](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/screen-time-for-teens) on screens. If you do the math, you'll find that [the average 18 year old will spend 93% of the free time in their life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TMPXK9tw5U) in front of a screen. Of course, pretty much no one *wants* to spend 93% of their free time on a screen, but these things are designed to be addictive. Social media companies have teams of the smartest neuroscientists in the world dedicated to keeping you addicted to YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit, and whatever else you like to include. Since our lawmakers are too incompetent to protect their citizens from these things, it's up to you to snatch back control over your time.

The effects from spending hours a day on your phone are strong and well documented. Studies have consistently shown for years that high screen time is [strongly correlated with increased anxiety, depression, loneliness, and all sorts of other issues](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10353947/). It's appalling that social media platforms can be used by *children* (or anyone else, honestly) when the implications of these platforms are known to be horrible. Social media for minors is completely unjust - it's setting up a fight between the willpower of a 15 year old, and a supercomputer designed by the smartest people on earth to keep you addicted. Who is going to win that fight? On average, for seven hours a day, the supercomputer wins.

Social media is also known for sending people down political pipelines that dump people on the extremes of both sides, and polarization is now higher than its been in decades, which makes sense when you consider your feed is specifically tailored to you. Remember the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting, and how pretty much everyone online seemed to support it? Turns out, only [17% of Americans view that event favorably](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/17/united-healthcare-ceo-killing-poll). Extrapolate this example to other political issues and you get an idea of why we're so divided and why we're so shocked when our candidates don't win or our ideas prevail in the real world.

There's a reason why [more successful people spend less time on a screen](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2022-infographic-8-18-census-web-final-release_0.pdf) \- high income earners are consistently the least affected by phones and social media. I've met only one person under 18 who has their own business, and I've also only met one person under 18 who chooses to use a burner phone instead of a smartphone. Guess what? They're the same person. Coincidence? I think NOT!

Also, I need to rant about how much people my age use their phones in public. It's genuinely sad. I take a couple classes for dual enrollment credit at a local technical college, and no one even talks to each other. Everyone's just on their phones all. The. Time. In my English class (which may have problems, but is still very fun and interesting considering it's English), half the class is openly on their phones for the entire lecture.

I've tried to talk to my classmates, but usually whenever I do, they give a one sentence response and then go back to scrolling on their phone. Like, really? This is the loneliest generation ever, so you'd think that people would welcome friendly interaction, especially since *I'm* doing the hardest move of starting the conversation, but nope. If I'm missing some key detail in these situations, feel free to tell me in the comments because I have no idea (and no, I am not ugly or dressed weird, you can rule that reason out).

""Well maybe they just don't want to talk"" Sure, people don't have to talk to me, that's fine. But then I should see this trend with older adults, and I haven't seen that. I've yet to be in a place where people over 35 behave this way.

Just please, for the love of God, put your phone away in public unless you're actively making plans or doing something important. Even if you don't talk to anyone, and even if you just sit there, it's still so much better than being in front of a screen. Try it, at least once. Start a conversation with the old man in front of you on the train. Read a book if you're bored in class. Study the bulletin for nearby events while standing in line for coffee. You'll rediscover the world beyond your screen.

""But what if I have social anxiety?"" Research suggests your phone is to blame for social anxiety in the first place. I'm not here to tell you exactly what will work for curing your social anxiety, but you know what *won't* work? Scrolling on your phone to avoid making eye contact with the person in front of you. Seriously, do *anything* else. I'd recommend a book if you still want to avoid interaction, and [reading books has a long list of benefits](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/health-benefits-of-reading).

""But I don't have energy for anything besides using my phone when I get home from school/work!"" You don't even need to have energy to do better things than scrolling TikTok. Literally sitting still and staring at a wall would be better for you than TikTok, Reddit, YouTube Shorts, or whatever you scroll on. At least a wall won't feed you misinformation. With any luck, you'll get bored of staring at the wall and be forced to do something interesting like go outside.

""You have almost 100K Reddit karma, aren't you kind of a hypocrite?"" Yes, I am. We all are. I used to waste a pathetic amount of time on this platform, and even though I cut my time down considerably, I still have a big problem with screen time. I'm as much a victim of these tech companies as you are. I just hope to shed some light on what your phone and computer are doing to you.

If just one person quits Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, or just stops using their phone because of this post, I have done my job well. And if you want to be that one person, go, do it. Stop reading and start doing.

So, picture this: I turned 24, and just a week later, I found myself in the ER, facing a massive tumor that had decided to throw a party on my left ovary. Talk about a surprise birthday gift! I was scared and couldn’t believe I was sick. I mean, I was the kid who never got sick—strong as an ox and twice as stubborn! Within four days, I was in surgery, and let’s just say my left ovary didn’t make it to the after-party.

After the surgery, I was put on an IUD, which I honestly think acted like a magician, masking my symptoms for the next two years. I gained about 70 pounds during this time. I looked in the mirror and thought, “Who is this swollen stranger staring back at me?” At 26, I was still learning about my body, convinced I was back to my old self. But then came the random pelvic and abdominal stabbing pains that felt like tiny ninjas attacking me from the inside. Naturally, I assumed everything was fine—because, of course, denial is a cozy place to hang out!

Deciding it was time to kick the IUD to the curb (and regain my life), I removed it. But surprise! I bled heavily for a whole year. I fainted a few times, turned pale—basically, I was auditioning for a role as a ghost. Every ER visit ended with the docs saying I was fine 😤

Fast forward to 27 and a half, and I was in full misery mode with a variety of random symptoms. I remember praying to God, asking for mercy and grace to make it out alive. I would take hot HOT baths to help with the pain. A few months later, the pain escalated to a level where I was literally screaming for 2 days. (Seriously, if you’re in pain, please go to the ER! They might not have the best coffee, but they can help!) I booked appointments with multiple OBGYNs until someone finally listened. It took six doctors before I found one who said she could see a cyst on my ovary and could surgically remove it. I didnt think the cyst was the cause of my pain but I hoped she would find something else. I was starting to think I was crazy. Going to the bathroom was painnnnfulll (30mins - sweating- light headed for a it to come out). My poor mother had to stand guard in case I fainted.

The surgery happened when I was almost 29….but three months post op, I was unable to drive or walk. The pain radiated everywhere, and I needed a caregiver—at this point, I was living my best couch potato life. Pain medication didn’t help, so I just prayed (I’m not telling you to pray, it just worked for me). When you’re in pain, you’ll try anything—trust me, it’s like being on an endless scavenger hunt for relief!

Eventually, I was referred to the Mayo Clinic. I turned 29, and by March, another scan (some special scan apparently not all mri can do this idk) revealed lesions around my kidneys, stomach, colon, and just about every organ. Surprise, surprise—I was told I had stage 4 endometriosis. I had to wait four long months for surgery, but thankfully, I made it. My surgeon was an experienced endometriosis expert who excised all the lesions she could find (it took about five hours, or as I like to call it, “The Great Surgery Adventure”). They used a robot and all. A few hours after waking up, I was walking around the hospital and was sent home by midnight. The next day, I cried tears of gratitude—thankful to God and the amazing doctors. I could walk without pain! 🥹 The pain from the incisions didn’t compare to the internal pain that was gone. 

Fast forward to today—eight months post-op—and I’m able to walk on my own, drive independently, and even take my own showers (a true win!). I can now walk a full mile without feeling like I’m auditioning for a role in a horror movie. I still get a little tired, but with some rest, good food, and a sprinkle of self-care, I manage my days with zero pain. Mayo placed me on birth control (norethindrone), but I decided to skip it . I’d rather know what’s happening with my body than play hide and seek with my health! Plus its all an experiment at this point so I rather do what I want this go around and if I comes back I can do it their way. Live and learn right lol 

At three months post-op, I started having mild allergic reactions to foods. A visit to an allergist revealed that endo and mast cell issues can create some allergy intolerances. When I removed the foods I tested positive for, my skin cleared up, body aches vanished, energy levels soared, and inflammation went down. Just a thought—maybe it could help you too!

Now, I’m living my easy-going life, taking it one day at a time with a positive attitude. I don’t know about you, but I am beyond grateful to God and the pain-free days. I know pain may come and go, but if this is something we have to live with, I’m going to be thankful every day I get to love on my family, see the sunrise, play with my dogs, and just enjoy the simple things in life. 

I hope my journey helps you, and I’ll be prayers for all you ladies! 😊",2,1743652120.0,endometriosis,1,1.0,False
1jq8jlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jq8jlr/home_cafe_2000/,Home Cafe [$2000],"Hi everyone, 

I want to ask some advice as I am quite stuck.

I wish to open a cafe eventually but want to get some experience through running a smaller scale home-based cafe first (i.e I plan to run it from my parent’s home).

I currently am using a DF54 and a Bambino Plus (surprise!) from the advice of this community. I would say that I am comfortable with dialing in beans and can comfortably make lattes (latte art still in the works but can produce basic patterns). I make roughly 5-6 cups of coffee a day (espresso + pour over for myself and my dad) and when friends come over, I get the extra practice in and make it from them. 

I understand that this setup would not be ideal for me to do such a business (anticipating time factors) and so I am thinking of either upgrading my setup through getting another espresso machine (+1) or selling this off and upgrading to just one espresso machine and grinder.

Some considerations I have are budget (I’m okay to upgrade more later but want to ensure demand) and dependency (I was thinking if I have two and one spoils, my operations won’t close down completely).

What would your advice be and which machine(s) should I get?

I (17f) have been in love with my very close friend (18f) for the last four years. We first met my freshman year of high school when I saw her reading Sylvia Plaths poetry and we were inseparable after that. At the time we were both in relationships and nether of us had friends out side of them so we became very close doing almost everything together. Then last January she broke up with her long term boyfriend and we really fell back on each other. I was her shoulder to cry on and we became somehow closer. During this time I had thought about telling her my feelings and coming clean. I sadly did not end up doing this being afraid of scarring her off because she had just come out of a long relationship. So we both went on with are life’s. I got a girlfriend that summer. I ended up dumping her after having my feeling for my friend come back to me. I realized that the only reason I had gotten in that relationship was because I was scared of being alone. During this time my friend became close with the guy she is now with I think. She knows I don’t like him because he is much older than her and I think there relationship is gross and predatory. Resently I have been having such strong feelings about telling her. I know absolutely everything about her like her middle name, how she likes her coffee, her preferences in both men and women. I love her and I can’t imagine a life where we aren’t with each other. How ever I also love and value this friendship we have had for the last few years. I am just so stuck and have absolutely no idea what to do.

1jq8feg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1jq8feg/the_epic_of_the_tain_farmers/,The epic of The Tain Farmers,"Originally wanted to post to r/thomastheplankengine but all the stuff there has to be in meme format, which was not going to happen here.

A few months ago I woke up and hastily typed up this note. It was a story that in my drowsiness I thought would be a bestselling book idea or something. There are a lot of details I could not remember (such as the name of the creatures at the tain farm) so the note is not as vivid and detailed as the dream. Kinda bummed I couldn't remember it all, it was lit at 3:00 AM with no coffee.

  
*The Tain Farmers*

Long ago, there was a race of creatures called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. For all they could remember, they had been farming Tains their whole existence. They didn’t know why. They didn’t have to eat, and the Tains didn’t do anything besides being eaten. All they knew was that when spring came along, there would be a new batch of dark, plump, juicy Tains. One day, a ship came to the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. It brought robots to automate the process of Tain farming. Now, the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ were not needed. The ship took the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ cative, and enslaved them. It dropped them off on different planets, to work different things. Only two remained on the ship. For 100000 years, the two \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that remained were on that ship, doing as they were told. Eventually they forgot where they were from. They forgot the sweet smell of the morning grass as the sun hit it. They forgot the Tains, and how tirelessly they worked for them. Eventually, it became evident that the ship they were on was at war with something. They didn’t know what it was, however. They just did as they were told. 



The ship was run by a creature named Stick. Stick had been born on the planet Jupiter, and had grown up poor. He was now fighting against the federation of Kepler B, who had made his life miserable. But this was no noble fight. Just like any other villain in any other alien story, he wanted only to take over the galaxy. But Stick was not a lame villain. You see, most villains say things like “I’m bad and I know it.” This makes them suck, because nobody likes a villain who knows that they are the bad guy. Stick, unlike similar villains from other stories, believed he was in the right. He believed that the galaxy was in deep trouble if Kepler B was in charge. He believed that he really cared for the people of the galaxy. In his heart, I think he truly believed he needed to take over, for the better of everyone.



After 100000 years on the ship, the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, Sam and Jack, were cleaning the air ducts one day. Quite randomly, Stick entered, asking to talk to them. “Yes Lord Stick, what do you need?” asked Sam. “I trust that you two have good cold resistance? I am going to a very cold planet to retrieve something of mine. I would like the two of you to join. I will need those many arms of yours.” Sam and Jack were honored. “Of course we will go!” they said in unison. 



This cold “planet” seemed like nothing more than an iceball to Sam and Jack. They shivered the whole way to wherever Stick was taking them. As it would turn out, somebody was waiting for them. It was one of Sam and Jack’s own kind. They were not aware there were more of them.



“Give my children back.” the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ said. They could now see that it seemed to be very old. And was holding a weapon not unlike the laser broadsword Stick carried. “You ruined my planet. The least you can do is give my children back.” After a long, hard duel, Stick scurried away, leaving Sam and Jack behind. They were stunned. Nobody had ever told them they were anyone’s children.



“Do you remember your homes?” Said the old \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.



“Our home is on Lord Stick’s ship.” said Jack. 



The old \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ sighed. “He has wiped your memories, just as I thought. You will have to go back and see it. What is left of it at least.”



Return they did. Slowly, Sam and Jack regained their memories of their home planet. It was a small planet, with one moon. Third from the star it orbited. It had these things called trees, that they had never seen on any other planet outside of a building. As they remembered, they began to anticipate returning home. They would see old friends, and see the Tains again. It would be about time to harvest them now.



When they landed at the Tain farm, Sam and Jack were appalled. Instead of green, there was only grey. They saw what remained of the storage building, and the living houses. They began to cry. Slowly, they walked out to the Tain fields. It used to be a lush, green jungle of plants. Now it was just dust. Only one Tain plant lived. It grew small, shriveled up Tains. Sam and Jack swore they would get revenge. Stick had ruined their home.

The couch was a tangle of limbs and empty pizza boxes, remnants of an all-day movie marathon that had started with the classics—*The Goonies*, *Jaws*, *Ghostbusters*It was one of those nights that felt timeless, the kind where the world outside doesn’t matter and the only thing that exists is the group of us sprawled across my living room. The couch was a tangle of limbs and empty pizza boxes, remnants of an all-day movie marathon that had started with the classics—*The Goonies*, *Jaws*, *Ghostbusters*—and drifted into whatever random horror films we could find on Netflix. Zoe was curled up in the corner of the couch, her legs tucked under her, a bowl of popcorn in her lap as she kept flicking through her phone. Theo was leaning against the armrest, focused on whatever game was playing on the TV, and Sasha—well, she was sprawled on the floor, tucked into her hoodie like she always was when she didn’t want to be bothered, her back against the wall.

The air smelled faintly of melted cheese and something vaguely sweet, probably from all the soda we’d been downing since the first movie started. Even with the window cracked open, the warm night air creeping in, the room felt a little heavy. It had been a long week. But now, this... this was perfect. No pressures, no distractions. Just us.

We were playing some strategy game. I was always a step ahead, always seeing things that others didn’t. Evan, the master of logic.

“Well, I’m gonna have to call it soon, Evan,” Theo said, his voice low, not looking away from the TV. “I have an early shift tomorrow.” Evan grinned at me, but I could tell there was a hint of exhaustion in his eyes. Theo had been the one looking out for us since high school, making sure we didn’t do anything too stupid. He had this quiet, reassuring vibe about him, like he could handle anything life threw at him.

Sasha didn't respond immediately, which was typical. She never really got involved unless she had to. She sat there, her eyes half-lidded as she scrolled through her phone, tapping at the screen with something close to disinterest. Not like Zoe, who was always on ten, constantly full of energy and bright ideas. I half-wondered if Zoe had ever known how to sit still in her life.

Then it came—a buzz.

My phone vibrated once on the coffee table, a simple, sharp jolt that pulled my attention away from the board game. I picked it up without thinking. The notification was a text message from an unknown number.

I frowned, squinting at the screen.

*“Hey Evan, we’ve got something for you. Four tickets to The Carnival of Midnight tonight only. It’s a one-time event, no ads, no promotions. It’s just for those who are meant to find it. Meet us on the outskirts of the old cornfield at the edge of town. 9 PM. Bring the crew.”*

For a moment, I just stared at it, blinking, as if my mind was trying to make sense of the words.

Sasha, as if sensing the sudden shift in energy, looked up from her phone. ""What's that?"" she asked in her usual half-bored tone, but her eyes were starting to sharpen.

""I dunno. Just some weird text."" I paused, reading it again. “The Carnival of Midnight? Ever heard of it?”

Zoe leaned forward from her corner, her eyes bright, as usual. ""A carnival? That sounds so fun! I mean, one-night-only? It's like... secretive, mysterious. It could be something magical.""

I could already feel the skepticism rising in me. *No ads? No promotions?* That alone seemed too off to ignore. I clicked the link that came with the text, the bold letters reading *The Carnival of Midnight* lighting up my phone screen.

The page loaded quickly, showcasing a dark, almost otherworldly image of a circus tent, backlit by pale, ghostly lights. Carnies, tents and stands full of trick games were strewn about. A towering Ferris wheel spun slowly in the background, though the sky behind it was pitch-black, without a single star. Beneath the tent were blurred, ethereal figures—people, I guessed—but their faces were blurred out. The page was sparse, offering only a few lines of text.

*""Step into the unknown. A place where wishes are granted, secrets are kept, and souls are tested. The Carnival of Midnight opens for one night only. Will you dare to enter?""*

I stared at the screen for a moment, a part of me already saying *don’t go*, but another part... well, I couldn’t deny that the intrigue was there. The skeptic in me was already crafting explanations for how this could all be some elaborate prank, but that gut feeling, that pulse of curiosity I tried so hard to ignore, kept pushing me.

I looked up at the others, holding the phone out in front of me. ""It’s a weird invitation. But... I don’t know. What do you guys think? Maybe it's one of those pop-up things—could be interesting.""

Zoe was already bouncing in her seat. ""I want to go! Maybe it'll be like a haunted carnival? Or like, a cool, spooky experience?"" She looked between the rest of us, her eyes wide and filled with that infectious excitement. “Please, please, please, let’s go!”

I was about to say something, to call out how insane it all seemed, but Theo’s voice interrupted me. ""It’s just one night. And if it’s a bust, we leave. Let’s try it out. If it’s a real carnival, I’m in.""

I hesitated for a moment, then exhaled sharply. *Maybe I was overthinking this*. What was the harm? It could be a prank, but it could also be something totally harmless, a chance to do something different for once. I looked back at my phone, the timestamp showing that we had just under two hours to get there.

I tapped the screen and sent the message back.

*“We’re in.”*



We packed up the games, cleaned up our mess, made our way to my car and all piled in.

The road stretched out like a ribbon of cracked asphalt, unraveling toward the horizon. Streetlights flickered above, their dim glow barely pushing back the encroaching darkness. The night felt heavier than usual. I kept one hand on the wheel, the other drumming anxiously on my thigh as Theo’s playlist hummed softly through the speakers.

Sasha sat beside me, leaning against the door with her arms crossed, her eyes scanning the passing trees as if expecting something to jump out. She hadn’t said much since we left. Typical. She always got quiet when she was thinking too hard.

Zoe was in the backseat, head tilted against the window, her eyes wide with wonder as she stared at the stars above. She was probably daydreaming again, lost in one of her imagined worlds where anything was possible. Her fingers traced absentmindedly over the condensation on the glass, sketching little spirals and stars.

“Are we even going the right way?” Theo’s voice cut through the quiet, a hint of unease creeping into his usually steady tone. He was in the backseat with Zoe, leaning forward just enough to see the dark road ahead.

“Relax, man,” I said, though I wasn’t entirely sure myself. “The GPS says we’re close.”

“Yeah, and it’s taken us halfway to the middle of nowhere,” Sasha muttered, her voice barely above a whisper.

She wasn’t wrong. We had driven far beyond the outskirts of town, past neighborhoods we knew, past the old gas station that had been abandoned for years, and now… we were skirting the edge of nowhere. Trees pressed in on either side of the narrow road, their branches arching overhead like skeletal fingers. The air grew colder, more still, as if the world itself was holding its breath.

And then we saw it.

A soft glow, barely visible through the trees, pulsing like a heartbeat. Golden lights shimmered just beyond the line of the cornfield that stretched endlessly into the night. The stalks were dry and brittle, swaying slightly despite the absence of wind.

“There,” I said, more to myself than anyone else. My foot eased off the gas as I spotted the entrance.

A towering archway rose out of the darkness, impossibly ornate for something that hadn’t existed hours ago. The sign stretched across the top in curling, vintage script:

# The Carnival of Midnight

The letters glowed softly, their gold hue flickering like candlelight. Beneath the arch, the path leading in was lined with crimson banners that fluttered lazily despite the dead air. A wooden ticket booth stood just beyond the archway.

“This is… weird, right?” Theo asked, muttering his thoughts to the rest of us.

“Definitely weird,” Sasha muttered, her jaw tight as she scanned the scene with narrowed eyes.

Zoe, however, was already halfway out of the car. “Come on, guys,” she said softly, her voice full of awe. “Look how beautiful it is…”

Beautiful. That wasn’t the word I would’ve used. But there was something about it. Something that pulled at you.

I felt it too—a subtle tug, like invisible strings guiding me forward.

“Let’s just check it out,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “We came this far.”

Reluctantly, Sasha and Theo followed as we moved toward the ticket booth. Zoe, ever the dreamer, was already a few steps ahead, her eyes wide with wonder as the lights of the carnival reflected in her pupils.

The booth looked as old as the carnival itself—worn wood, chipping paint, and a glass window smudged with fingerprints. But it wasn’t empty.

A man stood behind the counter, and *God*, was he something out of a nightmare.

His grin was the first thing I noticed—*too* wide, stretching unnaturally across his gaunt face. His teeth were jagged, uneven, and yellowed, like they’d been filed down with a rusty blade. Deep-set eyes stared out from under a wild mop of unkempt hair, his pupils so dilated they practically swallowed the irises. His skin was pale, almost waxy, with veins that bulged at his temples.

And his clothes…

A patchwork suit stitched together from mismatched fabrics. Stripes, polka dots, and diamond patterns clashed violently, the fabric fraying at the edges. His sleeves were too long, hanging past where his hands should be, and his collar was stained a sickly brownish color.

But the worst part? His arms.

The sleeves hung loose because *there was nothing inside them*. His arms ended just above the elbows, but the way he moved made it seem like they were still there, invisible and twitching as if they were itching to grab something.

“Evan,” he rasped, his voice a wheezing, singsong melody that sent ice water down my spine. “Party of four.”

My head turned. Zoe froze mid-step. Theo’s hand instinctively went to my shoulder, and Sasha… I swear I saw her hand twitch toward her pocket, like she was ready to pull a knife she didn’t even have.

“Uh… how do you know my name?” I asked, trying to sound casual, but my voice betrayed me.

The carnie let out a shrill giggle that echoed far too long, like a distorted recording. “*Ohhh…*” His grin stretched wider—*too wide*. “We’ve been *waiting* for you.”

He leaned forward, pressing what was left of his arms against the counter, his hollow sleeves dragging along the wood.

“The Carnival of Midnight never forgets an invitation,” he whispered, his voice barely above the rustling of the cornfield behind us. “And we never… turn away our guests.”

The tickets were still sitting on the counter—four of them, fanned out like a deck of cards. The gold trim shimmered faintly, almost pulsing.

“What the hell is this?” Theo muttered under his breath.

“We should go,” Sasha whispered, her voice barely audible.

But Zoe…

“Guys…” Her voice was soft, almost hypnotized. She was staring at the tickets, her fingers just inches away from them.

“Take them,” the carnie urged, his grin never faltering. “The show is about to begin.”

A sickly sweet smell wafted from the booth—candy apples and something rotten beneath it.

My hand hovered over the tickets.

“Evan…” Theo’s tone was a warning, but it was already too late.

My fingers brushed the cool surface of the tickets.

“Enjoy the show,” the carnie whispered, his voice a twisted mockery of warmth.

As I grabbed the tickets, the lights beyond the archway brightened, flaring to life like fireworks in the night sky.

The *Carnival of Midnight* didn’t feel so bad at first. Actually… it was kind of awesome.

The moment we stepped inside, the air was filled with the sweet scent of kettle corn and cotton candy, swirling together with the faint crackle of distant fireworks. The lights overhead were dazzling—neon blues and purples that pulsed with an almost hypnotic rhythm. The sounds of laughter and carnival music drifted through the air, making it impossible not to feel a little excitement.

“Okay… this is cooler than I expected,” Theo said, his arms crossed but a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.

Zoe spun around, her eyes wide with wonder. “It’s magical,” she whispered, taking in the kaleidoscope of colors. “Like something out of a dream.”

“Or a fever dream,” Sasha muttered under her breath, but I caught the way her lips quirked up as she glanced at the crowd. Even she wasn’t immune to the charm of the place.

We started with the **Ferris wheel**. It was bigger than any I’d ever seen, towering over the rest of the carnival like some ancient guardian. As we climbed higher, the cool breeze brushed against our faces, carrying the distant hum of carnival sounds below.

“Damn,” I murmured, looking down at the maze of colorful tents and attractions. “This place is huge.”

“Feels like it goes on forever,” Theo said, his voice trailing off as he scanned the horizon.

Next was the carousel—but not your typical one. The horses were carved with intricate, lifelike detail, and they moved with a fluid grace that made it feel more like riding real animals than wooden figures. Zoe giggled the whole time, her hair flowing behind her as the carousel spun faster and faster.

“Okay, that was fun,” Sasha admitted afterward, brushing a strand of hair out of her face.

We took turns at the ring toss, where Theo showed off his uncanny aim**.** He nailed the first shot with casual precision, the ring clinking perfectly around the glass bottle’s neck. The second and third followed just as easily, like he’d been doing it his whole life. “Alright, hotshot,” I muttered, but Theo just grinned and pointed to the prizes.

“Pick one,” the carnie said, his grin a little too wide.

Theo’s eyes scanned the shelves before landing on the doll—small, porcelain, dressed in a tattered red dress. Something about it stood out. Without a second thought, he handed it to Sasha with a small, almost shy smile. He shot her a wink as he did so.

Sasha raised an eyebrow but took the doll, her fingers brushing his for a moment longer than necessary. “Thanks, Theo,” she murmured, her voice quieter than usual

I got a little too competitive at the hammer strength game, trying (and failing) to ring the bell at the top. Sasha tried her luck at skeebal**l** and nearly beat the high score, while Zoe dragged us to a fortune teller’s booth, where an elderly woman with cloudy eyes muttered something about *“a journey you can’t escape.”*

“Creepy,” Theo muttered as we walked away, but none of us took it seriously.

Time blurred as we bounced from one attraction to the next—bumper cars that sparked and screeched, a mirror maze where our reflections stretched and twisted in impossible ways, and a funhouse that left us breathless from laughter.

Even Sasha, who was usually the first to point out when something was off, seemed more at ease. I caught her grinning more than once, and she wasn’t even trying to hide it.

For a while… it was perfect.

“I hate to admit it,” I said, walking alongside the group with a contented sigh, “but this is actually pretty cool.”

“See? I told you,” Zoe said, practically skipping ahead of us. “Sometimes you just gotta believe in a little magic.”

“Magic, huh?” I smirked. “Or maybe just good marketing.”

Theo chuckled, nudging me with his elbow. “Whatever it is, I’m not complaining. We needed this.”

I almost forgot about the creepy carnie at the ticket booth. I almost forgot the unease I’d felt when we first walked in. The eerie fortune teller from earlier. Almost.

But then…

As we passed a row of game stalls, I saw him. Standing by the ticket booth, watching. I thought it was just another carnival worker at first until he came more into focus.

He was tall, draped in a crimson coat with gold embroidery, his presence too still, too deliberate. A black top hat sat atop his head, casting a shadow over his face, but I could still see his grin—wide and unnatural, teeth gleaming like ivory under the flickering carnival lights. His eyes, hollow and dark, locked onto mine with an intensity that made my chest tighten.

I blinked.

He was gone.

I shook it off. Just my imagination.

“Come on,” Theo said, breaking the moment. “Let’s hit one more ride before the main show starts.”

“Yeah,” I said, forcing a grin. “One more.”

But deep down… that uneasy feeling was back. And this time, it wasn’t going away.

We left the ring toss behind, the laughter and flashing lights fading as we wandered deeper into the carnival. The air grew heavier with the scent of burnt sugar and something… wrong underneath it, like metal and decay. The noise of the crowd dimmed as we approached the massive main tent, its striped fabric swaying gently even though there was no breeze.

**“**This is where the real show happens,**”** a voice echoed from somewhere unseen, playful but laced with something that made my skin crawl.

We didn’t question it. We just kept walking.

“Alright,” Theo murmured, his voice low. “Anyone else getting a weird vibe, or is it just me?”

“Definitely not just you,” Sasha said, her eyes darting around. She was holding the doll Theo had won, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that its painted eyes were watching us.

We stood near the main stage, a massive, ornate platform at the heart of the carnival. Golden lights rimmed the velvet curtains, but their glow felt dimmer now, like they struggled to hold back the surrounding darkness. A hush fell over the crowd as the lights dimmed even further, and that’s when he stepped forward.

The Ringmaster.

Tall and impossibly thin, he moved with a fluid grace, his crimson coat sweeping behind him like a cape. His suit was crimson and gold, immaculate but somehow… wrong, as if the fabric itself was stitched from something alive. A black top hat sat atop his head, casting a shadow that seemed deeper than it should’ve been, and his face—pale as bone, with a grin stretched impossibly wide—made it impossible to tell if he was amused or starving

“Ladies and gentlemen…” his voice echoed through the carnival, smooth as silk but with an undercurrent that sent a chill down my spine. “Welcome… to a night you’ll never forget.”

His eyes gleamed, and for a moment, I swore they locked onto me. But before I could react, he gestured dramatically toward the crowd.

**“**But first—**”** his voice rang out, “—let’s give a warm welcome to our first brave contestants of the night!”

A spotlight swung around, illuminating a group standing just a few yards away.

Another group of friends.

There were five of them—two guys, three girls—about our age, maybe a little older. They looked just as confused as we were, glancing at each other with nervous smiles, like they weren’t sure if they should be excited or terrified.

“Wait…” Zoe’s voice was barely above a whisper. “They’re… like us.”

“Of course, they are!” The Ringmaster spread his arms wide, grinning as if he’d read her thoughts. “Each of you accepted our *special invitation*. But I’m afraid none of you truly understood what you stepped into tonight.”

The crowd around us murmured, but there was something… *off*. I noticed it then—the audience wasn’t real. The people cheering and clapping weren’t people at all. Their faces were blurred, distorted like bad reflections in a funhouse mirror. My stomach dropped.

“What the hell…” Theo whispered.

“Tonight,” the Ringmaster continued, pacing along the edge of the stage, “you are all bound to the carnival. None of you can leave until you’ve played the games…” His grin stretched wider. “And won.”

“What happens if they lose?” I whispered to Theo before I could stop myself.

The Ringmaster’s smile deepened. “Ah…” His eyes twinkled with something dark. “Why don’t we show you?”

The five strangers were ushered down to the main stage by carnies whose eyes were too dark. The first game was simple—a maze of mirrors where they had to find the exit before the time ran out. I watched, breathless, as they navigated the twisting glass corridors. They had five minutes. They beat the timer by less than thirty seconds.

“Not bad,” the Ringmaster purred, his tone dripping with amusement. “But that was just the warm-up.”

The second game was worse. A test of trust**.** Each of the friends had to walk a narrow plank over a pit of darkness while blindfolded. One friend was allowed to walk infront, guiding the others with her voice and hand without having to wear a blindfold herself.

The first two made it. The third wobbled but barely caught herself.

But the fourth…

A scream.

The plank gave way beneath her feet, and before any of us could react—the ground split open.

Clawed hands—black as tar and writhing with sinew—shot up, grabbing her by the ankles and dragging her down. Her screams echoed in the night as the darkness swallowed her whole.

“NO!” at his friend’s cries he tore his blindfold off, reaching for her… only to be yanked down himself by another set of grasping claws for breaking the rules.

Two gone. Just like that.

The rest of the group was frozen in horror, but the Ringmaster clapped, his grin revealing horrid teeth.

“Ah, but we’re not done yet,” he purred. **“**For the final game,**”** the Ringmaster purred, **“**we’re going to play something… classic.**”**

The crowd stirred as a massive game booth was wheeled into the center of the tent. The booth looked old—paint peeling, wood splintered, and the bright colors long faded to dull, sickly hues**.** Rows of carnival prizes lined the shelves—stuffed animals with hollow, dead eyes, glass jars filled with murky liquids, and dolls that looked almost… too lifelike.

“Step right up,” the Ringmaster announced, his voice dripping with malicious glee. “It’s time for… Knock **‘**Em Dead.**”**

Three sets of metal milk bottles stood stacked in pyramids on the booth’s worn surface. Each set was slightly different. One was painted blood-red, the other black, and the last one a sickly green.

**“**The rules are simple,**”** the Ringmaster said, twirling a brightly colored baseball in his gloved hand. **“**You get three balls each. That’s nine total. Knock down all three sets of bottles…and you’re free to go.”

**“**That’s it?**”** one of the remaining friends asked, voice shaking.

**“**That’s it.” The Ringmaster tossed the ball toward him. **“**Oh… but I forgot to mention…**”**

The three friends approached the booth, each grabbing a ball. That’s when they saw it. Faces. Two of the faces were of the friends they had just lost. Trapped inside the bottles. Their eyes were wide with silent screams, mouths contorted in agony.

**“**Miss…**”** The Ringmaster tapped his cane against the ground, and the faces twisted in torment. “…and they stay trapped forever.”

**“**We can do this,**”** one of the group whispered, trying to convince himself as much as the others. They each took aim. The first throws were too weak**.** The bottles barely budged**,** and the faces inside screamed soundlessly.

**“**Harder!**”** one cried, her eyes wild with desperation.

They threw again—harder this time.

One pyramid of bottles toppled.

They threw their final set each. One hit the second stack dead center… but only the top bottle fell.

**“**No…**”** one of them muttered, his voice trembled as the last grains of hope slipped away.

One of the girl’s  throw went wide, missing the third set entirely.

“No, no, no!” The ground beneath them rumbled. The faces behind the glass—so close to freedom— let out a final, silent scream. 

The friends screamed as the ground opened beneath them, sucking them down into the depths.

The Ringmaster clapped slowly.

“What a shame,**”** he said, “but hey… you gave it your best shot.”

The Ringmaster’s voice rang out, cutting through the thick air of the circus tent. “Step forward, my brave souls! It’s time to play the first game. Will you succeed? Or will you fail?”

I held my breath as The Ringmaster set his eyes on us...",2,1743651544.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I feel like my body is getting weaker every day even though i was able to walk miles and miles before. Now when i try to walk longer distances, I get this strange feeling like I'm going to faint. I'm not sure what's going on with me but I just want to know if anyone experienced something similar to this. Thank you. ",1,1743651434.0,mentalhealth,2,1.0,False

I also love to explore Austin and other cities, discovering hidden gems like cafes, bars, clubs, and restaurants. I’m open to having you as my plus one to festivals, raves, and even my dog’s annual vaccinations, haha.
As a cuddly person , I prefer to be a small spoon but am willing to switch occasionally. It would be great if we could work out together at the 24-hour fitness . I have a guest pass, so you won’t have to pay for an additional membership.
I’m also vers bottom for compatibility in the bedroom and would appreciate it if you have a car. While it’s not a deal breaker if you don’t have one, it would be convenient for us to have separate vehicles.

I've recently decluttered this front/ lounge room and I have absolutely no idea how to make it nice. This is my mother's place and I'm helping update and make it a nice space. I'm trying to keep all furniture pieces as they are family pieces and about 100 years old each, except for the large white cabinet, not sure where that could go or how it could fit in this room so probs will remove if I can't find it a space cause it's so large. And the couch and tv cabinet , they are recent purchases. Anyway, I'm aiming for cosy mid century plant vibes, as she has a LOT of plants and I think it could work well. General colour palette of greens, tans, creams, browns and whites. Already have a carpet for the room just haven't rolled it out yet.

Honestly need advice on everything, placement especialy, only restrictions is not sure can move the tv. 
Wanting to add
- photo wall
- floating shelves
- maybe bookshelf if it could work
- coffee table or side table for couch
Planning to
- remove giant aircon unit and have clear window into small front court yard
- potential strip the trim back to its original wood in the doors, windows, floor trim

First time posting like this so I'm probably forgetting something so feel free to point anything out! Thank you for any help and suggestions!

Travelling with sister. Doing some research - aside from 'limousine bus' service, Tokyo does not offer such a thing as complimentary shuttles?

I get it's a thing in North American - but I suppose that's part of the culture / respectful pace.

There's a wedding in Shinjuku. Think I figured out Shinjuku hotels (Below) but regarding Kyoto and Osaka what do you recommend in terms of budget to mid-range yet not cramping in style? Does each ward have their own lifestyle of activities? Probably too broad a question

Haven't finalized hotels - reserved/pay later and still looking.

Date: Aug-27 to Sept-7 (Land Aug-28 from Canada)  
\- convert currency via ATM  
\- reserve pocket wi-fi pick up  
\- JR Pass and/or IC card

  
ITINERARY:  
Tokyo > Kyoto > Osaka > Tokyo

**Aug-28 to Sept-31 > Tokyo-Shinjuku**

Hotel1: Shinjuku Washington Hotel MAIN <Limo Bus>  
OR  
Hotel2: Hotel Sunlite Shinjuku <Narita Express>

**Aug-30: Cousin Wedding <Kawadacho-Shinjuku>**

**Aug-31: Kyoto <Shinkansen>**  
Hotel1: Rihga Royal Hotel Kyoto <complimentary shuttle from Kyoto station>  
Nara Group tour

**Sept-1: Kyoto**  
'Perfect Kyoto bus tour"" <pick up at Coffee shop across from Kyoto Station>

**Sept-2: Osaka <arrive by JR Rapid Express>**

**Kyoto shinkansen to Shin-Osaka and then get to Osaka station?**

Hotel1: Rihga Royal Hotel Osaka <Shin-Osaka to Osaka station>

But this is tricky since even though complimentary shuttle, there's a Go Kart meet that's further south in the Nipponbashi ward - access to Sakaisuji Line?

However, if Go Kart isn't doable, waiting on request of baseball tickets (Nippon Professional Baseball)

Plan C? Rihga is considered ""CENTRAL OSAKA"" or ""KITA"" Clearly didn't research a lot with the area

  
**Sept-3: Universal Studios <Osaka Station to Universal City>**  
9 am to 8 pm

**Sept-4: Check out back to Tokyo**  
<new hotel>

Since I'm travelling with my sister, and we're thinking of Hakone day trip (Mt. Fuji) and Disney Sea, what East end hotel ward is suggested for convenience on a budget to mid-range? Or does it matter since there's ease of access with Yamanote Line <-> Tokyo Station <-> Keiyo Line

**Sept-5: Disney Sea**  
**Sept-6: Hakone Day Trip**

**Sept-7: Fly Out**

Part 2 - last 9 spots of my trip!,"Glad you guys have enjoyed my first share, thanks for all the suggestions for future trips! Reddit wouldn’t let me post all at once so this is the final 9 of 18 spots I hit in 4 days. What a tasty whirlwind. In order of pictures:

1) De Cabeza/El Único. Yes that’s cabeza de borrego aka a whole lamb head. Made for tasty DIY tortillas but when they made a tatemada taco from the mixed head meat, it went to another level. The chapulines aka roasted grasshoppers are the best I’ve ever had and the cow head broth was great too.

2) Coffee N Talk honey rose latte. Nothing memorable, just a downtown cafe with good seating & wifi to work out of.

3) Piacere Mio. Nice little caprese starter and affordable wine menu but the pasta was a massive letdown, especially the orecchiette. Lasagna bolognese was better but it’s nearly vegetarian with the lack of beef. Should I have just gone to Cesarina?

4) Antojitos Colombianos buñuelo and empanada. Buñuelo was my preference between the two, nice crisp. Empanada was also well constructed but the interior was a lot of mashed potato filler and little beef for flavour or texture.

5) Panchita’s Bakery. Only tried a concha, good not great but better than La Concha IMO. 

6) Por Vida. Cool roaster & cafe in Barrio Logan, this mazapan latte was a revelation. Like a quality latte meets crunchy peanut butter and it works.

7) Tacos El Gordo downtown. Adobada was really good and carried this meal. Went back for seconds and thirds. Everything else was not, chorizo - flavourless, suadero - tough, carne asada - meh with an unpleasant butane note, nopales - bad, no char and goopy.

8) Hodad’s @ Petco Park. Padres game was an amazing experience and the price + quality of the food options is not bad at all. Enjoyed these chicken strips/fries(wedges)/onion rings relative to other stadiums but wouldn’t order otherwise.

9) Mona Lisa. Awesome place in a lovely walkable area. Got the #8 deluxe, #18 spicy and the caprese with prosciutto on foccacia. None were the greatest sandwich of my life but  the components are fresh & high quality, carefully seasoned and well assembled. It really hit the spot.",25,1743650839.0,FoodSanDiego,14,1.0,False

1jq81jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jq81jq/connectionunderlying_issue_or_just_kind_of_a/,"Connection/underlying issue, or just kind of a societal weakling? Always sick, crazy sleep schedule, irregular period + cyst, trouble losing weight, Fatigue/Memory/Focus Issues, Joint/Back Pain, Depression, angioedema, Digestive issues..etc...","Hello! So..Just got done talking to a friend w some (but not all) similar issues who said that after finally getting referred to a specialist was diagnosed with chronic illness. She suggested I start here because exhaustion and inability to manage time/remember even daily meds has really been increasingly impeding my ability to work and hold a job. Have had a couple other friends suggest PCOS might explain most of this, but IDK I don't have some of the quintessential symptoms.

Mostly looking for answers on mental fog/tiredness/depression + always being sick for weeks at a time + digestive/period issues and whether it might be worth exploring anything that might explain these combined symptoms? Or do we all just suffer all the time?

Figured just laying out everything would be helpful. Sorry this is so long.

So...

* **Bio**: 25F, 5'3, 145-150 lbs, Chicana (Mexican-American descent)
   * Documented medical issues: asthma (albuterol emergency inhaler), depression (Lexapro 10 mg technically), one time a cyst on my ovary (IUD hormonal)
   * I recreationally drink  1 beer a week or less, and more than 1 beer in a sitting once every few months from Oct-May; I drink more than 2 drinks in a sitting maybe once a week or once every two weeks during the summer.
   * I do not smoke and have never smoked any substance
   * No other drug use, now or ever
* **Respiratory**: Recurring bronchitis, pneumonia as child; had a lot of trouble kicking cold/flu in HS but ""pushed through"" and it never affected school. Caught severe bronchitis that became pneumonia in 2019; diagnosed with asthma after \~8 months of coughing and wheezing; got bronchitis/pneumonia again in 2021 for about 2 months total illness time (not COVID); was sick (cold/flu/etc but always tested neg for COVID) for about 4.5 months cumulatively between mid-2022 and the end of 2023; haven't had any crazy illnesses since then but colds (coughs, mostly) still last for \~3 weeks or more whenever I get them. I no longer take a maintenance inhaler, just a rescue one.
* Reproductive family history: Mom had to take meds and skip school because she struggled with vomiting, dizziness, extreme pain with periods. Not informed of other issues. Maternal grandmother had 17 live birth children.
* **Reproductive**: Period onset age 11 (2010). Never became regular. High school (ages 14-18): I would go up to 3 months without a period, but I was so afraid of being accused of being pregnant or something terrible that I lied during every annual checkup. Very heavy--6-8 days at a time, would have to use super tampons + a pad and replace multiple times throughout the day, BUT I never faced iron deficiency issues, dizziness, nausea, etc. Just severe cramping, but I was able to manage track, swimming, and biking to school daily. Got the arm implant in 2019; removed in 2021 because I'd been spotting for about a year straight, no breaks. Was off B/C for about a year with same irregular period, skipping multiple months in a row with no accurate predictors of duration or severity; went on hormonal IUD in late 2022. Period is still occasional, but light/no blood just cramping and iron smell for a few days (sorry if that's TMI). I went to the doctor in late 2024 because I do get cramps regularly throughout the month; I got an ultrasound and they found a cyst or something on one of my ovaries, but nobody ever called me to discuss the results, I was just sent the results. So I assume it wasn't anything horrible? I moved states and transferred insurances about two weeks later so I kind of just accepted that.
* **Mental Health Family History:** Paternal grandma and father had depression and general anxiety; grandma maybe had dementia and dad had some other issues that weren't discussed w/ me but hallucinations, severe insomnia, extreme paranoia about everything etc. for about two years in HS. Got better w/ meds not sure which. Paternal grandfather, uncles, cousins all report ADHD-like symptoms but nobody has ever been diagnosed (forgetting things ranging from siblings' weddings day-of to car keys, time blindness, inability to maintain relationships or jobs because of severity of these things, difficulty with school weird sleep schedules and energy fluctuations). Maternal grandpa and mother both very spacey, trouble with school, periodic and regular ""fits"" of wanting to buy a bunch of stuff or throw away everything (and i mean everything, even beds and adult children's belongings).
* **Personal Mental health:** Depression and anxiety symptoms since HS; mostly struggle w/ feeling exhausted to the point of not wanting to be around, in addition to being unable to let go/stop rumination on sad or angering thoughts; and yeah general anxiety lol. Symptoms were maybe better or worse depending on menstrual cycle, but not so much that I was ever able to pin it down and definitively say ""This has to do with my period,"" because it's just kind of always bad or always a little better, and I've had continued pretty bad depression on and off since going on BC. Had a PCP tell me I had depression in 2021; was prescribed Lexapro in 2023. I did pretty well on it but of course not a miracle drug; I had a lot of trouble remembering to take it daily even with calendar reminders, putting the med in multiple places (car, purse, bedside, and bathroom), asking my SO to help me. In 2025 after a few months of taking it, forgetting for a few weeks and going through mood swings and not knowing why, realizing I'd been forgetting to take the Lexapro, and repeating that, I just gave up without consulting my PCP plus I lost the medication with my latest prescription anyway (don't currently have a doctor, I'm sorry, I know this is really bad). Saw a psychiatrist in 2022 after all of my friends and professors begged me to for ADHD help; she said I probably had ADHD but that ADHD isn't a diagnosis?? so she could only suggest to my PCP that I be medicated; needless to say, this request was denied and I just gave up on that also.
* **Energy**: Always tired. So tired. Mostly too tired ""mentally"" though; with enough effort, I can usually muster the energy to go on a walk, hike, or run. Sometimes just not the case. Caffeine sort of helps but it sometimes just makes me sleepy. I had a really bad caffeine habit, maybe 5 cups a day in college, and still really struggled with daily tasks although my sleep schedule was pretty terrible. I always felt like I was less tired when I just accepted the bad sleep schedule and pulled a couple of all-nighters a week, but that's insane to think back on. When I was working a 9-5, I'd sleep 8-10 hours and still be tired. Like my dad, however, I still get random bouts of ""I have so much energy! I can stay up all night!"" And I'll run a few days on 3-6 hours of sleep before going back to normal for a couple months. I now work outside as a park ranger doing manual labor, which...has been better for a more regular sleep schedule, as I'll be up and moving around outside from 7:00 AM to 4:30 PM, typically cooking a communal dinner by 5:00 PM. Even so, I find myself cycling between going to sleep at 5, 6, or 7 PM (no melatonin!) and not waking up until 6:30 AM and still being tired the whole next day, and needing melatonin to fall asleep before midnight.
* **Diet + weight** I really struggle with keeping consistent diets even when training for races because i always feel bored or antsy or usually just plain hungry when I'm not eating as much, but when I'm sick or ""trying"" I'll drop down to closer to 145. Usually even if I'm working out every day or sedentary for weeks, I hover around 148. Normally, I try to eat a serving of vegetables at 2 meals, more if it ""feels"" like my body ""wants"" more, some amt of protein every meal, and keep most but not all grains ""whole."" Veggies are usually peppers, onions, kale, salad greens. I throw in tomatoes/corn/carrots sometimes. Most of my protein is yogurt/eggs/tofu and legumes, although I eat various meats when it ""feels"" like my body ""wants"" it, not sure how to explain. I am a sucker for putting honey in tea and sweetener in coffee, and dessert, though. I'm lactose intolerant but cheese and yogurt are too useful to give up. My digestion feels best when I eat simple starches like white rice and white bread, with meat proteins like chicken, and small amounts of leafy greens and legumes. My brain feels best with more variety, and I genuinely enjoy eating veggies and tofu.
* **Exercise and strength:**  I've always been pretty average at athletics; I was never very good at swim or track and field, but I've run three \~5-6 hour marathons since 2019. I really struggle with maintaining a consistent schedule, and so will cycle between a couple of months of mostly just going on walks every couple of days, to several months of regular running, climbing, or weight lifting.  I can never seem to build up any amount of upper body strength, even when following climbing training programs or lifting daily at work.
   * Recurring knee pain since an intensive field season in 2019, particularly in left knee. Not an issue until about 5 miles running, or 8 miles backpacking in a sitting. Taping and ibuprofen help, didn't really find relief with a few months of trying to strength train but again I am terrible with keeping a schedule and would love tips. It can be pretty excruciating.
   * Back pain pretty regularly, struggle severely w/ posture, never really notice an improvement with stretching/yoga but that's probably just my lack of consistency for >6 months at a time?
   * Recently, I've been struggling w/ dizziness on harder activities like a surprisingly hard hike or trying to increase a running speed once a week (as in, this past year). That being said, I live at high elevation (>6,000 ft) and am adequately hydrated maybe 50% of the time.
* **Digestive**: 1-2x daily. Sure, occasional constipation, but usually soft/watery and urgent or just soft but normal? (idk) stools that are a real pain in the a$$ to clean up (pun intended). This used to be like 10x worse when I was on my period, but now BC its more of an even keeled always terrible occasionally good. For about a year I drank Pepto Bismol throughout the day and still had this issue. I had some kind of lab test done that year w/ a stool sample (2023?) and that said my microbiome didn't suggest IBS and it was probably just anxiety. Asked my doctor in 2024 and she said probably just IBS but colonoscopy probably unnecessary. Hemorrhoids like 2x ever but both times were from lifting heavy after running over 5 miles, which seems like a potential cause.
* **Allergies:** I had random angioedema episodes like 1x/year as a kid and semi regularly from 2019-2020 where an eye or lip or part of my face would swell up beyond use. I had to miss work at times because it made it hard to see/talk. Tracked foods and exposures, nothing consistent rang up. Saw an allergist, he said angioedema but that a test for anything more specific would be like $2,000 and treatment might not even help so I just left.  One day, it just stopped. I still randomly get full body hives without changes to my soaps/diet/environment and routinely get exercise induced full body hives (mostly from running or speed hiking) lol but what can you do ya gotta exercise. Also, I think I'm becoming allergic to avocados but not bananas (gums and lips itch when I eat).
* **Other random not sure:** Terrible teeth, always getting cavities despite having a super strict teeth care routine since childhood (mom also has terrible teeth with lots of work done, hence strictness). Struggled with foot paint a lot (high arches? flat arches? something to do with arches) as a kid and in high school.",2,1743650536.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

Choosing the right leather sofa cover requires careful consideration of several ​key features that affect ⁢both its⁢ functionality and aesthetic ‌appeal.

**Material Quality**

The quality of the​ material⁤ is paramount when selecting a leather sofa cover. High-quality materials not only ⁣offer ⁣better protection but also ensure durability and ⁣longevity. Look for covers⁢ made from genuine leather, bonded ‌leather, or high-grade faux leather. Genuine leather offers the most authentic look and feel, while ⁢bonded leather provides a more budget-friendly option with ⁢decent durability. Faux leather options, particularly those made from polyurethane (PU)​ or polyvinyl chloride (PVC), can be‌ waterproof and easy to clean, making them ideal for households with pets or children.

**Size and Fit**

A properly⁢ sized sofa cover is essential ‌for both appearance and protection. The best leather sofa covers ​are available in a‍ range of sizes to accommodate different sofa ⁤dimensions. Before ‌purchasing, accurately measure your sofaS width, depth,‌ and⁤ height, including ‌the​ armrests. Check the ⁢product specifications to ensure the cover will fit snugly without being too tight or loose. Elasticized edges⁢ or adjustable straps can further enhance ⁣the fit, ​preventing the cover from slipping or bunching.

**Water Resistance and⁤ Stain⁣ Protection**

Leather is susceptible to water damage and staining, so water-resistant and stain-resistant properties are significant advantages. ⁢Look ⁤for covers treated with a protective coating that repels liquids and prevents stains from penetrating ⁤the material. While no​ cover is entirely‍ waterproof, water-resistant options provide ‌ample protection against spills and accidents, making them easier to clean and maintain. Stain-resistant treatments ​help prevent common stains from coffee, juice, ‌or pet accidents from becoming permanent.

**Easy Installation and Maintenance**

The ease ⁣of⁤ installation and maintenance is⁢ a ⁣critical factor, especially ⁣for those ​who‌ frequently remove and re-install their sofa cover.⁣ Look ‌for​ covers⁣ that ‌are easy to​ slip on and off, with clear‌ instructions provided. Many covers‍ feature elasticized edges or adjustable straps that simplify the installation process. As for maintenance,⁤ opt for covers that are machine ‌washable‍ for added convenience. If machine washing is not recommended, choose materials that can be⁤ easily spot-cleaned with a damp cloth and mild detergent.

**Style and ⁢Aesthetics**

while functionality is‌ vital, the aesthetic appeal of the sofa cover should not⁣ be overlooked. the best⁤ leather ⁤sofa covers⁣ come in‌ a variety of styles, colors, and textures to complement your ⁤existing decor. Consider the overall design of⁣ your living room and choose a⁢ cover that enhances​ its visual appeal.⁤ Leather-look covers ​are available in various finishes, from smooth and glossy⁢ to textured and matte, allowing you⁢ to achieve the desired look. Neutral colors like beige, brown, or black⁢ are‌ versatile choices‍ that ⁢blend well ⁢with most color schemes.

I've always mentally kept track of things but I hit a point where I let things slip when life stuff happened and jumped into my credit more than I should have. Since YNAB I've dropped from 7k on credit cards to just under $700 unaccounted for that I'm anticipating I'll be able to pay off in my next pay period all while having my base expenses paid (and a few bucks set aside for coffee or unexpected expenses).

1jq7uyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/cafesing/comments/1jq7uyy/how_to_choose_a_cafesing_hand_coffee_grinder/,How to Choose a CafeSing Hand Coffee Grinder,"I'm often asked which hand grinder to use for espresso, lattes, or pour-over coffee—is it one with conical, flat, or ghost burrs? My simple answer is that none is superior, and they yield different flavor profiles.

I suspect the real question is: “I'm a coffee beginner; how can I ensure I don’t mess up a cup of coffee?"" Or, ""I'm a coffee enthusiast have a conical burr grinder, will switching to a flat burr or ghost burr yield a better flavor?” I decided to write this product manual to address these concerns.

Coffee beginners need to have a tool with a high tolerance for error; my suggestions are:

* Espresso (including Latte): I recommend the GRIZZ-63 Conical Burr Hand Grinder. It produces a tight, even coffee puck that works well with any espresso machine, easily delivering a rich, intense espresso with thick crema.
* Pour-Over Coffee: I suggest the ORCA-GO Ghost Burr Hand Grinder. Its uniform coarse powder is perfect for both the 4-6 brew method and the Hario Switch’s immersion-plus-pour technique, producing a smooth balance of acidity, sweetness, and bitterness without off-flavors.

Coffee enthusiasts with a passion for exploring coffee flavors; I recommend experimenting with all three burrs. For instance, when I brew with light-roast beans:

* Washed Process beans: I prefer the [ORCA go Flat Burr](https://cafesing.com/products/orca-go-flatburr-grinder) for a clearer floral and fruity aroma. 
* Natural Process beans: I lean towards the [GRIZZ-63 Conical Burr](https://cafesing.com/products/grizz-63-conicalburr-grinder) to amplify the fruit acidity. 
* Smooth Balance: I go with the [ORCA Go Ghost Burr](https://cafesing.com/products/orca-go-ghostburr-grinder) delivers a gentle mix of acidity, sweetness, bitterness, and aroma.

After fans cheaped out and stopped clicking his Amazon affiliate link, ghosted his “Buy Me a Coffee,” and left his channel drier than a Baptist potluck, Tim was forced to make… a donation.

Sources confirm he sold blood AND semen (in separate transactions—thank God) just to cover Two-Timing Tammy’s latest biscuit-and-Zing run at McDonald’s. That’s right, folks—he’s literally bleeding for those flaky layers and mystery meat medallions.

Got this glass top coffee and end table from my aunt who passed away last year. She had really awesome vintage mcm furniture.

The base of the coffee table had some paint scratches on it that bothered me. So did the end table and the end table seemed to be particularly faded as well.

I have no idea what I’m doing when it comes to restoration (have basically never done it) but I tried to see if I could get the scratches out and I’m thrilled with the results!

2-6 shows the before images of the coffee and end table base. Both had a long white scratch along the interior side of the base. No idea where it came from but it was like that when I got them. Carefully sanded the scratches out and then applied conditioner/wax to the base.

If you’re curious, pretty sure the coffee table has Brazilian MCM design origins and I’ve been told by enough people that it’s likely Brazilian Cherry. I thought it was likely by a Brazilian designer before people told me it was Brazilian Cherry/Jatoba without them knowing I thought it originated from Brazil, so both guesses really back each other up.",4,1743649612.0,furniturerestoration,1,0.83,False

Using this product allowed me to achieve easier super slow controlled pours  which really helped with doing blooms with low agitation  and smaller amount of water (1:2). If you're into osmotic flow, using this makes doing that technique soo much easier! you can also go as slow as droplets.

 I'm not claiming this product will make your coffee better, if anything it adds another variable! its just a neat inexpensive gadget that's fun to play around and experiment with and could be useful/helpful! I also found this prevents spout leaking which often happens with very slow pours.

  
Kettles I've tried this with : Stagg EKG (not a perfect fit but still works!) & Bonavita stove top gooseneck

Price : about $13 CAD I think I over payed (Amazon). Unsure but could be available at Daiso. I'm sure its much cheaper in Japan though.

I’m (31m) writing this down as objectively as I can. If I start talking, it never comes out right. I’d appreciate it if you could read all of it, because I need it to be heard. I need to be accountable and get help I need to grow as a person. Ella, my ex girlfriend,  (24F) is helping me write it because if you, the reader, will know everything I’ll finally be able to reflect on my past behaviour and work on being a better person. I’m writing it from my point of view to make it easier, but these are Ella’s words too.

Introduction: How we met. How we started. 

---

December 2023

—-


Ella and I met in rehab. I’m an alcoholic; she was a heavy drug user. Total opposites on paper. I’m a clean-cut, easygoing IT sales guy—charming, polished. She was a tattooed, spunky ex-raver. Loud. Electric. A proper session head back in the day. If we hadn’t met in that room, our worlds never would’ve crossed. But somehow, we did—and I’ve never been more grateful for that one-in-a-million chance.

She spotted me first in the home room. She still remembers what I was wearing: black hoodie, shorts, cap, and (in her words) my “big aul Hollywood smile.” I noticed her too. She had two tissues jammed up her nose from her last coke-fueled binge, and still, I was drawn to her. She was loud. Laughed a lot. But beneath it all, I saw the sadness in her eyes. Something real.

I was hooked from the very first conversation.

Part 1: The Breakup. Her redemption. My deception. 

-

This is several months later. May 2024.


We broke up because both of us had a foot out the door. I was closing off. Ella was becoming more erratic. She never brings up anything from before the breakup because she recognises we were both newly sober, traumatised people who had no idea what we wanted. She knows what she did was wrong—talking to a guy in America she’d known for a long time. She hid it. She knew it was emotional cheating and fully accepts that it pushed us toward our first big fallout. She went back to old habits—seeking validation, wanting to feel wanted. Dating sites. I found out through a friend and broke up with her.

She spiralled. Nearly relapsed. Made choices that would’ve led her there. She ended up at her ex’s house—someone who used to be a heavy dealer and generally a shitty person. Ironically, he was sober and was the one who urged her to make things right. That didn’t excuse what she did, but she realised that the pain of hurting me was worse than the comfort of old habits.

She went to A&E and asked for every bit of help she could get. Told her friends, her family, her adopted family. She never once asked me not to tell anyone—she let herself be held accountable. Her own mum told her, straight up, that what she did was horrible and it was on her to change. And even then, she asked everyone around her to look out for me. She told her mum directly, “Be the mum you couldn’t be to me, to him.”

I went to A&E with her—but that was it. I thought being there was enough. I thought I’d done my job.

Throughout the whole breakup, she was honest. No matter how she was feeling, she told me. She was determined to be better—for herself, and for me. She went to therapy. Did an outpatient program for two weeks, then kept going to weekly sessions, both online and in person. After the outpatient part ended, she started looking into aftercare because she knew how close she had come to relapsing. She asked only one thing: if we were going to see other people, to be honest about it. Out of respect. She told me if I wanted to date someone else or sleep with someone else, she’d back off. She repeated that over and over. Gave me so many chances to be honest.

And I lied. 

Part 2: First Relapse. Grief and Relapse. 

I was sober too, at the time. But I hid everything. We were still sleeping with each other when I started seeing Lauren. I lied to two people at once. Manipulated both. Out of fear. Fear of being alone. I prioritised my temporary comfort over how Mel would feel, even after we had promised “no more lies.” Did I work on myself? No. I tried to shag my way out of my feelings. I wasn’t honest with my therapist. Or my friends. Or Mel. Not even with myself.

We saw each other twice at her adoptive dad’s house before things really started to unravel again. She slipped into old, shitty habits. Downloaded a dating app after I told her I wasn’t romantically interested anymore. But she deleted it almost immediately and told me, because we had agreed to be honest. And still, I was annoyed. To the point where she was apologising to me—for downloading a dating app—while I was literally dating and sleeping with someone else.

Then her great-grandmother died. The one who raised her when she was young. She was heartbroken. She could have visited a few weeks before, but she skipped the chance to start therapy. She chose to work on herself instead. I read the messages I sent her during that time and I couldn’t have been less supportive, even when I was trying to be. I was on holiday with Lindsey.

When Ella landed in Romania, it was late. The funeral was the next day. She could tell just from how I was texting that I had been drinking. I was with Lindsey in a bar. I turned off my phone and kept drinking. When I woke up the next day, I didn’t even apologise.

She had stayed awake all night—grieving, anxious, worried about me—just in case I replied. She took time out of the funeral to call me and check on me. Her mum even called me, asking if I was okay, offering to bring me to Romania. They put aside their grief and prioritised me and my relapse.

Looking back at the messages, I didn’t ask her once how she was feeling. I didn’t tell her about Lindsey.

Around then, she started having hormone issues that were getting worse. Doctors didn’t have answers. Test after test. She was constantly tired, freezing cold, foggy. Each blood test came back worse. The appointment with the endocrinologist felt like it was never going to come.

Still, she went to her aftercare. She actually went to two—one full-time, one part-time. And she was honest in all of them. She told people how she hurt me. How she wanted to change. To stay sober. I couldn’t see that.

I broke things off with Lindsey on the last day  of my holiday to try again with Ella. We had a long talk about what we wanted for the future and with each other. We promised openness, honesty, transparency. We said we were going to take this relationship seriously. And for a while, it felt like we meant it.

Then she found out about Lindsey. Three weeks later. I’d deleted an entire chat with a friend. Lied about it—said I was just badmouthing Mel to her which is why I deleted it but she knew something was off. Restored the chat. Found out.

She had every right to be upset. I was defensive. Minimized everything. Blamed her. Brought up what she’d done in the past, ignoring the fact that she was actively working on herself now. That we had turned a new leaf. That we promised to be honest. I hurt her in the exact way she had begged me not to—by lying, by being with another woman. Even though we were broken up, we were still emotionally involved. Still sleeping together. All I had to do was say, “Hey, I want to date other people for a while.” But I didn’t.

The trust broke again. Even though Ella’s spirals had gotten better, the insecurity came flooding back. She lashed out. Got distant. Didn’t know if she could be with me. For 2–3 weeks, she couldn’t decide.

I buried my feelings. Thought, “I forgot about Lindsey easily, why can’t Ella?”

Then she hurt her back. An old injury turned serious. Bulged disc pressing on a nerve. She used to be very active. The gym gave her purpose. Suddenly, that was gone too.


Part 3: Bali. The holiday that broke her. 

Then came Bali. She asked me not to go—for my sobriety. For her doubts about my loyalty, especially in a holiday destination. Because of the wound I left when she found out about Lauren while I was off on another holiday. Her mum was worried too. Tried to talk to me.

I put my foot down. She tried to compromise. “What if you just go for two weeks instead of four?” Again, I said no. I casually suggested she come with me, even though I knew she couldn’t. She had just started her aftercare program and was getting drug tested twice a week.

But I thought, “I deserve this holiday after everything, don’t I?” Instead of staying, instead of prioritising her, or our relationship, or how she felt—I chose myself and “friends,” who weren’t really friends. I ignored that she was in pain. That she was exhausted. That she was still trying.

She still went to therapy. Still doing the work, even in pain. We had to go to A&E again because she could barely walk. She refused stronger meds to protect her sobriety. She was doing everything she could to get stronger.

But I went to A&E with her. Surely that was enough, right?

As soon as I got on the plane to Bali, she blocked me. She was furious and hurt. In her mind, I was choosing a situation that could easily lead to relapse—or worse, cheating—and I’d get away with it. She knew my history. I’d cheated on almost every girlfriend I’d had. I’d always tried to justify it. “It wasn’t really cheating,” or “we weren’t technically together.” But none of that mattered to her. It wasn’t about dating someone else. It was the lying. It was the fact I slept with both her and Lindsey on back-to-back days. That I could’ve exposed her to STIs. That she gave me endless chances to be honest and I still didn’t take them.

She’d been in that position—lying, spiralling—and she felt so sick about it that she went out of her way to change. Why couldn’t I?

Her progress wasn’t perfect, but it was steady. Always moving forward. Blocking me wasn’t just anger—it was fear. Fear of being hurt again. I never stayed blocked for long, usually a few hours. But she felt like extremes were the only way I’d hear her. Talking calmly didn’t work. She was trying to protect herself before I had the chance to hurt her again. But she always came back.  She fully and readily admits it wasn’t healthy but she loved me too much not to.

The whole Bali trip was a mess. Constant arguments. My friend booked a villa, and he told me another girl would be staying there for a while. Mel asked if there were any girls. I lied. Straight to her face. Made her feel paranoid, crazy. She found out eventually. She always does.

And again, she didn’t care about the girl. It was the lie. After Lindsey. After breaking her trust. After saying we’d start fresh. After seeing her sick, grieving, exhausted—I still lied.

She was alone, stuck in bed with a bulging disc, grieving her great-grandmother, dealing with a bunch of scary health issues, and I left. Again.

She started posting more revealing photos with captions like “a wasted summer.” All she wanted was to feel like I gave a shit. And all I did was prove I didn’t.

She looked for validation somewhere else. I saw messages from guys popping up, and she was entertaining them. I’m in Bali, staying true to my word that I wouldn’t be with another girl, “I couldn’t help that my friend arranged to rent out his room”. Not seeing that my lie was the problem. That’s all it took for my head to go to the worst. “She’s at someone else’s house.” I broke up with her and blocked her. Turned off my location. Went out.

What I didn’t tell her was I was taking diazepam. I drank. I hired a prostitute. I was going to sleep with her, but between the Adderall and the drink, I couldn’t get it up. She tried giving me head. Nothing worked. I sent her home.

Then I unblocked Ella.

She was upset. Rightly so. She was scared, confused, trying to figure out what was going on. And I lied. Said I was sober. Said I hadn’t cheated. I twisted it. Made it about her. Got her to apologise to me—knowing full well what I’d done.

All I saw was her reaction, not my actions that caused it. I was still taking lorazepam. Still lying.

Five days later, I relapsed again. Day drinking. I was in a haze. None of my friends stepped in or said anything. Mel posted a picture with her guy friend and I snapped. Felt disrespected. She apologised—even though she didn’t need to. She always did.

I got blackout drunk—mixed alcohol, mirtazapine, lorazepam. Ella could tell immediately just from how I texted. Later she told me she’d been throwing up from the stress of worrying about me.

She called me, got me to send my flight info so she could see when I was coming home. I woke up the next day, realised I couldn’t stay sober out there, and booked the first flight back.

When I got home, I acted like everything was fine. I lied about what happened. Asked Mel not to tell anyone because I was ashamed, but Elle convinced me to own up to my mistakes. And partially I did. But I left out too much. I didn’t think once about how that might make her feel—being asked to keep quiet about my mess.

By that point, she couldn’t even go to her aftercare programs. Her back was so bad. She was later diagnosed with an autoimmune condition. She kept going to therapy. Kept showing up. I wasn’t even honest with my therapist. Couldn’t change, even if I wanted to—and I didn’t want to. I thought showing up was enough.

Part 4. Deceiving her and calling it love.

Her birthday came around. It’s always been a tough day for her—she spent five years deep in addiction, and any birthdays she did remember were tied to abuse or disordered eating. I tried to make a nice day of it. Bought her presents. Took her clothes shopping. But halfway through, she broke down. Thought I was buying her stuff just to shut her up. She didn’t feel worthy of it. She left crying.

We fought. She admits that she went mental and was spiralling but looking back on the messages she was never mean. She was just extremely insecure and self deprecating and hurt. I called her ungrateful. She said she felt like a burden. I didn’t reassure her—I got angry. She got angry too and I used that as an excuse to drink.

She found out. She always does. And even with everything, she came straight over.

That time, I was too ashamed to tell anyone I’d relapsed again. I kept hiding it. From her. From everyone.

Then I got really sick. Had to go to A&E twice. They put me on three different antibiotics and four rounds of steroids. Gave me codeine to help with the coughing and pain. I became incredibly anxious, depressed, and withdrawn. 

Ella stayed with me. Took care of me the whole time. Never once complained.

But it didn’t stop there. Through October and November, I relapsed eight more times. Alcohol. Coke. Codeine. I even went behind everyone’s back to get a benzo prescription. And I drank with it. Said horrible, cruel things to Elle while I was on it.

One night, she just asked me to stay sober long enough for her to rest back at her place. She was exhausted. I said I would. Lied. She ended up sleeping almost two and a half days. While she was out cold, I was drinking. Secretly. She had a feeling. When I admitted it, she came over immediately.

She instantly got in a taxi and called me, begging me to go back inside. When she arrived, I was a mess. Slurring. Trying to get in my car. Didn’t even know what I was doing.

She ended up calling her mum because she couldn’t handle it anymore. Told her everything. And even then, she told me she loved me.

That was the last relapse.

The next morning, she broke down. Slapped me a few times. I had gotten drunk in the morning and taken the last benzo. Still lying to her. Her mum came over and hugged me and basically told me everything was going to be ok and that she loved me. Took us in to theirs. We stayed with her for a few days.

And even then—I still didn’t tell her about Bali. How could I. After everything. Admit to more mistakes. If I just ignore that it happened, it would go away. 

Things stayed rough. Even after promising to change, I was emotionally unavailable. When she told me how she felt—like I didn’t care—I brushed it off. I couldn’t understand what she wanted. I paid the bills, for food, supported her. That’s what love is, right? Gave her empty responses. Half-assed apologies and effort. I’d do things because she’d asked me to, not because I wanted to make things easier for her. She started lashing out again. Getting more and more erratic.

I told her she was reminding me of my dad. The way she spoke. She took it on board instantly. She just wanted to be better. For me. Again.

After Christmas and New Year’s, she crashed.

She couldn’t get out of bed. Couldn’t eat. Couldn’t shower. She cried nearly every day. She couldn’t be strong anymore. She was done with carrying everything. I did my best to support her through that. Helped where I could. She agrees—I was there for her. But even then, I was emotionally distant. Closed off.

Part 5: My epiphany. 

And then something in me finally clicked.

I started seeing it all. Everything she’d done for me. Everything she’d carried for me. Everything I took for granted. Things were amazing. It felt like the relationship just worked, we were in sync, I took her into consideration in whatever I was doing. But I still didn’t give her the truth. 

She was the one who pushed me to get my ADHD diagnosis. She was the only person who looked at me and said, “This isn’t just forgetfulness. Something’s off.” She actually cared enough to notice. To push. To help.

She got her spirals under control. What used to last a whole day now only lasted an hour or two—if that. She stayed sober. After everything I put her through, she still hasn’t relapsed. Sixteen months and counting. Not a single one.

She gave up smoking cigarettes—cold turkey—because she knew I hated the smell. She’s been off them for over a year now. Never once picked one back up.

She got herself organised—something I once mentioned in passing—and she remembered. Changed for it. Because I said it mattered to me.

Since we got back together, she hasn’t lied to me. Not once. And every time I’ve double-checked something she’s said—she was telling the truth.

She went deep into trauma work. Stuff she had buried so deep she forgot it was even there. She made herself relive some of the worst moments of her life because she knew that if she didn’t, they’d keep affecting us. She chose to confront it all, just to try and give us a better shot.

Whenever I felt insecure or angry about her past—most of it from five or more years ago—she didn’t get defensive. She didn’t shut me out. She answered every stupid, insecure question I had, over and over, with patience. She minimised and suppressed events from her past, painted it in a different, more positive light, to protect herself. But I wasn’t able to see that without her spelling it out.

When I said that sometimes the way she spoke reminded me of my father, she changed her tone. Just like that. No argument. She just adjusted, because she didn’t want to make me feel the way he did.

She researched everything she could about ADHD—whiteboards, routines, reminders, medication alarms, grocery planning, fridge labels, all of it—just to help me function better.

She gave me space to talk about anything. Never pressured me. Just gently nudged me to keep digging, keep asking why. She helped me figure out what the hell I was even feeling. No one had ever done that for me before.

She taught me how to make decisions for myself. How to stop and ask, “Is this what I want, or is this guilt, or pressure, or fear?” She taught me how to pause.

She always put me first. No matter what she was going through.

And when she made mistakes? She always owned them. Reflected on them. Apologised. Changed.

She always asked me to tell her if she did something that made me feel uncomfortable, because she wanted to grow. To learn how to love me better.

She remembered everything. Every small thing I mentioned. So every present she ever gave me was thoughtful—something I’d actually need or love. Never a throwaway gift. It always meant something.

Everything she did, she did with 100% effort. Even the food she made—she put her all into it. Just so I could have something nice. Something made with care.

She would always try to teach me and show me ways of doing certain menial tasks better. More efficiently. To make my life easier. Things as simple as “hey, shake the damp clean clothes well before hanging them out. Make sure they’re not crumpled either when you hang them on the line and put the heavy stuff on top and lighter stuff on the bottom because heat travels upward.” Small things like that. In that exact example it was because she knew I didn’t like to to iron and was telling me “hey, your way is good, but try it this way. It’s better!” No one ever taught me. Not when I was young. Not growing up. Not even in recent years.

Every time I came back from a trip, I’d come home to a clean apartment. Groceries in the fridge. She didn’t even live there.

She made an effort to remember my mum. We made a little shrine together. Wrote letters and left them there. No one else in my life had ever done that. No one else had even tried.

She organised things for me in a way that made sense for my ADHD. I never appreciated it properly—I’d mess it all up—and she’d still come back and fix it again.

For the first time. I was with somebody who gave the same effort I’d put in during the times we were intimate. She was open. Giving. Enthusiastic. She made sure it felt like connection, not just a thing we did.

She told me how to love her. Told me how to care for her. Told me how to make her feel safe. I ignored it. Or I half-assed it.

She opened up about things no one else knew. Things she’d buried. Things she was ashamed of. She let me in. And I took it badly. Made it about me. Took me six months to understand what she was even trying to tell me—and she was still patient.

She gave me three chances to tell the truth. I still didn’t.

And somehow, she still loved me.

Six weeks ago, I hadn’t fully processed that. I started to get it—but I didn’t feel it all the way through. I didn’t sit with the weight of it.

But then something shifted. I realised how much I bad-mouthed her to my friends. Told them about her spirals. Her reactions. Made her seem like this crazy, erratic woman. Made her look like the problem. Like she was unstable. When in reality? She was hurting. Reacting to everything I was doing behind her back. And even though I hadn’t done so since I got back from Bali, I only realised then how awful I was being to the one person that cared about me. The gravity of my words about the woman I love.

I started to believe she was in this for real. Even though she’d shown that she was through all my relapses. I started actually thinking about her. What she liked. What she needed. What would make her feel seen. And the change was immediate. She noticed straight away. Started thanking me constantly. But not just “thanks.” It was specific.

“Thank you for picking food I can eat (she has allergies)—it makes me feel cared for.”

“Thanks for bringing me painkillers—I didn’t even realise you’d heard me say I had a headache.”

Simple things. Things I should’ve been doing all along. For the first time, I put her needs ahead of mine. And the relationship changed overnight.

She was less anxious. She didn’t spiral. She was finally happy. For once. I saw her smile again. She didn’t look exhausted or drained or on edge. She had that spark back.

Even when she got pregnant and we decided on an abortion, she kept saying, “Thank you, Alex. Thank you for making me feel loved. For doing so much. For finally being thoughtful.”

That was all she wanted. It was so simple. Just effort and honesty. I was doing the bare minimum, and she was blossoming. That’s when I realised just how much extra she’d been doing for me, all this time and how far off I’d been in my way of showing I cared. 

But even then—even while she was going through the abortion—I found a way to ruin it.

Part 6: Fuck me, I’m an asshole.

Right in the middle of it, I decided to pick a fight. About her ex. The drug dealer. The one she went to when she almost relapsed. Even though she was 18, traumatised, addicted, and vulnerable. Even though she didn’t feel like she had a choice. I made it all about me. About how it made me feel. I couldn’t comprehend how she could like and dislike something and someone at the same time. I thought I was doing something wrong. I was, but not what I thought. While she was cramping, nauseous, bleeding out pieces of placenta—I decided that was the right time to start a fight.

And that night, she found out about the prostitute.

She had a gut feeling. Checked a place she hadn’t checked before. Found proof. And that was it. That was the final straw.

I destroyed everything. Again.

She was done. This was a new level of pain. I’d been given every opportunity to come clean. Every moment to start fresh. She had been begging me—begging me—to just be honest. And I couldn’t do it. I’d told her the worst of my actions. Yet still couldn’t admit to her I’d been drinking and using benzos.

I panicked. Got angry. Defensive. Ashamed. Guilty.  I lost it and stabbed myself in the leg four times trying to hit the artery.

She put all of her pain aside and helped me.

Even though she’d just been up all night talking me through my actions, trying to get through to me—she still cleaned me up. Stopped the bleeding. Went to the pharmacy. Disinfected everything. Stitched me back together with butterfly strips so the scars wouldn’t be too big.

And then she said something I’ll never forget.

She said, “You don’t have any empathy.”

And she was right.

She told me how she sees me. Every version of me. The teenager who lost his mum. The scared boy terrified of his father. The child that had to grow up by himself. The young adult doing anything to fit in, afraid of being alone. The grown man now. I’m still anxious, still lost regarding what I want to do, especially after my dad died. She saw me. Through everything. And she still loved me.

She cried while telling me how she’s always put herself in my shoes. Even after I hurt her. Even after all the betrayal, all the lies, all the pain—I was the one she stayed for. She kept repeating “I’m not taking into account what happened before June. We were both fucked up.” She kept apologising for when she emotionally cheated. For the times she was wrong. For the times she lashed out. But I couldn’t see it, and I couldn’t show her that I cared so fucking much about her too. I was the one she backed. I was the one she tried to build a life with. She reminded me: it wasn’t my friends who showed up. Not my grandparents. Not my family. It was her.

After we broke up. After Lindsey. After Bali. After every relapse. When I was sick and couldn’t move. When I was raw and newly sober. When I kept lying. Even then, she was there.She gave me every chance to be honest. “Please just tell me now. Cheating, relapses—anything. Just say it now.” I swore there was nothing else. For eleven days, I still held onto the lie.

And by then, it was just too late.

I fucked it up. Massively.

I hurt the only person in my 31 years of life who ever loved all of me. Not just the good bits. Not just the parts that were easy. She loved the broken pieces, too. The dark stuff. The bits even I couldn’t face. And I hurt her so badly that now—she’s just numb.

And the worst part is, even now, I still catch myself twisting things. Making her seem manipulative. Telling myself she broke up with me when I told the truth. Painting her as unstable, controlling, abusive. Anything to avoid facing what I’ve actually done.

But this isn’t about her. This is about me. Though it should be about her. It should have always been about her. 

Part 7: Who am I?

I’m a coward.
I’m a liar.
I’m a manipulator.
And I’ve been an all-round shitty person. Especially to the one person who only ever showed me love.

Honestly: I don’t think I was ready to be in a relationship. I thought I was, but I wasn’t. I didn’t want to change. I didn’t want to be vulnerable. I didn’t want to take responsibility. I didn’t want to feel uncomfortable. So I lied. I hid. I numbed myself.

And she just kept giving. She gave me her time. Her energy. Her body. Her patience. Her care. Her loyalty. Her whole self. She gave me effort. Consistency. Forgiveness. Again and again. And she fucking admits when she was and has been wrong. She talked to me about it after. She listened to me and took on board everything I said. Even now she admits with no “ifs” or “buts” or shitty explanations to shit she’s done and said in the past that have hurt me. She takes accountability and she tries to be consistently better afterwards. 

When she found out about the prostitute I literally watched the light drain from her eyes. That was a new level of betrayal. One she couldn’t come back from but she still was OPEN TO TRY PROVIDED I TOLD HER THE TRUTH. And she still helped me. Still patched me up. Still cleaned my wounds. Still told me, somehow, that she loved me.

I didn’t just hurt her feelings. I changed how she saw the world. How she saw love. I made her question whether effort and kindness and growth were even worth it.

And that’s on me.

I made her feel like nothing she did mattered. Like none of her progress counted. Like she was still “crazy” or “too much” or “paranoid” even when she was right. Even when her gut was spot on, I told her she was imagining things.

I gaslit her.

I lied, over and over, and every time I got caught, I shifted the blame. Brought up her past. Made her feel like she had no right to be upset.

Even though she’d changed. She’d healed. She had done everything she said she would. She showed up for me over and over again, even when I didn’t deserve it.

And I couldn’t even tell her the truth.

The most painful part is how easy it would’ve been to just be honest. All she ever wanted from me was the truth and some fucking effort. That’s it. Not money. Not perfection. Just honesty and a real shot at being a team.

But I kept making the same choices. Choices that hurt her. And now, she stopped hoping I’d change. There’s nothing I can say to undo that. No apology big enough. No grand gesture that’ll fix it. I’ve said sorry so many times it doesn’t mean anything anymore.

An apology without change is just manipulation and kindness without honesty is deceit. 

She gave me everything she could. And I threw it away. Over and over again. I couldn’t stop lying, even when the truth would’ve set both of us free. She told me—begged me—to be honest. To just say it. To rip the plaster off. And I still waited and let it fester for 11 fucking days. Let her sit there thinking maybe, maybe this time he’s telling the truth.

And every time I chose silence, I chipped away at the last bit of trust she had in me. I get to sit with the fact that I had something most people never find, and I fucking destroyed it.

She was everything I ever wanted. She pushed me. Made me uncomfortable in ways I needed to be. Called me out. Called me in. She fucked up and she owned up to it. When she made mistakes she’d admit them. She fucking thanked me for making her feel okay in the way she looked, in the way she dressed. That I didn’t once shame her or make her feel less than for her scars. For how she was. I realise now that this was the bare minimum. She gave me more chances than I deserved. And yet I still made her feel small. Like none of that mattered. Like her love didn’t count. But it did. She loved me in ways I didn’t even know how to receive. And all she asked for in return was the truth. Real effort. For me to care in the way she cared. To meet her halfway.

And I couldn’t do it.

Part 7: The last lie.

I still struggle with the truth—even now. Even after telling her everything I’ve done, I can’t fully accept that it is the truth. That I really did those things. Slowly, one by one, all my lies have unravelled. When she found out about the prostitute in Bali, she started combing through every detail from the past year and a half. Things surfaced I didn’t even remember doing—things I did while sober. I’d shoved it so deep, even seeing it in black and white barely convinced me it happened.
She told me to come clean to her parents. And I did—about the things she already knew. When they asked if there was anything else, if I could just tell them the rest, they said, “We can work through it.” I promised I’d told them everything.
That was a lie.
I left out that I’d slept with my ex one more time after we’d broken up. Something I denied for a year and three months—every time she asked. I’d convinced myself it didn’t happen. That it wasn’t a big deal. That because it didn’t mean anything to me, I didn’t need to admit it.

I was wrong.

I also went on dating apps way more than I remembered. Nothing came of it, and it never went further than the apps—but it was still cheating. I was still looking elsewhere. There’s no excuse for it. And still, I tried to hold back the truth. Even after her parents showed they could forgive me for the worst things I’d done to their daughter, I still couldn’t be honest. Because I didn’t think they’d find out.
And maybe they wouldn’t have. But eventually, I told Ella. I told her about the dates I went on while in Cyprus—dates with a girl whose name I don’t even remember. We kissed twice. Nothing more. But that’s not the point. I wasn’t loyal. I wasn’t honest. I was scared of being alone, and I used that fear as a license to hurt people.
I made her think she was the disloyal one. I made her feel guilty for messaging exes or downloading an app after I found her texting someone. When I had already done worse. One rule for her. A completely different rulebook for me.
And all the while, I thought I was treating her well. That I was giving her what she needed in a relationship. I don’t know how I got so deluded.
When I finally came clean about my ex and the date, it was after a year and three months of gaslighting her. Something she first suspected when she saw messages I had deleted. Something she’d asked me about over and over, and every time, I made her feel insane for even thinking it.

And still—it took me 11 days to admit it. After she’d gone through an abortion. After she’d found out about the prostitute. After everything. And even then, when she gave me yet another chance to tell the truth, to finally stop running, I couldn’t fucking do it.

So I self-destructed. Like I always do.

I stole alcohol from her apartment. I drank. I drove. I stole wine from a shop at 7:30 in the morning. I drank again. I drove until I ran out of petrol—an hour and a half from home. I was blackout drunk. No plan. No phone. Nobody to turn to. I ditched my phone in a coffee shop so no one could track me, then wandered the streets, drinking as much as I could, hoping I’d die.

That’s how little regard I had for her. For what she might be feeling. For the people looking for me. She thought I was dead. She was beside herself. I didn’t care. I just wanted to disappear.
I somehow ended up at my ex-roommate’s apartment. No idea how I got there. He called Ella. She was frantic. He got me a taxi. She opened her door and took me in. I don’t remember any of it.
That was yesterday.
Today, I owned up to everything. The lies. The manipulation. The cheating. The betrayal. It felt awful—because it wasawful. But seeing what I’d done to the only person who ever truly loved me, who stuck by me—that finally broke through the denial.
And now I’m looking into rehab. An inpatient stay. Because I finally realised: I’m a shitty fucking person. I’ve become the kind of man I promised myself I’d never be. And I hate it. I hate that this is who I’ve been. I want to change.
But it’s come at the cost of destroying someone who didn’t deserve it. A person who only ever gave—who loved me in ways I didn’t even know how to receive. A woman who bent over backwards trying to help me, love me, guide me, support me. She carried me.
And I crushed her in return.
I don’t know if she’ll ever come back from what I’ve done. I don’t know if she’ll ever be the same. But I do know this: I’ll never forgive myself for being the reason she stopped believing that love could be safe.

And she was incredible. Still is.

I just wasn’t man enough to deserve her.

I am miffed.  I spent 2.5 miserable years putting lpr into remission. I thought I was “cured”. Did it all.  Threw the kitchen sink at it.  Low acid diet, PPI, h2, bed so high it was like a damn slide.  50 different supplements.  Carnivore diet.  Cymbalta etc etc.  I praised my work on the vagus nerve to move forward to normalcy.  Even wrote a success story here.  Jokes on me. 

It’s back in rage as of Feb of this year.  Why?   Why?  Why?  

I’m 41. Male.  Healthy considering my chronic conditions.  

With all these symptoms that creep back in and are atrocious, does anyone ever feel - like fuck it all.  If I’m going to be in pain, I might as well eat and drink what the fuck I want.  

I worked so hard for a career and now I’m about to be let go because I can barely speak. A career that is lucrative and sits it the top 3 percent income wise.  Have a nice retirement set up.  Divorced because of this shit as x wife thinks I was mad/crazy.  Even tho I showed her so many posts on fb and Reddit.  Does not matter - we are still friends and co parent a 10 year old. 

If it was not for this, I’d cash out, get on disability (I have bi polar and hbv) live in a cheap studio, and just drink booze and eat whatever the fuck I want.  Get fat, who cares as I have no life.  Just trying to find cures that require so much of each day to eat shit food and walk around at night waiting for 5 hours to pass to lay down after eating some baked chicken and peas or whatever else is shit.   

I’m about an inch away from this.  Definitely doing it once daughter turns 18.  

Just ranting.  This disease sucks. 

Anyone want to join me?  More people cheaper the rent.   ESP if we move to like North Dakota or some cheap ass state.  

40s and pizza, wings, coffee, milkshakes.  

Most of us feel like shit each day and not living a life trying to tame this stupid beast.  

Just ranting as can’t believe this shit is back and have no idea when it will creep on and now just full of stress and anxiety that even if I subside the symptoms, the evil henchman will be back.  Thank god I got this shit in an oldish age.  Sorry to young people. I’d take out credit cards and travel the world eating what I want and deal with the pain.  I have yet to meet one person that has successfully tamed this long term and I’ve talked to a lot of ppl off forums.  Flat out asked ents and gis to give my email to patients with lpr. Not one soul. 

Who’s ready. Fuck the sore throats, globus, mucus, burning eyes, nose on fire, breath smells like an infant shat in my mouth, sinus headaches, loss of speech or painful to speak, throat clearing, coughing like the plague, jaw pain, tonsil stones, ear pain, breathing through quicksand, what am I missing. 

This is seriously my next step in life ….

1jq7g9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jq7g9v/always_leave_on_a_full_battery/,Always. Leave. On A FULL Battery.,"On my way to the gym, I saw two women (one of them carrying some sort of box), then I asked her if she needed help carrying the box; well, she said that she's okay and she's good. I was about to walk to their car and...same thing happened when I told one of the ladies that I was going to open the door for them. Instead of forcing it on them, I remained reserved and took the rejection for granted. (Fun fact: the same thing happened when my therapist was going to pay for both of our lattes; I told her that I got this, I was going to do the buying...she told me it's her treat, but she did pay for both of ours regardless...but she told me next time it will be my treat. Funny thing is that I was the one who initiated the whole Rosebud Coffee thing. Not her.)

I went to the gym, did 10 push-ups, 10 sit-ups, that's it, no other exercises; I left immediately because I realized my phone was going to die. I forgot to charge it while I was asleep before I even woke up and did my therapy thing. I went to shop at Whole Foods, bought as many as 30 items for a whopping $126.70 (on my EBT food stamps ALONE) plus $13.14 on my debit card. THAT'S WHOLE FOODS FOR YA. Haha, and I got three PAPER bags (again, Whole Foods...they are so pretentious and performative about their ""environmental consciousness""...they can't even sell me a PLASTIC bag even though that's the sort of thing that I like). Anyways, so I got rid of one because there was no room for carrying all the rather ""imbalance"" in my two paper bags, and both of them RIPPED. I ended up putting some things in my sweater (luckily I wore one), and I put a WHOLE bunch of other things in the other bag, which ended up being ripped TOO. I waited, walked around back and forth to grab my things, until a man in his bike had carried two bags with him. Full disclosure, I DID NOT ask or beg for a bag... anyways so he emptied one of them for me, even HE couldn't stand that WF had only paper bags to sell. Luckily he gave me one of his bags. It was still quite a struggle for me to carry all that stuff home.

I could have left ALL of my stuff in the grass for some people to take home, only to have a certain gas station or fast food employee call my mom to pick me up. But, I didn't want to. Because I had no bags. Until now. I thought eating the two sandwiches from a Whole Foods container and guzzling a full gallon of iced tea would have saved my day and my space. It didn't really.

I was waiting to see if a police car would come so I could beg an officer to pick me up and carry all my stuff. But I changed my mind and did not want them to worry about me just talking to police for no reason. I wanted to see if a taxi could come by, but outside of Vegas, apparently it is a crime for a taxi cab to stop at random places out of nowhere. I did not trust the bus to have me carry all my 20+ items with me without having at least two bags. I was about to go with Metro Micro, but it was not available. I was trying to have an Uber pick me up, but my phone died immediately after. But, this guy Sean (or Shaun?) ...man, did he save my life!!! I asked how often he bikes around here, he told me not often. I told him, next time I see him, I will return the bag to him. He told me to keep the bag. However, based on how I was raised, I am still heavily in favor of returning things in favor.

TL;DR: I taught my-very-self a lesson... ALWAYS leave the house on a full smartphone battery. NEVER leave, and especially don't shop from far away, on an empty battery.",1,1743648727.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1jq7fa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jq7fa4/new_to_bartter_syndrome_and_feeling_lost/,New to Bartter Syndrome and feeling lost,"In late October I (27F) found out I had critically low potassium (2.6 mmol/L). Went to the ER and long story short I’ve been on potassium chloride supplements ever since. After much trial and error, we landed on 80 mEq of potassium chloride and finally got me back up to normal levels of potassium in my blood (3.4 mmol/L as of  January 22nd). A few weeks later I got back RENASIGHT results and found out I have Bartter Syndrome Type 3….

And then I started to feel symptoms of low potassium return (nausea, headaches, fatigue, intense back pain/cramping, little muscle cramps in my legs and arms). I asked my PCP to test and sure enough it was back down at 3.1 mmol/L on March 14th. They increased my potassium chloride dosage to 100 mEq (50 mEq in the morning and 50 at night. Tested again on March 31st and it’s only at 3.2 mmol/L. 

Now my PCP is having me take 120 mEq/day (40 mEq, 3 times a day) and said it’s possible we may need to make it 140 mEq. Yesterday was my first day on 120 and it felt easier on my stomach than taking 50 mEq at a time but TODAY 😵‍💫😵‍💫 I feel like I am perpetually queasy now :/ it’s like a combo of nausea and hollowness that almost feels like depression or anxiety?? I know that’s a wild description but I feel so off.

I have a nephrology appointment on April 16th and then another with a doctor that specializes in genetic kidney conditions in late July. After I was scheduled for the second appointment it occurred to me that the one on the 16th might not make anything clearer or easier. 

ANYWAY, I will list my prescriptions etc below, but MY QUESTIONS ARE: 

- With Bartter Syndrome type 3, am I going to experience periodic crashes in potassium? How quickly can this happen and what can trigger it? 

- Is there a way to make this supplementation process less dreadful? I basically couldn’t tolerate the potassium IV they gave me in the ER. I have a pretty high pain tolerance in general, but it felt like my arm was being amputated with fire. 

- Is something like spironolactone next? And if so, is that something I can anticipate from the April 16th appointment?  

- Will I deplete potassium faster if I engage in rigorous exercise? 


Diagnoses: 

Bartter Syndrome 
Oral Allergy Syndrome 
ADHD 
Depression 
Anxiety


Prescriptions: 

1 Zyrtec nightly 
1 elderberry capsule nightly 
125 mg of lamotrigine nightly 

20 mg Adderall daily 
20 mg citalopram daily (30 mg in the days leading up to my period) 

and then of course 40 mEq potassium chloride, three times per day 


Other habits: 

I frequently have two little scoops of collagen powder in my smoothie. Never more than that in a single day. 

I smoke weed daily. 

I do not drink coffee. I will have tea on occasion (maybe twice a month max) and I probably have a caffeinated soda once a week. 

I’m eating at least 80 g of protein each day and im not tracking potassium but I’m trying my best (bananas, prunes, salmon, kale, brocolli, kefir, sweet potatoes, etc). 

As of right now, im not doing any rigorous exercise. When I first found out about the low potassium and started seeing a nutritionist she said that exercising with such low levels would do damage to my heart (I had stopped going to exercise classes bc of the symptoms I was having from low potassium. I didn’t know the cause, but it didn’t feel safe and she said that was the absolute right choice). Now I just feel scared to exercise at a high level.

Introduction: How we met. How we started. 

---

December 2023

—-


Ella and I met in rehab. I’m an alcoholic; she was a heavy drug user. Total opposites on paper. I’m a clean-cut, easygoing IT sales guy—charming, polished. She was a tattooed, spunky ex-raver. Loud. Electric. A proper session head back in the day. If we hadn’t met in that room, our worlds never would’ve crossed. But somehow, we did—and I’ve never been more grateful for that one-in-a-million chance.

She spotted me first in the home room. She still remembers what I was wearing: black hoodie, shorts, cap, and (in her words) my “big aul Hollywood smile.” I noticed her too. She had two tissues jammed up her nose from her last coke-fueled binge, and still, I was drawn to her. She was loud. Laughed a lot. But beneath it all, I saw the sadness in her eyes. Something real.

I was hooked from the very first conversation.

Part 1: The Breakup. Her redemption. My deception. 

-

This is several months later. May 2024.


We broke up because both of us had a foot out the door. I was closing off. Ella was becoming more erratic. She never brings up anything from before the breakup because she recognises we were both newly sober, traumatised people who had no idea what we wanted. She knows what she did was wrong—talking to a guy in America she’d known for a long time. She hid it. She knew it was emotional cheating and fully accepts that it pushed us toward our first big fallout. She went back to old habits—seeking validation, wanting to feel wanted. Dating sites. I found out through a friend and broke up with her.

She spiralled. Nearly relapsed. Made choices that would’ve led her there. She ended up at her ex’s house—someone who used to be a heavy dealer and generally a shitty person. Ironically, he was sober and was the one who urged her to make things right. That didn’t excuse what she did, but she realised that the pain of hurting me was worse than the comfort of old habits.

She went to A&E and asked for every bit of help she could get. Told her friends, her family, her adopted family. She never once asked me not to tell anyone—she let herself be held accountable. Her own mum told her, straight up, that what she did was horrible and it was on her to change. And even then, she asked everyone around her to look out for me. She told her mum directly, “Be the mum you couldn’t be to me, to him.”

I went to A&E with her—but that was it. I thought being there was enough. I thought I’d done my job.

Throughout the whole breakup, she was honest. No matter how she was feeling, she told me. She was determined to be better—for herself, and for me. She went to therapy. Did an outpatient program for two weeks, then kept going to weekly sessions, both online and in person. After the outpatient part ended, she started looking into aftercare because she knew how close she had come to relapsing. She asked only one thing: if we were going to see other people, to be honest about it. Out of respect. She told me if I wanted to date someone else or sleep with someone else, she’d back off. She repeated that over and over. Gave me so many chances to be honest.

And I lied. 

Part 2: First Relapse. Grief and Relapse. 

I was sober too, at the time. But I hid everything. We were still sleeping with each other when I started seeing Lauren. I lied to two people at once. Manipulated both. Out of fear. Fear of being alone. I prioritised my temporary comfort over how Mel would feel, even after we had promised “no more lies.” Did I work on myself? No. I tried to shag my way out of my feelings. I wasn’t honest with my therapist. Or my friends. Or Mel. Not even with myself.

We saw each other twice at her adoptive dad’s house before things really started to unravel again. She slipped into old, shitty habits. Downloaded a dating app after I told her I wasn’t romantically interested anymore. But she deleted it almost immediately and told me, because we had agreed to be honest. And still, I was annoyed. To the point where she was apologising to me—for downloading a dating app—while I was literally dating and sleeping with someone else.

Then her great-grandmother died. The one who raised her when she was young. She was heartbroken. She could have visited a few weeks before, but she skipped the chance to start therapy. She chose to work on herself instead. I read the messages I sent her during that time and I couldn’t have been less supportive, even when I was trying to be. I was on holiday with Lindsey.

When Ella landed in Romania, it was late. The funeral was the next day. She could tell just from how I was texting that I had been drinking. I was with Lindsey in a bar. I turned off my phone and kept drinking. When I woke up the next day, I didn’t even apologise.

She had stayed awake all night—grieving, anxious, worried about me—just in case I replied. She took time out of the funeral to call me and check on me. Her mum even called me, asking if I was okay, offering to bring me to Romania. They put aside their grief and prioritised me and my relapse.

Looking back at the messages, I didn’t ask her once how she was feeling. I didn’t tell her about Lindsey.

Around then, she started having hormone issues that were getting worse. Doctors didn’t have answers. Test after test. She was constantly tired, freezing cold, foggy. Each blood test came back worse. The appointment with the endocrinologist felt like it was never going to come.

Still, she went to her aftercare. She actually went to two—one full-time, one part-time. And she was honest in all of them. She told people how she hurt me. How she wanted to change. To stay sober. I couldn’t see that.

I broke things off with Lindsey on the last day  of my holiday to try again with Ella. We had a long talk about what we wanted for the future and with each other. We promised openness, honesty, transparency. We said we were going to take this relationship seriously. And for a while, it felt like we meant it.

Then she found out about Lindsey. Three weeks later. I’d deleted an entire chat with a friend. Lied about it—said I was just badmouthing Mel to her which is why I deleted it but she knew something was off. Restored the chat. Found out.

She had every right to be upset. I was defensive. Minimized everything. Blamed her. Brought up what she’d done in the past, ignoring the fact that she was actively working on herself now. That we had turned a new leaf. That we promised to be honest. I hurt her in the exact way she had begged me not to—by lying, by being with another woman. Even though we were broken up, we were still emotionally involved. Still sleeping together. All I had to do was say, “Hey, I want to date other people for a while.” But I didn’t.

The trust broke again. Even though Ella’s spirals had gotten better, the insecurity came flooding back. She lashed out. Got distant. Didn’t know if she could be with me. For 2–3 weeks, she couldn’t decide.

I buried my feelings. Thought, “I forgot about Lindsey easily, why can’t Ella?”

Then she hurt her back. An old injury turned serious. Bulged disc pressing on a nerve. She used to be very active. The gym gave her purpose. Suddenly, that was gone too.


Part 3: Bali. The holiday that broke her. 

Then came Bali. She asked me not to go—for my sobriety. For her doubts about my loyalty, especially in a holiday destination. Because of the wound I left when she found out about Lauren while I was off on another holiday. Her mum was worried too. Tried to talk to me.

I put my foot down. She tried to compromise. “What if you just go for two weeks instead of four?” Again, I said no. I casually suggested she come with me, even though I knew she couldn’t. She had just started her aftercare program and was getting drug tested twice a week.

But I thought, “I deserve this holiday after everything, don’t I?” Instead of staying, instead of prioritising her, or our relationship, or how she felt—I chose myself and “friends,” who weren’t really friends. I ignored that she was in pain. That she was exhausted. That she was still trying.

She still went to therapy. Still doing the work, even in pain. We had to go to A&E again because she could barely walk. She refused stronger meds to protect her sobriety. She was doing everything she could to get stronger.

But I went to A&E with her. Surely that was enough, right?

As soon as I got on the plane to Bali, she blocked me. She was furious and hurt. In her mind, I was choosing a situation that could easily lead to relapse—or worse, cheating—and I’d get away with it. She knew my history. I’d cheated on almost every girlfriend I’d had. I’d always tried to justify it. “It wasn’t really cheating,” or “we weren’t technically together.” But none of that mattered to her. It wasn’t about dating someone else. It was the lying. It was the fact I slept with both her and Lindsey on back-to-back days. That I could’ve exposed her to STIs. That she gave me endless chances to be honest and I still didn’t take them.

She’d been in that position—lying, spiralling—and she felt so sick about it that she went out of her way to change. Why couldn’t I?

Her progress wasn’t perfect, but it was steady. Always moving forward. Blocking me wasn’t just anger—it was fear. Fear of being hurt again. I never stayed blocked for long, usually a few hours. But she felt like extremes were the only way I’d hear her. Talking calmly didn’t work. She was trying to protect herself before I had the chance to hurt her again. But she always came back.  She fully and readily admits it wasn’t healthy but she loved me too much not to.

The whole Bali trip was a mess. Constant arguments. My friend booked a villa, and he told me another girl would be staying there for a while. Mel asked if there were any girls. I lied. Straight to her face. Made her feel paranoid, crazy. She found out eventually. She always does.

And again, she didn’t care about the girl. It was the lie. After Lindsey. After breaking her trust. After saying we’d start fresh. After seeing her sick, grieving, exhausted—I still lied.

She was alone, stuck in bed with a bulging disc, grieving her great-grandmother, dealing with a bunch of scary health issues, and I left. Again.

She started posting more revealing photos with captions like “a wasted summer.” All she wanted was to feel like I gave a shit. And all I did was prove I didn’t.

She looked for validation somewhere else. I saw messages from guys popping up, and she was entertaining them. I’m in Bali, staying true to my word that I wouldn’t be with another girl, “I couldn’t help that my friend arranged to rent out his room”. Not seeing that my lie was the problem. That’s all it took for my head to go to the worst. “She’s at someone else’s house.” I broke up with her and blocked her. Turned off my location. Went out.

What I didn’t tell her was I was taking diazepam. I drank. I hired a prostitute. I was going to sleep with her, but between the Adderall and the drink, I couldn’t get it up. She tried giving me head. Nothing worked. I sent her home.

Then I unblocked Ella.

She was upset. Rightly so. She was scared, confused, trying to figure out what was going on. And I lied. Said I was sober. Said I hadn’t cheated. I twisted it. Made it about her. Got her to apologise to me—knowing full well what I’d done.

All I saw was her reaction, not my actions that caused it. I was still taking lorazepam. Still lying.

Five days later, I relapsed again. Day drinking. I was in a haze. None of my friends stepped in or said anything. Mel posted a picture with her guy friend and I snapped. Felt disrespected. She apologised—even though she didn’t need to. She always did.

I got blackout drunk—mixed alcohol, mirtazapine, lorazepam. Ella could tell immediately just from how I texted. Later she told me she’d been throwing up from the stress of worrying about me.

She called me, got me to send my flight info so she could see when I was coming home. I woke up the next day, realised I couldn’t stay sober out there, and booked the first flight back.

When I got home, I acted like everything was fine. I lied about what happened. Asked Mel not to tell anyone because I was ashamed, but Elle convinced me to own up to my mistakes. And partially I did. But I left out too much. I didn’t think once about how that might make her feel—being asked to keep quiet about my mess.

By that point, she couldn’t even go to her aftercare programs. Her back was so bad. She was later diagnosed with an autoimmune condition. She kept going to therapy. Kept showing up. I wasn’t even honest with my therapist. Couldn’t change, even if I wanted to—and I didn’t want to. I thought showing up was enough.

Part 4. Deceiving her and calling it love.

Her birthday came around. It’s always been a tough day for her—she spent five years deep in addiction, and any birthdays she did remember were tied to abuse or disordered eating. I tried to make a nice day of it. Bought her presents. Took her clothes shopping. But halfway through, she broke down. Thought I was buying her stuff just to shut her up. She didn’t feel worthy of it. She left crying.

We fought. She admits that she went mental and was spiralling but looking back on the messages she was never mean. She was just extremely insecure and self deprecating and hurt. I called her ungrateful. She said she felt like a burden. I didn’t reassure her—I got angry. She got angry too and I used that as an excuse to drink.

She found out. She always does. And even with everything, she came straight over.

That time, I was too ashamed to tell anyone I’d relapsed again. I kept hiding it. From her. From everyone.

Then I got really sick. Had to go to A&E twice. They put me on three different antibiotics and four rounds of steroids. Gave me codeine to help with the coughing and pain. I became incredibly anxious, depressed, and withdrawn. 

Ella stayed with me. Took care of me the whole time. Never once complained.

But it didn’t stop there. Through October and November, I relapsed eight more times. Alcohol. Coke. Codeine. I even went behind everyone’s back to get a benzo prescription. And I drank with it. Said horrible, cruel things to Elle while I was on it.

One night, she just asked me to stay sober long enough for her to rest back at her place. She was exhausted. I said I would. Lied. She ended up sleeping almost two and a half days. While she was out cold, I was drinking. Secretly. She had a feeling. When I admitted it, she came over immediately.

She instantly got in a taxi and called me, begging me to go back inside. When she arrived, I was a mess. Slurring. Trying to get in my car. Didn’t even know what I was doing.

She ended up calling her mum because she couldn’t handle it anymore. Told her everything. And even then, she told me she loved me.

That was the last relapse.

The next morning, she broke down. Slapped me a few times. I had gotten drunk in the morning and taken the last benzo. Still lying to her. Her mum came over and hugged me and basically told me everything was going to be ok and that she loved me. Took us in to theirs. We stayed with her for a few days.

And even then—I still didn’t tell her about Bali. How could I. After everything. Admit to more mistakes. If I just ignore that it happened, it would go away. 

Things stayed rough. Even after promising to change, I was emotionally unavailable. When she told me how she felt—like I didn’t care—I brushed it off. I couldn’t understand what she wanted. I paid the bills, for food, supported her. That’s what love is, right? Gave her empty responses. Half-assed apologies and effort. I’d do things because she’d asked me to, not because I wanted to make things easier for her. She started lashing out again. Getting more and more erratic.

I told her she was reminding me of my dad. The way she spoke. She took it on board instantly. She just wanted to be better. For me. Again.

After Christmas and New Year’s, she crashed.

She couldn’t get out of bed. Couldn’t eat. Couldn’t shower. She cried nearly every day. She couldn’t be strong anymore. She was done with carrying everything. I did my best to support her through that. Helped where I could. She agrees—I was there for her. But even then, I was emotionally distant. Closed off.

Part 5: My epiphany. 

And then something in me finally clicked.

I started seeing it all. Everything she’d done for me. Everything she’d carried for me. Everything I took for granted. Things were amazing. It felt like the relationship just worked, we were in sync, I took her into consideration in whatever I was doing. But I still didn’t give her the truth. 

She was the one who pushed me to get my ADHD diagnosis. She was the only person who looked at me and said, “This isn’t just forgetfulness. Something’s off.” She actually cared enough to notice. To push. To help.

She got her spirals under control. What used to last a whole day now only lasted an hour or two—if that. She stayed sober. After everything I put her through, she still hasn’t relapsed. Sixteen months and counting. Not a single one.

She gave up smoking cigarettes—cold turkey—because she knew I hated the smell. She’s been off them for over a year now. Never once picked one back up.

She got herself organised—something I once mentioned in passing—and she remembered. Changed for it. Because I said it mattered to me.

Since we got back together, she hasn’t lied to me. Not once. And every time I’ve double-checked something she’s said—she was telling the truth.

She went deep into trauma work. Stuff she had buried so deep she forgot it was even there. She made herself relive some of the worst moments of her life because she knew that if she didn’t, they’d keep affecting us. She chose to confront it all, just to try and give us a better shot.

Whenever I felt insecure or angry about her past—most of it from five or more years ago—she didn’t get defensive. She didn’t shut me out. She answered every stupid, insecure question I had, over and over, with patience. She minimised and suppressed events from her past, painted it in a different, more positive light, to protect herself. But I wasn’t able to see that without her spelling it out.

When I said that sometimes the way she spoke reminded me of my father, she changed her tone. Just like that. No argument. She just adjusted, because she didn’t want to make me feel the way he did.

She researched everything she could about ADHD—whiteboards, routines, reminders, medication alarms, grocery planning, fridge labels, all of it—just to help me function better.

She gave me space to talk about anything. Never pressured me. Just gently nudged me to keep digging, keep asking why. She helped me figure out what the hell I was even feeling. No one had ever done that for me before.

She taught me how to make decisions for myself. How to stop and ask, “Is this what I want, or is this guilt, or pressure, or fear?” She taught me how to pause.

She always put me first. No matter what she was going through.

And when she made mistakes? She always owned them. Reflected on them. Apologised. Changed.

She always asked me to tell her if she did something that made me feel uncomfortable, because she wanted to grow. To learn how to love me better.

She remembered everything. Every small thing I mentioned. So every present she ever gave me was thoughtful—something I’d actually need or love. Never a throwaway gift. It always meant something.

Everything she did, she did with 100% effort. Even the food she made—she put her all into it. Just so I could have something nice. Something made with care.

She would always try to teach me and show me ways of doing certain menial tasks better. More efficiently. To make my life easier. Things as simple as “hey, shake the damp clean clothes well before hanging them out. Make sure they’re not crumpled either when you hang them on the line and put the heavy stuff on top and lighter stuff on the bottom because heat travels upward.” Small things like that. In that exact example it was because she knew I didn’t like to to iron and was telling me “hey, your way is good, but try it this way. It’s better!” No one ever taught me. Not when I was young. Not growing up. Not even in recent years.

Every time I came back from a trip, I’d come home to a clean apartment. Groceries in the fridge. She didn’t even live there.

She made an effort to remember my mum. We made a little shrine together. Wrote letters and left them there. No one else in my life had ever done that. No one else had even tried.

She organised things for me in a way that made sense for my ADHD. I never appreciated it properly—I’d mess it all up—and she’d still come back and fix it again.

For the first time. I was with somebody who gave the same effort I’d put in during the times we were intimate. She was open. Giving. Enthusiastic. She made sure it felt like connection, not just a thing we did.

She told me how to love her. Told me how to care for her. Told me how to make her feel safe. I ignored it. Or I half-assed it.

She opened up about things no one else knew. Things she’d buried. Things she was ashamed of. She let me in. And I took it badly. Made it about me. Took me six months to understand what she was even trying to tell me—and she was still patient.

She gave me three chances to tell the truth. I still didn’t.

And somehow, she still loved me.

Six weeks ago, I hadn’t fully processed that. I started to get it—but I didn’t feel it all the way through. I didn’t sit with the weight of it.

But then something shifted. I realised how much I bad-mouthed her to my friends. Told them about her spirals. Her reactions. Made her seem like this crazy, erratic woman. Made her look like the problem. Like she was unstable. When in reality? She was hurting. Reacting to everything I was doing behind her back. And even though I hadn’t done so since I got back from Bali, I only realised then how awful I was being to the one person that cared about me. The gravity of my words about the woman I love.

I started to believe she was in this for real. Even though she’d shown that she was through all my relapses. I started actually thinking about her. What she liked. What she needed. What would make her feel seen. And the change was immediate. She noticed straight away. Started thanking me constantly. But not just “thanks.” It was specific.

“Thank you for picking food I can eat (she has allergies)—it makes me feel cared for.”

“Thanks for bringing me painkillers—I didn’t even realise you’d heard me say I had a headache.”

Simple things. Things I should’ve been doing all along. For the first time, I put her needs ahead of mine. And the relationship changed overnight.

She was less anxious. She didn’t spiral. She was finally happy. For once. I saw her smile again. She didn’t look exhausted or drained or on edge. She had that spark back.

Even when she got pregnant and we decided on an abortion, she kept saying, “Thank you, Alex. Thank you for making me feel loved. For doing so much. For finally being thoughtful.”

That was all she wanted. It was so simple. Just effort and honesty. I was doing the bare minimum, and she was blossoming. That’s when I realised just how much extra she’d been doing for me, all this time and how far off I’d been in my way of showing I cared. 

But even then—even while she was going through the abortion—I found a way to ruin it.

Part 6: Fuck me, I’m an asshole.

Right in the middle of it, I decided to pick a fight. About her ex. The drug dealer. The one she went to when she almost relapsed. Even though she was 18, traumatised, addicted, and vulnerable. Even though she didn’t feel like she had a choice. I made it all about me. About how it made me feel. I couldn’t comprehend how she could like and dislike something and someone at the same time. I thought I was doing something wrong. I was, but not what I thought. While she was cramping, nauseous, bleeding out pieces of placenta—I decided that was the right time to start a fight.

And that night, she found out about the prostitute.

She had a gut feeling. Checked a place she hadn’t checked before. Found proof. And that was it. That was the final straw.

I destroyed everything. Again.

She was done. This was a new level of pain. I’d been given every opportunity to come clean. Every moment to start fresh. She had been begging me—begging me—to just be honest. And I couldn’t do it. I’d told her the worst of my actions. Yet still couldn’t admit to her I’d been drinking and using benzos.

I panicked. Got angry. Defensive. Ashamed. Guilty.  I lost it and stabbed myself in the leg four times trying to hit the artery.

She put all of her pain aside and helped me.

Even though she’d just been up all night talking me through my actions, trying to get through to me—she still cleaned me up. Stopped the bleeding. Went to the pharmacy. Disinfected everything. Stitched me back together with butterfly strips so the scars wouldn’t be too big.

And then she said something I’ll never forget.

She said, “You don’t have any empathy.”

And she was right.

She told me how she sees me. Every version of me. The teenager who lost his mum. The scared boy terrified of his father. The child that had to grow up by himself. The young adult doing anything to fit in, afraid of being alone. The grown man now. I’m still anxious, still lost regarding what I want to do, especially after my dad died. She saw me. Through everything. And she still loved me.

She cried while telling me how she’s always put herself in my shoes. Even after I hurt her. Even after all the betrayal, all the lies, all the pain—I was the one she stayed for. She kept repeating “I’m not taking into account what happened before June. We were both fucked up.” She kept apologising for when she emotionally cheated. For the times she was wrong. For the times she lashed out. But I couldn’t see it, and I couldn’t show her that I cared so fucking much about her too. I was the one she backed. I was the one she tried to build a life with. She reminded me: it wasn’t my friends who showed up. Not my grandparents. Not my family. It was her.

After we broke up. After Lindsey. After Bali. After every relapse. When I was sick and couldn’t move. When I was raw and newly sober. When I kept lying. Even then, she was there.She gave me every chance to be honest. “Please just tell me now. Cheating, relapses—anything. Just say it now.” I swore there was nothing else. For eleven days, I still held onto the lie.

And by then, it was just too late.

I fucked it up. Massively.

I hurt the only person in my 31 years of life who ever loved all of me. Not just the good bits. Not just the parts that were easy. She loved the broken pieces, too. The dark stuff. The bits even I couldn’t face. And I hurt her so badly that now—she’s just numb.

And the worst part is, even now, I still catch myself twisting things. Making her seem manipulative. Telling myself she broke up with me when I told the truth. Painting her as unstable, controlling, abusive. Anything to avoid facing what I’ve actually done.

But this isn’t about her. This is about me. Though it should be about her. It should have always been about her. 

Part 7: Who am I?

I’m a coward.
I’m a liar.
I’m a manipulator.
And I’ve been an all-round shitty person. Especially to the one person who only ever showed me love.

Honestly: I don’t think I was ready to be in a relationship. I thought I was, but I wasn’t. I didn’t want to change. I didn’t want to be vulnerable. I didn’t want to take responsibility. I didn’t want to feel uncomfortable. So I lied. I hid. I numbed myself.

And she just kept giving. She gave me her time. Her energy. Her body. Her patience. Her care. Her loyalty. Her whole self. She gave me effort. Consistency. Forgiveness. Again and again. And she fucking admits when she was and has been wrong. She talked to me about it after. She listened to me and took on board everything I said. Even now she admits with no “ifs” or “buts” or shitty explanations to shit she’s done and said in the past that have hurt me. She takes accountability and she tries to be consistently better afterwards. 

When she found out about the prostitute I literally watched the light drain from her eyes. That was a new level of betrayal. One she couldn’t come back from but she still was OPEN TO TRY PROVIDED I TOLD HER THE TRUTH. And she still helped me. Still patched me up. Still cleaned my wounds. Still told me, somehow, that she loved me.

I didn’t just hurt her feelings. I changed how she saw the world. How she saw love. I made her question whether effort and kindness and growth were even worth it.

And that’s on me.

I made her feel like nothing she did mattered. Like none of her progress counted. Like she was still “crazy” or “too much” or “paranoid” even when she was right. Even when her gut was spot on, I told her she was imagining things.

I gaslit her.

I lied, over and over, and every time I got caught, I shifted the blame. Brought up her past. Made her feel like she had no right to be upset.

Even though she’d changed. She’d healed. She had done everything she said she would. She showed up for me over and over again, even when I didn’t deserve it.

And I couldn’t even tell her the truth.

The most painful part is how easy it would’ve been to just be honest. All she ever wanted from me was the truth and some fucking effort. That’s it. Not money. Not perfection. Just honesty and a real shot at being a team.

But I kept making the same choices. Choices that hurt her. And now, she stopped hoping I’d change. There’s nothing I can say to undo that. No apology big enough. No grand gesture that’ll fix it. I’ve said sorry so many times it doesn’t mean anything anymore.

An apology without change is just manipulation and kindness without honesty is deceit. 

She gave me everything she could. And I threw it away. Over and over again. I couldn’t stop lying, even when the truth would’ve set both of us free. She told me—begged me—to be honest. To just say it. To rip the plaster off. And I still waited and let it fester for 11 fucking days. Let her sit there thinking maybe, maybe this time he’s telling the truth.

And every time I chose silence, I chipped away at the last bit of trust she had in me. I get to sit with the fact that I had something most people never find, and I fucking destroyed it.

She was everything I ever wanted. She pushed me. Made me uncomfortable in ways I needed to be. Called me out. Called me in. She fucked up and she owned up to it. When she made mistakes she’d admit them. She fucking thanked me for making her feel okay in the way she looked, in the way she dressed. That I didn’t once shame her or make her feel less than for her scars. For how she was. I realise now that this was the bare minimum. She gave me more chances than I deserved. And yet I still made her feel small. Like none of that mattered. Like her love didn’t count. But it did. She loved me in ways I didn’t even know how to receive. And all she asked for in return was the truth. Real effort. For me to care in the way she cared. To meet her halfway.

And I couldn’t do it.

Part 7: The last lie.

I still struggle with the truth—even now. Even after telling her everything I’ve done, I can’t fully accept that it is the truth. That I really did those things. Slowly, one by one, all my lies have unravelled. When she found out about the prostitute in Bali, she started combing through every detail from the past year and a half. Things surfaced I didn’t even remember doing—things I did while sober. I’d shoved it so deep, even seeing it in black and white barely convinced me it happened.
She told me to come clean to her parents. And I did—about the things she already knew. When they asked if there was anything else, if I could just tell them the rest, they said, “We can work through it.” I promised I’d told them everything.
That was a lie.
I left out that I’d slept with my ex one more time after we’d broken up. Something I denied for a year and three months—every time she asked. I’d convinced myself it didn’t happen. That it wasn’t a big deal. That because it didn’t mean anything to me, I didn’t need to admit it.

I was wrong.

I also went on dating apps way more than I remembered. Nothing came of it, and it never went further than the apps—but it was still cheating. I was still looking elsewhere. There’s no excuse for it. And still, I tried to hold back the truth. Even after her parents showed they could forgive me for the worst things I’d done to their daughter, I still couldn’t be honest. Because I didn’t think they’d find out.
And maybe they wouldn’t have. But eventually, I told Ella. I told her about the dates I went on while in Cyprus—dates with a girl whose name I don’t even remember. We kissed twice. Nothing more. But that’s not the point. I wasn’t loyal. I wasn’t honest. I was scared of being alone, and I used that fear as a license to hurt people.
I made her think she was the disloyal one. I made her feel guilty for messaging exes or downloading an app after I found her texting someone. When I had already done worse. One rule for her. A completely different rulebook for me.
And all the while, I thought I was treating her well. That I was giving her what she needed in a relationship. I don’t know how I got so deluded.
When I finally came clean about my ex and the date, it was after a year and three months of gaslighting her. Something she first suspected when she saw messages I had deleted. Something she’d asked me about over and over, and every time, I made her feel insane for even thinking it.

And still—it took me 11 days to admit it. After she’d gone through an abortion. After she’d found out about the prostitute. After everything. And even then, when she gave me yet another chance to tell the truth, to finally stop running, I couldn’t fucking do it.

So I self-destructed. Like I always do.

I stole alcohol from her apartment. I drank. I drove. I stole wine from a shop at 7:30 in the morning. I drank again. I drove until I ran out of petrol—an hour and a half from home. I was blackout drunk. No plan. No phone. Nobody to turn to. I ditched my phone in a coffee shop so no one could track me, then wandered the streets, drinking as much as I could, hoping I’d die.

That’s how little regard I had for her. For what she might be feeling. For the people looking for me. She thought I was dead. She was beside herself. I didn’t care. I just wanted to disappear.
I somehow ended up at my ex-roommate’s apartment. No idea how I got there. He called Ella. She was frantic. He got me a taxi. She opened her door and took me in. I don’t remember any of it.
That was yesterday.
Today, I owned up to everything. The lies. The manipulation. The cheating. The betrayal. It felt awful—because it wasawful. But seeing what I’d done to the only person who ever truly loved me, who stuck by me—that finally broke through the denial.
And now I’m looking into rehab. An inpatient stay. Because I finally realised: I’m a shitty fucking person. I’ve become the kind of man I promised myself I’d never be. And I hate it. I hate that this is who I’ve been. I want to change.
But it’s come at the cost of destroying someone who didn’t deserve it. A person who only ever gave—who loved me in ways I didn’t even know how to receive. A woman who bent over backwards trying to help me, love me, guide me, support me. She carried me.
And I crushed her in return.
I don’t know if she’ll ever come back from what I’ve done. I don’t know if she’ll ever be the same. But I do know this: I’ll never forgive myself for being the reason she stopped believing that love could be safe.

And she was incredible. Still is.

I just wasn’t man enough to deserve her.

I’m (31m) writing this down as objectively as I can. If I start talking, it never comes out right. I’d appreciate it if you could read all of it, because I need it to be heard. I need to be accountable and get help I need to grow as a person. Ella, my ex girlfriend,  (24F) is helping me write it because if you, the reader, will know everything I’ll finally be able to reflect on my past behaviour and work on being a better person. I’m writing it from my point of view to make it easier, but these are Ella’s words too.

Introduction: How we met. How we started. 

---

December 2023

—-


Ella and I met in rehab. I’m an alcoholic; she was a heavy drug user. Total opposites on paper. I’m a clean-cut, easygoing IT sales guy—charming, polished. She was a tattooed, spunky ex-raver. Loud. Electric. A proper session head back in the day. If we hadn’t met in that room, our worlds never would’ve crossed. But somehow, we did—and I’ve never been more grateful for that one-in-a-million chance.

She spotted me first in the home room. She still remembers what I was wearing: black hoodie, shorts, cap, and (in her words) my “big aul Hollywood smile.” I noticed her too. She had two tissues jammed up her nose from her last coke-fueled binge, and still, I was drawn to her. She was loud. Laughed a lot. But beneath it all, I saw the sadness in her eyes. Something real.

I was hooked from the very first conversation.

Part 1: The Breakup. Her redemption. My deception. 

-

This is several months later. May 2024.


We broke up because both of us had a foot out the door. I was closing off. Ella was becoming more erratic. She never brings up anything from before the breakup because she recognises we were both newly sober, traumatised people who had no idea what we wanted. She knows what she did was wrong—talking to a guy in America she’d known for a long time. She hid it. She knew it was emotional cheating and fully accepts that it pushed us toward our first big fallout. She went back to old habits—seeking validation, wanting to feel wanted. Dating sites. I found out through a friend and broke up with her.

She spiralled. Nearly relapsed. Made choices that would’ve led her there. She ended up at her ex’s house—someone who used to be a heavy dealer and generally a shitty person. Ironically, he was sober and was the one who urged her to make things right. That didn’t excuse what she did, but she realised that the pain of hurting me was worse than the comfort of old habits.

She went to A&E and asked for every bit of help she could get. Told her friends, her family, her adopted family. She never once asked me not to tell anyone—she let herself be held accountable. Her own mum told her, straight up, that what she did was horrible and it was on her to change. And even then, she asked everyone around her to look out for me. She told her mum directly, “Be the mum you couldn’t be to me, to him.”

I went to A&E with her—but that was it. I thought being there was enough. I thought I’d done my job.

Throughout the whole breakup, she was honest. No matter how she was feeling, she told me. She was determined to be better—for herself, and for me. She went to therapy. Did an outpatient program for two weeks, then kept going to weekly sessions, both online and in person. After the outpatient part ended, she started looking into aftercare because she knew how close she had come to relapsing. She asked only one thing: if we were going to see other people, to be honest about it. Out of respect. She told me if I wanted to date someone else or sleep with someone else, she’d back off. She repeated that over and over. Gave me so many chances to be honest.

And I lied. 

Part 2: First Relapse. Grief and Relapse. 

I was sober too, at the time. But I hid everything. We were still sleeping with each other when I started seeing Lauren. I lied to two people at once. Manipulated both. Out of fear. Fear of being alone. I prioritised my temporary comfort over how Mel would feel, even after we had promised “no more lies.” Did I work on myself? No. I tried to shag my way out of my feelings. I wasn’t honest with my therapist. Or my friends. Or Mel. Not even with myself.

We saw each other twice at her adoptive dad’s house before things really started to unravel again. She slipped into old, shitty habits. Downloaded a dating app after I told her I wasn’t romantically interested anymore. But she deleted it almost immediately and told me, because we had agreed to be honest. And still, I was annoyed. To the point where she was apologising to me—for downloading a dating app—while I was literally dating and sleeping with someone else.

Then her great-grandmother died. The one who raised her when she was young. She was heartbroken. She could have visited a few weeks before, but she skipped the chance to start therapy. She chose to work on herself instead. I read the messages I sent her during that time and I couldn’t have been less supportive, even when I was trying to be. I was on holiday with Lindsey.

When Ella landed in Romania, it was late. The funeral was the next day. She could tell just from how I was texting that I had been drinking. I was with Lindsey in a bar. I turned off my phone and kept drinking. When I woke up the next day, I didn’t even apologise.

She had stayed awake all night—grieving, anxious, worried about me—just in case I replied. She took time out of the funeral to call me and check on me. Her mum even called me, asking if I was okay, offering to bring me to Romania. They put aside their grief and prioritised me and my relapse.

Looking back at the messages, I didn’t ask her once how she was feeling. I didn’t tell her about Lindsey.

Around then, she started having hormone issues that were getting worse. Doctors didn’t have answers. Test after test. She was constantly tired, freezing cold, foggy. Each blood test came back worse. The appointment with the endocrinologist felt like it was never going to come.

Still, she went to her aftercare. She actually went to two—one full-time, one part-time. And she was honest in all of them. She told people how she hurt me. How she wanted to change. To stay sober. I couldn’t see that.

I broke things off with Lindsey on the last day  of my holiday to try again with Ella. We had a long talk about what we wanted for the future and with each other. We promised openness, honesty, transparency. We said we were going to take this relationship seriously. And for a while, it felt like we meant it.

Then she found out about Lindsey. Three weeks later. I’d deleted an entire chat with a friend. Lied about it—said I was just badmouthing Mel to her which is why I deleted it but she knew something was off. Restored the chat. Found out.

She had every right to be upset. I was defensive. Minimized everything. Blamed her. Brought up what she’d done in the past, ignoring the fact that she was actively working on herself now. That we had turned a new leaf. That we promised to be honest. I hurt her in the exact way she had begged me not to—by lying, by being with another woman. Even though we were broken up, we were still emotionally involved. Still sleeping together. All I had to do was say, “Hey, I want to date other people for a while.” But I didn’t.

The trust broke again. Even though Ella’s spirals had gotten better, the insecurity came flooding back. She lashed out. Got distant. Didn’t know if she could be with me. For 2–3 weeks, she couldn’t decide.

I buried my feelings. Thought, “I forgot about Lindsey easily, why can’t Ella?”

Then she hurt her back. An old injury turned serious. Bulged disc pressing on a nerve. She used to be very active. The gym gave her purpose. Suddenly, that was gone too.


Part 3: Bali. The holiday that broke her. 

Then came Bali. She asked me not to go—for my sobriety. For her doubts about my loyalty, especially in a holiday destination. Because of the wound I left when she found out about Lauren while I was off on another holiday. Her mum was worried too. Tried to talk to me.

I put my foot down. She tried to compromise. “What if you just go for two weeks instead of four?” Again, I said no. I casually suggested she come with me, even though I knew she couldn’t. She had just started her aftercare program and was getting drug tested twice a week.

But I thought, “I deserve this holiday after everything, don’t I?” Instead of staying, instead of prioritising her, or our relationship, or how she felt—I chose myself and “friends,” who weren’t really friends. I ignored that she was in pain. That she was exhausted. That she was still trying.

She still went to therapy. Still doing the work, even in pain. We had to go to A&E again because she could barely walk. She refused stronger meds to protect her sobriety. She was doing everything she could to get stronger.

But I went to A&E with her. Surely that was enough, right?

As soon as I got on the plane to Bali, she blocked me. She was furious and hurt. In her mind, I was choosing a situation that could easily lead to relapse—or worse, cheating—and I’d get away with it. She knew my history. I’d cheated on almost every girlfriend I’d had. I’d always tried to justify it. “It wasn’t really cheating,” or “we weren’t technically together.” But none of that mattered to her. It wasn’t about dating someone else. It was the lying. It was the fact I slept with both her and Lindsey on back-to-back days. That I could’ve exposed her to STIs. That she gave me endless chances to be honest and I still didn’t take them.

She’d been in that position—lying, spiralling—and she felt so sick about it that she went out of her way to change. Why couldn’t I?

Her progress wasn’t perfect, but it was steady. Always moving forward. Blocking me wasn’t just anger—it was fear. Fear of being hurt again. I never stayed blocked for long, usually a few hours. But she felt like extremes were the only way I’d hear her. Talking calmly didn’t work. She was trying to protect herself before I had the chance to hurt her again. But she always came back.  She fully and readily admits it wasn’t healthy but she loved me too much not to.

The whole Bali trip was a mess. Constant arguments. My friend booked a villa, and he told me another girl would be staying there for a while. Mel asked if there were any girls. I lied. Straight to her face. Made her feel paranoid, crazy. She found out eventually. She always does.

And again, she didn’t care about the girl. It was the lie. After Lindsey. After breaking her trust. After saying we’d start fresh. After seeing her sick, grieving, exhausted—I still lied.

She was alone, stuck in bed with a bulging disc, grieving her great-grandmother, dealing with a bunch of scary health issues, and I left. Again.

She started posting more revealing photos with captions like “a wasted summer.” All she wanted was to feel like I gave a shit. And all I did was prove I didn’t.

She looked for validation somewhere else. I saw messages from guys popping up, and she was entertaining them. I’m in Bali, staying true to my word that I wouldn’t be with another girl, “I couldn’t help that my friend arranged to rent out his room”. Not seeing that my lie was the problem. That’s all it took for my head to go to the worst. “She’s at someone else’s house.” I broke up with her and blocked her. Turned off my location. Went out.

What I didn’t tell her was I was taking diazepam. I drank. I hired a prostitute. I was going to sleep with her, but between the Adderall and the drink, I couldn’t get it up. She tried giving me head. Nothing worked. I sent her home.

Then I unblocked Ella.

She was upset. Rightly so. She was scared, confused, trying to figure out what was going on. And I lied. Said I was sober. Said I hadn’t cheated. I twisted it. Made it about her. Got her to apologise to me—knowing full well what I’d done.

All I saw was her reaction, not my actions that caused it. I was still taking lorazepam. Still lying.

Five days later, I relapsed again. Day drinking. I was in a haze. None of my friends stepped in or said anything. Mel posted a picture with her guy friend and I snapped. Felt disrespected. She apologised—even though she didn’t need to. She always did.

I got blackout drunk—mixed alcohol, mirtazapine, lorazepam. Ella could tell immediately just from how I texted. Later she told me she’d been throwing up from the stress of worrying about me.

She called me, got me to send my flight info so she could see when I was coming home. I woke up the next day, realised I couldn’t stay sober out there, and booked the first flight back.

When I got home, I acted like everything was fine. I lied about what happened. Asked Mel not to tell anyone because I was ashamed, but Elle convinced me to own up to my mistakes. And partially I did. But I left out too much. I didn’t think once about how that might make her feel—being asked to keep quiet about my mess.

By that point, she couldn’t even go to her aftercare programs. Her back was so bad. She was later diagnosed with an autoimmune condition. She kept going to therapy. Kept showing up. I wasn’t even honest with my therapist. Couldn’t change, even if I wanted to—and I didn’t want to. I thought showing up was enough.

Part 4. Deceiving her and calling it love.

Her birthday came around. It’s always been a tough day for her—she spent five years deep in addiction, and any birthdays she did remember were tied to abuse or disordered eating. I tried to make a nice day of it. Bought her presents. Took her clothes shopping. But halfway through, she broke down. Thought I was buying her stuff just to shut her up. She didn’t feel worthy of it. She left crying.

We fought. She admits that she went mental and was spiralling but looking back on the messages she was never mean. She was just extremely insecure and self deprecating and hurt. I called her ungrateful. She said she felt like a burden. I didn’t reassure her—I got angry. She got angry too and I used that as an excuse to drink.

She found out. She always does. And even with everything, she came straight over.

That time, I was too ashamed to tell anyone I’d relapsed again. I kept hiding it. From her. From everyone.

Then I got really sick. Had to go to A&E twice. They put me on three different antibiotics and four rounds of steroids. Gave me codeine to help with the coughing and pain. I became incredibly anxious, depressed, and withdrawn. 

Ella stayed with me. Took care of me the whole time. Never once complained.

But it didn’t stop there. Through October and November, I relapsed eight more times. Alcohol. Coke. Codeine. I even went behind everyone’s back to get a benzo prescription. And I drank with it. Said horrible, cruel things to Elle while I was on it.

One night, she just asked me to stay sober long enough for her to rest back at her place. She was exhausted. I said I would. Lied. She ended up sleeping almost two and a half days. While she was out cold, I was drinking. Secretly. She had a feeling. When I admitted it, she came over immediately.

She instantly got in a taxi and called me, begging me to go back inside. When she arrived, I was a mess. Slurring. Trying to get in my car. Didn’t even know what I was doing.

She ended up calling her mum because she couldn’t handle it anymore. Told her everything. And even then, she told me she loved me.

That was the last relapse.

The next morning, she broke down. Slapped me a few times. I had gotten drunk in the morning and taken the last benzo. Still lying to her. Her mum came over and hugged me and basically told me everything was going to be ok and that she loved me. Took us in to theirs. We stayed with her for a few days.

And even then—I still didn’t tell her about Bali. How could I. After everything. Admit to more mistakes. If I just ignore that it happened, it would go away. 

Things stayed rough. Even after promising to change, I was emotionally unavailable. When she told me how she felt—like I didn’t care—I brushed it off. I couldn’t understand what she wanted. I paid the bills, for food, supported her. That’s what love is, right? Gave her empty responses. Half-assed apologies and effort. I’d do things because she’d asked me to, not because I wanted to make things easier for her. She started lashing out again. Getting more and more erratic.

I told her she was reminding me of my dad. The way she spoke. She took it on board instantly. She just wanted to be better. For me. Again.

After Christmas and New Year’s, she crashed.

She couldn’t get out of bed. Couldn’t eat. Couldn’t shower. She cried nearly every day. She couldn’t be strong anymore. She was done with carrying everything. I did my best to support her through that. Helped where I could. She agrees—I was there for her. But even then, I was emotionally distant. Closed off.

Part 5: My epiphany. 

And then something in me finally clicked.

I started seeing it all. Everything she’d done for me. Everything she’d carried for me. Everything I took for granted. Things were amazing. It felt like the relationship just worked, we were in sync, I took her into consideration in whatever I was doing. But I still didn’t give her the truth. 

She was the one who pushed me to get my ADHD diagnosis. She was the only person who looked at me and said, “This isn’t just forgetfulness. Something’s off.” She actually cared enough to notice. To push. To help.

She got her spirals under control. What used to last a whole day now only lasted an hour or two—if that. She stayed sober. After everything I put her through, she still hasn’t relapsed. Sixteen months and counting. Not a single one.

She gave up smoking cigarettes—cold turkey—because she knew I hated the smell. She’s been off them for over a year now. Never once picked one back up.

She got herself organised—something I once mentioned in passing—and she remembered. Changed for it. Because I said it mattered to me.

Since we got back together, she hasn’t lied to me. Not once. And every time I’ve double-checked something she’s said—she was telling the truth.

She went deep into trauma work. Stuff she had buried so deep she forgot it was even there. She made herself relive some of the worst moments of her life because she knew that if she didn’t, they’d keep affecting us. She chose to confront it all, just to try and give us a better shot.

Whenever I felt insecure or angry about her past—most of it from five or more years ago—she didn’t get defensive. She didn’t shut me out. She answered every stupid, insecure question I had, over and over, with patience. She minimised and suppressed events from her past, painted it in a different, more positive light, to protect herself. But I wasn’t able to see that without her spelling it out.

When I said that sometimes the way she spoke reminded me of my father, she changed her tone. Just like that. No argument. She just adjusted, because she didn’t want to make me feel the way he did.

She researched everything she could about ADHD—whiteboards, routines, reminders, medication alarms, grocery planning, fridge labels, all of it—just to help me function better.

She gave me space to talk about anything. Never pressured me. Just gently nudged me to keep digging, keep asking why. She helped me figure out what the hell I was even feeling. No one had ever done that for me before.

She taught me how to make decisions for myself. How to stop and ask, “Is this what I want, or is this guilt, or pressure, or fear?” She taught me how to pause.

She always put me first. No matter what she was going through.

And when she made mistakes? She always owned them. Reflected on them. Apologised. Changed.

She always asked me to tell her if she did something that made me feel uncomfortable, because she wanted to grow. To learn how to love me better.

She remembered everything. Every small thing I mentioned. So every present she ever gave me was thoughtful—something I’d actually need or love. Never a throwaway gift. It always meant something.

Everything she did, she did with 100% effort. Even the food she made—she put her all into it. Just so I could have something nice. Something made with care.

She would always try to teach me and show me ways of doing certain menial tasks better. More efficiently. To make my life easier. Things as simple as “hey, shake the damp clean clothes well before hanging them out. Make sure they’re not crumpled either when you hang them on the line and put the heavy stuff on top and lighter stuff on the bottom because heat travels upward.” Small things like that. In that exact example it was because she knew I didn’t like to to iron and was telling me “hey, your way is good, but try it this way. It’s better!” No one ever taught me. Not when I was young. Not growing up. Not even in recent years.

Every time I came back from a trip, I’d come home to a clean apartment. Groceries in the fridge. She didn’t even live there.

She made an effort to remember my mum. We made a little shrine together. Wrote letters and left them there. No one else in my life had ever done that. No one else had even tried.

She organised things for me in a way that made sense for my ADHD. I never appreciated it properly—I’d mess it all up—and she’d still come back and fix it again.

For the first time. I was with somebody who gave the same effort I’d put in during the times we were intimate. She was open. Giving. Enthusiastic. She made sure it felt like connection, not just a thing we did.

She told me how to love her. Told me how to care for her. Told me how to make her feel safe. I ignored it. Or I half-assed it.

She opened up about things no one else knew. Things she’d buried. Things she was ashamed of. She let me in. And I took it badly. Made it about me. Took me six months to understand what she was even trying to tell me—and she was still patient.

She gave me three chances to tell the truth. I still didn’t.

And somehow, she still loved me.

Six weeks ago, I hadn’t fully processed that. I started to get it—but I didn’t feel it all the way through. I didn’t sit with the weight of it.

But then something shifted. I realised how much I bad-mouthed her to my friends. Told them about her spirals. Her reactions. Made her seem like this crazy, erratic woman. Made her look like the problem. Like she was unstable. When in reality? She was hurting. Reacting to everything I was doing behind her back. And even though I hadn’t done so since I got back from Bali, I only realised then how awful I was being to the one person that cared about me. The gravity of my words about the woman I love.

I started to believe she was in this for real. Even though she’d shown that she was through all my relapses. I started actually thinking about her. What she liked. What she needed. What would make her feel seen. And the change was immediate. She noticed straight away. Started thanking me constantly. But not just “thanks.” It was specific.

“Thank you for picking food I can eat (she has allergies)—it makes me feel cared for.”

“Thanks for bringing me painkillers—I didn’t even realise you’d heard me say I had a headache.”

Simple things. Things I should’ve been doing all along. For the first time, I put her needs ahead of mine. And the relationship changed overnight.

She was less anxious. She didn’t spiral. She was finally happy. For once. I saw her smile again. She didn’t look exhausted or drained or on edge. She had that spark back.

Even when she got pregnant and we decided on an abortion, she kept saying, “Thank you, Alex. Thank you for making me feel loved. For doing so much. For finally being thoughtful.”

That was all she wanted. It was so simple. Just effort and honesty. I was doing the bare minimum, and she was blossoming. That’s when I realised just how much extra she’d been doing for me, all this time and how far off I’d been in my way of showing I cared. 

But even then—even while she was going through the abortion—I found a way to ruin it.

Part 6: Fuck me, I’m an asshole.

Right in the middle of it, I decided to pick a fight. About her ex. The drug dealer. The one she went to when she almost relapsed. Even though she was 18, traumatised, addicted, and vulnerable. Even though she didn’t feel like she had a choice. I made it all about me. About how it made me feel. I couldn’t comprehend how she could like and dislike something and someone at the same time. I thought I was doing something wrong. I was, but not what I thought. While she was cramping, nauseous, bleeding out pieces of placenta—I decided that was the right time to start a fight.

And that night, she found out about the prostitute.

She had a gut feeling. Checked a place she hadn’t checked before. Found proof. And that was it. That was the final straw.

I destroyed everything. Again.

She was done. This was a new level of pain. I’d been given every opportunity to come clean. Every moment to start fresh. She had been begging me—begging me—to just be honest. And I couldn’t do it. I’d told her the worst of my actions. Yet still couldn’t admit to her I’d been drinking and using benzos.

I panicked. Got angry. Defensive. Ashamed. Guilty.  I lost it and stabbed myself in the leg four times trying to hit the artery.

She put all of her pain aside and helped me.

Even though she’d just been up all night talking me through my actions, trying to get through to me—she still cleaned me up. Stopped the bleeding. Went to the pharmacy. Disinfected everything. Stitched me back together with butterfly strips so the scars wouldn’t be too big.

And then she said something I’ll never forget.

She said, “You don’t have any empathy.”

And she was right.

She told me how she sees me. Every version of me. The teenager who lost his mum. The scared boy terrified of his father. The child that had to grow up by himself. The young adult doing anything to fit in, afraid of being alone. The grown man now. I’m still anxious, still lost regarding what I want to do, especially after my dad died. She saw me. Through everything. And she still loved me.

She cried while telling me how she’s always put herself in my shoes. Even after I hurt her. Even after all the betrayal, all the lies, all the pain—I was the one she stayed for. She kept repeating “I’m not taking into account what happened before June. We were both fucked up.” She kept apologising for when she emotionally cheated. For the times she was wrong. For the times she lashed out. But I couldn’t see it, and I couldn’t show her that I cared so fucking much about her too. I was the one she backed. I was the one she tried to build a life with. She reminded me: it wasn’t my friends who showed up. Not my grandparents. Not my family. It was her.

After we broke up. After Lindsey. After Bali. After every relapse. When I was sick and couldn’t move. When I was raw and newly sober. When I kept lying. Even then, she was there.She gave me every chance to be honest. “Please just tell me now. Cheating, relapses—anything. Just say it now.” I swore there was nothing else. For eleven days, I still held onto the lie.

And by then, it was just too late.

I fucked it up. Massively.

I hurt the only person in my 31 years of life who ever loved all of me. Not just the good bits. Not just the parts that were easy. She loved the broken pieces, too. The dark stuff. The bits even I couldn’t face. And I hurt her so badly that now—she’s just numb.

And the worst part is, even now, I still catch myself twisting things. Making her seem manipulative. Telling myself she broke up with me when I told the truth. Painting her as unstable, controlling, abusive. Anything to avoid facing what I’ve actually done.

But this isn’t about her. This is about me. Though it should be about her. It should have always been about her. 

Part 7: Who am I?

I’m a coward.
I’m a liar.
I’m a manipulator.
And I’ve been an all-round shitty person. Especially to the one person who only ever showed me love.

Honestly: I don’t think I was ready to be in a relationship. I thought I was, but I wasn’t. I didn’t want to change. I didn’t want to be vulnerable. I didn’t want to take responsibility. I didn’t want to feel uncomfortable. So I lied. I hid. I numbed myself.

And she just kept giving. She gave me her time. Her energy. Her body. Her patience. Her care. Her loyalty. Her whole self. She gave me effort. Consistency. Forgiveness. Again and again. And she fucking admits when she was and has been wrong. She talked to me about it after. She listened to me and took on board everything I said. Even now she admits with no “ifs” or “buts” or shitty explanations to shit she’s done and said in the past that have hurt me. She takes accountability and she tries to be consistently better afterwards. 

When she found out about the prostitute I literally watched the light drain from her eyes. That was a new level of betrayal. One she couldn’t come back from but she still was OPEN TO TRY PROVIDED I TOLD HER THE TRUTH. And she still helped me. Still patched me up. Still cleaned my wounds. Still told me, somehow, that she loved me.

I didn’t just hurt her feelings. I changed how she saw the world. How she saw love. I made her question whether effort and kindness and growth were even worth it.

And that’s on me.

I made her feel like nothing she did mattered. Like none of her progress counted. Like she was still “crazy” or “too much” or “paranoid” even when she was right. Even when her gut was spot on, I told her she was imagining things.

I gaslit her.

I lied, over and over, and every time I got caught, I shifted the blame. Brought up her past. Made her feel like she had no right to be upset.

Even though she’d changed. She’d healed. She had done everything she said she would. She showed up for me over and over again, even when I didn’t deserve it.

And I couldn’t even tell her the truth.

The most painful part is how easy it would’ve been to just be honest. All she ever wanted from me was the truth and some fucking effort. That’s it. Not money. Not perfection. Just honesty and a real shot at being a team.

But I kept making the same choices. Choices that hurt her. And now, she stopped hoping I’d change. There’s nothing I can say to undo that. No apology big enough. No grand gesture that’ll fix it. I’ve said sorry so many times it doesn’t mean anything anymore.

An apology without change is just manipulation and kindness without honesty is deceit. 

She gave me everything she could. And I threw it away. Over and over again. I couldn’t stop lying, even when the truth would’ve set both of us free. She told me—begged me—to be honest. To just say it. To rip the plaster off. And I still waited and let it fester for 11 fucking days. Let her sit there thinking maybe, maybe this time he’s telling the truth.

And every time I chose silence, I chipped away at the last bit of trust she had in me. I get to sit with the fact that I had something most people never find, and I fucking destroyed it.

She was everything I ever wanted. She pushed me. Made me uncomfortable in ways I needed to be. Called me out. Called me in. She fucked up and she owned up to it. When she made mistakes she’d admit them. She fucking thanked me for making her feel okay in the way she looked, in the way she dressed. That I didn’t once shame her or make her feel less than for her scars. For how she was. I realise now that this was the bare minimum. She gave me more chances than I deserved. And yet I still made her feel small. Like none of that mattered. Like her love didn’t count. But it did. She loved me in ways I didn’t even know how to receive. And all she asked for in return was the truth. Real effort. For me to care in the way she cared. To meet her halfway.

And I couldn’t do it.

Part 7: The last lie.

I still struggle with the truth—even now. Even after telling her everything I’ve done, I can’t fully accept that it is the truth. That I really did those things. Slowly, one by one, all my lies have unravelled. When she found out about the prostitute in Bali, she started combing through every detail from the past year and a half. Things surfaced I didn’t even remember doing—things I did while sober. I’d shoved it so deep, even seeing it in black and white barely convinced me it happened.
She told me to come clean to her parents. And I did—about the things she already knew. When they asked if there was anything else, if I could just tell them the rest, they said, “We can work through it.” I promised I’d told them everything.
That was a lie.
I left out that I’d slept with my ex one more time after we’d broken up. Something I denied for a year and three months—every time she asked. I’d convinced myself it didn’t happen. That it wasn’t a big deal. That because it didn’t mean anything to me, I didn’t need to admit it.

I was wrong.

I also went on dating apps way more than I remembered. Nothing came of it, and it never went further than the apps—but it was still cheating. I was still looking elsewhere. There’s no excuse for it. And still, I tried to hold back the truth. Even after her parents showed they could forgive me for the worst things I’d done to their daughter, I still couldn’t be honest. Because I didn’t think they’d find out.
And maybe they wouldn’t have. But eventually, I told Ella. I told her about the dates I went on while in Cyprus—dates with a girl whose name I don’t even remember. We kissed twice. Nothing more. But that’s not the point. I wasn’t loyal. I wasn’t honest. I was scared of being alone, and I used that fear as a license to hurt people.
I made her think she was the disloyal one. I made her feel guilty for messaging exes or downloading an app after I found her texting someone. When I had already done worse. One rule for her. A completely different rulebook for me.
And all the while, I thought I was treating her well. That I was giving her what she needed in a relationship. I don’t know how I got so deluded.
When I finally came clean about my ex and the date, it was after a year and three months of gaslighting her. Something she first suspected when she saw messages I had deleted. Something she’d asked me about over and over, and every time, I made her feel insane for even thinking it.

And still—it took me 11 days to admit it. After she’d gone through an abortion. After she’d found out about the prostitute. After everything. And even then, when she gave me yet another chance to tell the truth, to finally stop running, I couldn’t fucking do it.

So I self-destructed. Like I always do.

I stole alcohol from her apartment. I drank. I drove. I stole wine from a shop at 7:30 in the morning. I drank again. I drove until I ran out of petrol—an hour and a half from home. I was blackout drunk. No plan. No phone. Nobody to turn to. I ditched my phone in a coffee shop so no one could track me, then wandered the streets, drinking as much as I could, hoping I’d die.

That’s how little regard I had for her. For what she might be feeling. For the people looking for me. She thought I was dead. She was beside herself. I didn’t care. I just wanted to disappear.
I somehow ended up at my ex-roommate’s apartment. No idea how I got there. He called Ella. She was frantic. He got me a taxi. She opened her door and took me in. I don’t remember any of it.
That was yesterday.
Today, I owned up to everything. The lies. The manipulation. The cheating. The betrayal. It felt awful—because it wasawful. But seeing what I’d done to the only person who ever truly loved me, who stuck by me—that finally broke through the denial.
And now I’m looking into rehab. An inpatient stay. Because I finally realised: I’m a shitty fucking person. I’ve become the kind of man I promised myself I’d never be. And I hate it. I hate that this is who I’ve been. I want to change.
But it’s come at the cost of destroying someone who didn’t deserve it. A person who only ever gave—who loved me in ways I didn’t even know how to receive. A woman who bent over backwards trying to help me, love me, guide me, support me. She carried me.
And I crushed her in return.
I don’t know if she’ll ever come back from what I’ve done. I don’t know if she’ll ever be the same. But I do know this: I’ll never forgive myself for being the reason she stopped believing that love could be safe.

And she was incredible. Still is.

I just wasn’t man enough to deserve her.

Its been great until I moved into this new appartement, which has carpets almost everywhere. So I decided to get a simple robovac that only has a vacuum feature.After some research, I settled on the X5 Hybrid, I didn't care much about the removeable stick but it turns out I use it a lot more often than I thought.

I found it quite useful for quick cleanups, like yesterday morning I spilled some coffee powder on the floor, I just picked up the stick and moved the robot to where I wanted it to be, pressed the power button on the stick and done. I don't have to open the app - select the cleaning area - and wait for the robovac to take its time. Honestly, it'a lot easier than I thought, just give it a gentle push and the robovac moves smoothly. The suction is also good, no problem picking up long hairs and does not tangle at all. 

I know a lot of people are going with the stick vacuum plus steam mop combination to do the house cleaning, I am just glad to find another possibility, but if you have a better way to do carpet cleaning, please let me know in the comment! Thanks!!",1,1743648214.0,ecovacs,1,1.0,False

1jq79p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1jq79p8/really_bizarre_dream_about_my_childhood_abuse_and/,Really bizarre dream about my childhood abuse and Batman Forever,"This was a really weird dream, so stick with me here.

  
The first half was really troubling. My mom had gotten back with a guy that she was dating when I was in middle school who was really emotionally abusive towards me. Except in this dream, he was even more physical and malicious than he ever was. I was in my mom's bedroom asking her about something and he proceeds to throw a coffee mug at me and then he went somewhere (I don't remember where). I told my mom that his track record had been really bad lately and that I had to leave home because I was actually afraid he would kill me. I then went into a night table drawer on his side of the bed and found a Swiss army knife and three guns, which solidified my decision. I gathered everyone around and told them I was leaving and his kids (who weren't actually his real kids, they were my mom's current boyfriend's daughters) were really torn up about me leaving for some reason and were crying. My mom was crying too, but my brother was more optimistic and knew that we would hang out again in the very near future so he wasn't as sad. I then went on my way.

  
The second half of the dream is where it becomes more fun, but also more weird. I drove to a town about 15 minutes away from mine, but it looked different, looking more like a desertous version of the Hollywood Hills. And in the center of everything was a large scale replica of Wayne Manor from the film ""Batman Forever"". I went inside to find the interiors were accurate to the movie as well and that it was some sort of museum. I looked around, but deliberately chose to not enter the Batcave yet because I wanted to save it for the end. Most of the first floor was screen accurate, but the upstairs was a Dave and Busters style arcade themed after the movie. I distinctly remember one room had a game called ""Hunt the Riddler"", a sort of laser tag/shooting gallery thing where you shot Riddler goons and then the Riddler himself with laser guns. I then ran into an old buddy of mine from middle school I hadn't seen in a long time and we looked around a bit more before finally going down into the Batcave and then leaving out the backdoor. I then asked if I could live with him for a little bit and he agreed before the dream ended.

  
The only part of the dream I understand was why it was themed after ""Batman Forever"". I took melatonin last night to help me sleep and just before I finally fell asleep, my brother texted me that Val Kilmer had died. But everything else is a mystery. Why was my mom's ex being so mean to me? Why did the nearby town look like LA? Why was part of the museum an arcade? Why did I run into my middle school friend? I'm legitimately confused lol

  
TL;DR: I dreamed about running away from home to avoid my mom's abusive boyfriend, ending up in a ""Batman Forever"" themed museum, and reuniting with a friend from my youth.",1,1743648179.0,DreamInterpretation,0,0.99,False

I am a 5'5"" 205 lb 38 year old Female. 
I wake at 4:30 am, then I go to the gym at 5:30 and do cardio for 20 minutes, then either weights, yoga, or swimming for 40 minutes 

If I drink coffee all day with light half n half, (probably ~100 calories total), and then break my ""fast"" around 3-6pm, to consume 2 glasses of wine (250 calories) and then eat a reasonably well balanced 1500 calorie meal [1850 calories total] will this -

A) sustain me during my workout and following workday?

B) cause me to lose weight?

Background:

After being healthy and fit my entire young life, I started gaining weight in my late 20s, and I've been *this* overweight for the last 5 years.

I originally gained the weight through excessive drinking, depression eating, stress eating, and quitting working out 

I have always been a big/frequent eater, even when I was 125 lbs of muscle 

I have tracked my calories at many points during the last few years, but I find it exhausting to enter calories for several meals each day

Recently I quit drinking for 6 months thinking I would at least lose *some* weight - but no, I lost nothing, which is crazy to me because I'm certain I was consuming around 3000 calories daily back them and now it's like 2400 calories daily

But quitting drinking taught me something - finding sources of ""dopamine"" throught the day is critical to a sense of well being... food is one of those sources

I know, I know, ""find healthier sources of dopamine"", but I'm poor as shit, single, don't own a car, and have a ton of responsibilities on my back at the moment... I go to the gym and play guitar daily. I practice mindful mediation and go to therapy twice a week. I am on Metformin. It's still not enough to curb the *strong* desire to over eat.

So I am drinking again (normal amounts this time)    

And I am wondering if OMAD would be a good idea for a ""volume eater"" like me

I also figure it'll be alot easier to track calories with OMAD

The only thing is, I don't think I could do without the little bit of half and half in my coffee during the day - black coffee on an empty stomach makes me hurl, and I have severe ADHD that can't be treated with meds due to side effect intolerance (I've tried them *all*), so strong coffee is all I've got

What do you guys think? Anyone here like me? Could this work or will I possibly over eat at night due to fasting all day?

So I was semi-recovered when my friend began to develop an ED as well (which indirectly led me to relapse, oops). Now, because I know how shitty this disorder is, I’ve always made it a point to hide it from other people and avoid weight loss talk around others. ESPECIALLY girls my age because I know we’re the ones who get hit the worst with body image issues, unrealistic beauty standards etc etc 

Anyways the point is, if I got invited out to eat or if someone was having a party and gave me cake, I participated. I fasted or restricted a day before the event and after, but not during. I did not talk about the calories or the sodium’s or sugars or anything negative about the food. 

Unfortunately my friend is the complete opposite and broadcasts her ED, even to new people we’ve barely met. She is gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free and will make it a point to only order Diet Coke or black coffee to any outing. She criticizes the menu and calories of places we’re invited to as well.  

I see where she’s coming from 100% and have tried to be inclusive in our outings but I just don’t understand how she can be so blatant about not eating without worrying about others catching on. And yes, she has a therapist and psychiatrist for this and her parents are aware and I check in with her weekly, but that still does not make it any easier that her struggles just seem to make me fall harder into my own ED. 

The worst part is that our other friends have began to feel self conscious while eating in front of her and asked me not to include her on certain invitations bc we know she’s going to complain about the food anyways. It makes me feel so guilty bc I know that’s pushing her further into isolation but nothing I say gets through to her. ",11,1743647989.0,EDAnonymous,7,1.0,False

For context she will turn 10 months next week and has recently learned to stand and walk with support - while all that is super adorable and i have a zillion videos of her doing all that very cutely, she wants to do that for every meal and its not safe for her and not sustainable. Shes a foodie - loves and eats whatever i put on her plate (i feel so blessed) but she wants to eat in weird positions - every time i put her in her high chair, she will stand up holding the sides, bend down to pick a morsel of food and stand back up to eat it and then repeat again. The problem with this is she eats like this for about 2 mins which is 10% of her food and quickly realizes she can walk/jump and wants to do that while she is on the chair. My hands are busy making sure she does not fall over coz her balance is still wonky and shes likely to throw herself in any direction she wishes. If i buckle her down, she will fuss/cry/scream and twist herself with all her strength to get out of the buckle and if that happens she wont even eat the 10%.
i would love to hear if anyone else has experienced something like this with their munchkin and what did you do to make your determined and fearless small little human to sit down and finish their plate?
Also if i give up and get her out of the chair she will keep coming back and pointing towards it and thats how i know she does want to eat so it’s not the food.
And i don’t want to serve her food elsewhere - on the coffee table for example coz i want to teach her that food is served and consumed at the dinner table with everyone.",3,1743647665.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

by Preston Dennett

Face-to-face contact with a humanoid ET – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s occurring to a huge number of people. It’s been happening across the planet for a very long time. While our governments are now admitting that UFOs are real, they still refuse to talk about humanoids. The question is why? Is it because these kinds of encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have much to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten incredible cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. These include multi-witness cases with supporting evidence. The time for truth is now!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. One summer morning in 1948, Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids. They spoke briefly then returned to their craft, which took off, leaving strange landing traces in the field.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and his two co-employees were maintaining the tracks of the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a strange craft appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, promptly returned into the craft. The UFO flew off with such a loud noise that it made the witnesses physically sick.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland after visiting a friend. Suddenly a tall, thin, green-skinned humanoid appeared, levitating above his head. Anssi panicked and biked away. The being disappeared into a craft, which then began to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a strange unidentified liquid.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms not far from his home in Bedarrides, France. Movement caught his eyes and he observed what he thought were two small children. But they wore fully-body, beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. When Antoine called out to them, they laughed and fled into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of kids from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object at low elevation by the nearby treeline. As they watched, it glided overhead, stopped, and then landed a short distance away. Both boys saw the figure of a humanoid looking down at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with portholes hovering near their farm. It then ejected two very short figures with glowing red eyes who glided above the ground, came onto their property, and began to inspect their farm. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area around that time.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking through a construction site by his home in Cosenza, Italy when everything around him lit up like daylight. Looking around, he saw a strange craft landed on a nearby hill. A weird humanoid stood on top of it. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by the humanoids, each dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. He tried to fight them, fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10:00 pm on the evening of November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was drinking coffee in the kitchen his home in Daviken, Sweden when he observed a strange-looking figure just a few feet from his house, in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture with its arms outstretched and its legs spread widely. It wore an unusual, shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to get a closer look, he saw the figure disappear into thin air. Rune later learned that a police officer saw a UFO the same night, which caused his cruiser to mysteriously stall. Rune also learned that a year earlier, his neighbor saw a strange, short humanoid, which disappeared the same way.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one night in the summer of 1999 when a fourteen-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching noise right outside the window of her second-story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange three-foot-tall being with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed into the bedroom, and saw it too. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten incredible humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a small portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many types of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is now over. We are being visited by aliens.

Hey MaximizeMe crew! 👋

Let’s have a real talk about the love-hate relationship many of us have with multitasking. Ever tried juggling *breakfast*, *emails*, and that lingering *cat hairball* under the couch all at once? Pretty sure I’m not the only one who’s found my brain trying to be a circus performer without realizing it's dropped all the proverbial balls! 🎪

I used to think multitasking was the secret sauce to productivity. Spoiler alert: it’s actually the recipe for chaos! 😅 Turns out, our brains aren’t great at genuine multitasking. **It splits your focus**, **increases stress**, and let’s be honest, makes you forget whether you shampooed your hair or just conditioned it twice. 🙃

So, here's what worked wonders for me: **10-Minute Habit Stacking**. 💡

**What’s Habit Stacking, you ask?**

Imagine pairing smaller tasks together that naturally fit—like stacking LEGO for your life! 🧩 Here’s how I cut through the noise and saved a whopping 10 hours a week:

- **Morning Freshness**: 
  - Combine stretching with planning your day. While stretching out those sleepy muscles in the morning, mentally walk through your top priorities. 
  - Pro-tip: Add a dash of gratitude—saying out loud three things you’re thankful for while you reach for the sky. 🧘‍♂️

- **Coffee + Reading**: 
  - Instead of scrolling (you know we all do it), dive into a 10-minute podcast or audiobook while sipping your coffee. Boom! Skills upgraded with your caffeine boost. ☕📚

- **Lunch Hustle**: 
  - Turn lunchtime into learning time. Listen to educational videos that don’t require you to stare at a screen—perfect for when your mouth and brain are both working. 😉🍽️

- **Commute Focus**:
  - If you're driving, line up podcasts or motivational playlists that pump you up for the day ahead or help you unwind. For public transport riders? Fabulous moment to mind map any ideas that float around. 🚗🚌🎧

**Why It Works:**
- It's all about **enhancing focus**—because when you layer habits, you're reducing the brain's need to switch gears constantly. 
- You’re not trying to do *everything all the time*, but rather a few things that complement each other well.
- The hidden bonus? Seriously lowers stress levels and makes the day feel *more like a smooth sail*, less like a hectic race. 🌊

I (26F) have been experiencing intense period-like cramps around the same time every night. It’s always after I’ve eaten dinner and time for bed is coming close. I know it’s not my period because I take birth control pills and only get my period when I take the iron pills once every 3 months. I don’t miss doses and I’ve never had bleeding outside of when I’m scheduled to. Period comes and goes like clockwork. 

A few months ago I had a Pap smear come back abnormal. I had a colposcopy and ended up having 3 biopsy samples taken. Two were benign and one was “mild cervical dysplasia” I was told this was no big deal and I just have to get a pap every year now. Totally dreading this because Pap smears are so painful. It’s more the speculum that’s painful than anything else but I’ve been made to feel dramatic. The biopsies being taken in my colposcopy were so painful I was bawling my eyes out and having a panic attack. The doctor could not get the bleeding to stop for quite some time and I ended up having that weird coffee-ground stuff coming out for way longer than they said it would. I also had a metallic smell for weeks. 

Before the abnormal pap, I had a day last summer where I had this weird clump of something come out of me and some really intense on and off cramps for days. I saw the doctor and all STI tests were negative. However, my cervix was painful to the touch and there was a discharge so they sent me to the ER for fear that I was having PID. They found nothing wrong and sent me home with advil. No surprise there. 

I went to the doctor again because the cramps did not stop. The doctor considered I may have endometriosis but wasn’t willing to do a laparoscopy AND I QUOTE “until the pain was unbearable” so he prescribed me medicine for it - called Orilissa. I took it for 6 months and noticed it helped a bit, mostly just dulled the cramps. Didn’t get rid of them. Had to stop taking it because the night sweats it was giving me actually were unbearable. 

Now we are current. The only other symptoms I’ve been having is that my bowel movements are really not great. Not super regular and when they do happen it’s now or never. I get this intense stomach pain and onset of nausea if I wait even 5 minutes before going to the bathroom. I am also VERY gassy - both burping and farting unfortunately. And the gas is horrible smelling. I swear my boyfriend doesn’t even want to be near me when it happens. 

Has anyone experience anything like this? What is the problem? Is it my stomach? Do I have endometriosis? Am I just disgusting and screwed? 

TLDR; experiencing stomach and reproductive pain and other symptoms. Looking for others who have had similar issues and what they’ve done. I have a doctor’s appointment coming up where I’ll try to explore the stomach part of it since it’s fairly new.

She said that should be good and I thanked her for helping me and I thought that was the end of everything. 

I saw her this morning and everything seemed fine, I even offered to make her breakfast and coffee and cleaned up my FIL dishes. Nothing seemed to be wrong until I heard them arguing while I was in the bathroom how I messed up the oven and how my MIL told me to clean it but I didn’t, which wasn’t true at all. I’ve always cleaned for my in laws no matter what, even doing their spring cleaning for them immediately when asked! I wanted to talk to them about it but I went to my husband and he said if they don’t bring it up to my face then it’s not that big of a deal. He went out to talk to them and they lied again, saying that she told me to do it but I didn’t, and asked if I told him about it. He said he didn’t hear about it but we’ll clean it tonight.

My problem is I don’t know what I’m gonna do when I see them, I have to see them in the morning for work because they’re always in the living room and I know my FIL is going to say something about it to me. My FIL is a VERY hotheaded person and will go 0-100 over the smallest of things, if I say his wife lied he’s going to immediately start a screaming match with me and my husband too. I don’t want to cause any problems but it hurts me so much emotionally to have to lie about this. I wouldn’t something like that, I pride myself in being responsible and this just feels like a slap in the face. My husband says I should say the truth but the fear of getting yelled is too much. We move out next month so I was thinking I should just lie and say it slipped my mind and apologize. What’s the smartest way to go about this?",2,1743646817.0,makemychoice,19,0.75,False
1jq6sra,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingsPhilippines/comments/1jq6sra/need_some_advice_please_what_do_you_think_of_our/,Need some advice please! What do you think of our cocktail hour food?,"Hi everyone! We have around 80 guests for the wedding.  
Just to give you a quick overview of the schedule:

* Ceremony starts at 1:00 PM (guest call time is 12:45 PM)
* Cocktail hour begins at 3:30 PM
* Dinner will start at either 6:00 PM or 7:00 PM



**I’d love your thoughts on our cocktail hour food.**

1. We're planning to get **Dunkin' Donuts** and here’s the lineup:

* 100 regular-sized donuts
* 80 pieces of ham and cheese Bunwiches (for a savoury option)
* 250 Munchkins

2. We’ll also have an **Ice Cream and Coffee/Juice Cart**.

What do you think of this setup? There won’t be any additional food aside from Dunkin’ since the corkage fee for each food cart is ₱10,000.

P.S. I know the number of donuts seems more than enough for the guests, but Dunkin' has a minimum order requirement of ₱12,000.

  
Also, we don't like grazing tables etc.

  
Thank you!!

I think like 10 of these might be cavities

Non smoker, brush my teeth twice a day, floss at least once a week 
I just don't understand how this could happen
I eat a lot of sugar /drink soda and coffee often but other than that I thought I took pretty good care of them 
im making an appointment right now so I'm not sure what I'm asking for but maybe reassurance idk I'm afraid

Even so, no signs of UTI, minerals are normal as well, they even tested how well my kidneys are filtering my blood. I also had image exams of my kidneys, uterus, bladder and urethra, all of which were absolutely normal according to my gynecologist  ≈ 1 year ago or so.

However, I feel discomfort peeing, my urethra burns, it is followed by the feeling of not having fully emptied my bladder (this feeling doesn't go away unless I drink A LOT of water, but it doesn't ever FULLY go away). Sometimes it also burns randomly through the day even when I don't have a full bladder. It gets especially bad if I don't drink a lot of water, it feels as if there's something blocking my urethra, and if I try really hard to make the remaining urine come out (which hurts quite a lot) it comes out absolutely burning.
I also have really bad back pain around my lower back, however I am a student who carries a considerably heavy backpack for most of the day, and I spend around 3 hours standing up so I can commute to university.
My urine smells normal, it also has it's usual color (despite being really transparent because of the amount of water I drink in order to feel less uncomfortable).
I've tried changing my diet, stopped drinking soda, coffee and alcohol, but nothing really happened despite it feeling slightly less uncomfortable.

The only medication I take is my birth control (I've been taking it for a year and a half). 
I don't have any history of illness besides being anemic a bit too often, but I have since then had iron infusions and I haven't been anemic anymore for a year or so. My grandmother is diabetic, my insulin levels are normal however.
I went to the doctor for this specific issue once, but they only gave me an antibiotic which made the problem go away for 2 weeks, and then it came back. Because of this I have taken other antibiotics, but they didn't have any results at all.
I have sex every month or so with my boyfriend, we use protection and I properly wash myself after. I however have not had any problems like this prior to meeting him.
I have been sedentary for most of my life.
I can provide my blood work results if needed.
I really need help, this has been driving me nuts.",2,1743646731.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

She said that should be good and I thanked her for helping me and I thought that was the end of everything.
