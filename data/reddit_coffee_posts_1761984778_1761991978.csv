I’m writing my first novel after writing a couple of screenplays and a few short stories (unpublished). I’m about 50,000 words into my first draft, with ten chapters left to write. I’m lucky enough to have the time to go away to a cottage for a week to write. Hoping to get them all done, so probs going to have to write two chapters a day! I’m averaging about 3-4000 words per chapter atm. 

Does anyone have any tips for long haul writing stints? Brain foods? Coffee? Writing exercises to get into the flow? Good planning techniques?",1,1761991791.0,writing,0,1.0,False

Howdy! It’s wonderful to meet whoever is reading this and may be interested in…whatever? I’m kinda just looking for friends or potentially more, I got out of a relationship and kinda realized I didn’t really have many friends, and it’s EXTREMELY hard to meet people out here, so I’ll love to get to know some people, and if things go REALLY well, take it further than even just friends if you want.

By the way, I don’t really care for how old you are- but I don’t really want someone who’s my mom age as a friend, since that would be EXTREMELY awkward, so 18 through 33 is my range atm, with 36 as a hard limit.

Now, about me! I feel like I’m a very open minded person, and I do tend to lean left, but I’m more of a centralist, willing to learn and take in all information I can. I personally feel that if you’re not open to receiving new info, or criticism to your own thoughts, then you can’t truly grow as a person and form your true self without hindrance. I also do like to go on walks, play video games (I just got a switch not too long ago, so I’ve been really getting into all of the Pokemon games and will probably get Legends: ZA in the next week or 2, I also play PlayStation), I do also work out- so if your looking for a workout partner, I’ll love to be that! I do enjoy walks, going out and also exploring the wilderness! There is also this nice beach near where I live, so if you ever wanna meet up there, I’ll love to set something up! Just know, the first time I meet someone will have to be in a public space like a store, coffee shop, mall or such, for my own safety. I am also 5’8, mixed (black/white), and I do work nights, so I’m free all day.

I’m also willing to exchange selfies and how I look with you, just know I’m not the type to take a bunch of photos, so they probably won’t be the best ones 😭. But yea- feel free to message me, and if you want, could always go to other socials such as insta, snap or such!",1,1761991664.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I am in the first year of high school and I have an assignment in financial literacy and entrepreneurship in the sector. 

My task is to make a presentation about one city (I chose Mexico City) and graphically approach the costs of living there. Net pay to us It is €2,000 and we are single.

The professor gave us a table as an example of costs (not all of them need to be filled in) 

Costs :

Rent Utilities (water, electricity, TV, garbage collection, internet, mobile phone) 

Food 

Transport 

Clothes and shoes 

Entertainment (going out) 

Activities (hobbies, fitness) 

Streaming services 

Health service 

Hygiene and cosmetics

 Pets 

Savings

Other (coffee, lunch at work, cigarettes) 

Car loan

Chapter 1 

On the third day of my boyfriend Christiano Hughes giving me the silent treatment, I died in the ice cellar. No one found me for three 

years. 

My soul wandered around the world for three years, unable to move 



The keeper of souls handed me the phone I used when I was alive. 

“Stephanie Vasquez, you’re holding on too tightly. I’ll give you three days to settle your unfinished business. When the time is up, you’ll have to move on.” 

I snapped out of my daze when I heard the phone ringing in my hand. 

The screen lit up, “Incoming call-Christiano”. 

\*\*\* 

I pressed the answer key. Christiano’s voice, one I hadn’t heard in so long, came through the phone. 

“Stephanie, the last stop for my world tour will be in Las Vegas. Are you coming to my concert?” 

The familiar voice carried a cold tone that made my hand tremble as I held the phone. 

“Congratulations. Your dream has come true.” 

0.00% 

I looked at my transparent soul and whispered. 

“But I don’t think I can make it to your concert.” 

On the other end, Christiano stayed silent for a long time before speaking again. 

“Why? Afraid to show up after seeing how successful I am now? 

“Three years ago, when you dumped me because I was poor, I swore I’d make you regret it.” 

His icy tone made my heart tighten. 

Three years ago, we argued about whether to build a family or a career first. 

I tried to calm down by cleaning the house. When I was tidying the basement, I also took the opportunity to clean the ice cellar. 

But I suffered from low blood sugar because I hadn’t eaten all day. I fainted, and eventually froze to death in the ice cellar. 

He thought I had abandoned him without a word. He left the place we rented together, signed a contract with an agency, and moved to New York to develop his career. 

Now he was famous, but we were separated by life and death. 

I was about to reply when he spoke again. 

“I left the ticket at 24 Devoe Street. Remember to pick it up.” 

Then he hung up. 

lived in six years ago. 

Back in sophomore year, to make it easier for him to practice singing, we didn’t stay in the dorms. We rented a small house in Las Vegas instead. 

Back then, to scrape together his audition fee, I worked every weekend. 

I handed out flyers, collected recyclables, and even walked ten blocks a day picking up bottles. My feet were covered with blisters. 

But when he hummed a love song to me in our home, I felt it was all 

worth it. 

After I died, I had tried to go back there. 

But for some reason, it was like there was a barrier blocking me from getting close to that door. 

This time though, I came in without any trouble and reached the door of our home. 

There was a little yard in front of the house. When we first moved in, Christiano and I planted a few grape vines there. 

After a year of care, the vines grew strong, filling the trellis, but they never bore fruit. 

I had asked experts online why, but I couldn’t find the reason. 

All those years living there, I never got to taste a single grape. I

wondered how they were now after three years. 

I took a few steps forward. When I passed the mailbox, I saw a blue 

card inside. 

“2025 Christiano Hughes World Tour-Las Vegas, VIP Ticket” 

I tried to pull it out, but when my fingers touched the card, they went right through it. 

Looking at the man on the ticket, dressed in a blue costume, holding a starry microphone, looking dazzling, I whispered. 

“Christiano, I really wish I could sit in the audience and watch your concert, but I can’t even touch the ticket.” 

Just then, headlights flashed. A black Maybach stopped steadily in front of the gate. 

The door opened, and long legs stretched out. Polished shoes hit the concrete with a dull thud. 

Seeing Christiano in person made my head spin. 

For the past three years, I had only seen him on billboards and TV. 

He wore a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and a faint chill seemed to surround him. 

He looked so different from the man I saw on TV. 

“Christiano…” 

I called softly. He turned his head in my direction but walked straight 

through me to open the gate. 

Watching his back, I remembered that I’d been dead for three years. He couldn’t see me. 

My soul followed him into the yard. The bare walls were now covered in ivy. 

The grape vines I once cared for had flourished and were now heavy with green grapes. 

It turned out that in the three years since I’d left, they had borne fruit. But I would never get to taste them. 

Christiano paused at the sight of the vines. For a brief moment, something flickered in his eyes. 

But just as quickly, he looked away and walked to the front door. 

The electronic lock glowed. He hesitated a moment, then entered the 

code. 

“417823” 

I froze. He hadn’t changed it-it was still the code I set. 

The first three numbers were his birthday. The last three were mine. 

He pushed the door open and turned on the lights. 

The place was exactly how it looked the day I stormed off. 

On the floor, our couple photos lay scattered after being torn off the wall during a fight. 

Even the two cat-car mugs on the coffee table sat apart, as if separated by a canyon. 

Christiano stared at the photos on the ground, his gaze darkening. 

“Stephanie, you never came back in these three years. You’re so cruel.” 

He stared for a long time before pulling out his phone. “Come to 24 Devoe Street.” 

I didn’t know what he was planning. I just kept watching his face to see how much he had changed. 

Soon, a group of housekeeping staff in uniforms came into the yard. 

Christiano pointed at the photos of me on the wall and spoke. 

“Clear out everything in this house that has to do with her.”

After a year of care, the vines grew strong, filling the trellis, but they never bore fruit. 

I had asked experts online why, but I couldn’t find the reason. 

All those years living there, I never got to taste a single grape. I

wondered how they were now after three years. 

I took a few steps forward. When I passed the mailbox, I saw a blue 

card inside. 

“2025 Christiano Hughes World Tour-Las Vegas, VIP Ticket” 

I tried to pull it out, but when my fingers touched the card, they went right through it. 

Looking at the man on the ticket, dressed in a blue costume, holding a starry microphone, looking dazzling, I whispered. 

“Christiano, I really wish I could sit in the audience and watch your concert, but I can’t even touch the ticket.” 

Just then, headlights flashed. A black Maybach stopped steadily in front of the gate. 

The door opened, and long legs stretched out. Polished shoes hit the concrete with a dull thud. 

Seeing Christiano in person made my head spin. 

For the past three years, I had only seen him on billboards and TV. 

He wore a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and a faint chill seemed to surround him. 

He looked so different from the man I saw on TV. 

“Christiano…” 

I called softly. He turned his head in my direction but walked straight 

through me to open the gate. 

Watching his back, I remembered that I’d been dead for three years. He couldn’t see me. 

My soul followed him into the yard. The bare walls were now covered in ivy. 

The grape vines I once cared for had flourished and were now heavy with green grapes. 

It turned out that in the three years since I’d left, they had borne fruit. But I would never get to taste them. 

Christiano paused at the sight of the vines. For a brief moment, something flickered in his eyes. 

But just as quickly, he looked away and walked to the front door. 

The electronic lock glowed. He hesitated a moment, then entered the 

code. 

“417823” 

I froze. He hadn’t changed it-it was still the code I set. 

The first three numbers were his birthday. The last three were mine. 

He pushed the door open and turned on the lights. 

The place was exactly how it looked the day I stormed off. 

On the floor, our couple photos lay scattered after being torn off the wall during a fight. 

Even the two cat-car mugs on the coffee table sat apart, as if separated by a canyon. 

Christiano stared at the photos on the ground, his gaze darkening. 

“Stephanie, you never came back in these three years. You’re so cruel.” 

He stared for a long time before pulling out his phone. “Come to 24 Devoe Street.” 

I didn’t know what he was planning. I just kept watching his face to see how much he had changed. 

Soon, a group of housekeeping staff in uniforms came into the yard. 

Christiano pointed at the photos of me on the wall and spoke. 

“Clear out everything in this house that has to do with her.”

I’ve noticed a lot of us in Bangkok, remote workers, freelancers, digital nomads, students, often end up working solo in cafés or at home. It’s productive… until it isn't. 

So a few of us started hosting casual coworking meetups around the city, think small groups, laptops, good coffee, and quiet focus with some friendly energy around. No pressure, no networking awkwardness, just coworking together IRL.

We’re organizing these through a new platform called Drop In, it’s free and built specifically for coworking meetups. You can RSVP without an account, see live schedules, and chat with others attending.

There are already a couple of Drop Ins happening here in Bangkok this week, would love to see more people join in or even host your own session!

1oljzxg,https://i.redd.it/p13qacw5cmyf1.png,AIO to the guy I'm dating doing this on my birthday?,"(yes it's a very long but juicy tea, yes there's a TLDR, and no it could not have been more winnowed down)

SOOOOOO I'm 21F, i met this guy on hinge. He has looking for a long term relationship in his profile. We switched to Instagram and i got overwhelmed with dating apps and wasn't exactly talking to anyone but this guy kept pursuing me. I thought fine, if he's so persistent he must be really into me and he looks decent and has a nice vibe too so why not give it a try? So after like a month or so of exchanging Instagrams, we finally actually start talking (early aug). We have an insane vibe match, great flirting and we soon go on a first date. The date goes great. A lot of exploring the city, laughing, flirting, he's making me blush, I'm making him blush, awesome banter etc. He kept clicking my pictures and calling me pretty and I'm like wow he's a genuinely nice guy. My friends disapproved of him btw, said he doesn't look good and ""I can't be seen outside with him""😭 But he is very very chalant which i loved and was a jacked nerd which is exactly my type.

Now, i don't let that stop me and go on a second date.  We went to mkt and while we're having a good time, two of my college classmates pop up at the table next to us while that guy and me we're kinda cozy and they spot me and say my name out loud. It was SOO EMBARASSING because they did not know that i had broken up with my ex 3 months ago since we had a vacation before the semester started and we obviously weren't in contact. THEY THOUGHT I WAS CHEATING 😭😭 and I had to explain to them that I've broken up with my ex and that I'll speak to them later. We rush out of that restaurant and go elsewhere and had dessert there. We ended up having a deep conversation about what we look for in a partner, what were our deal breakers etc. It was going great so far. We pay the bill and step out and towards the door, i see my ex bestfriend.🤡

I hold the guys hand and sprint us out of the bakery. We now decided to head to the mall and while going to the metro station, his colleague comes up to him. ATP I WAS SURE THE NEXT PERSON I SEE IS GOING TO BE A RELATIVE. lol. Now we head to the mall and he tries to kiss me in the metro elevator. I PULLED AWAY. Because why would someone try to kiss you for the first time in a metro elevator that opens in 10 seconds??? It got a little awkward after that but the awkwardness faded out after like 15-20 minutes. We ended the date by getting coffee and talking some more and listening to music with wired earphones. It was cute. I was happy. By now, we've talked about what we're looking for, what we look for in a partner and things like that.

I told him I'm not into casuals and he said he wasn't looking for one either. 
Now we're talking on hour long calls, texting everyday, giving mundane life updates everyday, i started liking all of this.
Then came the third date. He lives with his flatmates in the outskirts (ncr) because of his job so he invited me home and we had built up enough chemisty for me to say yes now. Rare occasion. I go to his place, i took flowers for him and his reaction to that was ""come on, now i feel bad"". he cooks me food, we watch a show, do stuff (just up until second base, he asked for more and i declined) listen to music and we had a lot of fun. He drops me at the metro station and I get back home. 

We have now entered october. 
Now comes dussehra and he goes to his hometown for that. Things are busy and we aren't able to plan another date because the first weekend he's at home, second weekend he has plans, third weekend was diwali. and also my 21st birthday (18th oct) he had a train on my birthday and i decided to celebrate by throwing a girl's sleepover on 17th night because there was another festival on the 18th. 

We had this thing where we like diabolical reels on ig and then reply to each other's likes in a banter. He had liked a reel that said ""when I'm about to lock in but then i remember who's ovulating"" and i replied to that with the eyes emoji. we have a conversation over it and i say ""i wonder if that was for me tho"" and that mf proceeds to say ""valid doubt🤣"" and i get so pissed. I don't do casuals and he knew that. I said don't waste my time if that's the case and he says ""if what's the case???"" Now i was PISSED. I held onto my cool and calmly said ""if you've got a roster, go play but out of my dms"" to which he very casually says ""to think I'd have the time to maintain a roster😭"" and i was like "" i don't have one reason to believe that"" and that mf goes ""i can say the same about you"" LIKE?!?! i ask him ""literally how???"" he ignores the question and the conversation takes another route. 

Now it's around 10 pm on 17th and my friends have come, we're getting ready and I'm not on my phone. Around 12:15, he comes up and wishes me ""Happy birthday babygirl i hope you're having fun"" no emojis, no extra letters, i felt bad but i still thanked him as soon as i saw that text. He had started telling me whenever he had plans so i assumed he didn't have any tonight since he has a train to catch tomorrow morning but boy was i wrong. 


It's now 5 am, I'm absolutely down in the dumps drunk, we proceed to the kitchen to make maggi where i pick up my phone to make a snap vlog for memories and i see he has uploaded a story on snap, which has never happened so far and my first thought was that it must've been an accident cuz it has happened to me a lot. I open the story and it's some club, the camera rotates and he's there at a diwali party in a kurta with a dupatta around his neck, two girls are standing next to him, he turns his head and kisses the girl. Now mind you i was absolutely trashed here. I screenrecorded that story, removed him from my snap and my private account and text him on whatsapp. one single word. ""asshole."" he doesn't reply, OBVIOUSLY, he had no defence.

 Later that day, around 8 pm i post my birthday pictures on my main account and as you would've guessed, i get a text back (the screenshot) I never replied to that text. Bro wasn't sorry that he kissed the girl, his only regret was me seeing it so now he couldn't play me anymore.


His ego gets hurt since I'm not writing long ass paragraphs asking for answers and he puts up a reel on his story that says ""the lion doesn't drink so he doesn't remember, the lion drinks so everyone remembers"" it pissed me off and posted a story on that audio ""whatever makes you feel better"" with the caption ""whatever makes you feel manly🥰"" i knew i got his ego. 

This man beat all levels of petty. He then proceeded to post a story with the girl he had kissed in the video and hid her face with a song OFC. But me being the silly little detective that i am, found that girl in his following and also found her private acc so he definitely didn't just meet her in the club. I got so confused thinking if i should text the girl warning her because what if she was his girlfriend and he cheated on her with me?? But then that girl didn't repost his story so i thought maybe not lol. Anyways, why are men like this?? I straight up asked him if he was seeing other people and he dodged it and proceeded to give me the best birthday gift possible. GOOD RIDDANCE. 





TLDR;

I (21F) was pursued by a persistent guy I met on Hinge who was looking for a long term relationship. Despite my friends' disapproval of his looks, i went out with him because our vibe really matched. This is early aug. 

Went on three dates. The first was amazing. Second was great as well but got a little awkward cuz he tried to kiss me in a metro elevator and i pulled away. the date ended up being cute regardless. The third one was at his place and things got a little heated (didn't go far from second base). 

After this, we started talking on long calls, updating each other about mundane things, video calls, texting all the time etc.

We've now entered oct. Since there were so many festivals, we both had busy schedules and couldn't plan a fourth date.
My birthday was on the 18th. On 17th, things got a little tense when I asked him if he was seeing other people and he deflected the question saying he doesn't have the time to maintain a roster. I had a girls sleepover planned on 17th night so I wasn't texting back much because I was busy attendinh my friends. 

Later that night he sent a dry ass birthday wish saying ""happy birthday babygirl i hope ur having fun"" with no emojis or extra letters but i let it slide. I wasn't aware of any of his plans and he had a train to catch in the morning. I got very drunk that night. I saw his snap story at 5 am. The story was of a club where he kissed a girl standing next to him. It was obviously uploaded accidentally. Then i removed him from my snap and priv account and then sent the text in the screenshot (his reply was after i posted my birthday pictures 18th evening)

He beat all levels of petty and posted a story that said ""the lion doesn't drink so he doesn't remember, the lion drinks so everyone remembers"" it pissed me off and posted a story on that audio ""whatever makes you feel better"" with the caption ""whatever makes you feel manly🥰"" i knew i got his ego. 

He then proceeded to post a story with the girl he had kissed in the video and hid her face with a song OFC. I found the girl's account and thought of texting her cuz what if he was her boyfriend and cheated on her with me but she didn't repost that story so i let it go.

The first time we met, I accidentally broke a porcelain doll she'd just bought. It led to apologies, coffees and later into late night calls and dates.

One thing I learnt in the five years we've been together is that, she loves dolls, maybe a tad bit too much.

The problem, per se, started after the birth of our daughter. The pregnancy was really hard for Laura, especially the weight gain.

She was so obsessed with having the perfect body that the pregnancy changes in her body almost had her going crazy.

So it wasn't surprising when Laura started going to the gym very soon after her delivery.

I don't know how but she did lose a lot of weight in a couple of months. She became almost all skin and bones, a doll like body, she called it.

_______________________________________

""I want to be a doll"", Laura said one night.

I thought she was joking.

But Laura became obsessed with doll like features. 

The perfect hourglass body, pointy chin, small full lips.

One day, she left a note saying that she'd be back and just vanished.

No replies to calls, texts, nothing.

Four days later, she came back with her whole face bandaged.

""Where the fuck were you?"", I screeched, holding our daughter in my hands.

""Pennsylvania. There was a surgeon there who said he'd help me""

And help her he did. When Laura finally decided to let me see her face,  she really did look like a doll. But it felt wrong, very wrong.

Things were getting somewhat back to normal or as normal as it could get I guess.
__________________________________________

It was a Tuesday night that I first noticed the stitches. 

Around the wrist of Laura's left hand was perfectly placed stitches. I actually thought it was a tattoo at first, but the texture once I touched it confirmed that it was real stitches.

This was getting even creepier. What the actual hell was she doing to her body?

I wanted to talk to her about it the next morning but she began to actively avoid me to such an extent that I had to hire a babysitter for our baby.

Laura would go out before I woke up with a note saying 'out on a jog' and she'd not be back even after I returned from work. I wasn't even sure if she came back during some days.

I finally saw her after 17 days. She was in the nursery, holding our baby in her arms and looking out the window.

She was wearing a long sleeved turtle neck but I could see a hint of stitches sticking out at the top around her neck.

""I'm really really happy. Do you want to be happy?"", her voice was odd, hollow.

""I'm happy as long as I'm with you both"", I would hear the quiver in my voice.

She turned to face me fully then. She still had the odd doll like features, but her eyes.. they were different. It was almost all black, no part of her iris to be seen.

""Let's all be happy together, me, you and our sweet girl"", the smile she gave me then was sure to give me nightmares for years to come.

The corner of her lips stretched wider, her teeth looked stained with something black. The teeth didn't look human.

She slowly walked towards me and gave me the baby.

""I'll be waiting for you in the bedroom"", she gave me the same smile again.

I just nodded, clutching my baby close.

I watched as she entered our bedroom, as soon as she was out of my sight, I bolted down the stairs.

I hurriedly opened the door and got in the car, baby still in my arms.

Laura watched through our bedroom window as I backed out of the driveway, that smile streching her face wider.

I've been living in a hotel for a week now. 

I wish this would've ended with Laura, but when I was changing my daughter's diaper today, I noticed a stitch in the crease of her ankle. Same as the one Laura had.

Since i spend my time alone and i dont have friends i had changed my mind the same day and told her that since spending my time alone is super boring we could go out for a coffee but she didnt answer that message, she only read it. 24 hours had passed and i told her sorry if i said anything wrong and that i am anxious abd he told me that i didnt do anything wrong and that she understands that i am anxious. 1 month approximately after, i sent the translated message which will be in the end of the text.

I told Emily, “I don’t know.”
I’m not really sure why, but in person I don’t talk the same way I do here. I think I mentioned to you about a month ago that I might have a mild form of autism — maybe that explains it a bit.
Anyway, I just want to say that I actually messaged Anna Carter to go out, in case she was the one who wanted to meet.
Would you like to go out for a coffee, whether she accepts or not? Even though I get anxious, I’d still like to go if you want. I think I get nervous because I’ve never gone out with a woman before.
I know it’s been about a month since I last texted you, but lately I’ve started to feel like going out again (I haven’t really hung out with my friends for about three years).
I’m not sure, if you do want to go out and you don’t have other obligations, whether we’ll go out again after that — I just want to try it and see how it feels. With my friends, I eventually stopped because I didn’t feel fulfilled as a person, maybe because I spend too much time online and I’m trying to cut back.
Still, I’d really like to give it a try and see how it goes."" 
So should i text her now and try for a last time because loneliness is killing me and i think that she is a good person that is at least what i am seeing when i work with her. Thanks in advance if anyone is going to reply.",1,1761990777.0,AskOldPeopleAdvice,0,1.0,False

Yaaay, I finally completed my 20 day (and some hours) waterfast!! I started this fast with two main goals: (1) weightloss (2) reframe my relationship with food/ eating and (3) to kickstart my health and fitness journey. And I am very happy that I managed to achieve all three!

Over the past three years, I slowly gained weight, mainly due to being a stress eater, binge sessions and simply loving food. I found comfort in it and with my mental health dipping at times, never had the courage to step up for myself and my health. I finally decided it was enough this summer and came down from my highest (75+kg, to be honest I did not weigh myself because I didn't want to know, but at 5'4 (165cm) I was definitely above normal range) to the starting weight of my fast: 73,3kg (161.6 lbs). I am familiar with fasting, especially multi day fasts so I knew the drill. However, this fast (as all of them do) suprised even me again. 

First and foremost, for electrolytes I stuck to what has always worked for me: 1500mg potassium, 400mg magnesium, a bit of salt on a teaspoon, some multivitamins. It's just what I have always used/ adapted to fit my needs. It didn't happen this time but if I ever truly felt horrible, I would just take more salt - which usually solved all my problems. I drank the following: water, lot's of tea, mainly jasmin and earl grey, a bit of black coffee (usually americano), 1x diet soda (not big on the taste of sodas, but it was a social situation) and water with a bit of lemon. I made sure to always drink at least 2litres of water independent of other liquids consumed, which i tracked by emptying my beloved waterbottle 2+ times each day. 

I did not exercise this fast, except for light walks and my typical moving around. I would say I usually burned between 100-500 kcal through exercise though it was mostly on the lower side. I do that because I tried in previous fasts to keep up strength/ endurance training but it just makes me so exhausted I am basically useless the whole rest of the day. So I simply didn't do it this time. Gotta say though - I developed an avid hatred for buildings without elevators this fast. STAIRS. My god. 

Now, I am not one of these people who get this super duper mental clarity and energy (god, i wish!) but my energy levels were extremely stable, especially towards the last 10 days. My sleep was wild, sometimes I slept normally, sometimes I didn't sleep at all. Since I incorporated more coffee than usual, I will blame it on that one. Regardless of sleep, my energy levels were almost always good so I just... didn't care that much. I offered my body sleep, magnesium and other stuff and if it took me up on the offer, I slept. If not, well nice to get some more reading time in. No reason to panic - worked out pretty well for me. I do have to say, in the last week my sleep schedule was almost completely normal, though a bit shorter than I am used to. 

Also, I did not prepare for this fast with Keto or anything (which I usually would have done but I kinda... was to lazy.) I have to say, the cravings this fast, especially the mental ones were extremely light. So light I was suprised by it the whole first 10 days. Like, the body stops wanting food after 3 days and it's all a mental game for me afterwards but this time it was just... easy? Not sure what happened there but I was really happy about it. Sure, they weren't completely gone and I did watch some food videos (Eric the Electric anyone? Mukbangs? Cooking videos? I can't be the only one...) but these mental cravings were gone so quickly, I couldn't even believe it. 

In any case, here is a breakdown of the three weeks: 

Week 1: First three days I was really lazy. Day 4 I was super energetic and productive, but also couldn't sleep at night. 5 and 6 were miserable, has headdaches and bad sleep. Did a lot of reflection though, 7 was normal and productive, though still sluggish. This was the only week in which I had mental cravings, mainly on 5+6.

Week 2: Day 8-10 sleep finally got better and I was very productive. 11 was normal and 12 completely miserable. I think my bloodsugar tanked from a combination of factors and I was very close to breaking the fast. It got better after a few hours though so I continued. 13-14 were easy. Energy levels had completely stabilised. I knew all the bumps were over and it was only a time game from now on. 

Week 3: completely constant energy levels. Sleep normal though short. Walked a bit, very productive. Chewed a bunch of gum but mainly out of boredom. Waiting game. 

And today, on the 1st of November, 20 days later, I am finally here. I broke my fast with absolutely DELICIOUS home cooked bone broth and am currently waiting to give my body time to wake up again. My refeed plan is built around two goals: (1) maximise gut health (2) stay in a keto diet. This was only the kickstart to my weightloss journey and I am happy to have gotten such a good one. From now on, I will transition into a deficit, add back exercise to build muscle (I really missed that one!) and create habits that last. I did a lot of reflection during my fast to get to the core of my problem (and why I let myself gain weight) and I believe that to be the best thing I achieved in these 20 days: I changed my mindset. 

I realised I love myself, always have, always will and that I truly want the best for me. My body and me are a team, we are one, and I will no longer disrespect myself by forcing junk down my throat. Food is not a reward - because I am not a dog. Food is fuel, energy to be used to strive towards something. Sure, it tastes good, but is it worth my health? I think the most important realisation I had was around day 10 when I realised I was contemplating all the great foods I would eat after my fast. And then I caught myself - why would I destroy all that hard work? Why would I try to harm my own progress like that? So I reframed the way I saw food entirely. And... I think it worked. Even now, after having eaten a bit, I don't want anymore of it. I don't want the sweets. I don't want the sugar. I want healthy food to fuel myself but nothing more. 

I think I could have gone longer easily with this fast, but I believe 20 days are a nice round number to end it one. It's time to move onto the next phase of my weightloss journey and I am excited to see where it is taking me. To whoever bothered to read this: don't give up. You got this and you are stronger than you believe. Get over the hard part and the rest will take care of itself. I mean, time is going to pass anyways - might as well do something while it does. :)

I recently decided to try the Turbomoka from Italy. Intrigued by its claims of rapid brewing, I was in need of a new moka pot, and this one seemed perfect for my hectic schedule. I often find myself rushing and craving a quick espresso, so the idea of a faster brewing time caught my attention.

After nearly 2.5 months of back-and-forth with the company (which I'll get into later), I finally received the Turbomoka and to my surprise, it lived up to its promises. I honestly wasn’t expecting it to be much faster than my trusty Bialetti moka pot, but it actually brews coffee about 40% quicker. To test this, I placed both pots side by side on the same heat setting on my gas stove, running the experiment a few times over the next few days. The results were consistent.

That said, if you're not specifically looking for a faster brewing time to save a few minutes here and there, I’d say it’s not essential. As I mentioned earlier, it took a long time to arrive, and when it finally did, I was hit with an unexpected $56 shipping fee to collect the package despite the fact that they advertise free shipping at checkout (I'm in the US). The only mention of duties or fees is buried in their shipping policy page, where it’s simply stated that you ""might be subject to duties and fees,"". Had I known it'd be an additional 50% of the cost of the item, I would definitely think otherwise about purchasing. ",1,1761989946.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

So, this is where the handshake brought a twist to the story.

After the coffee, we departed, and once I reached home, she pinged me to ask if I reached safely. Nice gesture, I thought. But what followed next surprised me she continued texting for the next two days, straight. That’s when I felt like she was getting too interested. Her compliments, her tone everything hinted she was developing feelings

Honestly I didn’t feel anything more than friendship. I just thought she was a kind soul. But then came the big twist she asked me if I had a girlfriend. I said no. And that’s when she started flirting.

I handled it smoothly because I was always crystal clear I don’t lye with her. Flirting is fine, sure, but not more than that 😂

She noticed something I took everything casually and never judged her. I’ve heard much wilder stories before, so when she started sharing her dark stuff, about her boyfriend and her husband, it didn’t shock me. Honestly, I just nodded and listened. Sometimes people don’t need advice  just someone to hear them out. So that’s what I did.

I’ve always believed when someone vents you listen. And then you let it go from the other ear. No point holding on to things that doesn't matter to you.So even though she shared things that were none of my business, I didn’t entertain it emotionally.

But here’s the thing sometimes, when you give someone that safe space, they misuse it. She openly accepted she was physically attracted and that with age (she was 39) things in her married life weren’t the same… so she tried to provoke me into it. Tempting trap Maybe. But I wasn’t interested in ruining my peace.

When you lean towards spirituality, you see these situations clearly. If I was someone else, I might have fallen for it and regretted it forever.

When I confronted her that I’m not looking for that, she brushed it off said she was just kidding. Maybe. Maybe not. Things were normal but we used to text more rather than calls. 

Then one day, her daughter caught her with my texts nothing wild just a simple hello.She denied knowing me to avoid any drama. From that point, she became more careful. We stopped texting like before. She would still flirt sometimes and then say she was just joking.

We met once more for coffee. This time she brought chocolate for me which I politely declined because I don’t eat that. This is how she slowly opened up her feelings. Maybe feelings is not the perfect word but you get the idea 😂

She wanted to go for a coffee with me, she suggested it to me while she had a boyfriend that she didnt go well with him(she has broken up i am almost sure) and i told her since she has a bf i dont think it is right to go out for a coffee with her. Since i spend my time alone and i dont have friends i had changed my mind the same day and told her that since spending my time alone is super boring we could go out for a coffee but she didnt answer that message, she only read it. 24 hours had passed and i told her sorry if i said anything wrong and that i am anxious abd he told me that i didnt do anything wrong and that she understands that i am anxious. 1 month approximately after, i sent the translated message which will be in the end of the text. She onky read the message but in my job (we are coworkers) she wants me to talk to her as far as i understand. Forbexample  i asked a coworker just for fun who is a girl if she wants me to make her a gift since she was gonna stop working there and Sophie told me that she wants a gift drom me and also there are more things that i could say. So people should i send her again a message asking her if she wantsnto go out with me? She seems a good person but of course i dont know if she really is. Maybe i misplayed since the message that i am gonna send now might be a misplay as i said by me. ""To be honest, Sophie, Emily told me that Anna wanted me to go for a coffee with her. I told Emily, “I don’t know.”
I’m not really sure why, but in person I don’t talk the same way I do here. I think I mentioned to you about a month ago that I might have a mild form of autism — maybe that explains it a bit.
Anyway, I just want to say that I actually messaged Anna Carter to go out, in case she was the one who wanted to meet.
Would you like to go out for a coffee, whether she accepts or not? Even though I get anxious, I’d still like to go if you want. I think I get nervous because I’ve never gone out with a woman before.
I know it’s been about a month since I last texted you, but lately I’ve started to feel like going out again (I haven’t really hung out with my friends for about three years).
I’m not sure, if you do want to go out and you don’t have other obligations, whether we’ll go out again after that — I just want to try it and see how it feels. With my friends, I eventually stopped because I didn’t feel fulfilled as a person, maybe because I spend too much time online and I’m trying to cut back.
Still, I’d really like to give it a try and see how it goes."" 
So should i text her now and try for a last time because loneliness is killing me and i think that she is a good person that is at least what i am seeing when i work with her. Thanks, in advance if anyone will reply.",1,1761989738.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I've been lurking on this sub for a while, soaking up all the inspiring stories about people building cool stuff with AI. Finally decided to share mine, even though it's super basic compared to some of the wild projects here. About six months ago, I launched my first AI tool called LegitScanAI, it's a simple web app that scans contracts, terms of service, and legal docs to summarize the key bits and flag any sketchy clauses you know like those sneaky ""we can change prices anytime"" lines. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's my baby, and I thought I'd ramble a bit about how it came to be.

**Why I started this (spoiler: laziness and a bad habit)**  
Look, I'm no developer wizard I work a day job in marketing and just tinker with code on weekends. But like a lot of us, I have this terrible habit of clicking ""I Agree"" on every terms and conditions pop-up without a second thought. You know the drill: ""Sure, whatever, just let me in."" Then one day, I signed up for this freelance gig platform, and buried in the ToS was this gem allowing them to withhold payments if they ""deemed"" my work subpar – no appeals, no details. I got dinged for $200 on a project that was fine, and it hit me: How many of us are agreeing to stuff we don't even skim? Stats say like 97% of people don't read ToS (I think I saw that on a blog somewhere), but we're all legally bound by it. Frustrating, right? I figured, what if there was a quick way to at least get the highlights and spot the red flags without needing a law degree?

That sparked the idea. No grand vision of disrupting Big Law or anything just a tool to save folks like me from our own impulsiveness. I wanted it humble: upload a doc, get a plain-English summary, hover over a flagged term to see the exact spot in the file, and even keep a history of what you've scanned before. Pro tip: It always starts fresh each time no creepy data carryover.   
  
**The journey (the messy, fun parts)**  
I started with zero AI experience beyond messing around with ChatGPT prompts. Used base44 (shoutout to their no-code vibes) to prototype the core – text extraction from PDFs (had to hack in some OCR for scanned junk), feeding it to an AI model for analysis, and slapping on that hover preview thing because scrolling through 20 page contracts is the worst. Hit so many walls Files wouldn't upload right, responses came back unstructured, and I spent a weekend debugging why it thought ""force majeure"" was a suspicious fee (spoiler: context matters). Budget? Laughable – under $200 total, mostly on coffee and a cheap domain.

Launched quietly in August, shared it with a few Reddit threads and my LinkedIn circle. Got maybe 40 signups in the first month, mostly freelancers and small biz owners griping about vendor contracts. Feedback's been gold: One user said it caught a data-sharing clause in a SaaS trial that saved them a headache. Another just laughed at how it roasted their gym membership fine print. It's free for basic scans (up to 3/month), with cheap tiers if you need more but honestly, that's secondary. The real win is hearing ""I actually read the whole thing this time.""

If you're building something similar or just want to chat about newbie pitfalls, hit me up. Or if you've got ToS horror stories. What's the dumbest clause you've blindly agreed to?

I apologise in advance if some details feel like a kid doing these things but I was hurt, confused, extremely sad. This is post about relationship, friendship, ends. I have tried to get response at other places but I didn't get any and I want to understand what's happening 

I met a girl through mutuals beginning of this year and dated for a short period a while back. I fell in love with her but she didn't. She said she couldn't see a future with me and ended things. She said we could stay in touch as friends so I did that. I ended up hurting her 1-2 times during this friendship initially and things got tough but we started talking again as friends. It's been 4.5 months since we broke up. Earlier when we were dating there were 2-3 times when we had a fight and i would react on text message and she would find that extremely rude. From my perspective i wasn't trying to be rude but it always seemed that way to her that my tone is rude.


I would tell one part of our conversations which will be relevant:

We had decided to be open about our past. In these when we were dating and had a fight. We were talking about past crushes relationship and I once told her how maybe she hid about this one guy who she was maybe in a relationship with. I had checked her instagram profile, old posts and comments and one guys comments and her replies made me feel like they were more than friends. When I asked her about it, I felt her reaction was different but she said she was surprised because he's just a good childhood friend. She didn't say how close they were. Once when I saw his name on her screen on Instagram while sharing a reel on top, she said they exchange a lot of reels. I thought okay they are good friends share reels, that's okay. (I'm telling this and about him because I think I should)


After we ended things she said we could be friends, so I tried to stay friends even though  I have strong feelings towards her. We initially had many problems even stopped talking once but got back to talking again. For the last month things were going good, we used to meet up for coffee as friends as well. Last weekend, few days ago, i saw her with a friend. She did introduce me to him before i left. I knew who he was. What I saw that he has the exact same two tattoos on his hand as she does. They are just on opposite hands but at the same placement.  One of the tattoos is a symbol of sun and other is the word ""constant"". These are old tattoos. One is 6 years old and other her 3.5. She had told me how she doesn't get any random tattoos and tattoos have meaning to them for her. She only gets tattoo which she connects to. I saw the guy's tattoo and my heart sank. When we were dating i had been open about everything specially the past because that's what we had decided. She hid this big fact from me. For the two days that he was here in this city (maybe 2, idk if more. He lives in a different city), i saw her instagram stories of being in a cafe and restaurant. For the first time i didn't react anything to her photos.  She looked extremely happy, a different kind of happy. I was extremely  sad thinking they are in a relationship (which idk). Her last story which she uploaded around 12-12.30am was collage of video clips of her selfie and she looked extremely happy and glowing. And around 1.30 am when I opened her profile i saw that i cant her story or highlights anymore which meant she hid me from her stories. I know i was kinda stalking checking her profile again and again on insta for the last 2days.. i was very anxious and sad..I impulsively texted her ""thank you for moving me to the hidden list of your stories. "" she sent two emojis and said excuses me as saying she didn't do it. I checked multiple times and i couldn't  see her highlights as well. She told me why would she do it. She has nothing to HIDE from me. I told her this and also said ""Don't lie to me atleast. I just want you to be honest"". She once again said the same thing. And said she found my tone extremely  rude. She said this happened 1-2 times in the past as well, the way i react. It's rude She doesn't allow such a tone. I said I agree the first msg was rude and ended up confessing how i still like her a lot and this makes confused and torn apart between my mind and heart as I know nothing could ever happen. and idk what i say. She replied that i need to get out of this ASAP as she has already done it. She removed me from insta and ended the friendship as well.


And then her last message ""we met through mutuals. I thought we can be good friends. But you're totally something else"". These lines. These hurt the most. As if she now thinks I'm crazy. I knew it was gonna, most probably, but still had that lingering hope. But to end like this? Like where she thinks I am a completely different person, this doesn't sit right, it makes me feel really bad and i just want to tell her how I saw the tattoos and why reacted the way I did even when I know this wouldn't change things between us. I want her to know what I saw and not think I'm crazy. 

I don't know what I should do and I am very confused. I don't want to hurt her, I don't know what she will think. I want to text her apologise for my behaviour and tell her how I felt when I saw them. I  haven't told her tell that I saw those tattoos. That how hurt i am that she hid such a big thing from me when we were dating. I don't know if there's anything I can do. I knew it had to end, I had planned a better end by writing a letter. But I messed it all up..I really don't know what to do anymore and it's making me suffocate.

I have written one last message to explain things. But idk if I should send it or not. I can't think straight right now ",1,1761989273.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I was down for not serious cus I was kinda getting over a rejection where I had the rug pulled out from under me.

We hung out, hooked up, talked a lot and really opened up to each other, hooked up again and then I went home even when he offered I should stay over.

We texted a lot after that and I could see we aligned a lot in interests, sense of humour, life values, how much we value our work. I tried to distance myself from the text messaging but he was really enthusiastic and I didn't want to make him feel like I wasn't enjoying it.

We hung out a second time, went back to his place and he made me dinner, we had some pretty vulnerable sex where he tried a kink he's never tried before with anyone and I was like sure I'm game why not and we just laid on his bedroom floor afterwards talking about our experiences growing up from repressed households and how we did a lot of our sexual exploration later in life.

This time instead of offering for me to stay over he actually said ""You don't have to stay over, but I'd really like it if you did"", so I broke my own rule and I did. Normally I'd just leave the morning after soon as I get up, but he insisted on making me breakfast and then coffee, and then we're sitting on his couch chatting and listening to music before we end up having slow late morning sex.

When I eventually leave I kinda have an Oh shit moment. I tell myself I should end this soon cus I could feel myself getting attached and he probably doesn't feel the same at all -- I figured he's just acting the way he is cus he's new to casual dating and probs doesn't know how to not act like a boyfriend.

I told myself I'd give him one more date and then I'd end things myself.

Funny enough when I asked him if he was keen to keep seeing each other.......he called me and admitted that he was starting to see me as someone he could be with long term but he wasn't in the headspace for it, and even though he actually wanted to have more dates with me, he thought it was best that we stopped seeing each other. He said he felt at peace and stable with me and he found himself uncomfortable with that and that he really needs to unpack that.

I asked him if we could keep dating and see where things go without any pressure on him while he sorts himself out from his breakup? And he said no, he could only date me when it was fun and lighthearted......and as soon as he saw me as someone he could be with long term, it stopped being light hearted for him. He also knew I was putting a pause on dating for a relationship and he said he wanted me to find a relationship that was fulfilling and long term, cus I was ready for it, and to not wait around for him.

I thanked him for being honest, wished him all the best and told him he can message me whenever, but I won't be waiting. He said he reckons we'll run into each other again and then we hung up. 

All in all it's the most positive end to a connection I've had. It's been a month and I never reached out. I don't think he will either and I'm not holding out. This thread isn't me asking like ""will be come back lol"" cus I'm not holding out for him. I guess I'm just looking for people who have been in this guy's shoes.

""Found"" is in quotes because I believe different setups will work for different people AND because I believe most of the progress for me came from constantly re-trying and building habits over time

What works for me:

\- Utility smartphone (a.k.a. dumbed down smartphone, which for me means NO browser, NO app store after installing core apps, most apps except distracting apps like social media)

\- sweat every morning to activate my heart & brain, then (naturally) set ONE intention for the day

\- find other things to do (walking, people watching in a coffee shop, running a business, reading, gym, swimming, instrument, ... list is endless but key is it's one immersive activity you enjoy and it does not have to be the same all the time)

\- dedicated place for work on the computer, the nice setup helps to get productive instead of procrastination

\- app / website blocker until afternoon (i use heyfocus on mac)

\- also block work apps etc 1-2 hours before i usually go to bed

\- have a 'quick' method to stash away thoughts, could be a notebook you carry, your notes / reminders app or (my favorite) a Raycast extension on MacOS where i can push distractions into my Todoist without seeing the list of open things

\- a scheduled time to re-visit your list of distractions, for me that's every friday, when you can decide if you want to move on with a thought (for me usually 90-100% become totally obsolete, and it happened so often that nowadays i have no issue with not even taking notes on some things, especially because the most important things start haunting me after a while anyways)

\- AI Research assistant to speed up some of the research and to summarize things like YT videos (make sure to always fact-check important info!)

\- extensions for web browsers: feed blocker, ad blocker, comment hider, social focus (can do things like hide certain features or turn everything grayscale)

There are also a million other things I adopted that I don't really think about on a day to day, like f.e. not bringing my phone to the gym or not listening to music on all my runs - things that also generally improve my input / output ratio.

Key thing for me was: Design your environment to make good choices easy, bad choices hard and start being creative or productive and re-try over and over and trust the process.

you will find way better things to fill your time with. there comes a point where you can sort of see behind the facade of most things - YT, IG, X feed is full of desperate people who want to suck out money from you and I can't describe it any other way but when you're out of that system for a while you just see the grift no matter if someone wants to suck away your attention or straight up sells you a scam.

And please don't be mad if you screw up, it happens (even happens to me sometimes) but I can laugh about it and have cues, triggers and reminders everywhere that bring me back to my best practices constantly - these are not annoying notifications, but rather naturally joyful things like my barking dog, pre-scheduled practice classes, messages from friends who like to go out vs. texting / online BS, my desk setup etc.

I can even enjoy the times I am conciously consuming media or surf around and it all became way more purposeful.

She now has dementia and my brother has taken over her finances from her lawyer brother.

This has been horribly mismanaged. Rent didn't increase in 15 years and it's so far behind market value that we have no option but to sell for her ongoing care, a real shame.

The deposit wasn't put in the deposit scheme when it should have been when the law came in... (This I can handle, deposit was only £600 and I'm fine paying them the maximum a tribunal would should they go that route)

They have every incentive to remain as long as possible, it is the cheapest 2 bedroom in town and in a very desirable area.

My brother is ""handling"" moving forward with the sale but it's very slow.

Anyhow.. my main question. .

The tenant is now aware but hasn't responded to emails sent, I saw them when they came for a spare key and when they returned it. When I pressed them if they'd responded they said ""yes, I've been meaning to speak to (mother), we'll arrange a meetup""

My mother is technically the landlord but my brother has power of attorney. Mums memory is gone, understands little. How to ring fence her from the tenant? I can't have the tenant badgering a vulnerable person and getting verbal agreements to stay for longer.. the flat should have already been sold by now and it's getting frustrating. I need to streamline things and there's no way they should be bargaining with a dementia sufferer.

Many thanks, I'm only one coffee deep and am a full time carer the last two years till the flat is sold. Knackered.

Almost one week since I fully surrendered to this  25 year habit. 

First four days were horrendous. For me, having cut out weed and alcohol already it was my last remaining way to regulate emotions. A 25 year habit that was one of many addictions that stripped away anything good that I had built. During day 1-4 the weight of shame and regret sat on me like a physical weight on my chest. It remains albeit a bit lighter today.

Today I feel more energy than yesterday. Almost as if I woke up feeling the effects of having had my coffee before even drinking it.

Spiritually and emotionally I am exhausted. The difference is that today I have the energy and clarity of thoughts returning to be able to take action to improve in these areas one day at a time. 

The past still haunts me. I live there. I pushed away an incredible girl who saw me for the addict I was yet gave everything to try and save me. I gave away my business as I descended into full blown alcoholic drinking and quite possibly manifested the paranoia that built up in my head into reality. It's complicated and the search for truth blindsided me from the most fundamental truth of all. I am a spiritually and emotionally bankrupt addict who became totally reliant on cheap dopamine hits over long term goals and real connection. 

Urges crept in this morning. One minute I'm on Instagram and see a borderline nsfw post. I feel the whirring sensation in my brain as old connections start to rewire encouraging me into old lust traps. I go on to redownload tinder for the 474858282 time, start swiping and more brain whirring occurs. 

This time I didn't fall into old habits. I haven't come this far to lose. Tinder is deleted and I'm off out for a walk.

Since i spend my time alone and i dont have friends i had changed my mind the same day and told her that since spending my time alone is super boring we could go out for a coffee but she didnt answer that message, she only read it. 24 hours had passed and i told her sorry if i said anything wrong and that i am anxious abd he told me that i didnt do anything wrong and that she understands that i am anxious. 1 month approximately after, i sent the translated message which will be in the end of the text. She onky read the message but in my job (we are coworkers) she wants me to talk to her as far as i understand. Forbexample  i asked a coworker just for fun who is a girl if she wants me to make her a gift since she was gonna stop working there and Sophie told me that she wants a gift drom me and also there are more things that i could say. So people should i send her again a message asking her if she wantsnto go out with me? She seems a good person but of course i dont know if she really is. Maybe i misplayed since the message that i am gonna send now might be a misplay as i said by me. ""To be honest, Sophie, Emily told me that Anna wanted me to go for a coffee with her. I told Emily, “I don’t know.”
I’m not really sure why, but in person I don’t talk the same way I do here. I think I mentioned to you about a month ago that I might have a mild form of autism — maybe that explains it a bit.
Anyway, I just want to say that I actually messaged Anna Carter to go out, in case she was the one who wanted to meet.
Would you like to go out for a coffee, whether she accepts or not? Even though I get anxious, I’d still like to go if you want. I think I get nervous because I’ve never gone out with a woman before.
I know it’s been about a month since I last texted you, but lately I’ve started to feel like going out again (I haven’t really hung out with my friends for about three years).
I’m not sure, if you do want to go out and you don’t have other obligations, whether we’ll go out again after that — I just want to try it and see how it feels. With my friends, I eventually stopped because I didn’t feel fulfilled as a person, maybe because I spend too much time online and I’m trying to cut back.
Still, I’d really like to give it a try and see how it goes."" 
So should i text her now and try for a last time because loneliness is killing me and i think that she is a good person that is at least what i am seeing her when i work with her.",1,1761988024.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

I’m not entirely sure why, but I think it might be due to stress. For some context, I recently moved back home after graduating college. My college was about 5 hours away in a really nice city. Since moving back, I’ve found myself really missing things like the local shops, coffee spots, and just driving around there.

Because of that, I’ve been thinking about taking a solo weekend trip back to that city. I’d drive there (it’s about a 5-hour drive), stay one night in a hotel, and then head back the next evening. I do have friends there I could stay with, but honestly, I’d rather keep it simple and be by myself this time. I’ve checked hotel prices, and they’re reasonable but when you add in gas, food, and some shopping, it would still add up.

So, what do you guys think? Would it be dumb to go on a short solo trip like this? Do you think it’s just a mood that I’ll get over soon? I’m just worried I’ll make the long trip there to realize I’m actually stupid and it was a waste of time and money.

I’m into languages (professionally and for fun). For instance I speak Mandarin, Russian and currently learning Turkish 🇹🇷 I also travel quite often!
I have adhd (the calmer version and mostly managed lol). It just means I enjoy deep conversations and (over)sharing stuff a bit haha

To me, it seems like it is very easy to meet new people in Paris. I usually do it through meetups or different clubs. But it is hard to truly connect. I've also noticed that I bond easier with foreigners than locals. Probably because we have the same struggles 😂 What are your thoughts? Do you feel the same way?

Anyway, if you’re up for coffee, a walk, language exchange, museum hangout etc... DM me :)",2,1761987893.0,SocialParis,0,1.0,False

Almost everything we do, even the  “good” stuff, has a self serving reason behind it. We help people because it makes us feel good, or we want to look kind, or we expect it to come back around later.

Alot of friendships and relationships are basically trades. “I’ll be there for you because you’re there for me.” The second that stops being true, people start pulling away or acting distant. It’s not really about being moral or loyal, it’s about what benefits them.

Manipulation doesn’t always mean lying or being toxic. It’s often subtle…using tone, timing, sympathy, or selective honesty to steer things in your favor. We do it at work, with family, with friends, even online. Most people just don’t call it manipulation because it doesn’t feel malicious.

You see it everywhere:

The “helpful” friend who’s always doing favors but gets salty when you don’t return them.

The “nice” coworker who brings coffee for everyone and flatters the boss to stay in the good books.

The “selfless” partner who sacrifices all the time, then guilt trips you with “after everything I’ve done for you.”

The family member who constantly checks in, but mostly to stay in control or look like the “responsible one.”

The person who posts about charity or “raising awareness,” but it’s really about getting likes and validation.

The people pleaser who says yes to everything just to avoid conflict and make sure nobody dislikes them.

I’m not saying everyone’s a bad person…we’re all wired to look out for ourselves. But truly selfless actions are a lot rarer than people like to believe. Most “good people” are just better at dressing up their self-interest as kindness.

TLDR: Most people aren’t as kind as they think. They’re just strategic about how they act and what they get from it.",34,1761987667.0,unpopularopinion,45,0.73,False

1olj2sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/milgram/comments/1olj2sx/muu_and_rei_are_two_sides_of_a_coin_bit_of_meta/,Muu and Rei are two sides of a Coin + bit of Meta Analysis,"Before y'all yell at me, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/milgram/comments/1oemyg9/discussion_on_judgmentvotingcivility/) about why you shouldn't :))))

Jokes aside, please be respectful. I dislike Fuuta, and I like Muu as a character, but I would still vote innocent for both (the reason I dislike Fuuta is because I was cyber bullied, more or less). And I don't agree with a lot of people who, apparently, have equated Fuuta inno and Muu guilty to misogyny, because it's not that simple. I could make a separate post detailing the similarities and why I understand the comparisons, but the point is that even if I understand the similarities, it doesn't mean we should be brigading each other lol. If anything, we should be in harmony, but alas. The ragebait nature of the internet.

Moving on.

I don't understand how people don't make the connection between Muu stabbing Rei and Rei hitting Muu with a chair. Of course, there is a matter of intent, but the facts of the matter are as such: person A attacks person B for indirectly making their social life miserable.

Are there complexities to it? Of course, it's Milgram. But my argument isn't about the complexities, it's that this is an *intentional comparison on the Milgram creator's parts*.

From T1 to T3, what has been a major feature of Muu's MVs?

Hourglasses. An hourglass that is flipped over, shattered. Explicitly flipped over by Rei, in T2.

We are meant to understand, in a very explicit way, that Muu led to Rei being bullied, and Rei led to Muu being bullied. The question we are meant to ask ourselves is ""Would we forgive Muu if she started it?""

The entire sequence of events is exactly as the Milgram creators wanted. T1 sets up the initial, seemingly simple question: would you forgive Muu for stabbing her bully and/or someone who ignored her when she was being bullied?

Given she was voted innocent (though not as much as the creators may have expected lol), the answer is generally ""yes.""

T2 adds the complexity of: what if you found out that Muu was in fact, the bully first, and her bullying came afterwards?

T3 adds the final complexity: what if she never explicitly bullied anyone, and never spoke of it?

The entire point is that we are led, step by step, to a series of reversals, but also to question how much ""responsibility"" Muu has in the situation, and how much she is to blame.

When Muu breaks the hourglass-- because *she is the one breaking it, by stabbing Rei*\-- she's ending the cycle of ""who's on top, who's on the bottom.""

I'm not saying that Muu is right or wrong, because that's up to you to decide.

However, I have trouble understanding people who forgive Rei of all crime and blame Muu, because it feels like bias against Muu (though I understand that there's more to it than just that, but there is a real tendency, particularly on Reddit, to ""hate on the popular girl""). It should be noted that I specifically talk about people who seemingly don't acknowledge that Rei hit Muu with a chair hard enough to make her throw up, then went and threatened (punched?) Muu afterwards.

[chair to the ouch](https://preview.redd.it/jjxuxoromlyf1.png?width=1714&format=png&auto=webp&s=035a831ba1703a9aeb859d69f336a217441dd7e5)

Now I'm going to actually talk about things instead of just postulating lol.

In her T1, After Pain, we see a chalkboard. I'm going to be referencing Rochisama's Translation [here](https://rochisama.wordpress.com/2021/06/24/milgram-mu-after-pain-mv-text/).

We actually see two different chalkboards, as well as that phone dialogue from Muu.

The first one is obviously directed at Muu, with comments like ""Class 1-A “Trash”\[1,2\]noki Mu-chan❤️"" and ""“It hurts\~ (cry)”"". But the second one is directed at Rei, as indicated by the drawings,

[Rei's curls outward \\""Drew a picture of you❤️\\""](https://preview.redd.it/evk0ajxsnlyf1.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba6b84709f10ace0c5ab11712fae1fd400661180)

[Rei's outward curls \\""\(hanging\) or \(stabbed\)?? Which will it be\~\\""](https://preview.redd.it/angb5ppwnlyf1.png?width=260&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f197922723a671d2946e2026af233658137e0a)

It could be argued it's meant to be Muu, who also technically has outward curls, but her's are much more subdued, plus the text seems less targeted than the previous one if it's meant to represent Muu.

In further evidence, there's stuff on two different desks.

[directed at Muu: shoe on her desk](https://preview.redd.it/3n1aox6folyf1.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=f10f8567f08f189b6731fbed2520caed3c5a6d89)

[directed at Rei: chrysanthemum on her desk](https://preview.redd.it/avyvyymholyf1.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe794692f7e41ef18e3b55d7333c47ee9879ea72)

Three things should be noted here.

First is the shoe on Muu's desk. As people have postulated, shoes off in Japan is representative of suicide, and this is possibly telling Muu to kill herself. However, it's hard to say because I'm not intimately familiar with, uh, how kids bully each other in Japan (though I know more than I wish I did).

Second is the vase of chrysanthemums. For those unawares, chrysanthemums are used at Asian funerals, and putting chrysanthemums on someone's desk is a way to represent that they have died. It is *also*, for the same reason, a way of telling someone to kill themselves. Muu is, noticeably, holding a chrysanthemum in this scene in what I believe to be a show of nostalgia.

Third is *what* is said on Muu's chalkboard.

10 – Criminal

13 – I did nothing wrong💦 ←huh?! \[4\]

14 – DIE

15 – The trash of society❤️

16 – You should go to a reformatory

17 – trash trash trash trash \[2\]

I believe that what this is indicates is that Muu wasn't sent to Milgram immediately after committing her murder (though if there is evidence otherwise, do tell). Regardless, it's indicating that her classmates blame her for either Rei's bullying or Rei's murder (one of which is much more hypocritical than the other, given Rei's chalkboard says ""7 – Just notice that everyone hates you already\~🥺💦"" and ""8 – Signed by everyone together"").

I think that, in T1, Muu's confused as to why her friends abandoned her, and doesn't really understand it-- nor did she really understand Rei's suffering, until she was in her shoes. After Pain, I take it, is Muu in denial. Denial that her world was turned around, that her friends betrayed her, that she was bullied, that she killed someone. That's why we see that her clothes are dry during her bullying scenes, which led people to postulate that Muu was projecting onto Rei, when we see in T3 that Muu was, in fact, bullied, and her clothes did get wet and dirty. Muu was trying to internally deny what happened.

The song starts with ""I overheard, I found out How much I’m not needed"" ""There’s no special meaning, I got the short end of the stick"" ""My sorry spells must be wearing off""

She found out that her status at the top is not established, but importantly, she expresses a sentiment of ""I just got unlucky."" She also expresses that her ""sorry spells must be wearing off,"" that is, that her apologies weren't working anymore.

Later, she says ""But I guess some of it is my fault Maybe it’s ok as it is"" We see this transition to ""“I’m sorry” won’t reach anyone"" ""I hope it will someday"" This, I see it, is her feeling bad for Rei/regretting what Rei underwent and wanting to apologize.

We see her reading her phone messages, the ones where her friends thank her for the lipstick (which, in conjunction with Muu's own sentiment shows how flawed her idea of friendship was), and we see Muu stomp on her phone in anger.

I strongly believe that what happened later was that Muu did intend to kill herself, *after confessing to Rei*.

""I don’t want tomorrow to come, I want to forget yesterday  
I was miserable, someone please help me""

""Maybe I’m done  
Just one more time before saying goodbye  
I’m just kidding, please forget I said that""

What I think that ""one more time"" is, is Muu intending to apologize one last time. Muu ended up confessing, whether because it was her true feelings from the beginning (possible), what she came to feel after being bullied (also possible), or even just false feelings of love as a result of the situation. Rei, obviously, took this confession rather poorly, understandably enough, but Muu, in hearing that, felt overwhelmed and stabbed Rei. I don't think that Muu's murder of Rei was premeditated, which is an important factor.

It should be stated that Muu *was* bullied, and bullied hard. We see it in T3, how things are thrown at her, but it's not just in the physical bullying. It's also in how it makes Muu feel: unnecessary, isolated, and laughed at. As someone who was bullied myself, I understand very much the feeling of ""my feelings are something for you to laugh at.""

This is best represented in Muu asking ""I want to feel “alive”, is it ok if I breathe?"" and her banging on the thick hourglass, only to be filmed and laughed by her *former friends*. It's furthered by the scene where she's attacked by Rei in T3, and she reaches out and her eyes *lose light because she realizes no one is going to help her.*

Putting aside that they were obviously fake friends, this is the definition of friendship that Muu had grown to think was normal. Even in Milgram, she thinks friendship is her giving, to make her friends happy. She doesn't understand what a ""true friend"" is, because she never had someone like that.

All she understands is that, all of a sudden, her friends not only abandoned her but even became the ones bullying her.

T2 is Muu understanding the wrong of her ways. This is, obviously, up to the interpretation, but my interpretation was that she was painting herself the villain to show her own evil. We see this done a *lot* in Milgram. How people portray themselves in Milgram is a focal point. **Look at how Kazui, Fuuta (T3), John (T2), and Yuno depict themselves**.

Seeing yourself as bad and depicting yourself as the villain is a sign of remorse in your MV. Compare it to, say, how Kotoko conveys herself (as a bringer of justice, then a prison warden)-- btw the Kotoko theory is coming but I'm plagued by exams and I've been brewing the Muu one longer-- or how Fuuta T1/T2 conveys himself.

**Being evil in your MV is seeing yourself as evil,** and having remorse for your crimes, whatever they may be.

This is just exacerbated in T3, where she literally says ""I’ll take on the role of villain, I just want you to apologize to him"".

I think that Muu's understanding of the events evolved, from T1 to T2 to T3.

In T1, she only saw herself as the victim, with brief flickering understands of her wrongdoing.

In T2, she saw herself as the villain, taking all the blame for herself, even depicting everything as her master plan.

And in T3? She sees herself as a bystander, who is forced to take the blame for the actions of everyone.

*Before you immediately hate her, please keep reading.*

Do you know what I find incredibly ironic?

If Muu had killed herself, I think you could see Rei make a series of the same songs. From ""I was bullied first"" to ""I shouldn't have blamed her"" to ""was it really my fault?""

This is intentional.

Whether you agree that Muu is really a bystander or not, you should also agree that Rei has a similar role, though not intentional. Muu's discomfort led to Rei being bullied. Rei attacking Muu led to Muu being bullied.

We are given that Muu didn't want Rei to be bullied by the reports. It's possible that Jackalope is biased towards Muu and was more favorable in his report than in others, but Muu is also painted negatively in many ways in this report (""The girl's actions caused Muu discomfort. Her entourage, as always, sensed this discomfort, and soon, bullying of the girl began."" ""*Muu understood, however, that anyone who rebels against her must fall, and that she was undoubtedly the center of the universe."" ""In that instant, the anger that was lying dormant inside of Muu wells up - there can be no forgiveness for giving her that look."")*. As such, I find it hard to believe that Jackalope is biased, and I believe instead that, from a meta POV, the intent is to show that Muu is a bystander. Compare these two actions:

""*Muu gives no orders. She does not bring up the girl in conversation.""*  
VS  
""*The girl, newly freed from the bullying, seemed to take absolutely no interest in Muu's predicament, only deigning her a single glance.""*

From the perspective of a victim, it's easy to blame the bystander who seemingly looks down on or doesn't care for your plight.

That's why Rei attacks Muu, who she believes (rightfully, to be fair) to be responsible, even if indirectly, for her suffering.

That's why Muu wants to get validation from Rei and later attacks Rei, who is also responsible, indirectly, for her suffering.

I think people underplay the suffering that both Rei and Muu went. Both of them snapped. Both of them hurt people. Rei was isolated and bullied just because, what, she didn't play nice? And Muu was isolated and bullied because she threw up.

If you believe Muu should be voted guilty for killing Rei, who was innocent, that's okay by me, as long as you also think that her bullying classmates should also be voted guilty, because Muu's case report is about social hierarchy and bullying in Japan, and outcasts. Muu is the ""odd one out,"" for being mixed, beautiful, rich, and Rei is the ""odd one out"" for not worshipping her.

It's a commentary on the Japanese idiom ""the nail that sticks out gets hammered down"". On how you have to fit in, or you'll get bullied. If you stop the bullying, guess who's the new target? You.

If Muu had stopped it, she would have been bullied.

She did nothing, and was bullied.

I think a lot about how, in real life, people like Muu are worshipped, but people like Muu are also isolated and bullied. Being a foreigner, mixed, odd, in any way in Japan or Asian societies in general is a bad thing. East Asian societies are insular and xenophobic, both in ""positive"" and ""negative"" ways. There are ""weeaboos"" and racists, but both are ultimately not grasping the point: their viewpoint of either worship or hate ignores the real, complex character of the person they're worshipping/hating.

I think it's important to remember the difference between our society and Japanese society, and understand why *all the top comments on Muu's video call her a bystander*. (though, bias is also a thing that exists)

# TW for IRL suicidal ideation/attempt. Skip to bold for relevant part (Haruka)

But in real life (canon event), I've been suicidal for a majority of my life. My best friend was aware of this, and I put the burden of asking them to call the cops after I killed myself on them once. I feel terrible for it now, though I also understand that my mental state was obviously not great at the time, but the burden must have been terrible nonetheless.

I understand that to a normal person, this is crazy. Why wouldn't she call the cops before? Have me thrown into a mental hospital?

Because she understood two things.

1. I have an incurable illness with a bad prognosis (though this is no longer true). Living is painful. Another day is another day of pain. *This is still true, even with how much better I am now.* I still think about suicide, but it's not 24/7, maybe weekly, monthly if I get lucky. She told me recently that she never thought about the future with me because, to her, ""I was already dead."" This is not her fault. It's how I thought of my future too, but I feel terrible having imparted that onto her.
2. If I wanted to kill myself, I would find a way. I still think about this.

If you want to kill yourself, you can find a way, unless you are completely paralyzed or permanently bound in a stagnant position without any surface to bang yourself against.

I remember being in the mental hospital.

I remember the nurses laughing.

Because a patient, who was trying to kill herself through starvation, had eaten a little bit of sugar. Literally, less than a packet of what you use as sweetener for coffee, which was where she had gotten it.

They mocked her lack of resolve. Lack of ability.

They didn't say it to her face, thankfully, but I remember it vividly and painfully.

This was over the course of several days of her not eating, which I didn't even realize was happening despite sharing mealtimes with her. I didn't realize at all, until I overheard the nurses.

**If Haruka wanted to die, he would find a way. Regardless of what Muu wanted or said. Regardless of what Muu did.**

If you want to blame Muu for encouraging Haruka's suicide, then I understand. I personally believe Muu didn't want Haruka to die, but I also acknowledge that frankly, we don't see enough to make a definitive conclusion imo. But I hope you won't blame her for not preventing his death entirely. Even if you think she knew he wasn't eating. Because someone who wants to die will find a way to.

This whole post is a mess. I woke up and couldn't sleep so I wrote it up. I have a lot more jumbled thoughts floating around that I might make as posts later on, but I'm tired so I'm just gonna post this as is.

I will give a bit of background my husband only wants one coffee a day before he goes to work, I have an espresso machine but he isn't into making coffee. He has been telling me he likes pod machines since he went to a hotel for a week, he loves the idea of just pressing a button and having a hot drink. He is 100% someone who likes convenience over quality or taste and, he is big into gadgets,machines and robots, he works with electronics as a job.
He likes how capsules create no mess, compared to grinding your own and so on with my espresso machine.
I looked into Jura but they are too expensive for one cup a day.
If the price for no milk machines is allot cheaper, we don't need one that make milk. Also I guess he would like a pod machine but I think he will find super auto just as good as it's cheaper per cup and it's still coffee at a touch of a button.
For maintenance he really enjoys fixing and cleaning and maintaining machines, that's actually one thing he does at work, so anything that is easy to fix and find parts for and self maintain is a bonus.
We are on relatively low income too so pods would be too expensive.
As for budget I'm not sure really hopefully under £300, or perhaps a good deal, or refurbished or second hand.
Any thoughts?

1olj22m,https://i.redd.it/wtjxhn041myf1.jpeg,COFFEE POINTS ☕,"Hello Tapblaze Devs,

I really enjoy playing your game, but there’s one thing that’s been bugging me. When I level up, the bonus energy/coffee points don’t actually stack past the cap. For example, I was at 110/120, leveled up, and it said +120, but it just topped me off at 120/120. Basically, I only got 10 instead of the full 120. 😩

It feels a bit unfair, since it makes leveling up less exciting. Could you make it so that the reward can go over the cap (like 230/120) or at least turn the extra into something else (like coins or points)? That would make a huge difference!

Thanks for reading — I really love the game overall, just hoping for a little tweak to make it even better.

Amanda’s heart skipped a beat. 

“Don’t answer-” 

“Hello?” he cut her off, already reaching for the phone. 

It was too late. 

Whatever the person on the other end said, it made Travis‘ face go dark. He stood up, all business.

All he left was a cold back and a single, icy sentence. 

“The engagement party’s off.” 

It felt like someone had stabbed Amanda in the chest. She couldn’t breathe. 

She wanted to stop him, to say something, but her feet felt glued to the floor, too heavy to move. 

Then came the slam of the front door.

A minute ago, she’d looked so happy. Now all she saw was a pale, broken girl in a white dress. 

Her phone buzzed. 

A message. 

Leila: I won. 

A bitter smile tugged at Amanda’s lips. 

Of course she did. 

Leila was Travis‘ one that got away, the girl he’d never stopped loving.

Her birthday. 

Their anniversaries. 

All those dates she’d planned… 

And now, even before their engagement party, Travis didn’t even hesitate to leave her behind. 

Didn’t he know how this would humiliate her? That everyone would laugh at her?

Amanda took a deep breath. 

She pulled up her chat with Travis.

She hit send, then blocked his number. 

She packed her suitcase and dragged it to the elevator, only to hear a sharp whistle behind her.

James–Travis‘ annoying cousin. 

James worshipped Travis, always acting as if his perfect cousin deserved the best of the best. And in James‘ eyes, Amanda was just some country nobody, never good enough. 

He’d tormented her for years. 

James swaggered over, a smirk plastered across his face.

He clapped, and in seconds, half a dozen of his buddies surrounded her, phones out, ready to record her humiliation.

1olj1q4,https://i.redd.it/bp9y5qvz0myf1.jpeg,2 months of ADF and 2 stone down,"Just a wee brain dump:

-Coffee and water only unless I'm really struggling in which case a splash of milk in my coffee or a cup of <20 calorie miso broth stuff (I think the salt helps)


- Generally trying to eat at goal weight maintenance (1600) on eating days so that I can learn the good habits now and not just gain it all back when I stop but sometimes think that might be a touch low during ADF. Focusing on low gi foods rather than specifically low carb - high protein and not being afraid of fats, always makes the fast next day easier. Importantly, no desire to binge of overeat at all on eating days which is surprising considering heavy restriction is normally a recipe for failure.


- A couple short fasts thrown in to switch the days around and fit in with social events 'cause I'm not doing all this to be miserable!


- The last few fast days have actually been super hard - mentally more than physically- so I'm considering moving to modified fasting with a few hundred calories but might see how I feel on the day - perhaps knowing the option is there will take the mental strain off a little bit.


- two dresses that previously didn't fit are now back in rotation, nobody has really been able to see a difference yet but the paper towel effect is coming and the only way to get there is to keep going.


ADF feels like a bit of a cheat code, diets have always been a long drawn out slog of difficulty until the eventual binge and give up, but this is hard for about 5 hours every other day and then it's all fine again!",10,1761987342.0,AlternateDayFasting,1,1.0,False

She packed her suitcase and dragged it to the elevator, only to hear a sharp whistle behind her. 

Amanda’s expression soured. She’d hated that sound for years. 

James–Travis‘ annoying cousin. 

James worshipped Travis, always acting as if his perfect cousin deserved the best of the best. And in James‘ eyes, Amanda was just some country nobody, never good enough. 

He’d tormented her for years. 

James swaggered over, a smirk plastered across his face. 

“Well, well! Engagement’s off, huh? Must be embarrassing. Trying to sneak out in shame? Come on, you really think I’d let you leave that easy? Hey, everyone, get over here!” 

He clapped, and in seconds, half a dozen of his buddies surrounded her, phones out, ready to record her humiliation. 

James grinned, loving every second. 

“So, Amanda, engagement canceled. How does it feel?**”** 

The others snickered, their eyes full of mockery. 

Amanda felt numb. 

She’d lived through this kind of thing for seven years. 

She crossed her arms and gave James a look that was half smile, half challenge. 

“How do I feel? Pretty awful, thanks for asking. But honestly, nothing could feel worse than being you–a bastard. Isn’t that right?” 

The room went dead quiet. 

James‘ face turned beet red. 

He might be Travis‘ cousin, but everyone knew he was only part of the family by name. His mom had had an affair, and James was the result–a secret he hated more than anything. 

Before, Amanda had put up with his bullying for the sake of peace. Now? She didn’t have to care 

anymore. 

James lost it. “You bitch! You asking for trouble?” 

He raised his hand to slap her. 

Amanda didn’t even flinch. She sidestepped, then kicked him square in the stomach. 

James stumbled back and crashed to the floor, looking at her like she’d grown a second head. 

“You hit me? Aren’t you scared I’ll tell Travis?” 

Amanda glared down at him. 

“Go ahead, you spoiled brat. I only tolerated you because of Travis. Now that I’m done with him, you really think I’ll put up with you?” 

She turned to leave, suitcase in hand. 

James screamed after her. 

“Fine! If you’re so tough, don’t ever come back then! Don’t you dare go crawling to my cousin!” 

Amanda paused. 

James noticed and sneered. 

“Regretting it already? Ha! You’re just a desperate little puppy. If *you* want me *to* keep quiet, get on your knees and lick my shoes. Maybe then I’ll forgive you.” 

Amanda’s lips twitched. 

She saw one of his friends still recording with his phone. 

Amanda stared straight into the camera.

Amanda stood in front of the mirror, her white dress hugging her curves perfectly. The makeup artist had worked magic on her already lovely face, making her look even more radiant than usual. 

Today was supposed to be the happiest day–her engagement to Travis. 

Travis was lounging on the sofa, tall and impossibly handsome, like a work of art that had somehow come to life. He had this magnetic energy about him, this natural confidence that filled the room even when he said nothing. 

He looked up at her, his eyes dark and unreadable. 

Before he could answer, his phone rang on the coffee table. 

Amanda’s heart skipped a beat. 

“Don’t answer-” 

“Hello?” he cut her off, already reaching for the phone. 

It was too late. 

Whatever the person on the other end said, it made Travis‘ face go dark. He stood up, all business. 

“I’ll be there right away,” he said, and then hung up. 

He grabbed his jacket, barely sparing her a glance. 

All he left was a cold back and a single, icy sentence. 

“The engagement party’s off.” 

It felt like someone had stabbed Amanda in the chest. She couldn’t breathe. 

She wanted to stop him, to say something, but her feet felt glued to the floor, too heavy to move. 

Then came the slam of the front door. 

Amanda just stood there, staring at her reflection. 

A minute ago, she’d looked so happy. Now all she saw was a pale, broken girl in a white dress. 

Her phone buzzed. 

A message. 

Leila: I won. 

A bitter smile tugged at Amanda’s lips. 

Of course she did. 

Leila was Travis‘ one that got away, the girl he’d never stopped loving. 

Amanda had spent seven years by Travis‘ side, loving him, trying to make him happy–but in the end, 

Chapter **1** 

it was all a joke. One call from Leila, and Travis would drop everything for her. No matter when, no matter what. 

Her birthday. 

Their anniversaries. 

All those dates she’d planned… 

And now, even before their engagement party, Travis didn’t even hesitate to leave her behind. 

Didn’t he know how this would humiliate her? That everyone would laugh at her? 

Of course he knew. 

He just didn’t care. 

A tear slid down Amanda’s cheek. 

The pain was overwhelming. 

But mixed in with the hurt, there was something else. Relief. 

She had fought for this relationship for seven years. 

Seven years of swallowing her pride, of pretending she didn’t notice how little she mattered. She was so tired. 

The engagement party was supposed to be their last chance. And apparently, Travis didn’t care at all. 

Amanda took a deep breath.

But when they suck it dry, they will dispose it. If there is no use FOR THEM in it, they might even destroy it !” Thats how they see other human beings. They can’t comprehend that human beings have honor, feelings or a soul.

It made me think of this scene from my childhood when I was an eleven year old child and I visited this stupid cousin with my dad. The cousin complained about his wife and how she’s always stressed and how she screams at him bc they had 3 children together. My dad told the cousin in front of  HIS OWN daughter : “ just impregnate her with another child. She (meaning his wife) will leave you alone “ . 

Can you imagine what an asshole you have to be to tell someone infront of your own flesh and blood that children are a means to an end? 
Whatever happened to evolutionary biology where we are programmed to love and cherish our offspring ? Whatever happened to the fact that pregnancies are hard on the woman and how can you inflict so much harm on your wife just so.. she will leave you alone?

At first they were very light and they went away after sitting down for like 5-10 minutes. The episodes usually happen when I am standing, but not always.
But one day when I went to work, I had the worst episode after walking 200m, that didn't went away when sitting down. So a neighbor drove me to the hospital. I have some anemia, but other than that they couldn't find anything, so after a few days and an iron IV I went home, with iron pills, and other minerals and vitamins treatment.
Since then, I haven't left my home alone: I only had like 3 days without them at all. Otherwise, they can happen on my way to the bathroom, or after climbing down 15 steps, or after climbing down 3 stores and walking 50m, more often in the morning, but not always.
The OB says the sensations normal, and the internal medicine doctor said to repeat the anemia analysis the following week and if they are still bad to get some iron injections.
Now, I've been trying to analyze them and they seem to start with a pressure below the belly button(even if I had just peed) and if I don't sit/lay down, all simptoms appear.
Today I have noticed that this pressure appeared after drinking water (1/2 cup) and coffee (1/4 cup).  I also have a complete praevia, and the babies are like 2 weeks more developed than their age.
But is anybody else experienced this? Stupid questions: is my stomach full of liquids pusshing down on my placenta and to a blood vasel causing me to faint?

1oliu5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1oliu5d/should_i_be_cautious_of_this_friendship/,Should I be cautious of this friendship,"I made a new friend around 3 years ago. We met online, live in the same city and after a few months of intense texting we met. We are both very outgoing people, I'm a woman and he is a man. We have one year age gap so the dynamics was fine.

I realised quite early on that we indeed are quite different. They like to be in charge. It's actually ridiculous but sometimes I couldn't even suggest which side of the street to walk on, they wanted to walk on that side and that was the end of it. 

They also didn't have a lot of other close friends. Neither did I but I was sorta fine with it, wasn't lonely, had started uni and was buuuusy. So when I spoke of meeting new people, being excited, they got mad. 

They have a tendency to lash out. We had a few arguments where they just got mad and told me off. They really hated everything about me and everything I did was cruel yet all the actions were also my fault. The first time it happened when I was busy hanging out with uni friends, I sensed they got jealous and lashed out.

They made rules how we shouldn't text during his work hours and I pointed out that it's not fair to make a rule when I don't have the same rule for my work (I have night shifts). Then they sorta forgot about it a month later and the intense texting began again.

I could never really talk to them about my life without them just sharing about their life. They always gave me a really detailed explanations of what to do, which is nice ish but I just wanted to have a chat, not argue with them how those are not really realistic options. 

I think they love bombed me a lot. Like the advices, lengthy messages which are hard to read. Gives the idea of them caring but afterwards I realize it was exhausting. They also texted me loads during their work days just to tell me what they are doing and then disappear. Really distracted my studying.

We then had a falling out about 6 months ago and decided to take a break. I got annoyed by them calling me exhausting when I mentioned one of my friends was exhausting me. It was really rude, they share me so much of their life yet I never called them exhausting. And so the flood gates opened and I was being negative, always wanting to be right, always so so selfish and such. I said it can't just be me and it's a mutual effort sort of thing but he just saw my doings. So we had a break.

Now we have started to meet up again, he was very excited that I texted them and immediately wanted to make plans. But he cuts the convos short via text by sending a thumbs up or just not keeping it going. That's fine, got the memo, decided to level my effort there. It happened a few times so I took it as the new habit. Then they sort of suddenly after a few months do want to text, text in the middle of the day but I did not want to and I decided I can give the effort I want, not always need to respond like he expects. So I kept the conversation short, I was busy with studying, had no desire to chat at that moment.

I did then make an effort to share about something that annoyed me in my own life and they just sorta said ""too bad"" and went on to ramble about their life, then asked me how I'm doing, I was feeling sad as I had just shared and they are doing so great, moving in with the girl friend next year and such and such. It made me had a flash back of how he just sort of gives me a few minute long monologue about his life every time we interact, it doesn't feel like a dialogues, he just shares everything and Idk what to say next cos there was so much information and he gets annoyed if I don't give detailed comments about everything. He used to complain when I didn't comment on every TikTok he sent.

So now I'm sorta wanting a coffee frienship with him, see how that will go. I sent him a query of meeting in a few weeks and he immediately shares what he is doing currently, I don't respond in 30 minutes so he answers wants to have a wine night. I just said I'd rather go for a coffee and he sorta responds ""if you say so"". I don't really drink, they drink every day almost (at least when we were still friends) and I want to wake up without a headache in the middle of the week and don't really drink anymore at all. 

I just feel like there's some attitude always. He used to admit being quite manipulative in realtionships. He shared that some of his tinder dates used to say he gaslights, I can see that. Should I be concerned of letting him back in? I was the only one to say sorry for the last fight, he just thanked me.

You choose to play as a girl, working at a multistory building in downtown, with a lot of office space which is half-empty due to the ever-increasing rent, the kind of rent that no small business can really afford, but some try. There are coffee spaces, too, nooks of quiet in the sea of corporate noise. You type in the name – A.N.G.E.L.A, slowly, methodically. You choose the look – blond hair swept up with a hairclip, blue eyes, a matching shirt, a pair of pants, slightly crumpled from trying to navigate your way in the elevator during the lunch hour. And no fabric can remain crisp and smell like it is just out of the laundromat when it’s been a long (10-hr) workday, right? Your pants are grey, or bluish grey, or whatever the sales associate called them, stained with the coffee from the floor below that you spilled onto your lap during the negotiation phase of your upcoming project. It’s spread out like small punctuation marks. And you told them what you meant, and you meant what you said, and the stains are proof that you stood your ground relentlessly.

Until now.

Now you missed the cab, and it’s snowing, and you won’t be joining the festivities in time, and your family is waiting for you – like they always do. And you can call it a disruption in your schedule, a force majeure, except that the usual force majeure clause doesn’t usually come with your ankle being chained to the table and your head humming from whatever the cloth he’s shoved in your face was soaked with. He, meaning, the security guard.

His name is Thomas and right now he’s wearing a Santa hat, colored white, obviously cheap polyester drooping back over his head and the fake beard perfectly in place, which looks bigger than it should, almost swallowing his face. The whole thing is supposed to cheer you up, but just adds to the tension instead. The white stain lingers on his head like an exclamation mark above the head of an NPC who’s been summoned to save you from imminent danger. Until he removes the hat and the beard and you get what you get.

A ruthless, brutal quest of escaping the horrors of Christmas music in the parking lot, and tinsel, and garlands, and the affections of the man who thinks he’s in love with you, but had enough sensibility to severe all your connections to the world, wireless and otherwise. The festive spirit? The ultimate mockery.\*

‘Ho-ho-ho, merry Christmas! You’ve been a good little girl’, you hear.

Your vision gets blurry again. Good luck getting out.

my head was spinning, my vision is starting to blur and i was throwing up like crazy. but things kept getting worse. my body had these muscle cramps and at the same time a numb feeling. my fingers were curling towards my hands so much you can see the nail marks in my palm. and on top of that, i was hyperventilating as shit cause i cant breathe. 

so now theyre getting the car and they were struggling to carry me. now i was a mess but i can still hear them and one of them said ""wait shes heavy"" my internal jaw dropped!! at this point i just want them to leave me here to die in embarrassment thank you very much. but anyways they managed to carry my 138lbs to the car and then i woke up in the ER with dextrose line in my hand :)))))

its 5am and i was ok to go home. doctor said i was about to have a mild stroke. welp, i actually almost died and had potentially traumatized my coworkers haha but now we just laugh about it and grab drinks over coffee.

1olipfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1olipfo/my_girlfriend_ended_our_long_relationship_because/,My girlfriend ended our long relationship because she's exhausted,"Hey everyone,

I’m really struggling right now and could use some advice.

My girlfriend broke up with me a few days ago after several years together. She told me she’s exhausted with the relationship, with work, with feeling like she can’t breathe or find time for herself. She said she feels like she’s been carrying the relationship alone.

She also told me she felt like she had to spend all her free time with me, because she thought that’s what I wanted. Like she couldn’t take time for herself without making me upset.

She said I could be too controlling about small things (like hygiene or little habits), that I didn’t communicate enough, that I was too closed off emotionally. She felt like she had to talk for both of us. She also said I’d get angry too fast and say hurtful things.

Sometimes when we argued, she’d go to the bathroom to get away with our cat. Instead of letting her cool off, I’d follow her, begging her to come back and talk. I never gave her space, and I see now how suffocating that must have felt for her.

One fight still really haunts me. It was about something completely stupid. She walked away, and I lost my temper. I pushed her lightly against a wall and told her that if she wasn’t happy, she could just leave. I regret that moment deeply. She left a few weeks later.

We’d been living together for a while and got engaged not too long ago. At that time, she wrote me beautiful things, saying it was the happiest day of her life and that she was afraid of losing me. Reading her old notes now breaks my heart, she really loved me and had a fear of loosing me.

The night she told me it was over, she stayed. We held each other all night before she left in the morning.

Since then, I’ve done a lot of thinking. I’ve realized how much my anxiety, my need for control, and my temper hurt her. I started therapy to work on myself, to manage my anxiety, my emotional reactions, and to learn how to communicate better. I’m doing it for me, not just for her.

I told her that I understand what went wrong, that I believe things could be different — with better communication, more space, and me learning to handle my anxiety instead of letting it take over. She told me she still loves me and still cares about us, but that there’s just too much pain right now.

So I’m giving her space. We barely talk — just a few texts from me here and there. She turned down my offer to grab coffee this weekend, saying she’s already said everything she needed to say.

I’m completely lost. Do I still have a chance that she comes back on her decision? How can I show her that I’m really changing if we hardly talk anymore?

**Some ideas I've researched** (but open to your problems):

*For Lawyers:*

* Vernacular legal research: Ask in Hindi → get ranked precedents + summaries
* Smart contract scan: Auto-flag risky clauses against your playbook

*For Consumers:*

* Mini-ODR for MSME late payments: AI negotiation → mediation → arbitration
* Compliance radar: RBI/SEBI circulars → auto tasklists with due dates

  
**The deal:** You provide legal insights and identify the problem. I handle all the tech and building. We start with a 2-3 week pilot on one specific workflow. Worst case, we learn. Best case, we save hours every week.

There’s a quiet kind of magic in spending a Saturday afternoon tucked into a coffee shop in Indiranagar. Slow music playing, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and a book that’s been waiting all week for your attention.

After a week that felt like a marathon, this little pause feels like a reward. Just sitting there, letting the world spin while you sip and read, is oddly therapeutic.

I sometimes wonder if others enjoy this kind of slow-down too. No agenda, no rush. Just a few hours of being delightfully unproductive. Would’ve been nice to share the silence with someone who gets it.",2,1761985763.0,BangaloreMeetups,1,1.0,False

1oliimw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oliimw/i_was_the_first_responder_to_a_car_crash_the/,I Was the First Responder to a Car Crash. The Victim Had My Driver’s License.,"I’ve been a paramedic for eleven years. You get used to seeing bodies twisted in ways they shouldn’t be, faces you can’t unsee, and sounds that stick in your head long after you take off your gloves.

But nothing — *nothing* — prepares you for seeing your own face staring back at you from a stretcher.

It happened just over three weeks ago.

It was a quiet night. I was halfway through my shift, the usual routine of coffee, paperwork, and bad jokes with my partner, Jules. Dispatch crackled through at 2:13 a.m.: *“Single vehicle collision. Route 17 near mile marker 42. Unknown injuries.”*

Routine enough.

The drive was barely fifteen minutes. No traffic, just the rhythmic hum of tires and Jules humming along to the radio. When we got there, the cruiser lights from a county deputy were already painting the wet asphalt red and blue.

The car — a silver Honda Civic — had slammed into a tree. The front end was crumpled like tinfoil. Steam hissed from the radiator, mingling with smoke. The driver’s door was jammed.

I remember saying, “Let’s get the Jaws,” and Jules nodding before she went around the other side.

I leaned in through the broken window to check the driver. Male. Mid-thirties. Heavy bleeding from the scalp. Pulse — faint but there.

I froze.

Because the man’s face… it was *mine.*

Not just similar. Not just a weird resemblance. It was *me.* The same crooked nose from a high school fight, the same small scar under my left eyebrow, the same short beard I hadn’t trimmed in three days.

My throat went dry.

“Jules,” I said quietly, “get over here.”

She glanced in, expecting a medical issue. When she saw the face, she went still.

“What the hell, Ryan?”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

I checked the man’s pockets, hands shaking, as if I needed proof I wasn’t losing it. I found a wallet. Inside: my driver’s license. My photo. My name. My address.

Everything.

I stared at it so long that Jules had to snap me back. “Hey! He’s still breathing!”

We cut the door and pulled him out. His body was limp, but his chest was rising and falling. I went through the motions — oxygen mask, neck brace, vitals — but every move felt mechanical. Detached.

In the ambulance, as Jules drove, I sat beside him, staring at the face that shouldn’t exist.

He opened his eyes once. Just for a moment.

And I swear on my life — *he smiled at me.*

Then he whispered something I couldn’t hear over the siren.

By the time we reached County General, he was gone. Flatline.

I remember standing there in the ER bay, soaked in blood that felt too familiar, while nurses swarmed around us. Jules was pale. Neither of us spoke.

They took the body to the morgue.



I didn’t sleep for two days.

I kept replaying the scene, the whisper I couldn’t make out, the way his hand had brushed mine as if he meant to hold on.

Eventually, I went back to the hospital. I told the coroner I’d “left some equipment” on the gurney, but really I just wanted to *see him again.*

He was in drawer 14B.

They had cleaned him up. His face — my face — was peaceful now. I checked for any identifying marks that could explain this, some logical reason. But it was all there. The same tattoo on the shoulder. The same mole on the neck.

Then I saw something that made me step back.

A small laceration on the right palm — identical to the one I’d gotten a few hours earlier while cutting open the car door.

Except mine had already healed over.

I told myself it was impossible. Maybe some mix-up. Maybe a twin I never knew about. But I was adopted, and my parents were long gone.

That night, I dug through old boxes of paperwork. Adoption records, birth certificate, anything.

But something was off. My adoption papers were dated **June 17, 1993.**  
The man’s driver’s license said he was born **June 17, 1992.**

One year older.



A week later, I got a call from an unknown number.

When I answered, there was only static at first — then a faint voice:

“Thanks for taking my place.”

Click.

I stared at my phone until the screen dimmed.

The next morning, Jules called me, crying. She’d had a nightmare, she said. In it, I was trapped in a burning car, screaming her name. She could smell gasoline, even after she woke up.

I told her it was just stress.

But when I got to the station, my hands started shaking again.

The new shift roster was posted on the board. My name had been crossed out.

No one could tell me why.

When I went to HR to check my file, the clerk frowned. “There’s no Ryan Harlow listed here. Are you sure you’re with the county EMS?”

I showed her my badge. She looked confused. “This badge number was deactivated last week. After the fatality.”

The room felt like it was closing in.

I stumbled outside.

And that’s when I saw it.

A news van parked across the street. The logo on the side read *Channel 9 News – Fatal Crash Anniversary Coverage.*

The date below it: **November 1st, 2024.**

*Anniversary.*

I don’t know how long I stood there before I realized what it meant.

I pulled out my phone, opened the camera app, and turned it toward my face.

The screen flickered — and for a split second, I didn’t see my reflection.

I saw *him.*

Blood on his forehead. Eyes glassy.

Smiling.

Then the screen went black.

If you’re a paramedic and get a call to Route 17, near mile marker 42—

Don’t come.

Because I’ll already be there.

I have been talking to someone for a few months, we have not met yet as he has been too busy and we are not in a relationship. We are both 28. 
I’m housebound apart from church on Sundays due to a recent stroke I had in August. 
One of my old male friends/collegues knocked on my door for a catch up this week, I thought it was lovely someone had been thinking of me and agreed for the coffee, in my eyes this is completely innocent. 
However when I told the guy I was talking to he flew off the handle, he needed around 20 hours before sending me 3 huge paragraphs on how he has been in fight or flight mode, has ignored red flags before and it’s got him hurt, said he ‘doesn’t allow his partner to have male friends’ and lots of stern strong comments on how I need to decide if I could be with someone like him.
It really scared me. He said he’s not controlling but throughout the messages it screamed control, I’ve been here so many times. But he was also using God to try and soften it which doesn’t work. 
In the bible I don’t believe wives were caged from male workers, I believe this is from past hurt/insecurity and I shouldnt have to avoid males because of his past when I haven’t done anything to hurt him. I only want to love and nurture him, but I can’t see how I can do that now with the way he has spoke to me.

 I really don’t know what to do because he gave the me ultimatum of it either male friends or him, and I only have 2, I see them once every couple of years, they are good friends. It’s not my hurt to carry. I am a strong God fearing woman and I should be able to be trusted when I haven’t done anything wrong

I guess I’m looking for advice, support, opinions? We was building something special but his language and fear provoking words isn’t something I want to live with again. ",2,1761985116.0,ChristianDating,34,0.75,False

What to do?,"We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

At the plant there were like 7 layers between us. Got married within a year.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

He wants another baby and keeps pushing me very hard for it. But I told him I am not having sex with him without birth control. For now I just don't want to do it anyway.

He was having a very important meeting with half of his subordinates as the year will end soon and our son kept pulling his arm because he wanted something from the fridge. I couldn't help. And my husband kept dismising him and told him he is busy and to go away and then called me to come and take him, while muting and unmuting his mic. Our son got frustrated too, started crying and in the end he spanked him so bad that my child fell to the floor. And then he ran to me crying and I talked to him and said dad didn't want to, but I will talk to him and he said its not the first time.

1olifp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1olifp6/cobwebs/,Cobwebs,"I wish I could remember the beginning.



If something had happened, if there was a moment where I could have looked around and said, “this is wrong,” maybe things could have been different. But it didn’t happen. It always was, and so it was normal. 



In kindergarten, when we’d draw pictures of our family and mine contained a dark, spindly creature clinging to the ceiling, my teachers would just smile and move on. They never asked, and never heard when I told them. My peers noticed, though, and asked. And I would tell them, and they’d tell me about their dad’s rocket ship, or their pet T-rex. I tried to explain that mine was real, and they’d insist that so was theirs. I showed them the marks, and they showed me skinned knees and mosquito bites. I learned not to mention it at all, to anyone. Eventually, when asked to do so, I would draw someone else’s family to save myself the headache.



As I got older, pushing through the frenzied forest of adolescence into high school, my peers slowly stopped responding when I brought it up. Their eyes would glaze over, and they’d say something noncommittal, and then it was like I’d not said anything. Puberty seemed to dull their senses to my pleas, like the adults. I yearned for my senses to soften like theirs, and when they didn’t, I had to make them. And so I began to drink. 



My shoddy academic performance was further hamstrung by a near constant state of inebriation. When I crawled out of high school, diploma barely secured, the only college that would have me was the local one. I spread my wings and flew two blocks over to Charlotte State University, where my vices were accepted with open arms. No longer was I the shuffling, mute outcast. I was the life, the spark of the party. I drank, and they cheered me for it. The brief, electrifying attention always gave way as the night wore on, when people had no further need of a jester. But it was more than I’d ever known, so I remained. 



The night we met, I was slumped in the corner of some loud, chaotic household that reeked of weed and body odor. I had long since made myself known, and the festivities had long since outlived my usefulness. My head kept drooping, and when it did I would take another tiny sip from my bottle, like a stranded man on his final water ration. I didn’t notice her sitting beside me until she nudged my bottle arm. 



“Are you alright?” 



I turned through molasses towards her, certain she’d mistaken me for someone else, but her eyes were on mine. Green, glittering emeralds set in a round sunbeam of a face, entirely comprehensible despite the low strobing lights. My dry mouth worked as my mind’s cold engine stuttered, desperate to turn over. 



“Are you alright?” she asked again, and my mind finally chugged to life.



“Yeah,” I said, blinking hard. 



“Good,” she said, her smile flashing in the gloom like a bolt of radiant lightning. “Thought I lost you, there.”



I squinted at her, certain we’d never met, but bending my brain to remember her. I’d have liked to. The girl leaned back against the wall, watching a man with beer cans attached to his head trying to mount a table. 



“Can I sit here? With you?” she asked. “This is all… it’s just a lot, you know?”



She turned to me, and I realized I’d not answered her question. I nodded dumbly, and she laughed, for some reason. My heart did a strange, hot palpitation at the sound, and I realized that I needed to keep making her laugh, by any means necessary. I nodded to the beer-headed guy, woozily gesticulating with my free hand. 



“He’s my ride,” I managed. It didn’t make much sense, but she laughed again, and again my heart seized pleasingly. We stayed there, bunched against the wall for hours until one of the fraternity brothers hoisted me aloft and spilled me onto the street like a bag of garbage. My bottle, untouched for the past hours, miraculously survived the impact. I struggled to a seat on the sidewalk, eyeing the bottle’s remaining drink like the stranded man eyes salt water; knowing it’ll turn his guts and mind to poison, but hoping beyond hope it may slake his thirst. 



“Hey!” came her voice, which I’d already learned to love. My eyes jerked to the opulent staircase around which other ousted males lingered, desperate to be granted further access to the Greek utopia. She was descending around and between young, indignant men, lightning smile visible despite the distance, and my state. “Hey,” she said again as she sidled up beside me, looking around like a stage actor. “Where’s your ride?”



It was my turn to laugh, a rusty cough that came out of my nose, ugly where hers was divine. She had not been drinking, and offered me a ride home, if I could remember where it was. I accepted, increasingly certain that I’d finally broken from reality, that I was now adrift in an idealized mental construction. 



When I awoke the next morning, the pain in my head was expected, but the sticky note was not. I pulled it off my forehead, squinting through the hangover. The phone number meant nothing, but the name brought it all back in a rush, endorphins powerful enough to banish the headache, if for just a moment. *Emily*. The sides of my mouth twitched, and then I was smiling. My chest was alight once more, as she always does to me. I still have the note, and if I have it my way, I’ll be buried with it. 



I called her later that day, and a coffee date turned into another, then a happy hour. It happened naturally, without active thought. The next step was just that, and soon a year passed in an eyeblink. I found myself drinking less, not because she asked me to but because, for the first time in my life, I felt I had reason to experience it. 



I knew the question would arise, eventually, and it frightened me. Emily talked about her parents back east, her father the handyman and her mother the businesswoman. Her older brother, graduated going on three years now, and the family dog. We could never have dogs, but I always wanted one. I expressed my eagerness to meet them, hoping their idyllic existence might occlude my family’s own - that Emily would think I emerged fully formed from that frathouse floor, unburdened. 



This was not to be. The question came after dinner, one night as I was scrubbing grease from a pan. 



“Ben,” she said. Her tone was cautious, almost timid, like I was standing on the edge of a bridge. My heart clenched in a less pleasant way than usual, as if it knew what was coming. She sidled up next to me, peering at me with her emerald swimming pools, and I halted in my task.



“Yeah?”



Her eyes flicked around as if tracking a fly, then the bottled up question burst from her like shaken up soda. 



“I.. I just… when can I meet your family?”



My mouth went dry, like it had on the night we met. I looked into the sudsy sink, wetting my lips, trying to remember the prerendered replies I’d cooked up. *They’re racists. They’re scientologists. They’re dead.* In that moment, all excuses dissolved like rice paper in the rain. I couldn’t lie to her, nor could I tell the truth. As sure as I was that she loved me, and I her, I was equally sure that the truth would end us. 



I stood frozen at the sink, as if my body’s movement affected that of time. My mind was racing, smashed between two impossible choices, until I felt her hand on my back. My face was numb, and I gulped a deep breath. She leaned her head on my shoulder. 



“I’m sorry,” she said softly. “You never talk about them. I know it’s probably… I don’t care if they’re weird, or whatever. They’re your family. They made you.” She squeezed my shoulder. “I have to thank your mom, at least.” 



I thought of my mother, and my guts did an all too familiar inversion. The certainty that Emily would leave washed over me anew, and my hands began to tingle. I wanted to cry, but tears never come when they’re supposed to. I gripped the sides of the sink, commanding my fingers to feel the cold, slick metal. 



“Hey,” Emily’s voice cut through my malaise like a lighthouse beam. I felt her arms encircle my waist, and the sickening tide ebbed at her touch. “Only if you want. No pressure, no pressure. I love you either way.” 



That was true. I knew it to be so, and that certainty was real, unlike the erroneous surety from moments before. I knew Emily to be a great many things, none of them a liar. 



So I agreed. 



I called home the next day, the number unfamiliar and rusty to my fingertips. Dad sounded elated over the phone, because he was. I’d not called in months, and now I was coming by for dinner. Right now. They had a new guest, he said. A six year old boy named Milo. Fresh to the foster system. My brain shuddered to a halt, and I mumbled something along the lines of “good for you.” I hung up as quickly as possible, my stomach impossibly winding into another knot. 



“Ready?” called Emily, and I turned to see her in the door. “I want to get them a bottle of wine, or something.”



My heart was in my throat, blocking bile. My eyes must have said enough, because she swept over to me in an instant. “What’s going on?” she asked. “Is this still okay?” 



God, should I have just told her? No one ever understood me past the age of seven. What if she did understand, then we got there and she didn’t see? I’d look like a lunatic, and then she’d definitely leave. Maybe we’d go, and we’d only see Dad and Milo, and maybe Emily wouldn’t even notice. And we’d never have to see them again. 



“New… kid. They’ve got one,” I finally said. She could tell I wasn’t saying everything, but she nodded. 



“Good for them.”



The drive was quiet, bereft of our usual chatter and jibes. My knuckles were as white as my lips, and Emily sat gazing out the window, contemplating the possible derangements of my family. Whatever she imagined, she was wrong. As I turned onto Hoskins Drive, the mailboxes and driveways became familiar. The turns grew second nature, and suddenly I was moving the gear shift into park, stepping out and beholding my family home. I turned to Emily, and in a panic realized that she, too, was nervous. Of course she was. My own nerves receded as I moved to her, squeezing her hand and offering a half-smile. 



“They’ll love you,” I said, and she grinned.



“I know.”



We hiked up the concrete walkway, bowed with age. I thought I saw a curtain shift in a second-story window, but I forced it from my mind. Reaching the front door, I knocked three times and stepped back. Emily released my hand, which I realized was clammy and probably unpleasant to hold. Sounds behind the door, creaking and shuffling, then it swung open and there was Dad, clutching a featherduster wrapped in freshly swept cobwebs. 



“Hello there!” he beamed, shooing us inside. He wrapped me in a crushing hug, bald head chafing on my stubble. “Oh, Benny, it’s so good to see you. And you must be Emily?” he said, releasing me and clasping his hands before himself. Her surprised eyes flicked to me, then back to Dad as she met his smile with her own. 



“Yes, I am,” she said, and Dad clasped her hand in both of his, shaking it warmly. 



“It is a pleasure to meet you, Miss Emily. Please, please. You’re just in time.” Em shot me a happily incredulous look as we followed him through the nearly spotless hallway. The house smelled of crackling spices, and my knotted stomach rumbled at the aromas wafting from the kitchen. To my surprise, a small boy with dark curly hair was pushing cutlets of chicken around a pan, greeting us with a toothy grin as we entered the kitchen. I stopped for an instant, eyes magnetized to the child. He seemed… normal. How long had he been here?



“Milo,” said Dad as he decanted Emily’s present. “This is my son, Benjamin, and his lovely girlfriend Emily!” Milo waved, then went back to the chicken, dutiful in his task. 



“Good to meet you, Milo,” Em said, sidling up beside the boy. “Whatcha making?”



“Chicken,” Milo replied. Dad handed Em a glass of wine, then brought me one as the pair continued their discussion. He’d not stopped smiling since he’d opened the door, and he looked to me now with warm, saccharine aghastment. 



“She’s great!” he said softly. “What took you so long?”



I looked to him, and wondered how far gone he was. 



“You know what,” I said in an equal tone, glancing to Milo. “Still?”



Dad’s smile didn’t falter, but his eyes leapt away from mine. He shrugged, taking a sip from his glass.



“Lots of abandoned children, unfortunately.”



“Dad,” I said, voice hushed and quick now. “This… God, you can stop this, you know.” I looked around hurriedly. “Send Milo away, and burn down the fucking house. Burn it right down and start over. This can’t…” I lowered my tone to a hiss. “This can’t keep going on.” 



“Chicken’s done,” he said, draining his glass. I watched him gather up Emily and Milo, ushering them to the dinner table and plating their meals for them. It always amazed me how well he could pretend all was well. He believed it a strength, a Churchillian stoicism dividing order and chaos. It would have been admirable, were it not so vile. 



Dinner was delicious, and Emily made no small show of her enjoyment. She got along famously with Milo and Dad, and the three of them carried the conversation long into the evening. Mom was mentioned, and Dad apologized for her absence, claiming she was working late, or out of town, or something. I only caught a glimpse of her as I was gathering up the plates. The door through which we entered was well lit, but the one on the far side was dark, as if it opened into starless night. As I was leaning over the table, reaching for Milo’s dishes, I saw a blacker spot in the threshold. I looked up as it flitted away, only revealing the shadowed outline of a couch and switched-off lamp. I did the dishes without once looking down, eyes roving my periphery. I didn’t see her again. 



“Look, stay the night,” I heard Dad say. “The guest room is untouched. Right around the corner. I’ll make you breakfast.” I whirled around. Em had a rosy glow to her cheeks, and she looked at me with dizzy contentment. I couldn’t help but smile, and unfortunately, both of them took it as acquiescence. 



“We’d love to,” Emily said, and I felt myself straining, wriggling helplessly against the ever-tangling web. Further struggle only hastened the worst, I’d learned, but it was hard to fight the instinct. 



Dad shooed us away from further cleanup, and I ushered Emily down the hallway towards the guest room. It was a time capsule of the bright side of my childhood, adorned with old school and baseball photographs, and various other mementos. Emily fawned over my childhood paraphernalia, cooed at a baby picture on the old desk, then promptly fell asleep facedown on the bed without taking off her shoes. I slipped them off, tucking her in as best I could manage. The room even smelled the same, which brought a confusing mix of comfort and unease. I brushed some hair from Em’s face, then stood, perusing the old bookshelf. *The Two Towers* sat alone, its companions lost to the annals of time. My bookmark was still in place. Chapter Nine. I wondered if I’d ever have the courage to finish. 



There was a creak beyond the door, and I nearly leapt out of my skin. Dad and Milo’s voices drifted from the kitchen, down the hallway. I stared at the bottom of the door as my skin began to crawl. There was another, softer creak, and I remembered that I wasn’t alone, that it wasn’t just about me anymore. I made it to the bed in two strides and stumbled backward onto it, one hand on my snoring partner, as the door eased slowly open. 



My back went cold. All the air left the room as I stared at the figure looming in the hallway, peering at me, motionless, mouth twitching. 



“Mom,” I said hoarsely.



At my voice, she crept soundlessly into the room, dinner plate eyes like six inky voids. She occluded the doorway, and the room seemed to bow toward her in deference as her swollen abdomen followed the rest of her. Her eight huge, thinly haired legs padded lightly across the carpet, belying her size and strength. As ever, I picked her two largest eyes to focus on. The four beneath were as unblinking as the rest. Her furry mandibles worked, rubbing together like a fly’s legs, making a soft *shh, shh* sound. I could barely see her fangs glinting in the lamplight. 



“That’s enough,” I tried to say, but my throat was too dry, and the words came out a rattling rasp. Mom had slowed to a crawl, but she did not stop, two fathoms away now. “Stop!” I yelled, and she froze. Emily made a soft, sleepy grunt. My body wracked with spasms as if I’d been thrown in a snowbank, but I kept a hand on Emily and my eyes on Mom’s many. I felt my constellation of pinprick scars burn at her presence, as if the venom still flowed into me. I remembered the sticky feeling of her webs, how they seemed stronger than steel, how I could barely breathe while wrapped in her cocoon. The venom slowed time, making moments seem like hours, letting you analyze every heartbeat in agonizing detail. Letting you comprehend the sour stuff working through your every vein, winding through your heart and back out. She’d feed from different spots. So as not to cause undue damage, maybe, or because I tasted better that way.



I pushed to my feet, fear lighting a black fire beneath me. I was breathing hard and fast, full and hot. I felt removed from my body as I raised a finger toward Mom’s eyes, my voice like a different person’s, someone strong and sure.



“If you touch her, or the boy,” I said, leaning as close as I dared. “I will fucking kill you.”



Her mandibles shifted, and I could see the finger length spines clearly now, light glinting off that unmistakable sheen. I could smell the venom, cloying with a hint of musk. I was immobilized, still as if Mom had stuck me right then and there. If she’d pushed me aside and begun to spin up Emily, I could have done nothing but watch. Instead, one of Mom’s front legs moved slowly, deliberately towards me. I waited, knowing it wasn’t a strike but tensed all the same. Softly, the tickling tip of her leg touched my cheek, caressing down to my jaw. I would have flinched, if I could. It was all I could do to squeeze my eyes shut. 



When I opened my eyes, she was gone, nary a creak betraying her departure. The room still stank of venom, maybe even more now, and my stomach turned. I sprinted from the bedroom and down the hall, collapsing over the toilet with a mostly dry retch. Still tasted better than the fangs. When I was done, I heaved to my feet and walked back to the guest room, anxious to get back to Em. I’d decided that I’d stay up through the night, and Em could drive us back in the morning. I’d tell her I had insomnia, that it was a fine visit, and that we didn’t need to do it again. I found her in the same unconscious sprawl, and a cursory check revealed no bite marks. I breathed a sigh of relief, crawled in bed next to her, and kept my eyes locked on the doorway. 



I awoke a few hours later. The red lights on my old alarm clock showed 3:29 AM. In that moment, I was five years old again. Every shadow was a dangling leg, a crouching abdomen. The pressure on my bladder was enormous, but I fought nature’s call for as long as I could stand, unwilling to venture into the black and leave Emily alone. Eventually, it became clear that I was going to go one way or the other, so I sprang from my bed and into the bathroom once more. Afterwards I stumbled back to my room, crawled into bed and threw my arm across an empty mattress. 



My breath caught in my throat. All remnants of sleep evaporated as I frantically groped the bed, desperate that maybe she’d just rolled over. I turned on the lamp to see an empty room.



“Oh shit,” I said under my breath. “Oh, shit, shit, shit.” I fumbled in my jacket and grabbed my lighter. I tore through the darkened house, checking the living room, kitchen and foyer, every empty room dropping my stomach a level deeper. I came to a halt in the house’s entryway, breathing heavily, when I realized that there was only one place she could be. I looked to the darkened staircase, and the tattered, freshly stepped-on webs.



“Benny?” came Dad’s voice from the hall. “Ben, is that you?”



I flicked on the lighter and, steeling myself, ascended the staircase. The wood beneath the carpet groaned, unused to the touch of human feet. Photos lined the walls, cast in the stuttering ghoulish glow of my lighter, frames rimmed in webbing like crypt-borne relics. Eight year old me, smiling dead-eyed in my pinstripe catcher’s uniform. A class group photograph, thicker webs occluding all but my face. I wasn’t smiling in that one. Towards the top of the staircase, there was a sepia-tinged picture of Dad, proudly brandishing his foster license. He still had hair, dark and wavy in the wind, and he wore his trademark face-splitting grin. Even in the dark, I could see his eyes were different. They smiled with the rest of him. 



As I reached the top of the staircase, I let out a moan of relief. Emily was shambling down the webbed hallway, head and shoulders slumped. Through the panic, I’d entirely forgotten that she sleepwalked. The fear left me all at once, which was stupid, but in my addled state the threat had fled. She was here, she was alright. I put my arms around her shoulders and guided her back towards the staircase.



“Yellow pig tails,” she muttered. I maneuvered her around a thick knot of cobwebs, keeping my lit lighter safely away from her shoulder. The webs were everywhere, like a contiguous wallpaper and carpet. It was never this bad when I lived here. She’d expanded her domain, and I wondered how long until she corrupted the rest of the house. 



As we approached the top of the stairway, something caught my attention. The house was quiet, our footfalls silenced by the ubiquitous spiderwebs. The weeping was soft, but clear and unmistakable. I remembered that sound, remembered making it myself. My heart began its thundering dance once more, and I turned, still holding Emily. The door at the far end was less webbed than the others, a vacant swath before it where it had swung back and forth. Even from here, I could just make out the hand painted letters on the door, faded but legible.



*BEN’S. KEEP OUT.*



“Benny?” 



My head snapped down the stairway. It was Dad, rubbing his eyes and peering up at us. “Ben, what’s wrong? What are you doing?”



“Come here,” I said, forcing full breaths. Dad didn’t move. “Come here, now,” I snapped, and Emily mumbled something incoherent. Dad looked down, then took a tentative step.



“Faster,” I said, looking back toward my old room. When I reached him, I gingerly guided Emily into his waiting hands.



“What-” Dad began.



“She’s sleepwalking,” I said, looking at her glazed eyes and brushing her hair from her face. “Get her back to bed. Don’t talk to her.”



“Benny, you can’t be up here,” said Dad. 



“Get her to bed,” I said over my shoulder. My feet kicked up clots of cobwebs as I strode by doors and end tables draped in silky thread, like corpses in bride veils. Knowing where Mom was brought simultaneous comfort and dread. My palm was slick around the lighter as I reached my bedroom, staring for a moment at my name. Writing it was one of my first memories. Dad holding me aloft so I could reach. Had it started then? Before, or after? I didn’t have many memories from my childhood, and even fewer good ones. When Dad picked me up, showing me how to move the brush to make the letters, I hadn’t felt small. 



Now, staring at the chipping paint, I wondered if I’d ever feel that way again. 



The door swung open with little effort, and I brandished my lighter like a blazing sword. The room seemed to drink in the light, and I couldn’t even see the walls. The weeping stopped as soon as I’d entered, and I swung my lighter around fervently. 



“Milo? Hey, Milo? It’s Ben. I’m here.”



There was a long, deep silence. 



“Benjamin?” 



Milo’s voice came from the corner, weak and reedy. I walked toward it, then tripped on something, almost sprawling to the ground. I lowered my lighter, and nearly dropped it. An oblong mass of webs was plastered to the old wooden floor, like a cotton candy death shroud. I groaned, fresh chills running down my back, and stepped carefully around it. “Benjamin?” came Milo’s voice again. He was propped in the corner, and my throat caught. His head was visible from the top of the cobweb cocoon. His skin was pale, his eyes fluttering, but he was alive. I dropped to my knees beside him, lighter slipping from my fingers as I tore at the webs strung tight around his body. They came away like tissue paper, and I wondered if they’d always been so easy to remove. 



“What’s happening?” Milo asked as I freed him from the remaining webs, scooping him into my arms. I hoisted him up, barely noticing the fire beginning to spread across the floor, dry webs catching in moments. 



“Nothing,” I said softly, turning to the door. “It’ll be-”



My feet froze with my words. Mom was crouched above the threshold, eyes glittering with the creeping flames. Her legs were bunched. Her mouth was motionless. I knew that stance, and she knew that I knew. My legs wouldn’t move, but my fear seemed to stop at my waist. 



“What did I say?” I growled. Mom didn’t move a hair. I clutched Milo tighter, and he buried his face deeper my chest. “I said I’d kill you.”



The flames were licking closer, closer now, but I didn’t feel the heat. I remembered the only time I’d ever fought her off, wielding a lighter I’d stolen from a gas station. Violent pride swelled in my chest. Dad had taken it away, chastizing my sin, but it was the only time I’d made her run. I stared my sharpest daggers at the spider that was my mother, rage of three different sorts compounding within me. I hated that I’d brought Emily here, exposing her to a monster. I hated that Dad was still letting this happen, after all these years.



And, most selfishly of all, I hated that it had taken me this long to say anything other than nothing.



The crackling cobwebs wafted dusty smoke into my nostrils. If it had been only me and Mom, I might have stood there for the rest of my life, staring her down as the flames took us both. But Milo urged my feet forward, closer to the door. I swallowed hard, each step like dragging my feet through liquid lead. I was five steps from the door, then three, then Mom towered above the two of us like a terrible stormcloud, apt to burst at a moment’s notice. As I passed beneath her, I finally dropped my gaze, looking now down the hallway and toward our salvation. I felt no stinging bite, only the cobwebs and Milo’s weight. 



I made it two paces down the hall when I noticed the specks. 



Despite the inferno engulfing my room, the hallway was still inky dark, and so I didn’t recognize them until they were running along the walls. Tiny, black motes expertly skittering along her silky highway. Then I felt one, two, ten pass over my bare feet, and I let out an involuntary cry of alarm. The spiderlings swarmed from my burning room like a spindly tidal wave, rolling over and around my feet and vanishing at the end of the hallway, squeezing through floorboard cracks or chips in the drywall. I felt them squish underfoot as I ran with them, squeezing Milo close and thundering down the staircase. When we reached the bottom, I placed him down and took him by the shoulders.



“Are you alright?” I asked. He didn’t answer. His eyes seemed to stare through me. 



“Ben?” came Emily’s voice. With one hand still on Milo, I turned to see her rubbing her eyes, walking unsteadily towards me. “What’s going on?”



“Pack your stuff,” I said, pulling Milo behind me. “We’re going.”



“What? Why?”



I hadn’t brought more than the clothes on my back. Emily just had her purse and a spare change. I bundled her stuff under one arm, then made for the front door with Milo still in tow. 



“Hey,” Emily said, her tone sharp and harsh, all semblance of sleep gone. “What’s going on?” 



“There’s a fire,” I said, pushing the front door open, the night beyond an open, welcoming invitation. “Come on.”



Emily perked up at this, striding past me and Milo. “Oh my god,” she said. “Where’s your dad? Is your mom home?”



I glanced one last time into the house where I grew up. My eyes were drawn to my father’s, glittering at me from the dark staircase. I couldn’t see the rest of his face, just his eyes, but they betrayed neither sadness nor rage. I don’t know what they said. And I don’t care to. 



We piled into the car, and I was turning down the road before Emily had time to ask what I was doing, why we were leaving, what had happened to my parents. Her voice grew in fervor, panic in her tone, but I felt awash in a comforting haze. She was safe. Milo was safe. Mother’s children, her true children, had abandoned her. And any minute now, I thought as I looked in the rearview mirror, that vile spider’s den would go up in flame, scouring away everything that had come before. 



Any minute, now. ",2,1761984832.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
