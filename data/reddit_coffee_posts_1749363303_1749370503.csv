Just landed in your city 2 days ago — I’m a software engineer, rider, and fitness enthusiast exploring the vibe of Pune for the next 15 days. Would love to meet some like-minded folks, chill over coffee, go on spontaneous rides, or just explore good spots around the city.

Not looking for anything formal — just good vibes, real conversations, and maybe a few new friendships. If you’re up for a hangout, ride, or just want to show a newcomer the ropes of Pune life, hit me up!

DMs open ✌️
Let’s make the next two weeks unforgettable.

This might run long. It might feel like a lot. But if you’re someone who feels things too damn deeply, overthinks life during those 2:27 a.m. silences, or just quietly wants something real... something slow, honest, and not just a vibe curated for social media, then maybe this is for you.

Maybe this isn’t a coincidence. Maybe it’s a weird little sign. Maybe this is that leap of faith we've both been avoiding but kinda need.

I don’t think people show up in our lives by mistake.
Some are distractions. Some are detours.
But a few rare ones feel like destinations we didn’t even know we were searching for.
And when they show up, it’s like your soul just whispers, “this. this is what i’ve been missin.”

So hey, 

I’m 26. I’m a doctor.
And no, I’m not gonna diagnose you unless you sneeze in a really suspicious way and my reflex kicks in.

But I’m not just a guy in a white coat. I’m a certified nerd.
Like, not the aesthetic Tumblr-type nerd. The real kind.
I drop Marvel quotes in casual convos, question what timeline we’re even in, and I’m still lowkey mad at how certain movies messed up basic physics.

I fall in love with characters that don’t even exist.
I get stuck thinking about time, death, consciousness, memory, and whether we’re all just walking collections of nostalgia wrapped in flesh.
Sometimes I sit with chai like I’m the main character in a slow detective story, trying to solve a medical case mixed with a metaphysical crisis.
Other times I disappear into deep dives about marine biology, nanotech, or quantum stuff because my brain said, ""dig deeper bro, we ain't done.""

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a little Arabic (barely survival level).
Oh and I’m learning Klingon. Because why the hell not. Curiosity and chaos kinda are my love languages.


---

There’s this voice in my head

Not always nice. Not always soft.
But it pushes me.

It says things like:
Think harder.
Fix what’s broken.
Don’t settle.
Show up. Even when no one else does.

That voice keeps me going.
Not for grades. Not for a resume.
But because I need to understand the world. The people. The pain. The purpose.
From nanotech in medicine to how grief rewires the brain… I need to know.
Because surface-level stuff bores me. Always has.


---

So what am I looking for?

Let’s keep it simple. I want someone real.

Not someone who ghosts for a week and shows up with “hey”
Not someone who starts with “wyd” and ends it with “lol”
Not someone chasing aesthetics but scared of actual connection

I want the long weird convos.
The kind that start with memes and end with life, death, and what our childhood still haunts us with.

Someone who can say “I’m not okay today, can we just exist together for a while” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who sends a lyric because it hit too hard.
Someone who smells something and is instantly back in a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs at dumb memes like a gremlin and then goes dead silent thinking about souls, the stars, and why we hurt the people we love.

You don’t have to be perfect. Just human. Just honest. Just... there.


---

But more than anything right now, I want a study buddy

No, not the “we’ll do one Pomodoro and disappear forever” type.
I mean a real one.

You don’t have to be in medicine. You could be studying architecture, poetry, law, quantum physics, or just figuring out your life.
Hell, you could just be healing. That counts too.

I want someone to sit with, even virtually.
We don't have to talk all the time. We just have to exist in the same digital space while we both work on becoming better versions of ourselves.

Picture this:
Late night grind.
Lo-fi or rain sounds in the background.
Cups of coffee or chai.
That quiet presence that feels like a hug.
And every now and then, a break where we drop the dumbest memes or the deepest thoughts.

We keep each other accountable.
We remind each other why we started.
We check in on tough days.
We say, “hey, you got this. you're not alone.”
We don’t need to study the same topic. Just show up with the same fire. That’s it.

Maybe we start a weird little ritual. Like sending a quote before we begin. Or ending the night with a mini trivia game or a stupid challenge.
Doesn’t matter. As long as we’re growing together.


---

Some things I’d love to do with you outside study hours

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re trading pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, alternate realities
Debate which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad British or Russian accents just for laughs
Send 4 a.m. voice notes when life’s too loud to type
Make dumb inside jokes that no one else gets
Build a little digital home made of shared silences and late-night chaos


---

Just a few confessions

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more times than I should admit
Neuroanatomy got interesting for me because of a throwaway Sherlock line
I’ve been broken, badly. But I always show up
I’ve walked alone, but never stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth
I want someone who isn’t afraid to sit in the silence with me, and still feel connected


---

So if you’re

A lil cracked but still showing up
Empathetic but steel-strong inside
Smart but weirdly soft in ways that count
Funny but carrying some quiet heaviness
Brilliant in your own messy, chaotic way

Then maybe, just maybe, this post makes some sense to you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No cool-guy act.
Just me. Tired. Honest. Still hoping.

So if any part of this made your chest feel warm or your brain go “same”, drop a meme, a quote, a song, a thought, anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with study sessions.
Two nerds in different corners of the world.
Showing up. Holding space. Growing stronger.

Together.

Because we’re all just stories.

Let’s make it a damn good one.

Still trying. Still here.

But more than anything right now, I want a study buddy

No, not the “we’ll do one Pomodoro and disappear forever” type.
I mean a real one.

You don’t have to be in medicine. You could be studying architecture, poetry, law, quantum physics, or just figuring out your life.
Hell, you could just be healing. That counts too.

I want someone to sit with, even virtually.
We don't have to talk all the time. We just have to exist in the same digital space while we both work on becoming better versions of ourselves.

Picture this:
Late night grind.
Lo-fi or rain sounds in the background.
Cups of coffee or chai.
That quiet presence that feels like a hug.
And every now and then, a break where we drop the dumbest memes or the deepest thoughts.

We keep each other accountable.
We remind each other why we started.
We check in on tough days.
We say, “hey, you got this. you're not alone.”
We don’t need to study the same topic. Just show up with the same fire. That’s it.

Maybe we start a weird little ritual. Like sending a quote before we begin. Or ending the night with a mini trivia game or a stupid challenge.
Doesn’t matter. As long as we’re growing together.

Some things I’d love to do with you outside study hours

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re trading pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, alternate realities
Debate which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad British or Russian accents just for laughs
Send 4 a.m. voice notes when life’s too loud to type
Make dumb inside jokes that no one else gets
Build a little digital home made of shared silences and late-night chaos

Just a few confessions

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more times than I should admit
Neuroanatomy got interesting for me because of a throwaway Sherlock line
I’ve been broken, badly. But I always show up
I’ve walked alone, but never stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth
I want someone who isn’t afraid to sit in the silence with me, and still feel connected

So if you’re

A lil cracked but still showing up
Empathetic but steel-strong inside
Smart but weirdly soft in ways that count
Funny but carrying some quiet heaviness
Brilliant in your own messy, chaotic way

Then maybe, just maybe, this post makes some sense to you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No cool-guy act.
Just me. Tired. Honest. Still hoping.

So if any part of this made your chest feel warm or your brain go “same”, drop a meme, a quote, a song, a thought, anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with study sessions.
Two nerds in different corners of the world.
Showing up. Holding space. Growing stronger.

Together.

Because we’re all just stories.

Let’s make it a damn good one.

Still trying. Still here.

We’re two couples in our mid-30s heading to Ibiza and looking to make the most of the trip. Below is our current plan—do you have any recommendations or suggestions?

Friday, 13/06 (arriving late)
• Night: Pikes

Saturday, 14/06
• Day: Beach club
• Dinner: Boodiou
• Night: Black Coffee at Hï

Sunday, 15/06
• Day: Experimental Beach Club
• Dinner: Laylah
• Night: ANOTR at UNVRS Club
(We’re opting for ANOTR over Solomun, thinking it might be less crowded—we’ve seen Solomun a few times over the last decade.)

I used to start with hey, how are you doing but apparently people told me it doesn't work and it never did. Then I started commenting on maybe little things on their profile or asking about something in their profile and I think it has only ever worked once where I spoke with her for 3 days and as you guessed it, I got aired again. But usually even the little comments and questions I make about their profile doesn't get me past anything when they answer the question. I usually try to inquire about their hobbies trying to get to know them but that's where I get aired. I forgot to add as well because I've never dated so I also used to ask to meet for coffee or a drink because I obviously suck at texting but, you guessed it, I got aired or if I did get a response it would be a flat out no which now I'm hindsight is understandable as they don't know a thing about me but then again I don't get any interaction at all and wondering what I can do to change that.

This might run long. It might feel like a lot. But if you’re someone who feels things too damn deeply, overthinks life during those 2:27 a.m. silences, or just quietly wants something real... something slow, honest, and not just a vibe curated for social media, then maybe this is for you.

Maybe this isn’t a coincidence. Maybe it’s a weird little sign. Maybe this is that leap of faith we've both been avoiding but kinda need.

I don’t think people show up in our lives by mistake.
Some are distractions. Some are detours.
But a few rare ones feel like destinations we didn’t even know we were searching for.
And when they show up, it’s like your soul just whispers, “this. this is what i’ve been missin.”

So hey, 

I’m 26. I’m a doctor.
And no, I’m not gonna diagnose you unless you sneeze in a really suspicious way and my reflex kicks in.

But I’m not just a guy in a white coat. I’m a certified nerd.
Like, not the aesthetic Tumblr-type nerd. The real kind.
I drop Marvel quotes in casual convos, question what timeline we’re even in, and I’m still lowkey mad at how certain movies messed up basic physics.

I fall in love with characters that don’t even exist.
I get stuck thinking about time, death, consciousness, memory, and whether we’re all just walking collections of nostalgia wrapped in flesh.
Sometimes I sit with chai like I’m the main character in a slow detective story, trying to solve a medical case mixed with a metaphysical crisis.
Other times I disappear into deep dives about marine biology, nanotech, or quantum stuff because my brain said, ""dig deeper bro, we ain't done.""

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a little Arabic (barely survival level).
Oh and I’m learning Klingon. Because why the hell not. Curiosity and chaos kinda are my love languages.

There’s this voice in my head

Not always nice. Not always soft.
But it pushes me.

It says things like:
Think harder.
Fix what’s broken.
Don’t settle.
Show up. Even when no one else does.

That voice keeps me going.
Not for grades. Not for a resume.
But because I need to understand the world. The people. The pain. The purpose.
From nanotech in medicine to how grief rewires the brain… I need to know.
Because surface-level stuff bores me. Always has.

So what am I looking for?

Let’s keep it simple. I want someone real.

Not someone who ghosts for a week and shows up with “hey”
Not someone who starts with “wyd” and ends it with “lol”
Not someone chasing aesthetics but scared of actual connection

I want the long weird convos.
The kind that start with memes and end with life, death, and what our childhood still haunts us with.

Someone who can say “I’m not okay today, can we just exist together for a while” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who sends a lyric because it hit too hard.
Someone who smells something and is instantly back in a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs at dumb memes like a gremlin and then goes dead silent thinking about souls, the stars, and why we hurt the people we love.

1l66ywt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1l66ywt/so_what_are_you_in_to/,"So, what are you in to?","I remember when i lived in the SW part of america. I was just starting my career. I was a year or two out of college. I thought i was living the dream. Had a small condo, made pretty good money, exercised at least 5 days a week. My social life was active and fun. But i drank very consistently, every day after work, and most definitely on the weekends. I was never into hard drugs such as coke, and heroin, but acid, and ecstasy were definitely on the table.

I met this one girl that was different. I remember she asked me did i always need to drink? I said no, it's just fun, i like it.

I'll never forget her response. She said, i like to drink too, but, i know how to enjoy myself without alcohol, do you? 

That took me for a spin, i didn't really know how to answer her. I mean the easy answer was, pppffhh, of course i do, but at the time, i was just like, i don't think about it, i just like to have fun. 

Well, after a few years, more than a few bad decisions, and a disastrous performance at a company that led to me getting fired and re-thinking my life, i still think about that question. 

Of course, now i can answer that question with an unequivocal yes. Yes, i can enjoy life without alcohol. 

Why this post? 

I know many are struggling with sobriety. It liken it to growing pains. I know, i went through it myself. Although, my problems are different, i can understand that one. I've gone through having to re-define myself before. 

I pose this question for some of the people that are struggling with finding things to do with your sobriety. 

Imagine you meet the person of your dreams. They are literally what you have dreamed of. Guys, girls, whoever is your fantasy person. Imagine your in a coffee shop, or bookstore, grocery store, whatever. 

You catch each others eyes, and say hello. Now, this is the question. 

So hey, what are you into? 

That's it. You see, because whatever you answer, that is what you're into and can develop. That can be your spring board to your new life. 

I highly doubt anyone will say, well, i just sit at home and moan and complain. Shit, if it were me, I'd make something up and then get good at it. 

But, you see my point? There is something, we all want to do, even if we don't know what it is. There is a curious, wonderful person waiting for us to say hello, that person is us. The person we were before alcohol. 

The person that had dreams, goals, plans. The person that was naturally entertained. That person that was spontaneous, fun, happy. That person is still there in all of us, if we just take the time to say hello. 

So tell me, what are you in to?",1,1749370010.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

Nikiwa pale second year busy minding my business a guy approached me asking for directions to a certain office

 Mimi na roho yangu safi and always doing the most and everything except studying decide to take him there .Small talk here and there (btw small talk hukuwa job ubaya ni hailipangi)  anyway after that he says thank you and since I'm nice he would like us to go on a coffee date to say thank you.So I would like to make it clear HE approached me!! Anytime nimekuwa L's they approach me I have neverrrrrrrrr approached a man 

Anyway first forward we met nikaingia box Na nikajifungia and those we the best 3 or 4 months  of my life nilikuwa naletewa Adi KFC Shule maisha fitty tutakaa ivi After 3 months nikaanza  kushangaa this man has never invited me to his place we are always   outside or he comes to school we just chill in his car .He was around 27 . cause Mimi nakaa home .but I didn't think it was sus until my sister pointed it out that he was doing so many nice things without asking for anything in return  as we all know hakuna cha bure Labda kondiko za trust😂

Ikafika point I start insisting.He agrees we set a date ata siwezi Sahau it was a Thursday cause I didn't have classes .Tukafika we are chilling those 5 mins za kujifanya like you both don't know Nini imewaleta apo yk but something seemed off at this house .it looked like a family house typical Kenyan house with even a small crib outside for the sons yk .and something else caught my attention kulikuwa charts za abc and ofcourse I ask akaniambia Ni juu the sister was around and she has kids they were using Na juu Mimi Na mbuzi hakuna tofauti nikakubali .

We’ve had an all round healthy relationship, we only really fought about important things three or four times over the entire course of the relationship and I felt like I could rely on him and he could rely on me. And having come out of a relationship with a girl that thought conflict resolution meant throwing you against a wall, having someone I could be vulnerable was an unexpectedly needed part of my life.

The last couple of weeks I’ve been pretty mentally unhealthy, depressed, anxious etc. mostly to do with my finances, I was trying to make it as a free lance artist for a while, and whilst it was making a bit of money, it just wasn’t feasible. Anyway, I’ll admit that I neglected the relationship a bit whilst I was down, but I was focusing on trying to get myself a real job that could pay me regularly. Through all this, I was definitely a bit distant, but no more than I have been other times when I got busy with my freelance work. 

But things were looking up, we’d talked about feeling the distance between us and we both made more of an effort to make time for each other, and I thought it was all going far better than it had for a while. We were having coffee the morning after he’d come over to stay the night and he seemed really out of it, after some pushing he just drops it on me that he wants to break up, or at least take a break for a bit. I did my best to stay calm, and I feel like we ended the conversation on good terms, but I just can’t shake the feeling that there’s something I’m missing here.

He said that he didn’t feel the spark anymore, and that he needed some time alone because he hadn’t been single for a long time and wanted to figure out what he wanted, but said he still loved me.

I’m getting the worst mixed signals from him, i just feel blindsided by the very abrupt end to what I thought was a happy relationship, we’d known each other for coming up to two years, and it mightn’t seem like a whole lot, but I’d hoped we could have figured out what we wanted together. I didn’t realise how much of my day was centred around him, opening Instagram, and going to send him reels I find funny and think he’d like, or a message I’d want to send him about my day, so much makes me think of him and now everything we used to find joy in together stings. He used to love the birds that hung out in the trees near the shops, and when stray cats crossed our paths he was transformed into a pile of mush trying to psst psst it closer, I love the way his face always showed exactly what he was thinking and how he hated I could always tell.

Let me start off by saying - my ""fetish"" is feeding people. I'm always at my happiest when I can have people over and make pizzas, or for a BBQ, or to make brisket, or what have you. I'm super extroverted and also love taking care of people, so feeding large groups of people fits that like a hand in a glove.

I enjoy coordinating large events within our friend group. There's about 12-15 families, parents where our kids go to school together (several different grades), and on holidays or weekends we'll sometimes do things together as well.

On spring break we went together to a park with a little brook in it, and I did a BBQ for over 50 people, with a menu suited for both the parents and the children. I was manning two coal grills for 90 minutes by myself, but everyone ate, and they ate WELL. Coupla weeks ago 8 families went camping for the weekend, and I had organized dinner, breakfast and snacks for everyone - down to preparing foil-wrapped potatoes to cook in the bonfire that night and cookies to have with the coffee in the morning.

Because everyone knows what I can do and what I'm capable of, they're all very happy to get out of the way and let me do my thing. Logistics and food are set up flawlessly, everyone has a good time, win-win situation. At the end of the event I'll send everyone an Excel sheet with a breakdown for costs with EVERYTHING listed and they'll send me money to cover their parts. 

Here's the thing though - every single item on the list that I send out has a hidden markup, everything is listed as costing more than it actually does. At the end of the day, I calculate everything so that my family's part in paying for everything is covered by the rest of the group. For example, if we're 5 families getting together and everything ends up costing $150, or $30 per family, I'll send a breakdown that shows that everything ended up costing $180, or $36 per family. I'll get sent $144 from the other four families, and I'll end up not paying or only paying a few dollars or something small like that.

I consider it my ""fee"" for doing all the organizing and logistics work for everyone, even though I love doing it. Because I share the Excel chart at the end, no one has ever challenged me on actual costs, and my family and I end up eating for free. For me that's the real win-win situation - I get to feed people, and me and mine get to eat for free.",4,1749369616.0,confessions,1,1.0,False

So to start I work in a company that is very physically demanding and a few months ago I got rejected for the tryouts for this one specific position I was trying to get. That was unfortunate but I wasn’t gonna let that stop me, as there’s always something good on the way (atleast that’s what I thought back then). Anyways after that happened I was having a rough time at the end position they put me in ( in my company if you don’t make that position  I tried to get  they end ip just sending you to whatever they need you to do) because as much as I thought that I needed to make the best of my situation I was also pissed that I didn’t make the cut for my dream position. As time passed I’d go hang with my buddies and I wasn’t really paying attention to the world around me and I would miss hints or even straight up flirting I’d receive from strangers, my friends started to pull my leg about how much I “fumbled “ because of that. Anyways me and my buddies got transferred to a new location, and I ran into this gorgeous woman there my age and we started talking because I had trouble closing a door to a shuttle we were both on. We started seeing eachother soon after and even though we didn’t intend to we started dating. This was probably the best feeling I had since I failed to get that position. I would be at this girls house so often that i temporarily moved in for a bit as it was closer to my job. We would do everything together she started to cook more instead of just making whatever microwave dinner she had as she wanted to do things like that for me. We started going to her church.Things were good. Unfortunately my partner had to move due to some unforeseen circumstances, but things were working out we still tried to see each other and things were still good. Until one day I am told my grandmother was diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer and she had very little time to live and unfortunately I couldn’t make it back home in time, she ended up having a stroke on top of all that and died. I was devastated , but I also knew that she wouldn’t have wanted me to be hung up over it and she would’ve wanted me to see the good in it. That being that she was very old and tired of living that same day to day life and was happy to pass. Unfortunately a little while later I found out my mom had cheated on my dad a second time. That sucked to hear because I always tried to see my family asgood leaning people. It also suck because as much as I loved my partner she had been acting weird as well and having that felt like a sign, but I wanted to trust her. So I did. I called her up and I asked to meet her at her place because k had alot to talk to her about. When I got to her place I texted her and she told me she was at a friends apartment in the same complex , so I went over by that place to go and grab here which she was shocked by. I will be honest and say that I thought to maybe not tell her and just wait until he left his please to make sure she wouldn’t do anything unsavory on the way out , but I instead decided I should trust her as I didn’t want to unfairly project what I saw in my parents relationship onto mine. We then went back to my place as she then proceeded to lay on her bed staring at her ceiling kinda just disassociating from life as i told her what i had going on. She didn’t even seem to care a little bit. 
Fast forward her mom invited us over for a holiday weekend and wanted me to meet the rest of her family as I did. One of the days I was at her moms house I picked up my partners phone and was about to look something up. Me and her always had an open phone policy and never before had either of us had any issues with it. It was started by mutual agreement as I didn’t have the best past but I wanted to show this woman that I was no longer that person. When I picked up her phone she freaked out on me saying I can’t be going through her phone or anything like that, which wasn’t even my intention but I put down her phone and apologized, she later explained the freak out by telling me her mom didn’t like that I picked up her phone. I wanted to shrugged that off but the behavior was just so weird for her, and on top of what I learned about my mom and how my dad found out ( he saw a bunch of messages on a smart watch my mom left when she went to work when he was working from home) I wasn’t feeling the best about it so I planned to check her phone when the time presented itself later that day. Unfortunately that time didn’t come that day as we were watching her niece and nephew. Throughout the day I saw messages pop up on her phone from this friend but I couldn’t ever see what it was as she had notifications locked. The end of the weekend comes around and the past night had been a mess a family fight happened and she had to get involved. She came back inside and we went to bed. The next morning I woke up before her to her work alarm going off so I picked up her phone and turned it off. Realizing that I had my chance to get the reassurance that I was just over thinking and that me and her would be alright. I took her phone to the bathroom and went though the chats she had with her friends including the guy who she’d text all the time and a few from a place she once lived. The guy from the place she used to live had a drunk text from her saying that she “missed them” as a couple and the texts with the guy friend she works with and was hanging out with that day I went to see her ( and most days we didn’t hang out ) had texts like “you are buying coffee today “ and my “insides hurt “ and “it’s because you’re so big “ and that fucken destroyed me I say in that bathroom taking pictures of all of these texts using my phone so she wouldn’t see any screenshots I could’ve missed deleting. I went outside that bathroom and accidentally work her up when I went back to our room. I think told her k was going on a walk. On my walk I called my dad and told him everything hoping to find answers as he was Also going through this pain. It kinda helped . An hour into my walk my partner texts me asking me to come back but I tell her I’m busy, 15 minutes later I run into her on the road and have to end my phone call. She asks me what’s wrong and I struggle to sound normal while telling her nothing as I didn’t want to cause trouble and then have to find my own way back as her family insisted on picking us up. I looked up cabs that could take me and saw there were a few close by but they were very expensive, at that time I didn’t really care as the feelings I had bottled up inside seared my insides like they were molten metal and I needed to get them out at any cost. So when she asked again I asked her if there was anything that she needed to tell me, she said no. I then asked if any of the times she was drinking with her friends if there was anything weird that  happened, she again said no, then k stopped in the road and asked her by id she had slept with her friend bh name, which she also replied no. I called her out on her bullshit and told her I saw the texts and she burst out in tears and I just ripped into her. Never before have I insulted a partner meaningfully like that and I felt terrible about it but it was the way I felt. She told me it mean nothing and all the cliches. I asked for her phone and questioned her about how many times it happened which she lied to me and said twice, after a while I noticed that dates didn’t line up and that she was lying to me. It happened four times including on my brothers birthday and the night before we went to her parents place. She cried on the way back claiming to be sad that she can no longer have a life for me. And I’m embarrassed to say that I tried to make things work but she refused but also acted like she wanted to. She claimed she knew that we wouldn’t work out after that happened and that I’d never trust her and that if I hadn’t found out we would’ve been fine bc she stopped him the night before she came to her moms place. I’m sure there were more times or more people she flirted with as on a call after we broke up (one of the times to tried to mend us ) she told me there’s more but she won’t tell me. I was devastated and I missed her but I was hurt because how was I not enough. Time went by and my mom notifies me that she had a brain tumor and I’m the only one that knew. She made me medical power of attorney. Well it’s been a bit and we now know the tumor is a lot bigger and more solid than we thought. It’s on the brain stem and around the Carotid. I’m worried that she won’t make it though the surgery. 

Eveywhere I look I hear about failing,unfaithful, or unfulfilling relations or death or grief or failure and I never hear of any good anymore. It seems like ever since I grew up everything sucks now and happiness, beauty, and love are lies or distant memories of a time long gone.

1l66m1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l66m1y/should_i_quit_my_job/,should I quit my job?,"Hi everyone! I need help. The title kind of says it all. I recently started a new full-time job and was in training for two weeks—then I got Covid right before starting my third week. Now, I’m really not looking forward to going back.

The commute is rough. I don’t drive, so I have to take a public bus to a stop where the job provides a shuttle to get to the workplace. It’s about 20 minutes by car, but with all the transfers and wait times, it feels like forever. On the way back, I’ve been taking Lyfts instead of the bus because I’m too drained and honestly just don’t feel safe taking public transportation at night.

When I got hired, I was told it was full-time, which I was fine with—but now they’ve got me working 10-hour shifts instead of 8. At first, the “training schedule” was 9 AM to 6 PM, and sometimes I was even told I could leave early because there wasn’t much for me to do. But once I stayed the full shift, they suddenly started scheduling me into the evening and night shifts. I asked them and made it clear to them in paper aswell what I wanted my schedule to be, and they give early in and leave early shifts BASED ON SENIORITY which I find it to be COMPLETE BS. I’m one of the only ones that takes the shuttle.. so I can’t be leaving late. I told them all of this in person and in email before I got covid, and they still scheduled me at night like this so I’m assuming they refused. Like why even ask me what schedule I want if you won’t listen? 

I work a desk job and the work itself isn’t bad. It’s chill, we have access to vending machines, a soda fountain, even a little coffee shop in the building and a lit cafeteria. But that does not make up for the long commute and crazy hours. They never made the schedule expectations fully clear when I got hired. I thought full-time meant a standard 8-hour shift, not this.

They did give me an extra day off, now I have 3 instead of just 2.. but the cons outweigh the pros. I don’t feel safe leaving late, especially with the commute. My dad’s been driving me when he can to work because he sees how exhausting it’s been for me—and I help my family with bills, so he’s trying to return the support. Even my family is encouraging me to quit at this point because they see the hassle I go through. I obviously knew the commute and agreed to it, but the scheduling is not it. 

I know I just started, but between the long commute, the unplanned 10-hour shifts, and the late-night scheduling, it’s just not feeling worth it. I agreed to full-time, not this. I’m seriously considering leaving.

My boyfriend isn’t supporting this, he wants me to stay with a job and save money for us to move out while I think I should quit and find a part time job OR full time job that gives me reasonable hours with reasonable schedule nearest to me, that wouldn’t be a hassle for me to get to.

1l66lpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1l66lpq/what_about_this_interaction/,What about this interaction,"I had an interaction I don’t quite understand with my ex FA. A few days ago, she breadcrumbed me for the third time in the past four months. She sent the classic “hey, what’s up.” I told her it was interesting that she reached out, because I had actually been in her town recently for some errands. She replied that if I was there, I should’ve invited her for a coffee.

I answered a few more surface level questions she asked, and about the coffee I joked, “haha, you know I don’t drink coffee.” Throughout this short exchange, I didn’t ask her a single question, even though she was clinging to every detail to keep the conversation going.

After she stopped asking anything, I waited a few hours and then texted, “but what about you? How have you been?” She replied dryly, saying she was out in nature enjoying the sun.

After that message, the usual anxiety kicked in, and I wrote to her saying that I’m open to staying in touch from time to time, but only if it’s meaningful ..like a recommendation, an invitation, or even a real thought ..and that I don’t want to keep responding to the breadcrumbs of validation she’s looking for.

She replied instantly saying she just wanted to see how I was doing, that she wasn’t looking for validation, and that she’d write more but has certain fears. (She’s talked about having certain fears every time we’ve interacted since the breakup, but whenever I tried to talk about them to understand, she’d disappear for 2–3 weeks.)

I told her it’s normal to have those fears because I created total chaos after the breakup (typical anxious behavior), and that I carry an inner frustration because I can’t show her there’s nothing to be afraid of.

I also told her I’ve made peace with myself, with her, and with everything that happened ..that I understand our dynamic doesn’t work, but I wish what we had could’ve lasted just a little longer.

1l66hkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1l66hkl/i_went_to_every_speed_dating_event_in_denver/,I went to every speed dating event in Denver.,"I am 37 M and just moved to Denver two months ago. I had no friends and wanted a GF so I signed up for a speed dating event. I loved it so much that I signed up for several more. I have also used Bumble, Tinder, Hitch, and some other apps and this is what I learned about all of it:

**MyCheekyDate**\- I went to three of these events. In total I paired with I think like 5 women. Two of the three events got rescheduled. You vote on the attendees at the end of the event on your phone and if paired the men get an email address and the women get a phone number and email. About a 7/10. Professionally ran, just seemed to cancel often.

**TwoBirdsFit** \- I went to one of these. We walked around a lake. There is a matchmaking program you can use at the end, but in reality its better to just ask for their number there if you want it. It was nice in that it was a workout and not just sitting around. 7/10. Fun but not amazing. I paired with on girl and asked for her number at the end.

**Figs and Dates** \- I went to one of these. The owner runs the events herself. It was ran well and it was pretty casual. You mark on a piece of paper at the end and she sends the phone numbers of the people you pair with after the scoring is done. I paired with three women there. 7/10

**Pre-Dating Lock and Key** \- I went to four of these. They are held in the back of a bar in the RINO district. You mark on a piece of paper who you want to pair with and they send emails after. For whatever reason I had absolutely horrible luck here and only paired with 1 of the 50 some women I met there. Nothing bad about the venue or event, it just dident go anywhere for me and some of the women I talked to were pretty fucking rude. 5/10.

**Shuffle Dating** \- I went to two of these. These events were different in that there is no host. You all show up to a coffee shop and get instructions via an app. Many of the attendees here were confused and several girls asked me if I was the host. Many people dident seem to understand what was going on. Overall ok. I paired with zero people but overall found the venue to be pretty good. 6/10.

**Jigsaw** \- I went to two of these events. One was a more traditional speed dating in a coffee shop where you sit down and talk to each girl for a few min and then rotate. The other was at Dave and Busters and was more just mingling than speed dating. In both instances the ratio of men/ women was way off with far more men than women. Most of the other programs had fairly even ratio, but not these guys. In the second event it seemed like there were 3x more men than women. There is no matchmaking and you just have to ask for their number. I paired with 3 women in the two events. 6/10

**Unconscious Speed Dating** \- I went to one of these. Up until this point, all the previous companies use fairly similar speed dating techniques where you talk to another person for 5-7 min job-interview style and then just move on. This event was considerably different in that it tries to match people based on unconscious body language and neurological attraction. The host is a doctor and this is kind of more of like a class than just speed dating. He is there to teach you useful communication skills. I paired with one woman. There is no matchmaking program. You just have to ask for their number. Some of my dates were visibly nervous as the class is a bit more intensive than normal speed dating so if you're an introvert you're going to get tested here. 10/10 highly recommend.

**Tantra** \- I went to two these. They are considerably different than other speed dating programs in that they tend to be much more hands-on and they try to build connection. There isint a lot of talking going on and you dont get a chance to ask your partner many questions unless you talk to them before/ after the event. There is a matchmatching program, but the women make the choices. The men have no input. Also, both events had more women than men (+1 and +6 women). I matched with 12 women in these two events and found it to be fantastic. 10/10, best of all the programs.

**Speed Sparks** (online). Canceled the event, wouldn't give me a refund, had to file a charge-back with my bank. 0/10

**The Fun Singles** (online). Advertise as being local, but went three times and did not meet a single person in Colorado. Total scam. 1/10.

Tinder, Hitch and FB Dating I did not meet one single person. Bumble I spoke with 9 women, went on a date with 5.

Overall, I met 150 - 200 women in 60 days, went out on dates with about 20 of them, about 20% came from Bumble and 80% from in-person, but nothing beyond casual encounters developed. I found that a lot of the women were somewhat flaky and seem to like the idea of dating someone, but arnt willing to put in the work to make it happen (or at least, not with me). For example, some of the dates took me weeks of back and fourth texting before we actually met. In the end, I dident really find what I was looking for and I just got back with my Ex-GF instead.

My main recommendations are avoid anything online dating related (outside legit apps like Bumble/ Tinder, ect) as they are just scams and if you see a girl at a dating event you like just ask for her number and dont rely on the matchmaking system to pair you up.

# Essential Tips for Booking Tokyo Hotels

**Book early** for the best rates and availability, especially during peak seasons like cherry blossom time (late March-early May) and autumn foliage (November). Hotel prices can increase 30-50% during these periods, and popular properties sell out months in advance.

**Consider room size carefully**—most Tokyo hotel rooms are significantly smaller than international standards. Look for properties that specify room sizes, and don't hesitate to upgrade if space is important to your comfort.

**Location matters more than amenities** in Tokyo. A hotel near a major JR station (especially the Yamanote Line) will save you time and money on transportation while providing easy access to the city's attractions.

**Check for additional fees** like Wi-Fi charges, breakfast costs, and early check-in fees. Many hotels charge separately for amenities that might be included elsewhere.

**Language support** varies significantly. International chains typically offer more English-speaking staff, while domestic hotels may require translation apps for complex requests.

**Loyalty programs** can provide significant value in Tokyo's expensive hotel market. Consider joining hotel programs before your trip to access room upgrades, late checkout, and other perks.

It even made me question my scientific, rational way of viewing the world back then. I’m not sure if r/spirituality is the right sub for this, but it feels like it fits here.

This happened about 10 years ago, in 2015. I was at a coffee shop with two friends, smoking hookah. I told them I was going to the pharmacy quickly and would be right back. I left and started walking down the street.

A few minutes later, a young girl, wearing a hijab, probably no older than 16, called out to me. Not in a soft or begging way, but in a commanding tone, like she was ordering me to come over. She looked homeless, and back then my ego didn’t like being “ordered” around, especially by someone who seemed to be living on the street.

I told her, “If you want to talk, you come to me.”

Without hesitation, she replied confidently, “Be humble and come here. I want to help you.”

That line hit me in a weird way. Curiosity got the better of me, so I walked over and sat next to her. Without any introduction or small talk, she looked at me and said, “I see people doing bad things to you without your knowledge.” Then she asked for my hand so she could read it.

I gave her my hand, and what she said next completely shocked me. She mentioned the name of my ex, someone I hadn’t spoken to in a long time, and told me that some “lock” had been placed on me by people with bad intentions, specifically to destroy that relationship. Then she said she could remove the lock if I paid her a certain amount. The strange part is, I wasn’t even interested in getting back with my ex at the time.

I assumed maybe she somehow knew both of us and had recognized me, making up a story to try to scam me. But the area we were in was miles away from where me and my ex used to live, so that didn’t really make sense.

I asked, “If you remove this lock, what’s supposed to happen?”

She said, “She’ll come to you.”

I told her, “If that actually happens, I’ll come back and give you the rest of the money.” She agreed. Then, in the strangest move, she pulled out a string and somehow locked it around my wrist. She said some words I didn’t understand, then untied it effortlessly and told me it was done.

I went to the pharmacy, then back to my friends, and I didn’t even mention the story. I kind of forgot about it.

Two days later, I went to visit some friends at the university. I had already graduated and hadn’t been there in a while. Out of nowhere, my ex showed up, literally stood in front of me like a statue, speechless. It was like she didn’t even know why she was there or what to say.

I immediately remembered the girl and what she said.

I talked to my ex briefly, wished her well, then left and rushed back to the place where I met the girl. But she was gone. I asked some homeless women in the area if they knew her. They all said they had never seen anyone like that. I asked a few store owners nearby too. Same response: “We’ve never seen anyone like that here.”

I went back a few more times after that, hoping to find her, but nothing. She vanished. No one had seen her before or after.

Any insights on what this could’ve been? I’m still confused to this day.

TL;DR  
In 2015, a mysterious homeless girl told me someone had cursed my relationship and said she could remove it. She named my ex, performed a ritual, and said my ex would come back. Two days later, my ex randomly showed up after two years of no contact. I returned to find the girl, but no one in the area had ever seen her before or since. I still have no explanation.",9,1749367547.0,spirituality,3,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and functionality of coconut cups can vary significantly depending on the brand and manufacturing process. Understanding the key features is crucial for selecting cups that meet your specific requirements.

**Shell Thickness:** The thickness of the coconut shell directly impacts the cup's durability and heat resistance.

A thicker shell, typically ranging from 4mm to 6mm, provides greater insulation, allowing the cup to handle warm beverages without becoming too hot to hold. Additionally, a thicker shell is less prone to cracking or chipping under pressure. Thin-shelled cups, while lighter, are more susceptible to damage and are generally better suited for serving cold drinks. The ideal thickness depends on your intended use, with thicker shells being preferable for versatile applications.

**interior Finish:** The interior finish of a coconut cup affects its ease of cleaning and overall appeal.

Some cups feature a smooth, polished interior, which prevents food or liquid from sticking and simplifies the washing process. Other cups retain a more natural, textured interior, which some users find aesthetically pleasing but can be more challenging to clean thoroughly. The type of finish also influences the cup's ability to hold certain types of beverages. For example, a highly polished interior is less likely to absorb flavors from strongly colored or spiced drinks.

**Exterior Design:** The exterior design of a coconut cup contributes significantly to its aesthetic value and overall user experience.

Coconut cups come in a variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from perfectly round to more organically shaped designs. Some brands offer cups with handcrafted engravings or intricate carvings, adding a unique touch to each piece. The exterior finish can also vary, with options including natural shell, polished shell, or painted designs. ultimately, the ideal exterior design is a matter of personal preference, but it's critically important to consider how the cup's appearance complements your existing tableware and personal style.**Stand/Base Stability:** The base of a coconut cup plays a crucial role in its stability and prevents spills.

Some coconut cups are designed with a flattened base, providing a stable foundation that allows them to sit securely on flat surfaces. Others feature a small, handcrafted stand made from wood or bamboo, elevating the cup and adding a touch of elegance. The stability of the base is especially important when serving beverages on uneven surfaces or in settings where spills are more likely. A well-designed base can significantly enhance the overall user experience and prevent unneeded messes.

Key features of the best coconut cups include:

* Durable shell construction
* Smooth, food-grade interior finish
* Unique and aesthetically pleasing exterior design
* Stable base or stand for spill prevention

I’m on the hunt for someone who’s effortlessly cool, totally chill, and maybe just the right amount of weird.  I’m looking for a connection that feels natural, fun, and maybe a little unpredictable in the best way possible.I’m the kind of person who jumps into random hobbies with zero hesitation, just to see what sparks joy. One month I’m teaching myself guitar riffs, the next I’m deep into brewing kombucha or trying to master origami (spoiler: my paper cranes look more like paper blobs). I pick things up fast, but I’ll admit I’m prone to getting sidetracked by the next shiny interest that catches my eye. It’s a chaotic process, but it keeps life exciting.

Friends describe me as the laid-back type, and I’d have to agree. I’m all about cozy hoodies, jeans that feel like a hug, and hair that’s got a mind of its own (I call it “organized chaos”). I stand at about 5’11”, weigh around 180 lbs, and have a medium build I'm working on.  Sarcasm is my love language, and I’m always down for clever banter or deep, thought-provoking conversations that sneak up on you. Life’s too short to take too seriously, so I try to keep things light but meaningful.

If you’re the kind of person who loves learning random skills (bonus points if they’re totally useless but fun), trading playful roasts with a side of affection, or just vibing over something hilariously dumb like bad reality TV or niche internet memes, we’d probably get along. Let’s grab a coffee, swap stories about our weirdest hobbies, or just see where the conversation takes us. At the very least, we’ll have a good laugh and maybe a new inside joke or two.

I put we lightly because I am not nearly as close with these girls as her. There are 7 other girls in this group, and my friendship with them stops at right about having lunch with them as a group. I don’t really hang out with them outside of school, but she does often and this is where the issues began.

To give a bit of background, we all just finished our sophomore year of highschool and most of us have minimum wage jobs. The main girl in this group I’ll call Jess(16F) and she’s really close with my bsf another girl who I’ll call Maddie. Jess is pretty wealthy and has two jobs, one of which is at a daycare with Maddie and a couple of other girls in the group. Theres another girl directly involved, who I’ll call Sarah.

Now, onto the main situation, bsf, Jess, Maddie, and Sarah were hanging out today, and Jess offered to drive them as she and Sarah are the only ones with licenses. They decided to go for coffee, and while in line bsf is told that Sarah and Maddie have no money and want her to pay for their drinks. A thing about bsf is that she’s wayyyy too nice to these girls and will pay for them a lot of times. Bsf agrees to buy Sarah a drink, to which Jess begins to get upset and ask for gas money. Jess pays for Maddie’s stuff a lot, because her parents will take money from her account because she spends too much, but she then got frustrated when Maddie asked her to pay for coffee and started asking for money from anyone else in the car. She knew that the other two girls didn’t have money, and she directed the question at bsf. Bsf then agreed, and payed for all four girls when she is also struggling with money. Unlike the other girls, bsf is expected to pay for gas, insurance, and any other wants like new clothes, or food. All three other girls have rich families who will pitch in and buy gas or other things they want, and they were still expecting bsf to pay for them. Obviously, she’s upset with them, and she told me so, but I don’t know how to break it to her that then kind of suck and don’t treat her well at all.

This isn’t the only time we’ve had issues with them. There have been times where they have had plans, and many of them will cancel on her last minute. Also, last month, we were having problems with Sarah and another girl in one of bsf’s classes because they kept taking her phone and using it to text or snap people without telling her and would refuse to give it back when asked. It got so out of hand to where she had to change passwords and hide the phone so they wouldn’t continue to take it even when asked not to.

So Reddit, how do I lightly tell her that these people aren’t good for her. I love her and she knows that I’m not the biggest fan of any of these girls, but they walk all over her and I hate the way they treat her.

Some of us are working for pay.
Some are catching up on work from home — unpaid but necessary.
Some are taking care of their families, making sure the house is clean, meals are prepped, and everyone’s okay.
Some are lucky enough to be resting.

Whatever kind of Sunday you’re having… life continues.
The to-do list waits. Responsibilities pile. Fatigue is real.

But still — the flowers bloom. 

I took this photo yesterday and decided to send it to you all today. It reminded me that even in the middle of our exhaustion, the world keeps offering quiet moments of beauty, if we can just slow down long enough to notice.

Bc this shit feels impossible.

I went 4 full months no contact with my ex. I really thought I was doing great. I wasn’t perfect…. of course I grieved, cried, journaled, spiraled here and there but overall, I felt like I was healing little by little. I even thought I wasn’t in love with her anymore.

Then boom…! we randomly ran into each other at a coffee shop idk whyyy bc this is a HUGE city. I literally never run into anyone, not even neighbors when I go outside, & somehow I keep bumping into the person who ripped me to shreds.

She approached me. I could see the passion and yearning in her eyes all over again, and it caught me so off guard. My whole body got chills & I panicked.

She asked to sit and talk, & my defense mechanism kicked in.
I said, “No. I don’t forget how you cheated on me with your ex-wife.”
And her defense kicked in too… She was pissed & nearly shouted, “Well, what about all the abuse you gave me in turn?”

I said, “I know what I did back. I know what we did to each other, including why it all started. So you need to leave.”
And after throwing a tantrum, she did.

I was so proud of myself for resisting the temptation. But the next day, I wake up to an anonymous message… a long, nasty paragraph from her.

She was like….
“You have some nerve acting all innocent. I really thought that in these four months you would’ve had the balls to look at yourself in a mirror and reflect and grow but clearly you’re in denial still about yourself… and that’s you haven’t called me a narcissist. Anyway, I’m messaging you because just yesterday People said you were talking shit about me & You’re telling people I hit you.”

All of it was false. I hadn’t spoken about her in months & we do NOT have a single friend in common but that was her excuse to get the upper hand. 

Anyway, She blocked me on everything again, of course. No way to respond. Just boom, detonation. Andddd so I spiraled. I couldn’t stop ruminating. I took everything under the sun… ashwagandha, melatonin, Xanax… and I still couldn’t calm down.

The next day, I couldn’t eat, work… I noticed I’d started losing weight which pissed me off bc she has gained 15 very visible pounds of muscle and looks BETTER THAN EVER 😭
Like I cannot keep my eyes off of her she is so sexy to me it’s ruining my life. 

So, broke down and called her crying.
I said, “I had lost hope that you’d ever reach out to apologize for the betrayals. And then you show up, at a random café you’ve never been to, after supposedly moving out of state. I reject you to protect myself, and then you get your ego hurt and send that horrible message?”

We argued back and forth before she half ass apologized, narcissist-style. And there I was, sobbing again and suddenly asking her to meet for breakfast like wtf is wrong with me?

We met. It was all passion, all magnetism again. But I drew boundaries. I told her, “I don’t want to touch.” And to her credit, she respected that.

We’ve been spending the week together, very slowly, but now I’m constantly spiraling again. I’m having panic attacks back to back bc everything I thought was resolved in those four months? Still there. Still potent. I feel like I’m right back at square one.

And the part that fucks with me the most is:
Why do I keep running into her to begin with?
This city is massive. It’s weird. It’s magnetic. It pisses me off.

She told me, “That’s fine, I’ll just cut you off. I’m okay with letting you go. I left the country for a month, did a lot of healing. I met someone else, we didn’t do anything but maybe share a kiss and it wasn’t serious, but I learned that I can move on when needed. And so can you.. & if the best for you is to walk away, I’ll support that no matter how much it hurts me.”

So I’m like… “Then what the fuck was the point of the eye contact, the chills, the softness in your voice when asking to sit & talk? Then blowing up on me when I rejected you as I tried to do what was best for us…? Why come back at all?”

The worst part?
I’m not the one who initiated any of this and yet somehow I’m the weakest one.
The one spiraling. The one sobbing.
The simp.

With all this said….
my real question is, and I mean this with all the emotional exhaustion in my body,
Will I ever truly detach from her?
Will I ever stop finding her attractive, interesting, magnetic?
Will I ever stop being the one who suffers more?

I want to get to a point where I can walk in and out like it’s nothing, where I can look her in the face & feel attraction but not NEED anything at all.
Where I can use her for convenience and then walk away without shaking if push comes to shove.

I left just before the first wave of Covid and was essentially trapped there till the borders opened up. And what a place to be trapped for 3 months. Thankfully my sister stays there so I didn't have to worry about food or accomodations.

I stayed in Helsinki mostly with few days trips to Poorvo and Nuksio national park. Witnessed my first snowfall. Helsinki is like a suburban part of Europe, not  the beautiful classicale, baroque or gothic architecture that usually defines mainland Europe. Full of colourful wooden houses, yatchs at Helsinki harbour and pretty summmer houses.

2. Cherry blossom trees
3. First GOOD coffee
4. Grilled Salmon
5. Sun shining outside at 11PM in June.

He agreed and I started 2.5 (4 doses).  Before I started my 5.0 dose I read here on the subs that making that jump might cause more side effects and injecting in the thigh might help reduce that.

It's a journey many of us dream about, picturing ourselves sipping espresso in a Parisian cafe or admiring the Renaissance masterpieces in Florence. But let's be real, the reality of bridging that vast expanse of sky can be a bit… overwhelming. It’s not just about hopping on a plane; it’s about navigating routes, figuring out layovers, and, perhaps most importantly, finding a flight that doesn't require taking out a second mortgage. This article is your friendly guide, packed with insider tips and practical advice to help you conquer the LAX to Europe journey without losing your mind or your shirt. We'll delve into the nitty-gritty, explore your options, and hopefully, make planning this incredible adventure feel a whole lot less daunting and a whole lot more exciting!

The Great Escape: Planning Your LAX to Europe Odyssey
-----------------------------------------------------

Alright, so you've got that burning desire to see Europe. Maybe it's the call of the ancient ruins, the allure of world-class cuisine, or simply the need for a change of scenery that stretches beyond the Pacific horizon. Whatever your motivation, the first hurdle is figuring out the logistics of getting from LAX to your European destination. It’s a long haul, and getting it right from the get-go can make all the difference between a smooth, enjoyable trip and a chaotic, stress-inducing nightmare. Think of yourself as an intrepid explorer, plotting your course across a vast ocean – except in this case, the ocean is the Atlantic, and your ship is a metal tube hurtling through the air.

### Choosing Your Destination: Where the Old World Beckons

Europe isn't a single entity; it's a vibrant tapestry of countries, cultures, and experiences, each vying for your attention. Deciding where you want to land dictates so much about your trip, from the flight paths available to the type of adventure that awaits you. Are you dreaming of the romantic canals of Venice, the bustling markets of London, the vibrant nightlife of Berlin, or the sun-drenched beaches of the Algarve? Pinpointing your desired landing zone is step one.

- **Western Europe:** Think UK, France, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, etc. Often more direct flight options, but can be pricier. Great for well-trodden tourist paths and iconic landmarks.
- **Central Europe:** Countries like Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary. A fantastic blend of history, culture, and stunning architecture, often offering slightly more budget-friendly options.
- **Southern Europe:** Italy, Greece, Turkey (partially in Europe), Croatia. Rich in history, delicious food, and beautiful coastlines. Can be very popular during peak season.
- **Northern Europe:** Scandinavia, Iceland. Known for breathtaking natural beauty, unique cultures, and often higher costs of living.

Picking your primary destination is like choosing your anchor point for the whole journey. It sets the stage for everything that follows. Don't feel pressured to see everything on your first trip; Europe is vast and deserves to be savored.

### Seasonality and Timing: When to Embark

The time of year you decide to travel from LAX to Europe has a massive impact on everything from flight prices and crowds to the weather and availability of activities. Thinking about peak season, shoulder season, and off-season is crucial for both your budget and your overall experience.

- **Peak Season (Summer: June - August):** The most popular time to visit, and for good reason! The weather is generally beautiful, and everything is open. However, expect huge crowds, higher prices for flights and accommodation, and the need to book well in advance. Think shoulder-to-shoulder at the Colosseum.
- **Shoulder Season (Spring: April - May; Fall: September - October):** Many argue this is the sweet spot. Pleasant weather, fewer crowds than peak season, and often more reasonable prices. springtime brings beautiful bloom and fall offers stunning foliage.
- **Off-Season (Winter: November - March):** Generally the cheapest time to fly and find accommodation. Great for seeing museums and indoor attractions without the throngs. However, some smaller towns or seasonal attractions might be closed, and the weather can be cold and wet in many areas. Think cozy cafes and fewer tourists.

Consider what you want to do and see. If your dream is to wander through Christmas markets, December is your jam. If sunbathing on the French Riviera is the goal, summer is probably best (though expect company). For a balance of good weather, fewer crowds, and better prices, shoulder season is often the winning ticket. This isn't an exact science, of course, but keeping seasonality in mind can seriously impact your trip.

Navigating the Skies: Your LAX to Europe Flight Options
-------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so you know where you want to go and roughly when. Now comes the task of actually getting there. Flights from LAX to Europe are a beast of their own. It’s a long flight, typically ranging from 10 to 15+ hours depending on your destination and whether you have a direct flight or a layover. Understanding the different types of flights and airlines is key to finding the best option for you.

### Direct vs. Connecting Flights: The Time-Saving vs. Budget Balancing Act

This is often the first major decision point when booking a flight from LAX to Europe. A direct flight, as the name suggests, takes you straight from Los Angeles to your European destination without any stops. A connecting flight involves at least one layover, sometimes two or even more.

- **Direct Flights:** The obvious advantage here is speed and convenience. You board the plane in LA and debark in Europe. No worrying about missing connecting flights, navigating unfamiliar airports, or the hassle of multiple takeoffs and landings. The biggest drawback? They are almost always more expensive. Think of a direct flight as the express train – fast and efficient, but you pay a premium for it.
- **Connecting Flights:** These are generally more budget-friendly, sometimes significantly so. They open up more route options and allow you to potentially choose layovers in cities you might be interested in exploring (if time allows!). The downside? They take longer, there's always the risk of delays causing missed connections, and navigating large international airports can be stressful, especially with luggage. Think of a connecting flight as the scenic route – it takes longer, but it might offer some interesting detours and save you some cash.

For a long-haul flight like LAX to Europe, a direct flight is definitely appealing for comfort and minimizing travel time. However, if your budget is a primary concern, a connecting flight is often the way to go. Just be sure to factor in enough layover time, especially if you're connecting through a very large or busy airport.

### The Airline Landscape: Carriers Crossing the Atlantic

A multitude of airlines operate flights from LAX to various destinations in Europe. They range from full-service legacy carriers to budget airlines and everything in between. Each has its own strengths, weaknesses, and, importantly, price points.

1. **Legacy Carriers:** These are your major, well-established airlines like British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France, KLM, and American Airlines, United, Delta (often in partnership with European carriers). They typically offer a higher level of service, including checked baggage in the fare, in-flight entertainment, and meals. Their prices are usually on the higher side.
2. **Budget Airlines:** While pure budget airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet primarily operate within Europe, you might find flights from LAX on carriers that offer more stripped-down service at lower prices. These often charge extra for things like checked bags, seat selection, and even water. Think Icelandair or even sometimes deals on major carriers operating on a budget model for certain routes.

When comparing airlines, don't just look at the base fare. Consider what's included in the ticket price (checked baggage, meals, seat assignments) and factor those in. A seemingly cheaper ticket on a budget airline might end up costing more than a full-service carrier once you add on all the extras. It's like comparing a basic car model to one with all the bells and whistles – the upfront price is different, but the final cost can be surprising.

### Finding the Best Deals: The Hunt for Affordable Flights

Let's face it, flights to Europe from LAX can be expensive. Finding a good deal is often the difference between going on your dream trip and putting it off for another year. There are several strategies you can employ to increase your chances of snagging a reasonably priced ticket.

- **Be Flexible with Your Dates:** This is perhaps the single biggest factor in finding cheaper flights. If you can be flexible with your departure and return dates by even a few days, you can often see significant price drops. Mid-week flights are usually cheaper than weekend departures and arrivals.
- **Book in Advance (but not Too Early!):** Generally, booking a few months out (3-6 months for LAX to Europe flights) is a good strategy. Booking too early can mean you miss out on sales, while booking too last minute will likely result in sky-high prices. It's a bit of a sweet spot.
- **Use Flight Comparison Websites:** Don’t just look at one airline's website. Utilize flight comparison engines like Google Flights, Skyscanner, and Kayak. These sites scour multiple airlines and routes to show you a range of options and prices.
- **Set Price Alerts:** Many flight comparison websites allow you to set price alerts for specific routes and dates. You'll get notified when prices go up or down, allowing you to snatch up a deal when it appears.
- **Consider Alternative Airports:** Flying into a smaller European airport and then taking a train or bus to your final destination can sometimes be cheaper than flying directly into a major hub. For example, flying into Manchester instead of London Heathrow, or into Beauvais instead of Paris Charles de Gaulle. Just be sure to factor in the cost and time of the onward journey.
- **Look at Different Days of the Week:** Flying on Tuesdays and Wednesdays often tends to be cheaper than flying on Fridays or Sundays. Airlines know people like to travel on weekends, so they price accordingly.

Finding a cheap flight from LAX to Europe requires a bit of effort and flexibility, but it's definitely achievable. Think of it as a treasure hunt – the best deals are out there, you just need to know where and how to look!

### The Layovers: Making the Most of Your Stopover

If you opt for a connecting flight, your layover city can either be a tedious waiting game or an unexpected bonus. A long layover can actually be a fantastic opportunity to get a brief taste of another city and break up the long journey.

- **Choose Your Layover City Wisely:** Some airports are more pleasant for long waits than others. Major hubs like London Heathrow, Frankfurt, and Paris Charles de Gaulle can be overwhelming, but they often have good amenities. Consider airlines that route through cities you might be interested in exploring, like Dublin on Aer Lingus, Amsterdam on KLM, or Reykjavik on Icelandair.
- **Plan for Sufficient Layover Time:** Don't book connections that are too tight. A minimum of 1.5 to 2 hours is generally recommended for international connections, especially in large airports. If you're considering leaving the airport for a quick city tour, you'll need much longer – think 6-8 hours minimum, factoring in immigration, security, and travel time to and from the city center.
- **Research Visa Requirements:** If you plan to leave the airport during a layover, make sure you understand the visa requirements for that country, even for a short visit. As a US citizen, you generally get visa-free entry into most Schengen Area countries for up to 90 days, but it's always best to double-check.
- **Utilize Airport Amenities:** Even if you don't leave the airport, make the most of your layover. Explore the shops, find a comfortable spot to relax, or even book entry into an airport lounge for a more comfortable experience.

A layover doesn't have to be a drag. With a little planning, it can be a mini-adventure in itself!

Pre-Departure Prep: Getting Ready for Your LAX to Europe Flight
---------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so you've booked your flight from LAX to Europe – high five! But before you can start dreaming of croissant-filled breakfasts and historic castles, there are a few crucial things to take care of. Being prepared before you even get to LAX can save you a lot of stress and hassle.

### Passport and Visas: Your Golden Ticket (and Maybe More)

This might seem obvious, but it's worth repeating: make sure your passport is valid well beyond your planned return date. Many countries require your passport to be valid for at least six months after your intended departure date. Don't mess around with this; a last-minute rush to get a new passport is not fun.

For US citizens traveling to most European countries in the Schengen Area (which includes a large chunk of Western and Southern Europe), a visa is generally not required for stays up to 90 days within a 180-day period for tourism or business purposes. However, the European Union is introducing the ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) in the near future, which will be a pre-travel authorization similar to the ESTA for the US. Keep an eye out for when this comes into effect; you’ll need to apply and get approval *before* traveling.

For other European countries outside the Schengen Area (like the UK, Ireland, and some Eastern European nations), visa requirements can vary. Always check the official government websites of the countries you plan to visit for the most up-to-date information before you even think about booking your flight. Better safe than sorry, right?

### Packing Smart: Less is More (Usually)

Packing for a trip to Europe from LAX, especially for a longer stay, can be a challenge. You want to be prepared for different weather conditions and activities, but you also don't want to be lugging around a massive, unwieldy suitcase.

- **Check Luggage Restrictions:** Every airline has different rules regarding checked and carry-on baggage size and weight limits. Be sure to check your airline's policy *before* you start packing to avoid expensive fees at the airport.
- **Layers are Key:** European weather can be unpredictable, even in the warmer months. Packing layers allows you to adjust to changing temperatures throughout the day.
- **Comfortable Footwear is Non-Negotiable:** You'll likely be doing a lot of walking in Europe. Invest in a good pair of comfortable walking shoes. Your feet will thank you.
- **Travel Adapters:** European electrical outlets are different from those in the US. You’ll need a travel adapter to charge your electronics.
- **Consider a Capsule Wardrobe:** Pack versatile items that can be mixed and matched to create different outfits. This helps you pack lighter while still having options.
- **Don't Forget Medications and Essential Documents:** Keep any necessary medications in your carry-on luggage, along with copies of important documents like your passport, flight confirmations, and accommodation details.

Packing effectively isn't just about fitting everything in; it's about packing smartly so you have what you need without being overburdened. Think of it like assembling a tactical travel kit – everything has a purpose.

### Travel Insurance: An Essential Safety Net

Traveling from LAX to Europe is a significant undertaking, and while you hope for the best, unforeseen events can happen. Travel insurance is arguably one of the most important things to purchase before your trip.

Travel insurance can cover a range of situations, including:

- **Trip Cancellation or Interruption:** If you have to cancel your trip due to illness, injury, or other covered reasons, travel insurance can reimburse you for non-refundable expenses.
- **Medical Expenses:** Healthcare costs in Europe can be expensive for foreigners. Travel insurance can cover emergency medical treatment.
- **Lost or Delayed Luggage:** If your luggage is lost, stolen, or delayed, travel insurance can help cover the cost of essential items and replacement of lost belongings.
- **Travel Delays:** Some policies offer compensation for significant travel delays.

Don't skip on travel insurance. It's a small investment that can save you a lot of money and stress if something goes wrong. Think of it as your personal safety net in case of unexpected bumps in the road.

At the Airport: Navigating LAX and Your European Gateway
--------------------------------------------------------

LAX is a beast of an airport, and even experienced travelers can feel a little flustered navigating its terminals. Knowing a few tips and tricks can make your departure from LAX a smoother experience and arriving at a European airport a little less daunting.

### Conquering LAX: Getting There and Checked In

Getting to LAX can be an adventure in itself depending on traffic. Factor in plenty of extra time, especially during peak hours. Consider using ride-sharing services, taxis, or airport shuttles. Parking at LAX can be expensive, so research your options beforehand.

Once you're at the airport, have your e-ticket confirmation or mobile boarding pass ready. Many airlines offer online check-in 24 hours before your flight, which can save you time at the airport. If you have checked baggage, head to the baggage drop counter. Give yourself ample time – at least 3 hours for international flights from LAX is a good rule of thumb.

Navigating security at LAX can also take time. Have your ID and boarding pass ready, and be prepared to remove electronics and liquids (following theTSA 3-1-1 rule for carry-on liquids).

### Arriving in Europe: Immigration and Beyond

The feeling of landing in Europe after a long flight from LAX is pretty great! The process upon arrival typically involves immigration, baggage claim, and customs.

- **Immigration:** Upon arrival, you'll go through immigration control. Have your passport ready. Be prepared to answer basic questions about the purpose of your visit and how long you plan to stay.
- **Baggage Claim:** After immigration, head to the baggage claim area. Find the carousel number for your flight and wait for your luggage. If your bags don't appear, report it to the airline's baggage desk *before* leaving the baggage claim area.
- **Customs:** In most cases, you'll just walk through the ""Nothing to Declare"" channel at customs unless you have items that need to be declared (like large amounts of cash or restricted goods).

Remember, airport staff in Europe might have different procedures and customs than at LAX. Be patient and polite, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you're unsure about something.

Making the Most of Your European Adventure (After the LAX to Europe flight!)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You've successfully made the journey from LAX to Europe – congratulations! Now it's time to truly embrace your adventure. Getting around Europe is a whole different ballgame than navigating Southern California, and understanding the transportation options is key to maximizing your time and experience.

### Getting Around Within Europe: Trains, Planes, and Automobiles

Europe has a fantastic and extensive public transportation system, making it relatively easy to get between cities and countries.

- **Trains:** Rail travel is a popular and often scenic way to traverse Europe. High-speed trains connect major cities quickly and comfortably. For shorter distances, regional trains are a great option. Consider purchasing a rail pass if you plan on doing a lot of train travel.
- **Budget Airlines:** For longer distances or if you're short on time, budget airlines within Europe offer cheap flights between many cities. However, remember to factor in extra costs for baggage and potential airport transfers.
- **Buses:** Intercity buses are often the most budget-friendly option for getting around Europe. They can take longer than trains or planes, but they are a great way to see the countryside and save money.
- **Car Rental:** Renting a car can be a good option if you plan to explore rural areas or have a specific itinerary that isn’t well-served by public transport. Just remember that driving styles and road rules can differ significantly from the US, and parking in European cities can be challenging and expensive.

Think about your itinerary and budget when deciding on how to get around. A combination of these options is often the most effective way to see Europe.

### Money Matters: Euros, Pounds, and Planning Your Budget

The currency used in Europe varies. The Euro (€) is the common currency in many European Union countries (the Eurozone), while others have their own currencies (like the British Pound in the UK, the Swiss Franc in Switzerland, etc.).

- **Inform Your Bank:** Let your bank know you'll be traveling abroad to avoid having your cards blocked due to suspicious activity.
- **ATMs are Your Friends:** ATMs (cash machines) are widely available throughout Europe and are often the best way to get local currency at a good exchange rate. Avoid using currency exchange booths at airports or tourist areas as they often have unfavorable rates.
- **Credit Cards Widely Accepted:** Credit cards are widely accepted in most establishments, especially in cities. Just make sure your card has a chip (EMV) and ideally doesn't charge foreign transaction fees.
- **Carry Some Cash:** It's always a good idea to have a small amount of the local currency on hand for small purchases or places that don't accept cards.

Plan your budget before you go, considering accommodation, food, transportation, activities, and souvenirs. Research average costs in the cities you’ll be visiting to get a realistic picture. Europe can be done on a shoestring budget or as a luxurious splurge – it all depends on your choices. Budgeting effectively is key to a stress-free trip.

### Communication and Connectivity: Staying in Touch

Staying connected while traveling from LAX to Europe is important for safety, convenience, and sharing your awesome photos with friends and family back home.

- **Unlock Your Phone:** If your phone is locked to your current carrier, you might consider getting it unlocked so you can use a local SIM card in Europe.
- **International Roaming:** Your US phone carrier likely offers international roaming plans. These can be convenient but can also be quite expensive.
- **Local SIM Card:** Purchasing a local SIM card upon arrival in Europe is often the cheapest option for data and local calls. You'll get a European phone number.
- **eSIM:** Many newer phones support eSIMs, which are digital SIM cards. This allows you to purchase a data plan for Europe online before you even leave LAX.
- **Wi-Fi Hotspots:** Wi-Fi is widely available in hotels, cafes, and public areas throughout Europe.

Having reliable connectivity makes navigating, using translation apps, and staying in touch so much easier. Don't leave this to chance!

Beyond the Tourist Trail: Embracing the European Experience
-----------------------------------------------------------

You've made the long journey from LAX to Europe. Now it's time to go beyond just seeing the major landmarks and truly immerse yourself in the local culture. This is where the real magic happens!

### Food and Drink: A Culinary Adventure

One of the absolute highlights of traveling to Europe is the food! Forget everything you think you know; the flavors, ingredients, and dining customs are incredible and diverse.

- **Embrace Local Cuisine:** Don't just stick to familiar dishes. Try the local specialties! Order that strange-sounding dish on the menu, seek out local markets, and ask for recommendations from locals.
- **Cafes and Pastries:** European cafes are a way of life. Spend time people-watching with a coffee and a delicious pastry.
- **Wine and Beer:** Sample the local wines and beers. Europe has a rich tradition of brewing and winemaking, and trying the regional varieties is a must.
- **Dining Etiquette:** Familiarize yourself with basic dining etiquette in the countries you visit. For example, tipping customs can vary greatly.

Eating and drinking in Europe is more than just sustenance; it's a cultural experience. Be adventurous with your taste buds!

### Culture and Customs: Avoiding Awkward Blunders

While many European cultures share some similarities with the US, there are also important differences in customs and etiquette to be aware of.

- **Basic Greetings:** Learning a few basic phrases in the local language (hello, please, thank you, excuse me) goes a long way and will be appreciated by locals.
- **Meeting and Greeting:** Handshakes are common. In some countries, a kiss on each cheek (the number varies) is customary among friends and family.
- **Punctuality:** Punctuality is generally valued, especially for appointments.
- **Noise Levels:** Europeans tend to be more reserved in public spaces compared to Americans. Be mindful of your noise level in restaurants and on public transport.
- **Shopping:** In many European countries, bagging your own groceries is common. Also, be prepared to pay a small fee for plastic bags.

Being aware of and respecting local customs shows cultural sensitivity and can make your interactions much smoother and more enjoyable. It's like stepping into someone else's home – you want to be a good guest, right?

### Safety and Security: Staying Savvy on the Streets

While Europe is generally safe for tourists, like any major tourist destination, petty crime can occur. Being aware of your surroundings and taking some basic precautions can help keep you and your belongings safe.

- **Be Aware of Pickpockets:** Pickpocketing is a common issue in crowded tourist areas. Keep your valuables secure and out of sight. Consider using a money belt or a bag with secure closures.
- **Be Wary of Scams:** Be aware of common tourist scams, such as people asking for signatures on petitions or street performers demanding excessive payment.
- **Use Reputable Public Transport:** Stick to official taxis or ride-sharing services, and be aware of your belongings on crowded public transport.
- **Keep Valuables Secure:** Don't leave valuables unattended in your car or hotel room.
- **Know Emergency Numbers:** Familiarize yourself with the emergency number in the countries you are visiting (112 is the common emergency number in EU countries).

Traveling smart and staying aware of your surroundings is key to a safe and enjoyable trip. Don't let fear overshadow your adventure, but a healthy dose of caution is always wise.

We have our first child now 19 months old. We’ve both worked full time since we were 13-15 years old. 

We own our own home and property outright and are working to pay off our remaining debts (two vehicles) ASAP. 

My question is how do women make the leap or gradual shift to being a sahw or sahm to more easily take on the duties of a tradwife? I was raised Christian and find leggings to be too revealing. I’ve found dressing modestly to be more comfortable for most of my life. I do enjoy being polite, demure and courteous when out and about but we also enjoy that behind closed doors a certain level of propriety is forgotten. My husband has the arduous task of getting the attitude right outta me. Once that’s done, we’re both very much happier and at peace.

Cook a hearty breakfast, care for chickens and use their eggs for meals, make pies, cobblers, trifles, and use a slow cooker for an amazing roast. 

Do I work full time until the vehicles are paid off completely, then quit the corporate workforce to be more present in the home for my family?

If you were to stop by and pop in, you’d probably get just about what you’d expect from any old country diner. It’s about the size of a short, double wide trailer. So, the interior is a bit claustrophobic, but just spacious enough that you won’t feel trapped. It has a unique…smell— like cigarette smoke and floral perfume had some fucked-up love child and decided it needed to die there. 
Pictures of unidentifiable people eating are randomly taped to the wood-paneled walls (partially for advertising but mostly to cover some holes). A flickering neon “open” sign sits in one of the large windows. They’re framed with old Christmas lights and let in a natural light when the sun’s up, but also allow you get a full view of the road, surrounding woods, or Lucky, the veteran coyote, as you eat.
 

He’s not exactly a vet, as he’s never really been in any war— not any major ones, at least. Just the on-going one that he has against the local farmers and their chickens, but it’s left the poor bastard looking like he just came out of Nam. He’s only got one eye, three feet, half an ear, and the fur on his tail seemingly refuses to grow normally. We (and by we, I mean *I*) felt bad and gave him a piece of some expired food, one time. And now, he refuses to leave. He’s been hit by at least three cars and two trucks (that we know of) and still insists on staring at people as they eat.
 

Another sight you may have the misfortune, (or blessing depending on who you ask) of seeing out those windows, would be what we have dubbed as “the sign dancer.” A hairy and rather…voluptuous man who will occasionally appear and pole dance on the sign out front. We’re not sure if he’s a ghost or just some dude with too much time on his hands, but we do know that his dances can make people feel things. It’s different for everyone, Mrs. Kelvins said she felt peace for the first time in years, while Mr. Branson said he felt “true” horror. However, after having watched the man dance myself, I’d say it was interesting, but mostly kinda disturbing. (Like watching someone chug expired milk.)
 

As for upkeep, I’m pretty sure it’s just seen as an aesthetic choice.
 

An old, eyeless mannequin with a purple Mardi Gras necklace and a name tag sticker on its chest that reads “Hello! My name is: Tomila” sits next to the entrance as a makeshift coatrack. If you get close enough to it, you’ll notice it has that sickly sweet aroma of rot clinging to it. (No matter how much it’s cleaned or sprayed with Febreze, it will not go away.) A cork board covered in papers, ranging from missing pet posters to advertisements and a few newspaper clippings, sits on the other side. 
Booths are lined up against smudged windows and advertisements for local businesses are trapped under the clear, yet sticky, plastic coverings on the tables.

There’s an open kitchen, with grease-stained utilities that haven’t been updated since poodle skirts were a thing, and coffee pots that look like they survived Chernobyl. A dented mini fridge softly hums at the back wall, next to the batter covered waffle irons that strangely smell like burnt hair every time they’re used. There’s a milkshake station (It’s continued functionality is proof that miracles really do exist, and honestly, it’s what gets me through the day sometimes.) that sits next to the drink machine, where the stubborn, red sticky mess beneath it all has been fighting with the grease to become a permanent fixture. The checkered linoleum floors are cracked and stained in some places. Sometimes when it rains, a mysterious brownish liquid— that smells oddly like pennies —oozes from them and forms shapes similar to human footprints. A jukebox, riddled with bullet holes, sits next to the bathroom hallway (Sometimes it “glitches” and the screams of children come from it. Usually, it has to be unplugged for a few minutes whenever that happens.) and plays country music and the occasional pop or rock song.
 

I’m not one hundred percent sure, but I think the health inspector is either sleeping with the owners’ daughter or has brain damage or (who knows) maybe it’s both. Like, this guy will straight up look at the weird black goop stuff in the mop station and be like, “Yeah, this is okay.” It’s shady as fuck, but if there’s one thing we can count on, it’s that he’ll sign off on this shit hole as being “safe,” like, pretty much no matter what.
 

If you find yourself needing to go number one or two (or three) after a meal or just in general, then you may find a hot dog on the floor next to the toilet paper rack. Its appearance in one of the two bathrooms depends entirely on what day of the week it is, though. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, it will be in the men’s room. But on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, it will be in the women’s room. It’s absent on Saturdays. And while we highly suggest against its consumption, we cannot control what you do. 

Having said that, the people who have eaten it claim it allowed them to have seen into the future for a few hours. Others became violently ill (just as we predicted they would), and were doomed to spend their evening in the very room they consumed the forsaken cylinder of meat in.
 

If you do stop by, don’t be a stranger! I’m pretty much always on the clock and I’m more than happy to take your order or sit and chat or both! I’m bored as fuck and my coworker, Kurt, isn’t a very good conversationalist. And there isn’t any phone service or internet at diner. So, if you have any important calls to make, you’ll have to go out to the edge of the road. Or you can use the old phone booth! It’s pretty much in the same place. It’s next to the only streetlight we have out here, so it’s pretty hard to miss. Do be careful if you ever have to use it, though. We have the occasional hobo or crazy person come out of the woods to try and “phone home.” They can get pretty violent, and as much as I’d like the show, I’m supposed to treat the parking lot fights as though they were happening in-store. The owners put that rule in place, and they review the cameras to make sure we break them up. And I really don’t want to deal with anymore violence than I already have to. (I am very tired, and I am not a very large or strong lady. So, breaking up fights is very hard for me. Please think of me and the consequences of your own actions.)


On the odd occasion that I’m not working, but you still want to chat with someone. Then I highly suggest that you be cautious with the locals. Some of them are lovely people, don’t get me wrong. I’d just rather not leave Kurt to deal with a fight, should one break out, while I’m not there. Because, while Southern hospitality is a given with most of our regulars, it can still…run a bit short, if you know what I mean.


If you go in the mornings you may meet a fair bit of them, like Mr. Stimson, an older man who usually comes between the hours of seven andnine AM to order a few cups of coffee and a gravy biscuit. He used to own the old scrap yard. And despite there not being any big wild cats native to this area and the nearest zoo not housing any, he will tell you all about how his dogs were snatched, one at a time, by a black panther. Never mind the fact that he has only ever had but one dog. (It’s very sweet and follows him like a little shadow. Sometimes he brings it to the diner.)


Mr. Canterbury, he always gets the morning special that comes with one waffle, two eggs, and a side of bacon or sausage. But he gets the bacon instead of the sausage, because he claims that it “*taste too much like human flesh*.” (I can assure you now, that the sausage is not made of flesh. We’re not sure where it comes from, but the owners assured us that we weren’t eating living people.)


Ms. Cleo Janice comes in late in the afternoon and orders exactly one egg, a thing of cheesy hash browns, and a strawberry milkshake. She always says that Tomila is “crying” and that the mannequin is “sick.” Me and Kurt think she may be projecting her feelings and trying to ask for some form of help. But the last time we just up and asked if she needed any, she wound up getting a bit…violent, insisting that it was Tomila that was needing help. We’ve considered banning her from the diner, but she tips, like, *really* good. So, we just keep our mouths shut and give her what she orders.


Then there’s Mr. Johnson. He doesn’t really have a usual meal, insisting that we should “surprise” him and give him whatever. However, he always refuses to drink water. He claimed our water had made him unable to eat fish. As every time he saw one, it apparently had his late wife’s face and would “*beg him to stop*” or “*let go*” with her voice.


If you have questions, then so do it. But unfortunately for the both of us, they will forever go unanswered. Because Mr. Johnson, the slippery bastard that he was, died. They found him in his kitchen a few months ago, soaking wet. Apparently, he somehow managed to drown himself while eating fish tacos.


So, to sum it all up, the diner is weird as fuck, but it’s become a major part of my life. So, I figured I’d start sharing a few of my experiences with y’all.",2,1749365064.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

**Can I use a standard dining table as a board game coffee table?**
while you can technically use a standard dining table, it's not ideal. Standard dining tables lack the recessed playing surface and integrated storage of dedicated board game coffee tables.

Board game coffee tables are also designed for comfortable play at coffee table height, improving ergonomics during extended game sessions.

**How do I choose the right size board game coffee table for my space?**
Consider the size of your living room or game room, as well as the number of players you typically accommodate. A larger table provides ample space for larger games and more players but may overwhelm a smaller room. Measure your available space and choose a table that fits comfortably without obstructing traffic flow. Also, consider the dimensions of your favourite board games to ensure they fit comfortably on the playing surface.

**What is the typical price range for a quality board game coffee table?**
The price of a board game coffee table can vary widely, depending on the quality of materials, size, and features. Basic models may start around $500, while high-end tables made from solid hardwood with extensive storage and customization options can cost several thousand dollars. Expect to invest at least $800-$1,500 for a mid-range table with decent storage and durable construction.

1l65pn9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l65pn9,Share The Meal,"Not sure how many of you have heard of an app called ""ShareTheMeal"" it’s a project by the UN, under their World Food Programme.

The idea is simple, you can donate to different causes or goals, and every donation helps provide meals to those in need.

It starts from just USD $0.80 per meal (less than a cup of coffee), so for around USD$4.80, you can provide six meals for a family or people in need.

I used to donate to various programs, but I’ve focused more on Lebanon ever since it was added after the last war.

Also, when you create an account, the app shows your personal impact (shown in the first photo) how many meals you’ve donated, how many goals you’ve supported, and the countries you’ve helped.

Therefore, if you could afford to spend USD$0.80 for at least one meal, know that you've helped someone in need.",2,1749364878.0,lebanon,2,0.63,False

At dances, coffee shops, through friends. Now everyone's glued to their phones. But that's just the beginning. What's coming next is gonna blow your mind.

Just finished a long haul, and my co-driver tells me about his son who fell in love. With a girl from a video game. I'm not kidding! Spends all day chatting with her, buying virtual gifts, even going on dates in there. Here's the kicker - she's not even real, just computer code. But the kid's happy as a clam, says she understands him better than any real person.

You know what? There's more and more folks like this. People finding love in virtual worlds, falling for characters created by computers. Why? Because dealing with AI is easier - no yelling, no nagging about money for makeup, always looks perfect. And most importantly - always listens and supports you.

But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Picture this - soon people will be getting married in virtual worlds to folks they've never actually met! They meet in some game, chat for six months, and boom - wedding in a digital castle. Virtual cake, guests as avatars, and they buy rings with cryptocurrency.

You're probably thinking - what about kids? Well, here's where it gets really wild. Future parents will be able to pick genes for their baby right in the virtual world. Like creating a character in a game - choose eye color, height, abilities. Except this will be a real kid. Scary to even think about, right?

Now here's the really interesting part - cheating. What do you think, is it cheating if your wife flirts with a virtual character? What if she's seeing a real person, but only in the digital world? New kinds of jealousy are popping up. Guys will be jealous of computer characters, and women will be jealous of virtual girlfriends.

And imagine getting divorced in this world. Splitting up the house is one thing, but how do you split a virtual castle you built together for five years? Or a game character you both leveled up? Lawyers are gonna need new courses - ""How to Split Digital Assets in Divorce.""

I sometimes think about this stuff while driving - where are we heading? On one hand, technology gives new opportunities for love. You can find the perfect partner, create perfect relationships. On the other hand - where are the real emotions, actual hugs, the smell of someone you love?

Maybe in ten years I'll meet a trucker on the road who's hauling freight while being married to artificial intelligence and raising a kid custom-made in a virtual lab. Sounds like science fiction, but hey, the internet used to seem like magic too.

You know what worries me most? What if people forget how to love for real? Get used to perfect relationships with computers and stop putting up with real people's flaws. Why deal with your wife's bad moods when your virtual girlfriend always smiles?

Then again, maybe it's not all bad. So many lonely people out there who can't find anyone. Now everyone could meet their love, even if it's digital. Main thing is to be happy, right?

I just wonder - how will kids from these marriages grow up? What will they think love is if their parents met in a virtual world and live half their lives in digital reality?

And think about this - if people can create perfect partners, what happens to real feelings? Love isn't just pleasure, it's also pain, jealousy, fights, and making up. If you take away all the bad stuff, is it still love?

Honestly, my head's spinning from all this. The world's changing so fast you can't keep up. Yesterday it seemed normal to meet people online, tomorrow it'll be normal to marry a robot.

But here's the weirdest part - maybe we're already living at the start of this era. How many people spend more time on social media than with real friends? How many fall in love with Instagram photos without even knowing the person? Maybe virtual love is already among us, we just don't notice it yet.

The future's knocking whether we like it or not. And what it looks like depends on us. Will we learn to combine technology with real feelings, or turn into people who only love screens?

What do you think? Are you ready for this kind of future? Could you fall in love with a virtual character or is that complete nonsense to you? Drop a comment, I'm curious to hear what regular folks think. After all, we're the ones who'll be living in this new world of love and relationships.",2,1749364666.0,matrix4hire,1,0.76,False

as it was filled with this strange connect I have with the universe. It had my mind including you wherever I could see it- Mojo magic, the beautiful Chinese elm, Daisy, Masie, Masie and then the Korean customer who knew my story because hers is very similar. 1974 was when hers began and in so many ways mine did too.

I recall a couple of months prior to 11/2 I was sharing a little bit of my book with the group and I got to the part where the 3 angels morphed into a 3 headed dragon and began destroying underworld drug manufacturing operations in China and you were a little put off, like I had something against China or Chinese in general. I don't and never have.

Then came the Golden Gate Bridge Instagram /and your shared pic a few hours later
then the frogs and 
before that was the 2005 coincidental incidental incidents that never came to be due to changing from plan a to plan b. I wonder if....had I spent a day or two in your town, if we'd have crossed paths at a coffee shop or maybe at an intersection as I was making my way  out of town.  Hmm, we will never know, but what if.....


Tonight as I hand wrestled my mojo 
I thought about you and your Maisie.
I wondered how you're doing, if you're happy, and if you think of me.
ive wondered if ever you did see the various poems that I've written here.
It shows I have 4 followers but it gives no other info.
I could tell from the chatter in the room that at least one of y'all was seeing it and as I shared one night in notes that I wrote, that I wasn't aware of how Reddit worked when all of this began but caught onto a following shortly after thanks to the chatter and then reading up on how Reddit works.

Yes I had a crush on M., that was obvious but I had one on you too but you had a boyfriend.

I began to feel uncomfortable about writing vaguely so I came clean. It upset the apple cart I knew as some words flew. I'll change your name you said with some disdain is all I recall. L referred to me as a fool too. I had no option but to shrug it off. I was not and am not trying to play games with anybody's hearts or minds.

My chair that I sit in and have sat in for years happens to point right at the eastern edge of Washington (I've used a compass to know this but cannot say exactly where it's centered because I'm not that precise with one).

i’ll start with some context

I (25m) have worked with this company out on the river for 3.5 years now after i got out of the military. As soon as i started I started having a problem with a Pilot wanting to get me fired for reason i have no clue to. ( all i’ve heard about that is he doesn’t like how small i was and he didn’t like they way i look bc of my long hair )

things were fine for awhile he would cause issues here and there and then nothing serious,

Just here recently I got out of his Harbor and now only come to fill in if someone calls off and that leads to this issue, i came in on my time off to work on this persons boat the pilot lets call him john. he was on the opposite shift and my supervisor has told me to just avoid him. i walk onto the boat and the first thing he starts to say to me is “ I know you called the hotline on me “ this happens two years ago he was calling me a homophobic slur and i asked him to stop and he kept going so i called a hotline the company has set up for that. as far as i know he revived no repercussions. That’s what he was mention and started to put the blame on let’s say “Blake” and i have no idea why john brought it up. Anyways after the incident i did what my supervisor told me to do, i called him and explained what happened and he asked me if i wanted him 
to say something to him and i said no because it wasn’t that big of a deal and didn’t want to create problems. well 12 hours later as i was getting on my shift Another pilot that was filling in lets say “Rick” asked me to make “John” coffe for when he comes in, and I told him that I wasn’t going to because it wasn’t my job, also i didn’t feel comfortable anyways, and he told me to tie off the boat and he would, “John” comes onto watch up the steps screaming at me how it’s my job to make him coffe and this and that so on. So i told him i’m going to call my supervisor because that’s what he told me to do. So i called him and he answers why “john” is still yelling at me then i step out and explain what’s going on. He tells me it’s not my job to make him coffee and that we aren’t supposed to be making pilots coffee anyways because we could spike it and they can’t prove it. Anyways i leave work and i hear that “john” told his boss i freaked out and wouldn’t do my job and was screaming and then my boss told his boss he heard “john” screaming at me when i called. 

That brings me to the advice i need.
Tonight I was out at the bar with my friends, then i have someone who i previously worked with approach me well call him “Eric” he approaches me and starts explain how the bar owner told “john” i was here and “john” sent him to “take care of me” and he told me he would t because he knew me but started telling me he and “john” know everyone in town the police and people we work with and that i need to stop causing problems at work. I’m not sure how to handle this or what to do i can’t afford to lose my job. The bar that this happens to was about 40 mins from my house.

Edit* I’ve already texted my Supervisor that i needed to talk to him because something serious happened but it was about 11pm and he’s off on the weekends.",1,1749364310.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1l65kc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1l65kc1/advice_on_losing_weight/,Advice on losing weight,"Hi guys 

I just wanted some advice on losing weight as I fall into the overweight category in regards to my height and age.

Age: 27

Male

Weight: 96kgs/ 211Lbs

Height: 165cm/5.5ft

My ideal weight would be between 75kg/165Lbs

What is the best way to achieve my goal and what sort of time frame am I looking at?

My usual routine for the week

I work from Monday to Saturday 6am to 6pm, I do not have a lot of time on my hands to go to the gym.

I do have some home weights but I do not usually work out.

I play football/soccer once a week for 60 mins
 
I jog twice a week for about 30 mins to an hour 

I do approximately 10k-15k steps a day at work (if this matters)

I have a cup of coffee in the morning and do not eat for most of the day, my only meal is usually around 7pm.

I don't exactly know my calorie intake, I don't eat very unhealthy (as of the last month). Usually, on a weekly basis I would say I eat the following 

Pasta/chicken and salad/tuna sandwich/steak and chips (fries) mainly and once a week we buy takeout. 

I've recently stopped drinking fizzy drinks and lowered my sugar intake which has helped but it is like I have hit a brick wall with weightloss. 

At my highest weight (about 2 months ago) I was at 102kgs but I have found it difficult to lose further weight. My weight fluctuates between 94kgs and 96kgs.

Is there anything I can do better or do more of that would help me achieve my goal?

Thank you!",1,1749364276.0,loseit,9,1.0,False

However when I spoke to the city to apply for str license she gave me the runaround that this is a secondary dwelling and that even a microwave is a cooking “facility” and that it needs zoning etc to be a proper sdu.

The average person is uncomfortable with death, but not me. I can talk about it all day, keeping my head at the right tilt, the proper amount of frown on my face. There’s an art to finding the right amount of nodding to signal that you understand, but not so much so that you appear to agree with their grief laden thoughts. I hit up support groups, hospitals, hell, I’d go to the morgue if they let me. It’s a grim business, but they’re just my kind of clientele. 

Tom was like any other parent experiencing their worst nightmare; outliving his children after a terrible accident. He was referred by a friend of a friend who thought he might need a safe space to land, aka my cheap ass sofa and box of bargain tissues. I listened to him drone on about the usual surface level shit for a few sessions - his heart hurts, he’s so sad - before I finally got him to get to the good stuff. 

“I know this is hard, but hard is the way through.” - I said, dutifully reciting therapist babble. 

“If you’re sure… I trust you.” - Tom sniffled. 

*Jackpot.*

I smiled empathetically, keeping the glimmer out of my eye, and slid the tissues and bottled water closer to him. 

“I’m sure. Sharing your pain makes it easier to carry. Let me hold some of these feelings with you.” I said, another cliche I’ve said countless times. 

Tom takes a swig of water before he describes the accident; a horrible, unexpected fire that took away everything - his wife, kids, house, his whole life. How he almost didn’t make it out when the roof collapsed. 

“…and I just lay there, thinking ‘I could let go and be with them. I don’t have to crawl out of here.’” Tom says, tears brimming his eye lashes, gulping water after talking for 10 minutes straight. 

I resist the urge to roll my eyes. 

“That is heavy… let me ask you, why?” 

“Why what?” He grabs a tissue and dutifully dots at his eyes. 

“Why did you get up?” I ask, putting on my trademark frown. 

“I don’t… what?” He falters.

I stifle a sigh.

“Why get up? Why not just lay there and die like you should have?” I ask, more poignantly. 

“Oh… I don’t know… I guess it was just survival kicking in maybe…” The words come out but he’s not convinced, eyes half glazed.

“Do you think it was a mistake?”

“What was a mistake?” 

“You surviving.” I say, my eyes staring into his big brown ones, so wide and confused. 

“I - why?” He asks, glancing around the room as if he can’t decide if this is real.

“I mean… it’s not like you got a lot going for you Tim.” 

“I - it’s Tom.” He corrects me.

“Sure. Look, you don’t have your house. You’ve already blown through your life insurance. Genies cheating on you, what’s the point?” 

“Genies what?! Ho-ow doo” he slurs

“Ladies talk at book club. Listen, your life is meaningless. You know it, I know it, your girlfriend out there banging other dudes knows it.” I lean forward, ready to cut the shit. The hour is almost up, after all. 

Tom’s eyes fill with tears, his lip trembles.

“You’re right.” 

I smile, carefully laying the gun on the chipping coffee table. “You know what to do. You always have.” 

Thank god this office is in a bad part of town, or that gunshot may have interested the neighbors. 

It’s not honest work, but it’s mine, I sigh, looking at Tom’s sad body on the carpet. I grab the phony diplomas from the wall along with the drugged up water bottle and shove them in my bag, throwing the suicide note on the table and making my way out. 

It took longer than normal to find one this time and I am ready for a new place to sink my teeth into. I never worry about someone coming after me, after all, Tom doesn’t have anyone but his mistress left, and she’ll be too happy about the surprise large life insurance payout to worry about it too much. By the time they figure out she had nothing to do with it, I’ll be a few names away. 

Don’t feel too bad for Tom. He knew the risk when he lit that fire that night. Sure, he just wanted to be rids of his kids and wife, the idiot just happened to miscalculate the amount of gas and barely got out in time. His mistress Genie told me everything in that stupid excuse-to-get-wine-wasted-book-club, bragging about finally having him all to herself. Barf. She wasn’t cheating though, and I do feel a bit bad about that lie. I’ll make sure to anonymously send her a few bottles of wine as condolences, a secret apology.

It feels good to finally tell the truth, in this business of lies, even if it is just into the internet void. It can take me weeks to get to these shit heaps, and months before I can get them in the right headspace to pull the trigger, or take the pills, or yada yada. It feels good to share my accomplishment, even if no one ever reads this. 

But if you do happen upon it, don’t forget about people like me. Those who are watching, waiting for you to think you’ve gotten away with it. ",2,1749364173.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1l65ho9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Viidith22/comments/1l65ho9/the_wolf_of_koreth_part_1/,The Wolf of Koreth (Part 1),"Griger Kel-Am watched from his cell in the old town jailhouse as workers busily erected a scaffolding in the courtyard below. It was shaping up nicely, he thought with an appreciative nod; the skeletal beams reminded him of the bones of dead animals in the Karel Desert and that comparison almost disturbed him. 

Which was no easy feat. Griger had seen the worst the world had to offer. He fought beasts in the Staygin Mountains, fended off feral bandits in the Jarel Plains, and weathered more attacks, fights, battles, and death than most people even knew existed. Nothing on earth could rattle him. He couldn’t afford to let himself be shaken. Life, he had learned, was like a surging storm tide. You either stand strong against it, or you get knocked down and swept away. Griger refused to be swept away. He refused to wind up like the old bones he stumbled across on the North Road and in the snowy stepps at the top of the world. A man must be hard and stoic to survive, and he must be harder and colder to thrive. 

Despite his grizzled face, many scars, dead eyes, and unseemly facial hair, Griger, a sword for hire since before the Great Plague, had always thrived. 

Sighing, Griger left the window and walked over to the door; three brisk paces. He threaded his arms through the bars and tried his best to look up the corridor. In the cells across from him, other men, their faces dirty and white, cowered, waiting for their judgement.

Their open fear disgusted Griger.

Cowards.

Griger wasn’t afraid to die. Dying was easy; you closed your eyes and went to sleep. Living...living was hard, every day a knock down, drag out fight for dominance against something. Outlaws, nature, your own inner darkness. He did not seek death, but he welcomed it. The prospect of a noose tightening around his neck, of his body jerking and dancing before many jeering eyes and spitting mouths, however, almost bothered him.

But as a wise old man he once knew had said, This too shall pass. 

A sardonic smile touched Griger’s chapped lips and he shook his head like a man who couldn’t believe what he was seeing. Of all the things he’d done in his life to deserve a hanging, self-defense is what did him in. Ha. 

Two weeks ago, he was following the river from the North, on foot and alone save for his sword and his rucksack. He stopped at a tide pool to drink, and was beset by a man with a knife. In his frock coat and rubberized boots, he was too well dressed to be a highwayman; he never spoke a word until he lay in the grass, his throat laid open and gushing rich red blood. “Scoundrel,” he gurgled.

Griger relieved him of his boots and pocketbook and carried on. Before dusk, he came across the village and rented a room at the inn. Women in cheap, homespun dresses haunted the halls, knocking at doors to sell their company, and Griger, lying in bed by the flickering light of a lamp, was considering spending the rest of the money on one when three constables broke down the door. 

The man he killed, they told him later, was the son of the mayor. At that moment, Griger knew he was in trouble. 

They refused to believe that the son attacked first and pointed to the things Griger had taken from his as proof of overland piracy, theft, and murder. He was tried in a packed courtroom and found guilty, standing tall and proud but alone as no lawyer in the land would take his case. 

Out in the courtyard, someone shouted, and a team of horses neighed, Griger, sitting on the edge of his cot, looked up at the window. The light was getting weaker as night approached. Shadows, long and black, fell through the slats and made unwholesome shapes across the earthen floor. Down the hall, a man cried out for water, and elsewhere, someone raked a metal cup back and forth across the bars. Would they hang him tonight, Griger wondered, or would they wait for dawn?

“You,” someone spat.

 Griger looked up to find the mayor standing at the bars, his bloated face filled with hatred. Another man was with him, this one taller and thinner. They were both clad in the finest garments, but the stranger was undoubtedly better suited. Griger took him for a government official.

 “What do you want?” Griger asked, an edge in his voice.

 The mayor opened his mouth to speak, but the stranger silenced him. “My name is Urick Farbin. I’m the governor of Ezk Province and I have a proposition for you.”

 “What’s that?”

 Farbin flashed a tight smile.

 It looked to Griger like he wouldn’t be hanged at all.

 And that made him smile.







\*\*\*



 Griger watched the countryside pass slowly by, all green hills, trickling brooks, and dense thickets. The occasional straw hut loomed out of the wilderness like an antsy thief, and six miles out of the village, they passed a stately manor house that could only have belonged to the mayor.

 It was mid-afternoon and the overcast day wrapped itself around Griger like a wet blanket. The previous night, Governor Farbin sprang Griger from his cell and brought him to the inn, where he was kept under armed guard. Griger spent most of the evening in a straight back chair and whittling. You don’t have to worry, he said to the sentry standing at the door, I’m not going anywhere. 

And he wasn’t. He was not an honor bound man by any stretch, but Farbin saved his life, and Griger reckoned that earned him a little loyalty.

The guards didn’t stand down, but Griger didn’t blame them. He wouldn’t have either.

In the morning, they set off in a horse drawn carriage, heading northwest along the Western Road. Now, hours later, Griger sat next to the Governor, who wore a dark cloak and wide-brimmed hat befitting his office. Beside him, the driver held the reins and stared ahead with the practiced indifference of a man used to tuning out things he wasn’t supposed to hear.

 “Will you explain to me what I’m doing?” Griger asked.

 Farbin was quiet for a moment, then he looked up at the sky, the muted light bathing his craggy features. “Your file says that you’ve done work for the Government.”

 “Some,” Griger replied. 

 “You’ve handled things of a singular nature,” the old man continued. “Things that most other men have never dreamed possible.”

 Gringer nodded. He had. His only oath was to himself, and he worked for whoever paid him the highest sum. Men like him were called mercenaries but he preferred to think of himself as a businessman. 

 “There’s a matter in a nearby village that has been ongoing for quite some time,” Farbin said, picking his words carefully. “I have sent my best agents and they’ve done nothing for it. When the paperwork on you came to my office, I checked your name, as I do all condemned men, and knew at once that you were the man for this job.”

 Griger was almost touched. “What’s the job?”

 The Governor turned to face Griger, his expression bloodless and sober, as though he had something great yet terrible to impart upon him. “Do you believe in werewolves?”

 “Yes,” he said, “I do.”

 “Have you ever killed one?”

 Griger hesitated. “No,” he said, “not personally, but I was with a party that did.”

 Five years before, Griger wintered in a village among the steep foothills guarding the forbidding expanse of Mount Grez. In the deepest, darkest days of the freeze, local livestock began to die, ripped asunder and strewn across snowy fields like trash. Wolf tracks larger than any Griger had ever seen led to and from each scene, and at night, high, ghostly howls rose above the shrieking wind, curdling the blood of even the most sturdy men. 

After a watchman on patrol was attacked and gutted in the main square, the men of the village banded together and tracked the beast, eventually cornering it in a cave near a frozen river. Even if he lived to be a thousand, Griger would never forget the monster they encountered. Seven feet tall, coated in matted gray fur, its face canine yet human, its eyes blazed with the fires of hell, and as the men approached, it snapped and snarled, the sounds it made so close to words that even now, Griger wondered if it were trying to speak. They beset it with swords and torches, and when the dust settled, five men were dead and three were wounded. The wolf lay crumpled on the ground, decapitated and aflame. Even with no head, even with its heart divorced from its body, it screeched as the fire consumed it, a high, hitching wail that haunted Griger’s dreams for many moons after. 

Farbin nodded. “I figured as much. A man as well-traveled as you has to have seen such things.”

He went on to explain that a suspected werewolf was loose in the countryside around the village of Koreth, a tiny fishing port on the sloped and muddy banks of the Rey River. Three weeks before, sheep and horses began to turn up dead, their bodies laid open and their intestines pulled from their stomachs. Before long, travelers along the Western Road started to die in a similar manner. Every time a new victim appeared, officials found large wolf tracks and strands of fur nearby. 

Several nights ago, it broke into the home of a land baron and killed him, his wife, and his daughter. His young son survived, but was blinded in one eye. 

 ‘It was a massive beast,’ the boy told the Governor, a personal friend of the baron. ‘It stood seven feet tall, was as wide as it was long, and had the snarling face of a man mixed with a dog.’

 “You want me to kill it,” Griger said. It was not a question.

 “Yes.”

 The carriage jostled as its big wheels splashed through ruts and puddles. “And in return…?”

 “You’ll get a full and unconditional pardon.”

 Hmm. Griger considered the offer carefully, even though he was in no position to bargain. “Alright,” he said at last, “I’ll do it.”

They arrived at the village three hours later. Perched on the banks of the lazy river, it seemed a single estate rather than a town. A stone wall, roughly a dozen feet high, enclosed it, pitched roofs visible beyond. Two guards in helmets and chainmail, swords on their hips and crossbows in their hands, stood at the gate, their expressions stony and as hardscrabble as the fields sloping away from the walls.

Inside, tiny buildings lined narrow dirt streets and people in plain, homespun clothes went about their business, pushing carts, hawking vegetables, and playing dice. Old men sat in canned chairs before the town pub and a group of boys chased each other back and forth through shadowed warrens, their faces smudged and weatherbeaten beyond their years. Chickens and pigs, both plump and hale, ran free, the former flapping their impotent wings and the latter snorting happily as they wallowed and shat. Griger spotted a blacksmith in his quarters, striking an anvil with a hammer, and wondered idly if he had any interesting items for sale. 

“The people here are stubborn and refuse to flee,” Farbin said. 

Griger faced forward. “These types usually are.”

“You are not to worry about their safety,” Farbin warned. “They can see to themselves. Your only concern is to be the wolf.”

“Understood.”

The driver parked near the town inn and tied the horse to a hitching post while Griger and Farbin got out. Griger rolled his neck and flexed his shoulders. After so many years of walking wherever he went, he was unaccustomed to sitting for long periods and inevitably ended any long, stationary trek sore. 

Past the batwing doors, a shadowy lobby lit by candlelight greeted them. Farbin led Griger directly up the stairs and to a tidy room with a single, neatly made bed and a desk beneath the window. “These are your quarters,” Farbin said.

“Spacious,” Griger said unsarcastically. He sat on the edge of the bed. “What leads do you have on this wolf?”

“None beyond what I’ve told you,” Farbn said. “My men have scoured the countryside but they haven’t found a thing.”

Griger hummed. “No tracks? Droppings? Nothing at all?”

“Not beyond what I’ve told you.”

That was odd. Werewolves rarely strayed far from their den. Unless they were of the rare half-breed that turned upon the cycle of the moon, man at day and beast by night. But those were as common as an honest man in the High Council - not very damned common at all. 

“What are you thinking?” Farbin asked.

Griger said what was on his mind. 

“But those aren’t real,” the Governor said, a hint of confusion in his voice.

“I tell you they are.”

Farbin’s brow furrowed with incredulity. “A man cannot simply change his form, nor can a wolf, for that matter. It goes against all logic.”

All Griger could do was spread his hands. That a man - even a large one - could transform into a werewolf (and that a werewolf could shrink back to the size of a mere man) did defy logic. Griger could not account for it, but he knew it to be so, and he said as much. Farbin, shaken by the confidence in Griger’s tone, nervously scratched the back of his neck and looked constipated. “Put aside what you think you know and ask yourself. What if it is a wolf-man?”

“But what if it isn’t?” Farbin countered.

Griger ticked his head to the side in acquiescence. “Maybe it’s not. Maybe your men have failed to uncover a den large enough to house a seven foot tall monster. Maybe they’ve been looking up each other’s backsides instead of where they should be.”

A dark shadow flickered across Farbin’s face. “My men are highly trained and highly skilled.”

“That’s why you came to me.”

Farbin fumed. “I came to you because you have experience in such things.” 

“Right,” Griger said. “I do. And I’m telling you - in my expert opinion - that if there is no den, the wolf is a changeling. I cannot explain the science behind how and why it is a changeling. I don’t know how it can happen...but it does. You have to consider the possibility that you are looking for a phantom, that your wolf may be out there right this second ploughing a field or herding sheep and not asleep in a cave waiting to be found and made.”

Farbin turned away and put his hands on his hips. No shoulder had ever been colder, and for a second, Griger thought the old man was going to send him back to the gallows. “Alright,” Farbin finally said, “suppose it is a half-breed. What then?”

“I want to see where the latest attack happened.”

A half an hour later, Griger and Farbin stood before a large stone house with a slate roof and wide windows. A dirt drive looped around an ornate fountain and tall trees rustled in the new breeze. Several Provincial Guardsmen accompanied them, all with swords and crossbows and one, the commander, with a rare flintlock on his hip. Farbin led Gringer to the west side of the structure. “The wolf came in through the servants’ entrance,” he explained. A set of paw prints led to the door and Gringer knelt to study them. Roughly half a foot apart, they were slightly larger than any other he had seen. 

Inside, the house was dark and cold, shadows clustered in corners like demons waiting for the fall of night to advance their ghoulish aims. Dried blood stained the wooden floors and spackled the bare walls. “Has anyone seen this creature and lived but the boy?”

Farbin shook his head. “No.” His face was white and strained, the somber, funeral atmosphere affecting him. 

“You’ve told me everything?”

“Yes.”

Griger nodded to himself. If the wolf were a changeling, someone, somewhere likely would have seen it coming or going. That was a strike against his theory. On the other hand, there were likely dozens of isolated farms and homesteads scattered through the surrounding countryside. The wolf could be anyone from anywhere. 

“I want to talk to the locals,” Griger said as he and Farbin walked back to the carriage. 

“Right.”

“I’ll also need a team of men at my disposal,” Griger said. “And a sword.”

They were sitting across from each other in the carriage’s enclosed cab. Without, the sky was beginning to cool to purple and evening gloom stealthy crept from the forest. “We’ll get you one.”

“It must be made with silver,” Griger said.

Farbin frowned. “Silver is a poor alloy for sword-making.”

“But it’s the only alloy for werewolf killing,” Griger said. “It shouldn’t be made entirely of silver, but there must be some in it, the more, the better. 

Farbin nodded that he understood.

By the time they made it back to the village, full dark had fallen. The streets stood deserted, the animals locked up for the night and most of the people hunkered in their homes. A few guards walked the lanes and dooyards, bows and swords at the ready, and a stray cat with no tail slunk furtively between piles of refuse, its ears laid flat against its skull and its fur matted and crisscrossed with scars from battles past.

The only activity was at the pub attached to the inn, where lights burned in the segmented windows and the chatter of many voices drifted into the street, occasionally flaring in laughter or song. Apparently, those hearty souls refused to let a wolf stand between them and their end-of-day festivities. 

Griger’s respect for them increased.

Before entering, Farbin and Griger called on the blacksmith, a burly man with a bald head and a mustache that reminded Griger of walruses he had killed and eaten at the top of the world. Griger explained his need and impressed upon the man a sense of urgency. “I need it as soon as you can possibly have it ready.”

The blacksmith nodded gamely. “I’ll have it by dawn.”

Farbin took out his purse and paid, then they made their way to the inn. 

Inside, a roaring fire crackled in the stone hearth and lamps on the walls sent shadows flickering across the floor. A dozen men sat at the bar with stines of beer and a half dozen more occupied the many tables in the middle of the room. A barkeep kept the drinks flowing while a pretty waitress with her blonde hair done up in an elaborate braid like a golden tiara brought trays of beer and pretzels to the tables. 

Griger and Farbin sat at an empty table near the fireplace and Farbin removed his gloves. “Men will make merry even while the world burns around them,” he mused.

“Why not,” Griger said, “they can’t do it in the grave.” 

The women came over and they ordered a pitcher of beer and a sandwich each. While they waited, Griger went to every man one-by-one and asked them about the wolf. They responded, to a man, with an eye roll or a dismissive laugh. None were worried in the slightest. One man lifted his brow in a pitying sort of way and looked Griger up and down as though he were mad. “Werewolves? Why, those were banished from the Realm centuries ago, it’s all much ado about nothing.”

“It’s a big wolf,” the barkeep said, “and dangerous too, that much is fact. But it’s a lot of hysteria. People today are too goddamn soft. In my time, we had wolves and bears too. If they acted out of line, we hunted them down and cut their heads off.” 

The last man Griger came to was a wispy, white-haired oldster with rheumy eyes and three days’ worth of stubble covering his angular chin. Baggy brown clothes, old and wrinkled and caked in the dirt of the field, hung slack from his scrawny frame, and his long, spindly fingers threaded through the handle of his mug like fleshless bone. If Griger had ever seen a man who bore the official title “Town Drunk” he wouldn’t look the part any more than the old man.

 Before Griger could ask him a single question, he spoke in a rusty voice that conjured images of graveyard gates in the dark Province of Helem. “I seen it,” he said, “and it weren’t no regular wolf neither.”

The barkeep sniffed. “You see lots of things, Sel. Like them little pink elephants.”

A wave of mean-spirited laughter ran through the bar, and Sel’s jaw clenched. Griger sensed that Sel was often made sport of at the bar. 

Ignoring the other, Griger asked, “You’ve seen it?”

Sel nodded and held up three fingers. “Thrice, in fact,” he said with a belch.

“Tell me.”

The old timer looked up at him with a twist of suspicion. “Down by the road leadin’ up,” he said. 

“All three times?”

“All three times,” Sel confirmed. 

Once a mason, Sel had moved to the village ten years before to try his hand at farming, he explained. His homestead, comprising five acres, a tumbledown barn, and a decomposing shack masquerading as a house, sat below the walls, in a hollow between the hill and the river. Many nights, he sat on the front porch and “communed with the King” (King Rum, Griger assumed). From that perch, he witnessed “The damned beast” loping toward town. “The first time, I seen’t it over in the road,” he said, pronouncing road as rud. “I have good eyesight and I knew right off it weren’t normal, so I jumped outta my chair and ducked down real low so ways he couldn’t see me.”

Sel couldn’t provide a description of the wolf beyond “near eight damn feet tall and built like a mountain” but Griger didn’t need one. The old man’s story supported his supposition that the wolf was coming from somewhere else and not a den in the hills. Why would it come down the middle of the road each time? The only thing to the south was the river and open fields dotted by stands of forest, all of which Farbin’s men had already searched. 

Werewolves are nocturnal creatures who sequester themselves somewhere dark and dry during the day. Farbin’s men should have found it by now. That they hadn’t suggested that it was a changeling. 

Thanking Sel for his help, Griger went back to the table and sat across from Farbin. “The baron’s house lies in the direction of the river,” he said, more to himself than to the Governor. “What of the other attacks?”

“Mainly in that area,” Farbin said, “why?”

“The changeling - and that’s what it is - comes from across the river. How many homesteads are there beyond the banks?”

 “At least two dozen,” Farbin said. 

 Griger crossed his arms and thought for a moment. “I want your men, tomorrow, out there going door to door with garlic. Make everyone they come across smell it and anyone who sneezes is put under watch.”

 The Governor looked stricken. “But...why?”

 “Changelings are allergic to garlic,” Griger said. 

Farbin pursed his lips in contemplation. “Alright,” he said, “I’ll have them start at first light.”

After dining, they adjourned to their rooms, Farbin on one side of the hall and Griger on the other. A team of six Guardsmen took up position in the empty saloon and kept watch, ready to roll out at a moment’s notice. Griger threw the window open and perched on the ledge, the night breeze washing over him and rustling his graying hair. He rolled a cigarette, lit it with the bedside candle, and looked up at the glowing face of the waxing moon. Tomorrow night it would be full and the changeling would be compelled to turn and hunt as the tide was compelled to crest. It could come tonight still, but unless it was killed, it would return tomorrow for certain, mad with bloodlust. 

Well past midnight, Griger blew out the candle and retired. The mattress was far too soft and it took him nearly a half hour of tossing, turning, and muttering curses to himself to find a position he liked. Once he did, he fell into a light sleep from which he was aroused near dawn by a knock at the door. One of the guards informed him that the blacksmith was finished with his sword, and after dressing, he and Farbin went to collect it. Comprising a simple blade with a guard and a grip, it was far from the most opulent weapon Griger had ever wielded, but it was well-suited to his needs and fit comfortably in his hand.

Back at the inn, Farbin gathered every available man under his command, including the constable and his three deputies, and ordered them to sweep the countryside as Griger had suggested the night before. They showed no reaction despite their lord’s strange request, and departed in a single file line. 

The saloon opened for breakfast at six and Griger and Farbin each had a plate of eggs, bacon, and beans. People began to drift in as they ate, Sel the Drunkard at the head of the pack. The maiden, who quartered somewhere upstairs, came down in a simple white dress beneath a waist apron, and Griger’s eyes tracked her as she carried out her functions. The dress - loose and high cut - revealed nothing of her bosom, but pulled tight across her bottom when she leaned over to set food and coffee in front of her guests. Their gazes met, and her eyes flicked quickly away like two timid minnows in a fish bowl. 

She was beautiful.

She reminded him of someone. 

His mind went back to the jagged mountains atop the world, to a little cabin where weary travellers waited out the snowstorms that raged sometimes for weeks in the winter. There, in one of the most isolated outposts of the Realm, lived a woman Griger had known. She was tall and gaunt whereas the barmaid was average and healthy, her hair was black to the maiden’s blonde, but their eyes were the same breathtaking hazel. Now, staring at his plate, his chest stirred in a way that it hadn’t in years. 

He didn’t like it.

“...else,” Farbin was saying.

“Yeah,” Griger said, as though he knew what Farbin had said. Now, the woman he loved one winter was on his mind and his mood was verging on foul. He recalled the way her hair brushed the creamy slope of her throat when she turned her head, the sound of her laughter, how her heels dug into his behind, urging him deeper unto her. 

He was young, then, and a fool. People, he learned later, come and people go. Loving someone...indeed even hating them...was pointless, for in a breath of summer wind, they’re gone. 

After finishing with breakfast, Farbin requested a metal tub be filled with water so that he could bathe. While he did that, Griger threaded his sword through his belt and walked down to the river, keeping his eyes open for wolf tracks. He spotted a few in the dirt edging the road, all pointing in the direction from which he had just come, and squatted down to examine one more closely. 

Just before reaching the water, Sel’s farm appeared on the right, the main house seeming to sag in the middle as though under the burden of years and the field out back overgrown and gone to seed. The place looked as though it had died, come back to life, then died again. The screen door, which naturally hung askew, banged open, and Sel himself backed out butt first, a ceramic pot in his hands. He turned, saw Griger, and hesitated, then ducked his head and scurried down the stairs, disappearing around the side of the house Griger lingered a moment, then followed, tangles of grass pulling at his boots. In the back, a clear patch boasted several pots like the one Sel had come out with, each blossoming with an assortment of multicolored flowers. Sel knelt before one and heaped rich soil in with his hands. A gust of wind flipped his lank, white hair back and forth, and a satisfied smile played at the corners of his thin mouth. 

“You garden?” Griger asked.

Sel shot him a dirty look. “I do,” he said, a defensive edge in his voice. He stopped, favored the flowers with a sober look, and added, “These plants are the only friends I’ve got.” He chuckled self-consciously.

“Plants seem like they’d make poor friends,” Griger said. “When the first frost comes, they leave you.”

 Sel ticked his head to one side in acquiescence. “Tis better to have loved and lost than not to have loved at all.”

 An image of the girl at the top of the world flashed across Griger’s mind, and for a moment he could feel, feel, her presence. “I don’t believe that,” Griger said. “Loss is hard for a man who’s known love.”

 “Still better than never knowing it at all,” Sel said and got stiffly to his feet. He dusted his hands on his pants.

 “You’ve never lost someone,” Griger said.

 “You’ve never loved someone,” Sel countered.

 Griger stiffened. Mouthy old bastard, yes I have.

 “What do you want?” Sel asked.

 “I wanted to ask you about the werewolf.”

 Sel’s face crinkled. “I told you everything I know.” He started walking back to the front of the house, and Griger fell in beside him.

 “Is there anywhere around here you think a werewolf might live?” Griger asked. “Caves? Dens? Anything.”

 “There’s some caves about,” Sel said, “other than that, I can’t say.” 

 They were on the porch now, Sel holding the door open.

“Can you tell me your story one more time?” Griger asked. “Maybe it might jog something you forgot.”

Sel sighed. “I don’t have nothin’, okay?”

He started to go inside, but Griger stopped him. “Please?” 

The old man looked at him, then sighed. “Fine. Come in.”

They sat in Sel’s tiny and cluttered parlor. The furniture was as old and threadbare as the man who owned it, and the simple walls were crowded with old photos, many of them featuring a smiling woman with dark hair. She looked nothing like the girl at the top of the world, but Griger was reminded of her anyway. “Your wife?” he asked.

Sel, seated in an armchair across from him, busied himself pouring Griger a cup of tea. “Yes,” he said shortly. 

 From his tone - and the woman’s absence - Griger inferred that she was dead. “I’m sorry.”

 Sel’s hand shook as he pushed the cup across the table. “So am I,” he said.

 “Children?” Griger asked.

 “Three,” Sel said. “Two boys and a girl.” Tears crept into the old man’s faded eyes and he fixed his gaze on a point over Griger’s shoulder. Open displays of emotion made Griger uncomfortable, and he shifted in his seat, sorry that he had brought the topic up. “We were married thirty years,” Sel said. His lips trembled and Griger thought he was going to break down crying. Instead, he smiled. “Those were good years.”

 Griger nodded to himself. “I bet.”

 He must not have sounded convincing, because Sel creased his brow. “Are you married?”

 “No.”

 “Ever loved someone?”

 “No.”

 Sel looked at him with a frank directness that bordered on mind-reading, and though it wasn’t possible, Griger could almost imagine the old man was seeing into his mind...and his heart. “You’re a liar.”

 Griger considered his reply for a long time. “When I was a boy,” he said. “I thought I was in love.”

 “What happened?”

 Perhaps the old man had cast some kind of pall over him...or maybe he was in a rare mood...but Griger heard himself answer honestly. “I left her.”

 A heavy silence lay between them.

 “You left her?”

 Griger nodded. “I moved on. She had her ways and I had mine. I didn’t see us working.”

 “You regret it.”

 “Yes,” Griger responded instantly. “I wish I tried.”

 Sel nodded understandingly. “All boys make mistakes. Some are just luckier than others, I reckon.” He laughed, his posture relaxing, and Griger realized he was starting to like the old bastard. 

 “True,” he said. “Now your story…”

 Sighing, Sel lifted a hand. “I don’t have much ways else to say.” He ran through his story just as he had before, with no additions or subtractions. 

 Griger nodded that he was satisfied, and got to his feet. “That’ll be all.”

 Sel walked him to the door and stuck out his hand. “That damned thing’s a monster,” he said as they shook, “you watch yourself.”

 “I can handle a werewolf,” Griger assured him.

Later on, after returning to the inn, Griger and Farbin rode out to meet the men on the other side of the river, catching up to them at a fork in the road. “No one’s sneezed or broken out, sire,” Farbin’s second-in-command, a tall, rodent-faced man, reported. 

 “Expand the dragnet,” Griger said. 

 Rat-face looked at Farbin for confirmation, and the Governor nodded. 

 They would find the wolf...or the wolf would find them.

 Griger wanted the former, but would settle for the latter.

 If he had to.

After that, wala na—puro casual talks and hookups na lang. Natakot na kasi akong masaktan ulit. Kasi after the last girl I courted, I told myself: *Ayusin ko muna sarili ko.* I wanted the next person I meet to see the best version of me.

Honestly, I can handle most emotions. Pero ‘pag pain na… ibang usapan. Pag nasasaktan ako, parang hindi ako makagalaw. My self-esteem drops, and all the progress I made for myself—yung growth, confidence, everything—parang nawawala.

I used to think magaling ako mag-detach. Yung tipong may nakausap ako tapos biglang nag-ghost or umatras, I’d just say “okay, bye” and move on. Akala ko ganun kadali. Then I met this girl sa yellow app. First time in a long time na genuinely na-excite ako sa isang tao. Medyo nakakatakot kasi ang bilis ko nakaramdam ng something. I asked her out on a date—she said yes. Nagdala ako ng flowers. That night, I asked if I could court her—sabi niya yes. We even shared our first kiss that night. First time daw niya mag-kiss ng love interest. She introduced herself to my parents too.

But then, just a few days later, she told me to stop courting her. Sabi niya, she didn’t feel anything for me. Hindi daw siya attracted, walang spark. Gusto niya ako as a person, pero hindi niya ako gusto in that way. One week lang yung panliligaw, pero ang sakit. Kasi for the first time in a long time, I allowed myself to feel something real again. Tapos bigla na lang ganun. What hurt more is that—yung sinabi niya—exactly the same words na sinabi nung girl I courted two years ago. Kaya napaisip talaga ako ""*Ako ba yung problema?""*

I asked her if we could meet for coffee next week to talk. I don’t even know what I’m expecting. Closure? Clarity? Or baka umaasa pa rin ako kahit alam kong hindi dapat.

Hindi ko pa alam. Ang alam ko lang… ang sakit.",17,1749363839.0,OffMyChestPH,5,1.0,False
1l65eh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GarminWatches/comments/1l65eh5/whooplike_health_recommendations_on_garmin_watches/,Whoop-Like Health Recommendations on Garmin Watches?,"I’m a happy user of the Fenix 7X Sapphire Solar, Edge 1050, and HRM strap.

Recently, I got a Whoop 4.0 for a two-month trial - and it made me realize that my Garmin watch is totally fine for me: better battery, better screen, a flashlight… you know the deal.

But -

What Whoop does significantly better is pushing you toward a healthier lifestyle. It asks me to log things like alcohol consumption, number of coffees, how late I had my last meal, etc. And then it gives recommendations on when to go to bed, taking into account all that, including sports activity.

It may sound basic in 2025, but I can already feel how it gamifies me - I want to see those damn recovery and wellness bars turn green! The app also helps me set goals, move more, and train smarter.

So here’s my question:
Is there anything similar in the Garmin ecosystem that I might be missing? App or something?

Because right now, I have the feeling that, despite being 10x less advanced in terms of hardware, Whoop - thanks to its app - is delivering more. The app matters.",8,1749363632.0,GarminWatches,6,1.0,False

* 5/5 LOVEEEEE, would wear often
* 4/5 Like, would wear occasionally 
* 3/5 Nice, but wouldn’t wear 
* 2/5 Not for me
* 1/5 Something is not right

Samples are from Surrender to Chance!

# 🍵 Matchas 

**Sorcellerie Match Made in Heaven:** IMO most of the gourmands from this brand have the same DNA with only a little difference. Hope someone knows what I mean. This was no exception, except for a fleeting 10 seconds of matcha in the beginning. Still, it’s a lovely sweet scent and I’d like to think that this version of the sorcellerie dna is more grounded and “calmer” than the others. 4/5

**D’Annam Matcha Soft Serve:** now THIS is matcha!! A very rich, high quality, GREEN and earthy matcha. I don’t get any soft serve at all. But soon it gets a very alcohol/perfumey smell that reminds me of Elizabeth Arden green tea, which I really don’t like (it reminds me of deodorant). 4/5 for the matcha bit, 1/5 for the rest.

**Maison Margiela Matcha Meditation:** Just like D’Annam, but instead of 100% matcha overtaken by 100% deodorant, this is a mixture of 80% matcha and 20% deodorant. 2/5

**Kilian Princess:** I don’t get any sweetness at all?? 2/5

# 🍦 Vanilla and Sweets:

**Dedcool Mochi Milk:** This was interesting. Like others have said, I didn’t get any mochi from this. It smelled like toasted sugar, similar to Tihota or Vanilla Bean Noel from Cocoapink. But slightly less nauseating. I kept getting whiffs of this all day and I surprisingly didn’t get tired of it. 4/5

**Philosophy Fresh Cream:** FINALLY trying this after months of reading about it here and I LOVE IT!!!! This is whipped cream, nothing else, just cream. Yes. YES 5/5

**Philosophy Fresh Cream Warm Cashmere:** this smells like the BBW champagne toast hand sanitiser I used to have. It’s not like Fresh Cream at all. 3/5

**Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth:** contrary to the name suggests, this is not nauseatingly sweet. I’m bad at picking out notes and this is especially hard to smell. It’s a very sophisticated sweetness. 4/5

**Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth Me Espresso:** I don’t get… any coffee? I can only smell a sweet artificial fruity blend. 3/5

**Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth Caramel Dream:** Again, the caramel isn’t obvious. I can pick out marshmallow. It’s a very soft and enveloping scent. Similar to Sweet Tooth, but I like this more. 4/5

**Maison Mataha Escapde Gourmande:** a really nice vanilla but isn’t any different from the other ones I own. 4/5

# 🍰 Other foods:

**Poesie Village Bakery:** YES! This smells just like the japanese bakery near my house, specifically the milk bread. Love love love. However the sillage and lasting power isn’t great. Does anyone know any stronger alternatives? 5/5

**Poesie Soft:** hmm. I don’t get any rice at all. This smells vaguely like Village Bakery, and the strength is extremely weak. The cap wasn't screwed on properly and the whole bottle leaked into the box, but I still couldn't smell anything. 2/5 

**Masque Milano Madeleine: I**NTERESTING! I’ve never smelled anything like this before. I definitely get the chestnut. There’s also something earthy that makes it slightly medicinal but you have to sniff hard. The drydown is feels so reassuring, like an older sister on a fall day. 3.5/5

**Death and Floral Crunchy Baguette:** I get a rich brioche note, exactly like the ones I used to buy as a child. Very buttery. I like it!! There's some almond in the background which makes it slightly alcoholy at the beginning but it goes away after a few minutes. This scent is strong and I keep getting wafts of it ughhh i love it 5/5

**Imaginary Authors Whiff of Waffle Cone:** Smells like caramelised sugar! Slightly smoky which gives it some depth. But you have to be told that it’s a waffle cone to smell that note. 4/5… upgraded to 5/5 because of how it lasted a whole day, a shower AND one night’s sleep!!!

**D’Annam White Rice:** I definitely get the rice. For a while, there’s something bitter. Then it gets a gluestick type of smell. Cool concept but not something I would wear. 2/5

**Snif Hot Cakes:** This is crazy!!! I can actually smell the pancakes, some berries, and maple syrup. Very realistic. 4.5/5

**Haus of Gloi Ghost Puffs:** WOW!! This is pure white chocolate to me. 4/5 I dabbed it over D’Annam Matcha Soft Serve and IT WORKS!!!!! MATCHA LATTE!!!! 5/5 but doesn’t last :(

**Sorcellerie Cookie Party:** plasticy caramel. :( would be great without the plastic. 2/5 

**Socellerie The Bees are Flying:** honey, dark and pissy at first. Dries down to a light honey with no piss, smells smooth and “round” with some florals in the background. 3/5

**Kyse Fici e Panna:** FIG! And nothing else. A very green fig. Sniffed my arm again after an hour and now it’s just vanilla and sugar. Will have to test again. ?/5

# 🥭 Mangos:

**Phlur Mango Mood body mist:** I did not like this. The mango wasn’t obvious and it smelled very “perfumey” and sharp. Like cleaning product. WAIT I remember what it reminds me of now, it smells just like the bottle of Diptyque’s Oyedo that we keep in the bathroom to spray after laying a particularly nasty turd. I guess that’s why I had such a negative reaction LOL 1/5

**Brown Girl Jane Carnivale:** This still has some cleaning product vibe like Mango Mood, but slightly toned down. The mango here is juicy but fades quickly. 2/5

**Stephane Humbert God of Fire:** again, Oyedo-like smell. Why do all mango perfumes need something citrusy? 2/5

**Xerjoff Cruz del Sur II:** The most tolerable mango out of these. Smells like a mango energy drink. 3/5

**Vilhelm Parfumerie Mango Skin:** just like Mango Mood, mango-cleaning product. Typing this sadly as I eat a ripe mango. All I want  there a perfume that’s just pure mango?? 1/5

# ☕️ Teas:

**Poesie Twice to Tea:** oddly enough this opened with the village bakery note, then changed into a generic body wash scent?? 2/5

**Hexxenacht London Fog:** OOH! This is interesting. Tea isn’t the first thing that comes to mind if I smelled this blind, but once you’re looking for tea, you smell it. I also get a biscuit on the side. There’s also a sweet fruit note without being fruity?? I can’t describe it. 3.5/5

**Arielle Shoshana Sunday:** I don’t get any tea. It smells like overnight rice from the fridge, no sweetness at all. 1/5

**Arielle Shoshana Monday:** nothing but bergamont, then dries down to Imaginary Authors Yesterday Haze. 3/5

**Brandt London Fog:** First thought: PICKLES!! Smells just like Santal 33. Then the bergamont takes over, but in a mosquito repellent way. Dry down is a mix of pickles and bergamont. 1/5

# 🫧 Clean:

**Kenzo Amour:** this smells JUST like Petits et Mamans from Bvlgari. It also reminds me of Replica Bubble Bath / Lazy Sunday Morning. It’s like a soapy baby powder scent, very clean and soft. 3/5

**Diptyque L’Papier:** I was kind of let down by this. I don’t know what I was expecting, but this was a very peppery musk. It reminds me of Zadig and Voltaire This is Her but sharper.  2/5

**Montblanc Signature:** A smooth, fresh unisex smell. Gets sweeter after a while but reminds me of someone who wears it. 3/5

**Zadig & Voltaire This is Her:** Okay, why does everyone say it’s a warm cozy chestnut? This smells like the epitome of a “clean” scent. It reminds me of Glossier You, but I may be wrong since I only smelled You once a long time ago. Same with Dedcook Xtra Milk! To me it’s the cleanest scent ever (I use it specifically on hot days where I just want to feel as clean as possible) and I don’t get any milky notes. Is it just me?? 3.5/5

# Misc: 

**Snif Heal the Way:** This was a weird one. It was like a medicinal vanilla. My mom walking by said that she didn’t like it, and I have to agree with her. 1/5

**Snif Gentle Reminder:** I don’t know what I’m smelling. I don’t get the taro. It’s bitter underneath and reminds me of a massage oil. 2/5

**Diptyque Eau Delle:** a spicy, resinous scent, not my style. 1/5

**Nicolai Saint Honore:** a spicy scent that fades to a creamy scent. I can’t describe it. It’s not sweet but very… round? Just like how NAVA’s Opal Vanilla smells “round”. 2/5

**Serge Lutens Jeux de Peau:** A creamy wood with hay and wheat. Quite masculine, not my style. 2/5

# Next on the lookout for: 

* NUTTY perfumes! Specifically almond milk with no cherry notes. There’s this chinese almond tea that’s just pure creamy almond milk and smells so good, not like the watery stuff in supermarkets. Macadamia nut (SDJ ’71 is lovely but sometimes too sweet), walnut, any nut. 
* Oats!!! I’m addicted to oats. Sometimes I open my jar of raw oats and take a huff. I’ve tried Zoologist harvest mouse but there’s something medicinal about it. I just want something OATY.
* Waffles! Not waffle cone. Just like the buttermilk waffle part from Cocoapink Pumpkin Waffle Delight, without the pumpkin. Or the pancakes from Snif Hot Cakes but with less maple syrup and fruits. 
* And has anyone tried these? Demeter Macadamia nut, BPAL Dana O'Shee, Moonalisa's Mother's Milk",17,1749363426.0,FemFragLab,1,0.91,False
