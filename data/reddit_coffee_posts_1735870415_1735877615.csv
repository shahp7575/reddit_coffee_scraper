1hsdrff,https://www.reddit.com/r/BehaviorAnalysis/comments/1hsdrff/is_there_a_term_for_people_who_like_to_complete/,Is there a term for people who like to complete things in large blocks of time rather than spreading out the same tasks? ,"I (33f) am starting to feel the pressure of having to make the choice of whether I'll have children or not. In my 20s it was a hard no. My current boyfriend has awakened that desire, but as problems in the relationship have arisen and passion has cooled a little, I wonder if I'm suited to family life. I've noticed over time that I really like to focus on one thing and do things in ""marathons."" If I had it my way I'd work  16 hours a day for 3 days so I can have 4 days off. My day is already shot if I work an hour day. I would rather work my ass off for months of my life with no quality of life so I can pay off my debt rather than make a slower steadier progress. I like to paint landscapes, but I'm not going to sit for one hour every night working on one. I lose interest too quickly or life just gets in the way. I need 2 days of uninterrupted time to just do a painting from start to finish.  When I  was single, oncd in a while I  would go on very thorough cleaning sprees until 4am. I didn't want to leave my house after because it felt so clean and nice. I think there is a level of instant gratification that I'm looking for, but I'm willing to put in the same amount of sacrifice/effort as everyone else. I just think it's stupid make things take longer than they need to or do a half ass job.  If I'm given  the space I need to do things in my odd way, I tend to sleep more than most people (10+ hours)  but I'm also a lot more productive. It makes sense that the rest of the world operates on a more incremental scale. I feel like I'm on a different clock than other people.  I worry about the mundane  day-to-day that will come with family life. I won't be able to just work extra hard at parenting for 2 days so I can have 2 off. I need a lot of alone time to recharge despite being quite social.  I think some of this might have started as a cope when I was younger. I didn't like my life and had to do a lot of things I didn't want to, so I learned to work hard and fast and do my tasks well or else I'd have to do them over. The sooner I finished the things I didn't want to do, the sooner I could be left a lone for my leisure/daydreaming. There was also, not much routine except for things I hated, like school lol.  Even when I create art, I don't think I enjoy painting so much as I enjoy having a finished product at the end. Even with kids, I want them more for the adults they will be one day, for that companionship. I don't really value the company of a child, but I could love and invest time into one for future benefit. I want to give a child everything they need and worry about being a stable parent. 
 
P.s. This doesn't mean I hate all routine. I like making my bed in the morning and evening coffee, etc. 

TLDR
Basically I'd rather work twice as hard to have double the leisure time so I can be left alone. I don't want a daily routine with a bunch of stupid tasks when I could knock them out one by one and coast the rest of the week.",1,1735877395.0,BehaviorAnalysis,0,1.0,False

We hit it off instantly having almost everything it common. We both thought it was so insane to find someone that also has niche interests. In the summer we became inseparable and spent almost every day together or calling and we even went to a summer camp together. It got to the point that people called us gay and a couple and would say ""how did you not realize she was flirting"" stuff like that. However in September she had to move across the country for college and when she left I bawled my eyes out. She started becoming more distant and a couple weeks later she said it was because she didn't like how I acted when she left and she felt I took time away from her family and she said she needed space. I backed up and only texted her weekly and we only called 4 times since she left. When she got home from Christmas break I had to practically beg her to hang out and when we finally did it was just like normal, we hung out one more time and I asked her if she just wanted to go to her house and she said she wasn't comfortable with doing that. I was obviously hurt but didn't say anything so we went to a coffee shop instead. After that she dropped me off and when I asked why we couldn't hang out longer it started a fight and then she texted me saying it wasn't working out. I begged her not to do this and to rethink it because we had such a strong friendship and whatever problems we were having I would fix. She decided to end things anyway and I am heartbroken I lover her so much and I think the world of her and I'm not sure how to fix things. I want to reach out but I think I should give it a couple months. ",1,1735877268.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1hsdprb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hsdprb/aitah_for_feeling_weird_about_my_25f_fiances_29m/,AITAH for feeling weird about my (25F) Fiance's (29M) friend (28F)? Really long post ahead.,"Throwaway account as I'm not really a reddit user but I really want some fresh perspective. This issue has been plaguing my mind since a few months ago, so I guess I'll start by sharing context about my relationship with my fiance (Let's call him Alex). We met on bumble back in 2022 and got engaged in 2023. We had been talking about marriage since we started dating so it felt like everything just fell into place when we got engaged even though some people did say it seemed like we were moving too fast. I've always valued clear and intentional communication (something that he struggles with) and often asked questions like ""What do you consider cheating?"", ""What are your boundaries when it comes to exes and friends of the opposite gender?"". I feel like I had to lay all of these out because we come from very different upbringings and wanted to bridge any differences we might have by making it clear from the both of us. He would always give vague answers like ""As long as you don't think you're doing anything wrong."" or ""I'll let you know if it happens."" I took his answers for what they were and moved on. 

I have since met most of his family and friends. A lot of his closest friends being women which I have had no problems with whatsoever and if anything have built close relationships with them as well. We don't live together or live in the same town, but we do make an effort to go to each other when we make plans to meet up with each other's friends. Alex has a bunch of hobbies, one of which is making matcha from ceremonial grade matcha powder (this is relevant, I promise). He has a bamboo whisk and even the special bamboo spoon used to scoop the powder. I had him over for dinner one evening and he offered to whip up some matcha for me to try. We had a great time and he even posted a story on instagram. 

This is where it all starts. Alex has an acquaintance (we'll call her Steph) that is a friend of a friend from college. They never really had a relationship other than being mutuals on instagram so I was surprised when Alex started talking about her in the days after our matcha dinner. Turns out when he posted the story, Steph replied jokingly asking for some and they hit it off right away. They started talking everyday and Alex would sometimes tell me stories about Steph's life. I was confused at first because I had never heard about Steph before but it seemed like he was talking fond of her like they were close. He would bring her up maybe 2 other times before I actually started to remember her name. This was the first time Alex had ever made a new friend since we started dating, so at first I thought nothing of it.  
  
A month later, when I was back in my hometown visiting my folks, Alex tells me that he's meeting up with Steph after work for coffee at a cafe we had never been to together. My immediate knee-jerk reaction is to be bothered that it was just the two of them, but it seemed like they had already made plans so I decided to wait until he came home from them hanging out to talk about it. I felt like maybe I was overthinking everything and I don't know Steph well enough to make a judgement so I didn't want to ruin their meet up. I was under the impression they were catching up after a long time of not seeing each other in college. 

Alex was updating me the whole time until he arrived at the cafe. He even took selfies and pictures of the place to show me while waiting for Steph to arrive. When Steph got there he sent one last selfie of the two of them together and then went radio silent for 3 whole hours. I thought this was weird at first because even when Alex is out with his friends, he always makes time to check up on me or send me a funny meme. I tried not to let it bother me because I do believe that if you have company they deserve your undivided attention. I guess I was just surprised because I had never seen Alex do that for anyone except me.   
  
I heard back from him when he got home and asked if we could call. When we both got on the call, I was waiting for him to start talking about his evening with Steph but he was just making small talk like he didn't disappear for 3 hours. I asked ""Aren't you going to tell me about what happened with you and Steph?"" and at first he paused like he was thinking and then said ""Oh yeah, we just talked about a bunch of stupid stuff"". And kinda just left it at that. I really didn't feel satisfied with that answer and prodded ""what kind of stuff?"". And he mentioned about mutual friends and Steph's failed love life. I still felt like I was missing out on a lot of details but I didn't think I was going to get anything else out of him, so I left it at that. 

After he was done sharing, I took the opportunity to open up that I didn't really feel comfortable that they went out to meet each other, just the two of them, and to a place that he and I had never been to. I always thought that exploring new food places was OUR thing, so I felt left out that I couldn't share this experience with him. He asked me if I was jealous, and while I had never felt jealous of people in the romantic setting, I assumed this was it and admitted that I did feel insecure and needed assurance. He assured me that he wasn't cheating on me and that there's nothing going on between him and Steph. 

They continued to talk everyday and I noticed that I would catch them replying to each other even when we were out on dates, I'd see him sneaking a reply to Steph when we'd get in the car before leaving or while we were hanging out outside. When our anniversary rolled around, Alex had apparently told Steph about our plans so when he started posting stories about us on instagram she'd ask about the places we were at and if we had gone out and done the things Alex shared he planned for the both of us. Needless to say this bothered me and I brought it up when we checked in to our AirBNB for the night to ask who Steph is to him. I was coming from a place where I had never seen him keep daily contact with a person and even extending to our dates and anniversary they wouldn't stop talking to each other. All Alex would tell me is that they're just friends that really enjoy talking to each other. He said she was only asking about how were were and where we were going next and they weren't really having a deep conversation or anything. I felt like something was fishy but I really didn't want to ruin our anniversary by making this a whole fight. I trusted that he was telling me the truth, but I was starting to feel frustrated that it seemed like he wasn't really acknowledging how I was bothered the entire time. 

Fast forward to a week later, Alex and I are attending the engagement party of some friends of mine at the vacation home of another mutual friend. Alex brought his guitar and we all had a fun time jamming. The friend that owned the vacation home was an orchestra guitarist, so we were all excited to hear him play. When he started playing, Alex took out his phone and started recording a short video and at the end pointed the camera at me (I did a little peace sign). I thought he was going to post it on his stories, but he sent it directly to Steph on instagram. I think this tipped me over the edge, but again, to keep the peace and not to cause a scene at my friends' engagement party, I waited until we got home to confront him. 

At this point Alex and I have had a number of small fights about his relationship with Steph. He insisting that there's nothing going on between them, and me trying to point out how he's not treating her like there's nothing going on between them. We're both getting frustrated because neither of us seem to be getting through to each other. He wants to insist he's doing nothing wrong, and I just want him to acknowledge how I feel and set boundaries with Steph. In the middle of it all I asked him if Steph even knows we've been fighting about her and he says he didn't think it was something he needed to bother her with. I told him that he needs to tell her so she's aware and that this would have never been an issue in the first place if he had just introduced her to me properly instead of going off to meet her alone and then creating his own little world with her from their daily conversations. I tell him all I really wanted was to be included. He gets huffy and tells me that I'm practically telling him to cut her off. I had never said that outright because I do also genuinely feel happy he has someone other than me he can connect with so closely, but I wish he didn't neglect my feelings to enjoy that relationship. I tell him that its not that I want them to never talk again, but I want to understand their relationship dynamic better and suggest that maybe he should set for us to meet.

He tells Steph about our fights and opens up that I want to meet her, but Alex said that Steph felt reluctant because of how I might have a bad impression of her already and she doesn't feel like she needs to prove herself to anyone even if she understands where I'm coming from. Alex leaves it at that and says he's not going to force her to want to meet up with me right now, but maybe when she feels more comfortable with it. I agree and ask that instead he involve me more in his relationship with Steph by sharing screenshots of the funny jokes they send to each other so I can be kept in the loop of their inside humor. He agrees and things calm down for a bit. 

A month passes, and Alex and Steph are still talking to each other but not as often anymore. Alex stops replying to her when he and I are together and doesn't send her pictures or videos of things we're doing. Alex also starts sending me screenshots of things they talk about. I thought I would be happy with this, but I still felt left out because they had this weirdly close bond that I couldn't really pick out if it was innocent or romantic and really wanted to meet Steph so I could see what this girl is really all about and why Fiance can't bear to not talk to her. At this point though, I was exhausted and scared to lay out all my vulnerable feelings again because I didn't want him to invalidate me and suggested that maybe we should do couple's therapy to address all the underlying issues that his relationship with Steph had brought up. 

Alex agrees and we go to our first session. The therapist points out that Alex does have a weird fixation with Steph and tries to ask him why that is. Alex explains that the two of them share a sense of humor that he doesn't get with anyone else (not even me) and he really enjoys sharing that with Steph. Our therapist acknowledges thats fine but asks him why he's protecting his relationship with Steph over me. Alex was confused by it at first, but the therapist continues to explain that whenever I bring up my feelings and he decides to do nothing but invalidate me, he's protecting his relationship with Steph and neglecting his relationship with me. I think something clicked in the both of us then and I had finally realized why I had always felt so left out and bothered. He really was prioritizing another woman in our relationship. Alex says he'll try to talk to Steph one more time to meet up with me and if she refuses, he'll cut her off. We all agree that as long as that is a decision that he chooses and genuinely thinks is best, then it should work out. 

Alex drafts a really long message to Steph pointing out how he and I had still been fighting about her but admitted that he fell short in trying to include me in their relationship and ended up hurting me in the process and that he would cut her off so that I wouldn't need to overthink about their relationship anymore and she wouldn't need to be burdened about feeling like she's the reason why we fight. A few days later, Steph only reacts to his long message with a teary-faced emoji but doesn't reply. 

Fast forward to New Year's and Steph sends a message to Alex saying ""Thanks for being apart of my 2024, I hope we'll still know each other in 2025!"". As of writing, Alex hasn't replied and I'm catching myself in a downward spiral again. Alex and I talk a little about how things haven't really been the same since we started fighting about Steph and I'm anxious that if not with Steph, but what if a new friend comes along and he starts building a new connection that he leaves me out again. I was expecting assurance that he knows better now, but then he said ""I don't think I'll ever find a friend like Steph again. I've never met anyone like her in my age group and really think I will ever connect with someone in terms of humor the same way I do with her.

Reddit, I'm lost. I've given him opportunities to keep his friendship with Steph as long as he's mindful of me, but he insists he has no choice in order to protect our relationship. Should I just let it go that he basically described Steph as his one that got away and be happy he's prioritizing our relationship? Or am I the AH for dwelling on how it seems like he's forcing himself to be with me and letting go of what he seems to be describing as his soulmate? ",1,1735877249.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I have found much comfort on this thread. In the last few months I have posted  less frequently as my manifestation of grief has veered from much of what is described by others. 

The grief is there and potent but has changed from a sting to living with a chronic disease. It's just there.

Additionally, the awareness  of,  ""the void"" is how my grief is most often manifest now.

Example, the work holiday parties I went to last month. For the first time in my life, I noticed that everyone in the room was with someone but me. I don't even think like this! I have walked into a million rooms, and this never crossed my mind. 

Don't get me wrong, I didn't want their person, I just became aware that there would be no discussion on who would be the designated driver before dinner. I was It by default.

Example, I went on vacation for a couple of days. Someone brewed me an individual cup of coffee and brought It to me. The emotions were so strong that I didn't want to meet their gaze lest they get the wrong impression.

This journey is challenging at the strangest times, in the strangest ways.  I am invested in life. I have friends, commitments, travel. I can celebrate the joy of others, from a mental distance.  

And yet, there are moment when I ""thirst"" for comfort, not cry with grief.

The relationship is a bit odd because in the first month of us seeing each other her baby daddy passed away unexpectedly. She is not from here and has limited family and relationships. I dropped everything to try and be supportive. Be around as she needed. Buying groceries. Trying to keep her child occupied and taken care of. During this time I have put my family, friends and other relationships second as she does not have a support network here. I have tried to encourage her to get involved in things, coffee with an old friend, join the gym, get your hair done.. anything that will get her out of the house. She does not handle this well and tells me it's all to soon. She is constantly upset with me telling me I am not a good partner because I want to do something other than sit on the couch. I am ok with sitting on the couch sometimes. I really am. Just not the entirety of my time off. She makes me feel like any relationships I have with family are weird. Like I shouldn't have them. She makes me feel like I should only be available to her at any time she calls. I go to her house often. She hates my house so she doesn't come over to mine (it's small). I cook for her as she doesn't have the energy. I do her dishes, take her garbage, do all the stuff even though I have my own place to look after as well. I need to be clear, this is just highlighting the imbalance, I do not mind helping! I know this isn't healthy but I have been dealing and coping as I know she is grieving and we didn't know each other well before this man passed. We are a year in and I don't see a lot of changes in her process. Grief is a terrible thing but at some point does a person have to start to work on moving forward? I'm not at all saying that she should just be over it.. I wouldn't be.. but it's like she wants me to be a partner but she doesn't want to be. I am so very exhausted of the weekly fights and put downs and the couch. Part of me really wants to be with her because she can be funny and fun and kind. But as quick as a snake she turns mean and selfish and vile. I don't want to live my life like this but how long is long enough? 

Is there anyone out there who has maybe gone through something similar that can offer insights? Or AITA and should continue to listen to spite anger and sadness if I truly care about her. (I do love her, that's why this is so upsetting) I mean maybe I am just being selfish.. help!",1,1735877153.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

It’s been almost a year and I talk to her as if we are friends but i feel like I’m pushing it and kind of faking because that’s what I want. I asked her about being friends again befor and she said yes but she may have changed her mind and to me doesn’t seem she is keen or wants to or she’s still upset?! Etc. 

She got upset we had our disagreement and she quit talking to me. There have been moments we reconnected for a bit but it’s never been the same. There have been glimpses of hope she wants to be friends again. She had asked for space but wow how much space/time does a person need? 

She has at least one other good friend now. Because of the timing it kind of hurts sometimes because it was around the time we stopped talking so I feel she replaced me. But that’s silly and unhelpful for me to think though I do sometimes feel jealous because they are close and she says she loves her. In a way it gives me hope she can or will love me as I know I am just as kind and just as loving and can be a good friend just like her if given a chance, and I have my own unique personality and benefit only I can provide. I feel a year is plenty of time and space to forgive me. I apologized and expressed how I feel and how much she and our friendship means to me. I’ve tried to see things from her perspective. I’ve given her compliments and in the past small gifts. I offered to treat her for her birthday when things were good. More recently I have brought up things people and pictures that helped us connect and remember the past. I have given her my contact info just in case and suggested we hang out or get together perhaps for coffee when she is ready. I’ve told her little life updates about my day and asked about hers. I’ve encouraged her professional life and done my best to stay out of her personal life though I haven’t been perfect as it Ms been an area of dissent. I’ve complimented her about her internal and external beauty. I’ve told her I will always be there for her and love her unconditional and that there is no pressure for when/if she wants to talk. 

All of this with little in return. At one point in the beginning she had blocked me so idk if I’m blocked now but she has responded since then so my guess is no. A year is a long time and while things may not ever be the same I thought we would be further along in our friendship by now. Maybe she’s not ready? Maybe she doesn’t want to be friends again after all and changed her mind. Should I ask her? Is a year too long to wait? ",1,1735877094.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1hsdkh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1hsdkh7/matcha_and_adhd/,Matcha and ADHD?,"I'm in my early 40s and was diagnosed with ADHD a year ago. I tried meds but they were all sorts of wrong for me so finally stopped. I have never liked coffee but I drink black tea daily (good quality rare tea... not Tetley etc). I used to drink a lot of green but after my son was born a few years ago I switched to black for whatever reason. About two weeks ago, I randomly switched to green as we were away visiting my parents and that's what they had. Almost immediately I noticed a big difference in how I feel and function during the day! So I looked into it and of course discovered the L-theanine connection.

Anyway! I'm wanting to start making matcha at home (I do enjoy it but have never made it myself) because of the higher L-theanine levels. I'm going to go out this weekend and find all the things to start doing it myself (I'm in Canada) but I'm curious to hear from others if matcha actually helps you with focus, motivation, etc? I'm afraid that I'm hyping it up too much! But also excited about creating an almost ceremonial tradition/habit for myself, whether it helps or not.

1hsdjgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1hsdjgo/feeling_so_frustrated_that_i_dont_have_a_friend/,"Feeling so frustrated that I don't have a friend group, and can't seem to get one no matter how hard I try. ","I would consider myself a fairly attractive guy - I'm 28 years old, over 6 ft tall, I work out, and I get 2-4 matches per day on dating apps. I'm also a friendly and have a good sense of humor. But I've never had a core friend group. I have individual friends who I'll catch up with 1 on 1, but I'm not a part of their friend groups, and I don't have a main friend group of my own. So they'll meet with me for drinks or a coffee from time to time, but they'll spend most of their social time with their own friend groups which I'm not a part of. For as far back as I can remember, I've craved the idea of having a group of 3 or 4 really good friends who I could regularly hang out with, go on trips and make memories with, and who would have my back just like I'd have theirs. I'm an only child so I don't even have any siblings to hang out with, which makes me crave a friend group even more. It seems like such a normal thing that most people take for granted. But the older I get, the more I realize that I might never get to experience this.

I'm an extremely loyal person by nature. I go out of my way to help people, even if they don't ask for it. But they never do the same for me. For example, one of my so-called friends recently asked me if I could give him some tips for an upcoming job interview, since I have pretty good interview skills. I took time out of my day to get on a call with him and spent almost 3 hours walking him through interview techniques and giving him various tips that helped me land a job. The next day, after the interview was over, he didn't even bother texting me to let me know how it went. He wouldn't have even said anything if I hadn't followed up to ask. Situations like these just make me feel like my ""friends"" only reach out if they need something, yet they're never here for me in the same way when I need them.

I'm also always the one reaching out to initiate plans. If I don't reach out and ask to catch up, my friends almost never invite me to things or suggest that we hang out, because they have their own friends group that I'm not a part of. It makes me feel so invisible and unwanted, even though I know that I'm desirable because I have a pretty active dating life and have no trouble getting attention from women. But when it comes to friendships, for whatever reason I always feel like the kid who gets picked last in gym class, no matter what I do.

In 2024, I went out of my way to try to make new friends and be adopted by a friend group. I went to a bunch of social events where I didn't know anyone just to try and make new friends. I did meet some new people who invited me to hang out with them, but they were all part of a group who'd known each other for 10+ years and were BFFs, and I felt like the odd one out. I did join a couple of their hangouts, but I always felt like an outsider. They had their own group chat which I wasn't a part of (understandable because they'd known each other since freshman year of college), and even though I tried to keep the friendship going, eventually we just faded out of contact. And when I texted one of them again after a while of not seeing each other, I was ghosted and left on delivered.

I know I'm a good person, and I always go the extra mile for my friends (or the people who I like to think are my friends). But I've never even so much as been invited to a new year's party before. Leading up to this New Year's all I wanted was to finally know what it was like to be included in something. To be invited to a new year's party and get to celebrate the new year with people who weren't my parents or relatives. But not a single person reached out to invite me to anything. I tried suggesting to my individual friends that we do something for new years when I saw them 1 on 1 in December, and they all said ""yeah sounds good!"" and then went on to plan their own parties with their own friend groups. And once again I was left out.

I'm going to be 30 in 2 years, and I've never experienced what it's like to have a best friend or a group of best friends. I'm just so sick and fed up of seeing everyone on social media posting all these pictures with their friend groups for new years, and meanwhile I didn't even have a single person to celebrate it with. I don't understand why everyone around me seems to have a core group of friends, and even multiple groups of friends, and yet no matter how hard I try, I can't get one of my own. I just want to feel like I belong, but I'm starting to lose hope that I'll find a friend group, and that I'll just have to be content with feeling alone for the rest of my life.",1,1735876708.0,rant,0,1.0,False

Gotta say, when I first started it was crazy. As a 16 year old, was lucky to get this job I could say. Pays $13/h Put me in quite a deep end.

Useful I would say because I learnt a lot on how to use Excel. How to format it to use for different inputs, formatting a entire excel sheet to format it to do a lot of stuff.  But mostly what shocked me was the amount of info someone needs to acquire & keep in their mind in one day.

First day, HR introduced me to the staff in my department, then the person I would be working under, lets name him AJ. Then the first day he asks me what my background is, I tell him I just finished O levels. But he goes asap into what need to do, how to contact suppliers, how to use their Microsoft ERP system and then make it read data from the Excel file directly.  
  
First day I was overwhelmed, made tonnes of mistakes. Got berated time to time by AJ, but I would say he is professional with me. He had standards that he wanted me to uphold. Once I got to know AJ, he introduced me to some of the general managers as well.

The general managers welcomed me in, on second day one of them treated me to coffee as a welcome gift I would say. Had quite a number of chats with them, but definitely guarded in how I interact with them. Because one of them, he is unfiltered. He is swearing left right, not maliciously, but he just speaks that way. Sometimes asked me, if AJ is a competent person or not, I only answered I am learning, nothing more nothing less.

But one thing I got to learn & experience is really something known office politics and how 2 faced people can be. There are 2 aunties in the office, both of them are nice to me. But I saw the real live how 2 faced people can be. But the moment either of them leave their seats, they turn around badmouth each other. Same thing didn't comment or ask any questions, only responded with oh ic. Stayed out of office politics, peoples conflicts keeping my head clear of all these things.

Also learnt other skills. Previously, didn’t know how to ask for help or say no. Even though I get scolded by AJ couple of times, learnt couple of concrete experiences that I think will be useful going through later in life and in poly also.

First thing I learnt is how to say no. Why because one of those aunties gave me their work which they wanted me to do. I had no idea that I shouldn’t be doing their work, because its unrelated to my overall daily tasks. AJ then comes over then asks me what am I doing and I show him. He tells me I shouldn’t be doing this work at all, but lets me finish it. He then pulls me aside in the meeting room and tells me I should learn to say no appropriately. He told me I knew that it is out of scope for me, then why did I hesitate to say no. Should use my brain to think & say no at times.

Second thing I learnt is to always ask questions & seek clarification. Don’t guess or assume anything. Because one time I was issuing a invoice to a customer, then I did not know what process number to put. Whether put the customer’s invoice number or the company side invoice number. I assumed that since its customer, put customer invoice number and then I emailed it. After I sent it, got berated by him. Should instead put both the company invoice number and the customer invoice number so the company can have it for future reference. Told me why didn't I ask before I send, because now need apologize to customer then get them to resign it again. He told me its rather better to get berated and then keep it in memory rather then making a mistake then re-doing it because its extra work for you.

Getting this job honestly right after finishing O level, is quite a life changing experience I would say, especially this being my first job. A complete 360 that wasn't even taught in sch. Got exposed to a whole list of different things. I had to hold my own weight, think & improvise, how to drown out noise and focus on actual work.

Still have another 3.5 mths to go before I start poly & finish this job. Hopefully the skills I pick up not only Excel skills but also skills I learnt with dealing with people can apply it in some ways in poly and in the future",5,1735876492.0,SGExams,3,1.0,False

1hsdfef,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1hsdfef/shitty/,Shitty,"It was fuuucking cold last night. My feet warmed up after a bit. The rest of me was so-so all night. Lack of calories seemed to make different spots on my body decide to get cold. The back of one arm, then a small spot on my leg, then a butt cheek, etc., alternating all night. 

I'm pretty sure I slept for a bit but it wasn't for more than an hour at first. A few minutes here and there throughout the night. I kept tucking the tarp under me. My hand painfully freezing every time it was sent out of my sleeping bag.

Around 5:15am I get woken up by the semi tractor next to me firing up. I don't know if you know what an old semi starting up when you're between it and another trailer sounds like, but it's LOUD! All I could think was, 'Don't run me over. Please don't run me over. Please don't run me over.' I'm pretty sure dude knew I was there because he idled it out as quiet as he could. I give sleeping another try. Caught a little bit.

Around 7:30 I come to. I don't want to but I need to get up. It's time to get this day started. There's ice in my tent from me breathing. Open the window. Light a smoke. Everything's frozen. Coat goes from pillow to coat. Brrrr! Belt on. Damn that's cold. Change in change pocket. Another frozen spot. Wallet. Knife. Phone. Hat. Cheap knit gloves. Smokes. Lighter. They're starting to warm up but I'm cussing humorously with each addition. Get my gear together. Me and gear out of the tent.

The ice thaws before I exit. I decide to shake out my rain fly and break down my tent gloves off. I can dry my hands, and don't want wet gloves all day. It's 28 degrees out with a breeze blowing. Hands instantly freeze and start to hurt. I get the tent back in the bag, dry my hands on my pants. Gloves on. 'That's a little better.' Gear on. Cross the lot. Cross the street to the gas station.

'Find coffee.' Every step seems like a serious challenge. Can't find sugar. It's right in front of me. Creamer, no problem. Coffee stirrers? Nowhere to be found. Lids... Uuuuh... There they are. I pour my freshly made struggle coffee from one cup to another and back again several times. Toss extra cup in trash. Now food.

Regardless of what I was told doesn't seem to be much here. Chicken, Pizza sticks, and grits with or without cheese. No tables to sit at. 'I don't want to deal with chicken right now.' Three pizza sticks a cup of coffee and some cheesy grits. Paid. Back outside to eat. 

Fuck it's cold! Around the building to the sunny side out of the wind. A couple guys, different color, sitting there looking like they had a good night and a rough morning. ""Good morning"" I say. Good mornings all around. We make small talk while I'm eating. These old guys are jokingly talking shit and telling eachother stories and cracking me up the whole time! Food. Coffee. Smoke. Coffee. Stories. Coffee. Nice morning other than the cold.

I decide it's too fucking cold up here. I'm not properly geared. My advice to anyone this time of years is to go south. As much as I know I will get what I need on the road I don't want to suffer through another cold as hell night. It will be a high of 29 by Monday here. My goal is almost another state north. I admit to myself I made a mistake and decided to go back south. Should be no problem getting a good ways south today.

Ha! The universe is not having it today.

I say goodbye. Head back the way I came. Out to the road. Gear down. Thumb out. An hour later I decide to check maps to see what is south of me and realize this highway splits east and west a ways south of me. 'No wonder a couple people gave me really weird hand gestures.' Gear on. Walk a quarter mile-ish. Gear down. Thumb out.

Over the next hour I realize I'm seeing cars coming from the west continuing north but not from the west going south. Maps. Fuck. That road is still south of me. Gear on. Walk another quarter mile-ish. Gear down. Thumb out. 

About fifteen minutes later a black girl from Georgia stops. ""I'm just going to the next town. You'll have to ride in the back."" ""No problem. Thanks!"" Gear in back of truck. Hitchhiker in back of truck. We're off. 'Finally. Let's get this show on the road.' Seven miles later I get dropped off. Me out. Gear out. Mutual waves through back window. 

First ride of the day is always a spirit lifter. The momentum has built to get you on your way. Forty-ish miles and it will be a little warmer. It's already slightly warmer here. An hour of riding and it will be better. Here we go.

Walk to the end of tiny town. A little more going on here but not much. Gear down. Thumb out. I missed a couple OCD things while packing up this morning. I tidy up. People are waving. Some are enthusiasticly smiling and waving like they love what I'm doing. First ride accomplished. Gear tidy. I have a hundred followers on Reddit in a few days. It's warming up a bit. People like reading about what I'm doing. I'm feeling great! Life is good!







I stayed in that spot alllll fucking, day! I tried every trick I could think of. I kept hope with the knowledge that somebody will eventually stop. Sometimes it's just a numbers game. If I'm crazy enough to hitchhike, somebody's crazy enough to pick me up. Not today bitches. Not today.

I decided to forgo food this afternoon to not miss the one ride that might come through. 

Sun's down. I'm going to eat. Dollar General. Get food. Find outside outlet. Sitting near warm building stuffing my face. I'm saying hi to all the locals. I recognize every one of them from watching them all day. Nice people. I'm feeling a little better. The old guts start a rumbling. 'I'll just find a bathroom.'

""No you won't"" says the universe. Of the two places in town that would have -and damn well legally because they serve food should have- public restrooms, both have signs saying ""No Public Restrooms."" I go in anyways. In my absolutely politest, nicest, best way I inquire if I can use the restroom. ""No. Sorry."" ""I'm not from here. I'm just traveling through. I don't know anyone here. Can I please use your restroom just this once?"" ""No. No public restrooms."" 'Fuck. This train does not stop. Nor is it going to.'

I'll spare you the gory details but... Shopping bag, behind building in a shadow, very close houses with no fences, dog barking at me because he hears me, hoping to not get caught, bag in dumpster. No mess for someone to find. Free hand sanitizer at DG from cashier.

""Some days you eat the b'ar. Some days the b'ar eats you.""


A word from the author...

Holy freaking moly you guys!!! I knew some of you would like this, living vicariously through us vagabonds and all. But damn! I am feeling the love! Thank you guys sooo much for all the kind words! I try my best to get back to all of you. If I don't say something to you know that I've read your comment and you have my deepest thanks! (I've been spending until after midnight trying to get back to you all, and a few hours during the day and next evening.) Don't ever think I don't read your comment and appreciate every one. But a hitchhiker's gotta hitchike. You guys have really brought me a lot of happiness! I don't know if cathartic is the right word but being able to talk to you guys a little bit here has made a sometimes brutally rough journey a bit easier.

Thank you!!!!!!

P.S. To the mods... Thanks for removing shitty comments. It's gotta be real work on these long posts with everything else you have to do. I appreciate it!

It truly has been a godsend. Unfortunately, I have a more serious health condition and the medication for that condition has an X-level drug-drug interaction with Modafinil.

The problem is that because Modafinil induces the enzyme CYP3A4, it basically nullifies any therapeutic benefits of the new medication. 

I'm completely devastated. I'm trying to get into my neurologist, but the earliest available appointment is in late February.

What I'm hoping this sub might be able to help with is suggesting some medications I could bring up during my visit as alternatives. My issue isn't with sleep onset. Instead, it's the excessive daytime sleepiness. I feel completely miserable and exhausted and grumpy without Modafinil. Even multiple cups of coffee don't help.

A few considerations before making your suggestions:
1. I'm U.S.-based and if the prescription doesn't have an FDA-approved DSPD use, then it needs to be less than $50 out of pocket with GoodRx. My insurance provider refused to cover Modafinil, even after appealing because using Modafinil for DSPD is considered experimental.
2. Armodafinil (Nuvigil) has a similar X-level warning.
3. I also need to discontinue light therapy due to the new medication's side effect of extreme photosensitivity.

I just want to invite everyone to come hang out during the streams and let's chat about Godzilla and kaiju. I collect random Godzilla merch and love all the movies and lore, and want to share that joy with other fans.

I'm looking for some advice on my first order from September Coffee! I want to buy 4 bags in total and I'm particularly interested in including a thermal shock process coffee. I'm currently torn between Candy Cane Bark and Buttercream for that one.

For the other three bags, I'm considering:

\- Kianyagi AA

\- Los Capachos Lot 2

\- Genji Challa

I plan to brew these using a V60/ZP6 or a DF54/Bambino.

Has anyone tried any of these coffees? Which thermal shock option would you recommend, and do you have any thoughts on my other selections? Thanks in advance!",0,1735875641.0,pourover,4,0.33,False

1hsd6nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruises/comments/1hsd6nd/recent_liberty_of_the_seas_cruise/,Recent Liberty of the Seas cruise ,"I made the mistake of reading the reviews 2 days before my trip (dumb, I know), so I was a little nervous but I can't think of a time I have been more pleasantly surprise than my recent Christmas cruise on Liberty of the Seas. This will be a detailed breakdown, along with some tips and some lessons learned. We had an amazing time and, from someone who is not easily impressed, I recommend this cruise/itenerary/date to any family. 

1.  Embarkation: cannot believe how smoothly this went. We arrived in Fort Lauderdale early the same morning and, though we were scheduled for the latest time to board, we were able to get on 4 hours early with zero issues. There was no line, everyone was so friendly, we were ushered on to the ship immediately. We could not access our room for several hours so tip: pack an entire outfit (likely for the pool) in your carryon. We changed quickly, grabbed drinks and headed to the pool. 

*American Airlines has several flights across different cities that ONLY fly nonstop to and from FLL and/or Miami. Mine was in DFW so it always seamless, is on-time 91% of the time and it's a well-oiled machine. Highly recommend if available. There are so many opinions about flying in same-day so I was so anxious and worried. It was the easiest travel experience ever, even on December 23rd. We took the 7am out of dfw and landed 15 mins early, took an Uber 7 minutes to the port and we're I. The hot tub about 30 mins later, drink in hand. 

**A FEW DAYS BEFORE YOUR CRUISE, MAKE CERTAIN TO PURCHASE DRINK AND EXCURSION PACKAGES AT THE DISCOUNTED RATE. If using AMEX, DOUBLE CONFIRM the charge. They have consistent issues with Amex rejecting the charges and don't alert you, so you board the ship thinking you are set only to pay full price for what you think you reserved, purchased, etc. This is the only aspect I advise NOT using Amex (love you, Amex, sorry!). My charge was ""pending"" but cancelled and I had to pay full price for drink packages and water park (about a $500 difference in total) and I was pissed at first, seemed scammy, but the team was very helpful in getting things remedied. Kiddos to Arthur in guest services. This man is so patient, kind and helpful. 

I'm going to breakdown all aspects to cover our experience and to address some of the mixed reviews: 

Condition of this ship: yea, it's old. It's the next up for an overhaul, but honestly I didn't care. I have seriously high standards on sanitation/ cleanliness, presentation, vibe, etc and this ship passed with flying colors. The ship was spotless, crews cleaning and shining at hours of the day and night. Some reviews mentioned areas that had mildew or smelled like urine, I literally never even saw the slightest hint of anything close. We parked next to the brand new utopia of the seas at coco cay and, despite the majesty of the UOS, I still have such a special place in my heart of Liberty. 

Christmas cruising: HIGHLY recommend. The ship was beautifully decorated, really just amazing. Plenty of places for photo ops, SO MANY holiday events. You could jump in and enjoy the spirit but also plenty to do away from it. They had midnight candlelight mass and haunukah services and all kinds of ice skating shows, performances to celebrate the season, etc. Santa landed at 7am on Christmas morning and gave out presents to the kids. *another aspect I really appreciated about this cruise is announcements were confined to the halls so you weren't awoken at the crack of dawn for shit you didn't care about. 

Lastly with this, I may never decorate my house or spend another holiday season NOT at sea. It was awesome. 

Cleanliness: my room was spotless. I am a relentless psychopath about this so I don't don this title lightly. Our sheets were clean, the bathroom had been sanitized, everything smelled clean and Wayan our room attendant was so helpful. The little towel animals he left on my son's bed were so adorable. The room was small but I was shocked by the amount of drawers and closet space (with hangers). The room included a hair dryer and a surprisingly powerful shower with great pressure and temperature. Plus, the vanity has tri-mirrors and great lighting. I have nothing but good things to say about the room. I am very cold matured so I suggest requesting extra blankets if you are too. Are the beds the most comfortable? No. But the pitch dark room with the slightest rocking of the ship will lull you to the best sleep of your life. 

Food: The food was fantastic. Now, I'm never going to eat cold cuts anywhere and there was a charcuterie offering that I did not sample, but otherwise I was wildly impressed. The glass in the buffet areas is LOW so they did not gross me out at all. Breakfast was delicious, the French toast, the fruit and really the variety of food was really amazing. Christmas Eve dinner included a roasted turkey carving station and all of the traditional sides. There were always TONS of vegetarian options plus the fruit options were impressive. They literally have something for everyone including Halal options and lots of Indian food as well. I read a lot of reviews about terrible food but I thought it was really amazing. They serve Lavazza coffee throughout the ship and it was always fresh brewed and delicious. The dining room door was amazing as well.
I would highly suggest reservations. We only ate at one specialty restaurant, Johnny Rockets. We are outside as the ship pulled out (HIGHLY RECOMMEND WITNESSING THIS ENGINEERING FEAT!)and had the best burger and shake ever. They have a $18 cover but we didn't pay much over and the food was awesome. Serrento's pizza was delicious. Nothing over the top special but the pizza was always hot and fresh, plus the Starbucks anchors the restaurant so it was always and easy, delicious option all hours of the day/night. Plus they serve free breakfast pastry options in the morning (the cinnamon and sugar donuts were layers of yeast and goodness!) Hard A- on the food and again I am a TOUGH critic. 

Pool and hot tubs were a blast. The bartenders were fast and friendly. Special shout out to my main men Fred and Peter. They were hilarious, greeted me by name and made some of the best specialty drinks ever. I highly recommend the drink package if you plan to booze and relax, if even for the convenience alone. The drinks are strong and they have a great selection. They feature some fun pineapple drinks and daily specials too. Note: I was not aware but RC allows you to bring two bottles for your room on the ship. 

On-ship activities: tons to do. The slides were the only disappointing thing on this ship. They were old, no water pressure, and are NOTHING like the videos. The wave sim was super fun and the pools, splash pad/obstacle course offer enough fun. Plus there are ice cream stations all over so the kids had a blast. There's also a basketball court, fabulous bands playing all day and poolside movies at night. So fun to watch Christmas movies in the middle of the ocean of Christmas Eve!! Pulling out of port is a whole party, reggae band playing, it's really just a blast. You'll immediately be happy you booked this vacation. 

Service on the ship: immaculate. Truly impressive. Never had a single issue. All smiles and so committed to service. 

Stops: 
Nassau: Eh. But really my fault. I did zero research and it showed. My suggestion is NOT to settle for Junkaroo beach (aptly named). Walk straight off the ship and quickly through the tourist area complete with $20 ice cream and $50 drinks. Your best bet is either to head to one of the resorts or catch a cab to Cabbage Beach ( next to Atlantis), you willl never forget the beauty. Chairs, towels, drinks and white sandy beaches. 

Coco Cay: ACTUALLY a perfect day. The island is divided between the water pack (complete with one of the tallest watersides in the world and VERY FAST) and the lagoons and secret beaches, kid beaches, adult only lagoons and excursions. This island is so lush and beautiful! I would HIGHLY suggest the water park for the older kids because it is the jam. The slides are treacherous and fun and it will not disappoint. The food on that side was awesome. Plenty of seating with umbrellas, lockers, etc. The private beaches were amazing. Plenty of seating with umbrellas and the food was fabulous. Tacos, Philly cheese steaks, fruit, desserts, the bars are all over the beach with easy access. I could have stayed on coco cay for two days, it was so beautiful. Laid out perfectly, the lagoons were idyllic and the weather was perfect. Apparently RC offers weekend cruises just to coco cay for 3 days and I would absolutely do it!

Nightly events: there's an adventure club for kids, divided in different ages which was handy and the kids loved it. Arcade is pretty ok. We went to a few comedy shows and name that tune game shows, they were actually really fun. There were parades and nightly performances, bands and ice skating shows that I had no interest in, but there is no shortage of things to do. Pickleball seemed to be a huge hit. I loved the digital menus at every elevator. Made navigating the ship and planning your day so easy. 

Medical station: very clean, very helpful. It is $250 to see a doctor and the care is decent. Like I said, take your own meds and definitely get travel insurance. 

Disembarkation: could not believe how smooth and EASY this was. It took 25 minutes to get down the ship, checked out and through customs. It's so impressive how well-oiled this machine really is. 

I wish I could explain how snobby I actually am. I typically can't stand crowds and normie, pedestrian stuff. I need my comforts and things need to be spotless and sanitary...I loved this entire experience. I let my kid choose the trip and I had my fingers crossed for Italy but this vacation was fun, relaxing, enjoyable and worth every penny. I honestly can't wait to take another cruise and will definitely go with Royal Caribbean. 

*bring snacks for the room. Pringles are $7 and the options at the general store are sparse. 
*pack meds like cortisone cream, benedryl and ibuprofen. The medical station is expensive. 
*DO buy travel insurance. I purchased through Allianz, it was cheap and easy. I had a claim, uploaded my bill through the app and was reimbursed 5 days later. Amazing, really. Highly recommend. 
*don't forget to pack hoodies/sweaters for nights in on the deck, it can get chilly. Trust me, you'll use them.

1hsd6n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1hsd6n0/oatly_otly_dd/,Oatly ($OTLY) DD,"The company was founded in 1990s in Sweden by a professor investigating alternatives for “lactose intolerance”. The management under Toni Patterson rebranded, expanded and successfully IPOd the company (between 2010-2022). However, since its IPO in mid-2021, Oatly has faced several challenges. Initially, the IPO was met with enthusiasm, with stock prices soaring to nearly $29. However, the company's share price has since experienced a significant decline, reflecting ongoing profitability challenges, concerns on market place , and unique voice challenging big dairy - pushed back hardly from 100+ years old industry. Oatly has been struggling to achieve profitability due to high operational and expansion costs, which have outpaced its revenue growth - which is also stressed by competition in the fields This has been compounded by manufacturing inefficiencies and the costs associated with scaling up production in new markets. Additionally, fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly oats, have impacted the cost of goods sold, further squeezing margins.

This not only cost a substantial erosion on share price but also put the company on 400M in debt ( ~820M revenue/year with 6-10% annual growth).

Not arguing all the struggles are over, but in my opinion , Oatly is in good way to get out of trouble and provide better outcomes in the future.

1. The new executive trio: 
Oatly’s recently appointed executive team is a powerhouse of industry expertise, crucial for steering the company’s strategic direction towards global leadership in the plant-based sector. This is very different that the prior management, having the philosophy of start-ups – prioritizing growth over profit in all occasions.

Based on their LinkedIn profiles :

“CEO Jean-Christophe Flatin has a storied career, having transformed global innovation and strategy at Mars Incorporated, a conglomerate known for its extensive portfolio in confectionery and pet care, before taking the helm at Oatly. His expertise in scaling operations and launching successful product lines directly informs Oatly's current strategies.

CFO Marie Jose David bringing experience from her time at Mars (where she worked together with JC) where she managed complex financial operations and strategic investments. Her financial acumen is complemented by a deep understanding of global markets gained from her prior roles at L'Oréal and Pandora, overseeing financial operations and driving profitability across international markets.

COO Daniel Ordonez previously led significant integration and operational efficiency initiatives at Danone, particularly within its dairy and plant-based divisions. His background in managing substantial market expansions and operational overhauls is vital as Oatly expands its production capabilities and market reach.”

The strategic priority of the company moved away from “growth at all costs” to “better before bigger”, and recent move to “better and bigger” with new management.

2. Strategic Partnerships and Market Expansion:
Oatly keep strategically partnering with high-profile global partners such as Starbucks, Luckin Coffee (with Limited time offering), KFC in china on soft ice cream and sorbet, Mc Donalds in Austria and Netherlands (for McCafee) and many more local and regional partners significantly enhancing its distribution network and consumer reach day by day. In addition, in recent quarterly presentation it was mentioned that there will be extended partnership with Walmart and Costco, which will mean significant revenue uplift.

Another high potential SKU they have is soft serve oat-ice cream currently served in KFC China and Carvel in US. Any potential to move to McDonald’s or similar fast food chain with global footprint for non-dairy ice cream or oat-shake’s will create another massive SKU other than its Barista edition oatmilk with coffeeshops. 

3. Business Dynamics and Supply Chain Optimization: Oatly's decision to streamline its operations, including the strategic closure of its Singapore manufacturing facility, reflects a focus on optimization and right sizing its supply chain. Singapore plant was a JV with YEO’s, inaugurated in 2021 for producing for AP including China. However in China, they opened a +3x capacity plant in Ma’Anshan and pulled volumes out of Singapore left the plant underutilized. 
In early 2024, Oatly announced divesture a part of their Ogden Plant in Utah USA to Ya Ya foods, well known for copacking operations in North America. (They claim they are the biggest partner of Tetrapak in NA), while Oatly will continue running the Oat base operations. Ya Ya foods completed the first expansion of their capacity in late summer. A recent interview with their CEO revealed that further hiring plans are in place.
“At the beginning, this expansion was projected to be 100 jobs in the near term. Right now, we’re at 150 jobs. By the end of this year (2024) we’ll add another 67. In the first six months of 2025, we should add another 100 jobs. I think this site will eventually reach 400 employees. “ 
In addition, they recently posted a hiring for “construction superintendent” , which is also proving that further expansion is on its way in Ogden facility.

4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analysis:
Eventhough still far from a world class profitable company, Oatly has demonstrated solid performance across several key metrics, indicating effective strategy execution of “significantly strong business before significantly big business”. 
* Revenue Growth: year-over-year increase to $208 million in Q3 2024.
* Gross Margin: Enhanced to 29.8%, reflecting improved product mix and operational efficiencies, Up from 2% 3 years back. 
* Volume Growth: 13% increase in product sales volume (YoY)
* Adjusted EBITDA: Shows reduced losses due to streamlined operations, down to $5 million with significant QoQ reduction.

5. Future Growth Potential
The global oat milk market is experiencing significant growth (even though growth seemed to be stalled in 2024) with projections suggesting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10+% and reaching a market size more than 5 billion USD by 2029. Especially in South east asia, combination of lactose intolerance is playing a big role on non-dairy alternatives with increasing coffee consumption can be significant catalyst for the industry & the company. 

6. Strategic Expansions and Partnerships in China:
China had been always the most significant opportunity but also most significant problem source until 2024 (including the Class action mentioning exaggerated success in China during IPO, settled 9.25MUSD in 2024).
However, turnaround in the region after “Asia reset” is becoming real. Flatin did not hesitate to bite the bullet to significantly reduce the SKUs sold there and absorb a temporary revenue hit of 40%. On the other hand, this efford also seems to be paying back that the region reported first adjusted EBITDA positive quarter in Q4 2024.
Recent interview of David Zhang was mentioning that company reached over 100,000 sales points (including 20000 Luckin coffee shops as LTO) and the market is entering to third wave where market consolidation happened and many companies are eliminated. 

7.North America : Revenue Potential in Costco and Walmart : Oatly announced extended partnerships with Costco and Walmart during Q3 2024 call. (These two companies are worlds biggest and biggest third retailers). Depending on extent of distribution (not yet disclosed), Oatly increasing its revenues by 10% (80M) in these outlets alone over the next two fiscal years will not be surprising. Also looking at the hiring postings of the company on LinkedIn, two recent openings (one to be filled already) is showing the imporance : Director of Mass and Retail Sales and VP for Club & Strategic Channel Growth. In addition , they recently hired and/or hiring similar business development positions if Benelux, Poland and Spain. 

8. A company with a mission : Recent interviews with new generations consumers have shown that the businesses which have a mission (other than making money) eventually will thrive. Oatly here has a unique voice that company do not hesitate to share especially on
Sustainability and Environmental Responsibility. They are advocating that CPG’s must add their carbon footprint on their packaging. 

The current share price reflects the current difficult financials. But looking at macroeconomic environment with reduced interest rates , and discipline shown by the company last two years, I believe there will be better days ahead for the share price.",3,1735875570.0,pennystocks,5,1.0,False

But I’m dumb and lots of decisions I’ve made put me in a shitty spot.

Overall I’m neglected and rejected by women. Or that’s how I feel. I think my experiences and looks and overall feeling invisible with simple interactions (like this one time I had an appointment and I told the receptionist I was there and then I waited and after an hour of standing in the corner I saw someone else take my turn and I walked up and asked what happened to my appointment and she clearly forgot my existance) my online dating experience was sooooo SHIT. 

So here’s the main reason I feel like this: I tried to do online dating for 5-7 years and in all that time I get one match every couple of months and then they disappear right away when I say hi, that means something right? Of course it does! I hear people getting so many matches and meeting so what’s wrong with me? Sorry I’m ugly I DIDN’T CHOOSE MY FACE AND WHATEVER ELSE PHYSICALLY UNAPPEALING!! I’m a nerd who likes anime and gaming and I’m not fat but I’m super scrawny so ok I get it that’s unappealing. And OK I DONT HAVE MUCH OF A SENSE OF HUMOR, and yea I’m not smart nor do I have stories to talk about. I get it I’m not an attractive male who gives that sense of protection for the woman and her babies but like… I have some of my shit together and i dont do drugs or alcohol so isnt that a step up SOMEWHERE?!

And I know I DID choose not to work out and I DID choose not to get fit and I DID choose to play video games daily and not learn any social skills. Well SOOOORRRYYYY I don’t smile and am sad looking all the FUCKING time because I had a shitty experience and felt rejected and gave up and was miserable. 

I get it… that’s on me. Those are ALL on me. I made my choices even though I had an opportunity to get better and grow I didn’t talk it and now I sit miserable and I want to get better but sometimes I feel like the universe doesn’t want me to. Little things happen every day that make it so that I’m being bullied into being weak. Like if I start working out, I get sick. So then I can’t work out, my gains are gone, and then I lose motivation… ugh I’m just making more and more excuses but it’s just these dumb little things. Like I’m trying to work out now and I have eaten in like 24 hours and I tried getting a sandwich and the stupid girl who had just clocked in to take over from the guy washed her hands (poorly) and then PROCEEDED TO DRY HER HANDS ON HER PANTS. I mean…… washing her hands has become a moot point now! FUCK WHY ARE PEOPLE SO STUPID THATS NOT HOW YOU WASH YOUR HANDS TO HANDLE FOOD! I could have said something though and chose not to and then threw that sandwich in the trash after paying for it. 

Man I’m pathetic. It’s me. I know. And ok yes I’m ugly this is true but I could work out. I could read books. I could join some sports club. I could sit in a coffee shop and not hide in my room with my video games. I could push through every single little thing or sickness and try and try to get stronger. I could do more…….. I want to do more. I’m so tired of being single and sad :(

I have pretty much kept it to myself, for fear of how crazy it sounds, and am just realizing it may have been exactly or near-exactly 20 years ago. 
Around New Years Day 2005 I was home from grad school on break. Mid-Atlantic US, house partway up a mountain. Every morning when my alarm clock went off, playing a local radio station, the sun would be peeking over the mountains directly in front of me through French doors. It was a nice way to wake up, beautiful view. 
On one particular morning the radio played much longer than usual, because it was completely dark in that walk-out basement. I kept hitting snooze. I finally woke up enough to get up and realize I would be late for work. I grabbed for my things in the dark and ran off to the shower. When I emerged it was still dark. 
The radio was also again playing, as a backup alarm. While rushing around I only subconsciously heard the DJs taking a phone call. A woman saying she was concerned because the sun wasn’t up. She always drove the same route to work at the same time, and the sun that should be in her eyes was not there. It was not raining or cloudy—it was fully pitch black still. I remember thinking vaguely, that’s right, this is weird. But I was in too big of a hurry to fully process, and I missed the rest of the conversation when I went to fix coffee and breakfast. 
I regretted it later in the car, when the sun was finally up a bit and I began to replay the situation in my head. Was that a joke? What else were they saying? Surely they had an explanation, I thought.

Later that day I had lunch with a coworker and quietly told my story. He seemed skeptical but also took it seriously. He suggested that he had heard something about the Indonesian tsunami being such a powerful disruption of the ocean that it could’ve knocked the earth off its axis, slightly and temporarily. This has always been a plausible (but scary) explanation to me. 
BUT in all the years since I’ve never been able to find a single reference to such a thing. Surely if I noticed and a radio caller noticed…there would be massive documentation of this. I would imagine widespread panic. But I can find nothing. It’s like it never happened. 
Perhaps I was simply out of the loop and many of you already know the publicized reason; I would be pleased to find out. But all my internet searches have always gone nowhere…so it has felt like something I must’ve dreamed up. But I know it wasn’t.",8,1735875380.0,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,1,1.0,False

Within the first 4 months everything was dreamy, I assumed it was exclusive but it was still casual. Anyway, in August I found out through mutual friends that he was infact back on tinder and seeing another girl who I actually knew. I confronted him about it just to gain some clarity on the situation but received the normal wish washy answer, but he did confirm he was supposedly only seeing us 2. End of September comes along and I see a post on social media of him with a DIFFERENT girl at a dj gig, but I choose to keep my mouth shut and we continue our normal casual seeing. Keep in mind he is first on my best friends list and talking to me everyday asking me a lot of random questions specifically about where I am and who I’m with (I don’t bother asking him that because it later clears out that he lied about his whereabouts anyway). So October and November pass and I continue seeing him, the usual. Fast forward to December and I find another two pictures of him at gigs with the SAME other girl (he even had the audacity to ask me for a ride to one of them??!!) However I know for a fact he is also seeing the mutal and myself at the same time. 1 week out from Xmas we chat over coffee and I bring up ‘other girls’ he admits to one but denies others, even though I’ve seen photo evidence and my mutal has suggested that she knows there is more than us 2. A couple days after Xmas he sends me a text out of the blue suggesting we stop things because he feels guilty for leading me on and feelings are ‘all over the place’ fair enough I guess. Anyway, he leaves for a festival over new years and he warned me that he would have no reception blah blah. Festival is over now and I’ve been completely ghosted and he’s dropped off the face of the earth, something he promised he’d never do. Photos come out from the festival and the SAME OTHER GIRL is in them. By now I’d done stalking and finally found her Instagram page only to find photos with him at her ball as a date (which he specifically told me was his friend’s in the moment), his dogs, soft launch type photos of them hiking and A PHOTO OF THEM KISSING?!?!? I genuinely don’t know what to think?? The kissing photo is at the festival but the other pics date back to October/November when he was still seeing me and another girl and potentially more. 
Only people who are dating each other post this right??? Also, her feed is all about him and he comments on most but he has absolutely nothing with her in it. It makes me think that he doesn’t want to post because all his other side pieces will go insane. 
Please can someone with experience or similar share their opinions? Do I reach out, do I keep playing the game, do I ask the mutual, do I text her?? ",1,1735875268.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

Story 4: The Negotiation

The war over a moon, designated L8-45, in Sector 12a was as inevitable as a nova collapsing into a black hole. Both the Novari Empire and humanity claimed it was essential. For us, it was simple—a mineral-rich satellite capable of powering our energy grid for centuries. For them? Who knows. They muttered something about “strategic significance” and “long-term interests,” but I always suspected their real motive was that they couldn’t bear to let us have it.

The war dragged on for years. Their ships were clunky but effective, a perfect reflection of their approach to conflict. Where we prized precision and elegance, humans treated battle like some deranged art form. They pulled off maneuvers that defied logic, flinging themselves into situations that should have ended in disaster—and somehow coming out ahead.

When both sides were finally too exhausted to continue, we agreed to negotiate. The venue was an ancient station floating in neutral space, steeped in the weight of countless past treaties. My delegation arrived with dignity: immaculate robes, datapads loaded with proposals painstakingly prepared over months.

The humans? They showed up late. Naturally. They barged into the chamber with their usual mix of casual arrogance and chaotic energy, carrying stacks of paper. Actual paper. Ink-smudged, dog-eared, towering stacks that looked ready to collapse.

“We’re here to negotiate peace,” their lead negotiator announced, slamming the paper down on the table with a grin so smug it should’ve been classified as a weapon. “This is the agreement we’ve drafted. Simple stuff.”

Simple? The first document alone was over 700 pages long. It included mineral extraction quotas, zoning laws, rules about lunar colony signage, and even a section specifying the proper coffee-to-tea ratio for delegation meetings.

We were too stunned to speak at first. Eventually, I managed to choke out, “We’ll review your proposal.” And so, we did. We countered their absurdity with absurdity of our own, drafting amendments for every clause, stipulations for every demand.

The negotiations quickly devolved into a war of paperwork. The chamber became a battlefield, with towering piles of documents on either side of the table. By the second week, the air reeked of human coffee—a vile substance that somehow fueled their negotiators while driving us mad.

Humans, as it turned out, thrived in chaos. They churned out new clauses and revisions like it was a game they were born to win. Their lead negotiator laughed at every objection, clearly enjoying himself. His team scribbled notes and drafted forms with an energy that should have been impossible after so many sleepless nights.

We tried to keep up, but their sheer output was overwhelming. They created regulations for things we’d never even considered: lunar noise ordinances, unnecessary SCUBA training for mining crews (I still have no idea why, as the moon had no water of its own), and protocols for something called ""interspecies karaoke nights."" Months passed, and the negotiation room became a tomb of paper, its walls completely hidden behind stacks of documents.

By the time we signed the so-called ""Novari Peace Accords,"" we were too exhausted to care what we’d actually agreed to. The terms were so convoluted no one could possibly enforce them. The moon was to be governed jointly, but the details were buried in thousands of pages no one would ever read.

The humans, of course, celebrated. Their lead negotiator raised a glass of something they called “whiskey,” laughing as though this entire ordeal had been a victory lap. We left in silence, defeated—not by their weapons or their cunning, but by their unrelenting ability to turn bureaucracy into a weapon of mass destruction.

As I boarded our ship, I glanced back at the humans, their laughter echoing through the station’s corridors. That’s when it hit me. The true danger of humanity isn’t their unpredictability or their resilience. It’s their ability to take something as mundane as paperwork and turn it into a weapon.

They didn’t just beat us—they buried us under their absurd bureaucracy, one form at a time.",13,1735874705.0,HFY,4,0.94,False

Farmhouse Pumpkin & Spice was the perfect pumpkin spice candle, a non-gourmand that didn't fall into the trap of being overly sweet as many pumpkin candles do. (To my nose.) The patchouli is well balanced, bringing warmth and depth without being too heavy and earthy. I don't usually buy backups but was sure to get an extra for next year. Also, kudos to the graphic designer for this series. The jar is gorgeous (gourd-geous?) and looked lovely with my fall decor.

Autumn Drive was a rich berry/amber combo that brought me lots of compliments. However, every now and then I'd get a whiff of watermelon gum that felt out of season. (I like watermelon scents, but usually in summer.) Still, loved this one overall and would wear again as a summer to fall transition scent.

Fall in Bloom: Please, please, please bring this back, BBW. I'm begging you. This and Dahlia are my favorite rich, fruity florals.

Wrapped in Vanilla: Please, please, please bring this back, BBW. I'm begging you. I'm not much of a gourmand girl but I loved smelling like vanilla cake batter.

Rose: A classic. I have a bottle going at all times.


The Not-So-Good:

Marshmallow Pumpkin Latte shower gel smelled basically like nothing. A mildly musky vanilla scent, nothing to write home about. I ended up putting it in a soap dispenser to use as hand soap and used OGX Coconut Coffee body wash/scrub in the shower instead.

1hsctnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1hsctnw/feeling_so_frustrated_that_i_dont_have_a_friend/,"Feeling so frustrated that I don't have a friend group, and can't seem to get one no matter how hard I try. ","I would consider myself a fairly attractive guy - I'm 28 years old, over 6 ft tall, I work out, and I get 2-4 matches per day on dating apps. I'm also a friendly and have a good sense of humor. But I've never had a core friend group. I have individual friends who I'll catch up with 1 on 1, but I'm not a part of their friend groups, and I don't have a main friend group of my own. So they'll meet with me for drinks or a coffee from time to time, but they'll spend most of their social time with their own friend groups which I'm not a part of. For as far back as I can remember, I've craved the idea of having a group of 3 or 4 really good friends who I could regularly hang out with, go on trips and make memories with, and who would have my back just like I'd have theirs. I'm an only child so I don't even have any siblings to hang out with, which makes me crave a friend group even more. It seems like such a normal thing that most people take for granted. But the older I get, the more I realize that I might never get to experience this.

I'm an extremely loyal person by nature. I go out of my way to help people, even if they don't ask for it. But they never do the same for me. For example, one of my so-called friends recently asked me if I could give him some tips for an upcoming job interview, since I have pretty good interview skills. I took time out of my day to get on a call with him and spent almost 3 hours walking him through interview techniques and giving him various tips that helped me land a job. The next day, after the interview was over, he didn't even bother texting me to let me know how it went. He wouldn't have even said anything if I hadn't followed up to ask. Situations like these just make me feel like my ""friends"" only reach out if they need something, yet they're never here for me in the same way when I need them.

I'm also always the one reaching out to initiate plans. If I don't reach out and ask to catch up, my friends almost never invite me to things or suggest that we hang out, because they have their own friends group that I'm not a part of. It makes me feel so invisible and unwanted, even though I know that I'm desirable because I have a pretty active dating life and have no trouble getting attention from women. But when it comes to friendships, for whatever reason I always feel like the kid who gets picked last in gym class, no matter what I do.

In 2024, I went out of my way to try to make new friends and be adopted by a friend group. I went to a bunch of social events where I didn't know anyone just to try and make new friends. I did meet some new people who invited me to hang out with them, but they were all part of a group who'd known each other for 10+ years and were BFFs, and I felt like the odd one out. I did join a couple of their hangouts, but I always felt like an outsider. They had their own group chat which I wasn't a part of (understandable because they'd known each other since freshman year of college), and even though I tried to keep the friendship going, eventually we just faded out of contact. And when I texted one of them again after a while of not seeing each other, I was ghosted and left on delivered.

I know I'm a good person, and I always go the extra mile for my friends (or the people who I like to think are my friends). But I've never even so much as been invited to a new year's party before. Leading up to this New Year's all I wanted was to finally know what it was like to be included in something. To be invited to a new year's party and get to celebrate the new year with people who weren't my parents or relatives. But not a single person reached out to invite me to anything. I tried suggesting to my individual friends that we do something for new years when I saw them 1 on 1 in December, and they all said ""yeah sounds good!"" and then went on to plan their own parties with their own friend groups. And once again I was left out.

I'm going to be 30 in 2 years, and I've never experienced what it's like to have a best friend or a group of best friends. I'm just so sick and fed up of seeing everyone on social media posting all these pictures with their friend groups for new years, and meanwhile I didn't even have a single person to celebrate it with. I don't understand why everyone around me seems to have a core group of friends, and even multiple groups of friends, and yet no matter how hard I try, I can't get one of my own. I just want to feel like I belong, but I'm starting to lose hope that I'll find a friend group, and that I'll just have to be content with feeling alone for the rest of my life.",2,1735874446.0,lonely,2,1.0,False

F 25 located in CST (9:00 PM) looking to find a couple more partners to fill missing desires! (Read if you’re seeing this you’re not being replaced!) obligatory disclaimers: I write in first person, I don’t like people who control my character, I like story movement and don’t want to be the only one pushing. 

Please be 23+, within 6 hours of CST, capable of 4+ decently written paragraphs, friendly, and have a common interest in at minimum romance + 1 other interest.

Ideas: 
Fantasy race fated/chosen mates. Whether it’s two of the same or two different races, our characters must overcome the cultural differences and personal baggage to have a happy and prosperous relationship. 
Desired tropes: stuck together, grumpy/sunshine, unique pairing

Fantasy enemies to lovers. Similar to the above, our characters have been thrust into unfortunate circumstances and are forced to tolerate the other until their task (adventure, political, marriage?) is accomplished.  Will they still dislike each other? Or will they be madly in love with each other by the end?
Desired tropes: Stuck together, enemies to lovers, unique pairing

Vampire hunter and his target. A local woman is accused of stirring up all kinds of trouble when several bodies turn up drained of blood.  The man tasked with investigating and hunting her down has to reevaluate his life choices when he learns who the woman is. 
Desired tropes: Second chance romance

Accidental demon summon. It was initially an accident that she summoned the demon, something about a mispronunciation.  Just as the demon is about to leave, intruders show up and he feels obligated to stick around… you know at least until she is safe. 
Desired tropes: grumpy sunshine, love at first sight 

Open to your suggestions! I’m always down for pretty much anything fantasy related! 

I’m most interested in finding someone that I can chat with ‘out of character’ just as easily as I can send a roleplay reply to. One of the more important deciding factors of my partners for me is how I click with them on a personal level. I like to be friendly, chat about nonsense and have fun with each other.  I’m frequently described as quirky, sensitive, kind, thoughtful, playful, and a bit of a hippie.  Writing recently has been kind of hard, but I’m slowly finding my motivation again! A passionate partner makes for a great motivator.

It’s been almost a year 

She got upset we had our disagreement and she quit talking to me. There have been moments we reconnected for a bit but it’s never been the same. There have been glimpses of hope she wants to be friends again

She has at least one other good friend now. Because of the timing it kind of hurts sometimes because it was around the time we stopped talking so I feel she replaced me. But that’s silly and unhelpful for me to think though I do sometimes feel jealous because they are close and she says she loves her. In a way it gives me hope she can or will love me as I know I am just as kind and just as loving and can be a good friend just like her if given a chance, and I have my own unique personality and benefit only I can provide. I feel a year is plenty of time and space to forgive me. I apologized and expressed how I feel and how much she and our friendship means to me. I’ve tried to see things from her perspective. I’ve given her compliments and in the past small gifts. I offered to treat her for her birthday when things were good. More recently I have brought up things people and pictures that helped us connect and remember the past. I have given her my contact info just in case and suggested we hang out or get together perhaps for coffee when she is ready. I’ve told her little life updates about my day and asked about hers. I’ve encouraged her professional life and done my best to stay out of her personal life though I haven’t been perfect as it Ms been an area of dissent. I’ve complimented her about her internal and external beauty. I’ve told her I will always be there for her and love her unconditional and that there is no pressure for when/if she wants to talk. 

All of this with little in return. At one point in the beginning she had blocked me so idk if I’m blocked now but she has responded since then so my guess is no. A year is a long time and while things may not ever be the same I thought we would be further along in our friendship by now. Maybe she’s not ready? Maybe she doesn’t want to be friends again after all and changed her mind. Should I ask her? Is a year too long to wait? ",0,1735874175.0,NoStupidQuestions,1,0.5,False

1hscpcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patagonia/comments/1hscpcn/w_trek_east_to_west_dec_2024_trip_report/,W Trek East to West - Dec 2024 Trip Report,"Hellooo wanted to share a trip report on my experience doing the W trek East to West solo in mid December 2024. Apologies this will be pretty long since I wanted to include details I had questions for before and after the W trek as well. I probably could have organized it bit better but just went with daily diary style recap. 

**Bit about myself:** 30F with lots of solo day hiking experience where I typically like to carry 10L pack - longest day hike completed was \~31km. This was my first multi-day trek. The last time I did some real hiking before this trip was in October, but otherwise did not really train for anything specific. Going into the trip I was most worried about hiking with my heavier pack that I'm not accustomed to + staying in refugios (I typically prefer to stay in private room accommodations. 

**My bookings:** I booked the classic W through Las Torres in August which is an all inclusive package. It was expensive yes, but at the time I couldn't find any availability through Torreshike. I chose refugio option and they booked me at Central for 2 nights, Frances, and Paine Grande. They also booked all of my bus, catamaran, and park tickets. It was a bit of back and forth via email but they do have a whatsapp number you can contact that was pretty responsive. 

**My pack**: I bought a Deuter Futura Pro 34 SL for this trip. It fit everything I needed to bring and was very comfortable. I forgot to weigh the final pack including water but I think it was just under 10kg. This + my uniqlo slingbag were the only pieces of luggage I brought with me because I wanted to avoid checking a bag at all cost. I did not bring or use hiking poles.

**Key apps used:**

* Alltrails - downloaded offline map for W trek and used it for navigation and tracking. I only needed navigation more for the sunrise hike to Base Las Torres since sometimes I couldn't differentiate the main trail in the dark. 
   * Instead of downloading the map for the whole W trek, I'd suggest downloading the individual sections as well. This will be more useful for checking where you are on the hike and how much left is to go since you're able to see the zoomed in version of the trail details including elevation profile. 
   * You don't need to pause tracking in between days at the risk of losing the tracked sections. There's a manual way to combine each leg of the W when you get home - google 'alltrails combining multiple activities into one'
* Windy app - registered for a 7 day free trial after reaching Puerto Natales. The forecasts for the viewpoint locations were pretty accurate overall but don't use it to determine rain/wind/clouds b/c that's impossible. Look at the UV index instead on an hourly basis. The higher the UVI means the better shot you have at a clear view at a certain time despite the main forecast showing as cloudy or rainy. 
   * Within TDP, you can as refugios to show you the windguru forecast and use this same approach. 

**Key takeaways:** I went specifically to do W trek only as I kind of booked it on an impulse but in hindsight I should've planned to add in other parts of Chile/Argentina since the journey to this part of the world was LONG. 

* The weather is impossible to forecast correctly 100% As mentioned above, check for the UVI as an indicator for whether the forecasted clouds may clear up at a certain time. Even if you ask the refugios, they will err on side of caution and reiterate the main weather forecast. However imo, if you've come so far to do this hike, unless there's downpour rain or something extreme forecasted, just come prepared for all kinds of weather and shoot your shot on each hike. At best you luck out, at worst, you have a nice story to tell and more reasons to get a drink after. Trust your gut though and don't do anything dangerous. 
* The WIND is as crazy as everyone says. Think about how much tissue you need for blowing your nose and then 10x that amount. I filled an entire pocket with used tissue for my Frances to Paine Grande hike and my nose felt raw lol. 
* The water from refugios in TDP tasted normal to me (cold and hot) - not at all bad like some previous reviews. I found the water in Chile to be overall very hard due to the minerals so it can be very drying. Bring a small thing of vaseline with you which is multipurpose.
* If you are self booking and are debating on whether to book the meals at refugios - dinner at Las Torres refugios are good and pretty healthy although portion is standard size for everyone. I would pass on breakfast and lunch. Absolutely do not book any meals at Paine Grande. If you run out of food, refugios have small marts that sell junk food snacks and Paine Grande pizza is decent enough for the cost. 
* Goretex rain jacket is a must, rain pants optional imo, but then again I lucked out and did not have any strong rainfall. Hat (winter) and packable down jacket also a must even for summer months. Trail runners with good traction worked well for me especially for the summer months. Hiking poles are a nice to have imo but I was fine without them. Rest of your clothing are up to your personal preferences. 
* It doesn't matter which direction you do the hike. In general I preferred the views east of Frances so I would do East to West again because I'd rather be fresh and ready to hike for what I think is the better side of the W.  
* Unless you're paying for lots of laundry service or .. I don't even know other examples, you absolutely do not need to carry cash. Most places even took AMEX. I brought 30USD with me as backup lol and ended up only using 10USD, partially for laundry service and used the rest for tip. 
* Would recommend bringing a few packs of emergen-c or something. I got really sick after the trip, likely from the lack of sleep.
* Even if you're an introverted solo traveller like me, just open up to meeting and chatting with new people. You choose who you get to be while travelling and it'll make your experience more enjoyable.
* ENJOY the journey because time just flies by

**My really long trip Itinerary + daily diary notes:** 

* **Day 0**: Flew Delta from Canada to Santiago with a long layover in Atlanta. I had cc access to Delta Skyclubs to pass the time which I recommend doing if it's a option for you. 
   * My pack's frame is slightly longer than the allowed carry on size and especially when fully packed, I don't think it would have fit Delta's sizer. Thankfully I was not asked to gate check my bag on either flights despite the multiple volunteer requests to gate check carry-ons. My boarding zone was in the middle though so that also helped. My bag fit vertically in the overhead on the ATL to Santiago plane (A350), but it had to go in slightly diagonally on the Canada to ATL plane (B737-800). 
* **Day 1**: Landed in Santiago in the early morning, found the Transvip counter to book a transfer to my hotel for 10,200 CLP. Very quick and easy to do although you may be able to save a dollar or something by booking online.
   * After paying at the counter, you exit the airport on the same level and look for people wearing orange vest. There are several Transvip vans waiting on standby and the coordinator person will direct you to go to a specific van based on space remaining. The vans do not leave until every seat is filled (although I assume there may be exceptions during slow periods). The driver had an app for GPS + prioritized the drop-offs.
   * I stayed at Hotel Capital Bellet in Providencia for one night - highly recommend as it was cheap, rooms were small but comfortable and clean and came with a kettle. Lobby had a water filter available for free as well. Freshened up in the lobby washroom then dropped off my pack as it was too early to check in. 
   * From the hotel it was a short walk to the park entrance to hike up to San Cristobal. Santiago was HOT and wearing my plane clothes (fleece sweats) was not a good time lol so I'd recommend packing a change of clothes that is easily accessible (or wear underneath). After the hike up I was in dire need of AC and iced coffee so I hurried down and went to the Costanera mall. The AC was in there was disappointing lol but I got iced oat latte from the shop outside of decathlon (forgot the name but its a japanese brand) and it glorious. Walked around the mall a bit before I headed back to the hotel. I'd been travelling and awake for more than 24 hours by this point and was exhausted so I needed some comfort food so ended up at a nearby korean restaurant called Koychi. It was just okay.
* **Day 2**: Flew with Sky airline from Santiago to Puerto Natales, with a very short layover in Puerto Montt. I booked the flight on their site 4 months before, chose to purchase seat, and was able to check in online. Note that once you purchase and select the seat, they did not let me change the seat after.
   * I used uber for my ride to the airport since it was early morning and I didn't want to bother with dealing with shared transfer. Costed 21,606 CLP. 
   * Santiago airport terminals is pretty intuitive - Terminal 1 = domestic flights, Terminal 2 = international. 
   * The Sky check-in line if you have bags to check in was kind of long, but otherwise security was fast. If you do not have bags to check, you can just use self serve kiosks (any of them, did not have to be the cluster in the Sky desk area) or check in online.
   * Security in Chile overall was super chill, no need to take out liquids or anything rly. 
   * I went to the 'Salones VIP Pacific Club' lounge ... the food was horrible. If you do not have free access to it, please save your money and just get food elsewhere. The seating options were nice but not worth it lol.
   * At the gate close to boarding time, people started to voluntarily size their own bags in the sizer?? I saw the gate agent print out a few luggage tags for a few of them after. Otherwise they did not force anyone to size their carry-on bags and did not enforce the carry-on + personal item rules since I saw several people bring >2 bags + huge carry ons lol. This was not a completely full flight though. Overhead bins were quite spacious on the A321neo planes. 
   * If you wish to get a chance to see TDP from the sky on the flight to PNT, sit on the left side of the plane. For the flight back to Santiago, sit on the right for the same. 
   * Flight was on time for departure and arrived early by 20 minutes. The stop in Puerto Montt was very short and efficient with people getting off and new people boarding. Overall would recommend. 
   * PNT airport was the smallest I've ever been to but surrounded by mountain views 😍 Once you exit baggage claim area which was just one carousel, you'll see counters for taxi + city bus transfer. City transfer was same concept as Transvip however its only 4,000 CLP. On the ticket they give you is a whatsapp number which you can use to book your transfer back to the airport. would recommend this if you're not in a rush. 
   * I stayed at an Airbnb called 'Kauyi Kren' - highly recommend again for the cheap studio apartments and perfect location, it's steps away from the boardwalk along the water + many great dining options and you have the option to cook your own meals as well. 
   * Dropped off my stuff, got coffee, walked along the water a bit and then walked to Unimarc to buy some groceries. The produce options was quite limited but you can make do. 
* **Day 3**: Full day in Puerto Natales. Very small town with like 16-17 hours of daylight in Dec which is crazy to me haha. In hindsight I would have opted to skip this full day and head to TDP however I wanted to add buffer for any potential travel delays. 
   * There really is not much to do other than walking/running/biking along the water, trying out coffee shops/restaurants, stocking up on snacks and other essentials for your trek if needed and adjust for any jetlag. I opted to save money here by cooking my meals but I did get coffee from Holaste which was pretty good. Also DO buy a bottle of chilean wine from the grocery store and enjoy it :)
   * There are so many stray dogs in town which always makes me sad.
   * I used a laundry service ""Lavanderia Catch"" to wash my plane clothes so it's clean and fresh for after my trek. The lady takes cash only and mandates a minimum 2kg so if you don't have that much clothes you just pay for the extra ... it is what it is. I did not take out any cash and did not plan to use cash elsewhere and all the bank ATMs had high withdrawal fee. The lady did let you pay in USD but the exchange rate she used was not great. I ended up finding a currency exchange place located in the guy's own house it seemed who was able to exchange 10USD at a much better rate which was nice. 
* **Day 4 / W Trek Day 1**: I was scheduled to take the Base Torres bus to TDP from the bus station at 2:15pm. 
   * In the morning, I repacked my bag with only the essential items for W trek. Took out some extra stuff and packed it in a small tote bag. I brought this to the hotel I opted to stay out post-trek and was able to store it there for the next 5 days. Otherwise leaving it at the airbnb was also an option. 
   * After checking out I walked to Alveoli Bakery to have lunch before walking to the bus station. Lunch was decent, the heated patio space was nice and it was located close to the bus station. 
   * The bus terminal was really small with a free washroom, few vendors selling water, snacks etc and some sort of cafeteria upstairs with one main vendor. Because I booked with Las Torres, I had to wait for one of their reps to arrive. When the Las Torres person arrived, she checked everyone in and handed out the welcome kits which included a cheap ish stainless steel water bottle (did not retain heat well), sleeping bag liner, microfiber towel, and paper map which were all contained in a drybag. You also get a leather bracelet thing which serves as a wristband of sorts to get you access to free tea/coffee and stuff within the refugios.
   * Boarded the bus which was not full and soon we were on our way! The bus tickets had assigned seat numbers however most people didn't even realize + was not checked or enforced esp since it wasn't full. The bus ride was 2 hours and make sure to sit on the left side for views of TDP along the way! It was a clear afternoon and it was soooo majestic in the distance. 
   * Once we reached the park entrance welcome centre, we got off the bus to wait for the next one to take us to Central. The wait was longer than expected so take your time taking some pics, stretch your legs out. Be prepared for wind and dust in your face lol. Start chatting up the rest of people from your bus because you'll likely all have the same itinerary and see each other throughout the next 5 days. Plus it's nice to secure some familiar faces for dinner :) 
   * When we finally arrived at Central welcome centre (where the gift shop is), people staying at the refugio vs camping had to go to different areas for check-in. 
   * Check-in at Central refugio was a bit slow overall. They'll ask you for your passport, PDI slip (remember to bring it), choose a dinner time (7 or 8:15pm), choose a breakfast time (i think 7 and 8am were the options) then hand you your meal + welcome drink ticket. If you plan to do sunrise hike to Base Las Torres, you can request them to put out your breakfast and lunchbox for midnight. After all that's done, they'll walk you to your room and show you the washroom and your bed for your stay. Each room has 6 beds.
   * My room was full for the first night, but my bottom bunk was empty for the second night. I had the top bunk which is super not recommended imo because the ladder was so hard to use lol I thought for sure I'd slip getting down. There is no outlet in the dorms but there is a lounge area with plenty of outlets available. You can sit there and wait or just leave your items there. The beds came with pillow with pillowcase and sleeping bag and you're meant to use a sleeping bag liner. I used my own silk liner which comes with a pillow cover too. 
   * The refugio washrooms were pretty clean overall. 3 toilet stalls, 2 fully walled shower stalls with doors and a small dry area for changing, 2 sinks. The sink faucets were super foreign to me and awkward to use and not very sanitary by design.... Hard to explain but you'll figure it out by watching someone else haha. 
   * Dinner at Central is served in 3 courses, very fast and efficiently. Over the 2 nights I stayed here they were both a veggie soup with bread (1 pc per person), meat with some sort of carb mash and shared salad veggies for the table, and dessert. Multiple people asked me about dietary restrictions so seems like they pay close attention to that. I didn't pay attention to what the vegan/veg options were. They have a decent bar too which you can pay for by card. Probably why they give you a free welcome drink so it gets the ball rolling lol. 
   * The sleep quality at central was horrible lol, walls were paper thin, you can hear next room's snoring, talking, the noise from the washrooms echoed as well. I got maybe an hour of decent sleep on the first night before it was time to wakeup for sunrise hike. 
* **Day 5 / W Trek Day 2**: Sunrise hike to Mirador Base Las Torres - got up at midnight, got ready and tried to pack my stuff as quietly as possible, went to the dining area and saw my name on a brown paper lunch bag + breakfast. There were multiple other breakfasts + lunches set out for other people.
   * Breakfast was 2 hard boiled eggs, deli meat and cheese slices, basic white bread, butter, cereals, milk, instant coffee and teas. Hot water and cold water were always available. 
   * Lunch included a simple chicken sandwhich containing a slice of tomato, i think cheese, and mayo, protein bar, a green apple, trail mix, chocolate bar. 
   * I took 1.5L of water with me but that turned out to be unnecessary since you could refill at Chileno refugio too. 1L would have been enough. 
   * I was able to meet several other people planning to hike for sunrise so don't worry if you're a solo traveller and worried about hiking in the dark. You can be sure to find people. 
   * The hike up took less time than expected \~ 2.5 hours to Chileno, and another 1 hr from Chileno to the top. The weather changed A LOT so dress and pack appropriately - started with no wind, then some drizzle, then near the top it became a small blizzard. It was below 0 at the top while waiting for sunrise + strong winds. I wore a tshirt, long sleeve sun hoody, added a down jacket layer at the top, rain jacket, leggings, hiking pants, wool hiking socks, trail runners, and a beanie. Did not bring gloves but that would've been nice. 
   * The towers were so majestic behind the turquoise blue lake. Although sunrise was cloudy, it did clear up due to the strong winds. Absolutely breathtaking. 
   * After taking pictures, I left my small group to start hiking down because I was freezing lol. The winds got stronger and stronger and there's an open boulder section near the top. Be careful there and if your balance is not that great just stay still during a wind gust - better to be sure footed than get tipped over by the wind.
   * The hike down was just as breathtaking and I took sooooo many pics on the way down. This was overall my favourite hike throughout the trip bc of the diversity of views you get.
   * By the time we reached the bottom, the winds REALLY picked up and I couldn't walk forward during some of the gusts. I heard that later in the day the park rangers closed the last 1.5km section of the trail to the top due to the strong winds so tons of people that started later in the morning had to turn back.
   * Would highly recommend doing this as a sunrise hike if not for the calmer trail alone - saw tons of people going up on the way down. 
   * Arrived back at Central at noon and all the dorm sections were closed for cleaning. Wasn't allowed to go into the rooms or use the showers until around 1:30PM so I chilled in the dining area and got an aperol spritz lol. Was a bit too sweet for my liking but hit the spot. 
   * The shower actually felt sooo nice, great pressure and temp control. I was starting to get really hungry afterwards and still had hours until dinner so I tried to get a nap in. Also wanted to hold off from buying wifi for as long as possible ... but eventually I caved and purchased an hour lol. I forget all the pricing but the cheapest option was 1 hour for 9,990 CLP, and there was 3 hours for 13,990 CLP. Easiest option was to purchase from a machine which gives you a code to use. Seemed like you could share this with multiple people within the time limit. Speeds were pretty good but you have to stay in that dining hall/charging area for the best signal. 
   * Dinner was a happy time again esp with more wine, although the portions seemed small especially when someone like me (5'3) gets the same amount as like > 6ft men and I felt like the amount was just right for me. 
   * Sleep again was bad for me personally and the room was also way to warm. 
* **Day 6 / W Trek Day 3**: Hike from Central to Refugio Frances - This and the hike to Mirador Britanico are tied for my 2nd fave. 
   * This was my rest day of sorts since it's a shorter hiking day so I decided to take more time in the morning although I ended up wanting to leave immediately after breakfast after I saw how many people were checking out. 
   * Got the 7am breakfast slot and it was hot scrambled eggs (portion was tiny per person), and same continental spread - toast, butter & jams, deli meat and cheese slices, cereals, brewed coffee, tea bags. Lunch was identical to day before. 
   * I left around 7:45am and most of the trail going west was very quiet for me which I enjoy. The strong winds were starting to die down and the sun was out with some higher clouds. Once I got over the first elevation section and saw the first glimpse of Lago Nordenskjöld it was just WOW. The turquoise blue was so freaking beautiful and the more west you go, the larger the lake comes into view and wow. I was so happy the entire time lol it's truly so so beautiful and none of the pictures do it justice. The overall hike to Frances was pretty easy with a few up and down sections. It got rainier towards Frances but nothing too major. 
   * One thing to note - several parts of the trail were super narrow and also flooded. There were also several stream crossings. I still managed to stay dry in trail runners and no hiking poles. 
   * Arrived at Frances area just after 2pm and the campsites and refugio section were quite spread out which made it kind of confusing. The refugio domes and dining hall were actually way down the hill. Check-in process was same as Central except they no longer required passport or PDI here. Dinner times were same as well and I was able to request for breakfast/lunch to be ready earlier again (opted for 5am). 
   * Fortunately I was able to select the bed I wanted as I was the first in my dorm to check in. The refugio here is actually in individual dome style huts, each equipped with 8 beds, 2 shower stalls with doors, 2 toilet stalls, and 1 sink. It was the nicest refugio I stayed in over the 4 nights - felt really cozy, just warm enough, and was fortunate to have an all female dorm this time. Each bed also has an outlet which was great. 
   * Frances and Central are both run by Las Torres so dinner was same structure and breakfast was basically the same. Lunch sandwhich was horrible tho lol. 
   * If you are doing premium camping at Frances, just beware that the tent platforms are really spread out and you could get assigned one that's far from the washroom. Also if you paid for dinner, it's kind of a trek to the dining hall especially if you wanted to wear slippers lol. 
   * Sleep was okay here, way better than Central for sure but I'm just not a great sleeper in new places so I got maybe 4 hours of decent sleep. 
* **Day 7 / W Trek Day 4**: Day hike up to Mirador Britanico and then hike to Paine Grande. 
   * Ate breakfast around 5am along with many several other people. Packed everything up and then started the hike to the Italiano ranger station. They weren't open yet but there's maybe 3 large shelving units on the outside of the ranger station (you'll see it immediately as you walk towards it) to leave your pack there. Felt a bit sketchy since my bag was the first one there but it was all fine. 
   * The hike to Britanico was much easier than I expected, maybe b/c I only carried my sling bag and water but the trail wasn't too long and elevation wasn't super grueling. Much easier than the base las torres hike imo. 
   * It was windy and cloudy most of the way up but have faith and wait a bit. The view at Britanico cleared up 90% - only parts of the left side of the panoramic view was hidden rest of the panorma was SO majestic. The viewpoint area was smaller than I thought so get there early.
   * Mirador Frances was also beautiful once the clouds cleared - you're still able to see the same mountains from Mirador Britanico so your call whether you want to hike all the way up. IMO it was worth it esp if you don't have the heavy pack with you. 
   * When I got back to the ranger station, all the shelving units were jam packed with everyone's packs so several packs were left on the ground instead. I still wonder how much all that equipment was worth lol. 
   * I tried to use the washroom but it was DISGUSTING. There was only one ""working"" stall and the toilet did not flush and was like 80% full... with all sorts of stuff floating around. Saw it and was like NOPE not worth the risk for that gross backsplash of the toilet water ... I got my stuff and started booking it to Paine Grande. 
   * The trail will be heavily trafficked at this time sooo it'll be tricky to find places to relieve yourself so just keep that in mind. Thankfully the hike is pretty easy. Once you pass the Lago Skottsberg area into the last section that's more open, the winds get REALLY strong. I felt like I was just constantly slammed by wind lol. 
   * I reached Paine Grande by like 2:45pm and check in was super slow here .. same process as previous places though except dinner times here were 6/7/8pm buffet style, and breakfast was an open 6-9am slot also buffet style. 
   * The beds here were fancier with clean fitted sheets which was nice. I still used my liner but you didn't need it. Each room came with 6 beds, and 6 mini lockers which was nice. there were only a few hooks and limited outlet in the room.
   * The washrooms were larger overall but farther away and shared by more people. Showers were so weird.... and felt so exposed. I didn't bother using it since it was the last night anyways. 
   * Now for the food. It was the worst of all the refugios I stayed at. For dinner they had rice, basic mashed potatoes, pasta with some basic red sauce, roast chicken and beef. SOUNDS okay but the chicken and beef were SO dry. The chicken literally looked like a stale dinner roll on my plate ... If you did not purchase a package and were thinking of buying meals separately, SKIP paine grande. Their other a la carte options though like the pizza were cheaper than the dinner meal cost and tasted better. 
   * After dinner, a group of us went upstairs to the bar area which was quite lively. Everyone was more or less celebrating the last night and drinks were flowing. 
   * The drinks helped with the initial sleep ... but I woke up from the snoring around 3am lol. Here's another kicker. Paine Grande shuts off the power at night until a bit after 5am in the morning. So I used my phone light to find my way to the washroom in the dark lol. 
* **Day 8 / W Trek Day 5:** Hike to Grey Glaciar viewpoint and back, 6:30PM ferry. 
   * Breakfast starts at 6am and it was a slooooowww line to get moving in the morning. I was expecting a decent breakfast after the dismal dinner because it's literally the easiest meal to make imo. I was wrong - breakfast was another 10x worse lol. They served ""scrambled eggs"" as protein but that was not it. The texture was gross - wet, mushy, almost slightly jelly like???, tasted almost sulfur-ish, I was genuinely concerned I'd get food poisoning while hiking. I had 2 pieces of toast with butter/jam only + coffee. 
   * The lunch was not it either ... thankfully I opened it up to check before I carried that extra weight with me. The sandwhich was exploding with mayo and I couldn't see anything else. 
   * Paine Grande is overall the largest refugio with nice seating options and a great view but if it weren't for the location, I would not recommend staying here. 
   * For the hike to Grey Glaciar, you can leave your bag at Paine Grande but I think you had to pay. My pack wasn't too heavy and I figured this would be my last opp to train with it for a while so I just decided to hike with it.
   * The hike to the first viewpoint was pretty quick and painless. The viewpoint is kind of on a wide exposed ledge next to lago grey and it was SO SO windy that I could barely stand still enough to take pictures.
   * The rest of the hike to refugio grey and the glaciar viewpoint felt long, was windy, rocky, and maybe because this was my last day and I was tired, it just did not feel super enjoyable. The glaciar viewpoint was nice and seeing the glaciar closer was cool and all but just didn't feel super worth it to me. My main motivations by this point were 1) the fact that the hiking gods blessed me with great weather so I should be grateful and just finish this, 2) I needed to complete the W because that's what I went there to do, and 3) my ferry is not until 6:30pm so what else would I do with the time. On the way back to Paine Grande, the sun was fully up and more of the clouds cleared away so Lago Grey and the surrounding snow capped mountains were mesmerizing. The hike overall was beautiful and worth it in hindsight and I'm glad I pushed myself to complete it. 
   * Got back to Paine Grande around 3pm, ordered a pizza combo which instead of 2 beers, I negotiated for 2 glasses of wine instead and the server graciously agreed haha. The pizza was a bit undercooked but served its purpose. Then people gathered in the bar again and I got a ramazzotti spritz which is similar to aperol but better. It was served in a giant goblet style glass that inspired 3 others in my group to order one too haha VERY good value. 
   * Went to the dock to start lining up for the catamaran at around 6pm and the line quickly grew. Catamaran showed up right at 6:30 and took some time to board. They did scan everyone's tickets so come prepared. If you want to take pictures and stuff sit on the top. Otherwise just go inside on the bottom. 
   * After the catamaran, you walk a bit to the buses to go back to Puerto Natales. This time the bus was full. I basically passed out as soon as the bus set off and woke up to see we had arrived already right around 10pm so \~ 3 hours. Immediately ordered an uber to go to Hotel Costanera which came pretty quickly. 
   * Hotel Costanera check in was so fast, she asked me what time I wanted to eat breakfast and said my stored bag is already in my room. The room was a beautiful sight after this trek and immediately showered and had the best sleep. Breakfast was simple but glorious as well. Freshly made to order eggs + continental spread. Amazing value for the hotel and the staff were all SO kind and accommodating. My favourite stay of the entire trip. 
* **Day 9 + rest of the trip**: Fly back to Santiago, stay a night near airport, fly out next morning back to Canada with layover in Atlanta. 
   * Flew Sky and Delta on the way back as well, same experience overall regarding carry-ons. 
   * PNT airport is so tiny and security is so chill that you can show up 30 mins before boarding time and it'd be fine. I chose to be on the safe side and showed up 1 hr before boarding time. 
   * Stayed overnight near Santiago airport since I arrived at 8pm and flew out next morning. Hotel was La Quinta by Wyndham Santiago ... it was meh just a cheap ish option in that area. 
   * Santiago Terminal 2 has a Skyteam lounge which you can only access if 1) you have access to the lounge AND 2) if you have a boarding pass for a skyteam airline such as Delta. Note that LATAM flights will not qualify. Because of this the lounge was pretty quiet. Food was okay and had bottled mineral water which was nice. 
   * Security was again very chill and fast at Santiago airport. 
   * HOWEVER!!!! If you are flying to the US there is apparently a separate ""TSA"" checkpoint DURING BOARDING literally on the jetway to the plane. This means they will make you pour out all of your water for a 10 hour flight .... I have never seen this before and it felt so ridiculous because they make you open up your bag for MANUAL check. As a result I had to keep bugging the FAs on the plane to refill my nalgene but seemed like they also expected that at least and were well equipped with plenty of water bottles. Also if you have a layover at Atlanta, they make you pick up any bags you checked, go through customs, and then check in again including going through TSA meaning mind your liquid rules. This was not the case for my outbound trip so perhaps its an international to US thing. I saw many people with duty free alcohol purchases on my first flight so I hope for their sake they did not have to transfer flights at ATL... Also all of this took around 45 minutes. Rest of my flights were uneventful thankfully. 

If you've gotten this far, thank you for reading my rambles, hope it helped in some way. ",1,1735874078.0,Patagonia,1,1.0,False
1hscp5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Business_Ideas/comments/1hscp5x/coffee_distribution_to_speciality_shops/,Coffee distribution to speciality shops ,"Hi, 
I was at a coffee shop that sells coffee with the name of the origin country, they sell around 15-20 coffee roasts from around the world. Both brew and bags. 
I noticed my country wasn’t their menu. I visited many other shops with the same business model and to my surprise none of them had it.


Since my country was one of the world’s leading coffee producers and exporters (former), I know it has good coffee. 

There are about 15 “gourmet” specialty coffee shops near me, most of them in very affluent areas. This would be enough to get me started. 

Do you think it’s a good idea?
Anyone in the coffee business, I would greatly appreciate your feedback.

1hscox5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1hscox5/just_some_new_dads_thought/,Just some new dad's thought ,"Hi all, I'm 31 and a new dad here. It might be a weird ass long text for some, a good opportunity to laugh at a Millennial for other and who know.. maybe a good read for a couple! It's been almost 3 months now that I'm a father and I'm at the peak of ""I can't do anything to entertain my kids beside talking, Tummy time and show him stuff he doesn't understand yet"". Most of the time, he sleep.. but he does not want to sleep by himself, always on me or mommy. You know it's always longer for Men to understand the reality to be a father, because we don't get pregnant, we don't have to change our lifestyle 9 months before he's there you now.

But now that I'm in it, I had to change a lot of my habits, it made me realize it's gonna be tough at some point.. put I'm always someone to adapt any situation. I'm a gamer and as someone who was alone almost all my 20's, I have to say it was pretty hard to not think about myself for long time. Mainly because it is not about myself anymore but about my son and her mother. I do crave those solitary moment I had, gaming late, binge watching horror movies, scrolling the social media but I can do that no longer.

Please, when some of y'all will get kids. Don't make the same mistakes my fellow Millennials did. Parenting is hard and it's accepting to not have much peace or time for yourself for a while. If you can't deal with this it's all fine to not have kids, but please.. Do not put a tablet, a phone, a tv in front of your kid's face. I think we all know what this is capable of at this point. Your kid crying at a restaurant, at some friend's house, putting a scene at the market.. it's all part of the game. Don't buy quick relief with screen time, it's gonna fuck them real hard later on.

I did some kind of ""detox"" of the screen while my girlfriend was pregnant. I was still gaming yes, but I deleted most social media I had on my phone at least. At the beginning it was literally painful I'm not gonna lie here.. Found myself more than once unlocking my phone just to scroll the menu until I realize it was now just a reflex to watch my phone, but that's another story.. Just to picture how it ca be difficult for a kid to rationalize these behavior and know when to stop when a grown man have difficulty to it. It's that crazy.

There is a lot you can do to entertain your kid beside that. Childhood is all about exploration, imagination, pretending, being silly and not giving a fuck. It's about going outside and being amazed by the grass, looking at the sky and wondering why it's up there, it's about drawing some ugly ass thing for you and as a parent you say ""Heyyy, that's so BEAUTIFUL"". It's about discovery, questioning, learning, being happy.

Well I'm not gonna stretch it too much, it has been a while already, just felt like writing all this while dead tired but unable to sleep, 5 coffee in my body, started to smoke again last night, cortisol level max.. But I'm holding on trying to be a good dad! I hope I didn't bore most of y'all, feel free to roast me, I could use a quick laugh before my nap. If you have anything to add, question or anything feel free to comment, I'd like some insight on this. Stay safe, Happy new year 2025 guys, GenZ are funny as shit <3

1hscovc,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1hscovc/what_ive_learned_from_my_longdistance_riding/,What I've learned from my long-distance riding buddies,"This comes up now and then, so I want to share my tips for riding motorcycles for long distances on interstate/superslab highways.

I'm not a real distance expert, but have ridden with multiple Iron Butt finishers and this is what I've learned, and what has allowed me to do 700-800 mile days which represent 12+ hours in the saddle. I'm using miles for everything here because so many of our users are in the US.

1. This is the most important one: *People crash when they make something else more important than not crashing. Nothing is more important than not crashing. If you find that you're in over your head, feeling too zoned out/tired/sore to concentrate or react properly, then STOP. You might just need a meal or some fresh air off the bike, or maybe you need to find the closest motel and stop for the night.*
2. Other than that, the overarching rule is to *make it easy for yourself.* You can't be at 100% attention or 100% physical exertion for more than a few minutes at a time. This isn't a sprint, it's a marathon.
3. Pace: If you keep it to \~70 mph on interstate/superslab, you'll move with traffic most places and not be a target for the cops. You also won't be too drained from the hyperattention required when you're trying to keep hustling all the time.
4. Stint length: at \~70 mph, you'll cover \~125 miles in \~1:45. It doesn't matter how fresh or strong you feel or how good the road is, take a break at about 1:45 for gas, pee, drink, smoke, snack, whatever. Start this break with the goal of being back on the bike and rolling again within 15 mins. Do a longer break for actual meals, but choose the time and place for those meals with a specific timeline in mind. *More on pace and breaking a big ride into stints at the end.*
5. This is a game of wear on your body's resources, and the key is to stay ahead of it. Drink before you're thirsty, pee before you're bursting, snack before you're hungry, and *stretch before you're stiff or sore.* My buddy who did 2,500 miles in less than 48 hours, and 11,000 miles in 14 days was doing stretches on his bike 10 minutes into a 90 minute ride. He'd roll his shoulders, swing each arm a bit, stand up, sit back, sit forward, lean forward, drop one leg, drop the other leg, etc. Stuff like that. Just so that he stayed loose and didn't get stiff or sore.
6. Wear LD/long distance bicycle shorts under your gear. The ones with the soft butt pad. You wear these as your undies, nothing underneath them. Hit your junk with Gold Bond or similar before you head out in the morning. Your crotch can become a serious problem for comfort if you don't take care of it.
7. Good ear plugs are important. Consider getting custom-molded silicone plugs. They're fairly cheap and last long (mine were 65 bucks 20 years ago). Because they fit perfectly, they don't start to wear on your ears the way expanding foam ones can.
8. There's no shame in using PEDs - specifically painkillers or anti-inflammatories. They can upset your stomach or cause temporary tinnitus, so you do want to use them sparingly, but once you do this for a while you'll get a sense of what works for you to keep you going. I do just like 1 extra strength Advil every 2 hours as long as I'm not hurting, and bump it to 2 every now and then if I am starting to feel stiff or sore.
9. Understand that there is a euphoria that comes from riding all day. You may feel a sudden rush of happiness and just feel invincible. It might come on when you see some beautiful scenery, or the sun comes out from behind a cloud, or you hit some milestone. That road high is your friend, you should enjoy it. But you should not respond by cranking up the speed, taking bigger risks, or staying extra-long in the saddle.

Further notes on pace/stints: Doing \~125 miles in \~1:45 then taking a break of \~15 minutes means that it's easy to break down your ride for the day. You can average 60 mph including those breaks all day if you have to. Gonna cover 600 miles? That's \~5 stints of about 2:00 each. So, add an hour for lunch, have breakfast at 6:00, be rolling at 7:00, and your riding day is done in time for supper at 6:00.

It works pretty well in metric, too. Do 200 km in 1:45, take a 15 minute break, and you're averaging 100 kph (including those short breaks) all day. Need to cover 1500 km? That's going to be 7 stints of 200 km each plus another 100 km. Have a coffee at 5:00, get rolling before 6:00, finish your first stint before you stop for a quick breakfast, do 3 more stints before a 45 minute lunch at about 2:00 PM, another 3 before you take as much time as you need for a nice but light supper starting at about 9:00 PM, then you're just one last stint from your destination. You should get there sometime around midnight. You've never had a tastier beer than the one you nurse in your motel room as you ease out of your boots on a day like that.

Those are the basics IME. Have fun out there!",10,1735874038.0,motorcycles,2,0.92,False

**UEC FLEET COMMISSIONING ORDER**  
From: United Earth Command (UEC) Central Fleet HQ  
To: Europa Shipyard Command  
Priority: High  
Subject: Commissioning of UES Vanguard  
""Effective immediately, Hull X-178 is officially commissioned as UES Vanguard. All fleet protocols and directives are now in effect. The Vanguard is to proceed with space trials under the supervision of the assigned trials crew. Operational readiness and systems integration are top priorities. Ensure all shipboard personnel adhere to established safety and testing protocols.""

**PERSONNEL ASSIGNMENT ORDER**  
From: UEC Personnel Division  
To: Lieutenant Althea Voss  
""Effective immediately, Lieutenant Althea Voss is assigned to the UES Vanguard as the officer overseeing stealth and sensor systems. Report to the Trials Command Officer for further directives. Your role is critical to the successful evaluation and integration of the Vanguard’s core systems.""

==

The atmosphere in Dock Nine was electric. Flags bearing the insignia of the United Earth Command hung from the towering scaffolds, and the glint of artificial light off the ship’s hull lent an air of solemnity. The crew of the newly christened UES Vanguard stood in formation, their uniforms crisp, as Admiral Seren took the stage. She stood at the podium, her crisp uniform reflecting her command’s authority. “Today, Vanguard represents the pinnacle of our technological achievements,” she declared, her voice resonating through the chamber. “But more than that, it represents hope. Hope for a secure future, for resilience in the face of threats, and for unity in our purpose.”

The ceremonial bottle of champagne shattered against the hull, a spray of glass and bubbles marking the ship’s formal induction into the fleet.

“Crew of the Vanguard,” Seren continued, turning to the assembled personnel. “Your mission begins now. May you serve with honor and bring distinction to this ship.”

“Attention!” barked the Trials Command Officer, and the crew snapped to salute, “Dismissed!”

Applause filled the air as the ship’s commissioning pennant was raised. Althea, standing among the junior officers, felt a swell of pride. Despite her exhaustion from the grueling weeks of preparation, she couldn’t help but smile as the Vanguard’s name was officially etched into history.

==

The formality of the ceremony gave way to the practicalities of preparing for space trials. Crew members filed aboard the Vanguard, their boots clanging against the metal gangways. Althea Voss was among them, her datapad clutched tightly as she took in the sight of the ship’s pristine interior.

At the daily briefing, Commander Raines, the Trials Command Officer, initiated the proceedings.

""Listen up,"" Raines said, his tone firm. ""We’ve got a long list of systems to test, and no margin for error. This isn’t just about the ship; it’s about the people aboard her. We succeed as a team or we fail as one.""

Althea sat near the back, her datapad already loaded with diagnostics checklists. She exchanged a glance with Kaito, who gave her a quick nod. The stakes were clear to everyone in the room.

""First up,"" Raines continued, ""is propulsion integration. Engineering, I need you at full readiness. Sensors and stealth teams, coordinate with navigation for baseline readings. Let’s make this a clean run.""

As she moved toward the hatchway out of the briefing, she heard a voice, “Lieutenant Voss,” she heard. She turned to see Commander Raines moving up. His weathered face was stern but not unkind. “Stealth and sensors, correct?”

“Yes, sir,” Althea replied.

“You’ll find your station on Deck Three.

“Yes, sir,” she said, moving quickly toward her assigned post.

==

The stealth and sensor systems bay was a hive of activity. Technicians worked at consoles, running final diagnostics on the ship’s advanced arrays. Althea joined them, her practiced eye scanning the displays for anomalies.

“Lieutenant,” one of the technicians said, looking up. “We’ve got a clean sweep on all primary systems. Shall we start integration tests?”

“Not yet,” Althea replied. “Let’s power up each system incrementally and run isolated tests first. No point in rushing.”

The Vanguard eased out of its docking clamps, its propulsion systems firing at minimal power. From the bridge, Commander Raines oversaw the process, his tone calm but firm.

“Engineering, report,” Raines said.

“Propulsion nominal,” came the reply. “All systems within safe parameters.”

“Good. Stealth systems, prepare for activation,” Raines ordered.

In the sensor bay, Althea and her team brought the stealth matrix online. The ship’s hum deepened as the matrix engaged, and the displays lit up with a faint shimmer of energy.

""All systems nominal,"" Kaito reported. ""Stealth matrix engaged and stable.""

""Wait,"" Althea said, her brow furrowing as an alert flashed across her console. ""I’m picking up a power fluctuation in the secondary stabilizers. It’s minor, but it’s not in the baseline.""

""Could it be a calibration error?"" Kaito asked.

""Unlikely,"" Althea replied. ""The readings are too specific. Let’s isolate the subsystem.""

As they worked, the fluctuation grew more pronounced. On the bridge, Raines received the report and called for an immediate diagnostic halt. ""Engineering, we need eyes on those stabilizers now.""

Chief Engineer Arden’s voice crackled through the comm. ""On it. Running a deep scan.""

In the depths of the ship, Arden’s team uncovered the culprit: a small, foreign device embedded in the stabilizer array. Its purpose was clear—to disrupt power flow during high-stress operations. The team worked quickly to remove it, documenting everything for Fleet Intelligence.

""This wasn’t an accident,"" Arden said grimly. ""Someone wanted this ship to fail.""

On the bridge, Raines’s expression darkened. ""Inform Fleet Command immediately. Lieutenant Voss, coordinate with Intelligence to analyze the device. I want to know who’s responsible.""

==

The discovery of sabotage sent ripples through the crew. Whispers of espionage spread, and trust became a fragile commodity. In the mess hall, Althea sat with Kaito and Reynard, their usual banter replaced by tense silence.

""It’s hard to believe someone would do this,"" Kaito said, breaking the quiet. ""Who sabotages their own fleet?""

""Someone with an agenda,"" Reynard replied. ""Or someone working for the Xandari.""

Althea nodded, her mind racing with possibilities. ""Whoever it is, they underestimated us. The Vanguard isn’t going down that easily.""

Despite the setback, the Vanguard continued its trials.

The initial tests were promising, but the true complexity lay in integrating the ship’s systems. As propulsion, stealth, and weapons systems began running simultaneously, issues quickly surfaced.

“Energy spikes in the aft relays,” Althea called out, her fingers flying over the console. “Stealth matrix is losing stability.”

“Can you isolate it?” Raines asked over the comm.

“Not without reducing propulsion output,” she replied.

“Do it,” Raines ordered. “Stability takes precedence.”

The team worked swiftly, rerouting power and recalibrating the affected systems. After tense minutes, the readings stabilized.

“Interference resolved,” Althea said, exhaling in relief.

“Well done,” Raines replied. “Let’s move on.”

==

By the end of the first day, the crew gathered in the mess hall for a brief respite. The atmosphere was relaxed but tinged with exhaustion.

“First day and we’re already troubleshooting like crazy,” said Lieutenant Kaito, dropping into a seat beside Althea.

“That’s the point of trials,” Althea replied, sipping her coffee. “Better we find the problems now than in a real fight.”

“Think she’ll hold up?” asked another crew member, gesturing toward the viewport, where the Vanguard’s silhouette loomed against the stars.

“She’ll hold,” Althea said, her voice firm. “She has to.”

As the ship entered its second day of trials, Althea found a quiet moment to herself on the observation deck. The stars stretched endlessly before her, and the ship’s faint hum was a comforting presence.

She placed a hand on the glass, gazing out at the expanse. “You’ve got a lot to prove,” she murmured to the ship. “But we’ll get there.”

Behind her, the door slid open, and Commander Raines stepped inside. “Good work today, Lieutenant. Keep it up.”

“Thank you, sir,” Althea replied, turning back to the stars.

On the observation deck, Raines and Seren watched as the ship maneuvered gracefully through space.

""She’s holding together,"" Seren said. ""But this sabotage… it’s a reminder that our enemies are closer than we think.""

Raines nodded. ""We’ll root them out. The Vanguard deserves nothing less.""

From: Europa Shipyard Command  
To: United Earth Command (UEC) Naval Oversight Division  
Priority: Standard  
Subject: Delays and Progress Updates on Hull X-178  
""Hull X-178 remains in the final construction phase, with ongoing work on core systems and structural reinforcement. The stealth matrix has passed preliminary stress tests, though integration with the propulsion system has revealed new challenges. Schedule adjustments have been logged, with space trials now projected for Fleet Reference Time 2158.6. Operational security measures remain heightened, and personnel vetting is ongoing following increased reports of active security concerns.""

==

Months had passed since the initial tests of the stealth matrix, and Europa Shipyard was in overdrive. Plasma torches lit the cavernous docks like artificial stars, their fiery arcs illuminating the immense form of Hull X-178. The air was thick with the hum of machinery and the clatter of tools as engineers and technicians worked to bring the vessel to life. The ship, now nearly complete, gleamed with an almost predatory elegance, its angular design a testament to cutting-edge engineering.

But with progress came complexity, and with complexity came setbacks.

Althea, like any other engineer, was used to setbacks. She had become a fixture in the stealth and sensor systems bay, her once-peripheral role expanding as challenges piled up. This morning, the challenge was propulsion interference—a persistent issue threatening to derail the entire integration process. She stood on the observation platform, watching as teams scrambled to install the final components of the propulsion system. Her datapad vibrated with alerts, each one detailing a new issue to be addressed.

The engineering bay was a flurry of activity, with technicians clustered around consoles displaying reams of diagnostic data. Althea joined Reynard and Kaito at the main control station, where a holographic projection of the ship’s systems flickered in mid-air.

“Reynard, where’s the latest diagnostic report?” Althea called as she paced the cramped bay.

Reynard, balancing a datapad on his forearm while tinkering with a relay, replied without looking up. “Coming through now. Spoiler alert: it’s still bad. We’ve got another problem with the integration protocols. Propulsion and stealth are throwing compatibility errors again.""

Althea pulled the report onto her holoscreen. The interference readings were worse than expected. “This doesn’t make sense. We adjusted the compensators two days ago.”

“And they bought us about five percent stability,” Reynard said. “But the drives are pulling too much energy, and the matrix can’t keep up.”

""Can we compensate?"" Althea asked.

""We’ve tried rerouting power,"" Reynard said, ""but the bleed is too high. We need to isolate the source of the demand spike.""

Althea frowned. ""Alright. Let’s run a full system simulation with the propulsion and stealth modules active. I want to see exactly where the bottleneck is.""

The team got to work, their hands flying over consoles as they initiated the simulation. The holographic projection shifted, displaying the ship’s power grid in real-time. As the simulation progressed, a red warning line appeared, snaking through the diagram.

“Alright,” Althea said, exhaling slowly. “Let’s isolate the propulsion system entirely. Run the stealth field solo and see if the problem persists. If it doesn’t, the drives are the culprit.”

Reynard raised an eyebrow. “You’re calling for a full decouple?”

“I’m calling for finding the root cause,” Althea shot back. “Unless you’ve got a better idea?”

Reynard grinned, holding up his hands. “Nope. Decouple it is.”

==

Hours later, the stealth matrix was running in isolation, its intricate nodes shimmering on the holographic display. The interference was gone.

“That’s what I thought,” Althea said, nodding to herself. “The propulsion integration’s the issue. Kaito, can we buffer the drive’s energy draw without destabilizing the matrix?”

Kaito tapped her screen, considering. “We could reroute through the auxiliary relays, and reinforce the relay couplings. It’ll take a few hours to set up.”

“Do it,” Althea said. “And send me the updated schematics when you’re done.”

As the team dispersed, Reynard lingered. “You know,” he said, “you’ve got a knack for this. Troubleshooting under pressure. Thinking ahead. It’s not exactly standard for a junior officer.”

Althea shrugged. “It’s just problem-solving.”

“It’s more than that,” Reynard said, his tone uncharacteristically serious. “You’ve got a good head for the bigger picture. People notice that.”

Althea didn’t reply, but Reynard’s words stayed with her as she returned to her station. The ship wasn’t ready, but it was getting there, piece by painstaking piece.

==

As the hours stretched into the night shift, Althea found herself alone in one of the shipyard’s quieter corridors. The relentless pace of work had taken its toll, and she leaned against the bulkhead, rubbing her temples.

The faint sound of approaching footsteps pulled her from her thoughts. It was Senior Chief Arden, carrying two steaming cups of coffee.

""Figured you could use this,"" Arden said, handing her one.

""Thanks,"" Althea replied, taking a grateful sip. The bitter liquid was a welcome jolt to her senses.

""You’ve been burning the midnight oil,"" Arden said. ""More than usual.""

""Comes with the job,"" Althea said. ""This ship has to be perfect.""

Arden studied her for a moment. ""It’s more than that, isn’t it?""

Althea hesitated, then nodded. ""It’s personal. My brother was stationed on the *Horizon*. He didn’t make it back. This ship… it feels like a chance to make sure no one else has to go through that.""

Arden nodded slowly. ""That’s a good reason to push yourself. Just don’t forget that you’re part of a team. You don’t have to carry this alone.""

Althea managed a small smile. ""Thanks, Chief.""

==

With the relay couplings reinforced, the team ran the final diagnostic tests. The propulsion and stealth systems hummed to life, their intricate interplay captured in a dazzling array of holographic projections. Althea and her team watched intently as the systems stabilized, the red warning lines disappearing one by one.

""Stabilizers are holding,"" Kaito reported. ""No anomalies detected.""

""Stealth matrix is green,"" Reynard added. ""We’re solid.""

Althea let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. ""Good work, everyone. Log the results and send them to Fleet Command.""

As the team dispersed, Althea lingered. She placed a hand on the console, her fingers brushing the cool metal. ""We’re almost there,"" she murmured. ""Almost.""

==

Late that evening, Althea was summoned to a private comm station. The UEC insignia on the screen flickered briefly before resolving into the sharp features of Admiral Seren.

“Lieutenant Voss,” Seren began without preamble. “I’ve been reviewing the progress reports from Europa. Your name comes up frequently.”

“Yes, Admiral,” Althea replied, her pulse quickening. “I’ve been overseeing the stealth and sensor systems integration.”

“And resolving more than your share of critical issues,” Seren said. “You’ve done exceptional work.”

“Thank you, Admiral,” Althea said. “But it’s a team effort.”

“Modesty is admirable, Lieutenant, but let’s not downplay your contributions,” Seren replied. “The fleet needs officers who can think beyond the manual. Officers who can adapt. Be ready. Your role in this isn’t over.”

The line disconnected, leaving Althea staring at the blank screen. Be ready. The words echoed in her mind, heavy with implication.

==

The following weeks were a blur of activity as the shipyard prepared for Hull X-178’s space trials. Every system was tested, retested, and integrated into the larger whole. The propulsion issue was resolved, the stealth matrix stabilized, and the ship’s weapons systems calibrated to exacting specifications.

Althea barely had time to sleep, let alone reflect. But as the final diagnostics came in, showing all systems green, she allowed herself a rare moment of satisfaction.

“Looks like she’s ready,” Reynard said, clapping Althea on the shoulder.

“She’s close,” Althea replied. “But we’ll see what the trials say.”

In the days that followed, the shipyard buzzed with preparations for Hull X-178’s upcoming space trials. The ship would then be officially named the UES Vanguard, and she was nearly ready to leave the dock.

But in the shadows of the shipyard, not everyone celebrated. A lone figure slipped through the maintenance corridors, their movements deliberate and practiced. The figure paused at a control panel, inserting a small device before disappearing into the maze of ducts and conduits.

Unaware of the act of sabotage, the crew continued their work, their focus on the future—a future that would soon test their resolve in ways they could not yet imagine.

==

The night before the ship’s departure from the shipyard, Althea stood alone on the observation deck, gazing at the vessel that had consumed so many months of her life. Hull X-178 gleamed under the artificial light, its angular form a promise of speed and power.

“It’s just a hull number,” she murmured. “But soon, you’ll have a name. And a mission.”

She let her hand rest briefly against the glass before turning away. Tomorrow, the real tests would begin.

==

Europa Shipyard was the crown jewel of humanity’s industrial ingenuity, an immense latticework of orbital docks above, and construction bays below, nestled under the icy shell of Jupiter’s moon. Here, in the shadow of Europa’s frozen crust, some of the UEC’s most advanced ships were born. Beneath the hum of machinery and the sharp glow of plasma torches, thousands of workers toiled day and night.

Hull X-178 was no exception. Suspended within a magnetic cradle, the skeletal framework of the ship dominated Dock Nine. Its angular lines hinted at speed and stealth, but the ship was far from complete. Teams of engineers swarmed over its surface, welding, calibrating, and testing every system with relentless precision.

The buzz of machinery and low thrum of heavy loaders reverberated through the dockyard’s cavernous expanse.

Lieutenant Althea Voss stood on an elevated platform, her gaze sweeping over the controlled chaos below. A datapad in hand, she reviewed the day’s progress reports. As a systems troubleshooter, her role was to address any anomalies that threatened the ship’s operational timeline—a task that demanded both technical expertise and unrelenting focus. Her role was straightforward: troubleshoot. Every day brought a new list of malfunctions, inefficiencies, or outright mysteries, and it was her responsibility to make them go away before the ship’s upcoming trials. She adjusted the holoscreen in front of her, the shimmering blueprint of Hull X-178 expanding to show the stealth matrix’s alignment protocols.

""Lieutenant,"" a voice called. Althea turned to see Reynard, one of the senior technicians, approaching with a grim expression. ""We’ve got another issue with the stealth matrix calibration. Sensors picked up a phase oscillation at high power.”

Althea suppressed a groan. “Location?”

“Section 14-Beta,” Reynard replied. “We’ve already isolated it to the alignment core, but it’s intermittent.”

""What’s the problem?"" Althea asked, already pulling up the schematics.

""Phase alignment drift,"" Reynard said. ""It’s subtle, but it’ll destabilize the entire matrix if it’s not fixed.""

""Alright,"" Althea said, tucking her datapad under her arm. ""Let’s take a look.""

==

As Althea descended into the bowels of the shipyard, her mind wandered to the stories she’d heard from the older engineers. Many of them had served during the Martian Rebellion, where improvised warships were cobbled together in shipyards far less advanced than this one. The scars of that conflict still lingered, shaping the attitudes of those who now worked tirelessly to ensure that the Vanguard—as Hull X-178 was tentatively known—would be a ship worthy of its mission.

""You know,"" Reynard said as they walked, ""I worked on some of the frigates used in the final push to retake Deimos. Those ships were a mess. This one, though? She’s something else.""

""Let’s hope she’s enough,"" Althea replied, her tone neutral. ""The stakes are higher now.""

==

By the time Althea reached Section 14-Beta, a small team of engineers had already gathered.

The stealth matrix calibration station was a maze of cables and glowing consoles. Technicians worked quietly, their faces lit by the bluish hue of holographic displays. Althea stepped up to the primary console and examined the data streams.

""Alright,"" she said, gesturing to Kaito, the lead technician on duty. ""Show me the drift.""

Kaito keyed in a command, and a holographic projection of the stealth matrix’s phase alignment appeared. A faint red line wavered across the diagram.

""What’s the root cause?"" Althea asked.

""We’re still narrowing it down,"" Kaito replied. ""It could be a power distribution issue or a software fault.""

“It’s subtle,” Kaito said, pointing to a diagnostic display. “You can barely see it, but the phase alignment drifts by about 0.02%. It’s enough to throw off the stealth field under stress, and under stress the drift will amplify.”

Althea examined the readout, her brow furrowing. “That’s close to the tolerances for failure. Have we run a simulation on what happens at full load?”

“Not yet,” Reynard admitted. “We were waiting for your call.”

“Run it now,” Althea ordered. She stepped back as the team initiated the simulation. The holographic projection of the stealth matrix lit up, its intricate web of interconnected nodes glowing a faint blue. A moment later, the display flickered red.

“Catastrophic collapse,” Kaito said grimly. “Field integrity drops to zero within ten seconds.”

“Not acceptable,” Althea said. “Alright, let’s strip it down and recalibrate the core.”

Reynard hesitated. “Lieutenant, recalibrating the core could delay our testing schedule. Do we have clearance for that?”

Althea met his gaze, her tone firm. “If we send this ship into trials with a compromised stealth system, there won’t be a schedule left to worry about. Get clearance if you need to, but start the work now.”

""Let’s isolate it,"" Althea said, pulling up the relevant subsystems. ""Reynard, start by rerouting power through auxiliary relays. Kaito, run a simulation with adjusted parameters.""

Hours later, Althea leaned against a support beam, her gloves streaked with conductive gel. The recalibration was nearly complete, but the day’s grind weighed on her. Around her, the shipyard buzzed with activity, a symphony of voices, tools, and machinery.

“You look like you could use a break,” a voice said. Althea turned to see Senior Chief Arden, one of the shipyard’s supervisors, holding out a mug of steaming coffee.

“Thanks,” she said, taking the cup gratefully. “Long day.”

“They all are,” Arden replied with a chuckle. “But you’re making a name for yourself, Voss. Word is the higher-ups are impressed.”

Althea shrugged. “I’m just doing my job.”

“Maybe so,” Arden said, his gaze shifting to Hull X-178. “But that ship’s going to need someone who knows her inside and out. Someone who can keep her alive out there.”

Althea didn’t respond, but the weight of his words lingered. She turned back to the shimmering hull of the ship, its angular design radiating purpose. If Arden was right, her role here was only the beginning.

==

The recalibration of the stealth matrix completed, Althea and her team ran the final diagnostics. This time, the simulation held steady, the stealth field glowing a steady blue throughout the stress test.

“No anomalies,” Kaito reported, her voice tinged with relief. “We’re good to go.”

Althea allowed herself a small smile. “Nice work, everyone. Log the results and submit them for approval.”

As the team dispersed, Althea lingered. The shipyard was quieter now, the bulk of the day’s work complete. She walked slowly along the length of the massive hull, her footsteps echoing against the cold metal. Hull X-178 loomed above her, its angular lines hinting at strength and purpose. She paused at the bow, brushing her gloved hand across its surface.

“It’s just a hull number,” she murmured to herself, a rare flicker of superstition slipping into her thoughts. “But it’s going to be so much more.”

For now, it was Hull X-178. But soon, it would be a ship ready to face the stars.

During the walk back to the mess to grab a much needed cup of coffee, she found herself on an observation deck overlooking the shipyard. Through the reinforced glass, she could see Hull X-178 suspended in its magnetic cradle, its unfinished form a stark contrast to the gleaming ships in the adjacent docks.

""Impressive, isn’t it?"" a voice said. Althea turned to see Senior Chief Arden, a veteran supervisor, standing beside her.

""It is,"" Althea replied. ""But she’s far from ready.""

""She’ll get there,"" Arden said. ""And when she does, she’ll be the finest ship in the fleet.""

Althea nodded, her gaze fixed on the ship. ""Let’s hope she’s enough for what’s coming.""

==

As the weeks passed, the pace of construction intensified. Rumors of Xandari incursions filtered through the shipyard, adding an edge to every conversation. Althea noticed the tension in her colleagues, their jokes more strained, their tempers shorter.

One evening, as she reviewed diagnostic logs in her quarters, a priority message from Fleet Command appeared on her console. It was a briefing on recent Xandari activity near the Oort Line—and a reminder that the Vanguard’s completion was a matter of urgency.

Althea leaned back in her chair, the weight of responsibility pressing down on her. The ship wasn’t just another project. It was humanity’s answer to an escalating threat, and failure was not an option.

1hscllr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortSadStories/comments/1hscllr/the_empty_chair/,The Empty Chair,"Every morning, my mom and I sat at the kitchen table, the soft morning light filtering through the curtains, painting the room with a golden glow. The smell of coffee brewing was the soundtrack to our mornings, filling the air with a comforting warmth that always felt like home. We talked about everything and nothing—her plans for the day, the latest news she’d read, what we were having for dinner that night, and the occasional silly thing that would make us both laugh uncontrollably. Those moments were small, but they were the heartbeat of our relationship, the threads that kept us connected.

The first morning without her felt like a cruel joke. I woke up to the usual sound of the coffee maker gurgling in the kitchen, a sound that had been a part of my life for as long as I could remember. But something was different. The house felt too quiet, too empty. I didn’t think much of it at first. She was probably just running a little late—maybe she’d stayed up late watching a movie or reading. I knocked on her door softly, expecting to hear her voice on the other side, telling me to come back later.

When there was no answer, I tried the handle. The door creaked open, revealing her sitting in the same chair she always sat in, her hands folded in her lap. The room was still, too still, and the silence that filled the space suddenly felt suffocating. It took me a moment to register what I was seeing, and in that moment, everything froze. My heart raced as I rushed to her side, calling her name, but there was no response. Her skin was cold, her face pale and unmoving.

Panic set in as I shook her gently, hoping—no, praying—that she would open her eyes, that this was some cruel misunderstanding. But it wasn’t. I called for help, my voice shaking, but I knew deep down it was too late. The warmth that had once filled the room was gone, replaced by an overwhelming coldness that seeped into my bones.

The paramedics arrived minutes later, but they were just as helpless as I was. There was nothing they could do. My mom, the woman who had always been my rock, the one who made everything seem okay, was gone.

The days that followed were a blur of shock, grief, and disbelief. I found myself wandering through the house, unable to comprehend the reality of what had happened. I didn’t know how to function without her. She had been there for everything—my first heartbreak, my triumphs, my failures. She was the one who stayed up late with me when I couldn’t sleep, who always knew just what to say when I felt lost. Now, it was as if the world had stopped spinning, and I was caught in an endless void of emptiness.

Her funeral was small. She wasn’t the type to want anything extravagant, and that’s exactly how she would have wanted it. Still, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of wrongness as I sat there, surrounded by people who had known her, but none of us truly knowing how to say goodbye. She was simply... gone. The finality of it was crushing.

I moved through the motions of life, trying to keep up appearances, but everything felt off. The house that had once been filled with laughter and conversation now felt suffocatingly quiet. The kitchen table, once the center of our mornings, was now just a reminder of the hole in my heart. Every morning, I would wake up to the same routine: the smell of coffee brewing, the sound of it filling the air, but there was no one sitting across from me. No warm smile to greet me, no one to ask how I slept or what I planned to do that day. It was just me, alone in the silence.

The chair at the table remained empty, an ever-present reminder of what I had lost. At first, I tried to convince myself that I could just push through, that I could move on and find a new rhythm without her. But that empty chair, that absence in the room, kept pulling me back to the reality that she was never coming back. It didn’t matter how many times I went through the motions, how many times I tried to fill the silence with other things—her absence was always there, right in front of me.

I would sit there in the mornings, staring at the empty chair, waiting for her to walk in, to tell me about her day, to ask me about mine. But that never happened. The silence would stretch on, unbearable and suffocating. I would sip my coffee, but it didn’t taste the same. The warmth, once comforting, now felt hollow. I would stare out the window, watching the world go by, but nothing seemed to matter anymore. Without her, the world felt different—distant, cold, and uninviting.

I tried to keep myself busy. I cleaned the house, rearranged things, even cooked meals, but no matter what I did, I couldn’t escape the empty chair. It was always there, always waiting, always reminding me that things would never be the same. And then, one day, I realized something: I wasn’t just waiting for her to come back. I was waiting for the pain to go away, for the ache in my chest to disappear, for the grief to lift and allow me to move on. But the truth was, I didn’t want that. I didn’t want to forget her, to let go of the memories that were now all I had left. I didn’t want to stop feeling the loss, because to do that would be to stop honoring her, to stop cherishing everything she had given me.

So I kept sitting at the table, every morning, the empty chair across from me a silent witness to my grief. I kept talking to her, even though I knew she couldn’t hear me. I told her about my day, about the small things that made me smile or the things that made me cry. And every time, I imagined her sitting there, smiling back at me, offering the comfort that only she could give. The chair remained empty, but in my mind, she was always there, listening, understanding.

I don’t know how long it will take for the pain to ease, or if it ever will. But every day, I sit at that table, the coffee brewing, the light streaming in, and the empty chair across from me. And I find that, little by little, I am learning to live with the silence.",1,1735873765.0,ShortSadStories,0,1.0,False

2024 was a momentous year for Kendu.

Second memecoin of all time to complete certik organically. Second to have our own dedicated stocktwits page as a memecoin.

We have created a genuine community with a culture unalike. An ethos of work and a built understanding of the required dedication to the grind.

We have operated under the guise of “we do not gamble, we work” and done everything organically.

No KOLs, no paid marketing, no nothing. 

With this - we achieved a 280M ATH before the bullrun. This was achieved with a community more than half the size we are now. We have IRL branding such as the energy drinks and coffee, engagement that is unmatched and even community members with tattoos.

We have an IRL community that is built on friendship, inspiration and belonging. Friendships have been forged and connections built.

2024 is one we should look at with a feeling of accomplishment, but also as an opportunity for reflection.

Now we look down the barrel of 2025, ahead of us is a momentous task.

The billions do not come easily, complacency is a trap that can be fallen in to at any moment and full activation is required.

Kendu is a vehicle to success for all of us.

I ask of all of you though, myself included - what more could you do for Kendu?

Reflect on your output for 2024 and think - is what I did enough to push Kendu to the billions?

A billion marketcap achievement requires the full activation of every single one of us. All of us using our individual skills, networks and abilities to get the Kendu name out there as much as possible. To bring in as many holders and possible and to perpetuate our movement in to millions of new minds. 

Critical mass will come, and it is up to us to determine how quickly.

It is constantly reiterated but has never been more critical than now - we are ALL equally important. 

We ALL have the ability to play as large a roll as possible in the story of pushing Kendu in to the top 10 cryptos.

So many members of this community worked extremely hard. Dedicated day after day to the cause knowing that the work put in today will be realised this year.

Even if we all just did 1% more than we did last year - the exponential effect of that will be incredible.

Maybe you only did a tweet a day, could you do two?

Maybe you only did certik, could you like and RT some more posts?

Our community is incredible. We have so many achievements under our belt and so many of us live and breathe Kendu.

We only have a few more months, going off past cycles, until alt season kicks in and our minds are melted.

It is of utmost importance now that we look inwards and activate completely, with the goal of financial freedom and getting Kendu to where it has always been destined to be - at 100B.

We must ensure Kendu is placed in an absolute optimal position to ride the cycle to the top. The work we put in now is what determines that.

You hold within your palm so much more power than you may realise. 

Kendu is your canvas, and I ask you to paint.

2025 will be the year of Kendu.

It was a crisp autumn morning in the small town of Mayberry, and Andy Griffith was sitting at his desk in the sheriff’s office, sipping on a cup of coffee and catching up on the usual paperwork. The hum of the town was peaceful as usual, with children laughing as they made their way to school and folks chatting on the streets. But this morning, a call would come in that would shake the very core of their tranquil community.

Barney Fife, the well-meaning but often overzealous deputy, was pacing nervously around the office, rehearsing what he’d say to Thelma Lou when she asked him about his day. Just then, the phone rang, cutting through the quiet.

Andy picked up the receiver, his voice calm as always. ""Sheriff's office, Andy Griffith speaking.""

The voice on the other end was frantic. ""Sheriff, there's been an incident at the school. A student... he’s got a gun. We need help—right now.""

Andy’s eyes narrowed. He wasn’t sure he had heard right. “A gun, you say? At the school?”

“Yeah, it’s bad, Sheriff. He’s threatening the kids. He’s inside the building right now!”

Andy stood up, his calm demeanor never wavering, even as the adrenaline began to course through his veins. He turned to Barney, who was already at attention, his eyes wide with concern.

“Barney,” Andy said, voice steady but urgent. “We’ve got trouble down at the school. We need to move—now.”

Barney’s face turned pale, but his sense of duty kicked in immediately. He was a little man, but when it came to matters of law and order, he was always determined to do his best—even if he did tend to get a little overzealous. “I-I’m ready, Andy! I’ll take the lead! You just follow my lead!”

Andy, with his customary patience, shook his head slightly. ""Barney, let’s just keep our heads. We don’t know what we’re walking into. Just follow me, and we’ll figure it out.""

They hopped into the squad car, and Andy gunned the engine, the tires kicking up a cloud of dust as they sped toward the school. As they arrived, they could see a handful of parents gathered outside, looking frantic. The school was eerily quiet, save for the occasional shout from inside.

The doors were locked, but Andy and Barney wasted no time. They quickly assessed the situation, seeing the flashing lights of the squad cars from the state police who had arrived just before them.

""Andy, you’ve got to let me go in first,"" Barney insisted, his voice rising slightly as he gripped his service revolver with both hands. ""I’m the deputy here. This is my job.""

Andy took a deep breath, glancing at the school windows. ""Barney, I know you're eager to help, but this is a delicate situation. You need to stay calm.""

Before Barney could protest further, a teacher—Ms. Delaney—burst through the doors, her eyes wide with fear. “Sheriff! Deputy! It’s the student—Johnny Mathis. He’s in the gym. He’s got a gun and he’s waving it around.”

Johnny Mathis. Andy knew the boy. A quiet kid, a little too introverted, but never one to show signs of violence. Something had clearly gone wrong.

“We need a plan,” Andy said, his voice low and calm. “Barney, you stay with Ms. Delaney. I’m going in.”

Barney, still trembling slightly, swallowed hard but nodded. “You got it, Andy.”

Inside the school, Andy’s boots echoed in the halls as he made his way toward the gymnasium. He moved with purpose, but there was no sense of rush in his movements. The gym doors were closed, and he paused for a moment, listening. He could hear the muffled sound of voices inside, and then—disturbingly—there was a loud bang.

He motioned for the officer from the state police to follow, but kept the group tight and together. ""No heroics, fellas,"" he whispered. ""We move in carefully.""

They crept up to the gym doors, and Andy gently pressed his ear to the wood. Through the faint noise of a scuffle, he could make out a few words—Johnny’s voice, shaking, panicked. ""Stay away! Stay back! I’ll... I’ll do it! I swear, I’ll do it!""

Andy’s heart sank. He had been in enough tough situations to know that a scared person with a gun was one of the most dangerous things. But he also knew that Johnny wasn’t evil. This wasn’t about hurting anyone—it was about fear and desperation.

He turned to the officers. ""Stay here. I’m going in alone.""

Barney had followed Andy at a distance, his eyes wide as he peered down the hall. “Andy! What are you doing?! You can’t go in there alone!”

But Andy’s expression was unreadable. “I’ve got to talk to him, Barney. It’s the only way.”

Barney stood frozen in place, watching as Andy stepped into the gym. The large, empty space felt even bigger under the harsh fluorescent lights, casting shadows on the basketball court. Johnny was in the center of the gym, the gun held loosely in his hands but shaking.

“Johnny,” Andy’s voice was firm but gentle. “It’s Sheriff Griffith. I know you’re scared. But there’s no need for this. No one wants to hurt you. You don’t have to do anything you’ll regret.”

Johnny’s eyes darted back and forth, his breath ragged. He was just a kid—probably no older than fifteen—lost in a world that had pushed him to the brink.

“I—I don’t know what to do anymore, Sheriff. I… I just want it to stop.”

Andy took a step closer, careful not to make any sudden movements. ""I know it feels like everything’s falling apart, but hurting others won’t fix it. You're not alone, Johnny. People care about you. Your friends, your teachers, your family… even folks like me. We can get through this together.""

For a moment, there was silence. Johnny’s shoulders sagged, the gun lowering just slightly. Andy took another step forward, his heart pounding.

“Let me help you, son,” Andy said softly. ""You don’t have to be afraid. You don’t have to do this.""

Tears welled in Johnny’s eyes as he looked at the sheriff, then at the gun in his hands. The weight of the world seemed to crash down on him. He dropped the weapon, the clatter of it hitting the floor echoing in the gym.

Barney, who had been holding his breath just outside the door, rushed in as soon as he saw the gun fall. He grabbed Johnny gently, guiding him away from the weapon.

Andy exhaled deeply, his face calm but filled with a quiet relief. He knew that no one in Mayberry would ever forget this day—not because of the gun or the fear—but because of the way the situation was handled. With patience. With understanding. And with compassion.

As they led Johnny out of the gym, Andy looked back at Barney, who was still standing there, wide-eyed.

“Well, Deputy,” Andy said with a wry smile. “Looks like we’ve got a little bit of paperwork ahead of us.”

Barney looked at him, still processing the ordeal. “I-I didn’t do anything, Andy. You handled it all.”

Andy gave him a gentle clap on the back. “Sometimes, Barney, the best thing you can do is just be there. That’s all anyone needs.”

And with that, the town of Mayberry, once again, was reminded of the quiet heroism of its sheriff, and how a steady hand and a calm heart could make all the difference in a world that seemed a little too loud at times.

And I’m ranting because this is no ordinary bad experience. I roll into the drive-thru for my usual—a grande iced caramel macchiato with light ice. Simple, right? WRONG. First, they got my order wrong. Instead of light ice, it was basically an iceberg with a splash of coffee. Like, am I paying $6 for coffee, or a cup of arctic vibes? And then the caramel drizzle? Nonexistent. I’m talking a *single, sad streak* across the lid like they were rationing for the apocalypse. Why do I have to inspect my drink like it’s a failed science experiment every time?

Second, why does it feel like I’m being judged for every customization? I asked for oat milk instead of regular milk, and the barista gave me that “oh, you’re *that* person” look. Sorry for not wanting my stomach to implode, Susan! I get that you’re busy, but if I’m paying almost $10 for a drink and a pastry, I’d like to not feel like I’m ruining someone’s day by being lactose intolerant. It’s like the unspoken rule of Starbucks is: “We can be a little wrong, but YOU can’t be even slightly demanding.” Make it make sense.

Lastly, can we talk about the drive-thru line? Why is it a 25-minute ordeal every single time? Every single day. This isn’t an artisanal bakery; it’s coffee. I’m convinced people in front of me are writing their orders in iambic pentameter and getting custom whipped cream sculptures. Meanwhile, I’m sitting there wondering if I should just cut my losses and go to Dunkin. Anyway, I know this isn’t the end of the world, but Starbucks, PLEASE, get it together.

Did I make a mistake as can't stop thinking about someone else?,"Me and my boyfriend got together in 2015, we were each others first serious relationship, he was my first everything, and I ultimately believed in the fairytale happy ending for us. I appreciate this was naive of me but I was in love and knew no better. For the first year of being together I don't remember any major arguments or reasons to mistrust him, I never doubted him because I never had any reason to, he made me feel like the most loved and special person alive. I remember the first time I discovered that I wasn't the only girl he had eyes for, I had been visiting him at uni at found messages with another girl online. She was in another country so I knew it was only talk, nothing physical. And so after confronting him about it, and there being lots of tears and emotions on both our behalves, I let it go and we moved on.

Over the years there were many more instances of discovering messages to different girls online. Each time there'd be another excuse, each time I stretch the boundaries just that little bit more and say this was the last time I'd put up with it. It never was the last time, I couldn't walk away from him. My home life wasn't/isn't particularly good, and whilst my relationship with him wasn't particularly strong at this point, I craved the stability and familiarity that he brought.

Up until 2022 I Had truly believed that nothing more had ever happened than online interactions. I was wrong. Days before our anniversary I remember seeing her name pop up on his phone, a WhatsApp from that he was quick to swipe away. I had this feeling in my stomach but I said nothing and chose to ignore it. Despite this, he fired away excuse of how ""she's someone I work with"" ""she's a lesbian its nothing like that"". I hadn't asked so I thought maybe it could've been true since he'd told me unprompted. But sometimes you just know, you get that sinking feeling in your stomach that convinces you otherwise. I'm not ashamed to admit I looked at his phone that night. She wasn't a lesbian, she was the girl he'd been spending all his time with while working away (military). They would go to each others rooms to watch tv and play video games and texted the way one does when entering a new relationship, when everything is flirty and lovely. I confronted him, he broke down. He admitted they had kissed but swore blind it was nothing more. I wasn't convinced and we ended up taking a break for a few months. Despite not being together, we still spoke everyday, sometimes menial chit chat and sometimes emotional and raw conversations that would leave me shaking in tears questioning how I could still love this man and why I wasn't enough. You probably won't be surprised to hear we ended up back together, you'll probably be even less surprised to hear that I later found out it was in fact more than a kiss. This revelation actually came from the other woman who's number I had obtained from his phone. She confirmed it had gone the whole way, when he had visited her flat after they no longer worked together. He vehemently denied sleeping with her until January 2024, until he eventually caved and told me things had gone further than the initial kiss he admitted to.

We fell back into another period of not being in a relationship yet still talking almost daily still. During this time I decided to try dating apps as I had only know being with my boyfriend up to this point. I hated it, I didn't connect with any of those men and found it to be an experience that was boring and meaningless. Other than meeting someone for a coffee, nothing further ever happened.

However, I did start to develop a bit of a crush during this time on a coworker. I had been working alongside them for about a year at this point and had always thought they were good looking and got along quite well with them. Until now I had never really considered them as anything more than a coworker, but I now found myself putting more effort in on day when I knew I would see them, or I would get to work a little earlier for to have a chat with them. There was even a night where we went for a drink after a shift (not an unusual occurrence, myself and a few coworkers often would go after a tough shift), and afterwards he walked me to the car to make sure I got back safe. From that point on, I was smitten, but convinced it was all in my head and there was no way he would ever be remotely interested in me. My self-esteem was shattered after years of having the man I loved go behind my back to other woman.

A few months passed and there was a work night out to celebrate an occasion. Everyone attended and the drinks were flowing, and we were all having a great time dancing the night away. At some point a remixed version of a pretty sad song plays and somehow I've found myself in a half dance-half hug with the coworker. The song ends and we end up stood off to the side away from the group, it was clear that the dance had been more than just a dance. It was at this point he leaned down and whispered over the music that he liked me, like really liked me. It turned to a kiss. It turned to many a kiss that night, but nothing more. We proceeded to chat over texts and even went on a couple of dates over a couple of weeks. I couldn't believe it was actually happening, and I really enjoyed the time we spent together. We had stuff in common and the conversation flowed easily. I felt like I could be myself and it was enough, he was happy to be there with me.

So you're probably wondering if it was so great what happened? Well, like I said I was still talking to the original boyfriend. He got inside my head, talking about how he knew he'd messed, how he loved me and how great I was but he hadn't appreciated it. The real kicker; He told me how he'd almost bought a ring a few months and spoken to his mum about it. All I had believed in for the last 8/9 years was that I was going to spend the rest of my life with this man and that was what was supposed to make me happy. I found myself back with him and told the coworker that I couldn't continue seeing him as my head wasn't in it. This all happened in May 2024.

Fast forward to now, December 2024. I've been back with the original guy since May and haven't talked to the coworker since (I now work in a different location, irrelevant to this whole situation). So why do I still think about him most days? I'm not happy with my boyfriend because I have zero trust in him. It has been shattered over the years and there's not really been a massive amount of effort to change that. We are supposed to looking to move in together in the New Year. Can I remain in a relationship I'm pretty sure I cannot be fully happy in and don't feel as though I can be myself for the sake of financial security and stability.

Part of me really wants to reach out the the guy I worked with and apologise. I don't know why, it wouldn't achieve anything I'm sure. But I want him to know I'm sorry that I hurt him. That he managed to make me feel so happy, appreciated and comfortable in those couple of weeks. I miss him and I often find myself wondering about what could have been and how things would be different.

Basically I'm stuck between the old classic of head or heart. I'm putting it out to strangers on the internet because my friends all have pretty strong opinions on the situation and they also know the coworker guy so it's a bit awkward. Plus writing on here is cheaper than therapy I suppose haha.

TLDR: I (26F) stayed with my ex (27M) despite being cheated on and now I think I made a mistake by not giving it a fair go with someone else after we broke up temporarily. Debating what my future should hold.",2,1735873459.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

\*\*\*Really long read, so I very much appreciate all of those who do take the time to read and help answer my question.\*\*\*

 

Could really use some helpful advice on here as I am trying to wrap my head around my current situation, and I would like to see if anybody on here has had a similar experience when it comes to waiting on a girl.

Long story short, I have known this girl for about 2 years now, where we first met during a summer internship. The first year of our internship was nothing more than being friendly, as during the majority of the time she was dating someone else. Fast forward to this past summer, year 2 of our internship; I and she hit things off kind of quick. The summer began with her still dating her previous partner, and even though it was something we should not have done with regards to her relationship at the time, we would hang out together (go to the gym, coffee, etc.) as nothing more than casual friends. About a few weeks of us hanging out turned into her telling me that she and her boyfriend broke up, which then led to one thing after the other.

We never officially started dating until I asked her out in October, but ever since the beginning, I had a feeling that we would break up. Not because of the fact that our relationship had gone sour, but due to the fact that she and I knew that she had a lot to heal from. Her previous relationship that she had gotten out of over the summer was nothing short of abusive. She dated him for about two years and was kind of brainwashed into being stuck with him. On top of that, she has dealt with a lot of past trauma from previous partners who mistreated her poorly.

It seemed like things were going fine between us towards the end of the summer, as it seemed like she was starting to find herself again after her 2-year relationship. I always told her that if she needed time to heal and needed space from me, I would give it to her, but she always declined, saying that I was helping her greatly. Although it seemed fine until she returned home to find terrible news regarding her parents relationship.

Through our whole relationship, everything seemed great when we were together. We were both madly in love, and we always told each other how we had this chemistry between us that we had never before experienced with anyone else. I am religious as well, and she shares the same faith in me, which also boosted our relationship, as she was able to push me better as a Christian, and I was able to push her to become better as well.

Everything between us would always go great until it was time for me to leave her, where she would be left to her thoughts. Every time she would find herself alone, she did not know what to think of herself and would constantly find herself thinking about things from the past that she had never healed from. It started to get worse recently as she moved back home with her parents for the time being until she starts her new job, and it seems like all of her past and current traumas are adding on top of each other.

With everything she is dealing with, we both came to the conclusion that she needs time to heal and figure out who she is. There is no bad blood between each other. She knows and I know that we both love each other, but right now is just not the time for us to be together, as she needs to heal and learn how to be herself again.

My question to all of you is how should I approach this situation? Have any of you ever been in anything similar where you thought it was worthwhile to wait on a girl? My gut tells me day after day that she is worth it and that I should wait, but I do not want to fool myself.

Thank you to those that read this and give their input.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

1hscdgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hscdgv/aitah_for_being_upset_with_my_wife_over_her_gifts/,AITAH for being upset with my wife over her gifts for me,"**AITAH for leaving my wife and stepson stranded on Christmas after I found out she gave him my big Christmas gift?**

My wife (F, 41) is terrible at gift-giving. We've been together for over 3 years, and after the first year of no birthday, anniversary, Christmas, Valentine's, or Mother's Day gifts (she even told me, “I’m not your mother” on Mother's Day), I decided to start matching her energy.

Father's Day came, and I was gone all day. Normally, I would have made a big lunch/dinner, and driven 30-45 minutes to pick up her son (J, 12). She called me in the afternoon, and when I asked when I was picking him up, she said she had plans and didn’t know it was her responsibility. When I said, “It’s Father’s Day,” she replied, “You’re not my father.” 

Predictably, I got upset, and I knew no productive conversation would happen. So, I left a letter explaining how hurt I was by the lack of effort from her. Later, she did drive to pick up J, but I could tell there was tension. Background info: she has the car, since I drive trucks for a living.

Over time, she started matching the energy back and began to get me gifts, but it always felt transactional: “Pick something out, and I’ll pay for it.” This went the same for her son, too, and I ended up doing most of the shopping for her family’s birthdays and holidays. 

Fast forward to a week before Christmas: I woke up to my favorite coffee drink and my wife taking me out to breakfast, followed by a trip to the mall to pick out my Christmas gift. I never splurge on myself. I have a 12-year-old son from a previous relationship, and most of my spending goes toward him. But my stepson, on the other hand, is materialistic and often asks for expensive things. I was already saving up for a new purse because mine was falling apart, and I had my eye on a designer one for months. 

We got to the store, and when I saw my dream purse, I was ecstatic. My wife hesitated at the price, but I told her I had been saving, and I was happy to contribute to it. She said she would buy it for me but reminded me that since it was a big-ticket item, I couldn’t expect any other gifts. I was beyond happy and told her that was enough. 

Later, she said she had to get something for her son and asked if I minded if they went Christmas shopping together. I had lots to do at home, so I agreed. I left my new purse with her, thinking she would surprise me with something in it on Christmas morning.

The days before Christmas were a blur. I hosted Christmas Eve at my house and slept in on Christmas morning, exhausted. We headed out to pick up her son, and on the drive to her mother’s house, I woke up and saw him holding my purse in the back seat. My heart dropped.

“Where did you get that purse?” I asked, and the car went silent. My wife stayed quiet, staring ahead. I asked him again, this time more firmly. He mumbled, “Mom gave it to me.” 

I was stunned. “WHAT?! Why would you think it was okay to give him my purse?” I shouted. My wife told me to calm down, but I wasn’t having it. I told him to give it back, but he refused. I was filled with a mix of anger and heartbreak, so I covered my face with my coat and cried quietly. My wife pulled over at a gas station, and her son rushed out of the car with the purse in hand. 

She tried to comfort me, but I slapped her hand away. I told her I was hurt, and I couldn’t believe she had done this. She explained that her son had been asking for a designer gift for weeks and had been disappointed not to get one. She said she gave him the purse to make up for it, knowing how much I had spent on him already. She told me she would make it up to me, but I wasn’t convinced. My purse was the only gift I had asked for, and now it was gone.

I couldn’t hold it together. I excused myself from the car, got in the driver's seat, and drove off, leaving my wife and stepson behind. I turned off my phone and spent the day with my family. I didn’t answer any of her calls. 

When I finally did pick up, it was a call from her ex-husband’s side, who had left me a nasty voicemail accusing me of being jealous. I told her I wasn’t jealous, just hurt that my wife had so little respect for me. My wife apologized, but it felt hollow. The damage was done.

Later that night, I found out that my brother-in-law went to pick them up, and the story got out. Her family sided with me, and everyone else was furious with her for letting her son take my gift. But things haven’t been the same since. I’ve been distant, and while we talk, it’s mostly about logistics and nothing personal. When we’re in bed together, she reaches for me, but I just can’t connect. The disappointment is too much. 

I miss her when she’s on the road, but the feeling of being betrayed lingers. I’m not sure what to do, and I want to know if I’m in the wrong here.

Does anyone else just love the feeling of snuggling up by the fireplace in the winter? Hot chocolate (with marshmallows), tea, coffee and cookies. What's better than that?
Well it just so happens that I have a nice fireplace but noone to share it with. 

I'd love to find the right lady to come snuggle up with and watch some horror/action flicks. Bonus points to you if you love horror movies and popcorn.

I've been moving towards more vegan food for heart health (high cholesterol) which is why I was trying to find a B12 supplement that works for me this past year. I have not yet had my B12 levels tested, and I have not had genetic testing. The past few months my anxiety has skyrocketed and is intolerable. 

The more I read the more these traits seem to be potentially linked, and I came across this sub which I have been reading through. I don't know if I can afford testing right now, but are there any things I could try in the meantime? 

I was thinking of trying the Seeking Health Hydroxo B12 with Folinic Acid supplement. My concerns are anxiety, insomnia, heart health, and supplementing a mostly-vegan diet. Or should I just stop all supplements entirely? I'm feeling so frazzled from the anxiety that has built up these past months and need to change something.

1hsc4ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/AAMasterRace/comments/1hsc4ug/2_batteries_exploded_not_sure_why/,2 Batteries Exploded - Not sure Why ,"I purchased a pack of Panasonic EVOLTA rechargeable AA batteries , and put 2 of them into my Energizer charger. Battery ( A ) and battery ( B ) .This charger had been in a draw for some years , and I don't remember when the last time I used it. I plugged the charger into a wall socket in my lounge , and left the charger running with both batteries . I was in my bedroom when about an hour later I heard a very loud bang.  The charger that had been plugged into the mains wall socket had fallen onto the floor , and one of the batteries ( A )  was still in the charger, but the second battery ( B ) was missing. I placed the charger on a table , and physically removed the battery ( A ) , from the charger ,and that battery felt hot to the touch, but this battery still looked intact .

The removed battery ( A ) was placed alone on a table along with the charger . The charger terminals look damaged.  I eventually found the other missing battery ( B ) on the floor in the lounge. This battery ( B ) looks like it had exploded as one of the end caps was missing, and the wall in my lounge where the battery ( B ) has struck, was covered in a fine black duct. 

  
So I then took both the batteries ( A ) + ( B ) into my bedroom along with the charger and placed them on a table . I then went to make a cup of coffee, while I was making the coffee, I heard another loud bang, but this time it came from the bedroom.

When I went into the bedroom I noticed that the intact battery ( A ) had exploded by its self, and one of its end caps was now missing. 

So ...

  
Old charger used 

Two new  Panasonic EVOLTA rechargeable batteries exploded.

Was the explosion due to the old charger , or possibly due to fake Panasonic EVOLTA rechargeable batteries . I have tested the voltage on remaining new Panasonic EVOLTA rechargeable batteries, and the voltage was correct .

Any thoughts please.

My MIL has a habit of storing stale food in the fridge (not freezer) for months. She claims this is done only when travelling but it isn't true. Multiple times when I have sent curries over to her place in the past she tells me she consumed  them 3 weeks later. She has herself said that she has kept the following in the fridge during the mentioned duration below:

1. Rasam - 2 months
2. Idly 1 month . Her solution if they become hard - Put water on the idlis, microwave and they will be soft again.
3. Dosa batter - 1 to 2 months. If the batter becomes sour, add sooji and continue use. Add sooji again if it turns sour.
4. Non-vegetarian and Vegetarian curries - 3 months.

The rice she uses for the batter is infested with weevils and so is the flour. Even though they aren't harmful to health, it shows how unhygienic the kitchen is. Her solution is to freeze the flour and then use a sieve to separate the weevils. They do come again because there are so many eggs in the flour and rice is not kept in proper storage containers.  She also has expired packets of poha, coffee powder and other dry ingredients that she continues to use even though the date has passed 2 years ago.

She tells me off for using frozen fish in my curries even though it is consumed within 2 days. My choice of using frozen fish is because of the poor quality and hygiene standards at our local wet market. However, she freely uses frozen chicken and prawns in her curries. I'm also working full time, and when I told her I meal prep curry base and keep it in the freezer for emergencies for a few days, she said that is unhealthy and I will cause cancer to her son.

I now have a 7 month+ baby and she is starting solids. My MIL lives 5 minutes away and no option for us to move farther. My husband has been brought up like this and it is only now that he has become aware of how stale the food can really be at her place. When I speak with multiple people in front of him, he understands better. Now he is willing to speak to his mom, but I am hoping to gather more opinions so that I feel validated.",2,1735872199.0,IndianFood,0,1.0,False

She’s less than halfway through with college and I’m working on getting a full time position in my field. We’ve always been close but at one point when she was in high school she stopped speaking to me fairly abruptly, I mean we hung out after school really often. Suddenly she was snapping at me when our parents made us come to family gatherings. Otherwise she ignored me. One day she just started hanging out with me again, but it was very awkward. She was 16 around this time and I was just in college. My friends said she might just be realizing our age difference. But I asked my sister what I did wrong and how can I fix it. 

She said she doesn’t wish to talk about it. But it was something I needed to hash out… I let it go despite feeling like I had no answers. Through the years she said my mom talked poorly about me which caused these emotions. Other times she said her friends, or most recently she said she doesn’t remember what it was. This set the stage for our current relationship. 

I often ask her to spend time with me like we can get some coffee or do an outing for fun, even take a walk. She’ll go, but she sets a timer for 30 min and then she needs to be home. She says she feels guilty bc she has so much stuff to do but she doesn’t do any of it (her words) so doing something with me takes away from me. She always reminds me „when the semester starts I can’t hang out,, but I also have school and work so I feel this is a given? The way she says it is almost like reprimanding a child. When we are home and I’m in the living room my parents ask me to leave, because my sister sighs and gives me a look. She will not speak to me at home, she’ll scroll on her phone, play video games, hang out with my parents. But she does not talk to me unless she deems our 30 minute timer can begin. And if we hang out earlier… like say we cook earlier, we can’t talk later.

This is pretty new. When she’s was younger she wouldn’t put these rules. I don’t want to drown her but the 30 minute timers are excessive to me or not talking. If I’m in the same shared space as her she gets mad and storms out. But she’ll talk to my parents and brother no problem. She’s previously mentioned she’s bored and wants a boyfriend again, or friends. But when I suggest activities she doesn’t budge… but my grandparents scold me for not inviting her when I’m out with friends. Since I’ve tried so much what’s the point anymore? Lastly it feels like we compete. If I have a YouTube channel my family compliments, she needs to have one too. If I do x she must do x better than me ",0,1735872113.0,RedditForGrownups,3,0.5,False

For a bit of context as this is my first proper post about this I'd like to welcome every one to Steve who is my sleep paralysis thing yes I did name him and yes I did assume and assign him a gender...

Me and Steve have been unfortunately stuck together for years for as long as I can rember idk why or how he came or even why he's decided to stay I live a relatively boring life cozier up in bed drinking coffee and watching films so I'm assuming he gets no fun out of watching me sleep although ik he could find my sleep talking amusing sometimes....

Anyway to the point usually Steve stands about a foot away from the bottom of my bed near my books which I've never had an issue with usually he points to the books , stares at the floor and occasionally he use to look at me then the floor repeatedly I'm not religious however i believe in certain bits about the after life so I've always taken that as a going to a bad place sign ... and I've never let it bother me however tonight as I write this I am for the first time scared of Steve.... usually I see Steve just as I'm abt 2 pass out so I always say goodnight to him and I did the same tonight.. However I think somethings aggravated him because tonight when I went to sleep I lay down and got comfy did my goodnight and went to sleep had a normal dream which I can still recall vividly for ppl interested in silence to do with dreams ... however I woke up not even half an hour later to hear someone walking in my room (I do however share my room ) so I imagined it was just my sister walking to her bed but it wasn't after it all happened within a second i sat up to see her in bed asleep so ik it was Steve that did this ....

But as i woke from my measles 30 minutes of sleep I heard the walking next to my bed along side the faint plastic sound as there's a small bag next to my bed ... Steve never got this close so I thought maybe he does this when I complrlty asleep to make sure I'm OK but I knew something was wrong when I couldn't move my legs anything above my ankle couldn't move which is highly unusual for me usually I can move and walk abou while seeing Steve but still I was pinned to the bed my Steve it felt weird and I felt powerless  that's when I felt a large heavy body lay onttop of me one are over mine the torso leaning onto mine and the head trying to bury its self in my neck ..  which is bizarre as only one person does that with me when I sleep and that person is currently hours away and Steve being yhe only one to know that it just confirms that tonight was Steve.... Steve lay onto of me like that for what felt like ages until I felt his hand slip between my waist and the mattress then he started moving his hand up to clarify to the readers I'm female with obvious features that show that I'm female so as you can imagine Steve moving his hand up my body made me feel very uncomftable at this point I wanted him to leave so when I tried to fight back and move him I was only faced with a tingling  pain from my paralysis 

Eventually i  realised I could move my feet and build my movement up from there the second I could move I sat up to make sure it was not Steve if it was a person I wanted them to get caught red handed but when there was no one there Ik it was Steve and Steve wasn't anywhere to be seen when I sat up still half asleep 

So please reddit I'm asking for your help why the sudden change ? Why so forward even after he knows my past ? Why me ? Why tonight ? And mostly how do I get rid of him for good ??",1,1735872016.0,SleepParalysisStories,0,1.0,False

I'm a 21-year-old man (57kg) and I've been getting very little sleep for the past 6 days, only 1 to 2 hours per night.

As usual, I go to bed around 11 p.m., except that I seem to be stuck in a state of semi-sleep, and in the end I end up waking up completely. I only manage to fall asleep around.
I've started to feel very hot for no reason, even though it's 18.5 degrees in my room. My hands quickly become clammy, I sometimes feel a wave of heat around my face, and sometimes I end up with sweat on my ankles and chest/neck.

I don't think it's the fault of my clothes + bedding, as the problem disappears in the morning when I'm almost ""cold"".

I don't drink anything exciting (tea, coffee), I eat light and 3 hours before going to bed, I'm no more stressed than usual. In general, my habits haven't changed at all. 
I had a thyroid blood test for other health problems (IBS) and everything was normal.

I would like to know if anyone knows what could be the cause of my ailment, and if I should go directly to a GP or wait to see how it evolves. ",1,1735871966.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1hsbzuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1hsbzuy/starting_this_journey/,Starting this journey,"I've been overweight since I was a preteen, and it's always been a struggle to lose weight. Diets always fail me as I can't stick to them long-term even if I have positive results short-term as they typically just aren't realistic for me/my family to sustain.


For the past 12 years I had hit a plateau, fluxuating between 175 to 177 pounds at every annual checkup at the doctors. While still much too heavy for my short stature of 4'11"", no adverse health concerns/issues had come up and I'd been pretty comfortable with my bigger size. 


At my annual checkup this year however, I had gained 40 pounds from my last checkup, and am the heaviest/biggest I have ever been. For the last month, I've felt things getting harder to do, and I'm getting winded easier. Playing with the kids is exhausting, and going for our 1-mile hikes now hurts. I'm lacking energy, and know it's more than just my age (almost 40). I mentioned weight loss to my doctor and asked for a nutritionist referral, but because I'm miraculously somehow not pre-diabetic and have no verifiable health issues related to weight, my insurance plan doesn't cover it. So she just stated ""portion size matters"" while showing me a plate larger than I ever use and asking if I want to consider bariatric surgery. I do not want to consider surgery at this point, but am not opposed in the future if my health dictates such. She also informed me that I wouldn't qualify for any medications as I'm not pre-diabetic, despite me being one of the only members of my family who is not diabetic. My mom, dad, siblings, grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles ALL have type 2 diabetes.  I'm actually shocked I don't and am not even pre-diabetic. I am starting to develop high blood pressure, but not yet high enough to be on medication.  I didn't ask for meds, but she made sure to inform me not to ask until/unless I developed health problems. 


So, it's time for a change to feel good again. I'm not going to regularly watch the scale as I make changes, as I am looking for non-scale victories, and know that not seeing the number change makes me want to give up far too easily. I work a high-stress emotionally heavy job, and don't want to add to my mental load with a number. I do not have a set goal weight, my goal is to hike that mile without being in pain at the end, and to have my clothing fit correctly without being snug (I have not upsized my clothing through the gain, but have noticed them being much more snug than I find comfortable). I plan to weigh myself quarterly to track scale progress, but not to put my successes into that number itself. 


I've re-downloaded MyFitnessPal, and am tracking everything I consume. I've not had a soda in almost a week, which is a big change for me (two 20oz bottles of Pepsi daily for years).  I bought a Cirkul and am using GoSip cartridges to avoid migraines from caffeine withdrawal, and to have flavor since I've not found a bottled water I like the taste of and don't  like our tap water. I took a sip of my husband's Code Red Mt Dew earlier and it was so sweet I felt sick - when it used to be one of my faves. I feel like that is a small victory when unhealthy drinks taste too sweet. I quit drinking soda once before, and remember the 12 pound in a month weight loss. Then I got pregnant and quit trying to lose weight, and succumbed to my Pepsi craving. 


I've also stopped using creamer in my morning coffee opting for just sweet n low for now, with plans to cut down how many packets I use gradually until I can just drink black coffee. I've changed from whole milk to 2%, and will gradually move to skim. I know these are only small changes, but they don't feel too big to sustain long-term and hopefully several small changes can add up to a big positive change in health over time. 


The one single time I was able to have a nutritionist visit was a free but required visit for a lower rate on my employers health insurance plan. The advice they gave was that it is much easier to stick to adding or replace something than it is to take something away, and then do it every day until it is a habit. Add an extra glass of water before bed and when first waking up. Start 10 minutes of exercise once a day until it's a habit, then add more minutes/strenuous activity when it feels easy. Still have mashed potatoes and gravy, but cut down the scoop size. Don't cut out anything completely unless finding a suitable healthier alternative you can stick with, but change how often or the portion size instead, and add something else (have your chocolate, but add eating a vegetable before eating the chocolate. Have your fried chicken for dinner, but add drinking a whole glass of water before eating it for some examples they gave) I think this is probably pretty decent advice that I'll start taking. 


This weekend we are putting together an elliptical, since I know I will never actually make a trip to a physical gym. But I can watch a show in the evening and use the elliptical intermittently while I do. Some movement is better than none, and I will eventually build up how long of a spurt I do on it while watching TV and waiting for the dishwasher or laundry to finish. 


Questions I have for those of you much further into your journey: 


Does  it matter when I exercise? Would it be better in the morning before work, when getting home from work, or an hour after dinner before bed? I'm not even sure it matters when I do it, as long as I do it. What was easiest to incorporate into your day? 


Are there ready-to-eat or microwave options I can easily add/replace my lunches with that are only 300-400 calories that will leave me satisfied until 6pm dinner? I have a nut allergy and several broken teeth so any nut-safe easier to chew protein options will be highly appreciated! Everything I come up with is mostly dairy with little to no protein. I also am terrible at meal planning/prepping and frequently forget my lunch at home during the week, so things I can leave in the office fridge or in my desk would be very helpful - and will help cut down how often I door dash unhealthy lunches. 


I typically don't eat breakfast, and just have 2-3 cups of coffee. I'm not hungry til around 11am, nearly lunch time. Is it true that I'm causing my body to think it's ""starving"" by not eating breakfast so it hoards all energy sources (fat)? I don't intentionally fast, I'm just not hungry until lunch! 


I am open to and welcoming of any free resources that you have found to be most helpful to your journey!

Near as I can tell, Teddy seems to be afraid of anything on TV, and not necessarily the sounds on the TV. (I've tried watching TV with the sound muted/off and he still is scared.) When the TV is on, he shakes, pants, and drools a little. Teddy is on fluoxetine now, but it doesn't seem to be helping after 3 mos, so I've made a vet appointment to try something else.

Does anybody have some suggestions on things I can try to help Teddy become less terrified of the TV? (He already has a ThunderShirt and a calming collar, too.)

I think of the ones I tried. I loved The Season of Ghosts, The Phenomena of Witchcraft, and The Flame of the Bear most...!

**The Season of Ghosts** (*bergamot, frankincense, rose geranium, ginger, lemongrass, and blood orange*) Opens with the candies that lived in grandmother's crystal dishes - the confectionary citrus sweetness of pillowy circus peanuts and tangy jellied oranges glowing like stained glass. But it's the turn it takes, the transformation that haunts: a slow bloom of golden musty glamour that hints at powder puffs and hat veils, of the musky, mossy, bronze grandeur of those perfumes that filled rooms with their presence and lingered for days in fur coats. It's finding faded sepia-tinted photos in an ornate old candy tin of your grandmother from that unmistakable era, each image radiating the warmth of a moment when time moved slower, and youth seems older than our own age now, more weighted with substance and shadow.

**Midnight Marzipan** (*a ground almond snowpack glistening under a chilly scattering of sugar-bright stars, standing out against a night sky of the darkest cacao*) I braced myself for the marzipan in this one; I didn't even realize I did it, but when I finally smelled what was actually happening in the scent, I realized I had been holding my breath. Though I love marzipan --adore it!-- both in scent and taste, it can overwhelm with the high-pitched peal of sugary sweetness. What I got instead was the deep, full, resonant, sonorous richness of barely sweet, dark, dark chocolate. The marzipan was a soft, trilling frill, fluttering at the edges. A duet between Darth Vader and Megan Mullally, where the Dark Side of the Force becomes velvet cocoa-dusted truffles and somehow makes Karen Walker's signature giggle feel like sugared almond stardust on snow.

**Faunalia** (*a thick, starlit, unspoiled forest, with a burst of wild musk, opobalsamum, black bryony, mandragora, and hemlock*) Like opening a forgotten storybook, where the forest's scent rises between pages tinged with the echo of vanilla - not the sharp bite of pine or wet earth, but something once growing but softly bespelled, slumbering and subdued. The musks feel antique rather than wild, a soft sepia tone rather than vivid green. It's what you might smell if you pressed your nose to an illustration of dark woods in a Victorian fairy tale, where the ink itself carries old magic and time-worn pages hold the memory of primordial forest and ancient greenwoods.

**Poor Monkey** (*pink lotus root and fig milk with ylang ylang, bourbon vanilla, soft myrrh, fir, khus, and sandalwood incense*) Like preserves made from petals gathered too early for dew - a tender, translucent jelly that holds summer's sweetness suspended in light, the way an altar holds its morning offerings. Fresh figs split open like pale stars, lotus petals floating in milk-white bowls, and unburnt sticks of sandalwood waiting patiently - sweetness as a promise, like tomorrow's devotions already taking shape in the quiet hours before sunrise.

**Pomegranate Milk** The red sun races through winter-stained snow like Dracula's eyes in that final chase - all grenadine turned lurid and glowing with the day's dying light. Why does this perfume also remind me of Japanese candy discovered in the back of an import shop, that distinctive musty-sweet chalkiness? Perhaps it's the way time and context reshape sweetness into something stranger - in sunset's crimson hour or years on a forgotten shelf, what was once simple pleasure takes on an elegant decay.

**Porcelain Krampus** (*brown leather and a bundle of switches encased in pale white orris root and rice powder, translucent white musk, Himalayan ambrette seed, and milky vanilla*.) She sits pristine in tissue paper, this porcelain child with cool milky skin and frost-pale curls, radiating a sweetness both powder-pure and glazed smooth - like marshmallows dissolving in winter air, like sugared pears turned to frost on the windowsill. Though she glows with innocence, you know better. That's why her tiny severed hand lives in your pocket, wrapped in a handkerchief, small and impossibly perfect, still trailing that haunting whisper of confectioner's sugar and cold cream. You tell yourself it's for safe-keeping, and perhaps that's true in a sense,  but really, you're keeping yourself safe --from her gaze in the dark each night, as she watches you from high on her shelf, with a smile that's patient and sweet, and ever-so-slightly wrong.

**Hard Cider Cake** (*a thick, spongy white cake spiked with hard apple cider and frosted with whiskey-laden buttercream*) A possum-riding gnome rolls up in a car made of twigs and acorns. ""Get in, loser,"" they grin, ""we're having cider with the Green Man."" What they pour is fresh-pressed and unsweetened, with something unexpectedly verdant lurking in its depths - like drinking autumn sunshine filtered through new spring leaves. The old magics are simple ones: apples and leaves, earth and air, each sip tasting of secrets whispered between the roots of ancient trees

**A Cup of Tea in the Verandah** (*black tea and bergamot shimmer in the glow of sunlit amber as cypress boughs cast lingering shadows, the heart blooms softly with jasmine sambac and tender orris*) A single bloom emerges from craggy castle walls like a long-lost, long-gone friend impossibly appearing in morning light - its petals glowing rosy with the same translucent warmth as sunbeams through stained glass. The stone beneath holds secrets in its tea-stained shadows, cool and tannic as bitter centuries of words unsaid, feelings unreturned. Memory blooms here, unbearably delicate yet persistent and softly strangling as ivy, reaching through time toward a cup that was never filled.

**Phantom Team of Horses** (*a spectral cacophony of shimmering, translucent dun sandalwood, grey amber, and wraith-chilled chestnut galloping through the mist-cloaked shadows of time, a clattering of clove and black pepper, and a crack of phantom leather*) Through mist and gloaming, phantom hooves prowl and roam - a nutty-woody-resinous haunting that refuses to settle into silence. The wood whispers like morning fog, barely there; a subtle saltiness clings to the chestnut's echo, while grey amber broods beneath it all, murky as twilight in forgotten hollows. Like those ghostly horses that never quite reach their destination, these scents circle and hover, their spectral stampede more whisper than thunder, more shadow than storm.

**The Phenomena of Witchcraft** (*green balsam, bay leaf, fossilized amber, blackened vetiver, and clove bud cloaked in oud*) The morning after a midnight revel, musty clove smoke and primordial resins mingling in the morning's murk and morass. When witches trade their broomsticks for bar stools - all that wild green magic gone deliciously seedy, forest herbs trampled underfoot in an alley behind a dive bar, sacred incense mingling with spilled spirits. Like knocking thrice on heaven's door and getting an answer from somewhere decidedly south.

**Frau Holle** (*snow-covered pines, witches' herbs, bestial musk, flax, and ethereal flowers that represent both birth and death*) Sometimes, we run across a perfume that bears little resemblance to our expectations when it comes to its blueprint of notes. Such is the case with this atmosphere of bracing winter mint and bitter forest berries, scattered across the rapidly dissipating warmth of a recently vacated featherbed. The fog from the hearth is dusky and strange, like herb-steeped milk in an abandoned bowl.

**Lavender Kitchen Mouse** (*lavender cotton candy fur and vanilla popcorn balls, sent skittering out of the kitchen with a good-natured wave of our polished wood rolling pin*) For a popcorn devotee - nay, a popcorn zealot who would happily survive on nothing but perfectly popped kernels for the rest of time, dental floss bills be damned - there is nothing quite like that first hit of toasty corn. Whether it's movie theater butter pooling in the ridges, nutritional yeast giving it that umami funk, or simply sea salt bringing out corn's inherent sweetness (and let's be clear: adding caramel, or indeed any form of sweetness to popcorn, is an unforgivable crime against both nature and the pure pleasure of popped corn). But here's something entirely unexpected: that perfect salty-corny base sprinkled with lavender's crisp, herbaceous brightness. Like finding fresh sprigs tucked between kernels, adding an aromatic sharpness that cuts through the savory warmth. It's a weird combination and probably shouldn't work - much like how finding a beady-eyed little mouse nibbling in your popcorn bowl as you reach for another handful would be pretty jarring - but somehow, this odd little creature has charmed its way into my heart.

**Ube Sufganiyot** A soft swirl of fried dough, a scant sifting of powdered sugar, and a filling that melts all its elements - white chocolate, pistachio, and coconut - into one creamy, nutty reverie. Pair this with Lavender Kitchen Mouse above for the perfect snack box curation at an all-night Wes Anderson movie marathon, where every treat is just slightly offbeat and endearingly peculiar.

**Paysage** (*the pale moon pouring magic: Tunisian opium and mugwort with blackened bourbon vanilla, tuberose, glittering white musk, datura accord, wild plum, and tobacco absolute.*) In the bottle, I know exactly what this is: my mother-in-law's Jólakaka, all rum-soaked candied lemon peel and winter warmth. But on skin, it transforms into something far more mysterious - like a lemon icicle in one of those classic locked room mysteries where the detective finds nothing but an inexplicable puddle of water beside the body. Sharp and crystalline yet impossible to grasp, bright citrus frozen into a vanishing elegance, leaving you to question whether you really understood what you experienced at all.

**Eighteenth Lash** (*vanillekipferl plunked in a pile of pine needles*) Buttery, crumbly, melty cookies with a base of bitter, oily walnuts and a rich, caramelized shortbread bottom...baked in the steam and sap of an enchanted pine's resinous heart, they've taken on the deep forest's secrets - as if being born in the heart of an ancient conifer has imbued them with its balsamic soul. Wear this scent and imagine this treat while Chelsea Wolfe's haunting voice carries you far over misty mountains cold, where dark things sleep in hollow halls beneath the fells.

**The Human Double** (*a shadow-blackened fougere steeped in an uncanny, discomfiting lavender tar*) Imagine if lavender went sepulchral, if coumarin turned to ash, if oakmoss grew on graves - this is the shadow-self of a classic fougère. Though we don't know this one's building blocks, we know its intentions: the familiar herbal notes have been submerged in something black and viscous, like catching your reflection in a darkened window at midnight and watching it linger after you've walked away. Doppelgangers embody pure existential horror - they violate our most fundamental sense of uniqueness through their unheimlich theft of selfhood. This is what happens when your double claims your signature scent as its own, and worse, wears it with more authority than you ever did.

**Gently, Gently, They Are Timid** (*candied orange and pink peppercorn, sugared freesia petals, vanilla bean, and white hone*y) ""The weird the Spirit brings,"" as mentioned in the lyrics of this perfume's inspiration is jaunty and bright, and indeed spirited. This could be the signature scent of the most gleeful parlor ghost, whose enthusiasm for the spectral life is utterly contagious. The first manifestation brings bursts of rosy spice and diaphanous flower petals before settling into its true form: a tatted lace doily holding the memory of creamed toffees and sugared meringues, all grounded in something as smooth and refined as the cream in a proper lady's tea. The spirits probably attend her séances just to watch her elaborate table-floating mechanisms with fond amusement - they're happy to play along with a hostess who goes to such lengths to entertain them.

**Lavender Avocado Toast** (*a toasted slice from the middle of a springy, oaty loaf blessed with a rich green schmear and sprinkled with lemon juice and lavender sea salt*) This is not the avocado toast I was expecting - but rather a delicate, floral violet-tinged lavender jam mingling with thick, cultured salted butter of such distinct creamy richness, all melting into warm, crusty golden toast that's been dusted with what might be flower-infused sugar, might be fairy dust. This is what happens when your trendy café is secretly run by flower fairies who've decided to put their own enchanting spin on the brunch menu.

**The Flame of the Bear** (*fir resin, bayberry, myrrh, mistletoe, and oak bark*) When I smell The Flame of the Bear, memory catches in my throat like pine smoke: the same grandmother who brought out those crystal dishes of candy I mentioned in The Season of Ghosts had a bayberry candle whose scent is everything that Christmas is to me today, as an adult: a soft sweetness twined with delicate spice, the very essence of evergreen twilights and December promises. She would unwrap it from tissue paper with such care, as if it held more than just wax and scent - and of course it did. Some scents are time machines, and this one carries me back through winters past, when love could be captured in something as simple as candlelight and its reflection in her eyes. I can't smell this without seeing her light it, then reaching for my hand (so I wouldn't touch it!)

**Krampus Kreme Latte** (h*azelnuts, almonds, and coffee beans sweetened with heavy cream froth and honey and spiced with ginger, black pepper, black cardamom, and cacao.*) When I smelled this extremely robust coffee scent, I thought, ""woweee, this smells like spicy Krampus coffeeshop romantasy #booktok drama!""

KRAMPUS'S FORBIDDEN GRIND  #1 in Demon Romance  
(CW: coffee addiction, consensual soul bargaining)

When artisanal coffee roaster Peppers McGee\* accidentally summons Krampus with her darkest, most potent brew yet, she doesn't expect him to become her most demanding regular. The way he salaciously savors her honey-kissed foam and black pepper sprinkle makes her wonder if he's hunting for more than just the perfect cup. Between the scorching intensity of fresh-ground beans and the sweet heat of their growing attraction, Luna must decide: keep playing it safe with her usual roasts, or risk it all on a blend that could consume her completely.

1hsbv6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1hsbv6c/its_been_almost_a_year/,It’s been almost a year ,"She got upset we had our disagreement and she quit talking to me. There have been moments we reconnected for a bit but it’s never been the same. There have been glimpses of hope she wants to be friends again

She has at least one other good friend now. Because of the timing it kind of hurts sometimes because it was around the time we stopped talking so I feel she replaced me. But that’s silly and unhelpful for me to think though I do sometimes feel jealous because they are close and she says she loves her. In a way it gives me hope she can or will love me as I know I am just as kind and just as loving and can be a good friend just like her if given a chance, and I have my own unique personality and benefit only I can provide. I feel a year is plenty of time and space to forgive me. I apologized and expressed how I feel and how much she and our friendship means to me. I’ve tried to see things from her perspective. I’ve given her compliments and in the past small gifts. I offered to treat her for her birthday when things were good. More recently I have brought up things people and pictures that helped us connect and remember the past. I have given her my contact info just in case and suggested we hang out or get together perhaps for coffee when she is ready. I’ve told her little life updates about my day and asked about hers. I’ve encouraged her professional life and done my best to stay out of her personal life though I haven’t been perfect as it Ms been an area of dissent. I’ve complimented her about her internal and external beauty. I’ve told her I will always be there for her and love her unconditional and that there is no pressure for when/if she wants to talk. 

All of this with little in return. At one point in the beginning she had blocked me so idk if I’m blocked now but she has responded since then so my guess is no. A year is a long time and while things may not ever be the same I thought we would be further along in our friendship by now. Maybe she’s not ready? Maybe she doesn’t want to be friends again after all and changed her mind. Should I ask her? Is a year too long to wait? ",1,1735871558.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

## Securing Your PC: A Deep Dive into Smart PC Locker Pro

In today's interconnected world, protecting your digital assets is paramount.  A single security breach can lead to significant financial losses, identity theft, and irreparable damage to your reputation.  While comprehensive antivirus software forms a crucial part of your digital defense, it often falls short in preventing unauthorized physical access to your computer. This is where Smart PC Locker Pro steps in, offering a robust and versatile solution to lock down your PC and safeguard your sensitive data.

### Understanding Smart PC Locker Pro: More Than Just a Password

Smart PC Locker Pro, developed by NoVirusThanks, is a powerful application designed to comprehensively lock your computer, preventing unauthorized access to your files and system functions.  It's not just about a simple password lock; it's a multi-layered security system built to deter even the most determined intruders.  Think of it as a digital vault for your entire PC.

Unlike basic screen lock utilities, Smart PC Locker Pro offers several key advantages:

* **Unbreakable Password Protection:**  Secure your PC with a strong, custom password, ensuring only authorized users can unlock it.  The software's robust algorithm protects against brute-force attacks, making it highly resistant to unauthorized access.

* **Safe Mode Lockdown:**  Many security threats attempt to bypass standard security measures by booting into Safe Mode. Smart PC Locker Pro cleverly circumvents this tactic, effectively locking your PC even when in Safe Mode, both with and without networking capabilities. This proactive approach significantly enhances your overall security.

* **Critical Function Disabling:**  Smart PC Locker Pro disables key functions that could be exploited to bypass the lock. This includes disabling Task Manager (taskmgr.exe), preventing malicious users from terminating the security process itself.  WinKeys, CTRL+ALT+DEL, and CD-ROM access are also disabled, eliminating common methods of unauthorized entry. This layered approach makes cracking the system significantly more difficult.

* **Advanced Logging and Monitoring:**  The software meticulously logs all unsuccessful login attempts. This provides a valuable audit trail, allowing you to identify potential security breaches and take appropriate action.  This detailed logging is crucial for post-incident analysis and security improvements.

* **Highly Customizable:**  Smart PC Locker Pro allows you to personalize the lock screen with a custom wallpaper image, adding a touch of personalization while reinforcing security. You can also configure the software to automatically lock your PC after a specified period of inactivity, ensuring it's always protected when left unattended.  This flexible configuration allows you to tailor the software to your specific needs and workflow.


### Why Choose Smart PC Locker Pro Over Other PC Security Solutions?

While numerous PC security solutions exist, Smart PC Locker Pro distinguishes itself by focusing specifically on preventing unauthorized physical access.  This complements other security measures, such as antivirus software and firewalls, which primarily focus on online threats.  Consider the following:


* **Beyond Antivirus:** Antivirus software excels at detecting and removing malware, but it won't stop someone physically accessing your computer and stealing your data. Smart PC Locker Pro adds that crucial layer of physical security.  It's a powerful addition to, not a replacement for, your existing security suite.

* **Data Protection at its Core:** The primary function of Smart PC Locker Pro is to protect your sensitive data. Whether it's personal financial information, confidential business documents, or simply your cherished photos, this software ensures that unauthorized access is prevented.

* **Peace of Mind:** Knowing your PC is securely locked, even in situations beyond your immediate control, provides invaluable peace of mind. This is particularly crucial in shared workspaces, public places, or when stepping away from your computer for extended periods.


### Real-World Applications: Protecting Your Data in Various Scenarios

Smart PC Locker Pro isn't just a theoretical security solution; it's a practical tool with wide-ranging applications:

* **Remote Work Security:**  For businesses with remote employees, Smart PC Locker Pro offers a critical layer of security.  It ensures that company data remains protected even if an employee's laptop is lost or stolen. This is especially important when dealing with sensitive client information or proprietary business data.

* **Public Access Protection:**  Working in coffee shops, libraries, or other public spaces exposes your computer to potential theft. Smart PC Locker Pro provides an extra layer of protection, even if your laptop is stolen, preventing immediate access to your data.

* **Home User Security:**  Even at home, the risk of unauthorized access exists.  Whether it's curious family members, house guests, or potential burglars, Smart PC Locker Pro provides a reliable barrier to protect your personal files and information.


### Additional Security Measures and Best Practices

While Smart PC Locker Pro offers robust protection, combining it with other security best practices is crucial:

* **Strong Passwords:**  Use strong, unique passwords for your PC and all online accounts.  Avoid easily guessable passwords and consider using a password manager to securely store your credentials.

* **Regular Software Updates:**  Keep your operating system and all software applications up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities.

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Where available, enable MFA for all your online accounts to add an extra layer of security.

* **Data Backups:**  Regularly back up your important data to an external hard drive or cloud storage service to protect against data loss in case of theft or damage.


### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can Smart PC Locker Pro be bypassed?**

A: While no security system is completely unbreakable, Smart PC Locker Pro is designed to be highly resistant to unauthorized access.  The combination of password protection, critical function disabling, and Safe Mode lockdown makes it significantly more difficult to bypass than standard screen lock utilities.

**Q: Is Smart PC Locker Pro compatible with all Windows versions?**

A:  Please refer to the NoVirusThanks website for the most up-to-date compatibility information.

**Q: What happens if I forget my password?**

A:  NoVirusThanks provides detailed instructions on password recovery, though this process may vary depending on your chosen security settings.  It is crucial to remember your password, or have a secure method of retrieving it.

**Q: Does Smart PC Locker Pro slow down my computer?**

A: Smart PC Locker Pro is designed to be lightweight and efficient, minimizing any impact on your computer's performance.


### Conclusion:  Protecting Your Digital World Starts Here

In a world increasingly reliant on digital information, securing your PC is no longer a luxury; it's a necessity. Smart PC Locker Pro provides a powerful, versatile, and user-friendly solution to lock down your computer and protect your valuable data from unauthorized access.

We are relocating from Los Angeles to the Dallas area for work and are seeking advice on neighborhoods. We’re an interracial, childless couple (40F, 53M) with two dogs. I’ll be working from home, and my partner will be working in Irving Monday to Friday, 9-6. We’re ideally looking for a walkable neighborhood or one that’s a short drive to restaurants, bars, boutiques, coffee shops, farmers markets, and a great Pilates studio—within a 30-minute commute of Irving. We plan to rent for the first year to get a feel for the area and would prefer a single-family home or townhouse over an apartment. Any suggestions on areas to start our search?

1hsbtdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/showndtalks/comments/1hsbtdn/i_dont_like_being_single_yet_here_i_am/,I don't like being single. Yet here I am.,"You know, I’ve always had this strange relationship with being single. Honestly, *I don’t like it*. I’ll say it outright because, sure, being single *sounds* empowering—freedom, independence, all that jazz—but for me? It often feels like this weird, lonely silence when I really crave someone to share moments with. Like, I can’t count how many times a random Wednesday night has me curled up on the couch, microwave popcorn in hand, watching some sappy rom-com and thinking, *Why isn’t that my life right now?*

And I know, I *know*, people love to tell me to “enjoy the single season” or “love yourself first”—as if maybe I haven’t spent hours scrolling through solo self-care ideas or Googling “how to be happy without a relationship.” I mean, I get it. There’s wisdom in that—sure. Even Buddhism speaks to this idea of finding peace within yourself. There’s this teaching from Thich Nhat Hanh that says, “You must love in such a way that the person you love feels free.” Maybe that includes you, loving yourself enough to feel free to be single, but honestly? *Being free can suck*. Freedom gets boring when there’s no one co-piloting your life adventures, asking if you want to pull off the freeway for that random diner or reminding you to pack an umbrella.

I guess that’s what I miss the most—it’s not even the *big* stuff. It’s the mundane, everyday rhythm of a good relationship. Someone to text, “Hey, guess what happened today?” without overthinking whether I’m “bothering them.” Someone to remind me to breathe when I lose my keys or start spiraling into a tornado of existential angst. Emily Dickinson once wrote, “The soul selects her own society... Then shuts the door.” For a while, I thought that sounded so profound. But now? God, it sounds lonely. Who wants to shut the door on anyone who could make life feel truly shared?

I remember once reading in the Bible, Genesis 2:18 where God says, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.” That hits so deeply, doesn’t it? It’s not about having someone around just to stave off boredom or meet some superficial longing—it’s that *life was meant to be walked together.* Even spiritually, communities, families, love—these are supposed to be cornerstones of our existence. We need others. I need others.

But here’s the thing: society has this weird double message about relationships. On one hand, you’re bombarded by Instagram posts of couples with captions like “my everything” as if the single life isn’t worth flaunting. Then *boom!* Two seconds later, some TED Talk or Twitter thread tells you that staying single into your 30s or beyond is the “key to self-discovery.” It’s enough to make my head spin. Like, I do value self-discovery—of course I do! But I can also confidently say I just *really, truly, deeply want to not be single*. Is that so bad? Is it un-feminist? Am I too “needy”?

I don’t know. Maybe it’s because love feels baked into everything worth celebrating. Think about it—our greatest art, music, and stories are *all about love.* Shakespeare couldn’t stop writing about it! “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?”—people still read that 400 years later because it touches this universal need to feel worthy of someone else’s admiration, someone else’s consistent presence. Even philosophy dives into this yearning. Aristotle called humans “social animals,” and existentialists would say that at the core of all human hunger lies this desperate need for connection. I feel that so deeply. Sure, we were born alone and we’ll die alone—but between those two points? I *want someone beside me.*

What’s ironic is how sometimes people act like disliking being single equals desperation. Like, no—I’m not trying to stuff some random person into this gaping emotional void just so I feel better. I’ve been in bad relationships. Believe me, there’s nothing worse than that—I still remember being ghosted by someone I thought was “the one” and feeling more alone with them than I ever could be by myself. So it’s not about settling; it’s about believing I can find someone out there who clicks with me like puzzle pieces finally fitting together. Life’s messy, but it’s the kind of mess I want to clean up hand-in-hand with another person—someone who will say, “It’s okay, we’ll figure it out together.”

I don’t think there’s shame in craving connection. Even Rumi, the Persian poet and mystic, who’s all about transcending physical existence, said “The wound is the place where the light enters you.” Maybe singleness has been that wound for me—a place for wisdom to seep in. I’ve felt the weight of my solitude, sure. It’s taught me resilience, patience, maybe even some grace. But let me tell you, I’m ready for the light that enters in the form of love. After all, no one writes poetry about being alone forever—not the good kind, anyway.

# It’s Not Just About Romance—It’s About Belonging

You know what’s funny? When I say I don’t like being single, people always assume it’s because I’m desperate for a whirlwind romance or some Nicholas Sparks-level love story. And sure, romantic love is part of it. Who wouldn’t want that magnetic connection, the butterflies, and the deep intimacy? But for me, it’s almost more about feeling like I *belong*. Like I’ve found my person, the one who “gets” me without me having to explain everything in long paragraphs.

Human beings are wired for connection. Seriously, it’s literally built into us. Some researchers say that it's the evolutionary need for survival—like back in the caveman days, people *had* to stick together to avoid getting eaten or freezing to death. But now, that need for connection feels... *different*. You don’t need a partner to physically survive in today’s world (thank you, central heating, grocery delivery services, and Amazon Prime), but emotionally? It’s a whole different game. Cuddling up to my cat after a bad day will never—no matter how adorable she is—replace hearing another human whisper, “Hey, it’s gonna be okay, I’ve got you.”

Even Maslow’s hierarchy of needs speaks to this. Right above basic physical requirements like food and water is *love and belonging*. Friends help. Family helps. But isn’t there just something so specific, so tender, about being someone’s favorite person? About *knowing* someone else is choosing you, day after day, to share their world with? That’s the kind of belonging I crave—not in a dependent, clingy way, but in the “we’re building something together” kind of way.

One of my favorite writers, Maya Angelou, put it beautifully: “I belong to myself. I am very proud of that. I am also very proud that I belong to others and they belong to me.” That’s where it lands for me. It’s not just about independence or dependence—it’s about *interdependence*. It’s about sharing this wild, messy life with someone else who’ll laugh at my bad jokes, support my dreams, and remind me to eat something when I’m too busy to care for myself.

Now, society often paints this perfect picture of what that type of connection looks like. It’s always two attractive people, staring lovingly across a candlelit table, but *real belonging* doesn’t have to look that shiny. Sometimes it’s messy. Sometimes it’s just about sitting in silence on the couch, scrolling through your own phones but fully comfortable in the other’s presence. Sometimes it’s midnight talks about the meaning of life or quietly making coffee for each other on groggy Monday mornings. It’s simple, but it’s human. It’s everything I yearn for.

And isn’t that kind of connection a reflection of something bigger? They say love is the closest we can get to understanding the divine. I’m not sure if I totally understand that yet, but sometimes, being single just makes me feel... disconnected from the way life is supposed to flow. Maybe that’s what C.S. Lewis was hinting at when he said in *The Four Loves*: “To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken.” There’s fear in wanting love; I’ll admit that. But there’s also a kind of longing that feels like *truth*.

# Can We Talk About the Pressure to Be Okay With Singleness?

Here’s the irony: society tells me to love being single, to embrace it, to thrive on my own. Honestly? The pressure to love singleness feels *just as overwhelming* as the pressure to be in a picture-perfect relationship. I mean, have you ever picked up *any* self-help book in the last five years? They’re all filled with advice like, “You don’t need anyone else to complete you!” or “Being single is your superpower!” And sure, I get it in theory. Life shouldn’t revolve around romantic entanglements. I shouldn’t feel like less of a person because I don’t have a partner. But sometimes, this *relentless* emphasis on “independence” almost makes me feel... ashamed for wanting love. Like there’s something wrong with me for looking at happy couples and wishing I had someone to hold my hand too.

The truth is, independence and love don’t have to be opposites. They can, and *should*, coexist. Some of the healthiest relationships I’ve seen are between people who fiercely love and respect each other but also have their own hobbies, friends, and goals. It’s not about losing yourself to a relationship—it’s about *adding* to your life by sharing it with someone else.

But admitting you don’t like being single? It gets weird reactions. Sometimes it feels like saying, “I want a partner” is immediately interpreted as, “I’m incomplete without someone.” There’s this myth out there that emotionally healthy people don’t *long* for a relationship—but that’s just not true. Longing doesn’t equal weakness. It’s just... human.

Even ancient philosophers believed this—look at Plato’s *Symposium*. You know the story about soulmates, right? That humans were once these androgynous beings with two faces, four arms, and four legs until the gods split them in half, and now we spend our lives searching for our missing other half? That myth has stuck around because it speaks to something real. Maybe it’s not totally literal (thank goodness, because imagine the leg cramps), but the idea that we’re wired to find connection, to seek out love, feels so true.

So, hey, if you’ve ever been shamed for admitting that you want a partner... I get it. It’s hard to balance individuality with our natural desire for connection. But if I’ve learned one thing, it’s that wanting love doesn’t make you weak—it makes you *alive*.

I'm looking for a run club in downtown Toronto (i live nearby uoft main campus area) that trains somewhat competitively. I'm 28F and I'm used to structured training. Per week, my workouts used to look something this: Tuesday hills, Thursday threshold, Saturday morning speed, Sunday easy long long and post run coffee.

 I used to train like this with my previous run club in HAlifax but moving to Toronto most clubs only run for fun. Some paid clubs also only include 1 social workout per week, which is not really enough for me.

Any recommendations?

Additional information:  I loved the sense of community and I met great friends through structured training in my old club. We had this philosophy of running with mindfulness, helping each other succeed rather than compete against each other, practiced meditation techniques, drills to improve running technique, breathing techniques to calm anxiety before and after workouts. My coach, who taught me all of this, sadly died two years ago. He always coached without charging a penny.  He was very loved in the running community in Halifax.  I'd even be willing to start a free running club with this mindset because it was life changing for me and most likely I will not come across something like that. I feel lost without this.

I’m looking to bolster my network setup after experiencing some recent oddities. I currently use AT&T Fiber for both my home and business (a coffee shop/bistro) and am considering moving into the Ubiquiti ecosystem. I’ve been interested in Ubiquiti since my first job, where we used Dream Machines extensively in our racks (cybersecurity firm).

I now work from home as a DevOps engineer for a three-letter agency, so I want to ensure I’m investing in the right equipment to secure both my home and business networks.

From what I’ve read, it seems like AT&T Fiber doesn’t always play well with Ubiquiti switches. I was hoping for some advice on where to start. My plan involves running about 10 PoE cameras at my business and 6 at home. I’ve been looking at the Dream Machine Pro or SE, paired with a couple of Ubiquiti access points (recently ditched my TP-Link extenders).

Is this setup doable with AT&T Fiber, or are there better options I should consider? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

1hsbmg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1hsbmg6/clownitis_klownitis/,CLOWNITIS (Klown-I-Tis),"

Walking through his front door, Henry called for his mother. Eerie silence is all he got in response, so he slowly and mindfully closed the door believing her to be napping. Still, an uneasy feeling boiled in his stomach, especially with the outbreak of the disease known as “Clownitis” spreading wildly in an unpredictable pattern.

This disease turned ordinary people into twisted iterations of clowns. If contracted the disease would enact an over production of melanin causing large unnatural brown or black shapes to form on the face resembling clown makeup. People with darker complexions would instead suffer from a vitiligo like whitening of their skin, turning their complexion a stark white with patches of their original skin tone resembling clown makeup. Their eyes held malice and their teeth would somehow double in length and width stretching the lips into twitchy, involuntary smiles. They would laugh in an over the top, animated clown laugh and did so sporadically. In addition to the outer changes were the changes within. The ghastly grinners regressed into a feral state unlocking a primal predator instinct that enhanced their speed and stamina. The horrific jokers were great hunters, preying on animals and humans alike. While feasting on the flesh of their victims they would ask (no one in particular) “Does this meat taste funny to you?” Unsettling as all that may sound it only gets worse, should the victim somehow survive the ordeal then in a day’s time they too would become infected and change into a grotesque clown.

Knowing all this the nine year old cautiously moved deeper into the house trying to be as quiet as he could. Rounding the kitchen corner, his mind started to run wild with thoughts of his mother transformed and waiting for him with a knife. To his relief he was in the clear, but he did notice light brown hairs scattered around the kitchen floor and counter top. Sprinkles of crusted blood trailed from the counter, across the floor and leading into the dining area. His pulse quickened and he unknowingly held his breathe. As he inched his way to the dining room, he told himself internally to turn and runaway; yet he still moved forward.

Reaching the doorway he gently gripped the wood and slowly he took a peek inside. His mother was sitting at the table with her back to him enjoying a meal.

“Hi son!” she said. Aside from her hair looking greasy she seemed normal, nothing else was out of place. Henry replied with hi and he felt the tension leave his body in slow pulsating waves. Feeling confident that his mother was normal he asked her why there was hair in the kitchen and what the red drips were. To which she simply replied, “Does this meat taste funny to you?” The boys fear returned instantly and arose with a heat like a wildfire. His mother turned to face him, Henry’s adrenaline made her movements seem slow, revealing her “CLOWNSFORMATION.” The boy’s legs gave out at the sight. He couldn’t believe it, his mother had been “CLOWNSFORMED” into a card carrying member of the Insane Clown Posse.

Her lips stretched thin over her newly enlarged, blood stained teeth. So thin that her skin had split open in random spots to allow her to create the widest smile he’d ever witnessed. Looking at the table he saw the scraps of his guinea pig, looking back to his mother he saw one of the guinea pigs arms twitching in between two of her box like teeth. The boy’s primal instincts for survival propelled him to his feet and he made a mad dash for the front door, exiting the dining area the same way he came. His mother started laughing wildly and loud. Henry reached the door and unlocked it. As he turned the knob he heard the chair his mother sat upon smack hard on the tile floor. The boy turned to look and saw his mother exit the dining room rapidly through the other door then jump over the back of the couch in the front room followed by a midair front flip that cleared the front of the couch. She landed a perfect dismount on top of the coffee table in the front room breaking through it with bare feet. The broken and splintered wood digging, jabbing and embedding itself in the bottoms of her feet, in between her toes and under her toe nails. The tears of a clown flooded her eyes with the pain she felt showing the boy that the infected were not completely mindless, although he didn’t understand the significance.

Her upper and lower mandibles spread open wide and expelled more loud laughter. Then while using over exaggerated steps she began to mime her way out of an invisible knee high barrier. Henry swung the door open and ran outside, his mother giving chase. She was only two steps behind him when the boy made a sharp right toward the driveway. Her body continued moving forward although she turned her head to face him. She pivoted her body and quickly changed direction, running again toward the boy. Henry had crossed the driveway and his mother was three steps in to her new direction when the boy’s stepfather drove up unexpectedly, hitting the 5’ 2” woman at a speed of seven miles per hour.

The impact bounced the woman off the front of the vehicle, her body making a horn sound when the two collided. She flew up in the sky and crashed onto the trash bins in front of the house, knocking them over and spilling the smelly contents inside. Quickly hopping out of his car, Henry’s stepdad popped open the trunk and opened a pack of zip ties he had just purchased. The six foot, bearded man used them to restrain the unconscious mother to the trash bin handles then called 9-1-1 to report the emergency.

The two sat on the sidewalk waiting for the police and ambulance when Henry started sobbing uncontrollably. His stepfather tried to console him the best he could, saying that all would be fine and that she would be cured in no time. He said this but he said it not knowing if it was at all possible.

Henry’s story is only one of many stories telling the chaos and carnage of carnival freaks. A world increasing in madness and filling with deranged clowns daily.

Max hadn’t seen a single drink in 17 days. A personal record. His last bender had ended in disaster: broken glass, vomit on the carpet, his ex-girlfriend screaming over the phone about the endless phonecalls. This time, he had promised himself he would stay sober. 

The intrusive thoughts were bad, but the cravings were hell. Every morning, he lay in bed, shaking, all day he sat at his desk, shaking, at night, he lay in bed, shaking. And then there was the knocking.

It all started four nights ago. It started quiet at first, just a single, soft knock on the door of flat 4b. When he got out of bed to check, no one was there. 

Strange. You normally need to be buzzed in to get to any of the front doors. Has 3b long-hair left the latch unlocked again? Maybe 4a fish-smell? 5c hot blonde? 

On the second night, it grew louder. More frequent. Max dared not go to the door, paranoia was kicking in. Was this some sort of auditiory hallucination? Some part of the withdrawals that Sandra, his AA sponsor had warned him about? 

By the third night, it had grown even louder. The dull rapping echoed through the empty hallway, rattling Max’s nerves. He stayed up all night waiting for the door to swing open. Or waiting for it to stop and to find some release. He clutched the only thing that gave him any iota of strength - a coin from his AA sponsor, stamped with the serenity prayer and the words ‘One Day at a Time’. It had been her’s from when she had reached 10 years of sobriety.

Now it was the fourth night, and he couldn’t stop thinking about how much easier this would all be if he just had a drink. 

***…***

The knocking started at midnight. As it had every night. 

Max sat in his darkened living room, staring down the hallway at the locked, latched door. It came again, louder still - three definite knocks. 

“Who’s there?” Max’s voice cracked as his words echoed through the room. His throat tightened as the words left him. It was a stupid question—no one would answer. No one ever did.

He tried to ignore it once again, twirling his AA coin around his fingers, feeling the intricate embossings on the sterling piece. The sound grew louder and louder, the knocking became more impatient as the minutes rolled on - or had it been hours?

Max checked his phone.

***1:07am***

The sound hadn’t stopped for an entire hour. The knocks hammered against the door like an urgent heartbeat, each blow vibrating through the floor and sending tremors up Max’s spine. He clutched his head, squeezing his eyes shut, but the sound burrowed into his skull, relentless and inescapable.

Finally Max decided enough was enough. He grabbed his coin firmly in his left hand used his right to yank the door open, expecting to find some sort of prankster, or one of the many strange exhibitions of humans in the freak show that was his flat complex. 

No one was there.

He shut the door, heart racing. He stood behind the closed door for a minute or two, expecting the furious knocks to begin again. 

Silence. 

This confirmed it, it had to be a hallucination. 

As Max turned away from the door, a strange chill crept up his neck— the air had shifted. He shook his head, dismissing the thought. It was just the withdrawals messing with his head. Wasn’t it?

Max trod carefully through the flat. He could finally get some sleep. He entered his lounge, ready to switch off the lamp and get some rest, when his eyes picked up on a foreign object that hadn’t been there before. 

A bottle of whiskey sat unopened on his coffee table, next to an engraved trumbler his late mother had bought as an 18th birthday present. 

Max froze, his blood ran cold and he felt every individual hair stand up along his arms and neck. The bottle gleamed under the lamplight, the amber liquid inside glinting like a cruel invitation. Max’s head became overwhelmed with memories floding back: the warmth of the first sip, the sweet sting as it hit his throat, the way it silenced the chaos. His fingers twitched. He felt them aching, itching to unscrew the cap, but his mind screamed warnings. He had poured every bottle down the drain last month. How the hell was this one here?

“I threw you all out,” he muttered.

He grabbed the bottle, intending to pour it down the sink, but the moment he touched it, it felt as though it touched him back. A sudden freezing sensation shot through his arm.

“Drink.”

Max’s head jerked around, but the room was empty. He tried to release the bottle, but his hands were viced around it, unmoving. 

“No,” He muttered, his voice faltering. “I won’t”.

The bottle grew heavier in his hands. A low, guttural laughter echoed across the room. 

“You’ve already let me in,” the voice rumbled. “Why fight it now?”

“Fuck you!” Max screamed. He hurled the bottle with every ounce of defiance he had left. It shattered, the whiskey spilling like blood across the floor. The voice let out an ear-piercing howl, shaking the foundations of the flat. 

Max staggered back, cluthing the sides of his head as the walls seemed to start to pulse. He stumbled his way to the bathroom, readying himself to vomit. Just as he reached the bathroom sink, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. All of his pain was gone within an instant.

His reflection wasn’t his own.

The figure in the glass staring back at him was thinner, greyer and gaunt, with hollow holes where cheeks should be and black eyes. It’s mouth slowly stretched open into a wide smile. 

“You can never outrun me. I’m in every reflection you see, I’m every drink you crave, every moment of weakness. I will always be here.” it whispered.

Max staggered back, but his body didn’t move. His reflection refused to release him. The mimic stayed where it was, staring at him from the mirror as he screamed. 

“Go ahead,” it hissed at him. “Run, pray, pretend you’re stronger than me, but we both know it’s only a matter of time.”

***…***

The next morning, Sandra arrived at her usual time to check on Max. Her knock was unanswered. “As per fucking usual” She laughed to herself. She knocked once more, slightly heavier this time, but her fist pushed the door open. 

Sandra slowly cased the flat for any sign of Max. Nothing. Then she reached the bathroom. Inside she found Max curled up in the corner of the room, pale-faced, cluthing the coin she had gifted to him. 

“Max?” She whispered, crouching down beside him. 

He looked up, his eyes dark and bloodshot. 

“It doesn’t stop,” He said, his voice echoing defeat. “It’s always there, waiting for me to fuck up.”

Sandra wrapped her arms around him. “One day at a time, Max. We’ll face it, Max. Together. One fight, one breath, one day at a time”

She helped him up onto his feet, and guided him out of the bathroom, but as she started to leave, her gaze flicked to the mirror. For the briefest moment, she saw it - the twisted reflection staring back at her, it’s grin was razor sharp, its eyes widening. But it wasn’t Max’s, it was hers. 

It winked.

Sandra’s breath hitched. She took a step back, blinking hard, but the twisted grin lingered in the mirror—her grin. Her hand trembled as she turned away, her chest tight with a familiar, suffocating ache.

“Come on,” she whispered, her voice steady despite the chill in her chest. “Let’s get through today.”",4,1735870745.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

The city where I moved from had a couple of coffee shops that had attached greenhouses/plant stores. Those were my favorites because when I needed a break from work I could go look at plants and relax. Is there something like that in/near Providence? Or if not plants, something similar where you can go browse or look at cool things while taking a break?",0,1735870542.0,providence,10,0.5,False

So, the year’s come to a close, cuffing season is upon us and I’m still single, I feel like it’s time to finally change that. I’ve been looking on and off for about a year now and I’ve decided to give it one more shot and I’m going about it with a better mindset now I think.

I’ll get to the point, I aim to date to marry, I’d say I bring a lot to the table, and my ideal man would be someone who feels similar too. I think a relationship is best when we both bring equal value to the relationship, even if we aren’t necessarily equals in every way. I prefer a man who can lead, but not one who is abusive, or unnecessarily bossy. I want something real and healthy, just also traditional.

I’m religious, however you don’t have to be as long as you can respect that I am. I lean conservative, however I’m not rabid in my views and if you aren’t either. That shouldn’t be a problem either! 

Day to day you’ll find me in a gym, at my desk, in a coffee shop, on a hiking trail, with friends or, when I’m very lucky, in a swimming pool. I’m a pretty active and outdoorsy person, so if you’re a man who can pitch a tent, build a fire, chop wood (yum) we will definitely get on. I also love the gym, but if isn’t your idea of fun, that’s okay, just as long as you’re healthy and in good shape overall. I plan on living a long time, and I want a big family, so I want a man who I can do that with!

Physically, I’m not super picky, I’m short so most of you reading this will be much taller than me. Pretty much just be put together, hygienic and a decent weight for your height. I do love a nice beard and smile though. I’m blonde, athletic and I can clean up nicely and rock a nice dress when the occasion demands it, but day to day I’m either in gym clothes or comfy clothes. 

Touched on this earlier but I want a big family one day, ideally at least 3-5 kids (hopefully more tbh) so hopefully that’s your dream too. I have a stable career currently but after kids I’d probably prefer to stay home, it’s what my mom did for me, and I think it’s best for kids and everyone else as well. Kids need a consistent parent around. My dream is to move into the country somewhere, with a good school nearby, a good community and nature right at our doorstep. Think a modern homestead type of vibe.

So I think that’s all for now, hope this interests some of you! Send me a chat if so! ♥️",3,1735870512.0,ImpregPersonalsLTR,0,1.0,False
1hsbi9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1hsbi9r/first_timer_north_or_south/,First timer. North or South?,"I've already come to the conclusion that Italy is not just one or two trips. Ideally, I want to visit the entire country. That said - When I do visit for the first time this October for 3 weeks - I want to make sure I do it right. I'm not timid in crowds so If I happen to get stuck in heavy foot traffic, then I'll just have to go with the flow. Also, I will train my way through the country as it looks well designed. My initial plan was to get to Rome>Naples>maybe the Amalfi Coast if it makes sense. I learned today on YouTube University that I can fit Pompeii into that trip (is it worth getting the tour guide?) 

So, that is my plan. But, It occurred to me that Lavazza coffee was founded in Turin which took me on a deep dive the other day. This leads to potentially seeing the Northern/Central/Central Coastal part. Was looking at Turin > Milan (gf is drawn to the fashion scene in Milan) > & end in Venice. Is all of this out of touch with reality for a 3 week trip? I don't mind the madness of travel and big crowds, but I also don't want a nightmare experience (as much as I can manage!). It would be nice to see people's take on a first experience to Italy in the North or South in the fall. Still doing my research but I am excited for this Fall, already.

1hsbi0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1hsbi0c/artificial_intelligence_vs_artificial_cognition/,Artificial intelligence vs. artificial cognition.,"There’s a great deal of overlap between the two, but one thing I think more people need to be discussing is distinction between the two and how that impacts our development of AI. 

Intelligence is the capacity to reason, solve problems, and adapt to new situations, reflecting an overarching ability to process and apply information effectively. In contrast, cognition refers to the mental processes involved in activities like reasoning, decision-making, memory, and perception. While intelligence describes the broader potential for performing these tasks, cognition encompasses the specific mechanisms and operations that enable reasoning and decision-making to occur. Essentially, intelligence is the “ability to think,” while cognition is “how thinking happens.”

Basically, we risk overlooking some of the more fundamental aspects of how we think focusing primarily on intelligence. Things that are sometimes orthogonal to intelligence. Consider proprioception - we develop a sense of body position and movement before we’re even capable of reasoning in ways that can be verbalized, and this sense is central to performing rudimentary tasks that are difficult to mimic with machine learning. It’s something that’s so second nature that most people don’t even realize that it’s one of the senses.

It mostly just raises questions about how we’re going to accomplish what we’re hoping to do. Outright replacing a neurosurgeon is harder than people realize not because it’s hard to develop algorithms that reason the way we do, but because in a physical, rather than virtual, world we rely on other aspects of cognition to actually express that reasoning. Replicating the fine motor control necessary to make a cup of coffee, much less wield a scalpel is currently more challenging than everything we’ve done with LLMs thus far.

The question that comes to my mind is if we’re really looking at creating roles in the short and mid term as opposed to replacing people in roles. We don’t necessarily have to replicate the manner in which humans do things, it’ll be sufficient to build systems that can match (or exceed) the outcome. 

AGI is a different beast than automation because logical reasoning often takes on the role of a coach and/or commentator in general decision making. Think about the heavy lifting the brain is doing when you go about your day to day when it comes to say, maintaining a sense of spatial awareness and object permanence. It’ll be interesting to see how we implement these aspects of cognition as AI develops to not just think, but inhabit environments designed for humans.
