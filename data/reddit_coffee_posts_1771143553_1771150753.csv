✨ Flirt with filmy romance… from adorable coffee dates in London to intense rainy-night confessions under one umbrella 😏

Quick Vibes & Rules (so we all stay happy & respectful):

1. Keep it tasteful – light NSFW is totally fine (think lingering looks, soft touches, “almost” kisses, heartfelt hugs), but no explicit sex, nudity, or porn. Let’s keep the magic dreamy, not dirty.
2. Only classy & respectful content allowed – red-carpet moments, magazine editorials, movie stills, dance reels, aesthetic edits = yes! Overly revealing, heavily edited, or leaked/private pics = instant no.
3. Be kind & respectful to Alia and to each other. No body-shaming, no creepy behavior, no harassment. We adore her here.
4. Tag your posts properly: ➼ \[RP Search\] when looking for partners ➼ \[Open RP\] or \[Prompt\] when starting a story ➼ \[Pictures\], \[Edits\], or \[Appreciation\] for gorgeous content
5. Not strictly 18+, but mature/flirty vibes are very common. If light spice isn’t your thing, just scroll sweetly!

So come on, introduce yourself in the comments, Angels! Tell us:  
🔥 Your all-time favorite Alia look or movie role

1r5b33g,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1r5b33g/i_keep_telling_myself_and_her_that_i_have_stopped/,I keep telling myself and her that I have stopped expecting anything to happen...,"(M26) So for context our bedroom has been dead for over a year now. We had a long distance relationship when she (F27) moved away for a couple of years to seek higher education, and the last time we tried anything was now a year and a month when she would come home for the major holidays.  
In that time the intention was I worked my then job, save up money and we look for a bigger place after her schooling... lost that job during the election year, unemployed for 8 months aside from door dash and a part time referee. Have since gotten a job, and so has she. Opposite shifts.

In that time since she's been back, at first I was trying to be vocal about my wants/needs because my love language is physical affection. Most I would get is kisses and friendly snuggle before bed. I also understand I was not a very good partner in regards of being handsy. When we had a coffee date at around the 4 month mark, and me seeking therapy. I backed off. A lot.

She tells me she wanted to rebuild our emotional connection before we did anything physical. But then every night I would hear her with her toy in the other room. We started doing more coffee dates as a way to have a neutral place to discuss the hard topics (because having other people around us seemed to keep us civil) and I expressed my frustration about feeling undesired and unpursued. And hearing her use her toy EVERY night just kept making me think... ""What's even the point in trying if she preferred her toys over me."" and started to emotionally shut down. I was being short. I'd get snippy. And any playful teasing or banter (that's what started our relationship) I was doing equally back to her (she doesn't like that). So she tells me she only uses them to help her fall asleep. She's stressed at not getting a job in her degree, a lot of family drama and not feeling secure in our relationship. Which I understand 100% that for women its a mental state as well, and if their not in the mood their not in the mood.

But then it was the small comments here and there of ""I woke up this morning and I was horny but you were asleep."" or ""I had a dream we were partaking. It was hot."" So I got my expectations up... and I brought it up casually, then immediately pummeled because it was the statements like ""is that all you see me as, just something to stick your dick in?"" or ""is that all you think about.""

I snapped.

Around the 8 month mark to the date of our last bedroom escapade... I yelled at her after she pushed me to far. I don't yell. I hate raising my voice to the point it makes me shake. I've gone to therapy because I could not advocate for myself. To peacefully express my wants and needs. To compromise because at that point I am feeling unloved and frankly... just not wanted. We both cried, had a heavy conversation. She asked when was the last time. And when I told her its been a year... she didn't believe me at first... then realized I was right. I told her through my tears I've given up. I was mentally and physically checked out. I felt like I was not her partner. I was just a glorified roommate that snuggled and kissed her. If I couldn't approach her with my needs/wants to be more physical than snuggling... I was done. I was done fighting. Done trying. If she wanted me, she will be the one to pursue me because at this point... I saw NO progress when I tried for the 3 times in the past 5 months. No pressure, no expectations of anything happening, just me trying to ask. And she told me she didn't feel good in her own skin. She didn't feel sexy or desirable (I hate when she talks down about herself like that). And if I try to make GENUINE compliments meant to reassure I loved her for her... it made her more upset. It was a very long conversation.

We've done small things since... but nothing further.  
Because like I mentioned... I stopped expecting anything. Because If i got my hopes up, either I ruined it by being to expectant, or was disappointed and dejected.

So today, after a few months of trying to emotionally connect, we had a very good heart to heart conversation, had fun all day together, and genuinely enjoyed our company. She made a comment that I misunderstood. Late in the night as she was settling for bed, I got frustrated. I fucked up and made a comment. That I was disappointed nothing was going to happen. Words were exchanged, I got very upset at her for comments that FELT directed at me along the lines that just because it was valentines day I should not have expected her to put out. and I just stormed out of the room saying the one thing I've only said one other time. ""Fine. Now you've made me really mad. Have a goodnight. Roommate."" after which I did turn back to apologize. We fought again, because what she thought was a good night I ruined. I kept telling her, I was not expecting anything. I got mad because I thought we've been reconnecting these past couple of months. I was expecting something because of X comment you made at time. (I guess I misheard her because it was actually a Y comment.)

It's very hard for me to NOT think I am just this pushy asshole. She will tell me she knows I'm not trying to do anything or trying to make her feel slighted by me. but that roommate comment she's very upset about because If we had just snuggled for the night, instead I made it about me and how I was upset.

I understand... I have the worst timing.

I told her before, I didn't want to bring up why I felt disappointed. But she kept pushing me to tell her and I warned her that what I was going to say was going to make her upset. Eventually I told her and low and behold of course she got upset.

And she'll tell me I have the right to be frustrated and upset. But so did she if I kept pushing her. I get so frustrated when she says that because we BOTH know I have been nothing but patient aside from the rare (Over 30-45 days) times I would bring it up

I'm just sick of not feeling pursued. I'm sick of feeling like ""Oh yea, your frustrations and needs are valid."" Of course I know they are valid. But if nothing happens, where does that leave me?

I'm even being a book so open I tell her a new chapter immediately. I've been getting pursued by a co-worker. I am not reciprocating. I just let her know I'm already spoken for.

Because I want to make our relationship work. I want us to go back to when we pursued one another or at least MADE AN ATTEMPT.

I'm sorry for venting. I'll likely delete this when I'm not as dejected and upset than the normal. I just.... I hate feeling like there is nothing on her end towards me. There is... but its never the right time it feels like... or I'm the afterthought. I also acknowledge I left ALOT of context out.... But even I couldn't try to make it right.

I just want to feel more than the small ember I rarely get. I want to feel burned in a blaze... because this... Is not making me feel good inside... everything inside hurts... and I just want to make this work for both of us...

I am the asshole. At least... I think i am... but even now I'm questioning if I am fully...

Again... I'm sorry for my rant...",1,1771150185.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

I remember him having to use a shower that's just a bucket nailed to a tree. His aunt also makes him coffee but he doesn't drink it, just feels the warmth of the mug.

Have you had someone genuinely ask how you are? Not as an opener to a conversation. But just to ask. And care about the answer. And listen to it.

Life can become background noise and pleasantries. Actually maybe not even the latter.

This may or may not be your first rodeo. You may not even possess a ten gallon hat, boots, or a big belt buckle. But you might.

You might not have a silly and sarcastic sense of humour. But you might.

You might not love conversation, on endless topics. But you might.

You might not have a thing for British guys, for quirky, nerdy guys, for flirty, passionate guys. But you might.

You might not crave spark, connection, rekindling a fire within. But you might.

You might not need coffee dates (virtual or otherwise), messages, emails, voice notes, and chat (and more depending on geography). But you might.

You might not agree that the 70s produced the best movies. But you might.

You might not be feeling that stirring, those raised eyebrows à la Roger Moore, as you read this. But you might.

You might not need that cacophony of fun and friendly and flirty. But you might.

[#1],"*He could feel the smoke being pressed out of his lungs, but when he sat upright nobody was there. There was a blaze where his childhood home once stood, and two shadowy figures in the centre of it. Their eyes glowed red, then they lunged forward with shark-like fangs and a blood-curdling scream.*

Peter Parker bolted upright in a cold sweat, heaving so fast he felt his lungs would give up. He looked around the dilapidated Yancy Street apartment to find his friends asleep. He counted them off from left to right: Otto Octavius, Herman Schultz, Aaron Davis, Alex Horne, and Felicia Hardy. They slowly stirred awake some hours later to find breakfast — store-bought hotcakes and coffee — in the middle of their sleeping circle, as well as a note reminding them to go to work.

It had been nearly twenty years to the day, the day that Peter’s life changed. His parents, Benjamin and Maybelle Parker, were killed in what authorities ruled to be a kitchen fire, with a young Peter being placed in the system. He escaped with several orphans, and they formed a small clique known as the Streetside Six. They attended school in the day and did odd jobs at night, occasionally pickpocketing anybody nearby to scrap together enough for their school fees. Now the Streetside Six were adults, with their own lives and jobs, yet they never left each other behind.

Otto was an engineer, designing blueprints for medical equipment hoping that one of his ideas, just one, would help the Six break big. Herman was a sound engineer working for Mystery O, one of New York City’s most popular underdog film studios to date. Alex was a bouncer at the Cherokee Club in nearby Broome. Aaron was a martial artist who specialised in judo, running his own studio near Grand Central. Felicia was the troublemaker, the one who daughter herself, and the Six, how and who to pickpocket so they could survive. Peter…he had a different story.

Joseph “Hammerhead” Martello was one of the city’s most famous, if not its most ruthless, crime lords. He had also been walking down the street with his entourage when Peter, looking for a job, noticed someone approaching with a gun. He instinctively tackled the mobster to the ground while Joseph’s men, searching the perimeter for Peter’s suspected accomplices, discovered the assassin, a member of Joseph’s hated rivals, the Queens’ Tigers. Owing kindness, the Hammerhead gave Peter a cozy office job handling numerous financial accounts for his crime family, the “Maggia”. That was two years ago.

Peter arrived late, having been held up at the convenience store down the curb when two muggers stole money from the register. When he checked the accounts, his spine ran cold: that same store was recently placed under Maggia protection and was due to pay the month’s fees that same night. If they couldn’t gather the funds, the whole place would be smashed up, and the owner attacked. He kept to himself all day, watching as Martello’s men wandered in and out of the office. He somehow managed to identify who would be handling debt collection tonight, and was excused from work early as Joseph’s personal reward for his hard work.

Night came almost too quickly, and the Maggia enforcers — two high school dropouts named Brock and Cletus Cassidy — arrived at the store demanding the protection fee of two and a half thousand dollars. The owner tried to explain what had happened, but they didn’t care. Cletus was about to strike when a hand clamped down on his shoulder, sending him flying through the window as shards rained onto the asphalt. Eddie tried to land a punch, but his fist cracked in the assailant’s huge, gloved palm. Instead, a blurry fist landed square on his nose, forcing him to crumple before he crawled out of the store, picking Cletus up as he turned tail.

The owner, having hidden beneath the counter, saw his protector: six feet and between five to eight inches of mass, draped in a dark blue athletic t-shirt which compressed against his body. Over it, a crimson-red hoodie worn thin at the elbows, with a zip that looked old enough to shatter at any second. His face was covered by a red stretch fabric with cheap safety goggles clearly bought from a nearby hardware store. The figure glanced at the shopkeeper and said nothing, instead leaping out the window and sprinting down the road.

Back at Maggia headquarters, Joseph Martello was furiously downing glasses of brandy before hurling the empty bottle at the wall, watching the shards spray into Eddie and Cletus’s faces. They dared not move, lest their pain incurred more wrath. He had them leave the office; they didn’t make it far before they were shot in the head by his personal assistant, Robbie “Tombstone” Robertson. Joseph simply gave a flick of the wrist, and Robbie smirked. The order had been given.",1,1771149223.0,WhatIfMarvel,0,1.0,False

1r5aqce,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r5aqce,What is soulmate? Great video by Dr. K,"Honestly, I’m starting to think the apps aren’t even the real problem. It’s just that our lives have become these tiny, repetitive loops.
You know how it goes—same commute, same three friends, same coffee spot. We treat people like content now. We sit there scrolling and judging strangers from the safety of our couch, but we rarely actually put ourselves in rooms where a real, messy connection can just... happen.
We’re so obsessed with being 'compatible' and staying safe. But if I’m being real, the people I’ve actually fallen for in the past? They weren’t the ones who made sense on paper. They were the ones who surprised me.
If you asked me right now to describe my 'perfect' person, I honestly couldn’t do it. I’d just be guessing.
It feels like we’re obsessing over finding the 'perfect' burger—analyzing the bun, the sauce, the ratios—when we’ve literally never tasted a burger in our lives. How would we even know what 'perfect' tastes like if we’ve never just taken a bite?
So maybe we aren’t picking the wrong people. Maybe we’re just judging them before we’ve ever given ourselves a chance to feel anything.
If love is supposed to be risky and uncertain... where exactly are we supposed to find that anymore? Because it’s definitely not in an algorithm.

hi please help me what to do

Context: 4 months live in kami ni bf both working, his work is mid shift, while mine is morning shift diff company; 11mos in a relationship

nung feb 13 after opening the flowers sent by my bf, i noticed he left his extra phone, I got curious and tried opening it… I really dont know what to expect bec wala naman ako hinala sa bf ko before, na curious lang talaga ako because sabi nya that phone is for games only. so i tried lang na hulaan yung pw then voila, na-open ko… Una kong nakita yung messenger, so wala naman ako nakita except messages from friends and family. but when I opened the archived messages, dun na ako nanlumo.. I saw messages to 2 girls na nilalandi nya, si girl 1 inaaya nya mag coffee, or lumabas kahit saglit after shift ni girl, si girl ay same company ni bf. parang same, format nung he was chatting me when were just getting to know each other, then si girl 2 looks like matagal na nya kilala kesyo 7 years na daw sya nag aantay and parang ang tagal na nya inaantay yung oo ni girl, at kahit anong effort nya di nya mapasagot si girl… may mga chat pa sya na “can I call you? kahit saglit… etc. These are all recent convos lang, around jan 20, then yung mga latest chat is around feb 4 but i noticed na hindi na nagrereply yung mga girls. ang dami kong questions , naalala ko tuloy when he was courting me, and chatting me, may kasabay din kaya ako na chinachat nya, and it just so happens ako yung kumagat??

Sobrang sakit mga teata, parang biglang hindi ko na kilala yung bf ko, ang alam ko lang he’s very maalaga sakin, lagi ako pinagluluto ng baon, very caring and protective of me, binibigay nya lahat ng gusto ko he even introduced me to his family and that I am the first woman na pinakilala nya, now. Para akong binuhusan ng malamig na tubig, na para bang hindi totoo tong relationship namin. both naman namin napagusapan na date to marry kami. sabi pa nya sakin before jokingly na sakin palang ang gastos na pano pa sya mambababae.

i don’t know what to do. tinry ko magparining sa kanya about cheating cheating pero parang wala lang sa kanya

then kahapon, i tried checking his phone again, tapos wala na yung convo with 2 girls sa archive, deleted na.

sobrang hirap magpanggap kahapon knowing na nagsisinungaling sya,

mahal na mahal ko po ang bf ko, he is my person for 11 months and that 11 months was a bliss.

sobrang wala akong masabi sa kanya, but with this side of him. hindi ko na alam

now i dont know if i should let him know na alam ko na, or what, i have screenshots of the convos. 

Helpp anong gagawin ko, dami ko nababasa here na ganito and di ko akalain na magagawa din sakin ng bf ko, sobrang iyak ako ng iyak",3,1771148850.0,adviceph,12,0.8,False

I was nervous about it for some reason, even though I'm playing with trusted friends, and I've wanted to bring them this world and story for a long time.  We were down 2 of our 5 players, but everyone agreed to play anyway, and I've got a ""reason"" in game for characters not being there established since almost all of us are emergency workers with bizarre schedules.  So down 2, and it only being the second session, what I had planned was low stakes.  But they loved it!  The story could have gone a few ways.  They chose to investigate the missing woman a patron had posted to the job board (a physical corkboard in my kitchen that I make them handwritten things on coffee-aged paper).  So they investigate points of interest,  had to ride through a hags bog, fought some alligators, and eventually came to the meeting with the patron empty handed.    During a smoke break they had told me the bog scene was scary, with the lighting, music/sounds, and the little fog machine I had rigged up greatly adding to my narrating.  What I wasn't expecting, was the end.  The patron that had posted the bill was an old man, that the barbarian knew.  He guided him to the grave of the patron's late wife, and explained that they had done this a few times before.  Our rogue had picked some lavender earlier and gave them to the man to leave on the grave, and our cleric said some words about how even with his memory fading, the man's love for his wife never waned (the cleric got a DM inspiration for that speech.)  and they escorted the man home to his son whom was worried sick about his dad.  I was worried that I was going overboard and laying it on too thick, but when the session ended and I brought the lights up, all three players, my wife, the preacherman, and our doomsday prepper buddy... were all in tears.  I've never felt more aknowledged in my life!

1r5anmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1r5anmr/second_timers_prevdisney_decisions_decisions/,"Second Timers (prev.Disney), Decisions decisions!","Posting to see if anyone can advise on narrowing down options for our next trip. 

Us: Couple, late 30s-early 40s, not heavy drinkers but like a cocktail, big foodies, not into nightlife, love books, nature, experiencing new cultures. We have been on one cruise - Disney Treasure which was meant to be Virgin Islands but we ended up in Mexico and double-Castaway due to a hurricane. We love vacations generally. We love Disney World, we love long road trips seeing many different local areas and museums/architecture, local food. We love Italy. 

What we loved on 1st cruise: castaway days - absolutely loved swimming off the adult beach, Enchante and Palo, top deck food, food market, Haunted Mansion bar, room service, coffee bars, drawing classes, bingo, the shows, the casual vibes, the ship tours, fish extenders and pixie dusting, relaxing out on our verandah reading and soaking up the sun, sea days. 

What we didn’t like: rotational dining (we thought the quality of food was pretty bad so this was a big negative for us), high-pressure servers (“give us five stars on the survey or our families will suffer!”), lack of public quiet areas. 

We have a transatlantic booked on the Fantasy for this year despite our issues with the food - we hear embarking from Europe the food is a bit different plus the ship has sandwiches.😁 We are prepared to ditch rotational dining if it still sucks after trying 2/3 times. We are equally happy with a burger! We adored sea days and the TA is such good value. Don’t care so much s out the ports but we haven’t done them before so will go explore. Despite loving the Treasure we think Fantasy will be a better fit in terms of layout and adult spaces. 

Query: currently looking to book 2027. Might be a ‘may not be able to vacation for a while so want to do something awesome’ trip. Torn between some locations and whether to try a different cruise line. Currently looking at either Alaska with Princess (we thought Holland looked rather clinical and not many verandah cabins left which is a must, we feel, though we like the idea of the art classes and lectures) and combine with either some time in Canada or Disneyland (never done DL) depending; Norwegian fjords with either Princess, P&O or Cunard (but I’d love to chase northern lights in deepest darkest Finland sometime so wonder if this is a waste); transatlantic opposite direction with Disney and tacking on some DW or Disneyland Paris. 

Really struggling to figure out which cruise line may work well for us if not Disney. Disney for Alaska is expensive compared to others and doesn’t do Glacier Bay, and we think how other cruises do dining may suit us better if we go for Alaska. However, we wonder if we fall in the cracks - we don’t want a party boat but we aren’t interested in too much formality or stuffiness (we don’t mind the occasional formal night for fine dining), and we have zero interest in non-Disney musicals, dancing, singers and magicians etc. Partner thinks Alaska for the scenery wow factor but I run cold and think I will miss the sun and swimming too much. Open to other suggestions we have not considered (Hawaii for example), and we are open to embarkation from any U.S. or European/UK port. 

Budget up to around $8-10k all in. Up to 21 days but sweet spot is 10-14.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

1r5ahh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/1r5ahh6/is_there_gold_in_this_rock/,"""Is there gold in this rock?""","A little less than a year ago I was staying in a hotel in a medium size city that was in a typically safe-ish area (as in, I could walk around by myself and generally feel fairly confident I wasn't going to get mugged or whatever). Down the street was a coffee shop that was open late that I would go to often during my stay there, since it was like a three minute walk away. I would usually go before sundown, but that day I had to finish a project I was working on, so I ended up going a little after the sun had set. 

The path there wasn't very well lit, with only a few scattered dim street lights along the sidewalk, but it was such a short distance away that I wasn't worried at all. The walk there was fine, I got my chai quickly and started heading back. However, as I was walking up the hill back to the hotel, a man in a big black coat came out from behind a completely unlit area where the dumpsters were located by the side of the hotel and started approaching me. 

Obviously this raised about a million alarm bells, but it got so much worse when he started calling out to me asking me to stop. I turned my head and that's when I noticed he was carrying a rock about the size of a basketball. As soon as I looked back, he said, ""Come over here and look. Do you think this rock has gold in it?"" as he held it beneath one of the flickering street lights. 

I probably should've ran at that point, since the hotel entrance was only just a little ways up the hill, but I stopped and turned around. For some reason whenever something scary or unnerving happens to me, my first reaction is to get angry, not scared, so that's exactly what happened. He tried asking again, but I interrupted him and said no loudly. He tried to speak again, but I told him no again and told him to get lost. I stared him down a bit and he backed off, then slunk away. I stood watching him until he disappeared back behind the dumpsters so he was far enough away where I could at least have a decent head start if he decided to come at me from the back and then I booked it the rest of the way back to the hotel.

I dunno what that dude's plan was, but just the fact that he was hiding behind dumpsters in the complete dark and was trying to get me to look closely at a giant rock for ""gold"" was slightly unnerving. It's definitely not the worst encounter I've ever had, but it was so odd that it stands out amongst some of the others. ",3,1771147904.0,creepyencounters,5,0.8,False

I've been living with the Kompakt for a few months now and have discovered one of the pain points for me is simply navigating QR and Bar -codes. I'll be sent tickets, return slips, what have you, but without carrying around my email (happily, btw) or other apps I can't readily display them. I've been in the meantime sending myself QR codes to save them which has been somewhat clunky for me.

In addition to this, in real life one of the few times people prompt me to use a smartphone is to scan QR codes. Sometimes these are for ads or flyers that are being promoted, but sometimes they're just rather innocuous ways to cut down on paper, like for example a menu, or wait-list, or small online waiver for a local event. I don't necessarily mind that use of tech and so I've been looking for something that is seamless and works for my Kompakt using that same minimalist design language.

Enter: Calm QR

[https://github.com/jacobrmoss/calm-qr](https://github.com/jacobrmoss/calm-qr)

I have a signed release of the app there, ready to be added to your Kompakt. I would announce it in the official form as well but my account does not yet have the necessary permissions it appears (as my trustworthiness slowly rises in whatever internal system they use to decide I'm not a bot).

Enjoy. It's a simple app, but if it's any use to you I would of course appreciate a coffee (which is by no means mandatory).

Being shy doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. It’s actually a protective response your brain learned over time. But here's the truth no one's telling you: confidence isn’t a personality trait, it’s a skill set.  



Social media is flooded with quick hacks from influencers who confuse confidence with faking extroversion. It's not about “just be yourself” or “talk louder.” Real confidence is quieter. It’s built from understanding how your brain works, not pushing through anxiety every day like it’s a punishment.



After diving deep into books, behavioral science research, podcasts, and actually applying this stuff, these are the three steps that actually moved the needle.





1. Rewire your self-image first, not your behavior



People jump straight into public speaking or cold approaches, but that’s jumping ahead. The real shift starts internally.



\- Cognitive psychologist Dr. David Burns (from his book ""Feeling Good"") explains that social anxiety and shyness are usually maintained by distorted self-beliefs. Most shy people unconsciously label themselves: “I’m quiet,” “I’m awkward,” or “I’m boring.” Until those beliefs shift, behavior won’t stick.

\- Practical tip: Start saying what clinical psychologist Dr. Ellen Hendriksen (author of ""How to Be Yourself"") calls “gentle truths.” Instead of pushing affirmations, say things like: “It’s possible I can learn to enjoy social moments” or “I can be interesting in the right context.” These slowly rewire the brain’s threat response without triggering resistance.

\- In neuroscience terms, this targets your default mode network, your self-concept loop. When you soften it, social risks feel less threatening.





2. Build “exposure momentum,” not just “confidence reps”



Going from 0 to 100 socially is like going from couch to marathon. You’ll burn out and regress. What works better is sequencing your exposure like a workout program.



\- This is based on exposure therapy models used in clinical psychology, especially from the Center for the Treatment of Anxiety at UPenn. They emphasize graded exposure, gradually increasing difficulty while tracking your anxiety, not avoiding it.

\- Start with low-stakes reps: Comment on Reddit threads. Ask a stranger for the time. Order coffee with a deliberate pause in your speech. These give you “control wins.”

\- Log your exposures. Use a 0–10 anxiety score. Note: “I felt a 6 before asking,” and “Felt like a 2 after.” This tracks desensitization, says Dr. Judson Brewer (Brown University, neuroscience on anxiety loops).



This trains your brain to predict safety, not shame. That’s the real goal.





3. Build “status signals” through repeated micro-wins



Confidence grows fastest when others reflect it back to you. But that means you need to start broadcasting subtle signals people can respond to.



\- Psychologist Amy Cuddy’s research (TED talk, Harvard Business Review) shows that presence, being fully engaged in the moment, is more influential than trying to dominate. Start here before worrying about “charisma.”

\- Micro-step idea: Practice stillness when someone talks to you. No fidgeting, hold eye contact for 2 seconds longer than usual, and nod slowly. This signals calm status without saying a word.

\- According to MIT’s Human Dynamics Lab, 80% of interpersonal influence comes from nonverbal cues, tone, pace, eye contact, not content. So confidence is less about what you say and more about how you say anything.





These aren’t magic. But they’re doable. They replace “fake it till you make it” with actual rewiring. If you do these for just 3 weeks, you’ll notice your brain doesn’t freak out in social settings the same way.  



More people need to know that confidence is trained, not earned through trauma or talent.



Resources that helped build this roadmap:



\- ""How to Be Yourself"" by Dr. Ellen Hendriksen – best breakdown of social anxiety patterns  

\- The Huberman Lab Podcast (episodes on neuroplasticity and social fear)  

\- Dr. Judson Brewer’s book “Unwinding Anxiety” – incredible neuroscience-backed model to break anxious loops  

\- The Charisma Matrix (YouTube) – actually helpful for body language and voice tone work  



If you’ve been quiet your whole life, you’re not broken. You’re just untrained. Training starts now.

here's what nobody talks about: being fun isn't about being loud or cracking jokes every 5 seconds. it's about making other people feel good when they're around you. sounds simple but it's backed by actual research. dr. vanessa van edwards studied thousands of social interactions and found that the most magnetic people aren't necessarily the funniest, they're the ones who make others feel heard and energized.



after consuming way too much content on this (books, podcasts, youtube deep dives), i've figured out what actually separates boring people from fun ones. and no, you don't need to become an extrovert or develop a whole new personality.



the energy thing is real. this was the biggest revelation for me. fun people bring energy UP in a room. not manic energy, just... aliveness. they lean in when someone's talking. they react genuinely. they don't just wait for their turn to speak. there's this concept called ""energy management"" that improv comedians use, it's about matching someone's vibe then elevating it slightly. you can learn this. the improv book ""Yes, And"" by kelly leonard breaks this down beautifully. it won awards for a reason, the author ran second city's improv program for decades and basically wrote the manual on spontaneous connection. what blew my mind was how improv isn't about being funny, it's about making your scene partner look good. this translated directly to real conversations. when you stop trying to be interesting and start trying to be interested, everything changes. insanely good read that'll make you question everything you think you know about social skills.



storytelling beats joke telling every time. here's something most people get wrong, they think fun people are walking joke machines. nah. fun people tell stories with energy and detail. they paint pictures. there's actual neuroscience behind this, when you tell a story with sensory details, you activate the same brain regions in your listener that you experienced. it creates connection. malcolm gladwell talks about this in his podcast ""revisionist history"" where he breaks down why some stories stick and others don't. the secret? specificity. instead of ""we went to this crazy bar,"" it's ""we walked into this basement bar that smelled like old beer and cigarettes, and the bartender had this parrot that screamed every time someone ordered tequila."" see the difference?



playfulness is a skill you can develop. most adults have this beaten out of them by corporate culture and ""professionalism."" but playful people are magnetic. they don't take everything so seriously. they'll make weird observations, point out absurd things, suggest spontaneous plans. psychologist dr. stuart brown literally founded the national institute for play and spent his career proving that playfulness isn't just for kids, it's essential for human connection and creativity. his ted talk on this is wild. his book ""play"" should be required reading for anyone who feels stuck being the serious person in every situation. it's packed with research showing how play deprivation leads to depression and social isolation. the exercises in there for rediscovering your playful side actually work, i tried the ""serious nonsense"" technique where you treat mundane things with dramatic importance and it's ridiculous how much it loosens people up.



vulnerability beats performance. this one surprised me. the most fun people i know aren't trying to impress anyone. they'll admit when something went wrong, they'll laugh at themselves, they'll share slightly embarrassing stories. brené brown's research on vulnerability shows that people connect over shared struggles, not achievements. when you're willing to be a little bit messy and real, others feel permission to do the same. that's when conversations get actually interesting instead of just polite.



the reaction ratio matters more than you think. i started tracking this at social events (yeah i'm weird like that) and noticed something. fun people react visibly and genuinely to what others say. they go ""no WAY"" when someone shares something surprising. they laugh with their whole body. they ask follow up questions that show they were actually listening.



if the whole reading thing feels like too much work, there's this smart learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that turns all these books and research into personalized audio sessions. it pulls from psychology books, expert talks, and research papers on social skills and creates a learning plan tailored to your specific goal, like 'i'm naturally reserved and want to become more magnetic in social settings.' you can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with actual examples you can use. plus you can pick different voice styles, the sarcastic narrator actually makes the content way more entertaining. built by AI experts from Google, and honestly makes absorbing this stuff way less of a chore when you're commuting or at the gym.



become a collector of experiences, not things. fun people always have something to talk about because they're constantly trying new stuff. they took a pottery class last month. they went to that underground comedy show. they tried making thai food and burned the curry. doesn't have to be expensive or impressive, just different. dr. leaf van boven's research on experiential purchases shows that experiences make us happier than material goods partly because they give us better stories and social currency.



timing and pacing are everything. ever notice how some people can make a mediocre story hilarious while others bomb with good material? it's all delivery. comedians spend years perfecting this. watch any ali wong or john mulaney special and notice how they use pauses, how they build momentum, how they know exactly when to drop the punchline. the masterclass by steve martin on comedy is probably the best resource on this. he breaks down the architecture of humor in a way that applies to regular conversation too. you don't need to be a comedian, you just need to understand rhythm.



\*\*enthusiasm is contagious but it has to be genuine.\*\* people can smell fake energy from a mile away. but when you're actually excited about something, anything, that enthusiasm spreads. could be about your new coffee maker or a podcast you discovered or the fact that you finally figured out how to fold a fitted sheet. doesn't matter. genuine excitement about small things makes you more fun than fake excitement about ""cool"" things.



the cool thing is these aren't personality transplants, they're just habits. the more you practice bringing energy up, telling better stories, being playful, the more natural it becomes. your brain literally rewires itself through repetition, that whole neuroplasticity thing. start small. focus on one thing, maybe just work on your reactions this week. next week try telling one story with more detail and energy. you're not gonna become the most magnetic person overnight but you'll notice people leaning in more, laughing more, wanting to hang around you more.



and honestly? once you stop caring so much about being fun and just focus on making others feel good, that's when it actually happens.",2,1771146389.0,rSocialskillsAscend,0,1.0,False

*Back Roads & City Lights* is a modern-fantasy role-play set in Seattle, Washington, and the surrounding sprawl—from rain-slick downtown streets and neon-lit alleys to quiet coastal towns and the shadowed edges of the Cascades. On the surface, it’s coffee shops, tech start-ups, ferry rides, and traffic on I-5. Underneath, it’s Veil Accords, old blood pacts, and things with teeth and claws that never left when the world moved on. Vampires, werewolves, witches, hunters, and utterly mundane humans all move through the same city lights and back roads, working, loving, surviving… and trying very hard not to let the truth slip into the headlines.



The group focuses on character-driven, freeform storytelling: slice-of-life scenes, slow-burn drama, supernatural investigations, quiet horror, and the messy politics of keeping the secret in a city wired with cameras and social media. Want to play the exhausted FBI agent who keeps catching cases that don’t make sense, the bartender whose regulars include both wolves and cops, the occultist in a Capitol Hill walk-up who knows too much, or the hunter who’s starting to doubt the cause? There’s a rich, established lore foundation—werewolf packs, vampire societies, hunter cells, government departments, and more—but it’s built to give you hooks, not fences.



*Back Roads & City Lights* is a collaborative sandbox for players who enjoy long-term arcs, found family, and consequences that actually matter. Plots can be intimate or sprawling: a single rainy night in a Pioneer Square alley, a multi-thread investigation running from Belltown to the backwoods, or the slow unraveling of a character who realizes the world is nothing like they thought. If you’re looking for a grounded modern setting with room to tell your stories—where the supernatural is hidden but never passive—we’d be happy to have you pull off the highway, park under the flickering neon, and step into the dark with us.



* An 18+ Semi-Lit to Novella Modern Fantasy Role-Play.
* Deep World Lore thats always expanding and evolving.
* Multiple locations within the Puget Sound Area to play within. From the mist-filled forests of the Cascades, to the urban sprawl of the Seattle metro area

Devan's is ONLY GOOD because they are NOT SPECIALITY and offer cheaper rate and BT has commercialised to much that their roast has became SUPER INCONSISTENT (producer series and nanolot are exception if it wasnt obvious) 😐😐.

TL;DR : For the sake of god do not recommend roasters like BT or Devan's if they are looking to explore. Devan's is not speciality and nor they are good so do not recommend to others unless they are asking for economical options.

The student works hard, but she pretty clearly struggles with anxiety of some kind. In the past, this has meant that she's skipped conference social/networking events and doesn't ask questions during lab meetings or seminars. Recently, she and I had a meeting with our PI about her progress and upcoming scholarship application, and with every question he asked her, she began by first turning to me. At one point our PI misunderstood the goal of the work that she was proposing for her scholarship, and instead of correcting him, she kind of nodded along until I stepped in and asked her to clarify what she actually meant based on what we'd talked about.

English is not her first language, but that's the case for most of the lab, and she is normally very fluent, making me think this really is mainly anxiety and learned helplessness. Our PI can be...expressionless? And he has high standards. But he's not unkind or unfair, let alone abusive. I'm very sympathetic to feeling anxiety during one's PhD (and from a few things she's said, I suspect she shuts down a bit with male authority figures). But I feel that her inability to articulate or stand up for herself are turning into a real problem, and I'm not sure she appreciates just how much that's the case.

I've tried to encourage her to put herself out there, I've tried to encourage her to challenge herself to ask one question per lab meeting, my one on one meetings with her tend to take place informally over coffee to try to get her comfortable. I'm at a loss to know what else to do - I'm not a psychologist, and I have my own work to do (and this is also feeding into past frustrations I've had about younger female students wanting to see me as a protective mom figure). I think my student should be addressing her anxieties in therapy, but we honestly don't have much in the way of resources here. Our campus is isolated, and outside of that resources in English (let alone  my student's mother tongue) are limited. The one time I tried our campus wellbeing centre myself, the male counselor I was assigned went off on random tangents about his own anger issues, so I can't imagine that would be amazing for my student.

Good morning everyone,  
Today I’m posting a test I did for a project I’ll be undertaking soon. It involves contemporary artworks. I need to scan a series of cardboard masks (1 mm thick) cut and stapled together with metal clips applied with a stapler.

As I sometimes do, to optimize scanning time (in this case, I’ll have a couple of days), I’m doing some tests to check the set, positioning, and scanning methods. For this project, I built a replacement for these masks out of cardboard (coffee boxes) and stapled together with paper clips.

Below are images of the setup, scanning, and editing (all done with the new version of Revo Metro).

Amazing detail: a thin writing pressed (not printed) into the cardboard",1,1771145289.0,Revopoint,0,1.0,False

1r59rk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r59rk8/small_akward/,Small akward.,"2 months ago I started going to a coffee shop where Maria works. Originally I showed love interest in 1 of her colleagues but she wasn't interested.

Maria from the other hand started asking me questions like where I work or if I'm okay and she was laughing with my jokes.

I received her ""messages"" immediately and fortunately for me I was talking at the same time with 1 more person who works there, Nick.

One day I told him what was going on and if he could tell me Maria's last name so I could find her on social media and avoid possible rejection.

Nick told me that Maria doesn't see me romantically and she's like that with all the customers.

Days later Nick and Maria had a shift together and I went and talked to Nikos a little about unrelated topics Maria from the other hand was busy and I didn't talk to her (talk to Nikos with Maria present was possibly a big mistake I'll tell you later why).

After that Maria became formal to me and only greets me when I greet her.

Days later while I was going to the cafe I saw a picture that was a big let down for me : Maria sitting outside and smoking with atleast 7 guys (I said the obvious to myself and kept walking).

Inside the cafe I met Nikos again who karmically had a shift with her again. I told him that he was right all along and that she became formal with me. Nikos told me that Maria saw us talking together and suspected something and that's probably why she did that.

From then until last Monday I didn't talk to her at all.

Last Monday i went to the cafe and she was on shift alone, we said the typical and after a while I came back and told her to sit somewhere else because my neighbour stinks Maria became a bit sarcastic and said ""unlucky huh ?"" But i didn't replied and left.

Last Wednesday I was there as usual and happened to overhear a conversation between Maria and her boss.

Maria was telling him that she was studying to pass her driving test and was asking him for help (connections).

He replied ""I'll see what I can do"".

Thats the reason I'm posting here.

Βecause I can help Maria pass the exams, I have the connections.

I admit that I haven't completely written her off and I'd still like to f her.

How would you guys let her know that you can help her?

Write to me in the comments.

So far i have only 1 idea.

1. say it to her directly.

A bald move that i personally can't do.

Especially in our LGBT part which admittedly is harder to find, especially if you are a femme.

I saw a question on TikTok: “What if you are really waiting for something?”

It really hit me. What if we hope that God has something in store for us… but there really is none?

To be honest, I am running out of patience waiting. I think I have done almost everything, tried dating apps, joined FB groups / GCs, attended events, GTG, joined travel, went out alone, went to bars and had coffee outside hoping for an “organic encounter”

It really seems like nothing 😅

I also tried what they say “don’t look for it, it will come.”

So I took a break — almost 1 year:

no dating apps, no flirting, just focused on myself.

I was hoping that someone would suddenly come, like in movie scenes… but still nothing. I'm not in a hurry… but I feel like I'm losing hope haha. Every year, birthday, Christmas, New Year, Valentine's — still single.

I know that my family and friends are there (I'm super thankful), but it's still different when there's someone you always talk to, someone you say ""good morning,"" someone you share random thoughts with. You know that? 🥲

Sometimes I wonder:

am I really not meant for love life?

Am I just thirsty for affection?

I'm also really ugly, honestly.

I'm not completely inexperienced either. Since Grade 7, I've had MUs, situationships, flings, dates... my last one was in 2024. He offered a relationship but I declined because I wasn't ready since we only talked about Fubu.

Now that I feel ready... then no one comes 😅

It's just ironic.

Is that you? Have you ever felt this way?

At 2:23AM, the front door clicked shut.

I didn’t hear it open.

I didn’t hear it close.

I just heard the deadbolt slide into place.

I was behind the counter counting the till when it happened. The gas station was supposed to be 24 hours, but after midnight we locked the main entrance and only unlocked it manually for customers through the night window.

At least that’s how it was supposed to work.

I'm Fred. I’m 22 years old. I’d been working the night shift at that station for about six months. It sat off a two-lane highway outside town. No restaurants nearby. No houses within sight. Just pumps, asphalt, and dark fields stretching out on both sides.

From 1AM to 4AM, it was usually dead.

No foot traffic.

Maybe one trucker.

Maybe no one.

The front door wasn’t supposed to lock unless I turned the key from inside.

But I heard the bolt slide.

Clean. Mechanical.

Deliberate.

I looked up at the glass entrance.

The metal frame looked normal. The fluorescent lights reflected off it like always. The OPEN sign glowed red against the dark highway.

I stepped out from behind the counter slowly.

The store felt too quiet.

The refrigerators hummed along the back wall. The coffee machine clicked as it kept the pot warm. The security monitor above the cigarette rack showed the pump area outside. Empty.

I walked to the door and tried the handle.

It didn’t move.

Locked.

I reached for the key on my belt.

Still there.

Which meant I hadn’t turned it.

For a second I told myself maybe the door auto-locked. Maybe I had turned it earlier and forgotten.

But that didn’t sit right.

Because the shift before mine always left it unlocked until exactly midnight.

And I had let a customer in at 1:58AM.

I remember because he paid with exact change and counted it twice.

So the door had been unlocked after 2AM.

Now it wasn’t.

That was the first time I felt trapped in a place I was supposed to be controlling.

I walked back behind the counter and checked the security monitor that showed the inside entrance.

No one in the frame.

No one near the door.

The camera angle was wide enough to show the entire entryway.

Empty.

I rewound the feed thirty seconds.

The footage showed me at the counter.

Then, without anyone entering the frame, the door shifted slightly inward.

Just a fraction.

And then the bolt moved.

It looked like someone had turned the key from the outside.

Except no one was visible.

I watched it three times.

Same result.

No person.

Just the door locking.

My stomach tightened.

I stepped outside the camera’s field of view and looked through the narrow side window next to the entrance.

The parking lot was empty.

The pumps stood under the harsh canopy lights. Beyond that, darkness swallowed the fields.

No headlights on the highway.

No silhouette near the door.

I went back to the counter and called my manager.

Straight to voicemail.

I considered calling the police.

But what would I say?

“The door locked itself”?

That sounded stupid even in my own head.

I walked back to the entrance and pressed my ear lightly against the glass.

Nothing.

No breathing. No shifting gravel.

I tried the handle again.

Still locked.

I unlocked it from inside.

The bolt slid back smoothly.

I pulled the door open and stepped half a meter outside.

The night air felt cooler than usual. Heavy. Still.

I looked down at the lock.

There were no scratch marks. No sign of forced entry.

Just a normal lock.

I stepped back inside and closed it.

Left it unlocked.

I stood there watching it for a full minute.

Nothing happened.

I laughed once under my breath.

You’re tired, I told myself. You’ve been staring at fluorescent lights for eight hours.

I went back to the counter.

At 2:41AM, the bell above the door jingled.

I looked up automatically.

A man stood just inside the entrance.

Tall. Late 40s maybe. Dark jacket. Baseball cap pulled low.

I didn’t hear the door open.

I didn’t hear it unlock.

He was just there.

I glanced at the door.

Closed.

Unlocked.

I forced a normal tone.

“Evening.”

He didn’t respond.

He walked slowly toward the refrigerated drinks.

His movements felt measured. Not casual browsing. Just walking.

I checked the monitor.

It showed him entering.

The door opening.

The bell ringing.

Normal.

But I hadn’t heard it.

I told myself maybe the refrigerators had masked the sound.

He grabbed a bottle of water and approached the counter.

When he placed it down, his hand brushed mine.

His skin felt cold.

Not night-air cold.

Colder.

“You alone tonight?” he asked.

“Yeah.”

He nodded once.

He paid cash.

Exact change.

Didn’t take a receipt.

Before leaving, he looked past me toward the back hallway that led to the storage room and restroom.

“You should keep that locked,” he said.

“What?”

He tilted his head slightly toward the front door.

“From the outside.”

Then he walked out.

This time I clearly heard the bell.

Clearly heard the door shut.

I watched him through the window as he walked past the pumps.

No vehicle.

He kept walking toward the highway shoulder.

Then into darkness.

I checked the door.

Locked.

The bolt was slid into place.

I hadn’t touched it.

My key was still on my belt.

My hands felt numb.

I checked the monitor again.

The footage showed him exiting.

The door closing.

And then, as he walked away from frame, the bolt turning.

From the outside.

I rewound it twice.

There was no visible key in his hand.

No motion near the lock.

Just the metal shifting into place.

I stood there for several minutes staring at the screen.

The store felt smaller.

The aisles tighter.

The fluorescent hum louder.

At 3:12AM, I heard something from the back hallway.

A soft thud.

Like something being set down gently.

The storage room door at the end of the hall was slightly ajar.

I was certain I had closed it earlier.

I walked toward it slowly.

Each step echoed against the tile floor.

The air near the hallway felt warmer than the main store.

I don’t know why that detail bothered me so much.

I pushed the storage door open.

Nothing inside looked disturbed.

Boxes stacked neatly.

Inventory shelves untouched.

But the small metal push bar on the emergency exit at the back of the building was slightly depressed.

Like someone had tested it.

That door only opens outward.

And it triggers an alarm if fully pushed.

I pressed it gently.

The alarm screamed immediately.

So it was working.

Which meant if someone had opened it earlier, I would have heard it.

Unless they hadn’t opened it fully.

Unless they only tested it.

I stepped back into the main store.

The front door was still locked.

Bolt engaged.

I didn’t unlock it again.

I waited for sunrise.

At 5:47AM, my manager arrived.

I told him everything.

He checked the footage himself.

He didn’t say much.

Just rewound it several times.

Then he paused on the frame where the bolt slid into place behind the man.

“That’s weird,” he muttered.

That was it.

No explanation.

He didn’t accuse me of anything.

Didn’t joke about it.

Just weird.

I quit two weeks later.

They never fixed anything because there was nothing to fix.

The locks worked normally during the day.

The cameras never glitched again.

But sometimes, when I drive past that station late at night, I think about what the man said.

“You should keep that locked.”

From the outside.

And I still don’t know whether he was warning me.

Or reminding me.

STORY 2: “The Bathroom Key”

At 3:12AM, the bathroom key disappeared from the hook behind the counter.

I know exactly what time it was because I had just finished restocking cigarettes and glanced at the register clock.

3:12AM.

The key had been there five minutes earlier.

My name is Tara. I’m 26. I was working the overnight shift at a highway gas station just outside a small farming town. I took the job because night shifts paid slightly more, and I was saving up to move out of my apartment.

From midnight to 5AM, I worked alone.

The front door auto-locked at midnight. Customers had to knock, and I buzzed them in manually. After 1AM, most people just used the pumps and paid at the window.

The bathroom wasn’t public at night. If someone asked, I handed them a single brass key attached to a heavy plastic tag that said “RESTROOM” in faded black letters.

There was only one key.

It hung on a metal hook behind the counter.

At 3:12AM, the hook was empty.

I stared at it for a few seconds, convinced my eyes were just adjusting to the light.

The fluorescent bulbs above the counter hummed softly. The store smelled faintly like burnt coffee and cleaning solution.

The hook was still swinging slightly.

That detail made my stomach tighten.

Like it had just been lifted.

I stepped out from behind the counter and checked the register area.

No one in the store.

The security monitor above the counter showed four camera feeds.

Front entrance.

Pump area.

Aisle view.

Back hallway leading to the bathroom and storage room.

All empty.

I rewound the footage from the back hallway.

At 3:08AM, I could see myself walking out of frame after mopping near the coffee machine.

The key was visible behind the counter.

At 3:10AM, nothing.

At 3:11AM, still nothing.

At 3:12AM, the feed flickered for less than a second.

Not a full cut.

Just a slight distortion.

When the image stabilized, the hook was empty.

No one entered the frame.

No one stepped behind the counter.

The key was just gone.

I leaned closer to the monitor.

Maybe I had moved it earlier without remembering.

Maybe a customer had asked and I’d forgotten to log it.

But I hadn’t buzzed anyone in for over twenty minutes.

The door buzzer makes a sharp mechanical click. Impossible to miss.

I checked the front entrance camera.

The door was closed.

Locked.

No one outside.

I walked around the counter and checked the floor.

Nothing.

I crouched and looked under the cigarette shelves.

Nothing.

I opened the small drawer where we sometimes kept spare receipt paper.

No key.

That was the first time I felt watched in that store.

Not threatened.

Observed.

I walked slowly toward the back hallway.

The tile felt colder there.

The fluorescent light above the bathroom door flickered faintly.

The bathroom door was closed.

I tried the handle.

Locked.

From the outside.

Which meant the key was inside.

I stood there for a few seconds listening.

No sound of movement.

No running water.

No shifting.

I knocked lightly.

“Hello?”

No response.

I knocked again, louder.

Nothing.

The door didn’t move.

I stepped back and stared at it.

The only way to lock that bathroom was from the outside with the key.

There was no interior deadbolt.

If someone was inside, they would have had to take the key in with them.

Which meant someone had walked behind the counter to get it.

And I would have seen that.

Or heard it.

Or buzzed them in.

I told myself maybe I had left the bathroom unlocked earlier and just forgotten.

But I distinctly remembered locking it after cleaning.

I’m the kind of person who double-checks things.

That’s how you survive night shifts.

I went back to the counter and grabbed my phone.

I considered calling my manager.

But it was 3:20AM.

And what would I say?

“The key moved on its own”?

I went back to the hallway and pressed my ear against the bathroom door.

The metal felt cool.

I listened carefully.

At first, nothing.

Then, very faintly, I heard what sounded like breathing.

Slow.

Steady.

Close to the door.

I pulled back immediately.

My pulse jumped in my throat.

“Is someone in there?” I asked, louder this time.

Silence.

No response.

The breathing didn’t repeat.

I told myself it could have been the refrigeration units cycling.

Sound carries strangely at night.

I walked back to the monitor and rewound the back hallway camera again.

This time, I watched frame by frame.

At 3:12AM, just before the flicker, there was a shape near the hallway entrance.

Not fully formed.

Just a darker patch against the wall.

When the image stabilized, the bathroom door was slightly more closed than before.

Only by a few millimeters.

Small enough that I wouldn’t have noticed in real time.

But visible when comparing frames.

I felt a tightness in my chest.

I decided to test something.

I unlocked the front door and stepped outside.

The night air was still. No cars on the highway. No headlights in the distance.

I walked along the side of the building toward the bathroom’s exterior wall.

There was a small frosted window high up.

Too high to see through.

I stood beneath it and listened.

Nothing.

No movement.

No voices.

Just the faint hum of electrical wiring.

I went back inside and locked the front door.

The bathroom door was now slightly open.

Not wide.

Just a narrow crack.

The hallway light flickered once above it.

I stopped walking.

I knew it had been closed.

I was certain.

I stepped closer.

The air in the hallway felt warmer than the store.

Not dramatically.

Just noticeable.

I pushed the door open fully.

The bathroom was empty.

The sink was dry.

The trash can undisturbed.

But the brass key was sitting on the sink counter.

Placed neatly.

The heavy plastic tag facing upward.

I stood there staring at it.

There were no wet footprints.

No signs of anyone entering or leaving.

The stall door was open.

Empty.

I walked in slowly and picked up the key.

It felt warm.

Not hot.

Just warm.

Like it had been in someone’s hand.

I walked back to the counter and hung it on the hook.

It swung gently.

At 3:38AM, the front door buzzer sounded.

Sharp.

Mechanical.

I jumped.

A man stood outside the glass.

Mid-30s. Hoodie. Hands in pockets.

I unlocked the door.

He stepped in.

“Bathroom key?” he asked casually.

I stared at him.

“It’s out of order tonight,” I said.

He looked toward the back hallway.

For a second, I thought he might argue.

Instead, he nodded once.

“Probably for the best,” he said.

He bought a bottle of soda.

Paid cash.

Exact change.

As he walked out, he paused near the door.

“You should keep that locked,” he said quietly.

“Keep what locked?” I asked.

He didn’t answer.

He stepped outside.

The door shut.

The bolt slid into place.

From the outside.

I didn’t touch it.

I checked the monitor.

The footage showed him leaving.

Then the bolt turning.

By itself.

I quit a month later.

They replaced the bathroom lock the week after I left.

Said it had been sticking.

But I still remember how that key felt in my hand.

Warm.

And the way the hook behind the counter was still gently swaying when I first noticed it was gone.

Like someone had just stepped away.

STORY 3: “The Freezer Door”

At 4:02AM, the walk-in freezer door started shaking.

Not violently.

Not like someone was kicking it.

Just a slow, steady rattle. Like pressure building from the inside.

I was halfway through mopping the soda aisle when I heard it.

The freezer was in the back, past the storage shelves and employee restroom. Thick metal door. Heavy latch. You had to pull hard to open it.

My name is Marcus. I’m 31. I worked night shift at a 24 hour gas station off a state highway in rural Ohio. I took the job because it was steady. Graveyard shift meant fewer customers and fewer problems.

Most nights were predictable.

Truckers around midnight.

Drunk college kids at 1AM.

Dead quiet by 3.

At 4:02AM, there were no cars at the pumps.

No headlights on the highway.

The store cameras showed an empty parking lot.

And the freezer door was shaking.

I stood still, mop handle in my hand, listening.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. The ice machine near the soda fountain clicked once and went silent again.

The rattling continued.

Metal on metal.

A dull vibration.

Like someone on the other side testing the handle slowly.

The freezer was supposed to be empty.

We had stocked it around 11PM. I had physically walked inside. Checked inventory. Closed it myself.

No one had been back there since.

That was the first time I felt unsure about the layout of a building I worked in every night.

I walked toward the back hallway slowly.

The tile floor felt colder near the storage area.

The rattling stopped the moment I stepped into the hallway.

Silence.

I stood there staring at the freezer door.

It wasn’t moving anymore.

The latch was fully engaged.

The handle still.

I waited.

Ten seconds.

Twenty.

Nothing.

I told myself it was pressure change. Those freezers seal tight. Air pressure can make doors flex slightly.

That explanation felt logical enough.

But pressure doesn’t shake from the inside.

I stepped closer and pressed my palm lightly against the metal door.

Cold.

Solid.

No vibration.

I leaned down and checked the bottom seam.

No light leaking from inside.

I grabbed the handle.

For a second, I hesitated.

If someone was inside, opening it would be a mistake.

But that thought didn’t make sense.

No one could have gotten in without me seeing.

I pulled.

The seal broke with a sharp suction sound.

Cold air rolled out across the floor.

The freezer was empty.

Metal racks.

Stacked boxes.

No movement.

No person.

I stepped inside and looked around carefully.

The temperature hit instantly. My breath fogged in front of me.

Nothing out of place.

I stepped back out and closed the door firmly.

The latch clicked into place.

I stood there another full minute.

No movement.

I almost laughed at myself.

You’re tired, I thought. It’s just metal shifting.

I went back to the counter.

At 4:17AM, the freezer rattled again.

This time louder.

Three sharp shakes in quick succession.

Then stillness.

I didn’t move right away.

I watched the back hallway camera on the monitor above the register.

The freezer door was visible in the corner of the frame.

It didn’t move.

The image looked stable.

No shaking.

But I could still hear it.

Metal vibrating faintly.

That detail bothered me more than the sound itself.

The camera showed nothing.

But the sound continued.

I walked toward the hallway again.

The rattling stopped before I turned the corner.

The freezer door stood perfectly still.

The air near it felt colder than the rest of the store.

Noticeably colder.

Like cold air was leaking out.

But when I pressed my hand to the seam, it felt sealed.

I crouched and checked the latch.

Fully locked.

I stepped back.

Then I heard something else.

A dull thud.

From inside the freezer.

Not metal.

Not vibration.

More like something shifting weight.

I froze.

My pulse picked up.

“Hello?” I called out, my voice echoing slightly in the narrow hallway.

No response.

I pressed my ear gently against the metal door.

The cold bit into my skin.

At first, nothing.

Then, very faintly, I heard breathing.

Slow.

Steady.

Close.

I jerked back immediately.

My heart was pounding hard enough that I could hear it in my ears.

Breathing.

Inside the freezer.

That made no sense.

It was below freezing in there.

No one could survive inside that long without protection.

I told myself it had to be the refrigeration unit cycling.

Air compressors can mimic human patterns.

I stood there trying to match the sound to something mechanical.

The breathing didn’t repeat.

I grabbed the handle again.

This time, my hand hesitated longer.

If I opened it and someone rushed out, I had nowhere to go.

The hallway was narrow.

The emergency exit behind me required pushing a bar that triggered a loud alarm.

I pulled the handle.

The seal broke again.

Cold air spilled out.

The freezer was empty.

But one of the stacked boxes near the back wall had shifted slightly.

Not dramatically.

Just angled differently than before.

I was certain it had been flush against the wall earlier.

I stepped inside slowly.

The air stung my lungs.

I walked to the back corner.

The floor was dry.

No footprints in the thin frost along the metal grates.

I adjusted the box back into place.

When I turned around to leave, the door slammed shut.

Hard.

The metal echoed sharply inside the freezer.

For a second, I couldn’t breathe.

The latch hadn’t been engaged from the inside.

There was no internal lock.

Just a push bar to exit.

I rushed forward and hit the bar.

The door opened immediately.

No resistance.

I stepped back into the hallway, my chest tight.

The door slowly drifted inward again on its own.

Not slamming.

Just closing gently.

I stood there staring at it.

I hadn’t felt any draft.

No pressure shift.

Just a clean slam.

At 4:36AM, the front door buzzer went off.

I nearly jumped out of my skin.

A man stood outside the glass.

Heavy jacket. Work boots. Early 50s.

No vehicle at the pumps.

I unlocked the door.

He walked in calmly.

“Coffee still fresh?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I said.

My voice sounded thinner than normal.

He poured himself a cup.

Didn’t look at the coolers. Didn’t browse.

Just stood near the counter stirring sugar.

“You working alone?” he asked.

“Yeah.”

He nodded.

“You should keep that closed,” he said.

“Keep what closed?”

He tilted his head slightly toward the back hallway.

“The freezer.”

My stomach dropped.

“How did you know?” I asked.

He smiled faintly.

“Cold air carries.”

He paid cash.

Exact change.

When he walked out, I watched him through the glass.

No car.

He walked past the pumps and into the darkness beyond the highway shoulder.

I locked the door behind him.

This time, I made sure I turned the bolt myself.

I watched the back hallway camera until sunrise.

The freezer door didn’t move again.

But at 5:12AM, just before my shift ended, I checked the footage from earlier one last time.

At 4:02AM, when I first heard the rattling, the camera showed something I hadn’t noticed before.

The freezer door wasn’t shaking.

It was opening.

Just slightly.

Then closing again.

From the inside.

No one visible.

Just the handle dipping slowly.

As if someone had tested it.

1r59hgd,https://i.redd.it/3r7fqpewcmjg1.jpeg,HDFC MARRIOTT BONVOY - Redeemed my FNA at Westin Pune Koregaon Park - surprisingly great experience (Silver Elite),"Just wanted to share a recent stay experience in case it helps anyone planning to redeem a Free Night Award (FNA) in India.

Stayed at The Westin Pune Koregaon Park for a 1-night using an FNA (I’m only Silver Elite). Honestly went in with low expectations, but it turned out really nice.

What worked well:

• Called the hotel a day before arrival and politely asked if anything could be done for the occasion - they actually arranged complimentary breakfast for both of us even though Silver + FNA normally doesn’t include it.

• Spacious room with a great view, super comfortable beds (the Heavenly Bed hype is real).

• Nice small touches in the room - cookies, coffee setup, bottled water.

• Service felt warm without being over the top.

Things to know if you’re redeeming FNA:

• Nightly Upgrade Awards don’t apply on FNA bookings.

• Lounge was under refresh during my stay, but breakfast was given as goodwill.

• Asking politely (not demanding) really makes a difference.

Overall, felt more “premium and relaxing” compared to some Hyatt/Novotel stays I’ve done before.

If anyone’s considering redeeming an FNA in Pune, this property worked really well for a special occasion.",17,1771144155.0,CreditCardsIndia,1,0.85,False

I'm excited to introduce my second Vibe Coding service. I'd like to share how I built it and how I made it profitable!

First of all, I have about 10 years of experience in interface design and development in the industrial automation field.

This service allows you to simultaneously receive answers from three LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude) for a single question. I developed this service as a Chrome plugin because I wanted to cross-validate the information for more accurate results.

I used to use GPT, but with the advent of generative AI, I switched to Gemini. However, I sometimes missed answers from GPT, which made me wonder, ""Isn't there a way to use all three tools simultaneously?""

This service automatically translates messages into English when a user enters a message in the main chat window using their account, with the conclusion displayed in the first sentence for quick comparison. The split-window feature allows you to add custom slots and link other sites to your custom chat.

The business model is to provide basic functionality permanently for free and generate revenue by charging for features like ""Sponsors,"" ""the ability to expand windows to four,"" and ""adding custom slots.""

We used AntiGravity for development and LemonSqueegy for the payment system. While developing the MVP took about three days, adding features, improving the service, stabilizing it, and monetizing it through ""Sponsors"" took about 17 days. I'm still using the service, adding new features, and fixing bugs.

While I only earned 3.50 from the ""Coffee Sponsorship,"" I'm sharing this because it was a short-term success story. I plan to continue using Vibe Coding to quickly develop and monetize the services I use. Thank you for reading!

1r59ev7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r59ev7/partner_39m_blew_off_valentines_day_plans_and_i/,Partner (39M) blew off Valentines Day Plans - and I (39M) don't know how to respond.,"Hi All - I need some advice on how to handle some fresh Valentines drama, since I don’t have therapy until Monday. 

So my partner (M, 39) and I (M, 39) discussed how we’d like to celebrate Valentines Day, and landed on dinner at home, card and gift. I asked for clarity, because we’ve been together 5 years, and every year has been different. 

I asked him a couple weeks ago “Do you want to do gifts, or should we just do cards? I’m fine with either.” 

He said, “Let’s do gifts.” 

I said, “What kind of level of gift are we talking, here?” 

He said, “Something silly.”

I said “Okay, because I don’t want to make you feel bad by getting you something that’s much better than what you get me.”

He said, “Don’t worry. That would not make me feel bad.”

And we had a good chuckle. 

So cut to yesterday, Valentines Day. While having our coffee in the morning, my partner hands me a card. I say to him “Can we exchange these later?” I hadn’t gotten his yet. I had a long and stressful week at work, and Partner has a 3-hour class on Saturday afternoons - so I planned on going shopping then. 

He says, “Later….like sometime next week?”

I say, “No, like at dinner. When we typically exchange gifts.”

He says, “That’s fine, but open yours now.”

So I open his card. It’s a picture of a smiling coffee cup and it says “I love you a latte.” The inside was him mostly explaining the joke. “It’s funny because we often have coffee together.” I could see from the back that he got it at the grocery store across from his house. Which is fine. Totally fine. 

We go our separate ways, him to his class, and I to go shopping. I pick up a card. Pick up a nice bottle of whiskey and some candies for him. £70 - not exactly silly, but he doesn’t like flowers, and has a nut allergy, so chocolates are always a gamble. 

So dinner comes around and I give him everything. He opens it, thanks me. And then….nothing. He goes back to making dinner. I’m thinking he’s going for some sort of big reveal. But as the evening progresses, it appears that's not going to happen.

Later, when he went to throw away the bag the whiskey came in, he said “Oh, I didn’t see the candies. You got me two gifts…”

And I say, “Yes, and you apparently got me nothing?”

He says, “Yeah, I thought that was apparent when I didn’t give you a gift this morning.”

After that, I stopped talking. Like in general, because I was pretty pissed. To be honest, I don’t really care about Valentine’s Day. I would have been totally fine just giving each other cards. In fact, I suggested it, if you recall from earlier in my story. I just can’t wrap my brain about how he would specifically request a gift and then not get one for me.

I’ve landed on being pretty mad, but I can't tell if ignoring him last night was enough, or if I should continue to be angry today. I messaged some friends and they said that I should be chill and forget about it. I think they’re wrong, and I’m currently debating on if I should steal the whiskey back or let it stand in his liquor cabinet, as a reminder of that time he messed up Valentine’s Day. But maybe that's too much.

1r59euz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r59euz,An important lesson for Indian brands,"Last week was a quick in-and-out trip to the US Cosmoprof Miami, partner catch-ups, and a lot of discussion around tariffs.  
  
India → US tariffs that were once 0% went all the way up to 50%. Unworkable.  
Thankfully, the revised India–US trade deal brings it down to \~18% still tough, but at least workable.  
  
Now, what surprised me wasn’t in a meeting. It was in food.  
  
All my life, “the best chocolate” meant one place: Switzerland.  
Pure, classic, heritage.  
  
But across the US I kept seeing a new obsession show up everywhere dessert pop-ups, cafés, and even Starbucks:  
  
Dubai chocolate.  
  
Pistachio. Kunafa. Melt. Crunch. Drama.  
  
So I asked myself: is this fluff, or real innovation?  
  
My take: it’s not chocolate innovation. It’s consumption innovation.  
  
Dubai chocolate is winning because it delivers three things instantly:  
 • A new indulgence moment (more “treat” than tradition)  
 • Visual + texture theatre (built for phones)  
 • Premium cues without intimidation (global, but easy)  
  
That’s exactly why Starbucks is adopting it.  
When a mass brand wants to stay culturally current, it doesn’t only add new items it adds new reasons to walk in.  
  
The lesson for Indian brands is straightforward:  
  
Don’t copy “Dubai chocolate” as a flavour. Copy the principle.  
  
In whey protein, biscuits, snacks, desserts the next winners will be the ones that make “better-for-you” feel like: pleasure first, benefits second.  
  
Switzerland owned chocolate with heritage.  
Dubai is owning it with experience.  
  
And the US is the first place you see these shifts go mainstream.",1,1771143892.0,u_ManishBChowdary,0,1.0,False
1r59esb,https://i.redd.it/bh894up36mjg1.jpeg,Update: Thanks for the Help,"Sorry for the late post, but I just want to give an update. I was the person who was asking about the Moka seasoning and I decided to buy some $6 Ground Coffee and season the moka 3 times before using it. And didn't use any soap bc I didn't feel comfortable. I have used my Moka already many times and the Coffee came out great. When Im done using it, I put the moka in cold water and rinse it out only with warm water and drying it with either a paper towel or a kitchen towel, and I leave it out to air dry. The water vessel is not dried but instead I put it on the stove so the water evaporates (apparently its to prevent mold. I leave it to cool and then I save it until next time. I like to thank u/GreatBallsOfSturmz, u/younkint, u/One-Confusion-33, and u/Platypushaun for the help tips. Thanks :).",11,1771143884.0,mokapot,3,0.92,False

figured i'd share some info if you are heading to see the extreme dwarfanator wrestling show on 02/15. even though lamar is a smaller town things get really packed around the theater during events like this and finding a spot right when you arrive at 6:00 pm can be a massive headache.  
  
before you deal with the street parking mess you should check out Prked. it is an app where you can rent driveways or garage spaces from people living right near the venue. it is way cheaper than the official lots and you get to skip all the post-show traffic since you are not stuck in a bottleneck. it is usually just a really short walk to the entrance and way more secure than leaving your car on a random side street.  
  
if you decide to try your luck with street parking you should look along main street first but those spots go fast since the theater is right at 219 s main st. your next best bet is to check the side streets like olive street or beech street. there are some municipal lots a few blocks away near the old train depot that usually have space but you have to be careful about any private lot signs because they will tow you if you are not a customer of the local shops.  
  
traffic can be a bit weird because main street is also part of highway 50 and 287 so there are a lot of semi trucks and through traffic passing through town. give yourself an extra 20 minutes to circle around because once the crowds show up for the 6:00 pm start the best spots will be gone. the local police are pretty strict about blocking fire hydrants or parking too close to the intersections so definitely double check your bumpers before you head inside. honestly it is better to arrive early and grab a coffee or a bite nearby so you are not stressing about the start time.  
  
hope this helps everyone have a great time at the show.",1,1771143633.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I’m 28, but I move like some old grandfather.

I moved here for work a year ago, and honestly, the hustle in this city is real, but the physical toll is something else. Between the 10-hour shifts and the absolute nightmare of a commute in this humidity, my back is basically a mess. By the time I get home, I don't even have the energy to go out for a decent meal or even talk to my flatmates properly. I just end up lying on the floor under the fan because my spine feels like a literal question mark.

It’s so frustrating because you want to explore, check out the beach, or just drive around, but your body doesn’t support it. Last month, I was so desperate I actually started carrying one of those frido cushions to office because the chairs there are so hard to sit on. It helps with the tailbone pain for sure, but the overall exhaustion of just... sitting all day in this weather is still there.  
  
I see people going for a run or hitting the gym at 8 PM and I’m like, where is this energy coming from? I reach home and I can barely stand straight to make a cup of filter coffee. My mom calls me from home and asks why I sound so low, and I don't even know how to explain that I'm not sad, my lower back is just throbbing and it’s making me super irritable.  
  
Is this just the price we pay for the corporate life here? Like, does everyone in the city just live on Volini and caffeine, or am I doing something fundamentally wrong?",6,1771143627.0,chennaicity,3,1.0,False

I want to drive around Da Lat, is it possible with a 50cc? (alone or with someone on my back)

 

I saw that the terrain is full of mountains and I am afraid a 50cc wont do it.

I don’t want to rent any bigger bike, even through it would be much more comfortable, I don’t want to spend any more coffee money and rather drive legally.",1,1771143583.0,VietNam,3,1.0,False
