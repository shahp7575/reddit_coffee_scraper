Not sure if these types of posts are allowed, but I'd love to get the word out and hear any feedback from people who've given us a try.

We've been open in Edmonton for about 10 years now and are super excited to finally be in Sherwood Park. We're a family-run pizzeria - I actually started working here when I was 15 and liked it so much that I married into the family! 

We believe in making killer pizza with fresh ingredients we'd be proud to serve our own family, but also in being a great place for a first job.

1q7mlsl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q7mlsl,"In-Hand Review: Stussy Dice Knit is a 10/10, but mixed feelings on the CH Jeans 🎲 (ft. Nike, Amiri)","1. Chrome Hearts Multi-Color Cross Trucker Hat**

**Rating:** 7/10
**Review:** It’s a loud piece. The colors on the crosses are vibrant, and the mesh quality is standard—breathable and decent for hot weather. However, the print on the foam front feels a little plasticky, like it might crack or peel after a summer of wear. The silver button on top is a nice detail, but overall it feels a bit lightweight compared to other CH caps I’ve handled.
**Fit:** Standard snapback fit. Sits a bit high on the head.

### **2. New Era NY Yankees Fitted (Side Patch)**

**Rating:** 9/10
**Review:** Can’t go wrong with a classic. The embroidery on the NY logo and the side patch is super clean—no loose threads or connected stitching. The brim came with a standard flat shape but curved easily. The wool blend feels structured and durable. Not much to complain about here, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
**Fit:** True to size. Fits my head shape perfectly without pinching.

### **3. Nike Tech Fleece Jacket (Grey/Black)**

**Rating:** 8/10
**Review:** The color blocking on this is sick, gives it a more aggressive look than the solid grey ones. Material is smooth and comfortable, standard Tech Fleece quality. My only gripe is the main zipper; it feels a little stiff and catches slightly near the bottom. Hopefully, it loosens up with wear.
**Fit:** Fits slim. At 180cm, the Medium is a perfect fitted look, but if you want to layer a hoodie underneath, you might struggle. Length is spot on.

### **4. Chrome Hearts Black Tonal Cross Jeans**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** These are way more wearable than the blue ones (see #6). The black-on-black patches are subtle and the leather crosses feel decent quality. The denim itself is heavy and rigid, which I like. The buttonhole was incredibly tight, had to fight it to get them open the first time. The wash looks authentic.
**Fit:** Waist is TTS. The length stacks nicely on my Jordans without dragging on the floor.

### **5. Supreme Box Logo Hoodie (Black)**

**Rating:** 7.5/10
**Review:** The blank on this is heavy and stiff—definitely a winter hoodie. The box logo embroidery is centered and straight, no floating 'e'. However, the neck hole is surprisingly tight/small. It’s a struggle to get my head through without messing up my hair. It’s a classic piece, but the comfort isn’t 10/10 due to the stiffness.
**Fit:** Boxy fit. Sleeves are a tiny bit short for my arms (180cm), but the chest is roomy.

### **6. Chrome Hearts Blue Patch Jeans**

**Rating:** 5/10
**Review:** Honestly, not feeling these as much in hand. The craftsmanship is fine, but the design is just too loud in person. The ""CHROME HEARTS"" text across the back is huge and the blue leather patches contrast too much for daily wear. The denim feels slightly thinner than the black pair (#4) as well. Hard to style without looking like a walking billboard.
**Fit:** Fits same as the black pair, straight leg cut.

### **7. Stussy Dice Knit Sweater**

**Rating:** 9.5/10
**Review:** Favorite item of the haul. The knit is surprisingly soft and not itchy at all against bare skin. The dice graphic is woven in clearly, not just printed on top. It has a nice weight to it and drapes really well. Feels like a quality garment that will last a long time.
**Fit:** Slightly oversized/relaxed. The perfect baggy fit for my build.

### **8. Amiri ""Imagination"" Hoodie**

**Rating:** 6/10
**Review:** A bit disappointed with this one. For an ""Amiri"" piece, the blank feels kinda thin and flimsy compared to the Supreme or Carhartt hoodies. The print is okay, but it feels like it might fade after a few washes. It looks cool, but the quality doesn't match the aesthetic. It feels more like a fast-fashion hoodie than a luxury rep.
**Fit:** Fits slightly cropped and wide.

### **9. Carhartt WIP Embroidered Hoodie (Cream)**

**Rating:** 10/10
**Review:** Best bang for your buck. The cream color is beautiful in person (though I’m terrified of spilling coffee on it). The ""Carhartt"" embroidery is thick and premium. The fleece lining is super soft. It’s simple, clean, and feels indestructible.
**Fit:** TTS. Not too boxy, not too slim. Sleeves hit perfectly at the wrist.

### **10. Stussy Arch Logo Hoodie (Black/Yellow)**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** Another solid Stussy piece. The yellow text pops really nicely against the black. The logo is a chenille-style texture which adds some nice depth. It’s a good daily driver hoodie. Cuffs are nice and tight, holding the sleeves up well.
**Fit:** Fits similar to the Carhartt one, maybe a little looser in the chest area. Ideal for a relaxed street fit.

We were together for 2 years and we broke up a year ago now. It was hard on me. She’s a good person but she did a lot wrong through the process. I understand why it happened to an extent. We’re not far apart in age but I graduated before I even met her, so she was living like me (a recent grad in the workforce) instead of like a college student.

I have never reached out to her at any point, but she routinely finds reasons to text me. Six months after the breakup, she called to tell me that she missed me. We got together for coffee and she told me that when she called, she HAD wanted to get back together with me, but that she decided she just wasn’t ready “yet”. I took that one in stride and set some boundaries while still being understanding, on the assumption that she’s not a malevolent person, just struggling.

Four months after that, and a couple months ago, she texted me out of the blue. She had previously ghosted me when I had asked her if we could finish our last conversation about boundaries, so I assumed I would never hear from her again. She texted me to send videos from a band she thought I’d like. She said that I had been on her mind and that she thinks of me often. It felt very much like she was testing the waters to see if I was angry, but then I haven’t heard from her since.

I half expected her to text after the new year. We had good Christmases together and I figured that they must remind her of me as much as they remind me of her. I feel compelled to text her or call her even if she doesn’t reach out to me. I want to tell her that I miss her and that if she plans on fixing things that she’s running out of time. If her saying that she wanted to get back together eventually was real than I need to know, and if it was lip service, I need to know that too. I feel like I’m stable enough that I could hear that she’s moved on without it crushing me because I’ve had enough time to put things in perspective. I also want to tell her that she needs to stop reaching out to me if she doesn’t know what she wants. It sets me back when I get coded messages from her and have to interpret what she might mean. If she does reach out again, I want to know that SHE knows what she wants and isn’t going to put me through the wringer again.

1q7mg43,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatalframe/comments/1q7mg43/ff5_writeup_part_1_characters_story_a_frustrating/,"FF5 write-up part 1 (characters, story) - a frustrating messy narrative with some glimpses of brilliance","Through a lot of delays, I've finally had the opportunity to play and finish Maiden of Blackwater, the last mainline entry currently (that's not a remaster or a remake, here's hoping we get Fatal Frame 6 in the future). As always, I played it in Japanese, which in this game is a brutal choice (I'll discuss this more later). This will be far more rambly, rather than anything cohesive. This is part 1 of what will probl'y be 3 parts, I have a lot to say about this game and so this post will cover the story and characters.

My expectations were lower for this entry, I knew of its reputation as the game that damn near singlehandedly almost killed the franchise, but also as the game that somewhat resurrected it, upon its porting to modern platforms.

Black sheeps of any franchise are always fascinating. It's interesting to me to freshly experience them and see exactly where it all went wrong, if it even did. Some games get a bad reputation in their franchises initially, yet are later re-discovered by a fresh pair of eyes and are given a second lease on life, being appreciated for what they did right or at least for attempting something new and trying to push boundaries. Metal Gear Solid 2, Final Fantasy 2, Final Fantasy 8, I am sure I could find more examples if I look.

Nonetheless, from my experience with black sheeps of a franchise, ones still thought of like that, it usually comes down to controversial gameplay changes (like FFXIII or Resident Evil 6), a fumbling of the story (Zero Time Dilemma) or some sort of disrespect to characters fans have grown to love in the past games that feels insulting ( Metroid Other M). Looking at Maiden of Blackwater, it has elements of all of these. Admittedly maybe I am trying too hard to fit a triangle peg in a circular hole but In my defense the circle is big  enough for it.

And yet, starting this game and within its first 5 or 6 drops (chapters), I was having a good time despite seeing where some hiccups may lie. After Fatal Frame 4's blend of western, eastern and polynesian influences, FF5 returns to mainland Japan with a somewhat more contemporary setting. It's a mish mash of various influences, of both traditional and urban horror.

Much like how the franchise as a whole has leaned on Japanese horror cinema as a major influence, MoBW continues this, while also working with more found footage and internet horror style inspirations mixed with a dash of anime (particularly in its more visceral violence). Its events are by far the most fantastical the series has ever been, and that is where it crosses that border between grounded cinema and anime. Which I didn't mind. 

I think it makes it a breathe of fresh air, while still notably being a Fatal Frame game. But, I am getting ahead of myself, let's rewind back to the beginning. There is something to talk about here.

We start of playing as one of our new protagonists, Miu Hinasaki. The game immediately starts you off soaked in water surrounded by a lot of...f\*k it, I'll be about as subtle as the game...massive cleavage all around you. This is where I have to mention this game's issue no.1 that I admittedly knew about going in: the over sexualization.

I wish to be clear that I am not a prude nor do I think sexualization has no place in horror media or media in general. Japanese traditional horror in particular is able to skirt this line and depict temptation and seduction followed by horrific consequences, usually historically meant as a way to dissuade lust and lustful thoughts. And in essence, the water maidens here are conceptually just a branch of that, and as enemies I don't even dislike them.

Where it all goes wrong are their models and the engine the game runs on. Both cursed by Dead or Alive. From what I've heard, the modeling team that worked on this shares an overlap with the team that worked on Dead or Alive 5. It kinda shows. The proportions are just...outrageous and the jiggle physics genuinely make it very hard to take anything seriously. I really think that care and attention should have been placed on getting this right, because the ideas themselves aren't bad, the execution is just very poor.

This is something that I will come back to as a general statement for the game over the course of this write-up, it all feels very half baked and careless. A ""good enough I guess"" kind of attitude that seems very pervasive and kneecaps this game. Perhaps that is a bit unfair from me, I can't claim to know what the development behind this game was like nor that the people who poured hours of their life into this game didn't care about it, I am almost certain they did and it does show in some instances.

To continue on the topic at hand, it does seem that most of the issues with this games...uncouth presentation do lie with DoA and its accursed physics and the models being questionably proportioned in a way that just hurts the ability to take it any kind of seriously. Which is baffling because the other games do this sort of sexy but also creepy theming right. Just look at the falling woman, Kyouka from FF3 or Kageri from FF4.

I would just like to rattle of some other examples of how themes of sex, seduction and horror can and have mixed in Japanese folk horror media, and that I can see what MoBW was going for:

\- Tomie by Junji Ito  
\- Cosmology of Kyoto  
\- Mononoke (not princess)  
\- Requiem From the Darkness  
\- Kuon (leans more on pure body horror to be fair)  
\- Tons of yokai and ghost stories like Yotsuya Kaidan and Yuki-Onna

It's something that has its place, but has to be done extremely carefully to be effective. With the blackwater maidens, that balance is almost struck. They are alluring, playful, they want to take your hand and drag you to your death.  Genuinely, I really like them as enemies. But then you fatal frame them and see the jiggling and it's just...WHY!? Did no one on the dev team try to stick up and say ""guys, this is just wrong, can we please find some way to tone this down?"".

It's truly frustrating, because I don't mind the art direction at all. It's really a unique mish mash that, at its peak, really works together. I just really wish that they had used a different engine or tried to prevent their modelling team from undermining all of it and making it crude, immature and that they had the sense in them to understand that whatever sales they might make going for this type of appeal is not worth pretty much inviting yourself to be made fun off by anyone who wanted to take the game even remotely seriously.

Luckily the main character default designs could definitely have been worse, Yuri's design is great. Some of you may be screaming at me to bring up a certain mechanic in this whole topic, the wetness stuff. I'll talk about it in a separate post discussing gameplay.

Moving on, after a somewhat frantic prologue in which Miu gets trapped in a box while running from ghosts, you are introduced to the main main character of Yuri Kozakuta and her mentor Hisoka, as they explore an abandoned and dilapidated building trying to fulfil a request to find something. I was genuinely immediately hooked by this as a premise.

Yuri is a very sweet and precious character and If there is anything to take away from this game it is that she deserved better than being a part in a 3 piece. She needs her own game, because she functions as a perfect vector for telling other stories. She's a hyper empathic psychic capable of seeing others memories and experiences, and she puts this to use working with Hisoka.

They run an antique store that also works as an agency which willingly takes missing persons and objects requests and ventures into the mountains to search for them, using the camera obscura as a tool of the trade, rather than an object that the characters happen to stumble on to, all while unraveling mysteries and telling stories, all related to the hauntings and urban legends and traditions surrounding the mountain.

On its face, this premise is so fun and the first story here delivers on this premise too. Fuyuhi and Haruka, 2 people who love each other, attempt suicide with other people and survive. They want to tell each other that they love each other, yet never quite get to do so. It's a classic tale of heartbreak and tragedy, but it is mostly well executed. It also introduces another serious topic in the story: suicide. Another thing that is very touchy and needs to be done right. The mountain that the game is set in, Hikamiyama, is branded as a mountain of death where people go to die, and is a subject of many rumors and urban legends.

I will have to sit on with how it is handled across the entire game, it sort of loses importance from the middle of the game onward. It does play a big part in Yuri's backstory and I do like it there as someone who relates to her being isolated and having those feelings, as I was very much like that in my teenage years. We are shown that Hisoka saved her and became her mentor, taking her in and giving her a lease on life. Hisoka was also traumatized by a girl she was unable to save, and genuinely the cutscene where we find this out was heartfelt and touching.

After we find Fuyuhi and do some escorting, she wonders off and the next time we see her...she cuts her throat right in front of us. We see later that this is because of the blackwater maidens, but it is this scene that got me the most hopeful for the game. It was visceral, well directed and packed with so much emotion and shock that was sincere and brutal. You can see that Fuyuhi, with renewed purpose and love of Haruka, is still clinging to life because she wants to tell Haruka she loves her. And yet, despite that, the maiden forces her hand. It's a scene that quite earnestly left me shocked, even despite everything I've seen in this series so far. Every part of it was executed to damn near perfection in my eyes, and, honestly, the entirety of the 2nd drop is one of the strongest chapters in any Fatal Frame game to date.

I was so hype for it too, over the bloody moon for it. If the game could keep up that level of quality, that raw visceral emotion that snatches your heart straight from your chest, I was so prepared for it. And then...it just...pardon the thematical pun, falls of a cliff in this regard. First of all...Yuri is kind of not affected by it as much as I would expect she would be, especially given what we later learn about Hisoka's backstory. It is a narrative tie, Hisoka warns Yuri not to search for missing persons and the first case she accepts she sees a suicide.

Perhaps it would be a bit cliche to have her on the ground sobbing or in the bed crying after it but some sort of strong emotional trauma response would be appropriate, yet she just keeps trucking along to find Haruka in the drop after the next.

The next drop, the first one with Ren and Rui and the exploration of the abandoned building, finding the story of the owner of the place, being further introduced to the maidens, it was still very intriguing and appropriately tense.

Yet for the entire rest of the game I was waiting for my heart to be shattered and for tragedy to strike, for our main characters to have to deal with these hardships and go through hell and highwater (pun intended on both of these) and come out the other end as stronger. My disappointments really increased chapter by chapter, in a way that I can't quite put my finger on. The lore and reveals tied to it are handled as you would expect, yet it feels like our characters and their presence takes a strong backseat. 

There were notes and memos left by certain characters to describe the way they are feeling and for us to learn more about them, although in this game where I had such a close proximity to each of the characters, going into Yuri's room as Ren and picking up her diary to read about her character from another character's perspective just felt...invasive and kind of offputting.

Why don't we get a conversation between the 2 of them instead? A heart to heart? This game already includes more dialogue than we're used to. Even if it is only written dialogue and not voiced, I don't know why they shy away from it so, they did do written dialogue in FF3. In that game I could talk to Miku or Kei as Rei, so...why not here? It doesn't help when there are clearly things happening that characters should be strongly reacting to and showing a lot of emotion for because...I mean it's only human, anyone would do so.

Yet when stone-faced Yuri rescues Haruka, she does sweet fuck all to make sure she doesn't run off again. In her defense she may have not foreseen that she would, yet her reaction to seeing Haruka run off and die is the non-verbal equivalent ""ah dangit!"". And she never reacts to knowing Haruka has also died now by being a pillar. Unless I missed it somehow, we never see her try to beat herself up over it or show guilt or remorse. Something that is very human and especially would relate to her mentor Hisoka again.

What I mentioned about Haruka is a recurring issue. So many chapters in this game revolve around rescuing the same people over and over again. And then doing sweet fuck all to prevent them from wandering off again. I understand that I am simplifying this a lot, Ren does have his story of his reoccurring dream where he stabs a girl and his story is by far the one that has the most intrigue tied to it really and you do explore separate parts of the mountain and learn a lot each chapter.

Yuri and Miu each revolve almost exclusively around rescuing their respective mother figures. Yes, they both do get characterization beyond that and get one or 2 scenes together, one which I did like, but at the same time it just is not nearly enough. By the end, sure, Miu has learned a lot about her past but...how has she really changed? What has Yuri really gone through that visibly has her become a different character by the end, and same for Miu? For Yuri it is almost understandable, yet even though she cries whenever she touches Ose and shares in her pain, there are rarely any other opportunities for her to show her empathy and help others. 

You could argue she does with Miu but also not really? Why didn't this game revolve solely around Yuri using her powers for finding people, reading their stories but also working through her own emotions on knowing how traumatic all of these stories are, especially when they end in tragedy? I would pay another $50 for that game. 

The story, as a whole, and again it could be my grasp of the language so I'm happy to replay it in the future and see what I might have missed, feels half baked to all hell. Most of the gameplay sections really revolve around exploring the various places you are sent to in search of Hisoka, Miku, Rui or the rare other times it is anyone else, reading lore documents on the history and practices of Hikami. The story of the characters and the actual setting and lore feel incongruous in a way that the previous games didn't suffer from imo.

Yes, other games had you doing something similar, Miku went into Himuro and was trying to both survive and piece together what happened through documents and tapes. Same with Mio and Mayu and to an extent the FF3 trio. Yet I never felt such a disconnection between the characters and the world they inhibit as I did in this game. Damn near all of them feel so aloof and lax about their situations. Their antique store is beset by hauntings by the midgame and yet besides having Ren do nightshift duty they seemingly employ no measures to protect themselves.

No Ofuda, rope, they don't even talk. This game is one that has our characters interact the most yet they never f\*\*ing talk about ANYTHING relevant. Events just happen and the most they can muster is ""oh...Rui's gone off to die again jeez, guess I better go get her smh"". Some of the people you rescue sit in these boxes for days, weeks, sometimes YEARS, yet there is no semblance of muscle atrophy or unclear consciousness. It's just ""can you walk? You better be able to"". They don't even question whether what they're seeing is real and they're not just being lured into another trap. There just is very little actual conversation that would realistically happen. The past Fatal Frame games don't have this issue because they don't put characters in situations where that can necessarily become a flaw. And in one game where that IS a factor, I.E FF3. the characters do actively talk and try to figure out their situation.

Remember the myriad letters and phone calls between Kei and Rei, Miku and Rei actively working to investigate the situation? Putting pieces together and being proactive participants rather than just reacting? What the hell happened to that?? They were dealing with a threat far more incorporeal and yet they manage to pull it together and put and end to it. 

There are times where some emotion shines through, yet it still feels so weird. Like Miu, whom cares about Yuri so much while knowing her for a very short period. Yes they did do a mutual spirit backstory exchange of sorts, but truly the scene where Miu prevents Yuri from drowning in the lake feels like a payoff for hours and hours of friendship and thawing of the ice between them, when in reality this is just the first (of a whopping 2, TWO drops Miu is playable).

Yes, Yuri does save her life and she does read a lot about Miu, but stretching this as much as possible, it still feels like a payoff they wrote ahead of time, and then awkwardly stumbled to however they could to it.

And this is all the more frustrating because we truly do see glimpses of a very heartfelt and poignant narrative. Miu's final scene with Miku is touching, Miu hugging Yuri is touching, the coffee scene between Hisoka and Yuri is likely the best in the game and all of Ren's endings and his ties with Kunihiko are explored well and really make you feel for Ose.

Ren's story is one that feels most completed, yet Rui suffers for it. They have this Rui is secretly in love but Ren is kind of not returning the same vibes so she's just kinda shy and in a way kind of...wants to be captured so Ren could care about her type of thing? It's...just weird. They start of having great banter and having a fun aloof mentor/sharp student sort of dynamic. I was really looking forward to their levels and the way they could work together.

Yet Rui does sweet fuck all during these drops, and in fact is often a liability. I was thinking they would have some cooperative puzzles to solve with each other, maybe she could use the spirit stone flashlight to aid in combat, maybe she could even become shortly playable and be able to crawl into places that Ren can't reach and Ren would have to give her the camera for certain sections, just f\*\*ing ANYTHING but just following you with borderline broken AI pathing (she would run into Ren multiple times and glitch tf out, which was distracting) and maybe adding some lines of dialogue here and there. 

Some drops you could have just with Ren and you would be weaker or less capable of doing stuff and it could really make you miss Rui and make the search for her mean that much more to the player. 

To be more positive, I didn't mind Ren's ancestorial relationship with the white haired girl, through his lineage with Kunihiko. It is the first time one of his descendants and an active playable character really explored that aspect of their heritage and piecing together the mystery was enjoyable, and home to some of the better scenes post Drop 2. Y'know looking past the whole child bride thing :|. The final drop also gives you a choice in the final Ren section, which is...a weird time to introduce something like that however, I will give praise to this and the endings and their requirements. First time through I picked the white girls hair locks and resolved that storyline, next time picking the bride photo and it was nice when I instinctively took a shot of Ose with my CO and that resulted in separate ending that marries gameplay and story (pun intended) very naturally. At which point I yell at the game to stop showing glimpses of brilliance cause it makes me remember that the rest of the package contained smelly socks and out of date cheese. 

Back to Rui, my issue is that she gets by proxy somewhat neglected in the story. Perhaps that is the point, but at the same time if the entire thing was that she has abandonment issues with Ren, shouldn't that something that should be framed as a pivotal point in her character? Something to deal with and grow from? Fatal Frame games have their ups and downs when it comes to character centric narrative. However, this one has a whopping total of 6 (3 main 3 support) characters it is trying to juggle constantly in its narrative and give each pairing a resolution, yet the time dedicated to doing that in the story is simply not enough. Again, frustrating, because each pairing has something that is interesting in their own way. Hisoka and Yuri share a sweet relationship, Ren and Rui are a fun duo (sometimes) and Miu and Miku have a lot they need to work through individually and together. 

It crumbles under the weight of its own ambition and leads to so many, for me at least, unsatisfying conclusions and payoffs. Speaking of which, let's talk about the controversial one. Miu is an incest baby. This one...I've tried to give my best faith shake at this decision but I can't for the life of me understand why they went with something like this other than pure shock value.

Now the whole shadowborn thing I wouldn't necessarily have an issue with. It's gross and uncomfortable but that's what horror is sometimes. Kuon does a similar thing and it isn't really out of line in Japanese horror. Hell, if it was handled well enough and Miu wasn't a Hinasaki, I think it could have made for a compelling character arc, a character fights to learn their past, makes a horrifying reveal and than has to deal with it. It's tried and true yet the way they handle it is partially through a cutscene in which Miu doesn't really go ""whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?"" and then tries to process the information. She really doesn't seem to care for anything beyond ""oh my long absent mom I barely remember is back yay!!!"". And then it is explained through text documents that fu\*ing REN reads. REN!

But, even leaving aside the piss poor execution imo, why did they feel the need to just piss on the legacy of such a beloved character? For what reason did they have to tether Miku once again to her damn brother? We spent the entirety of FF3, whose entire theme was grief and loss, trying to get over each of the respective losses the protagonists of that game suffered. Rei/Yuu, Miku/Mafuyu, Kei,Mio/Mayu. Did you truly think that THIS is what fans of the franchise wanted for this character? To be impregnated by her dead brother, put in a box on a mountain abandoning the resulting daughter at 3 years old? Even the most depraved fanfics wouldn't envision something like this, it's all just ill conceived (pun intended). 

Even in a best faith reading that she didn't harbor any such desires for Mafuyu (which I hope isn't the case) and her longing for a connection was exploited by the mountain for their purposes, and she (and subsequently Miu) is a victim of this, truly, why was any of this necessary to be in this game? Why couldn't the game focus entirely on Yuri and Ren if there are multiple protagonists? 

I don't dislike Miu as a character, but I just truly think that there were about a dozen and a half ways any of this could have played out and, even if you are to commit to Miu's backstory as is and have Miku have her as she did, that is a story for an entire game all on its own, not a 2.5 chapter side note shoved into an already bloated mess that can't make room for all that it wants to tell. 

And that is really the crux of the issues here, there are so many interesting building blocks for the story to work on, such an interesting premise, compelling setting and if not likeable then at least interesting characters. And yet, your main character Yuri barely has a story besides looking for Hisoka and being formerly suicidal, Ren has 2 concurrent stories between him filling in the lore and tracking his ancestor Asou and his relationship with Rui, one of which has somewhat of a completed pay off, the other one which just feels repetitive and padded, as well as disrespectful to the character of Rui. And then your last character only gets 2.5 playable chapters and also happens to completely insult a character the fans spent 2 prior games deeply bonding with while also spending at least one of those chapters kind of building a bond with Yuri? To me it felt un-earned even with the whole psychic thing.

The last thing I have to discuss on the general story front is our resident instant kill dispenser antagonist: Kurosawa Ouse, an ancestor to Rei and Hisoka and the great pillar (pillar is what the box maidens are referred to in Japanese). I actually really like her on a narrative level. She fits into the themes nicely and has a cool design. She gets a happy ending and finally we have another final antagonist after Kirie who gets de-eviled for a bit and gets to talk to you for a bit, on multiple occasions. An appropriate amount of time is spent learning about her and Kunihiko to make the good ending payoff between her and Yuri, as well as the ones she gets with Ren, both meaningful. 

I just wish she had more than a paltry few gameplay appearances in which she does nothing but kind of teleport in front of you for a set period of time. I really didn't feel intimidated by her in the slightest. But, to not detract from the positive, she is a constant presence from the start of the narrative and is humanized really well. 

Overall, I know I'm not the first person to say it, but truly this narrative is a real disappointment all things considered. I tried to give it its best shake, truly and to be fair some of it could be down to a language barrier so I'm happy to replay it in the future. Still, as a fan of character driven narratives and seeing characters overcome their personal struggles and come out the other end of them, the potential that was here just felt suffocated and unexplored. The game is drawn in all kinds of directions and crumbles under the weight of its own ambition. 

But, to give credit where it is due, after sitting on it for a while, I can recognize that there is yet a heart beating underneath what feels like a game puppeteered by corporate influences, be it Tecmo shoving their goonery, 

I'm not exactly asking for an RPG level narrative, but since this is a level based game now and not a traditional survival horror, I think they should have taken advantage of that to feature more locations and more curated levels that were more deliberately designed. Have each drop preceeded by an antique shop section like you had the house segments in FF3, where Yuri, Ren and Miu talk about what their plans are, what is going on, put together information, maybe even fight or have drama at times that gets resolved over time. 

This would allow you to make each drop even more intense and pushed to the limit, because you would have the breathing room to chill out in the antique shop and perhaps use your points to buy coffee from Hisoka and just have a nice time getting to know the characters. Maybe you could have a sort of system where depending on your actions during drops you could influence the relationship between the characters and even have an Onimusha 2 style branching narrative. Maybe? I don't know maybe I'm just desperate for another game that isn't Onimusha 2 to try something like that because it was really f\*ing cool. 

I mean think about it, how much more meaningful would it have been for Miu to hug Yuri to stop her from drowning after going through most of the game having them start not getting along due to Mius ice cold apathetic nature, only to slowly warm to each other and care about each other? Maybe an earlier drop could have Yuri rescue Miu from recklessly charging into the temple and getting trapped only after they established they don't like each other very much. Only to have Yuri rescue her tears in her eyes punching Miu's knee lightly going ""you idiot, never do that again"" to Miu's confusion. You could reference that line when Miu rescues Yuri instead and have that be a payoff between them. 

In conclusion, this game really makes me appreciate the past games more, and how they were put together. Next up will be gameplay, exploration, atmosphere. Seeya there!",2,1767902870.0,fatalframe,0,1.0,False

Now back to my girl. I'll get up at 6, make coffee and read a book. She'll sleep in until 9 am. We will do a short 45 minute walk (we don't even go a mile) where I let her sniff her heart out. Breakfast is given using some kind of puzzle, or as of late, vitos thinking game. She takes multiple crate naps. She gets to play with her dog pals for about 20 minutes a day. I play tug with her and play with her beloved flirt pole (play is about 20 mins). We do small training sessions throughout our day (think 5 minutes on learning a trick or working on threshold manners, leave it etc). She is more than content to just hang out at my feet all day.

1q7mf9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/NZXT/comments/1q7mf9d/is_this_too_dirty/,Is this too dirty ?,"AITA my boyfriend seems to be obsessed with my husband’s cream.


It all started 16 years ago when I first laid eyes on my boyfriend, a few weeks later we agreed to have coffee at his house. As it was my birthday I had already been over to my ex’s place and been filled so I thought it would be a good idea to play my new player as he was already in a relationship too. The hesitation when he first went down on me was a classic as I know I didn’t taste like a female usually does seeing as I was loaded with ex but I kept this to myself all these years until recently. His reply was that I had tasted many women off his dick too, some of the times he told me beforehand so that was ok.


Anyway I seem to be the worst in the world at orgasming so it took several years before I achieved this, and the main reason was that my boyfriend told me to fill up with hubby before meeting with him, this worked a treat as it turned me on so much that I cum instantly on his tongue for the very first time then it gave him delicious lube for the anal play which he has also been the only one to try with me, something I had fantasized about all my life so he popped that cherry for me too.


We had many fucks after that, most before work, most lunchtimes, every Saturday when daughters were at netball, his girlfriend’s work timetable worked in really fine with me. OK so she did see some photos I had emailed him and she told me I could have him cos he’s so easy and she left him oops.


I enjoyed eating food off him, crazy positions, I bought a sex swing which he hooked up in his garage (by then he was living alone LOL), I even visited him once with 10 x $100 bills inside my pussy for him to find when he went down there.


Years down the line when sex was scarce boyfriend told me to get another lover which I did, so our new game was I collect from hubby, get lover to eat it and fill me while boyfriend is listening on the phone then boyfriend comes in for the real treat, his full mouth over mine so we can both share lover’s juices then get into the great sex that boyfriend and I have always shared.


Now we have progressed to videoing our fucking, this started by my setting up camera in hotel for lover then boyfriend without any of them knowing then sending it to boyfriend. Now he tells me to vid my fucking hubby while he blindfolds his girlfriend and sends me heaps of him licking and fucking his girlfriend, she has no idea but boy she has a sweet looking pussy.


He sent me a vid of her blowing on her vibrator just as he entered her so she cum all over his cock, great vid but it broke my heart that doesn’t happen with me, he said I shouldn’t have sent it, I said no I love it but can you please do that for me. Our next meeting he did try but my body is so stubborn, I love to give him money each Christmas so I gave him $1000 for the effort. The next time I tried again, my body stubborn again so I told him to basically go read a book while I got myself off on my sucky vibrator and I called him in when I was just about to blow. Success !! I was going off like an idiot but I didn’t care, I got there. I told him to look in my toy case and he took out the other $3000 for his reward.

Since I started building PCs in my teens about \~\~20 years\~\~ Edit: 30 years ago (wow I'm old), I've always messed around with Linux but never used it my daily until recently. I had read about Bazzite working well for all games and wanted to get back into gaming but was lamenting what Windows 11 had turned into as I find it unbearable and basically alien compared to what it was when they first released 11 N. Anyhow, after I realized I can't stand Bazzite being immutable, I got a bit more daring and realized that wayland can be on any distro.

After trying a few distros, I was working with Fedora 43 and got super frustrated at how everything I was trying to ""improve"" was just making my system more unstable and said eff it and threw on my Arch ISO expecting to just cry myself to sleep after that. But then something weird happened. Building the OS by hand instead of UI made everything click in my brain, like as if all the pieces I was trying to put together finally just fit correctly. The command structure makes sense, package systems make sense now, it's cute and fun, and best of all, it feels like the OS has bits of me spread through it. Feels natural and I know where everything is and why it's there, why it works, and why I have it set up that way. And now it's my daily driver, even for my work laptop, which btw, Arch for laptop is amazing.

Now to get to the reason I am posting, I am still obviously a big noob and I am trying to expand my knowledge and learn more programming etc. I am also starting my certs for A+ and hoping to have a bunch of certs on my resume by EOY. OSs I am currently working with:

pfSense - On my old system from 2012 (I am aware that this is not energy efficient, but I am not concerned with that for the time being.) I have been able to get it work correctly and have had a couple of instances of getting ProtonVPN to work on it as well as WireGuard, but not both at the same time. I am sure I'm not thinking in the right sense of the why and how, and for now I have opted to not use either as it works fine and I built a new PC that has distracted me from it.

OpneWRT - On my WiFi router, but I haven't done much aside from turn it into an AP, and from what I read, the router I got isn't as flexible as it's predecessors, and I don't use WiFi much aside from my phone so it's at the bottom of my list. GL.iNet Flint 3.

Arch - On my new setup, AMD 9950X3D, RTX 9070 XT, 32g ddr5, 2tb Gen 4 x 4 3d tli nvme, and laptop ASUS ROG Strix G16 (2024)

Ubuntu Server - On my previous system, i7-8700k 8th gen Coffee Lake, RTX 2080ti, 64g ddr4, 2tb gen 4 x 4 3d tli nvme (although running at gen 3 speeds), 3tb 5400rpm SATA III NAS HD I had lying around (plus I have 5 more 1tb SATA III I plan to install as I run out of space.) I am running this because I want to make it into my home storage and move away from cloud storage as well as host games like Valheim, Satisfactory, Foundry VTT, maybe some FPS, in hopes I can make some friends.

Things I've learned about recently: Docker and VM. Learned Docker and containers are good for running single programs and dabbling in a vacuum as to not interfere with base OS setup. Thought I was going to run the game servers on them, but realized I am going to better off on something like Ubuntu LTS. VM for running OSs inside the current OS, but I haven't really thought of a use for that aside from certs that I am going for.

With Ubuntu Server, and I am not married to the OS btw, I want to figure out what all I need to do to have it going securely and optimally for running Valheim (my first choice of games.) I don't really know where to begin as I just installed it yesterday. I am quite comfortable finding information on Arch and learning, but with Ubuntu I feel like I am asking the wrong questions because I am unsure what it is that need for what I want. Am I going to need Discord, how should I be setting up SSH on my home network so it's not exposed to the public, is it better to SSH into the system instead of directly, how does Steam work on the system. I have a lot of questions, and feel kinda overwhelmed, but I don't want to give up. Also, are chatrooms still a thing, like IRC? Do horses wear socks?

1q7maai,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q7maai/put_your_phone_away/,PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY,"A few months ago I noticed something kinda messed up. I was just overstimulated as fck all the time. Any tiny pause in my day and my phone was already in my hand and it got me tired at a point.

The worst part was how uncomfortable silence felt. Simple moments like waiting in line, walking or sitting alone for a minute felt extremely hard to do nothing. I always had that FOMO, so I would often check my phone in those times.

So I stopped trying to “use my phone less” and tried to fix my attention instead. I started watching podcasts (Cal Newport) and reading books (Dopamine Nation) that helped me get some ideas and methods to combat this addiction I had.

First thing, no phone for the first hour after waking up. No scrolling, no msgs, no news. Just coffee, moving around, letting my brain boot up. First week sucked. After that, mornings felt way less chaotic luckily.

Second, I only pick up my phone for one reason. If I open it to reply to someone, I reply and put it down. No reward scroll after. Sounds stupid but this one broke the autopilot loop hard.

Third, I replaced fast dopamine with slower stuff. Long walks with no podcast. Music without doing anything else. Writing random thoughts instead of checking apps. Way less exciting, but my brain calmed the fck down.

Fourth, I got clear on what I actually want to work toward. Once I had something real to build, scrolling felt way less tempting. Using some apps helped me organize goals and focus on real progress.

Fifth, I pushed all the fun to night time. If I wanna scroll or watch dumb videos, fine. Just not all day. Knowing it’s there later makes it easier to not reach for it constantly.

At first everything felt boring as shit. Then slowly focus came back and now I can concentrate easily (obviously in tasks that I like haha)

Don’t think I am monk now and I don’t scroll anymore. I still scroll sometimes. I still waste time. But now my phone feels like a tool again, and that’s a relief for me. That alone changed way more than any productivity trick I ever tried.

What methods actually helped you use your phone less and use it in a more productive way? Would love to hear your methods/tools/apps!

1. I spent about 40 minutes researching a warm berry lip liner to match with my new mini MAC lipsticks (Chile and Dubonnet), and to wear on its own. I’ve always had something like this in my makeup bag and the last iteration of it was expired. I was debating between a $25 MAC liner, vs drug store dupe - I spent so much time scrolling through swatches of drugstore dupes and reading reviews.

2. I am very into red and pink nail polishes and although I love the warm classic red that I have (Olive and June CV), it feels like it leans “summer” and I wanted to find something deeper, warm, and seasonless. I spent about 30-45 minutes browsing the O&J website.

What I bought

1. Crest whitening strips - I have had 0 work done and am trying to take better care of myself and this over the counter treatment seems so straight forward. I’m a coffee drinker. 

2. A denture cleaning container - I grind my teeth at night and I need to wear a night guard or I sleep horribly and get headaches and neck aches from grinding. My night guard has embarrassing stains, but replacing it is $600-800 and it still technically works. I got a Zima cleaner a few years ago but it grew mold an and I still have the cleaning tablets. My night guard hangs on my tooth brush stand, falls all over the sink, into the tooth brush stand, ends up my nightstand, and I put it into my mouth every night. 

How I felt

1. Teeth whitening is not a permanent treatment by any means but it also inexpensive and non invasive and seems worth trying. Crest white strips have been around forever and there are lots of before/after stories that demonstrate results. It may improve my appearance subtlety and the risk of it not working is low. I “wear” my teeth every day. Seems practical and worth trying. 

2. I am so much happier that I bought this denture cleaner container rather than more cosmetics - especially when I already have a lip liner in the mail that may work for my needs, and I have several red and pink nail polishes that I love and can use more often even if it’s not “perfect” in shade and undertone, season, etc . This night guard is an important part of my health and taking better care of it is taking better care of myself. It feel like an act of self respect not just an act of “self care”. 

3. I’m working on reducing my screen time and I realize how much time I spend mindlessly shopping online, browsing for things I don’t need, and sometimes I even feel a sense of dread when the packages arrive because I don’t have space for more clothes, makeup, or accessories that I don’t need. I’m missing out on my life and wasting my intellect and talents in this consumerist treadmill, chasing after imaginary products that I think can change my life, when in fact, my mindset, self image, self respect, and health can change my life more than makeup and clothes. 

Sometimes I ask myself what feeling is really driving the shopping - 

I wish that a new handbag could fix my problems and make me interesting. Ten years ago that might have been true. 

I wish that someone would buy me something special for Christmas that would make me feel beautiful and treasured. 

I wish that I had a party to wear this top to. 

Confronting these emotions is scary and often sad, and I’m avoiding them more than I’d like to admit. ",3,1767902510.0,MakeupRehab,0,1.0,False

It was light-hearted bickering but the mom was really pushing to pay. You'll pay next time, she said. That's what moms do, they balance the scale when the world becomes too much. 

In the middle of this bustling café, the mother-daughter relationship to me felt so special. I looked around and saw quiet moments of kindness and connection that most people would miss. Does anyone else see these tiny little scenes where love feels so big? 

Title: Finding Acceptance in the Solitude 

Body: I spent last Saturday hiking alone in the nearby woods. The solitude, oddly, comforted me. Alone in the forest with only the sounds of nature around me, I started to feel this overwhelming sense of acceptance. I had always thought of myself as a person who needed other people to feel whole but the undergrowth and the rustling leaves seemed enough. 

Does anyone else find a strange contentment in being completely alone or is it just me? 

Title: The Pressure of Unvoiced Expectations

Body: My best friend has always been free-spirited, a go-her-own-way kind of person. It's really striking to see how her family keeps trying to mold her into their own conservative paradigm. It's like watching a bright, radiant sunflower expected to turn out like a rose. 

It seems unfair to squish people into boxes they don't feel comfortable in; it's their life after all. Does anyone else have friends or family who deal with this kind of unspoken pressure, and how do you help them cope?",1,1767902404.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

He'll chop and slice you, cut and dice you up as the patch work man watching you and as I come to ripped reality bubble and kills you as he's looking at his victims or victims.

Swaying a the wind as this night as a horrible as they looking at this house were there dead body’s and parts of body's like hand and feet and more importantly this happens a little when people are looking at this blood red on the ground and seeing everywhere it's like someone painted and spilt everything looks like a spotted of blood as this was a start of the day at will be a darkest hours as they founded a name/words say that the patch works man was here as well a name is written down by the police as they looking at this monster mess as one CIA and FBI were people who trying to understand the story of a legendary story turned out to be a great headache for everyone.

As this was at 23:50am as people saw the news crew were everyone one is recording every single moment and details as people think that the murder might come to the crime scene , were thinks that the murder might be here to watch everyone by no he's not here he's somewhere else watching on the TV screen of breaking news late at night a continue evolution on the moving news talking about what happened on Friday would be great to see what happens as patch work man watching and drinking warm drink of coffee with whiskey in the coffee.

They carry on in this rainy night time as everyone in the house is claimed as they looking at everything , 

(pov of a horrible night time of murder with a few police and one CIA and FBI were there and news Crew and it live breaking news and carry on to the morning , As lots of body parts and a lot of blood and a name/word says patch work man was here. A new horror Halloween theme story.)

 The Patchwork Man's Debut
The air tasted metallic and thick. It wasn't just the blood—though there was enough of that to fill a bathtub, slicking the pavement under the pulsing blue and red chaos of emergency lights. It was the frantic, toxic blend of fear, adrenaline, and ozone from the news cameras.
The murder scene was a tableau of absolute nightmare: body parts, carelessly strewn, forming a grotesque, incomplete silhouette on the cold concrete. It looked less like a murder and more like a butcher shop exploded.
The Professionals Arrive
The first responding patrol officers were pale, rigid statues, their hands hovering near their sidearms. Then the heavy hitters rolled in.
A handful of Police cruisers formed the inner perimeter. Then came the unmarked cars. FBI Special Agent Marcus Thorne was the first to cross the yellow tape, his face a mask of weary professionalism that slipped slightly when his eyes tracked the scene. Beside him, gliding with unnerving calm, was CIA Officer Elias Vance, dressed in a suit that looked far too expensive for a crime scene. Vance didn't look at the gore; he was looking at the people—specifically, the press—calculating angles and threats.

 Live Breaking News
The media swarm was instant and overwhelming. Beyond the outer cordon, the harsh, white glare of mobile floodlights carved the darkness. A dozen microphones jostled for space.
""We are live in downtown, where a horrific scene has unfolded,"" boomed the voice of veteran reporter Veronica Cole, her tone a perfect blend of genuine shock and ratings-driven urgency. ""Police have confirmed multiple victims in what can only be described as an act of calculated, savage violence.""
On the wall of the alley, spray-painted in a sickening crimson that was too fresh, was the signature:
PATCHWORK MAN WAS HERE.
The name crackled across the police radios and, within seconds, across every major news network. A new boogeyman was born, live on air.

Carrying on to Morning
As the night wore on, the initial shock calcified into grinding, methodical investigation. The forensics team moved like ghosts in white suits, tagging evidence. Thorne and Vance exchanged low, tense words. The blood began to dry, turning from wet crimson to a rusty, indelible stain.
By the time the first sliver of morning sun touched the highest buildings, cutting through the smog and the artificial light, the Patchwork Man had already achieved infamy. The news vans were still there, the reporters now haggard, delivering updates on the hour. This wasn't a story that would fade. It was a new era of horror.

That is a fantastic shift! Starting the horror event outside of the US—specifically between China and the Pacific Ocean—immediately raises the stakes, globalizes the threat, and explains the unusual joint presence of the FBI and CIA later on.
This setup makes it feel like an international incident, not just a local crime.
The International Prologue: East Asia & Pacific
Let's set the initial, truly horrifying crime scene in a location that serves as a vital geopolitical intersection between China and the Pacific Ocean.
The Starting Location: The Port of New Shanghai, Japan
Rationale: Naming it ""New Shanghai"" (a fictional Japanese port city) suggests a massive, modern, and bustling industrial hub that handles immense shipping traffic to and from the US and China. This is a place full of transient workers, huge containers, and dark corners—perfect for a killer to operate unseen.
The Scene: The first ""Patchwork Man"" incident occurs in the massive cargo container yard of the port. The victim(s) could be dockworkers, security personnel, or victims smuggled on a container ship.
The Story Shift
The sequence would be:
Night 1 (New Shanghai, Japan): The initial, gruesome discovery is made by local Japanese police. The body count, the blood, and the signature ""PATCHWORK MAN WAS HERE"" are discovered. Because the victims/contents of the container have potential international ties, the CIA gets involved immediately (concerned with global stability/terrorism) and the FBI's International Liason is alerted. The breaking news is massive in Asia, but only a small, confusing blurb in the US press.
Night 2/Morning (US Location): The ""Patchwork Man"" (or a copycat/follower) commits a chillingly similar crime in the US, perhaps using the same modus operandi but now striking a US target. This is where the media frenzy and the domestic investigation (Police/FBI/News Crew) explode.
 The US Location for the Escalation
To give your US incident a great backdrop, let's use one of the prior suggestions:
The Escalation Location: Blackwood Bay, Oregon, USA
Why it works: The Pacific Coast connection is strong (ships travel directly from Asia to the Pacific Northwest). Blackwood Bay's dark, rainy, and industrial vibe makes it a perfect landing spot for a sinister element arriving via the sea.
The first US victim is found in the Blackwood Bay shipyard's historic district, confirming that the threat has traveled the Pacific.
Revised POV Start (Night 1 - Blackwood Bay, Oregon)
Let's jump into the horrifying US scene, knowing the real start happened a day earlier across the ocean.
The metallic tang of blood in the rainy air of Blackwood Bay, Oregon, mixed sickeningly with the salt spray of the Pacific. It was 3:17 AM. All eyes—the few local police, the arriving FBI/CIA contingency, and the unforgiving lenses of the news crews—were on the scene.
This wasn't just a murder; it was an act of horrific, global terrorism. Local investigators had received the panicked, whispered files from Japan only hours ago. Now, the same grotesque signature—the same impossible volume of blood—was here. The US media, previously unaware, went instantaneously nuclear.
""The Patchwork Man,"" whispered Agent Thorne, staring at the message scrawled on the damp, brick wall of an old shipping warehouse. It was here, and it had arrived by sea.
Does this sequence—starting the terror in Japan's Port of New Shanghai and having the escalation in the Pacific US city of Blackwood Bay, Oregon.

(Four 🧱 wall - The only reason why I wanted to do it from a different point. All the boring horror movies are always based in the US. I just wanted to think of basing it around somewhere near the water of somewhere overseas stuff. That's not always based on all horror movies should not be always based on a boring America area cuz Aaron's probably sick of LA horror stuff, New York horror places. Boo. I absolutely agree! It's great to break away from the typical American horror settings and explore something unique. The idea of starting your story near the water in an overseas location is a fantastic starting point that adds so much depth and intrigue. We're on the right track with New Shanghai, Japan, then Blackwood Bay, Oregon. What elements of this overseas location are you most excited to explore in your horror story?.
Do a random one that could be anywhere. So I started somewhere probably towards the water area of the Asian area. 
Okay, let's get completely random and find a uniquely Asian, water-adjacent starting point that sets up a global thriller. No typical horror settings here!.)

Today is my seventh day smoke-free. I quit using Asmoken/Tabex (for those who don’t know it: it’s a “plant-based” alternative to varenicline).
Quitting itself was much easier than I expected. I was especially worried about habits like drinking coffee without a cigarette, but that actually hasn’t been a problem at all.
What has been difficult is my mood. It feels like a kind of flatline. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, but my emotional state feels very constant — not good, not bad, always with a slight sense of melancholy. What stands out to me most is that those moments where you genuinely look forward to something seem to be gone. Everything feels a bit numb. That honestly worries me, because I’m afraid of developing a more serious issue.
I don’t really know many ex-smokers I can talk to about this, so I’d really appreciate hearing about other people’s experiences and how long this phase lasted for them.
The reason I quit smoking is simple: I no longer want to be a smoker. I enjoyed smoking, I could afford it, and I didn’t have any health problems forcing me to quit. After 14 years, I stopped entirely by choice. For me, the benefits clearly outweigh the downsides. Cutting down or switching to vaping wasn’t an option — I know myself well enough to know I’d eventually end up back at the same number of cigarettes.

1q7m0tl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q7m0tl,Claire Saffitz's Coffee Coffee Cake,"I know there has been a years-long debate about this recipe, but...

I basically followed Claire's recipe with a few exceptions: I only had 3 eggs; I ran out of brown sugar so I replaced what was missing with white sugar and some molasses; I also ran out of cinnamon. But the big change I made was adding 4 oz of crushed raw pistachios in the ribbon which I tossed in 1 teaspoon of cocoa powder. The ribbon fell too much because the nuts made it heavy. I should've put more batter underneath it. Honestly, the nuts don't add much.

Like Claire I used a Brooklyn cold brew, but **not a concentrate**. I think a lot of the people who complained about the lack of coffee flavor didn't note that she's using a cold brew concentrate - super strong!  Maybe this is in the video but not the book. I gave myself permission to be a little heavy-handed with the coffee crystals.  

It was tricky determining when it was done.  The center stays wobbly for a while.  I baked it at 340 convection but raised it to 350 after 45 minutes. The middle has to show a little bit of rise.

Result: It’s delicious. Light and not at all dry, and you can't miss the coffee.  I know this because my wife, who hates cold brew, tasted it in the first bite.  Oh well, more for me 😉",6,1767901945.0,Baking,2,1.0,False

**Rating:** 7/10
**Review:** It’s a loud piece. The colors on the crosses are vibrant, and the mesh quality is standard—breathable and decent for hot weather. However, the print on the foam front feels a little plasticky, like it might crack or peel after a summer of wear. The silver button on top is a nice detail, but overall it feels a bit lightweight compared to other CH caps I’ve handled.
**Fit:** Standard snapback fit. Sits a bit high on the head.

### **2. New Era NY Yankees Fitted (Side Patch)**

**Rating:** 9/10
**Review:** Can’t go wrong with a classic. The embroidery on the NY logo and the side patch is super clean—no loose threads or connected stitching. The brim came with a standard flat shape but curved easily. The wool blend feels structured and durable. Not much to complain about here, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
**Fit:** True to size. Fits my head shape perfectly without pinching.

### **3. Nike Tech Fleece Jacket (Grey/Black)**

**Rating:** 8/10
**Review:** The color blocking on this is sick, gives it a more aggressive look than the solid grey ones. Material is smooth and comfortable, standard Tech Fleece quality. My only gripe is the main zipper; it feels a little stiff and catches slightly near the bottom. Hopefully, it loosens up with wear.
**Fit:** Fits slim. At 180cm, the Medium is a perfect fitted look, but if you want to layer a hoodie underneath, you might struggle. Length is spot on.

### **4. Chrome Hearts Black Tonal Cross Jeans**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** These are way more wearable than the blue ones (see #6). The black-on-black patches are subtle and the leather crosses feel decent quality. The denim itself is heavy and rigid, which I like. The buttonhole was incredibly tight, had to fight it to get them open the first time. The wash looks authentic.
**Fit:** Waist is TTS. The length stacks nicely on my Jordans without dragging on the floor.

### **5. Supreme Box Logo Hoodie (Black)**

**Rating:** 7.5/10
**Review:** The blank on this is heavy and stiff—definitely a winter hoodie. The box logo embroidery is centered and straight, no floating 'e'. However, the neck hole is surprisingly tight/small. It’s a struggle to get my head through without messing up my hair. It’s a classic piece, but the comfort isn’t 10/10 due to the stiffness.
**Fit:** Boxy fit. Sleeves are a tiny bit short for my arms (180cm), but the chest is roomy.

### **6. Chrome Hearts Blue Patch Jeans**

**Rating:** 5/10
**Review:** Honestly, not feeling these as much in hand. The craftsmanship is fine, but the design is just too loud in person. The ""CHROME HEARTS"" text across the back is huge and the blue leather patches contrast too much for daily wear. The denim feels slightly thinner than the black pair (#4) as well. Hard to style without looking like a walking billboard.
**Fit:** Fits same as the black pair, straight leg cut.

### **7. Stussy Dice Knit Sweater**

**Rating:** 9.5/10
**Review:** Favorite item of the haul. The knit is surprisingly soft and not itchy at all against bare skin. The dice graphic is woven in clearly, not just printed on top. It has a nice weight to it and drapes really well. Feels like a quality garment that will last a long time.
**Fit:** Slightly oversized/relaxed. The perfect baggy fit for my build.

### **8. Amiri ""Imagination"" Hoodie**

**Rating:** 6/10
**Review:** A bit disappointed with this one. For an ""Amiri"" piece, the blank feels kinda thin and flimsy compared to the Supreme or Carhartt hoodies. The print is okay, but it feels like it might fade after a few washes. It looks cool, but the quality doesn't match the aesthetic. It feels more like a fast-fashion hoodie than a luxury rep.
**Fit:** Fits slightly cropped and wide.

### **9. Carhartt WIP Embroidered Hoodie (Cream)**

**Rating:** 10/10
**Review:** Best bang for your buck. The cream color is beautiful in person (though I’m terrified of spilling coffee on it). The ""Carhartt"" embroidery is thick and premium. The fleece lining is super soft. It’s simple, clean, and feels indestructible.
**Fit:** TTS. Not too boxy, not too slim. Sleeves hit perfectly at the wrist.

### **10. Stussy Arch Logo Hoodie (Black/Yellow)**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** Another solid Stussy piece. The yellow text pops really nicely against the black. The logo is a chenille-style texture which adds some nice depth. It’s a good daily driver hoodie. Cuffs are nice and tight, holding the sleeves up well.
**Fit:** Fits similar to the Carhartt one, maybe a little looser in the chest area. Ideal for a relaxed street fit.

**T+03:21:00 (Pulse 134)**  
*Venus Orbiter Operations, Night Shift Room with Dim Lights*

Night shift rooms always felt like the inside of a submarine: dim light, muted voices, and the quiet arrogance of humans thinking they could keep watch over planets with coffee and screens.

The monitors cast a soft blue glow across the faces of the two operators on duty. Everything else was shadow: empty chairs, coiled headset cords, a vending machine humming like a bored insect. The air smelled faintly of warm plastic and stale caffeine.

On the main display, VESPER hung in its orbit around Venus like a patient lantern, a machine with a job and no opinions about it. Its instruments watched the planet in ultraviolet and infrared, and listened to the ionosphere the way a physician listened to a chest, hunting for murmurs that meant trouble.

Rina Torres had been trained to treat the Sun like weather. Space weather was still weather: probabilities, indices, timing windows. You learned the patterns, you learned the hazards, you learned to stay humble.

But the alert that slid onto her console didn’t feel like weather.

It felt like a verdict trying to wear a forecast’s clothing.

SOLAR EVENT PROBABILITY RISING  
UNUSUAL GLOBAL OSCILLATION DETECTED  
POSSIBLE EXTREME FLARE/CME NEAR-TERM

Rina’s face went warm, that quick flush of adrenaline that always arrived half a second before the rational brain caught up. She clicked open the packet, scanning the words again, as if they might soften into something routine if she stared hard enough.

Unusual global oscillation.

As if the Sun had decided to start tapping its foot.

She pulled up Venus’ induced magnetotail data. Normally, it was a living mess, exactly the kind of mess she trusted: the solar wind slamming into Venus’ upper atmosphere, draping magnetic field lines around the planet, flexing and snapping and reforming. Venus didn’t have Earth’s strong internal magnetic shield. It had a borrowed one, an induced one, a temporary umbrella made out of a constant argument between plasma and field.

Tonight the argument looked… constrained.

The magnetotail was tightening, not in a gradual drift but in a patterned squeeze, like someone was cinching a drawstring at regular intervals. Compression, release. Compression, release. The same signature appearing in multiple channels.

Rina leaned forward until her eyes were too close to the plot.

“That’s not-” she started, then stopped because finishing the sentence felt like making a claim the universe would punish.

Her console beeped.

A small, polite sound. A system notice.

But the timing of it made her skin go cold.

She glanced at the timestamp. Then at the previous marker.

Ninety seconds.

A pulse.

The magnetotail tightened. The ionosphere response spiked. Particle counts fluttered upward like a startled flock.

Ninety seconds later, it happened again.

Rina’s mind tried the standard list, the comfortable inventory of reasons:

Instrument cycle. Telemetry cadence. Data packet batching.

She checked the metadata. The sampling rates were not ninety seconds. The packet timing wasn’t synchronized that way. Different instruments, different clocks, and yet the planet was responding as if it had been taught a rhythm.

A third pulse arrived, right on schedule.

Rina’s throat went dry. She turned to her teammate, a man with tired eyes and a posture that suggested he’d been awake for years.

“You seeing this?” she asked.

He rolled his chair closer, leaned in, and stared at the overlay without speaking for a long moment. In the dim light, his face looked older than it probably was.

Finally he said, “That’s… rhythmic.”

Rina felt the word land in her chest like a weight.

Rhythmic meant driven.

Driven meant agency, or at least forcing. It meant something upstream wasn’t simply flaring and relaxing the way solar wind normally did. It meant something had introduced a clean periodicity into a system that lived on chaos.

She toggled the ultraviolet nightside feed. Venus’ faint airglow should have been a quiet smear, soft and constant.

Instead the emission was beginning to lift in synchronized flickers, as if the atmosphere itself was being tapped with a steady finger. Not an aurora yet. Not a storm yet.

A tremor.

A warning tremor.

Rina’s mind reached for something to say that wasn’t fear.

“It’s like…” She stopped. She didn’t want to say heartbeat. That word belonged to living things. The Sun was not supposed to have one you could set a watch by.

Another beep.

Pulse 134.

Venus’ induced shield tightened again, and Rina imagined the solar wind arriving not as a gusty river but as a set of measured waves, one after another, with a precision the Sun did not naturally possess.

Somewhere far away, eight minutes of light-time away, the star was doing something no star was supposed to do.

And here, wrapped in dim light and cheap coffee, Venus was answering the rhythm like a drumskin.

Rina swallowed and keyed her mic.

“Log this as coherent periodic compression,” she said, forcing her voice into the calm tone that made emergencies feel manageable. “Cross-check particle flux channels. If this escalates into a CME impact profile, I want timing on the first-arrival radiation front versus bulk plasma.”

Her teammate nodded slowly, but his eyes never left the plot.

Because the scariest part wasn’t that something might hit Venus.

The scariest part was that the universe had started keeping time.

And Venus, the planet that couldn’t protect itself the way Earth could, was already being squeezed to the beat.

It starts, as it always starts now, with a screenshot that doesn’t know it’s a match.

A cropped plot, black background, neon lines. A power spectrum with one obscene spike highlighted in a shaky red circle. The caption is too casual for the thing it contains.

“Solar folks: am I losing it or is the Sun doing a 90s metronome rn???”

It gets twelve likes in the first minute. Three of them are from people who shouldn’t be awake.

A reply appears from an account with a university logo in the bio and the kind of optimism that gets people tenure or ulcers.

“Probably instrument cadence / windowing artifact. Don’t panic.”

Underneath it, someone posts a second screenshot.

Different instrument. Different color scheme. Same spike.

No caption. Just the image, like evidence slid across a table.

**T+03:35:50 (Pulse 144 − 10 seconds)**

A space weather hobbyist with a radio tower in their profile photo posts:

“HF absorption just did a weird periodic squeeze. Anyone else seeing ~90 sec?”

It’s not a popular account, but it’s the kind of account that other obsessives watch like hawks. Replies come in from different time zones, from basements and garages and backyards where antennas point at the sky like question marks.

“YES.”  
“Thought it was my setup.”  
“Not my setup.”

Someone adds: “This is global.”

The word global lands like a stone.

A short video hits the feed, ripped from a screen recording, shaky enough to feel illicit. It’s a scrolling dataset with a faint periodic pattern, and a voice off-camera whispers as if the universe can hear.

“It’s… it’s every ninety seconds. It’s like it’s breathing.”

The video ends with a hard cut, the kind that happens when someone realizes they’re recording something they’re not supposed to record.

The comments are immediate.

“Fake.”  
“ARG?”  
“This is from a real dashboard, I’ve seen that UI.”  
“Why is nobody talking about this??”

Someone is talking about it. Everyone is, now.

A meme account gets there second, which means it gets there loud.

A picture of a metronome. Under it, a picture of the Sun. The caption:

THE SUN: “1… 2… 3… 4…”

It gets more engagement in two minutes than the original plot got in five.

That’s how it spreads: not as a warning, but as entertainment. The brain’s way of touching a hot stove with a glove.

**T+03:39:44 (Pulse 146 + 44 seconds)**

A livestream starts, titled with a question that is trying to disguise itself as clickbait.

“IS THE SUN… SYNCING?”

The host is a mid-tier science communicator with a calm voice and a ring light. You can see the fear in the way they keep smiling.

They hold up the same plot. Then another. Then a third.

They say “likely instrumentation” three times in four minutes, each time less convincing, each time sounding like someone reading the safety card while the plane is already shaking.

The viewer count climbs anyway.

**T+03:41:05**

A leaked audio clip appears. Twelve seconds long. No context. Just voices on a conference line, compressed and grainy, but unmistakably adult.

“…our current best description is: the Sun is syncing.”

Silence. A dry cough. Then, faintly, someone mutters:

“Maybe it’s aliens.”

The clip cuts off.

The internet does what it always does with a forbidden sentence: it repeats it until it becomes real.

---

**T+03:42:30 (Pulse 148 + 30 seconds)**

A hashtag is born, not because it’s clever, but because it’s simple.

#SunSync

It begins trending in pockets, then spills. People post their own interpretations like offerings.

“This is definitely a military test.”  
“This is definitely a solar cycle thing.”  
“This is definitely the end times.”  
“This is definitely fake.”

Everyone is certain. Certainty is cheaper than fear.

**T+03:44:07**

A journalist at a reputable outlet posts the most dangerous sentence in modern society:

“Hearing chatter from multiple observatories about an unusual solar oscillation. Trying to confirm.”

That sentence makes it legal, in the public mind, to be afraid.

A flood of replies demands answers the journalist cannot give.

“Is it dangerous?”  
“Is this why my GPS glitched?”  
“Is this related to the aurora last week?”  
“Aliens???”

The journalist replies with caution.

“No evidence of immediate danger. Still verifying.”

The public reads: they don’t want to tell us.

*DKIST Control Room, Haleakalā Observatory*

By three and a half hours in, the control room had the atmosphere of a courthouse right before a verdict. Not loud. Not dramatic. Just a dense quiet threaded with the small sounds of people trying not to make mistakes while history watched.

On the wall, the Sun no longer looked like weather.

It looked like a structure under load.

The corona, normally a lacework of looped fury and tangled brilliance, had been combed into a symmetry that made Mara’s skin crawl. The loops were still there, still arcing and folding and glowing, but the messiness had been reduced into a small set of preferred curvatures, as if the field had been forced into a cleaner topology. Too many arcs shared the same radius. Too many footpoints aligned. Too many features held still when they should have jittered.

Order can be stability.

Order can also be tension.

Mara kept the EUV channels stacked beside the magnetograms and the Doppler maps, watching the same region from three angles of truth. In the helioseismic overlays the ninety-second mode kept landing like a hammer strike: disk-wide, phase-stable, refusing to broaden or wander. In the line-of-sight velocity maps, the photosphere “breathed” in a coherent global oscillation, a subtle in-and-out that ought to have been shredded by convection and differential rotation but wasn’t.

The phase stayed locked.

That was the obscene part. Not the amplitude. The fidelity.

Jun stood close enough that Mara could hear his breath catch every time the next pulse approached, as if his body had started anticipating the universe like it was a metronome in the next room.

“It’s compressing complexity,” he said, and it wasn’t a metaphor. He was looking at the helicity proxies, the braided twist of the magnetic field, collapsing.

Mara followed his gaze. The twist metrics were trending down with a stubborn monotony, like a system being driven toward a low-entropy configuration it hadn’t chosen. In normal corona evolution, stress accumulates in tangles: shear, twist, braided currents. It looks like messy hair because it is messy hair. Energy storage in the field lives in that mess.

But here the mess was being organized.

“Like combing,” Mara murmured, more to keep her voice steady than because she liked the comparison.

Jun made a sound that wasn’t quite a laugh. “Yeah,” he said. “Until the comb hits a knot.”

Pulse 151 arrived.

And the knot announced itself.

It didn’t start as a flare. Not a bloom, not a flash. It started as a failure of geometry.

On the EUV feed a long, thin structure near the limb began to deform in a way Mara had seen in smaller events a thousand times: a filament channel, a dark ribbon of cooler, denser plasma suspended in a magnetic trough, losing equilibrium. The spine of it bowed upward, subtle at first, then with accelerating inevitability. Its anchoring points held… and then didn’t, not by snapping like a rope, but by slipping, as if the field lines were being made to reconfigure faster than the plasma could follow.

A kink-mode signature bloomed in real time: the filament writhed, twisting around itself, the classic helical deformation of a current-carrying flux rope that has been pushed past stability. At the same time, the surrounding coronal loops began to lean toward it, not randomly, but in coordinated motion, as if the entire magnetic arcade had been tuned into the same mechanical response.

“Pre-eruptive rise,” someone said behind her, voice too tight. “It’s lifting.”

Mara’s fingers hovered over the keyboard, still not touching, as if contact might make it more real. Her eyes flicked to the magnetogram-derived field extrapolations: the modeled connectivity was changing. Footpoint mapping shifted. The magnetic skeleton of the region was reorganizing into fewer, cleaner connections, the way a stressed truss might redistribute load right before a buckle.

Then came the first true sign of imminent failure: a brightening that wasn’t a flare, but a seam.

Along a narrow line beneath the rising filament, a linear EUV enhancement ignited. Not a dot. Not a patch. A line, too straight, too fast, tracing the onset of a current sheet forming where the field was being stretched and thinned. It looked less like weather and more like fracture mechanics, a crack tip appearing in a stressed material.

Mara’s stomach went cold.

“That’s a reconnection front,” Jun whispered, and the word front carried all the wrong implications. Fronts propagate. Fronts spread.

The bright line lengthened. The filament rose faster. Adjacent loops snapped into new shapes with an ugly smoothness, as if the corona had been waiting for permission to change configuration and had finally received it. In the Doppler maps, flows along the filament channel surged. In the irradiance proxies, the region’s output began to climb, not as a sudden spike, but as the ramp of a system stepping from stable to metastable to gone.

The warning tone began, triggered by threshold algorithms that didn’t care about narrative.

It didn’t stop.

Exposure shutters adjusted. Gain dropped. The image hunted for balance and failed to find it because the underlying scene was no longer balancing anything. It was transitioning.

Mara watched the filament’s spine cross a point that made her throat tighten: the rise was no longer being resisted. The structure had left its equilibrium basin. The field had lost the ability to hold it down.

This wasn’t the flare yet.

This was the pre-flare structural failure: a coronal flux rope breaking containment, the magnetic cage deforming under a driver that didn’t drift, didn’t jitter, didn’t hesitate.

A system tightened too neatly.

A system about to release.

Somewhere behind her, someone said, “It’s going,” in the flat voice of a person watching a bridge begin to fold.

Mara didn’t answer. Her brain was trying to drag the event into familiar categories: filament eruption, tether-cutting reconnection, torus instability, runaway. The physics was all there, all textbook.

What wasn’t textbook was the timing.

Pulse 151. Right on schedule.

She heard herself exhale, thin and involuntary, and then she said, very softly, because saying it louder wouldn’t make it less true:

“Oh no.”

**T+03:47:30**

An amateur astronomer posts a photo of the Sun through proper solar filters, with a long disclaimer about safety, and then the honest truth:

“You won’t SEE it. You’ll see it in the numbers.”

That line gets quoted and requoted, because it’s the first thing that feels like a map.

The numbers are becoming the monster. The numbers, normally tame, are now telling a story no one rehearsed.

**T+03:49:30 (Pulse 153)**

A university PR account tries to douse the fire with a cup of water.

“We are aware of reports of unusual solar data. Please rely on official sources. Do not share unverified information.”

The replies are merciless.

“Then VERIFY it.”  
“What are you hiding?”  
“Official sources are always last.”

The PR account posts again, slower, as if typing through wet cement.

“Solar observations are complex. Anomalies can result from instrumentation.”

The public hears: This is real.

---

**T+03:50:30 (Pulse 147)**

The first credible thread appears, the kind written by someone who knows enough to be dangerous but also knows enough to be careful.

A solar physicist, anonymous avatar, posts:

“This is not a solar cycle signature. This is not one instrument. We’re seeing phase coherence across multiple datasets. Still investigating. Please don’t stare at the Sun. Please don’t panic.”

The thread goes viral anyway.

Not because it says “panic.”

Because it implies that panic is a reasonable consideration.

*SWPC, Boulder*

The first sign that the day was getting away from them didn’t come from the Sun.

It came from a phone.

“DeShawn,” Liz said, and there was a tone in her voice that belonged to accidents. Not the kind you cleaned up with an email, the kind you cleaned up with lawyers. She held her screen out like it might bite.

On it: a grainy twelve-second clip, reposted thousands of times, tagged with #SunSync and a dozen uglier variations. The audio was unmistakable, even compressed and chopped. Adult voices. A conference line. That one sentence, clean as a razor.

“…our current best description is: the Sun is syncing.”

Then the little laugh, the muttered word everyone wished hadn’t been captured:

“Maybe it’s aliens.”

The clip ended. The internet had already done what it always did: looped it, captioned it, remixed it, set it to a metronome sound, turned it into a punchline so it wouldn’t have to become fear.

DeShawn felt the room’s attention shift, the way a flock turns when one bird sees the hawk. A dozen heads leaned in. Someone said, “That was our call.”

“Jesus,” someone else whispered, and not as prayer.

DeShawn didn’t touch the phone. He didn’t need to. He could already hear the chain reaction: PR calls, congressional staffers, a thousand inboxes filling with demands that started with Is this true? and ended with What aren’t you telling us?

“Okay,” he said, voice calm in the way a tourniquet is calm. “We keep the language conservative. We say ‘anomalous oscillation’ and ‘ongoing investigation.’ We do not speculate. We do not-”

A shrill, polite alarm cut him off.

Not a phone notification. Not an email chime.

A system alarm.

On the big screen, a plot that had been moving like weather suddenly behaved like a guillotine.

X-ray flux climbed so fast it stopped being a curve and became a vertical line.

For half a second the room froze, brains trying to reconcile the leak with the new reality, trying to decide which emergency deserved the first breath.

Then chairs scraped back. Someone swore loud. Another person stood so abruptly their headset cord snapped tight.

DeShawn’s coffee tipped and spilled, unnoticed.

“X-ray spike!” someone called, as if volume could turn it into less.

DeShawn’s eyes moved the way training demanded: not to the biggest screen, but to the confirmation chain.

GOES X-ray: pegging upward.

EUV feed: blooming into saturation, protection flags tripping.

Proton monitors: beginning their first nervous climb, the early wake-up before the storm.

Magnetograms: a sudden twitch, field lines reorganizing faster than they had any right to.

For eight minutes, the public would still be staring at an ordinary Sun. For eight minutes, the world would be arguing in comment sections while the radiation front raced outward at light speed, already unstoppable.

But here, in Boulder, the numbers had already screamed.

On a separate display, coronagraph data lagged behind by processing time, the way everything lagged behind by physics. The Sun’s limb brightened, then tore in a way that made even seasoned forecasters inhale sharply.

Not a small, localized eruption.

A structured release.

A massive coronal expulsion beginning to lift off with an eerie coherence, like a shell forming, like a fist unclenching.

“That’s not a normal CME,” Liz said, and her voice had lost its PR concern entirely. This was the older fear, the one that lived in people who had watched space weather eat satellites.

DeShawn heard Jun’s metaphor from earlier relayed through the day’s chain of conversations, as if it had become a shared myth.

The comb hits the knot.

“No,” DeShawn said, and he hated how steady he sounded. “That’s the knot.”

The room became a storm of voices and keystrokes.

“Run propagation!”  
“Direction, direction, direction!”  
“Any SEP signatures yet?”  
“Radio blackout risk?”  
“Get coronagraph confirmation!”  
“Do we have STEREO angle?”  
“Where is it pointed?”

And because the leak had just lit the public on fire, the next question came fast, sharpened by dread:

“What do we say?”

DeShawn didn’t answer that yet. Words were not the priority. Physics didn’t wait for messaging.

He snapped to the comms panel and stabbed a button. “I want the Sun monitoring station on a dedicated line. Now. Patch them in or open parallel. I need their eyes and their coronagraphs, full resolution.”

A tech’s fingers flew. Somewhere, a phone started ringing into a room that hadn’t heard the alarm tones yet.

A senior scientist, pale under the fluorescents, spoke like someone reciting a checklist to keep panic from becoming contagious. “Bulk CME travel time is hours. Minimum. But the radiation front is already on its way. That’s… effectively immediate.”

DeShawn looked at the wall clock and then, reflexively, at the live solar feed that was already eight minutes old. The cruelest part of this work was always the same: the universe moved at light speed, and human comprehension moved in conference calls.

On the still-open conference line, Elias Venn’s voice came through, quiet enough that DeShawn had to lean toward the speaker.

“That’s the purge,” Elias said, and this time the word didn’t sound like theory.

It sounded like a step in a procedure.

No one laughed. Not because humor had died, but because humor required the comfort of thinking you were in control.

And in that moment, with a viral leak on the internet and a star-sized event unfolding eight minutes ahead of their eyes, control felt like the oldest lie in the room.

1q7lt5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/sayulita/comments/1q7lt5n/my_time_in_sayulita/,My time in Sayulita,"I posted a few weeks ago about my positive experience on our trip and was asked to do a bit more of a breakdown.  I'll do my best to be brief but informative.  

Our Airbnb was at the north end of the beach probably a quarter mile from the rocks and I will say it was so wonderful being away from the hub-bub of the main beach in town.  We walked down the path, set up our chairs and umbrella and the boys played for hours.  Everyone we spoke with talked about just how crazy the beach was in town - we avoided all of that.  First tip, book north.

Dinner breakdowns:

Our best dinner (first night) with a extra stop for dessert on our last night was at Chaman.  The atmosphere was awesome, the food and drink were great and the cheesecake was to die for.  It was also the best gauc and ceviche that we had on our trip.

La Rustica - good pizza, not great.  Beautiful atmosphere.  Ingredients were fresh and yummy.

Marys - This place was so highly recommended and had the longest wait of anywhere we visited.  The food was not a hit with anyone in our group.  It was just ok, at best.  

Don Pedros - beautiful, great food and sitting right on the beach was awesome.  We really enjoyed this meal and the drinks.

Santas Iguanas - wonderful pasta, very cute spot.  Staff was awesome and food was very very good.

Best street tacos:  There is a cart in front of the Sayulita Sports Garden that we ended up at 3 days in a row - they were hands down the best.  The Sayulita Sports Garden was also a great spot to watch a game and get a cocktail.  

Snacks:

The chocobanana was good and made for a fun afternoon snack.

Coconut on the side of the road - if you've never done it - yes, it was awesome.  Go find Jerry and have him put a shot of mescal in it too!  

Rollado - Ice cream tacos - expensive but 100% worth doing once.  What a cool product.   
  
Homemade Churros - this spot was right after you cross the bridge - I don't know the name, but it was so cool to see them put the dough in the fryer and make fresh churros.   

Coffee breakdowns:

Paris Delights:  This wonderful bakery became our go to every morning.  The owners are delightful, the product is amazing!  We cannot recommend this spot enough. Please note they are closed on Mondays.    
  
Bonito was just ok, walking distance from our Airbnb.  The chai was really good, but my coffee was not.  I finally moved to a plain cappuccino because a flavored latte didn't taste good at all.

Mar(ea) - good coffee, cute spot.  We didn't go back, but would have if our walking took us that direction in the morning.

Our favorite spot - Sadly, I don't have the name, but if you leave Paris Delights and turn left at the corner of Sayulita Sports Garden, there is a small shop about a block and a half down on the left.  It's ran by three young men, and we really enjoyed it.  

Beach dogs:  
What a wonderful treat they are.  So fun to watch and if you are lucky, one will adopt you for the day.

Surfing:   
We booked online with Wildmex and opted to meet in Sayulita and use their transportation to Playa La Lancha.  It was a great beach to learn on and we had a great experience.  We had two coaches, both from different parts of Europe.  It was awesome.  This was a wonderful experience.  

Whale Watching:  
We went out on the Nemo - I don't remember the tour company, but we loved it - saw wonderful whales and dolphins.  Be prepared for your feet to get wet getting in and out of the boat.  Bring water and sunscreen.

Trip to San Pancho:  
We took the bus to San Pancho, very fast and easy experience (but we did get on the wrong bus home)...so pay attention.  The walk into town was not bad.  We ended up eating on the beach at Olivia's and it was awful.  The village has other options - find them.  We rented surf boards and just hung out on the beach - it's worth going to see another beautiful spot.

Pediatrician told me last month to get her in with a pediatric GI before she starts solids. that appointment was today, and it just felt useless. she said to stop coffee and see if it helps the reflux symptoms and if not, give her meds. she was NOT helpful with MSPI stuff, just said we can't reintroduce anything to either my or baby's diet until 9 months. I left feeling kind of frustrated because I just feel more confused than ever. I am really struggling with diet stuff, tired of obsessing over the possibility of something I'm eating bothering her, and obsessing over diapers and how they look. 

My friend suggested I see an allergist to try and get a little bit more info before I potentially wean baby. Her son had FPIES and she thinks an FPIES educated allergist could be helpful. I'm curious what folks' experience has been with allergists, and if this seems necessary?

First Reddit post ever. I’m usually just a lurker. :) 

My 86 year old grandpa is diagnosed with dementia. He lives with his wife and they’re amazing together. She has no restrictions on her besides a knee that bothers her so they still live a quite full life. 

He spent his career as a psychology professor and often laments that he wishes he could still be working in that fashion. (Two years ago he finally ended a weekly call with a patient he’d had for 30 years.) 

He lives in Santa Monica, California and would benefit SO much from  weekly coffee with someone he could talk about life/psychology, anything! He is almost always in a good mood and really enjoys social interaction and conversations with people. 

If anyone would be interested or looking for something similar, I’d love to hear from you!

Unless it's time for dinner, any time I ask my husband if he's hungry / if he wants some of whatever I'm going to make for myself, he says ""no, I'm fine, you know I don't eat much"" (he also doesn't expect to be waited on) 
But will typically end up taking a bite or two or saying "" if you have anything leftover, I'll eat it""

Knowing this, I will always make extra.

Creeping around, really? 

""yes, creeping around, we do this all the time. You say you're not hungry then end up wanting it once you get a whiff. 🤣"" 

Oh. Thank you. You're the best.

Bruno laid completely motionless on one of the brown leathery couch cushions. His soft breaths spotting rivulets of his nose's condensation onto the shiny brown surface beneath him. Life had not only been good, but great. In the last hour, the hour that his instincts and routine dictated as the hour before his best friend Gale would come in, and his ears would be driven to pure ecstasy as the hard pebble shaped kibble would clank into a large stainless steel bowl in a waterfall of glorious food. The mere thought of the off-brand, Mega-supermarket, subsidized dog food, drove his salivary glands into overdrive, wetting his dry tongue with a heavy coat of drool. It seemed to also drive the whales insane in the ocean of green acid in his stomach, they bellowed their cries twisting and turning his intestines with each yell.

 Finally after what seemed to be days, the hard clinking erupted from the kitchen, and using the couch as a launch pad, Bruno sprung from the couch and bound to the kitchen with as much excitement and zeal as a child on Christmas morning. He bounded from the hallway, into the laundry room corridor, his bottom foot slid from underneath him causing him to crash into the white dryer. This slip seemed to be as pointless as one leaf falling from a tree, the food drove his canine mind, it made him almost feral. Without so much as a second thought Bruno popped back up and continued his high speed pursuit of the food. Finally he arrived in the kitchen where Gale, oh glorious Gale, had been scooping up some kibble for him to tear into. Intoxicated by the dull yet pungent smell of the meal to come, he hopped back on his hind quarters and began shimmying, left to right. His lazy balance, as dogs weren’t made to do this act for long, soon gave out and he fell back to the floor, his non retractable claws clicking upon the white large tiling that lined the kitchen floor.

 Gale smiled her sweet, understanding smile. A smile that had continually made Bruno’s stomach feel warm, as though he was under a blanket. He hadn’t understood why, maybe he never would, but he’d be damned if her warm smile’s embrace didn’t drive his heart wild. If humans could speak to their pets, not in the way they do now, with signage and syllables, but in a way in which man talks to man. Understanding in whole, not in parts or pieces. Gale could have told Bruno that he, that damn feline, and all the other animals in Gale's home, but mainly him and the cat, they filled a purpose not quite so mundane as being house pets. They served a meaning much more significant to Gale. They were her children. Not actually of course, but as one might adopt a child to fill that empty void of one’s soul, she had adopted animals. Not just any animals either, animals who were in need of loving. In a way the animals were her own little family. A modern psychologist might have a certain mental disorder to attach to Gale’s erratic behavior, but Gale would have it no other way. The animals gave her purpose, and Bruno gave her companionship. This last part was all Bruno could understand. The mere fact that he was loved and that he should love back. It was that simple.

 Gale bent down and began to itch behind Bruno’s left dorito shaped ear. This had caused an involuntary kicking of his foot, which he could tolerate at the time but had felt quite put off by this mechanical movement. He had no control over the action, it was simply instinctual. As instinctual as chewing or walking. He hadn’t known why he did it, he just had. Yet, here with Gale everything would be okay. He could be instinctual here, because Gale was here and she would love him regardless of whatever odd movements he made. His dreary eyes looked up to see Gales smile growing larger, she let out a small chuckle and then ceased her cranial button pressing. 

“You’re getting big Bru.” Her words fell on deaf ears as all his thinking had been on the bowl fixed in her right hand. He hopped up on his back feet, stretching out his front paws to land on her bosom. She slid to the side causing Bruno’s claws to tap again, like falling fish gravel. Her smile faded quickly and her face contorted into one of stern correction. “Bruno! No! I said no jumping!” Bruno stooped his head low, and shuffled backwards a few steps. Gale’s expression softened and she regained her motherly demeanor. “Bru, you gotta be careful, Love. You’ll give me a heart attack. You’re a big German Shepherd. You could’ve knocked me over. Be careful buddy.” Bruno didn’t really understand her words, but he had known they were coming from Gale’s heart. After all, he didn’t understand his size, as is the oxymoron of ‘Big Dog’. Isn’t every dog a small ten pound puppy at heart? Bruno sure thought he was. He was a big dog however, and Gale was a large woman. 

She sat up at five feet three inches tall, with a body mass of 330 pounds. Although a man of taller height had been found to pull off such a weight, she hadn’t been able to. Her body ached constantly and from new sources everyday. Her hair had begun to thin, and her newest accessory consisted of thick lens bottle cap glasses. Her vision, like her body, had given up on her. She hadn’t always been at this weight either, she was the classic tragic tale of peaking in high school. That was the past however, and Gale, as strong as she was hardheaded, had determined to not be defined by her weight. A decision that as her doctor had told her, “might stahp ya haght.” He was a skinny man from New England, probably never even feared the scale as she had. However he was right. Gale’s heart beat with a lover's zeal, that was true. Yet, it beat like an engine cylinder that had antifreeze instead of oil. She didn’t mind however. It was food she ate, wasn't it? She wasn’t out stuffing her gizzard with dog shit or dirt. So what did it matter if she had a dozen donuts before noon, drowned down with the sweet brown liquid named coffee? Nothing, and she had deemed that answer as true as a preacher swears to the truthfulness of the Bible. It wasn’t just true, but totally unbiased and factual.

Bruno however never noticed her weight, he had loved unconditionally and to tell the truth, with more fierocity than any lover from Gale’s past. He was always there, always seeking to please her in any way she deemed necessary. So as Bruno saw it, and Gale too though she would never tell a soul, the relationship was mutually beneficial. However there was one hitch, a gray one, with sharp claws and daggers where pupils were supposed to be. Obi was the beast of burden’s name, and it was Obi who now entered the kitchen. The cat walked to Gale, and slowly weaved like an old tapestry, between Gale’s tree trunk sized legs.

 Obi had been here first, so as far as the food chain went, Obi was top dog, and boy did he flaunt it. “Hello Bruno.” Obi mewed flatly at Bruno. “What brings you over here?” He continued, taunting Bruno, instigating Bruno to just try. Try to come at him and oh me oh my, see how fast Gale would scold him. Bruno at first turned a blind eye to the instigator, paying him with as much mind as he would a certain mailman who would swing by. Watching yet never really engaging. Knowing yet never really trusting. 

Gale reached down and grabbed the mangy little shit, and had begun to pet him, brushing her cigar sized fingers over his lumpy feline spine. She felt every bump, and vertebrae with a thin layer of skin cresting over the top, and when her hand had arrived at his tail, her fingers closed around it with a comforting pressure, and she tubed it along till reaching the end, and starting over again. After a few rounds of his premium treatment, she went for her fifth passover and as quick as a bullet Obi grappled her arm and bit her wrist. His small pin-like teeth made quick work of the skin, puncturing two holes like a vampire bite in her arm. Bruno howled two subwoofer barks, barks that would shake your insides, both low and gruff. She casted Obi aside, still careful as she didn’t want to hurt him, but efficiently enough to make him scramble off. Bruno fought the urge to chase after him, instead he tended to his master’s side. Gale quickly sat down, plopping her large rear end, with much difficulty on the tile floor. If another person had watched those events unfold, they might compare it to watching someone dressed in an inflatable costume sit down. Yet no one was there. It was just this lonely woman and her zoo of pets. A dog, a cat, a hamster, two birds both yellow-black  parakeets, and a turtle, a red eared slider she had caught years ago. Aside from these animals, she really had no one. No family to barbecue with, no friends to go camping with, and no coworkers tell juicy gossip with. She was utterly alone. This thought made her cry, soft tears at first, with the streak cutting across the pale hills of her cheeks, then they devolved into full blown sobs of grief. 

Bruno glanced up from his resting position next to his owner with eyes of empathetic grief. This bout of pure depression lasted for a while, when suddenly she had begun coughing. Not just coughing either, but hacking. Bruno stood up quickly, his simple mind running through his basic emotion checklist. Her face now turned a dark purplish red, and she had begun doing something that she hadn’t ever done before. Her closed fist of her left hand pounded against her chest with more fury than if she had gotten in a fight. Then as quickly as the fit had begun, the fit had died. Gale went limp, a glob of thick gooey drool spidered its way down to the floor, and a sharp rattle escaped from the bottom of her lungs filling Bruno’s nose with the scent of musky sea salt. Gale Whitman, age 37, seven pets, no living relatives, was now dead. Her body lay limp and lifeless, as Bruno, not yet understanding the truth of the matter burrowed his head underneath her arm, and above her forearm. In the crook that she had managed to make in her last moments. That is where he would sit for the next hour until finally being convinced that she must’ve fallen into one of her deep nightly sleeps.

Chapter 2

The feline spoke first. “Pathetic.” He muttered as he strolled lazily past Gale and Bruno who were still entangled in their respective positions. “The master doesn’t breathe you fool.” The cat chided. “Yet you still lay there hoping to hear the faintest sound of breath. Pathetic. Have you no shame?”

“Be gone cat.” Bruno barked valiantly against his murmurer. “I’ll see to it that you’ll be cast away for your murmuring. Be gone, and leave me and master to dwell together in solitude.”

The cat mewed with laughter. “As you wish, dog. However you should know that my feeding time has almost elapsed. I grow hungrier with every tick of the clock. Soon I will have to eat to survive, as will you. We shall talk then, for now however, I will leave you be.” The cat swaggered away from Bruno and Gale’s resting place, and hopped on the couch cushion with a soft thud. The cushion depressed softly under Obi’s light body weight, forcing a slight wisp of air to escape its leather cell. Soon a small rumble began to flow from the feline's chest. Obi was purring.

Bruno returned his attention to Gale. Oh sweet Gale, was she truly not breathing? Bruno’s eyes examined her chest, waiting patiently for the slight rise and fall that would indicate she was indeed alive. After a few moments of deafening silence, Bruno’s mind train arrived at the same station Obi was at. Gale was dead. If it hadn’t been for the lack of breathing, Bruno could have easily been able to derive the same conclusion from a puddle of velvet blood pooling beneath her planted face. “Dear Lord! What do we do? Without a Master we will truly starve!”

“You will starve.” The cat chirped while he picked at his claws. “I will, however, grow quite fat. I would hope you will join me, but alas I know you won’t.” Bruno glared daggers at the feline. “Glare all you will, while I feast and you famine, we’ll see who comes out of this alive.”

“You sick bastard! After all the Master has done for us you’ll see to it that she is your next meal? You make me sick! Sick!”

“Don’t grow ignorant as well as pious, you mangy little mutt. I have three human years on you. Three. Whilst you played spin in a circle to chase your own tail, I guided the Master through the depths of grief. When her mother was plucked from this life, who stood by her side and gave her the comfort she had so desperately needed? Who?”

“You.”

“That’s correct, and who chewed on their own foot while our master was barely able to keep waking from her slumber? It was you.” The last words Obi uttered shot at Bruno with the ferocity of a bullet. “It was you. So don’t you dare take the high ground on this. Have I not proven myself?”

“I guess you have. However, devouring our master is not the answer yet.”

“Then what is, canine? What is? The way I see it, I’m hungry and I see food everywhere.”

“The birds. The birds, hamster and tortoise. They will all perish before us. If we can last a few days longer, we can feast on them first! It will work!”

“Then what? What happens after we devour all the small creatures in this house?” 

“I’m not sure.”

“I’ll tell you. Two things will happen. One, you will attempt a try at my life, and when you succeed, which you will, you will have nothing that will sooth your conscious to feed on. Then we, moreover you, will move on to part two. Feasting upon the flesh of the master. The way I see it is that the only way for me to have a chance against you, is to keep up my strength. After you inevitably fail, and when you do fail it will be in my best interest to keep fast and strong. Do you see?”

“No. Alas I can’t change your mind. I will not feast upon the master as long as I can walk.”

“Count your days canine. Count your days.”

Upon the completion of their conversation, Bruno advanced to Gale's tightly packed bedroom. He did as he had always done ever since being a puppy, he slipped through the goat trail with the precision of a K-9 unit, and with a single bound, launched himself on Gale’s bed. The springs creaked their familiar song to the weight of Bruno, as the surface of the mattress softly bounced up then down. In the distant corner of the room, the sharp chirps of the parakeet’s conversation echoed from underneath the bedsheet that Gale had used to keep them quiet. “I worry! I cannot imagine a good resolution to this mishap. If the master is dead as they say, we are going to be next. We need to escape!”

“Stop, you’re going to worry yourself to death. This is stressful, that's true, but we can’t be too stressed about it or we’ll surely parish.”

“We’re already dead! We have no food, and I can guarantee that the dog won’t free us from this cage. You heard the mangy thing.”

“Yes, but be patient. We will be fine.”

“I sure hope you’re right.” With those final words the parakeet’s conversation died down and was then replaced by the soft humming of the kitchen fluorescents. The bed smelt of the salty, soggy, musk that Gale had carried with her. The smell that if asked to be described by a human, they would call it a scent of failure. A scent so distinctive that any person who knows the depths of the world's depravity could pinpoint the cause of the stench in mere seconds. This wasn’t the case for Bruno. If Bruno was asked his opinion on the subject, he would simply say that the bed smelt of Gale. 

The mattress and every stain from the chest at the foot of the bed to the headboard was simply just the nostalgia of his childhood. With the soft setting of the sun, the beams of yellow light casting themselves all over the room, the smell of Gale, the smell of youth and innocence, and the complete lack of any sort of sound made sleep easy for the tired canine. His eyes grew heavy as the curtains slowly drew close to the dread of the day. For a brief moment, as his body grew heavier he thought about how he didn’t hear the sound of thunder coming from his master. Alas however, as is the intense power of dreariness, Bruno finally fell victim to the sandman. His mind rested for the night, and Bruno simply dreamed a primal dog dream.

Chapter 3

Bruno sharply awoke to screaming from the living room. A brief shot of hope tinged his heart. Was Gale alive? Was someone here to save him? A few moments later all his questions were answered. “Let go cat! Who gave you the right to decide?”

The cat! The cat was doing something wrong. Something was very wrong. Bruno leapt from the bed, the springs squeaking behind him, as he bolted into the living room. There in the kitchen entrance lay Gale's body, unmoved aside from small tears in her fat neck. The tears were quarter sized with thick black coagulated blood thickening from the wound. If a mortician could have seen Gale's body, they would have quickly found that she had entered the state of decay so easily called Rigor Mortis. The screams continued however, and Bruno scanned the room. Suddenly they stopped, and silence engulfed the room in a heavy blanket. Bruno quickly found the source of the sound. There on the couch lay Obi, the body of a bloody small rodent resting between his paws like a lion with a sheep. “Care for a bite?” Obi asked.

Bruno lunged at Obi, the cat ducked low and leapt from the couch and on to the floor, his light footsteps patting behind him as he trailed off underneath Gale’s bed. Bruno turned back towards the body of the rodent, the pungent smell of the creature's blood, punching his stomach with the force of an atomic bomb. The whales began their cries instantaneously inside his stomach, as his intestines began swelling and shifting about. His mouth began sweating with saliva, a small stream of thick, slimy drool flooded his mouth cavity. The hunger pain refused its retreat. Instead it pushed onward, cramping Bruno’s insides, compacting the sting of stomach organs into small versions of themselves. Bruno attempted a hasty retreat, his footsteps trembling backward from the smell and towards the kitchen entrance. Suddenly the smell of fresh irony foreign blood invaded his nostrils. The smell emanated from his master's body behind him. It hadn’t smelt of rot, no, not yet, as it was too early for such an odor. No, this smell was that of a fresh kill, the smell of a fresh deer carcass that would have been dragged out of the forest and into the den of his ancestors. The smell of fresh dead meat. Bruno’s instincts were alive inside him, every muscle tingled with the desire to feast. Instead he separated himself, dragging his tempted feet back into the room.

He wasn’t starving. Not yet anyway. The smell had been enough to remind him of his lack of food, and the lack of food reignited the fire of emotions that he had been trying to push down into the depths of forgetfulness. Now the desperation and loneliness rested at the top of his mind, the reality of his situation. He knew what he had to do next, he had to find the cat. The cat did this to him, the cat was the one to blame, the cat killed his master when the cat bit her hand. The cat was a murderer! “Where did you go!?” Bruno yelped, as he shoved his maw underneath the bed of the master. “Come out here! Explain yourself!” His demands continuously fall into the depths of silence underneath the bed. 

A small voice spoke up in terror. It spoke not to him but something else in the room. It came from the corner. “Oh dear! First the hamster, now the cat! We are surely next!” Contempt brewed the rage that filled the dog's mind. The voice continued. “Oh no! He draws nearer to our home. The dog will truly kill us!”

Another voice spoke from underneath the bedsheet. “Death becomes us! We shall truly perish! I hear the claws of our reaper approaching!” The voices of blame continued their plunge into Bruno’s anger. This was the cats doing. The cat caused all the pets to turn against him! The cat is a monster!

“He’s here oh dear God! He is here! We shall be-“

“Silence! Silence you damn birds! I am not to blame for the death of the rodent! It was not I!” 

“The canine killed the master! He lies! He killed the rodent as well!” A voice hissed frightfully from underneath the bed. “Heed not his words of deceit! He would have it that we all perish so he may live!” 

“Be silent, cat! I killed no one, I’ve done no such harm to anyone!” 

“He lies!” The cat continued from underneath the bed.

The birds began their rants of terror once more. “Oh dear! He is the killer! He killed the master to have his way with the rest of us! The only protector we had is now gone!”

“Lies! Do not trust the cat! He lies!”

Suddenly a small thud in the cage caused the bars the shutter, and a voice bellowed out mourningly from underneath the sheet. “His heart! My mate is gone! He succumbed to the evil mutt's power! The dog hath killed my mate! I am truly next! Oh God! The canine makes my heart beat with the speed of a horsefly’s wings! I cannot take this, take this, take.” The same sound emitted from the cage, and the whole room grew silent. The rage continued its course inside Bruno’s cranial nerves. 

“The birds die because of you! You killed the master, what next? Will you attempt my life?”

“You’re a fool dog! The master was dying due to her own follie! Her health was failing her! She was dead before even picking me up!” 

“You lie, cat! The master died after you bit her! Why did you bite her, cat? Why?”

“I do not know. It was simply just instinct!” The fear sat in the cat's voice, never dissipating for even a second. “You are frightening me, dog. Will you kill me? Will you butcher me upon my leaving the spot I’m in?”

“I guess we’ll have to see.” The whales still spun in their circles, igniting the dull pain of hunger again in Bruno’s stomach. “I cannot kill you. However I will not sit idly by to watch you butcher my friends. The rodents death requires penance.”

“What will you do?”

“I know not. Perhaps a paw will suffice.”

“No! What happened to the other small creatures that will die before us? What happened to feasting on their corpses to preserve your own? I killed the rodent because he preemptively feasted upon the master's body! He broke the rules and I made a swift judgement!”

“Is this true? The hamster fed upon the body of the master?”

“Yes you dull headed canine! Did you not see the bite marks?”

“I did.” The calm of the air regained its foothold in Bruno’s mind, as the rage subsided. “So the hamster was a righteous killing?”

“Yes! Am I free to escape my confines?” Although Bruno didn’t believe the feline, his hunger and exhaustion forced him to relent. 

“You’re free to leave.” Bruno’s mind immediately returned to the hamster's corpse. If the hamster betrayed the master, then his body was a justifiable meal. The cat snaked out from underneath the bed and slyly stepped towards Bruno. “Am I free to eat the hamster?” 

Obi looked at Bruno with a slight tinge of irritation. “Sure.” 

Bruno quickly bounded to the execution site, launching himself onto the couch. The small rodent's body was lobbed into the air from the catapulting of the cushion. Bruno’s maw snapped at the body, the gush of blood rushing between his teeth. The small organs popped like swelled grapes between his molars, and the bones crunched and snapped with each bite. Within the same moment the corpse had been swallowed, it had satisfied the beasts in his stomach. He would gain another day before he had to eat again. Bruno jumped off the couch and ran to his refilling water bowl where he slurped water with the zeal of a man in a desert. He was satisfied for that time. The last part of the day, Bruno rested on the couch, the springs caressing his body as he slept on. Tonight Bruno would dream of awful things. Dreams so corrupted by his own situation that he would try to wake. As his mind erupted with visions of terror and violence, his body slept with complete solace.

Chapter 4

Bruno awoke, his eyes fluttering open to reveal he was in a clean version of Gale’s room. The walls were adorned with golden sunlight that engulfed the room in a bright feeling of hope. There on the side of the bed, sitting in an upright position sat Gale. Her eyes closed and her hands interlaced and rested on her sizable stomach. “Bruno. Come here boy.” Her voice was soft, yet her mouth didn’t move. It remained firmly shut. “Bru, come on boy.” Bruno stepped forward, inching closer to his deceased master. “Good boy, Bru. Why do you look so scared?” Bruno attempted speech, but the dream only permitted a small whimper to escape his mouth. “Oh Bru. It’s okay. I’m going to be fine. I love you Bru.” Suddenly the sunshine vanished, and the stacks of trash and litter began pouring in from out of the ceiling. The piles of garbage and trash returned, and the master was no longer sitting on the bed. 

At the edge of his hearing was a soft gushing sound, followed by the noise of chewing a spongy, raw meat. Bruno inched into the living room, his heart beating with the sound of a thousand drums. As he passed the corner of the hallway that led into the living room, the sound came from his left. He forced his head to turn toward the sound. There in the entryway of the kitchen lay a big fat woman covered in bite marks, cuts, and blood. In horror he watched as what used to be Gale’s body, picked up its left arm and bit into it, the teeth burrowing inches into the flesh, and tearing a large chunk of meat from its forearm. Blood watered out of the wound covering the already covered ground in more blood. 

The fat monster continued chewing and looked up at Bruno, and began muttering through the blood pouring out from its mouth, “Oh Bru, you gotta be careful love, you’ll give me a heart attack.” Just as quickly, the monster fell backwards onto the floor resuming the position it had been in since Gale had succumbed to her original injury.

Bruno awoke in a deep panic. Quickly he shot his vision to where Gale had laid, and saw she was still fully intact. It had just been a dream. That’s when he noticed that towards the left bottom of his side came a small warmth. It pulsed with breaths of deep sleep, each one rhythmically ending where another began. It was Obi. Obi rested and slept curled in a tight circle, his head tucked under his arm as he slept soundlessly. Bruno softly nudged him with his muzzle. “Cat, it’s time to wake.” The cat didn’t twitch. “Cat, awake please.” He pushed him again. This time the cat let out an inaudible sound. “Cat please.” Bruno said, pushing his muzzle harder this time.

The cat's eyes opened slightly as Bruno looked down at Obi. “The birds haven’t said a thing since those noises last night. I was also cold.” 

“No need for explanation. I understand. Are the birds gone?”

“I believe so.”

“Okay, then we should be able to get through another day.”

“When shall we feast on the birds?”

“Soon.” Bruno said, his eyes never leaving Gale’s body. “Let’s discuss something.” 

“Go ahead.” Obi said as he began standing up. 

“When the birds and the tortoise are gone, what then?”

“Then I have fulfilled my promise, and I will feast upon the master. What is your plan?”

“I’m not sure. I don’t believe I’ll be able to.” Bruno’s eyes dropped from his master’s body.

“You will have to. If you plan to survive.” 

Bruno didn’t respond, letting the harsh implications of Obi’s words dig into his mind. “I will not, and I don’t think you should either.”

“I care for you dog. I care for you, but it seems you’ve chosen death, and I cannot change that.” The cat stood up from his laying position, stretching out his front legs as he arched his back. “Well, I will leave you here. Think about what I’ve said. I beg of you.” 

After Obi finished speaking, he leapt from the couch with a soft thud, and scampered towards the room. Bruno sat on the couch, alone aside from his shadow that cast from the golden evening sun against the wall. Bruno’s eyes traced the cat, as Obi strutted away to the room. A slight tap of Obi’s footsteps followed him as he approached the door. 

Bruno listened close to the light thuds, when a loud bang suddenly erupted from the kitchen. Bruno whipped his head towards the source of the noise only to see that the kitchen fluorescents had shut off. As his eyes descended to the floor of the kitchen entryway he had noticed something was missing. The rotund grotesque body of Gale had disappeared. All that remained was a wide blood trail that traced into the kitchen. Bruno felt his neck and hind fur raise on end as his body seized with fear. 

“Cat!” Bruno barked in a puppyish yip, but there was no response. “Cat! Please!” Still nothing. The light flickered on for a brief moment, then off again. “Who’s there?!” Bruno yelped. “Who!?” A soft slapping sound, like a chunk of meat being slopped onto a cutting board, began beating rhythmically in the dark shadows. Slap, slap, slap. The sound began to grow closer to the entryway of the kitchen. Slap, slap, slap. Now adjoining the slap came a gurgling moaning noise. Slap, slap. “Who is there!?” More moaning. Suddenly a gray hand shot out of the black shadows and gripped the white tiled floor. The muscles tensed and the forearm tightened, dragging whatever sizable load was behind the shoulder, and into the light. The body that was attached to the arm was rotting away, slime and mucus poured out of open, puss ridden wounds. The face drug loosely on the ground right behind the shoulder, the voice bubbled through globs of blood and thick decaying spit. It flipped violently towards him and the couch. 

Its black eyes fluttered open and a glob of thick black liquid sputtered onto the tile. “Br-Bru.” The voice that came out sounded similar to Gale, but carried a smokers undertone. When the voice stopped, blood pooled onto the tile in a thin stream. “B-Bru, eat me. Eat me. Eat me Bru.” Suddenly a soft touch of a cat's paw brought him back. He bit frantically at the air around him, desperately trying to land a bite at the intruder. When finally he realized that he was again staring at Gale's body that sprawled out lifeless in the entryway. Bruno looked around further, finding Obi at his side. 

“Are you alright? I heard you whimpering in your sleep. Sounded like an awful dream.” Obi said as he stood idly by Bruno’s side. “Nightmare?” Bruno nodded solemnly. “I’ve been having a few myself.” Finally a sound that Bruno had been dreading had erupted, the whales unanimously cried in Bruno’s stomach signaling the onslaught of pain to follow. In the next few seconds it did. Sharp cramps shot through Bruno’s nerves and flew directly into the pain register of his brain causing him to dramatically tense up. The cat watched with mock concern. “You need to eat something, dog.”

“The birds. I eat one you eat one.” Bruno practically growled out. “Sounds fair to me.”

“Fair yes, possible no. I ate both birds while you slept last night. You had eaten the rodent so I had assumed all was fair to consume the birds.”

Shock and pain gripped tightly around Bruno’s throat. “What? How could you!?” A sharp cramp forced Bruno down into a fetal position. “I need the food. I was relying on that!” The cat simply chuckled.

“I left the damn turtle for you. Don’t get your mind so caught up in your pain! The turtle lives, but I will let you decide whose life is more valuable.”

“You’ve cheated me! I can’t kill-“ another sharp pain tore through his body. He couldn’t wait any longer. So Bruno made the call, he bound to his feet and into the hallway to the turtle’s nest. Two secure kicks sent the aquarium toppling over onto the tiled floor. The turtle, unharmed by the shards of glass, attempted to pop out of her shell and began to trek her newly discovered real estate, when Bruno’s maw snapped over her plated armor. One of his canine teeth snapped in half as it collided with the unyielding strength of the shell. The break shot a sharp nerve pain into his brain, igniting his fury even more. Three more bites reigned down on her framework, the third finally catching. The blood gushed in thick rivulets down his gums, between his teeth, and finally down his chin. 

This blood was not foreign as the rodents had been. It was familiar, even recognizable. It was his own, in his fury he had forgotten his mortality. He had forgotten the consequences of his wrath he bestowed upon the shell. He was ravenous. Finally the shell broke and fresh pink flesh became visible. For the first time since being a puppy, Bruno ate as the wolves had. Bruno ate with a savagery that only a starved coyote of the prairie could understand when presented with a meal. The meat traced its way to the empty cavern of a stomach that he had. The feeling of being able to feast for once since Gale’s accident and the incident of the mouse was pure euphoria. Pure ecstasy. 

Chapter 5

The cat rounded the corner, recoiling disgustedly from Bruno’s savagely rotted, and withered appearance. Bruno looked down, finding nothing but a clean turtle shell shaped bowl. “Satisfied?” The cat asked.

Bruno nodded solemnly as he avoided reflecting on his actions. “I needed the food.” He stumbled out. The cat nodded sympathetically.

“I totally agree. Now, back to our earlier discussion. Now that all the small creatures in the home have perished, and my hunger now outweighs my patience, I will now proceed with my own dinner. If you decide not to join me, I will not hold it against you. However I would deeply advise you to join me.” Bruno shook his head, so the cat jumped down off the couch, and strode away towards Gale’s body. Once he had arrived at the corpse, Obi jumped lightly on Gale’s head causing it to shift in the direction of Bruno. Her pale dead eyes stared blankly at him, oh Lord those used to be Gale’s light brown eyes. The eyes that could start a conversation with anyone. The type of eyes that could reflect a person’s smile. Now they stared blankly at Bruno. The light blue hue reflected back no light aside from the cloudy blur of death. 

The cat began moving quickly, he grabbed some of the cheek from the face, bit into it with his fangs, and began pulling in soft, firm tugs. Finally the cat resorted to a strong yank, and the skin gave way and tore. Blood gushed from the now open wound. It didn’t flow, as it would have if the being lived, it simply sputtered out some blood then stopped as soon as it started. When blood ceased bubbling from the wound, pearly white fat fell from inside and slipped onto the white tile. The fat slowed until Obi stepped near the wound, more fat and soft tissue spread out like toothpaste coming from a tube. Right then Bruno’s instincts took over, he almost attempted to pull away his eyes. He almost did too, but stopped dead when he noticed the mouth of the corpse, moving as if Gale was whispering. The dead blueberry lips now spotted with blood, gurgled with unwavering excitement.

 “Eat me. Eat me. Eat me. Eat me.” 

Finally Bruno cut the tension keeping his eyes glued to the dead woman’s face, when he forced his eyes to look away. The soft gushing chews of Obi enjoying his meal now filled the stale, dead, one bedroom apartment air. Bruno blocked the noise from his mind, and left the living room. He walked down the hall, his heart weighing down to his feet, and jumped onto the bed. At that moment Bruno decided that he would never leave that room. He would fight his instincts to leave even until his skin would lay like cellophane around his ribcage, even until his stomach shrank to the size of a grape then imploded due to starvation. He would stay, keeping steadfast in his commitment to his master, but more importantly to himself.

1q7lnrp,https://i.redd.it/isilivfsh6cg1.png,Tested the Mazzer Mini g for almost 2 weeks– technical observations for my home setup,"I spent about 2 weeks testing the Mazzer Mini G in my home setup, paired with my La Marzocco Linea Micra, and wanted to share some workflow- and system-level observations for anyone evaluating to buy it.
Not my best decision so far but that's reality. 


**Build & grind performance**

- Very solid, commercial-grade construction
- Grind-by-weight system is highly repeatable and accurate (±0.1 g)
- Shot-to-shot consistency is excellent once dialed in
- Burr alignment and grind consistency are exactly what you’d expect from Mazzer

From a purely mechanical and dosing-accuracy perspective, performance is excellent.


**Dial-in & retention behavior**

After seasoning (~800 g through the burrs), the following characteristics became clear:

- The grinder has a fixed internal retention of ~8 g
- This coffee remains inside the grind chamber and chute between shots
- Any bean change requires purging before adding fresh beans
- Ground coffee is really fluffy and I had to go up from 17.5g to 18.5g for the basket

Retention itself is stable, but unavoidable due to the hopper-based design


This makes the grinder predictable, but not too flexible (like all hopper-based grinders).


**Like most hopper grinders:**

- Grind size adjustments are not immediately reflected in the next grind
- It typically takes 1–2 grinds for the new setting to fully propagate

**Combined with retention, this increases waste during:**

- Dial-in
- Recipe changes
- Bean switches

This is expected behavior, but important to factor in for home users.


In my use case, it didn't match my workflow (as I should have known before buying it).

**I mostly like to:**

- Frequently change beans
- Mostly use medium to dark roasts but also want to run some lighter roasted beans
- have a clean workflow


The combination of:

- fixed internal retention
- delayed grind size response
- purging to change beans and optimally 1.5g in the morning

resulted in higher bean consumption and slower iteration than is practical for my daily home use.

None of this indicates a flaw — it’s simply a design optimized for consistency over flexibility.
And as I should have known that, not my brightest decision.


I decided to return the Mini G, not due to grind quality or build issues, but because the workflow characteristics don’t align with how we want to brew at home.

I ultimately went for the Mazzer Philos (tested his new one at a friends house a few days ago which he ordered a few days earlier than I did with my Mini g), which better supports:

- near-zero retention
- immediate grind size feedback
- rapid bean switching

while still aiming for long-term mechanical reliability.


**Summary**

**The Mazzer Mini G makes a lot of sense if:**

- You value grind-by-weight accuracy
- You run one coffee for extended periods
- You want a traditional hopper-based workflow with minimal user input
- You want to buy a extremly solid and well built grinder


For users coming from single-dosing grinders, the workflow differences are significant and worth considering carefully.

I think I'm just a ""single-dosing-guy"" who is not compatible with hopper-grinders 🫠

I've been looking for The One for fall, but I'm not quite finding a perfume that I love. Could you please recommend some fragrances based on my tastes, preferably without coconut? I'm looking for a daily cozy scent that isn't too cloying. I'm fine with unisex scents. My skin chemistry seems to love vanilla and that tends to take over scents so I like looking for scents that balance it out.

\- Mugler Aura Sensuelle: Love how green this is, just the right amount of sweetness too.

\- Phlur Cherry Stem: I love this but longevity is a problem  
\- Commodity Milk: it's nice enough but I'd like something more woody or spicy to balance it, the sweetness is a bit much.  
\- Lattafa Ana Abiyedh Scarlet: Recent discovery, love it

Top with White Chocolate Cranberry Coconut Foam (recipe below)

This started as a pretty simple holiday menu drink idea and quickly turned into an r&d nightmare because I just had to find a use for my new isi whipper lol I made and dumped so many versions of this foam before figuring it out. The recipe is at the bottom if you want to skip my rambling, but also the cocktail is pretty good even without the foam so feel free to stop reading here and just go make it without the extra headache.

SO... since it was a holiday menu and the drink leaned desserty/tropical already I wanted to make a chocolate cranberry foam to compliment it. 

I started with cocoa powder, cranberries, sugar, and water, reduced that on the stove, and whipped it with an egg white but the texture ended up being somehow chunky and watery at the same time. Next try was with xanthan gum instead of egg white but once again the texture sucked and it couldn't even dispense properly. I then did a few more versions trying almond milk instead of water, chocolate almond milk instead of cocoa powder, etc. and they just kept coming out chunky and looking like literal shit. 

I was about to give up until I saw u/KevinKos post a recipe for a hot white chocolate coconut foam on IG and took it as a sign to give it another go. So I got some coconut water and white hot chocolate powder and boiled them with some cranberries and... it turned into a disgusting curdled slop. But still I tried it one more time, breaking up each component into separate steps so I could pinpoint where exactly things were going wrong. 

Here is the long and complicated process that eventually pulled everything together:

**\~White Chocolate Cranberry Coconut Foam \~**

1000g Unsweetened Coconut Water

680g Fresh Cranberries

100g White Chocolate Powder

White Sugar

One Orange Peel

Pinch of cinnamon and salt

One egg white

Combine 1000ml Unsweetened Coconut Water, two bags (about 680g) of fresh cranberries, one orange peel strip, and a pinch each of cinnamon powder and salt in a pot and bring to a boil. 

Reduce heat and let simmer for five minutes. Allow the cranberries to pop, but don't heat for too long or they will release their pectin and start turning jammy.

Remove from heat allow the mixture 15 minutes to rest and infuse before straining out the cranberries and orange peel. 

Add the cranberry coconut water back to the pot with 100g white chocolate powder and heat on low for five minutes stirring often.

The mixture will have a mildly curdled texture at this point but the white chocolate flavour will be sufficiently infused into the liquid so now just strain the unincorporated powder a couple times through a cheesecloth as you would with a milk punch. 

Now finally just weigh the strained liquid and add half that weight in sugar and blend until smooth. 

Add to isi whipper with one egg white and charge twice, shaking vigorously between charges. For smooth dispensing, rest it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before serving. 

Anyways, just thought it would be fun to share the process. Thanks for reading. Was it worth it? Probably not for a one-night-only cocktail. But it does taste good and I feel like I accomplished something so whatever. Anxiously awaiting someone in the comments to tell me I could have just done such-and-such trick from the start and cut the process in half lol

1q7lh4q,https://i.redd.it/ton2jj84g6cg1.png,The Protein Shake Protocol: A Real‑World Demo of Atomic Habits,"
Maybe you read something about [B. F. Skinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner), or maybe you read the book [*The Power of Habit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Habit) by [Charles Duhigg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Duhigg). Both of these are incredibly interesting individuals who made the observation that we can make tremendous changes by simply providing the right stimulus at the right time. B. F. Skinner was tremendously interesting in that he was able to take animals and, in essence, program them to do things that you would think were almost impossible. Over time there was an intellectual rebellion against this approach, but in many ways his methodologies were extremely powerful and provided a good foundation for the talented science writer Charles Duhigg when he wrote his book *The Power of Habit*.

What I do want to point out is that [James Clear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clear) has modified this flow and incorporated what, academically, had really come to the forefront. There's one more step in the midst of this whole thing mainly because we're biologically wired to respond to things like dopamine and other internal signals. And he presents it in such a fashion that it becomes extremely clear.

No pun intended.

James Clear's four-step model in [*Atomic Habits*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Habits) represents a meaningful departure from both Skinner and Duhigg by explicitly reintroducing internal mental states into the habit loop: Cue → **Craving** → Response → Reward.

So you take a look at four words and they really do not mean anything, so let us dress it up a little bit and put it into a table and try to explain what is happening.

| Law / Inversion    | Principle (Good Habit) | Anti‑Principle (Break Habit) |
|:------------------ |:---------------------- |:---------------------------- |
| 1st Law (Cue)      | Make it obvious.       | Make it invisible.           |
| 2nd Law (Craving)  | Make it attractive.    | Make it unattractive.        |
| 3rd Law (Response) | Make it easy.          | Make it difficult.           |
| 4th Law (Reward)   | Make it satisfying.    | Make it unsatisfying.        |

He states, and it actually has good research behind it, that people need to have a cue that triggers a craving that drives a response that produces a reward. If you think about any change in behavior as working to change these four steps, how would you modify your morning routine?

If you read this subreddit for long, you would see that I have a suggestion to change the way that you approach your mornings. In that suggestion, you start off every day with a protein shake. Now, let us say that you have never done this before. As a matter of fact, you are wondering how to go do it. And what have you been eating? You have been eating eggs and bacon all the time. So if we wanted to think about how we want to change over, we would step through the process that Clear identifies in his book.

**Cue**

The first thing you do is make it so you do not have eggs and bacon in the refrigerator. You do not want to swing open that door and see these things sitting in your face, cueing you to grab them and cook them. On the flip side of it, you want to put all your fiber and protein ingredients in a container and put it where you cannot avoid it. You are going to see it when you open up the refrigerator door and you know it is there. Or put a great big Post-it note in the place you do your breakfast prep. You need to make it obvious.

**Crave**

The second one is more difficult. What Clear would tell you is that you need to sit there and think about all the saturated fat in your high blood level and how it is going to really hurt you if you eat that bacon and eggs. In other words, he would most likely tell you to mentally reframe it. Let me give you another alternative. Choke down the protein shake as quickly as you can. As a matter of fact, what you want to do is say, maybe I will be willing to do bacon and eggs if I can just do the protein shake first. Why is this so critical? Because at the heart of it, craving is a biological construct. And if you have a protein shake sitting in your stomach, your desire to go gorge on bacon and eggs is going to go down. In other words, if you have to show up at McDonald's with a bunch of friends and you know they are all going to have Egg McMuffins, make sure you walk in so you are not hungry. In this case, it is basically a race to fill your stomach, and if you can fill it immediately with a protein shake, that biological drive is going to be satiated by the fact that you already have something there, which fixes the craving.

**Response**

You got the que, you got the craving, now you actually got to go do something. And the point is, the easier it is to do, the quicker you're actually going to have a response.

You want to make this response really easy. Everything is inside a container, so when you wake up and you are stumbling around, you stumble over, take the top off the container, and pour it in while mixing it. You want to make this easy and faster than the alternative of sitting down and doing bacon and eggs. On the flip side of this, you actually want to try to remove the bacon and eggs. Ideally you would not even have them in the refrigerator, and if you really wanted them you would need to go down to the grocery store. The last thing that you want to do is have them sitting there “just in case.” The moment that they become easy to access, you decrease your chance of being successful.

**Reward**

The fourth one is reward, and in this case, let us go ahead and put together another table that talks about the different rewards you could give yourself.

| Reward Strategy      | Description                                         | Example Application                                            |
|:-                    |:-                                                  |:-                                                              |
| Immediate Rewards    | Pair the habit with instant pleasure for a dopamine boost. | Enjoy dark chocolate or herbal tea right after the drink.      |
| Temptation Bundling  | Link the habit to a desirable activity you crave.  | Listen to a favorite podcast only while sipping the drink.     |
| Habit Tracking       | Visualize progress with a streak tracker for accomplishment. | Mark daily completion in Obsidian and celebrate 7-day streaks with running gear. |
| Celebration Rituals  | End with a feel-good ritual to reinforce satisfaction. | Strike a victory pose or journal a quick win note.             |

There is nothing necessarily mind-blowing about this, and if you sat down for a moment and thought about it naturally, you would probably say, I am going to put this here where I cannot ignore it, and if I eat this first, I am not going to eat the other stuff. You probably have a pretty good idea that you want to make it difficult to eat bacon and eggs, and you may even understand that having a little treat after taking the stuff you do not like is a pretty good idea. 

The difference is that if you have the check-off list, you go through the check-off list, and clicking through the check-off list just makes it immensely more executable.

Now, Clear calls out something that is really interesting. He talks about something that they do in Japan that you would not necessarily think is effective.

Japanese train operators use a safety ritual called Pointing and Calling, which is a classic example of [operant conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning) in action. They physically point at signals, speedometers, and timetables while verbalizing each detail aloud (“Signal is green,” “Speed is 80 km/h”). Platform staff point along the edge and declare “All clear!” before departure. This dramatically reduces accidents. It turns out that talking to yourself, talking things through, creates change. Do not be shy about talking to yourself or talking out loud. It is an amazing way of having something stick inside your brain.

So in the morning, you walk into the kitchen and say, ""that protein shake is obvious."" Then you say, ""that protein shake was filling."" After you mix it, you say, ""that was really fast compared to doing bacon and eggs."" And then finally, after you are all done, which is actually what I do, you have your favorite tea or coffee. And you are like, ""boy, I love my green tea with pomegranate juice, or I love my coffee with milk and sugar in it."" 

A bit corny? The answer is yes. 
Is it effective? The answer is yes.

In many ways, this is just understanding how to program your mind. And Clear does a tremendous job of pointing out how to do this.

I invite you to not read across this and dismiss it. If you're thinking about changing a habit, take the four steps above and just do a reply to the OP. I mentioned fiber drinks, but it could be many things. It could be having a relationship with your spouse. It could be working out. It could be sleep. The point is there is something that you would like to do. And one of the most important things you can do is write down these four steps and then go ahead and post it somewhere.

1q7lgkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1q7lgkz/temps_at_other_cafes_not_hot/,Temps at other cafes not hot?,"It's been a few years since I was a barista but I've been noticing that when I go to a lot of other cafes, even coffee roasters, that my latte isn't actually hot. It's warm at best and then cold within like 20 minutes. These aren't during busy hours, so I know they are pulling fresh shots each time (implying cooled down shots aren't ruining the drink). 

When I was a barista we steamed our milk to a standard 150 F, and if customers asked for ""extra hot"" we'd go to about 160, but no hotter because then it'd scald the milk. I remember my managers always scoffed afterward and would say ""people are weird about liking their scalded bad quality lattes"" but now I'm honestly considering being one of those customers because I swear the lattes aren't even hot! But I don't want to accidentally receive a scalded drink. Because there IS a difference. But I feel like asking them to ensure the temps reach 150 F is being way too high maintenance. 

Anyone noticing this anywhere else? Or is this a new norm I'm not aware of to get a better froth texture? 

I've had this issue at probably 5 cafes now. None of which are chain. All craft coffee houses. ",2,1767900708.0,barista,9,0.75,False

1q7lgew,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q7lgew,"In-Hand Review: Stussy Dice Knit is a 10/10, but mixed feelings on the CH Jeans 🎲 (ft. Supreme, Nike, Amiri)","1. Chrome Hearts Multi-Color Cross Trucker Hat**

**Rating:** 7/10
**Review:** It’s a loud piece. The colors on the crosses are vibrant, and the mesh quality is standard—breathable and decent for hot weather. However, the print on the foam front feels a little plasticky, like it might crack or peel after a summer of wear. The silver button on top is a nice detail, but overall it feels a bit lightweight compared to other CH caps I’ve handled.
**Fit:** Standard snapback fit. Sits a bit high on the head.

### **2. New Era NY Yankees Fitted (Side Patch)**

**Rating:** 9/10
**Review:** Can’t go wrong with a classic. The embroidery on the NY logo and the side patch is super clean—no loose threads or connected stitching. The brim came with a standard flat shape but curved easily. The wool blend feels structured and durable. Not much to complain about here, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
**Fit:** True to size. Fits my head shape perfectly without pinching.

### **3. Nike Tech Fleece Jacket (Grey/Black)**

**Rating:** 8/10
**Review:** The color blocking on this is sick, gives it a more aggressive look than the solid grey ones. Material is smooth and comfortable, standard Tech Fleece quality. My only gripe is the main zipper; it feels a little stiff and catches slightly near the bottom. Hopefully, it loosens up with wear.
**Fit:** Fits slim. At 180cm, the Medium is a perfect fitted look, but if you want to layer a hoodie underneath, you might struggle. Length is spot on.

### **4. Chrome Hearts Black Tonal Cross Jeans**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** These are way more wearable than the blue ones (see #6). The black-on-black patches are subtle and the leather crosses feel decent quality. The denim itself is heavy and rigid, which I like. The buttonhole was incredibly tight, had to fight it to get them open the first time. The wash looks authentic.
**Fit:** Waist is TTS. The length stacks nicely on my Jordans without dragging on the floor.

### **5. Supreme Box Logo Hoodie (Black)**

**Rating:** 7.5/10
**Review:** The blank on this is heavy and stiff—definitely a winter hoodie. The box logo embroidery is centered and straight, no floating 'e'. However, the neck hole is surprisingly tight/small. It’s a struggle to get my head through without messing up my hair. It’s a classic piece, but the comfort isn’t 10/10 due to the stiffness.
**Fit:** Boxy fit. Sleeves are a tiny bit short for my arms (180cm), but the chest is roomy.

### **6. Chrome Hearts Blue Patch Jeans**

**Rating:** 5/10
**Review:** Honestly, not feeling these as much in hand. The craftsmanship is fine, but the design is just too loud in person. The ""CHROME HEARTS"" text across the back is huge and the blue leather patches contrast too much for daily wear. The denim feels slightly thinner than the black pair (#4) as well. Hard to style without looking like a walking billboard.
**Fit:** Fits same as the black pair, straight leg cut.

### **7. Stussy Dice Knit Sweater**

**Rating:** 9.5/10
**Review:** Favorite item of the haul. The knit is surprisingly soft and not itchy at all against bare skin. The dice graphic is woven in clearly, not just printed on top. It has a nice weight to it and drapes really well. Feels like a quality garment that will last a long time.
**Fit:** Slightly oversized/relaxed. The perfect baggy fit for my build.

### **8. Amiri ""Imagination"" Hoodie**

**Rating:** 6/10
**Review:** A bit disappointed with this one. For an ""Amiri"" piece, the blank feels kinda thin and flimsy compared to the Supreme or Carhartt hoodies. The print is okay, but it feels like it might fade after a few washes. It looks cool, but the quality doesn't match the aesthetic. It feels more like a fast-fashion hoodie than a luxury rep.
**Fit:** Fits slightly cropped and wide.

### **9. Carhartt WIP Embroidered Hoodie (Cream)**

**Rating:** 10/10
**Review:** Best bang for your buck. The cream color is beautiful in person (though I’m terrified of spilling coffee on it). The ""Carhartt"" embroidery is thick and premium. The fleece lining is super soft. It’s simple, clean, and feels indestructible.
**Fit:** TTS. Not too boxy, not too slim. Sleeves hit perfectly at the wrist.

### **10. Stussy Arch Logo Hoodie (Black/Yellow)**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** Another solid Stussy piece. The yellow text pops really nicely against the black. The logo is a chenille-style texture which adds some nice depth. It’s a good daily driver hoodie. Cuffs are nice and tight, holding the sleeves up well.
**Fit:** Fits similar to the Carhartt one, maybe a little looser in the chest area. Ideal for a relaxed street fit.

1q7lg1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/1q7lg1c/himym_inspired_wedding_book_looking_for_chapter/,HIMYM inspired wedding book. Looking for chapter ideas,"Hi everyone,

I’m creating a wedding gift inspired by How I Met Your Mother and would love some input from fellow fans.

The idea is a text based coffee table book that focuses on the storytelling and warmth of the show rather than memes or screenshots.

So far I have the following chapters:

	•	A Playbook inspired section with different “plays,” including one written like The Robin that outlines how the groom proposed and another play about how they first got into a relationship.

	•	A “How I Met You” chapter where every guest writes a short piece about how they met the couple.

	•	A Bro Code inspired section with meaningful and funny stories from the friend group.

The HIMYM theme feels meaningful because the groom is a big fan and I am a fan as well, which is why I once gave them a French blue horn when they moved in together. What matters most to me is that the book shows genuine appreciation and love, rather than relying on jokes or pictures.

They also love HIMYM games and I am curious if there is a subtle way to translate that into a written format.

Any ideas for additional chapters or deep cut references would be very welcome. Thanks in advance.",6,1767900676.0,HIMYM,7,1.0,False

I'm going to assume the Holidays may have caused this delay.

I usually only buy 5LB bags and freeze most of it until I am ready.

When I'm buying fresh beans from a roaster. I'm hoping the roast date is just a few days off or a week max. 

The regular price for a 5LB bag from the roaster is $150 CAD, but I got it on sale for $110 CAD. The coffee beans aren't even single orgin. It's the roasters own blend. 

I think for the premium I am paying for coffee beans. The roast date should be max 1 week out. 

If I'm going to Costco and buying coffee beans. I don't care about the roast date.

1q7le8t,https://i.redd.it/wt9hypdke6cg1.png,Review: 3Dfy Steam Lever for Gaggia Classic Pro,"If you’ve owned a Gaggia Classic Pro for a while (or have even considered buying one for a bit), it’s clear what the machine does exceptionally well, as well as what the machine does relatively poorly. I’ve always liked to think of it as the “Volkswagen Beetle” of espresso machines, given its low relative cost, generally good reliability (with proper maintenance), and the ability to get around any of the machine’s negative superlatives with a bit of modification and improv skills.

Shots pulling too fast? Just replace that 12-bar OPV spring to a 9-bar. Can’t fit an espresso scale and mug under the portafilter? Use a low-profile drip tray instead. Milk not steaming to your liking? Replace the tip with one using a single vent hole. The list goes on and on. 

It should be no surprise then that for most owners, one of the most annoying aspects of using one of these is trying to turn the machine’s steam valve. It feels cheap, and plasticky, and because it’s so difficult to grip, it can be really annoying to use. There’s really no middle ground between feeling like you’re not turning it hard enough to close it, and turning it so hard that it feels like you’re breaking it. This goes double if you’re not used to having to cross your non-dominant hand over your dominant one to operate it while the other holds the milk jug. It’s easily the most cumbersome part of operating the machine, at least for me. 

This valve is replaceable of course, but usually this means you will have to go into your machine and manually install it yourself. Given that the amount of work in that was enough of a turn-off for me to avoid it for the first three years I’ve had one of these, I did what any sensible Gaggia owner would do - I tied a bunch of rubber bands around the handle for additional grip while turning. But what if there was a better way?

Enter the GCP Steam Lever. Quite like any other peripheral in this space, it’s not sold by a large brand or corporate coffee peripheral company - it’s found on an Etsy page based in Canada, and is only possible because some guy with a 3D printer thought some of us would be interested in buying one. 

What does it do? It fits flush over your Gaggia’s stock steam valve, allowing you to turn it with a screw-in lever poking out from over the top - all with a completely tool-free installation. I’d always thought these levers were a bit gimmicky, and something that was designed more for the visual aesthetic than any kind of practical use case. 

BOY was I wrong. 

First off, the fact that it’s a 3D-printed part means that it will fit perfectly flush over the valve. There’s no need for any adhesives, tighteners, or even the handle screw to keep it in place. It just fits right over the valve, no wider and no narrower than what it exactly has to be to grip it perfectly. 

Thanks to this (and your newfound ability to control that valve with a lever), it offers an incredible amount of mechanical advantage. This part taught me that I genuinely underestimated the Gaggia’s ability to steam milk properly - even those few split seconds it takes to readjust your hand once or twice to complete the turn makes a massive difference in getting the whirlpool going. It’s not just that it’s more comfortable and less awkward to use (and don’t get me wrong, it’s very much BOTH of those things) - the control is just simply unmatched and your results should improve dramatically right away.

Secondly, it comes in three colorways - allowing you to keep it from clashing with any other peripheral items in your machine’s setup. It doesn't show as well in the picture, but the part itself is genuinely well-designed from a 3D-modeling standpoint. It feels unibody and sturdy, made from quality filament dense enough for everyday use without cracking, breaking, or wearing down. The front, textured part of the circle honestly feels more like a high-quality injection-molded plastic than a 3D-printed part. 

Finally - this tool can be used for some lo-fi shot hacking. I don’t know if there’s a more eloquent name for this somewhere else on the net, but I’ve started using this device for a technique I’ve been calling “flow surfing” - which has itself made a huge difference in my shot consistency. A few years ago, some folks realized you can open the steam valve while the pump is running for the first few seconds to simulate pre-infusion, but with this device, the amount of granular control you have over the valve lets you barely pull it open or gently tap it closed - allowing you to slightly cut the flow rate in a shot that’s pulling too fast. By just remembering a few pairs of numbers to gauge the shot length vs. mass, I can now always roughly pull a 32g shot in 24-26 seconds.

The level of versatility and practicality here is genuinely amazing. I haven’t bought a single peripheral in my setup that’s improved my output this much since I invested in a WDT tool about a month after I bought the machine. It’s seriously just that good.

But what about the bad parts? I can honestly only think of one, and it’s the same problem you’re going to face if you get any kind of peripheral for the valve - having to buy it via Etsy. Now to be fair, this isn’t a shot at the seller at all - he responded within minutes to my messages, and even changed my delivery address after I placed the order to ensure I received it properly. The issue here appears to be Etsy itself - because I ordered this product in early December and it took almost literally a month to get to my home in the U.S. This honestly could have also been an issue with shipping around the holidays - but in the era of Amazon Prime, I figured it would be worth calling out that there’s no way to get something like this quickly. 

It’s currently on sale for 20% off for the next three days at just under $25 instead of $31 - and to be perfectly honest with you, I think that’s a steal. It’s not just a piece of plastic you hook up to the side of your machine - it’s a quality, 3D-printed part made by an enthusiast who knows the audience he’s selling to. For someone with a virtual monopoly on a product like this, I can say confidently that this lever is exceptional, and I don’t feel like he remotely overcharged me for what this thing is and what it can do.

If you’re on the fence about getting one - just buy it. By the time it’s delivered, you’ll probably have changed your mind back and forth about four times before you can try it and see the results for yourself. 

**TL;DR - This peripheral allows you to complete a tool-free replacement of your stock GCP steam valve. Not only does it improve milk steaming and ergonomics, but allows you to have enough control to manually adjust the flow rate of the pump to dial in your shots as you pull them. Only downside is the long shipping time - customer service is great and it's on sale for the next few days. Buy one!**

- Filled the icetray (and my water bottle)
- Thoroughly Cleaned the BR toilet and sink (which was terrible btw)
- Made coffee and oatmeal
- Cleaned the sink, stove and counters

- Ordered groceries
- Dried my hair and styled it
- Swept the kitchen and dining room floor
- Cleaned and swept my room
- Hung up my clothes from yesterdays launder
- Cleaned out the fridge & Put new groceries in

Talk me out of it?,"So hear me out. My family does the same beach trip every year. Two weeks, usually somewhere on the Gulf Coast. Between hotels, resort fees, parking, all that garbage - we're easily dropping $8-10k just on accommodation.

Did the math yesterday and realized we've spent like $80k on hotels over the last decade. For what? Someone else's property that I have zero control over.

Started looking at actual properties in the $400-600k range. If I finance it and offset costs by renting it out when we're not using it, the numbers kinda work? Plus I'd actually have a place that's MINE. Same pillows every time. My coffee maker. No weird stains I'm afraid to investigate.

My wife thinks I'm crazy. Says it's ""not liquid"" and we'll be stuck dealing with maintenance and renters and hurricanes and whatever else. She's probably right but also... that $80k is already gone and we have nothing to show for it.

Scene / Concept:  
A hyper-realistic surreal scene of a vintage typewriter on a modern desk beside a laptop and coffee cup. From the moving keys rises a miniature early-1900s city street: brick storefronts, glowing shop windows, bicycles, and pedestrians in period clothing. Each typed letter physically becomes part of the world: commas form street lamps, paper turns into sidewalks, ink flows as shadowy rivers. Tiny figures walk carefully between the keys. Smoke drifts from typed chimneys. The typewriter builds places instead of words. Mood: warm, nostalgic, quietly magical. Core message: *Some machines once told stories with their hands.*

Camera / Motion (8s):

* Slow, cinematic pan from front of typewriter to miniature street.
* Slight overhead tilt showing tiny figures walking between keys.
* Subtle dolly effect along the flowing streets and sidewalks forming from paper.
* Soft parallax shift: foreground (typewriter keys) slightly in focus, background city miniature gradually coming into view.

Visual Style:

* Cinematic surreal realism, macro detail, shallow depth of field.
* Soft, warm light illuminating keys and miniature streets.
* Ultra-detailed textures: paper, ink, brick, cobblestone, tiny figures.
* Subtle motion: smoke rising from chimneys, gentle ripples in ink-rivers.

Technical Specs:

* Duration: 8 seconds.
* Resolution: 4K or 8K if supported.
* Frame rate: 24–30 FPS cinematic.
* Lighting: warm, cozy, golden-hour inspired.

I've been married for 12 years 33f husband is 37 and we have 2 kids daughter 6 son 5 months. Are marriage was never perfect but we were ok. About 5 years ago things changed. My husband started going through alot of stress and it effected our relationship. But I never stopped being there for him and helping out. We've always done 50/50 and I don't spend his money. I have a good job and spend on myself the kids and him. Things started changing when he started sleeping in the basement .... he would always go out which I was fine with but it felt like the past 4 years I've been alone. He would work late or hangout with friends basically every night then would come home after 1 am and would watch TV in the basement. He would tell me I can't sleep etc. Are life started to go done from there maybe sex once a month to then he didn't touch me for 8 months. I told myself its stress I dont want to put pressure on him. I want to mention I take care of this man dinner,breakfast,  lunch coffee, evening snacks, laundry everything. I would try to talk to him and understand what he was going through but he wouldn't want to really talk about it. Over the past 4 years we have been intamit maybe 10 times. He kisses me in the morning and before he goes to his basement and maybe a hug hear and there... no making out no major cuddles nothing. Yes your thinking he is cheating.... I thought so but I couldn't fine anything I know where he is 24/7 he calls me all day. We have become romemates and im his mom basically. 

Last year I got pregnant I was terrified and in denial, but it happened. I have perfect pregnancies and basically dont look or feel pregnant till around 7 months. He didn't touch me , never helped me, never spoiled me. I also want to mention I take care of myself hair, make up, body. He basically wakes up seeing me looking good. Even post baby I bounced back pretty quickly and was ready to have sex in 6 weeks. But he didn't even mention is or ask. So I finally sat him down and asked him what the problem was with our marriage. He said he thought we were good..... I told him we have a sexless marriage and we barly talk and im in my prime and need attention, sex, and to feel loved. He basically blamed his stress and work and said he will try. Well ee did have sex maybe 2 weeks later and it was horrible maybe 5 mins didn't really do anything for me but kissed me alot told me he loved me and missed me.  Now almost 3 months later .... still nothing. The reason I'm asking reddit is yesterday I relalised something I was taking a shower and my husband always open the shower when im in it and looks and me and says hi or kinda giggles. Yesterday he did it twice saw my naked body that he hasent seen in forever and didn't do anything.

I'm excited to form an online running club and forum to link up with other early-morning risers who get miles in before the rest of the world wakes. This is a community where we ask questions, encourage one another, offer motivation, share upcoming races and training plans, and just chat about life. My vision is for Breakfast Miles to combine the Reddit forum with a Strava running group to build the community, and for Breakfast Miles to evolve from solely virtual to eventually in-person pop-ups, race sponsorships, morning miles followed by breakfast/coffee meet ups all over the country.

I'm 31 and have been running my entire life in some form or fashion. I played many sports growing up (basketball, football, tennis, baseball) but didn't seriously start running until high school track where I ran 400's and 800's. I was never a distance runner. I got into Crossfit after college and unfortunately during an event in 2023, ruptured my left pec which left me hanging up my Crossfit aspirations and diving back into running. I now primarily run and do HIIT/Hyrox training. I completed my first marathon in 2024 and have since run a number of half marathons, trail races, ultra relays, and Hyroxes.

I'm married with 4 kids and work in corporate finance, so I get my miles in early in the morning. I'm excited to establish a community of other driven runners who don't let kids, aging, corporate jobs, etc. become an excuse!

Thanks for being part of the very first wave. Together, let's make r/BreakfastMilesRunning amazing. I'd love to hear about you and what your goals for 2026 are!",1,1767900014.0,BreakfastMilesRunning,0,1.0,False

We have 2 kids, 11 and 13 each with their own bedroom. We live in a modest sized three bedroom home and have no guest bedroom. Growing up in the Midwest, it was not unusual that when my grandparents came into town, I was to give up my bedroom for them. This was understandable since I was a child and could make do on the couch. However, it was completely unheard of in my family for the master bedroom to be given over to the elders as it was the marital bedroom, so my parents always kept their room.


As an adult I expect my room to remain mine, with the exception of a sick child needing cuddles. This appears to be different for my partner and her parents. 

My inlaws live approximately 2 hours away, and when they come into town, it is expected that we give up our bedroom for them. This has always bothered me. They have more than enough funds, but even if they did not, I would gladly pay for a hotel room or give them our 11 year old's bedroom (full sized bed which they are used to) if they wish to stay with us. I have mentioned this to my partner, but she insists that the only acceptable way is for them to have our room and that the 11 year cannot be expected to give up their room.  This led to a bit of an argument because if they stay in our room that means we have to sleep in the living room on a pallet and get woken up at 7  in the morning when her Mother wakes up(making coffee and all manner of noise in the kitchen), which I can't stand, but she finds acceptable.

Log Cabin - The city's go-to Sunday morning brunch spot (mostly because Broadway Diner is tiny and hard to get into on Sunday morning). Baker's Square-style pies. Rustic building and decor. Super-friendly staff. [https://www.logcabin-baraboo.com/](https://www.logcabin-baraboo.com/)

Dinner:

Baraboo Burger Co. - Probably the place I hear recommended the most for dinner. Right on the square, nice typical sports-bar setup, but also an AMAZING burger menu. And massive sides and apps. [https://www.barabooburgercompany.com/gallery](https://www.barabooburgercompany.com/gallery) (If they're too busy, Square Tavern right next door or Brothers on Oak are decent bars with decent food as well.)

Little Village Cafe - Don't let the name fool you, they don't open until 11am. And don't let the quaint interior fool you, they have a fresh and upscale menu with local small-town pricing. (Ok, the deserts are a little pricey, but they are SUPERB.) [https://www.littlevillagecafe.com/](https://www.littlevillagecafe.com/)

Gem City Saloon & Eatery - they have lots of great options, but most locals go here for the pizza. Sausage the size of golf balls. [https://gemcitysaloon.com/](https://gemcitysaloon.com/)

Mama Mia - humble shop with authentic fresh-made Italian food and the most unique and deliciously pillowy garlic rolls you'll ever eat. [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100041322834375](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100041322834375)

\*\*Bonus - Tumbled Rock Brewery - yeah, its a brewery, but they also happen to serve super delicious high-end food here. 

Drinks:

Al. Ringling Brewery - located in the historic Ringling Mansion, that in and of itself is a reason to visit. To top it off, they have an excellent repertoire of house-made and local-made brews. [https://alringlingbrewing.com/](https://alringlingbrewing.com/)

Driftless Glen Distillery - Their food is good, my husband and BIL say the drinks are good, and friends say the tour is really nice. Classy building right down on the riverfront and next to Circus World. [https://driftlessglen.com/](https://driftlessglen.com/)

Balanced Rock Winery - Featuring beautiful views, live music, and a great lineup of house-made and local wines. I LOVE this place, but I will say the metal vaulted interior makes the inside a bit loud... definitely go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside and enjoy the bluffs! [https://www.balancedrockwinery.com/](https://www.balancedrockwinery.com/)

Tumbled Rock Brewery - An innovative and frequently updated brew list (recently hubby and I tried their S'mores Porter which was MAGICAL and I don't even like porters), PLUS a really fabulous outdoor turf patio with frequent live music. (Also excellent food, as mentioned above) [https://tumbledrock.com/](https://tumbledrock.com/)

1q7l1g9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ALSorNOT/comments/1q7l1g9/new_bulbar_symptomsthoughts/,"New bulbar symptoms,thoughts","Hello everyone. This is my final post. I have decided to delete this app along with other social media .If anyone is interested you can read my previous posts about the many symptoms of mine since 1.5 years ago. 
 The new ones are hypersalivation,more facial twitching,especially in cheeks(very subtle) ,biting my inner cheeks and tongue ,clicking sound when I shallow water,often re adjusting my larynx and a pain around my left knee(and sometimes left hip or other parts of that leg ) that has turned  almost constant. Also the random pains in hands fingers etc continue ever since the start of it all. Sometimes I feel out of breath as well and have kinda choked and coughed on some occasions. I have had silent gerd and stomach, gut problems since my kid or teenage years  so I fear that I was somewhat predisposed genetically for this disease and that now my vagal nerve is the first to be so heavily impacted.I guess the most weird one is remembering old dreams daily I have had ,even ones ten years ago. Limbs falling alseep and tingly easily is another one.
 As I havent had an full emg yet ,I have decided to wait another two months until I see a neuro specialist for these cases that I found. Unless a more obvious weakness sets in before that time. I dont seek re-assurance as it doesn't last long when I get it. I would just rather spend two months more not knowing and I believe 7 months after the first twitch I noticed would be enough time to reveal it.
I fear gut bacteria,as some theories say,have done the bad job in my case. This is why it isnt really ibs(no constipation or diarrhea)what I have,just change in daily bowel movements and being more sensitive in some foods. This sub type could also explain my palpitations since last January. If this is to be true I guess my disease is very slow until now at least. Twitching in all of my muscles ,throat and mouth problems,knee discomfort are what trouble my mind more and are daily/constant. Also read that some neurodivergent people are more prone to get bad neuro diseases and although not diagnosed I believe im in the spectrum ,functional but very introvert,shy,social anxiety etc. 
I know that chronic stress and hypervigilance could explain some of my symptoms but its just too many of incidents and symptoms to happen one after another,especially since this summer. I hope that Im stuck in fight or flight mode ,this is my only hope actually.I have many other symptoms which now I cant even remember,being easily startled also worries me but this one has become more mild lately. I intend to try some antidepressants for this two-months period(my neuro suggested it as b12 injections and clonotil didn't do anything) so at least my stress levels could be lowered as well as stopping coffee and cola etc.
I have noticed that under a lot of stress I do twitch more or at least I feel them more. But then again I read that umn predominant*** can cause hyperexcitability so I guess stress/panic could only amplify the feeling more. 
Also if anyone thinks Im in a bad place and has read a lot( like Dimitar) ,he/she could tell me so ,I dont mind anymore ,being scared has given its place to other thoughts.
I guess that this disease could happen to me in a later stage but not taking care of my daily life and health  triggered it sooner. I will not come back with an update whatever the result ,Im not saying im 100 percent sure I have it but I wouldnt want to scare anyone cause I guess I would be an atypical-more or less- case.
Anyway ,take care eveyone, especially of your mental and physical health. These are just my thoughts,I'm not even half sure about what I write. I hate medical field stuff and dont want to read about them any more I regret doing so,lol.  I prefer maths and history,lol again.

1q7l1c2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q7l1c2,"In-Hand Review: Stussy Dice Knit is a 10/10, but mixed feelings on the CH Jeans 🎲 (ft. Supreme, Nike, Amiri)","1. Chrome Hearts Multi-Color Cross Trucker Hat**

**Rating:** 7/10
**Review:** It’s a loud piece. The colors on the crosses are vibrant, and the mesh quality is standard—breathable and decent for hot weather. However, the print on the foam front feels a little plasticky, like it might crack or peel after a summer of wear. The silver button on top is a nice detail, but overall it feels a bit lightweight compared to other CH caps I’ve handled.
**Fit:** Standard snapback fit. Sits a bit high on the head.

### **2. New Era NY Yankees Fitted (Side Patch)**

**Rating:** 9/10
**Review:** Can’t go wrong with a classic. The embroidery on the NY logo and the side patch is super clean—no loose threads or connected stitching. The brim came with a standard flat shape but curved easily. The wool blend feels structured and durable. Not much to complain about here, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
**Fit:** True to size. Fits my head shape perfectly without pinching.

### **3. Nike Tech Fleece Jacket (Grey/Black)**

**Rating:** 8/10
**Review:** The color blocking on this is sick, gives it a more aggressive look than the solid grey ones. Material is smooth and comfortable, standard Tech Fleece quality. My only gripe is the main zipper; it feels a little stiff and catches slightly near the bottom. Hopefully, it loosens up with wear.
**Fit:** Fits slim. At 180cm, the Medium is a perfect fitted look, but if you want to layer a hoodie underneath, you might struggle. Length is spot on.

### **4. Chrome Hearts Black Tonal Cross Jeans**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** These are way more wearable than the blue ones (see #6). The black-on-black patches are subtle and the leather crosses feel decent quality. The denim itself is heavy and rigid, which I like. The buttonhole was incredibly tight, had to fight it to get them open the first time. The wash looks authentic.
**Fit:** Waist is TTS. The length stacks nicely on my Jordans without dragging on the floor.

### **5. Supreme Box Logo Hoodie (Black)**

**Rating:** 7.5/10
**Review:** The blank on this is heavy and stiff—definitely a winter hoodie. The box logo embroidery is centered and straight, no floating 'e'. However, the neck hole is surprisingly tight/small. It’s a struggle to get my head through without messing up my hair. It’s a classic piece, but the comfort isn’t 10/10 due to the stiffness.
**Fit:** Boxy fit. Sleeves are a tiny bit short for my arms (180cm), but the chest is roomy.

### **6. Chrome Hearts Blue Patch Jeans**

**Rating:** 5/10
**Review:** Honestly, not feeling these as much in hand. The craftsmanship is fine, but the design is just too loud in person. The ""CHROME HEARTS"" text across the back is huge and the blue leather patches contrast too much for daily wear. The denim feels slightly thinner than the black pair (#4) as well. Hard to style without looking like a walking billboard.
**Fit:** Fits same as the black pair, straight leg cut.

### **7. Stussy Dice Knit Sweater**

**Rating:** 9.5/10
**Review:** Favorite item of the haul. The knit is surprisingly soft and not itchy at all against bare skin. The dice graphic is woven in clearly, not just printed on top. It has a nice weight to it and drapes really well. Feels like a quality garment that will last a long time.
**Fit:** Slightly oversized/relaxed. The perfect baggy fit for my build.

### **8. Amiri ""Imagination"" Hoodie**

**Rating:** 6/10
**Review:** A bit disappointed with this one. For an ""Amiri"" piece, the blank feels kinda thin and flimsy compared to the Supreme or Carhartt hoodies. The print is okay, but it feels like it might fade after a few washes. It looks cool, but the quality doesn't match the aesthetic. It feels more like a fast-fashion hoodie than a luxury rep.
**Fit:** Fits slightly cropped and wide.

### **9. Carhartt WIP Embroidered Hoodie (Cream)**

**Rating:** 10/10
**Review:** Best bang for your buck. The cream color is beautiful in person (though I’m terrified of spilling coffee on it). The ""Carhartt"" embroidery is thick and premium. The fleece lining is super soft. It’s simple, clean, and feels indestructible.
**Fit:** TTS. Not too boxy, not too slim. Sleeves hit perfectly at the wrist.

### **10. Stussy Arch Logo Hoodie (Black/Yellow)**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** Another solid Stussy piece. The yellow text pops really nicely against the black. The logo is a chenille-style texture which adds some nice depth. It’s a good daily driver hoodie. Cuffs are nice and tight, holding the sleeves up well.
**Fit:** Fits similar to the Carhartt one, maybe a little looser in the chest area. Ideal for a relaxed street fit.

I’ll start with the **tips** first:

1. Eat slowly, so so slowly. I set a timer for 15 minutes for eating the morning prolon fasting bar. 

How? I would eat slowly, check the timer, and then stop eating for a few minutes and continue. By day 3, the slow eating pace became routine. Same for the soups, I set a time for 20 minutes. 

\*bonus: serve yourself in a nice soup bowl. a beautiful mug for the herbal tea was also nice. 

2. If you’re using the kit, I found that cooking the soups on stovetop is better. In the expanded variety pack, there’s a lentil soup and a pea soup (e.g. dried lentil and dried peas) that needs extended cooking time/ soaking time. I added an extra 1/4 cup of water. 

If you do microwave, let the soup sit longer while hot to rehydrate. 

3. Highly recommend walking outdoors 15-30mins +, it was a great happiness boost! I took an 1+ outdoor walk everyday (except for day 4). Otherwise, a 30-60 minute indoor/treadmill walk. No issues with low energy for me. 

**Now to the kit:**

Prolon soups - I did not enjoy a majority of them. By day 3, the soups made me nauseous. So on D4 and D5, I used organic canned soups to replace the 2- soups a day in the Prolon kit.

Prolon fasting bars - excellent! I ordered more and plan to have this first thing in the morning with my coffee, extending myIF window.

Prolon chocolate shake - I do not wish their shakes on anyone. Thankfully there’s on 1 - chocolate shake in day 1. 

Olive oil, glycerin, vitamin and supplements: all okay. I took them all according to the plan. 

**Overall** 

Throughout the 5 days, I did not experience hunger. I have done extended (5+ days) water fasts before, so having something to eat everyday was effective in keeping hunger feelings at bay. I have also been doing IF 16:8 for over 6 months, and occasionally do OMAD for a period of 1-2 weeks at a time. 

I enjoy experimenting on myself (n=1), lol.

Before starting FMD, I did read Dr. Longo’s book “the Longevity Diet”. His book gave me a lot of confidence in FMD vs water only fasting. Besides the genius that is FMD, the prolon kit was very easy to follow. 

That all said, going forward I will DIY my following FMD fasts, incorporating their prolon fasting bars. 

Here are good DIY resources I found online for DIY:

I ran a few tests and here’s what I noticed.

Recipe: Pietro 7"" / 250 ml / 5 min brew time

Pulsar Mini

1. Holds heat better - about 4°C warmer/more stable.
2. EXT is higher by about 1-2 points. With each increase in coffee dose, EXT goes up. I think this is because the brew temperature is slightly higher.
3. Filtration improved thanks to a thicker coffee bed. Now there’s much less bitterness and astringency.
4. I switched from 15 g to 20 g of coffee, and the Pulsar Mini handles it really well.

Pulsar

1. Best suited for larger doses and immersion-style brewing.
2. If you have a poor grinder and/or water, you might not be able to notice the difference.

Overall: I’m very happy with it. I didn’t expect that reducing the diameter would be an improvement!

1q7kz2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1q7kz2w/what_older_men_wish_theyd_learned_at_20_the/,What Older Men Wish They'd Learned at 20: The Science-Based Life Guide Nobody Shares,"Spent months diving into research, interviews with men 40+, books like *The Defining Decade*, podcasts with psychologists, and countless YouTube deep dives. The patterns were insane. Almost every guy I talked to had the same regrets, wished they'd known the same stuff. So here's what actually matters, stripped of the feel good BS.

**your 20s aren't a throwaway decade**

Society sells you this lie that your 20s are for ""finding yourself"" and ""having fun"" while real life starts at 30. Bullshit. Your brain doesn't finish developing until 25, but the habits you build in your 20s? They compound. Hard. The guys who figured this out early are miles ahead now, not because they're smarter, just because they started earlier.

This isn't about grinding 24/7 or skipping parties. It's about being intentional instead of drifting. Most 20 year olds operate on autopilot, doing what feels good in the moment, avoiding discomfort. Then they wake up at 35 wondering where the time went.

**stop outsourcing your confidence to others**

Biggest one. Men in their 40s and 50s all said the same thing: they wasted years seeking validation from women, from friends, from society. Basing their entire self worth on whether someone swiped right or if they got invited to parties.

Here's what actually builds confidence: competence. Get good at something. Anything. Learn to cook properly, lift heavy, speak another language, build stuff with your hands. Real confidence comes from knowing you can figure shit out, not from Instagram likes.

*The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem* by Nathaniel Branden breaks this down perfectly. Branden was a psychologist who spent decades studying self worth, and this book is genuinely life changing. The core idea is that self esteem comes from living consciously and practicing self acceptance, not external validation. Reading this at 20 instead of 30 would save you a decade of people pleasing.

**your body won't always bounce back**

At 20, you can eat garbage, skip sleep, party hard, and feel fine the next day. That window closes faster than you think. By 30, hangovers last three days. By 40, that old shoulder injury from pickup basketball becomes chronic pain.

Start lifting now. Not to get jacked for Instagram, but because muscle mass and bone density in your 20s literally determines your quality of life at 70. Cardio matters too. Your heart doesn't care about your excuses.

The *Huberman Lab* podcast has incredible episodes on fitness and longevity. Andrew Huberman is a Stanford neuroscientist who makes complex biology actually understandable. His episode on optimizing testosterone naturally should be required listening for every guy in his 20s. No bro science, just peer reviewed research explained clearly.

**money compounds, so does debt**

Every older guy I talked to wished they'd understood compound interest earlier. Not in a boring finance class way, but viscerally. If you invest $5,000 at 20, it becomes $70,000 by retirement. Same investment at 30 becomes $27,000. The math is brutal.

But here's the thing, it's not about penny pinching. It's about understanding that small money decisions now have massive long term consequences. That daily $6 coffee is whatever. But financing a new car at 23% interest because you wanted to look successful? That's a trap that takes years to escape.

Read *The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel. It won multiple awards and Housel writes for the Wall Street Journal. This isn't your typical finance book full of formulas and jargon. It's about how people actually behave with money, why we make irrational decisions, and how to build wealth through good habits instead of trying to outsmart the market. Genuinely changed how I think about every purchase.

**most friendships are circumstantial**

Hard pill. Your college buddies, your high school crew, those guys you see every weekend? Most of them won't be in your life at 35. Not because anyone did anything wrong, just because proximity was the main thing holding it together.

The friendships that last are the ones you actively maintain. You have to put in effort. Send the text. Make the plans. Show up when it's inconvenient. Adult friendships require intention because you're not forced together by circumstance anymore.

Older men consistently ranked loneliness as one of their biggest struggles. They got busy with careers and kids and looked up one day realizing they hadn't had a real conversation with a friend in months. Don't let that happen. Male friendship prevents depression, improves health outcomes, and makes life actually enjoyable according to decades of research.

**therapy isn't for broken people**

Stigma around mental health is finally dying, but most guys still wait until they're in crisis mode before seeing a therapist. That's like waiting until you have a heart attack before exercising.

Therapy when you're relatively stable is preventative maintenance. You learn healthy coping mechanisms before you desperately need them. You identify patterns before they become entrenched. You process stuff instead of burying it until it explodes later.

If traditional therapy feels too formal, try *Ash* app. It's like having a relationship and mental health coach in your pocket. The AI guides you through research backed exercises for managing anxiety, improving communication, building emotional intelligence. Not a replacement for real therapy but incredibly useful for everyday challenges.

**skills beat credentials**

College can be valuable, but the degree itself matters way less than everyone says. Older men consistently wished they'd spent more time building actual skills instead of just collecting credentials.

Can you code? Can you sell? Can you write persuasively? Can you fix things? Can you manage projects? These abilities transcend industries and create opportunities that degrees don't.

The guys who thrived in their 30s and 40s weren't necessarily the ones with the fanciest schools on their resumes. They were the ones who could actually do stuff that created value for others. Start building now. Side projects, freelance work, YouTube tutorials, whatever. Just build things and share them.

BeFreed is an AI powered learning platform built by Columbia University alumni that pulls from millions of high quality sources, books, research papers, expert interviews, and real world success stories to generate personalized audio podcasts based on whatever you want to learn.

Type in a skill or goal, like improving communication or building better habits, and it creates a custom podcast with an adaptive learning plan tailored to your intelligence type and learning style. You control the depth, from a quick 10 minute overview to a 40 minute deep dive with detailed examples and context. The voice customization is genuinely addictive, you can pick anything from a deep, smoky tone to something more energetic or sarcastic depending on your mood.

There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with anytime to ask questions, get book recommendations, or dive deeper into specific topics. All content goes through strict fact checking to keep information accurate and science based. It's been super useful for internalizing concepts instead of just passively consuming information.

**your parents were probably right about some stuff**

Yeah, this one stings. But multiple older guys said they wasted years rebelling against parental advice that turned out to be accurate. Not everything obviously, but more than they wanted to admit at 20.

That partner they said was bad news? They saw red flags you were blind to. That career path they suggested? Maybe it wasn't about controlling you, maybe they understood the market better. That advice to save money? Turns out compound interest is real.

You don't have to follow every piece of parental wisdom, but at least consider it seriously instead of dismissing it reflexively. They've lived decades you haven't. Sometimes experience actually does matter more than youthful confidence.

**the relationship you have at 22 probably won't last, and that's okay**

Older men wished someone had told them not to force relationships that weren't working just because they'd invested time. The sunk cost fallacy destroys more relationships than infidelity.

People change massively between 20 and 30. You'll change. She'll change. The person you're compatible with at 22 might not be who you need at 32. That's not failure, that's growth.

Don't rush into marriage because you hit some arbitrary timeline. Don't stay in mediocre relationships because you're comfortable. Don't sacrifice your growth for someone who isn't growing with you. This applies to friendships too.

**you're not as smart as you think, and that's actually good news**

At 20, you think you've got the world figured out. Every older man I interviewed laughed at this. They all thought the same thing at 20, and they were all hilariously wrong about most of it.

The good news? Admitting you don't know everything is liberating. It means you can learn. It means you can change your mind when presented with better information. It means you don't have to defend stupid positions just because you stated them confidently once.

Intellectual humility is a superpower. The guys who stayed curious and adaptable thrived. The ones who dug into their 20 year old worldview and refused to evolve got left behind.

Stay uncomfortable. Keep learning. Your future self will thank you for starting now instead of waiting until life forces you to change. The time passes anyway, might as well build something worth having.",1,1767899655.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False
1q7kyvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1q7kyvl/credit_card_utilisation_to_build_score/,Credit card utilisation to build score,"I recently got a Tesco 0% credit builder card. I’m finding it hard to find stuff to put on the card. I’ve done the occasional hotel booking and a few purchases like a hoover on there but apart from that I’m totally unsure what to put on and if it will affect my credit. If I use the card for small purchases like a coffee/lunch or even to buy vapes will it negatively affect me? 

I have a little side job that pays cash so to get rid of the cash I buy my petrol and food shopping each week which comes to the amount I get. So them purchases are kind of off the table.


Does it really matter what I put on the card? And how much of the £500 limit should I be using to get the best credit score increase month on month?

I am away from the city: in the countryside, visiting my parents. I can see the stars. How glorious! My four-year old daughter V sleeps inside the house. Soon she will be my age, and the sky will stay the same, and I will be dead.*

—from the journal of Norman Crane, dated August 12, 2025

- - -

Norman Crane sat alone outside looking up at the night sky. He was away from the city, in the countryside, visiting his parents. For once, he could see the stars and they were glorious! His four-year old daughter, V, was sleeping in the house.

Frogs croaked in a nearby pond.

A neighbour turned off the last electric light on the street.

All windows were dark.

Only the stars remained, and the memory of a presently unfolding life; then even those were gone, and under the unbroken, vast and timeless universal sea, Norman turns to you and says, “Imagine that you're looking out at space before the formation of the Earth, the Sun, before the formation of any stars or planets, before the laws of nature, when all that was, was a stagnant equilibrium of potential...

[*Where am I?* you may wonder. Don't worry, you're simply reading a story.]

You look up:

Space is impenetrably dark; smooth as a freshly-pressed shirt, but deep: deeper than any material you've ever seen. Existence is a cup of black coffee, extracted from freshly roasted beans, poured into a white porcelain cup. You are gazing *through* the surface.

- - -

>*Can't write. Can't sleep. 2:22 a.m. Staring at phone. Made another coffee. Maybe I'll have eighteen straight, set a record. Haha —> doom-scroll-time. It's funny. I'm  tired. The coffee is a mirror that never reflects my face. I hover over it. Squint. The cup's half full. The coffee reflects its empty upper-half and the space above. It's an illusion: an illusion of depth that tells the truth about reality. I put my finger in the coffee—breaking the surface—validating the illusion. I don't feel the bottom of the cup. That's always been my fear: to drown without dying, descending without end. Amen.*

—from the journal of Norman Crane, dated July 29, 2025

“Dip your finger in it.”

*What?*

“Reach out and put your finger into space,” says Norman Crane.

*No.*

“Why not?”

*I don't know. I don't want to disturb it, I guess,* you say. *I like it the way it is.*

“How do you know there's something to disturb?”

*Where am I?* you ask,

rotating suddenly your head, except the very concept of rotation doesn't make sensorial sense because, “You *are* not anywhere,” Norman says, as everywhere space is the same (featureless, still and immense) and as your head moves your point of view changes but the view itself remains unchanged. You are spinning in place, losing a balance you never knew, when

—a **HUMAN FACE** **violently** ***BREAKS*** through the starless black!

*Norman!*

[A numbed silence.]

The face is **everywhere,** its mouth open, teeth bared, gasp-gargling, sucking space down its throat, coughing then expelling it, galaxy-sized bubbles streaming out its nostrils. The skin is pink. The eyes wide, confused, terrified—

*Norman, are you there?*

[A knock.]

[The creaking of a leather chair.]

*Norman, come on. Are you fucking there? What is this—what the hell's going on?* you say, but I'm not “there” anymore. There's been a knock on the door and I've gotten up from my desk, my laptop, to answer it. It's so late at night. Who could it be?

The face is drowning.

Time's passing.

Space—the universe—existence—**everything** has been intruded on, disarranged **by this impossibly gargantuan human face**, evoking awe (because of its size) and horror (because *what is it?*) and sadness (because it's dying,

and, dying, upsets the order of the world; introducing energy, injecting stability with chaos, struggling, trying to breathe and you feel the emanating waves, are aware of each tiny movement and know its significance. Take, for example, this one: a professor in a lecture hall could point to it with a wooden pointer. The students are taking notes. The experience—what you see—is happening before you *and* on his blackboard, drawn in white chalk.

“And this twitch of the lip,” lectures the professor, slamming the tip of the pointer against the blackboard where the face's mouth is, “is responsible for gravity.” “And see this fluttering eyelid? It is the origin of electromagnetism.” “And here: here in the final expulsions of swallowed liquid space—mixed with whatever scrapings of the throat—you are witness to the first link in the great chain of consciousness.”

A student raises a hand.

“Yes?”

“What about time?” she asks politely.

The face's skin once pink is greying pale. Its eyes are static. The violence is over. No more streaming, rising, bursting bubbles. No more struggle. The face hangs now in space, inert—a drowned, suspended deadness. Its hair a gently floating crown of spaceweeds.

Yet what describes one part of a system seldom describes the system as a whole. Thus there is no calm. Space is being permeated, heated and remade. Physics is forming. Math is becoming its self-understanding. You see, one-by-one, the first stars come out.

“Time,” begins the professor—

Standing in the open door is V, her eyes foggy and hair a mess. “Daddy,” she says sleepily.

“Yes, bunny?”

“I miss you,” she said and gave me a big hug, which became a big climb, and when the climb was over, with her cuddling body held against mine, I walked to the bedroom and sat on the bed.

The story was still vivid in my mind.

V yawned.

She didn't want to let me go, so I held her until I yawned too. She was warm. The bed was comfortable. The night was deep and my eyelids leaden. The caffeine was wearing off. I wouldn't get to eighteen cups. The twinkling stars looked in on us through the window. I didn't get up to shut the curtains. I held the story in my mind. I held it until: V fell asleep, and somehow I fell asleep too.

I awoke to sunshine. “Daddy. Get up. It's day. It's daaaay!”

We brushed our teeth.

We ate.

The story was no longer there. I had written up to “‘Time,’ begins the professor—” and couldn't remember what was supposed to come after. All day I tried to figure it out, by re-reading what I had written, sitting in the leather chair in which I had written it, but it was no use. The idea had disappeared.

I had been writing a story based on a dream and was interrupted by an unexpected visitor, unable to ever finish what I'd started, which is at least one interesting thing I have in common with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, but whereas his man on business from Porlock was an unwelcome guest, my visitor was the most welcome in the world.

I wonder if you'll ever read this, V.

If so: I love you.

(If not, I love you too!)

But it eats away at me, the story. The mystery. The knowledge that there was a solution, that the face drowned in space had come from somewhere, had been meant to mean something. All I know is what you've read and that I’d saved the file as *new-zork-origin-story.txt.*

- - -

>~~*Shaking and still short of breath from having burst out the door and chased the visitor across the village of Nether Stewey and into the hills, all the way to the edge of the lake, “Drink! Drink the fucking milk of Paradise!” Samuel Taylor Coleridge screamed, forcing the man's head to stay submerged, fisting his hair and pushing on the back of his head with all his enraged might. “Drink it all! Drink. It. All!*~~

I drove through Porlock, Ontario, once, on my way to Thunder Bay. There was absolutely nothing there—no town, no buildings, no people—save for a solitary man walking dazed along the unpaved shoulder of the highway. He looked an awful lot like me.

My issue is, I have a weird eating schedule. It's basically more or less accidental intermittent fasting between the hours of let's say 1 PM to 9 AM. At 9 AM I have breakfast and sometimes coffee w/ protein powder mixed in, then around 1 PM I have a pretty big lunch, then I might have some coffee later and occasionally a small snack in the afternoon but otherwise I don't feel like eating anything the rest of the day so I usually don't eat anything for dinner.

If I want to commit to 2 or 3 classes a week at the gym I like the most in my area (tried several and this one is the one that I felt most comfortable in), I would have to attend the 6 AM class. I don't feel even the slightest bit hungry that early in the morning.

Is there any harm in doing crossfit without having eating anything for 18ish hours prior? In this scenario I would have a protein-heavy breakfast within 2 hours of finishing class (along the lines of a breakfast burrito with eggs, potato, cheese, and meatless ground ""beef"", or greek yoghurt with protein powder mixed in).

Am I going to pass out from hunger in class or do any long-term damage to my body if I go this route, or should I try to adjust my eating to include a meal in the evenings before a morning class?",2,1767899507.0,crossfit,9,1.0,False
1q7kwgc,https://i.redd.it/niefye3qc6cg1.png,Your space is missing something (and it's not another throw pillow),"You've spent hours perfecting your place. The furniture, the lighting, the art on the walls. But there's one design element that often gets overlooked: scent. 

Good design includes how it smells.

Think about that stunning hotel lobby from your last trip, your favorite coffee shop, or that friend's apartment where you always feel relaxed. You probably remember how it smelled. That's because scent creates atmosphere in a way nothing else can. It's the finishing touch that makes your space feel distinctly yours.

Your space already has its own distinct style. Now it needs a signature scent to match.

Just like you wouldn't randomly choose furniture, your home fragrance should be intentional. For so many of our customers, [Red Currant](https://votivo.com/collections/red-currant?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=Your+space+is+missing+something) (tart citrus and earthy greens) has become that signature scent.

I opened it and it was clear it was a diary of sort as soon as I read the first sentence, but only a couple pages were filled out. 

I know I should have closed it immediately but I didn’t. I have my reasons all of which are not an excuse. Biggest reason is I’m worried about her mental health because a few months ago I saw that she had cut her arm and she admitted it was on purpose when I asked her about it. She was upset about her ex.

The notebook was specifically was about a man she’s been seeing. The man is someone she met about 5 years ago when in high school. He’s 50 years older at least and it appears they have some kind of relationship going on. 

I’m very worried. She does talk to me about meeting up for coffee or dinner with this man but hasn’t admitted anything else. She gave me this info without me asking. 

Should I ask her about him and see if she admits it or should I just give her the general “I’m here if you want to talk and not judge you” thing that that I’ve always said. Or should I mind my own business? Am I being a helicopter mom?

I just love her so much and I don’t want her to get hurt. I’m very worried. I know she’s an adult and I know I was wrong for reading it. There really is no excuse. But she’s been through a lot in the past year.

I haven’t told anyone else in my life what’s going on including my partner (not her dad). I know what he would say and I fear he’d go after the guy. ",1,1767899263.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

here's what i found: you don't need 50 pieces. you need 15 good ones that actually work together. this isn't about looking like a model or copying some influencer's aesthetic. it's about understanding what makes someone look put together vs sloppy, and the psychology behind why certain clothes make you feel more confident.

spoiler: it's not about brands or spending thousands. it's about fit and versatility.

 the actual essentials (no bs)
 white crew neck tee (2 3 of these)  
not hanes from walmart. get something with a proper fit that hits mid zipper and doesn't look like a potato sack. the fabric should be thick enough that your nipples aren't saying hello. this is your foundation piece.

i cannot stress this enough: fit is literally everything. a $20 tee that fits well beats a $200 designer one that doesn't. the book ""Dress for Success"" by John T. Molloy breaks down actual studies showing that well fitted clothing increases perceived competence by up to 40%. insanely good read if you want to understand the actual science behind this stuff.

 dark wash jeans (slim or straight fit)  
black or dark indigo. no rips, no distressing, no weird fades. these should fit properly at the waist (no sagging) and have a slight taper. you'll wear these 80% of the time.

 chinos (navy and khaki)  
more versatile than you think. can dress up or down instantly. the difference between looking like you're trying vs looking effortlessly good often comes down to having the right bottom for the occasion.

 white button down shirt  
oxford cloth or poplin. roll the sleeves for casual, keep them down for formal. this single piece can take you from coffee date to job interview. make sure it fits in the shoulders, that's the hardest part to tailor later.

 henley (navy or grey)  
basically a tee with buttons. adds visual interest without trying too hard. great for fall layering.

  crew neck sweater (grey or navy)  
wool or cotton blend. wear it over the button down, over the tee, or alone. this is your ""i know what i'm doing"" piece.

the Style Guy podcast has an entire episode on capsule wardrobes and they mention how having 3 4 good layering pieces eliminates like 90% of ""i have nothing to wear"" moments. it's all about combinations.

bomber or denim jacket  
jackets are instant style boosters. they add structure and make any basic outfit look intentional. bomber works for almost everything, denim is more casual but equally versatile.

minimalist white sneakers  
stan smiths, common projects, even clean all white vans. these go with literally everything. the psychology research is actually wild here, clean white sneakers consistently rate higher for approachability and youth in social perception studies.

 eather or suede chelsea boots  
your ""grown up"" shoe. works with jeans, works with chinos, makes you look like you have your life together even when you don't.

 dark leather belt  
matches your shoes. simple. no giant buckles, no weird designs.
watch (simple, classic style)  
doesn't need to be expensive. just needs to look intentional. timex weekender, seiko 5, casio if you want that retro vibe. the point is having something on your wrist that isn't an apple watch 24/7.

  plain baseball cap (black or navy)  
for bad hair days or casual weekend vibes. keep it simple, no logos or weird graphics.

  dark joggers or sweatpants (fitted, not baggy)  
athleisure is here to stay. get ones that actually have structure and don't look like you just rolled out of bed. pair with the white tee and white sneakers for an easy weekend fit. quality underwear and socks  nobody sees them but YOU know. and that matters more than you think. there's actual research in ""Enclothed Cognition"" studies showing that what you wear closest to your skin affects your psychological state. wild but true.structured backpack or leather messenger bag  
completes the look. shows you're organized. herschel, fjallraven, or even a simple leather satchel.

 why this actually works

the reason this list works isn't because i'm some fashion genius. it's because every piece serves multiple purposes and works with everything else. you can literally create 50+ outfits from these 15 items.the book ""The Psychology of Fashion"" by Carolyn Mair dives deep into why clothing choices affect both how others perceive us AND how we perceive ourselves. turns out dressing better isn't shallow, it's literally affecting your confidence at a neurological level.

BeFreed is an AI learning app built by a team from Columbia University that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio podcasts and adaptive learning plans. 

For style specifically, it pulls from sources like ""Dress for Success"" and ""The Psychology of Fashion,"" plus expert interviews and research on social perception. You can customize the depth, anywhere from a 10 minute overview to a 40 minute deep dive with real examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive, you can pick anything from a smoky, sarcastic narrator to something more straightforward and factual. 

It also builds a structured learning plan based on what kind of person you want to become, whether that's more confident in social settings or just someone who actually has their aesthetic together. Perfect for commutes or gym time when you want to absorb this stuff without sitting down to read.

also important: none of this matters if the fit is wrong. go to a tailor. spend $15 30 getting things adjusted. the difference is astronomical.

one more thing, if you want to actually see how pieces work together, the youtube channel Teachingmensfashion and Real Men Real Style both have solid content on building versatile wardrobes without the hype beast nonsense.look, changing how you dress won't fix your life. but it will make you feel more confident, more put together, and weirdly more like yourself. and that's not nothing.",1,1767899074.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False

[Budget $650 or less],"I am in the market for an Espresso machine and know I want a broad range of features and flexibility. No doubt these machines, all made by Gemila have remarkable features for the price. I already understand about getting a Gaggia Classic Evo Pro and for durability it's a win but it just won't flex in an easy way. I see the mods, adding computer interfaces--that's not my bag. It's a bunch of work, additional investment and gadgetry added to the machine. Gemilai, having been to Asia--reliable brand, it's very common, had been around. 

In the USA my concern with MiiCoffee, Turin, Gemilai and the identical to Turin machines on AliExpress ( no logos, same features) is that there aren't service venues. Turin fortunately is taking calls from people, responsive but it's funny they are selling the unbranded units that are the same as the unbranded units on Ali--granted, Turin is saying they are testing units, have some way to guarantee the unit is operating etc. Aliexpress prices for USA with shipping can be $349-$380 for machines that are identical to the Turin---granted one has to navigate Aliexpress if something goes wrong , damaged items, delays............

1q7kn27,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1q7kn27/a_novel_im_starting/,A novel I’m starting,"Chapter 1: a
mental hospitals, one bag, and now this. I was officially relocated. The woman ushered me inside. The house smelled like lemon cleaner and something overcooked. Family photos lined the walls, carefully arranged, like proof. Proof of stability. Proof of normalcy. Proof that I was now the anomaly. “This will be your room,” she said, opening a door.
The room was small but clean. A bed with a floral comforter. A desk. A window that faced the backyard fence. Nothing sharp. Nothing personal. Nothing mine.
I stood there while she talked about schedules and expectations and how we’d all “get along just fine.” Her voice blurred into background noise, like elevator music for my life, but less interesting. New house. New rules. Same me.
I set my bag down on the bed and looked around, already cataloging escape routes, hiding places, worst-case scenarios. It wasn’t pessimism. It was preparation. Some people unpack clothes when they arrive somewhere new. I make contingency plans. They sometimes fail, but they always are an arkive. I hope sometimes someone who needs someone to relate to can use me for that.

Chapter 2: D
I dropped off my last case just before dusk. The transfer was clean. Signatures in the right places. No complications that would follow me home. It should’ve been a good ending to a long day. I sat in the car for a moment after pulling away, hands resting on the steering wheel, letting the engine idle. The house faded into the rearview mirror. Another placement. Another life changed for better or for worse. I told myself the girl would adjust. The home met every requirement. Stable income. No prior incidents. That was as close to reassurance as the job ever offered. Outcomes were never promises. They were margins.
I drove home without the radio. I rarely turned it on anymore. Sound demanded energy I didn’t have. The route was familiar enough that I barely registered the turns.
Home meant my father. He had been diagnosed with ALS eight months ago. Motor neuron disease. Progressive. Terminal. The kind of diagnosis doctors deliver carefully in a sweet quiet voice like language itself would change the life shattering news they were giving. At the time, they spoke in timelines and percentages. I used to wish they would stop talking about him like he was an object, now though I am thankful they do. In some ways it makes it all easier, I can pretend for a while I’m losing a thing not a person. I can pretend that he isn’t all I have left. I can act like I’m not losing my entire life slowly from the weight of the bills.
I unlocked the front door and stepped inside. The house was quiet except for the low hum of the oxygen concentrator in the living room. That sound had become the new baseline. Proof of life measured in machinery. “Dad,” I called softly.
“In here,” he answered, his voice thin, strained.
He was in his chair by the window, shoulders slumped forward, hands resting uselessly in his lap. The television was on but muted. He watched it anyway, eyes unfocused. When I stepped closer, I saw the tremor in his fingers. Subtle, but constant.
“You’re late,” he said.
“I know,” I replied. “Long day.”
He tried to smile. It didn’t quite make it to his eyes.
“Was it the kids again?”
“Yes.”
He nodded once. Talking tired him now. Everything did. I knelt beside him to adjust the blanket that had slipped from his knees.
“You eat?” I asked.
“Not really.” A pause. “Didn’t feel like it.”
I reached for the glass of water on the table and held it while he took a slow, careful sip. His hands shook too much to manage it alone. When he finished, he exhaled sharply, like he’d run a mile.
“I hate this,” he said quietly, staring at the floor.
“I know,” I said. I wish I could tell him that I hated this too, it was so slow. I just want the inevitable to happen already.
But I would never say that. There wasn’t anything else to say. Comfort felt dishonest, and encouragement felt shallow.
I stood and went to the kitchen, reheated the soup I’d left that morning. When I brought it back, he looked at it like an obligation.
“I’ll try,” he said.
“That’s enough,” I told him. I would end up feeding him, but I know that him trying made him feel better.
He managed a few spoonfuls before his arm began to tremble harder. I took the spoon from him without asking and fed him the rest. Neither of us commented on it. That was the rule now. No commentary. No acknowledgment. Just adaptation.
Later, after I helped him into bed and adjusted the pillows so his breathing came easier, he looked at me and said, “You don’t have to do this alone.”
I met his gaze. “I know.”
It wasn’t a lie. It just wasn’t useful.
I turned off the light and stood in the hallway for a moment longer than necessary. My reflection in the darkened mirror looked older than it should have. Tired in a way sleep doesn’t fix and never will.
Tomorrow there would be more cases. More assessments. More children who needed someone functional, not fragile. The system did not pause for grief, and neither could I.
I went to bed knowing the night would be short.
They always were now.

Chapter 3: A
I woke up to the sharp ringing of a bell, like I did every morning now.
Not an alarm. A bell. Loud. Metallic. Personal. The kind that doesn’t just wake you up, it announces that sleep was a privilege you’ve officially lost. Miss Weston believed in it. Said it was “traditional.” Which is code for I read this in a parenting book written by someone who hates children.
Miss Weston, my new foster mom, was the picture of warmth and kindness if you only looked at her face and didn’t listen to anything she said. She loved her schedule more than her husband, and significantly more than either of the girls currently living in her house. Order was her religion. The actual religion was just a bonus add-on.
Up at six.
Breakfast at six thirty.
School from seven to three.
After that, religious school until six. For what faith? Unclear. Christian-adjacent. Vibes-based theology. A lot of smiling while explaining why free will was overrated. And human rights didn’t really matter.
Then extracurriculars until seven thirty. I did programming. Not because she understood what that meant, but because it sounded productive and didn’t involve touching other people. Dinner. One hour of homework. Bed.
Every day ran on the same stupid routine. And any changes from that were treated like moral failures.
I shared the house with one other girl, quieter than furniture. She followed rules like they were gravity. Didn’t question anything. Didn’t complain. I think she’d learned that compliance was currency. I hadn’t, which made me the problem child by default.
That morning at breakfast, Miss Weston stood at the counter with her planner open, highlighter in hand, while we ate oatmeal that tasted like it had been punished for existing.
“You were up late last night,” she said without looking at me.
“No,” I said. “I was in bed.”
“You were awake,” she corrected.
I stared at her. You had to be kidding me, I was in bed doing literally nothing. “Is that… illegal now?” I said in a snarky voice.
She finally looked up. Smiled. The kind of smile that warns you.
“Rest is important for growing minds,” she said.
I made a mental note to convince the school to tell her I didn’t have a growing mind.
School was school. Lockers. Bells. Teachers who saw foster kids as either fragile glass or future criminals, no in-between. I kept my head down, finished my work early, and waited for the next transition like a prisoner counting meal times.
By the time we got home, my brain felt like static.
Programming was in the basement. Miss Weston had proudly announced it as the “technology room.” One desk. One ancient desktop computer. Beige tower. Dusty fan. Running some version of Windows that had personally offended time itself.
“Internet is filtered,” she told me, standing in the doorway. “For your safety.”
“Of course it is,” I said.
She left. Door clicked shut.
I woke the computer. It whined like it resented being alive. I logged in. Generic account. No admin privileges. Cute.
The filter was laughable. Some off-the-shelf parental control software installed badly and updated never. Whoever set it up assumed kids were stupid. That was their first mistake.
I didn’t do anything dramatic. No hacking into the Pentagon. No stolen identities although I could. Just curiosity. I mapped the network. Local only. Router upstairs. Default settings. Default credentials. Because of course.
Miss Weston trusted God and factory passwords.
I bypassed the filter in under ten minutes. Didn’t even feel good about it. Felt like picking a lock made of wet cardboard. I pulled up logs, just to see. Everything was monitored. Time online. Sites visited. Keystrokes flagged for “concerning language.”
I typed “freedom” into a text file.
Flagged immediately.
Interesting.
I didn’t change anything permanent. Didn’t want to get caught yet. Just enough to remind myself I still could do things. That I wasn’t just a body being moved from activity to activity like a pawn with anxiety.
Dinner was chicken and rice. We ate in silence while Miss Weston talked about church plans. Sunday would be “a full day.” Apparently God liked efficiency.
That night, lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and listened to the house settle. Pipes ticking. Floorboards creaking. Somewhere upstairs, a printer ran. Schedules printing themselves into existence.
One week in, and I already knew how this place worked.
Control dressed up as care.
Routine mistaken for love.
Obedience marketed as safety.
They hadn’t accounted for boredom.
And boredom, given enough time and a badly secured network, tends to get creative.
I should feel bad.

Chapter 4: D
I had to meet with my cases today.
Two of them. Azly and Zaria.
They were on opposite sides of town, which meant no margin for error. Azly I’d pull out of school. Zaria I’d see after dinner. I’d already been awake since five, and my head felt like it had cotton stuffed behind my eyes. Coffee stopped working months ago. Now it was just a ritual.
I parked outside the school and sat in the car longer than necessary. My hands were steady. That didn’t mean I wasn’t tired. It meant I was used to it.
Inside, the front desk was staffed by a woman who looked aggressively pleasant. Bright smile. Soft voice. The kind of person who still believed schools were safe places.
“I’m here to see Azly,” I said, flashing my credentials before she could start asking questions.
She paused, read the papers, frowned slightly, then nodded. “I’ll call her down.”
I didn’t thank her. Politeness takes energy.
The office they put me in was small and over-lit. A metal chair bolted to the floor. A desk with nothing on it. Schools love rooms like this. Neutral spaces for unpleasant conversations.
Azly came in a few minutes later. She didn’t look surprised. That bothered me more than if she had.
She sat without being told. Leaned back. Watched me like she was already bored.
“How’s the placement?” I asked.
“Bad.”
Straightforward. At least she wasn’t wasting my time.
“Jane Weston says you’re disrupting the household.”
Azly smiled, thin and humorless. “She also thinks schedules are a personality.”
I wrote something down, mostly to look like I was doing my job.
“She says you’re resistant,” I continued.
“She says that about gravity too,” Azly said. “Doesn’t mean it stops existing.”
Smart mouth. Sharp mind. I’d seen it before. Kids like her didn’t melt. They cracked systems instead, and systems hated that.
“What exactly is the issue?” I asked.
“She controls everything,” Azly said. “Sleep. Food. Time. Thought. She monitors the computer. She times bathroom breaks. She treats silence like obedience and questions like crimes.”
I didn’t react. Reacting invites expectation.
“She’s structured,” I said.
“She’s afraid,” Azly shot back. “And she calls it faith.”
I closed the folder. I already knew how this would go.
“I don’t have another placement,” I said. “Not one that doesn’t come with worse problems.”
Azly looked at me then. Really looked.
“So I just wait,” she said. Not a question.
“Yes.”
She nodded once. No dramatics. No tears. That was worse.
I walked her back to class and left without watching her sit down. If I watched, I’d start thinking. Thinking led to mistakes.
Zaria was after dinner.
Her foster home was louder. Messier. Less controlled, but no safer. Different flavor of damage. She met me on the porch, arms crossed, already angry.
“They’re trying to send me back,” she said before I even spoke.
“For what?” I asked.
“For not pretending,” she snapped. “For not being grateful enough.”
I checked the notes. Missed curfew. Talking back. Skipped church.
“Do you want to go back?” I asked.
“No,” Zaria said immediately. Then quieter, “I just want it to stop changing.”
I didn’t promise anything. Promises rot fast in this job.
By the time I drove home, the sky was dark and my chest felt tight in that familiar way. Bills waited on the counter. The phone buzzed twice. I ignored it.
My father was in his chair when I walked in. Oxygen humming. Hands trembling. He looked smaller every day, like something was erasing him slowly and carefully.
“You’re late,” he said.
“I know.”
He tried to shift and failed. I helped him without asking.
“You eat?” I asked.
“Didn’t feel like it.”
I poured water. Held the cup while he drank. Watched his hands shake hard enough to spill.
“I hate being like this,” he said.
“I know.”
That was all I had left.
I got him into bed, adjusted the pillows, checked the machine. He looked at me like he wanted to say something important, then didn’t. I turned off the light before either of us could regret it.
I stood alone in the hallway afterward, head against the wall, eyes closed.
There were easier ways to make money. Ways that wouldn’t involve telling kids to endure things I wouldn’t survive myself. I knew where those paths led. I’d seen them up close.
I was still too ethical for them.
Barely.
Tomorrow I’d do it all again.

Chapter 5: a
After the lesson, I went straight to the computer.
No pause. No processing. No deep reflection about faith or morality or becoming a better person. I was tired in a way that lives behind your eyes. The kind that turns patience into something theoretical. The kind that makes decisions feel obvious.
The basement was quiet. Blessedly so. Just the low hum of the computer tower and the faint ticking of the house above me, like it was breathing.
I sat down and logged in.
First thing I checked was the network panel. No surprises there. Default credentials. Admin. Admin. Because Miss Weston trusted God, schedules, and whatever came out of the box without reading the instructions.
I stared at the screen for a moment longer than necessary.
Then I kicked everyone off.
Phones. Tablets. The laptop upstairs that Miss Weston used for her schedules and sermons and emails that started with Concerned about Azly’s behavior. Gone. Everything disconnected in one clean sweep.
The house went quiet in a different way after that. The kind of quiet that happens right before someone notices.
I blocked every website on Miss Weston’s approved list. Religious resources. Parenting forums. Church calendars. All of it. If it brought her comfort or validation, it was suddenly unavailable. For balance, I also blocked the school grades portal. Not out of malice. Just symmetry.
I didn’t break anything permanently. I wasn’t stupid. I just rearranged reality a little. Nudged it. Made it inconvenient.
Upstairs, I heard footsteps. A door opening. A sharp intake of breath.
“Girls?” Miss Weston called.
I leaned back in the chair and waited.
Her voice got tighter with each attempt to refresh a page. Technology always betrayed her in the same way reality did. It didn’t obey just because she expected it to.
I restored my own access last. Small mercies.
I didn’t feel triumphant. That’s the funny part. No adrenaline rush. No victory music. Just relief. Like stretching a muscle that had been locked too long.
I knew this would come back to me. It always did. I was already marked. Curious. Disruptive. Too smart for my own good. This would just confirm it.
But for about five minutes, the house wasn’t running on her rules.
For five minutes, silence wasn’t obedience.
Schedules weren’t law.
And control didn’t feel so absolute.
That was enough.
I logged out, shut the computer down properly, and went upstairs like nothing had happened.
Miss Weston was standing in the kitchen, staring at her phone like it had personally betrayed her.
“We’re having technical issues,” she said, smiling tightly.
“Sounds frustrating,” I said.
She looked at me for a long moment. Long enough to tell she suspected something. Not enough to prove it.
Control hates uncertainty.
So do people who confuse obedience with love.
I went to bed early that night.
Not because I was compliant.
Because I was exhausted.
And because I knew this was just the beginning.

Chapter 6: D
I walked into the house and immediately knew something was wrong.
It was calm. Too calm. No oxygen hum. No television murmuring to itself. No small, constant sounds that meant my father was still managing to exist. Silence like that doesn’t happen accidentally.
Then I heard it.
A scream. Thin. Broken. Wrong.
“Daina!”
I dropped my bag and ran.
He was on the floor beside his chair, half tangled in the oxygen tubing, one arm twisted under him at an angle that made my stomach drop. His chest heaved like he couldn’t get enough air no matter how hard he tried. His hands clawed uselessly at the carpet.
“I’m here,” I said, already on my knees, already moving. “I’ve got you.”
His legs wouldn’t respond. ALS had taken most of his strength, but today it had taken more. Something had shifted. Slipped. Progressed. It always did when you least wanted it to.
“I can’t—” he gasped. “I can’t breathe.”
I got the mask back on him, checked the machine with hands that were steadier than I felt. The numbers blinked back at me, indifferent. I adjusted the flow, lifted him enough to get him back into the chair, every muscle in my back screaming as much as he was.
It took too long. Everything takes too long when you’re doing it alone.
By the time his breathing slowed, my shirt was damp with sweat and my knees ached from the floor. He leaned back, eyes glassy, exhausted beyond words.
“This is getting worse,” he said quietly.
I didn’t answer. There was nothing useful to say.
The hospital trip was a blur. Fluorescent lights. Beeping machines. A doctor whose face stayed professionally neutral even as his words got worse.
Respiratory decline. Rapid progression. Loss of independent movement. Increased care needs. Eventually, full-time assistance.
Then came the number.
The doctor said it gently, like that mattered.
Home care alone would cost more than my yearly salary. Medications, equipment upgrades, specialized nursing. Not optional. Not temporary. And that was before hospice, before the next stage, before the end everyone refused to say out loud.
Insurance covered some of it.
Some.
I sat there nodding, asking the right questions, taking notes I already knew wouldn’t save me. The math started running in my head automatically. Overtime wouldn’t touch it. Raises didn’t exist. Ethical choices suddenly felt like luxuries.
When I got him home again, it was past midnight. I settled him into bed, adjusted the pillows, checked the tubing again. He looked smaller than he had that morning.
“I’m sorry,” he said.
“For what?”
“For costing you so much.”
That did it. That cracked something sharp and ugly in my chest.
“You didn’t choose this,” I said, harsher than I meant to. “Don’t apologize for being sick.”
He closed his eyes. I didn’t know if he was sleeping or pretending.
I stood in the hallway afterward, staring at the wall, phone buzzing in my pocket with reminders I didn’t want to read. Bills. Deadlines. Numbers that didn’t care how ethical I was.
There were easier ways to get money.
I knew exactly who to call. Exactly what corners could be cut. Exactly which placements paid better and why.
I hadn’t crossed that line yet.
But for the first time, I couldn’t honestly say I never would.
Tomorrow I would go to work.
Tomorrow I would look at Azly and Zaria and tell myself I was protecting them.
Tomorrow I would keep pretending there was time.
Tonight, I just stood there listening to the oxygen machine and wondering which part of my life I was going to let die first.

Chapter 7: a
I ran.
Not away forever. Just to school. Which somehow made it more pathetic. I woke up early and left before breakfast, before Miss Weston could sit across from me with that look. The one that says I know something and I’m deciding how much trouble you’re in.
Everything had blown up because of the router.
Not metaphorically. Not spiritually. Literally.
The house network hadn’t just “gone down.” It had behaved wrong. Devices dropped and rejoined out of order. Some things worked. Some things didn’t. Her laptop could load half a page and then hang like it was thinking about its life choices. Phones reconnected but couldn’t reach anything useful. The grade portal timed out. Her approved sites returned polite little errors that sounded apologetic but firm.
That’s the part that tipped her off.
Systems don’t usually fail creatively unless someone touched them.
She hadn’t yelled right away. That would’ve been easier. Instead, she went quiet. Asked questions that weren’t really questions. Watched me too closely. Mentioned “tampering” like it was a word she’d practiced.
Then came the threat.
“I’ll call Daina.”
Like she was calling tech support. Like this was reversible.
Daina doesn’t fix things. She relocates them.
I ran faster, lungs burning, brain already pulling logs that only existed in my head. I hadn’t done anything elegant. I hadn’t even done anything hard. I’d just leaned on the weak points everyone pretends aren’t there. Defaults. Assumptions. Trust that shouldn’t exist.
And now the house was screaming in its own quiet way.
By the time I hit school, my hands were shaking. The bell rang and sealed me inside, and suddenly I was trapped in a building full of systems that also trusted too much and logged too little.
First period, I couldn’t focus. Not because I was scared. Because my brain was already elsewhere, mapping patterns automatically, like it always does when I’m stressed. I watched the classroom computers boot and noticed which ones stalled. Which ones authenticated faster. Which ones hesitated like they were pulling data from somewhere farther away than they should’ve been.
I hated that I noticed.
I hated that I couldn’t stop.
Between classes, the hallways buzzed with that low institutional anxiety that only adults feel when something technical is wrong and no one knows who to blame yet. Someone mentioned the printers. Someone else said attendance hadn’t synced right. The IT cart rolled past me like a hearse.
That’s when the switch flipped.
Not rage. Not excitement.
Resignation.
If I was already the problem, I might as well understand the scope of it.
So I touched more things.
Not recklessly. Not randomly. Carefully. Tired, but precise. I didn’t smash anything. I nudged. I introduced delays. I created inconsistencies that would take hours to untangle and wouldn’t point cleanly at any one person.
The kind of problems that make administrators argue with each other.
Data that exists but doesn’t agree with itself.
Processes that complete but don’t finalize.
Systems that say “success” and then quietly fail.
Nothing flashy. Nothing that would make a headline. Just enough friction to make the day worse for everyone involved.
Putain.
By lunch, the school felt off. Teachers were snapping. The office phones kept ringing. Someone was walking around with a clipboard like that was going to help.
I sat alone, staring at my tray, not eating. My stomach hurt, but not from hunger. From knowing exactly what I’d done and exactly how bad it could get once someone started correlating timestamps.
This wasn’t clever anymore.
This was escalation.
I’d crossed from reacting to acting. From defending myself to daring the system to notice me properly. And systems always do, eventually.
By the last period, my exhaustion had settled into something dangerous. My thoughts slowed. My judgment dulled. That’s when mistakes happen. Not when you’re emotional. When you’re empty.
The final bell rang and I felt nothing.
No relief. No triumph.
Just the sick certainty that when Miss Weston called Daina, this wouldn’t sound like a misunderstanding. It would sound like a pattern. And patterns get moved.
I walked home slower than usual, replaying everything. The router. The school. The tiny decisions stacking up like bad commits you can’t revert.
I hadn’t broken the world.
I’d just proven I could.
And that, apparently, was worse.
Putain de merde.

1q7kmua,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q7kmua,"In-Hand Review: Stussy Dice Knit is a 10/10, but mixed feelings on the CH Jeans 🎲 (ft. Supreme, Nike, Amiri)","1. Chrome Hearts Multi-Color Cross Trucker Hat**

**Rating:** 7/10
**Review:** It’s a loud piece. The colors on the crosses are vibrant, and the mesh quality is standard—breathable and decent for hot weather. However, the print on the foam front feels a little plasticky, like it might crack or peel after a summer of wear. The silver button on top is a nice detail, but overall it feels a bit lightweight compared to other CH caps I’ve handled.
**Fit:** Standard snapback fit. Sits a bit high on the head.

### **2. New Era NY Yankees Fitted (Side Patch)**

**Rating:** 9/10
**Review:** Can’t go wrong with a classic. The embroidery on the NY logo and the side patch is super clean—no loose threads or connected stitching. The brim came with a standard flat shape but curved easily. The wool blend feels structured and durable. Not much to complain about here, it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
**Fit:** True to size. Fits my head shape perfectly without pinching.

### **3. Nike Tech Fleece Jacket (Grey/Black)**

**Rating:** 8/10
**Review:** The color blocking on this is sick, gives it a more aggressive look than the solid grey ones. Material is smooth and comfortable, standard Tech Fleece quality. My only gripe is the main zipper; it feels a little stiff and catches slightly near the bottom. Hopefully, it loosens up with wear.
**Fit:** Fits slim. At 180cm, the Medium is a perfect fitted look, but if you want to layer a hoodie underneath, you might struggle. Length is spot on.

### **4. Chrome Hearts Black Tonal Cross Jeans**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** These are way more wearable than the blue ones (see #6). The black-on-black patches are subtle and the leather crosses feel decent quality. The denim itself is heavy and rigid, which I like. The buttonhole was incredibly tight, had to fight it to get them open the first time. The wash looks authentic.
**Fit:** Waist is TTS. The length stacks nicely on my Jordans without dragging on the floor.

### **5. Supreme Box Logo Hoodie (Black)**

**Rating:** 7.5/10
**Review:** The blank on this is heavy and stiff—definitely a winter hoodie. The box logo embroidery is centered and straight, no floating 'e'. However, the neck hole is surprisingly tight/small. It’s a struggle to get my head through without messing up my hair. It’s a classic piece, but the comfort isn’t 10/10 due to the stiffness.
**Fit:** Boxy fit. Sleeves are a tiny bit short for my arms (180cm), but the chest is roomy.

### **6. Chrome Hearts Blue Patch Jeans**

**Rating:** 5/10
**Review:** Honestly, not feeling these as much in hand. The craftsmanship is fine, but the design is just too loud in person. The ""CHROME HEARTS"" text across the back is huge and the blue leather patches contrast too much for daily wear. The denim feels slightly thinner than the black pair (#4) as well. Hard to style without looking like a walking billboard.
**Fit:** Fits same as the black pair, straight leg cut.

### **7. Stussy Dice Knit Sweater**

**Rating:** 9.5/10
**Review:** Favorite item of the haul. The knit is surprisingly soft and not itchy at all against bare skin. The dice graphic is woven in clearly, not just printed on top. It has a nice weight to it and drapes really well. Feels like a quality garment that will last a long time.
**Fit:** Slightly oversized/relaxed. The perfect baggy fit for my build.

### **8. Amiri ""Imagination"" Hoodie**

**Rating:** 6/10
**Review:** A bit disappointed with this one. For an ""Amiri"" piece, the blank feels kinda thin and flimsy compared to the Supreme or Carhartt hoodies. The print is okay, but it feels like it might fade after a few washes. It looks cool, but the quality doesn't match the aesthetic. It feels more like a fast-fashion hoodie than a luxury rep.
**Fit:** Fits slightly cropped and wide.

### **9. Carhartt WIP Embroidered Hoodie (Cream)**

**Rating:** 10/10
**Review:** Best bang for your buck. The cream color is beautiful in person (though I’m terrified of spilling coffee on it). The ""Carhartt"" embroidery is thick and premium. The fleece lining is super soft. It’s simple, clean, and feels indestructible.
**Fit:** TTS. Not too boxy, not too slim. Sleeves hit perfectly at the wrist.

### **10. Stussy Arch Logo Hoodie (Black/Yellow)**

**Rating:** 8.5/10
**Review:** Another solid Stussy piece. The yellow text pops really nicely against the black. The logo is a chenille-style texture which adds some nice depth. It’s a good daily driver hoodie. Cuffs are nice and tight, holding the sleeves up well.
**Fit:** Fits similar to the Carhartt one, maybe a little looser in the chest area. Ideal for a relaxed street fit.

Our team pushes code constantly - multiple deploys per hour some days. The problem? Nobody can keep up with what's changing. You check the repo in the morning, grab coffee, come back and suddenly there are 47 new commits.

Good luck understanding what actually matters or how it affects your work. We built Doculearn to solve this with automated flashcards. Here's how it works: 

Every time code is pushed, you get bite-sized flashcards: - What changed - Why it matters - Who needs to know Instead of reading through commit messages and diffs, you swipe through quick cards during your coffee break. 

Takes 2 minutes to stay completely in sync with your team. The result: - No more ""wait, when did we change that?"" - No more meetings just to sync on what shipped - Everyone actually knows what's happening in the codebase It's like having a smart digest of everything your team does, but actually consumable instead of overwhelming. 

We're offering free trials if anyone wants to try it. Honestly just built this because we were drowning in commits and Slack messages. Curious - how does everyone else handle staying updated when your team moves fast?

That was new. Callista peeked at the monitor and saw a spike in the oxygen sensor. She froze. Had it finally happened? A cough tore itself from her throat. Nitrogen. What were the nitrogen levels? If her theories were correct, oxygen at 420 percent meant that nitrogen should have soared to around 30,000 percent. Her finger extended, dusky pink French-tip nail illuminated by the dark light emanating from the screen, and she pressed a button labeled BASIC LIFE SENSORS.

She read through the little markers at the bottom of the screen: Oxygen, Argon, Hydrogen, Helium, Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen. Her eyes lifted, and she frowned. The nitrogen levels were frustratingly low, only 10,000 percent. She noted the anomaly in her pulsar notebook, dwarf star ink languid on the page. Her lips pursed as she wrote.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

Eyes widened as the impossible happened. Each new beep from the monitor indicated that nitrogen was increasing exponentially.

15,000.

20,000.

25,000.

30,000.

30,100.

30,200.

It was slowing down, leveling off. Excellent. That meant only one thing. Her pen scratched on the paper of her notebook.

""722 hours - The seeds planted three years ago have sprouted. Life has found a way.""

This was the culmination of years of work and research. Every hour spent in the stacks, devouring books on horticulture and astrobiology, had finally paid off. She couldn't wait to rub it in Dr. Stuben's face. He had ridiculed her when she had suggested the two sciences would be the breakthrough to creation.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

The tone pulsed steadily from the monitor. Callista heard it, noted it, and returned to staring at the little ball of light. It was housed in a little glass dome, nodes at four intervals around it, wires running back to the monitor. She flexed her hands as she reached for the dome, then pulled them back.

""Slow, Callista, slow. Wait.""

She pulled back, hands smoothing her wrinkled lab coat. There was still one more indicator she needed. It was the piece that proved her most audacious hypothesis, the one her professors consistently marked as fantasy logic. Carbon dioxide. Time in the little universe sped much faster than time in hers. Any minute now, the alarm should sound.

A yawn tugged at her lips, and she lifted a hand to stifle it. Where had she put her coffee? It was her favorite, an Antlia single-origin with a dash of Helix-brand non-dairy cream. She had actually saved up enough for a two-week trip there last year and had bought tons of the coffee. The farmers had been amazing, teaching her how to care for the plants and prune them, at least the ones they kept in the house as decoration. She had learned the difference between natural, washed, and honey processing.

At the time, it was just a fun excursion, an excuse to learn more about the drink that had become life. That changed when she got back to her experiment. She'd begun applying those lessons to her universe. She clipped a piece that wasn't work, a sad little galaxy that had tried but just couldn't grow. It had created a single star system and filled itself with nebula clouds. It would have killed her whole universe if she'd let it remain.

BRARGH! BRARGH! BRARGH!

A klaxon sounded as she found her mug. She snatched it, warm liquid splashing and staining her white lab coat as she rushed back to the monitor. She gulped down a bit of coffee. Calm. Breathe. Steady on.

She searched for the carbon dioxide sensor again. It had ballooned beyond what she thought possible. 125 percent. 130 percent. 150 percent. What was going on in her little universe?

She could check. Very rarely did she ever switch over to a live view of the internal camera she'd created—rather remarkable technology, too; it was an eye in the shape of a nebula—but it was there for emergencies. This qualified.

Fingers tapped on the monitor as she switched to the camera. She had it trained on one particular star system that seemed to be the most promising. The readings she'd pondered over yesterday had indicated some form of early carbon-based life. Maybe it had evolved?

The camera view filled the screen. Callista gasped. Her mug fell from her hand, shattering on the floor. This was... huge.

Sleek and slender metallic objects floated in the star system. Some powered away from the third rock from the star, others stayed locked in orbit. This wasn't early carbon-based life. This was sophisticated. They, whoever they were, were exploring beyond the little planet they'd come from.

Callista tugged at the edges of the bottom and pulled them out in a tight flare. She'd done it! She had taken her undergrad work—create a tiny universe—seeded it for her master's thesis, and life had formed. She'd recreated the Big Bang! Her dissertation was gonna be massive.

1q7kg5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1q7kg5u/how_to_hold_a_conversation_without_running_out_of/,How to Hold a Conversation Without Running Out of Things to Say: The Psychology-Based Guide That Actually Works,"You know that moment when you're talking to someone and suddenly your mind just... blanks? Like a computer screen freezing mid-sentence. You're standing there, mouth slightly open, brain screaming for literally anything to say, and all that comes out is ""so... yeah."" Painful, right?



I used to think I was just bad at conversations. Turns out, most people feel this way. After diving deep into communication research, psychology books, and studying how charismatic people actually talk (not the fake ""just be confident bro"" advice), I realized something: Running out of things to say isn't about being boring. It's about not having a system.



Here's what actually works.



 Step 1: Stop Trying to Be Interesting



Here's the paradox that'll blow your mind: The more you try to come up with interesting things to say, the faster you'll run out of material. Why? Because you're in your head, not in the conversation.



The shift: Stop performing. Start being curious.



The best conversationalists aren't the ones with endless stories. They're the ones who make OTHER people feel interesting. When you're genuinely curious about someone, you never run out of questions. And questions lead to topics. Topics lead to stories. Stories lead to connections.



Quick fix: Next conversation, set one rule for yourself. Ask three follow up questions before you talk about yourself. Watch what happens.



 Step 2: Master the Thread Technique



This is straight from Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi (bestselling networking bible, the guy literally built his career on conversation skills). Every statement someone makes has multiple threads you can pull on. Most people just let them hang there.



Someone says: ""I just got back from Colorado.""



Weak response: ""Oh cool.""



Thread pulling: You've got at least five threads here.

 What brought you to Colorado?

 How was the weather compared to here?

 Did you do any hiking or outdoor stuff?

 Was this your first time or do you go regularly?

 Are you more of a mountain person or beach person?



Each answer creates NEW threads. It's infinite. You literally cannot run out of things to say if you're paying attention to threads.



Pro move: When someone mentions anything, location, hobby, job, food, literally anything, there's a ""why"" question hiding in there. ""What made you get into that?"" or ""How'd that come about?"" are conversation gold.



 Step 3: Build Your Experience Bank



Look, if you do nothing, see no one, and experience nothing, yeah, you're gonna struggle with conversation. Not because you're boring, but because you've got nothing feeding your conversational well.



The fix: Consume interesting inputs. Read weird articles. Listen to podcasts about random topics. Try new restaurants. Take different routes home. Watch documentaries. The goal isn't to become a walking encyclopedia. It's to have a varied mental library to draw from.



I started using this app called Finch (it's technically a self care app with a cute bird, don't judge me). It gives you daily prompts and tiny challenges that get you doing small new things. Sounds silly but it actually helps you accumulate micro experiences that become conversation material.



BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content based on what you want to learn. Type in ""improve social skills"" or ""become a better conversationalist,"" and it generates a custom podcast with an adaptive learning plan tailored to your goals. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic style that makes learning feel less like a chore. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it's been useful for fitting real learning into commute time without needing to sit down with a full book.



Book rec that changed how I think about this: Range by David Epstein. This book destroys the myth that you need to be deeply specialized in one thing. Epstein shows how generalists, people with broad interests, actually have massive advantages in problem solving and yes, conversation. The research is insane. Scientists, artists, and successful people across fields all had one thing in common: diverse experiences. This book will make you question everything you think you know about expertise and make you feel way better about having multiple interests. Insanely good read.



 Step 4: Use the IFR Method (Inquire, Follow, Relate)



This is a system I picked up from studying improv comedy techniques. Yes, improv. Those people literally create conversations out of thin air.



Inquire: Ask an open ended question.  

Follow: Listen to the answer and ask a follow up based on what they said.  

Relate: Share something brief from your experience that connects.



Example:

 You: ""What's been taking up most of your time lately?"" (Inquire)

 Them: ""Honestly just trying to get better at cooking.""

 You: ""Oh interesting, what kind of cooking? Like specific cuisine or just general?"" (Follow)

 Them: ""I've been really into Thai food.""

 You: ""Dude, Thai food is no joke. I tried making pad thai once and it was a disaster. What's the hardest thing you've tried to make?"" (Relate + Inquire)



See how it flows? You're not monologuing. You're building together.



 Step 5: Embrace the Pause



This sounds counterintuitive but hear me out. Silence isn't your enemy. Awkward silence is only awkward if you make it awkward.



Confident people pause. They think before they speak. They let conversations breathe. When you're desperately trying to fill every second of silence, you come across as anxious. When you're comfortable with a beat of quiet, you seem confident.



The move: When there's a pause, take a breath. Smile slightly. Then either ask a question or make an observation about your surroundings. ""This coffee is actually really good"" or ""How do you know the host?"" or whatever fits. Pauses reset the conversation.



 Step 6: Have Go To Topics in Your Back Pocket



Yeah, having backup topics isn't cheating. It's smart. Charismatic people do this. They have mental categories they can pull from when conversation stalls.



The big five categories that almost always work:

 Travel/places: ""If you could live anywhere for a year, where would it be?""

 Food: ""What's your go to comfort food when you've had a rough day?""

 Childhood: ""What were you like as a kid?""

 Hypotheticals: ""Would you rather have the ability to fly or be invisible?""

 Passions: ""What's something you could talk about for hours without getting bored?""



Keep three of these loaded in your mental chamber. When things get quiet, fire one off.



 Step 7: Listen to How People Actually Talk



This might sound weird, but go listen to good podcast conversations. Not scripted interviews. Real flowing conversations. The Tim Ferriss Show is perfect for this. Ferriss is a master at pulling threads and keeping conversations going for hours. You'll notice he's not trying to be clever. He's just deeply curious and follows interesting threads.



Another one: WTF with Marc Maron. Maron makes people feel comfortable enough to go deep. His secret? He's vulnerable first. He shares his own awkwardness and struggles, which makes guests open up.



Study how they transition topics. How they circle back to earlier points. How they make connections between seemingly unrelated things. This is learnable.



 Step 8: Get Comfortable Sharing Small Vulnerabilities



The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down with actual neuroscience. When you share something slightly vulnerable, like ""Man, I totally blanked during that presentation yesterday,"" people's guards drop. They relate. They share back. Suddenly the conversation has depth.



You don't need to trauma dump. Just be human. Mention small struggles, funny failures, or honest opinions. It gives people permission to do the same.



 Step 9: Practice in Low Stakes Situations



You know where I got better at conversation? Talking to baristas, Uber drivers, and people in grocery store lines. Low stakes. No pressure. If it goes nowhere, who cares? You'll never see them again.



But here's what happened: I got comfortable with the rhythm of small talk. I learned which questions led somewhere and which ones died. I figured out my natural style. By the time I was in situations that mattered, conversations felt easier.



Your homework: This week, have one unnecessary conversation with a stranger. Coffee shop, wherever. Just practice.



 Step 10: Stop Fearing the End of Conversations



Not every conversation needs to last forever. Some conversations are meant to be five minutes. And that's okay. The pressure you feel to keep things going indefinitely is made up.



If a conversation naturally ends, you can literally just say ""Well, it was really nice talking to you"" and exit like a normal human. No one's judging you for ending a conversation. They're probably relieved too.



The goal isn't to talk forever. It's to make the time you do talk feel genuine and connected.



 Real talk for a second



Running out of things to say isn't a personality flaw. It's a skill gap. And skills can be built. You're not broken. You just haven't learned the mechanics yet. Every smooth talker you see had to learn this stuff too. Some figured it out naturally. Others, like most of us, had to be intentional about it.



Start with one technique from this list. Just one. Try it in your next three conversations. See what happens. Build from there. You'll be surprised how fast this becomes natural.

I am a 23 year old woman and a true introvert who feels most myself in quiet, low-stimulation environments. Crowded places, loud events, and the need to constantly socialize leave me completely drained. I recharge best in solitude or with one person who understands that comfortable silence is just as valuable as conversation.

My days usually involve working remotely on creative projects, reading novels or poetry for hours, listening to soft indie or acoustic playlists through headphones, watching thoughtful films or series that linger in my mind, journaling whatever thoughts come up, brewing coffee or tea while lost in daydreams, or taking long walks in the evening when the world feels quieter. I love discussions that dive straight into meaningful topics like emotions, books that changed us, music that captures a mood perfectly, quiet observations about life, dreams, or philosophy, but only when they unfold naturally and without pressure.

I am looking for another introvert, preferably a guy between 22 and 33, who also prefers depth and tranquility over constant activity. Someone who is comfortable with a slow pace, who does not expect nonstop messaging or immediate energy, and who enjoys thoughtful exchanges more than frequent small talk. I imagine us starting with messages about what we are reading or listening to that day, perhaps sharing a song or quote that resonated, and gradually moving to longer voice notes or calm calls where pauses feel safe and natural.

For me, attraction develops slowly from feeling emotionally understood and secure first. I am reserved and take time to open up, but once I feel safe I become warm, affectionate, attentive, and deeply loyal. I love gentle forms of closeness like sitting side by side while each lost in our own book, resting my head on your shoulder during a quiet movie, or walking together without needing to fill every moment with words.

I am not here for casual dating or high-pressure interactions. I want to find one person who also feels overwhelmed by typical dating scenes and would rather let something authentic and private grow quietly over time.

If you are introspective, gentle, value the beauty of quiet companionship, and are hoping to meet a fellow introvert for a peaceful and meaningful connection, please message me.

Tell me your age, how you typically spend your quiet time, a book, album, or film that has stayed with you recently, and a little about what being an introvert means to you day to day. I am looking forward to hearing from someone who appreciates the slow, thoughtful way real connections can form.",3,1767898362.0,IntrovertDating,3,0.64,False

Life feels settled in a good way, and I’m at the point where I can really enjoy getting to know someone and see where it naturally leads without forcing anything.

I'm 28 and from England. I spend my days with a mix of work, hobbies, and the little things that make life enjoyable. I work for myself so I have flexibility, and I spend a lot of time cooking proper meals, baking when I want to switch off, keeping active with the gym or running, or going on walks that sometimes turn into hikes by accident.

(Homeschooling is a cult might be a good book title.) 

I am amazed at the group-think that goes on in homeschool circles.  One cannot have a dissenting opinion or they are immediately ostracized amongst the group.  Or if they do have that opinion, they keep it under strict lock and key.

For example, I remember the homeschool groups loving certain martial arts, like judo, jiu jutsu, etc, for reasons listed such as discipline, hard-working, family could do it together, etc.  But, the same group would not be okay with any team sports, mainly lamenting that popular culture/social media makes those parents crazy, wanting to win at all costs, super competitive and MAINSTREAM.  So, anything outside of the norm was within homeschoolers' purview, but anything MAINSTREAM was terrible.

This is just one example.  Other examples include: regular eggs/white bread (organic only, raising own chickens best, sourdough), diet soda (kombucha, tea, coffee, water), public/parochial school (Apogee, Acton, Coops etc), ""I'm feeling overwhelmed"" (just do less is only acceptable answer), and so forth.

Good luck understanding what actually matters or how it affects your work. We built Doculearn to solve this with automated flashcards. Here's how it works: 

Every time code is pushed, you get bite-sized flashcards: - What changed - Why it matters - Who needs to know Instead of reading through commit messages and diffs, you swipe through quick cards during your coffee break. 

Takes 2 minutes to stay completely in sync with your team. The result: - No more ""wait, when did we change that?"" - No more meetings just to sync on what shipped - Everyone actually knows what's happening in the codebase It's like having a smart digest of everything your team does, but actually consumable instead of overwhelming. 

We're offering free trials if anyone wants to try it. Honestly just built this because we were drowning in commits and Slack messages. Curious - how does everyone else handle staying updated when your team moves fast?

But the second it goes on LinkedIn? Robotized corporate speak.

Is it a time thing? Legal breathing down their neck? Do they just not give a shit about LinkedIn and I'm the weird one for caring?

By the glass.

Very, very young.

Tight and a lot of tannins and acidity.

Good amount of dark blue and red fruits, slight rosemary.

92+ points. 

Then for the mains, Viña Tondonia and a Napa Cab, which was shockingly well-priced!

Decanted and drank over an hour.

First time trying this vintage by the bottle.

Dark fruits, chocolate, coffee notes. Slight clove and vanilla as well, but no coconut. Over time, picked up leather and tobacco notes.

Enjoyable wine, likely needs even more time.

90 points. 

**2020 Snowden Cabernet Sauvignon Dum Spiro Spero**

Decanted and drank over two hours.

I was surprised how much I enjoyed this.

Lovely wine giving all the trademarks of a finer Napa at a more reasonable price.

Dark cherry, blueberry, graphite, plum notes.

Still a little tight, but definitely approachable given the age.

No smoke taint whatsoever.

91 points.

Then closed out the night with some Sauternes!

**2020 Petit Guiraud**

Craving a Sauternes and restaurant offered this at a reasonable price.

Drinking nicely now, at a young age.

Apricot, marmalade, hazelnut notes.

Not as complex as other Sauternes I've had, including Suduiraut, but still enjoyable.

1q7k1ze,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q7k1ze,"Stop sleeping on your iPad for Shoppable Videos. The new ""CapCut Pad"" update + Sora 2 integration basically changed my entire workflow (Real talk + specific tips)","# Stop sleeping on your iPad for Shoppable Videos. The new ""CapCut Pad"" update + Sora 2 integration basically changed my entire workflow (Real talk + specific tips)

I’ve been grinding on the Amazon Influencer program for a while, and like most of you, I’ve been stuck in that annoying middle ground: editing on my iPhone feels cramped and imprecise, but dragging out my MacBook and firing up Premiere for a 45-second vertical video feels like total overkill.

I recently overhauled my setup based on the late 2025 updates, specifically around the new **CapCut Pad** (the standalone iPad OS version, not the blown-up mobile app) and the new hardware integration.

If you are churning out volume for onsite commissions, here is the value-heavy breakdown of why this specific combo is currently winning, plus one massive **""red flag"" warning** you need to know so you don't brick your device.

# 1. The Interface is Finally ""Desktop-Class""

If you tried editing on an iPad a year ago, it was just the iPhone app stretched out. That’s gone. The new **CapCut Pad version** (released Dec 16, 2025) creates a dedicated workspace that actually utilizes multi-track editing properly.

* **Why it matters for us:** You can finally drag and drop assets between apps. I use **Stage Manager** to keep my script/product notes open on one side and drag B-roll files directly from the Files app into the timeline. No more ""Camera Roll"" chaos.

# 2. Apple Pencil Pro is actually useful now (Not a gimmick)

I thought the Pencil was just for artists, but the new integration with the M4/Pro iPads is wild for editing speed.

* **Hover:** You can hover the pencil 12mm over the timeline to preview *exactly* where the playhead will land before you touch the screen. It makes splitting clips frame-perfect without that ""undo, retry, undo"" loop.
* **Squeeze:** You can squeeze the pencil barrel to bring up your tool palette instantly (switch from cut to select) without moving your hand to the bottom menu.
* **Barrel Roll:** If you use text overlays or arrows to point at product features, you can rotate the pencil to rotate the object on screen. It’s way faster than using two fingers to pinch-rotate.

# 3. The ""Cheat Code"": AI B-Roll with Sora 2 & Veo 3.1

This is the biggest ROI tip. We all have those moments where we film a review but realize we forgot a specific transition shot or a generic ""cozy living room"" background shot.

CapCut Desktop and Pad now integrate **Google Veo 3.1** and **OpenAI’s Sora 2** directly into the ""AI Media"" tab.

* **The Workflow:** Instead of reshooting, you can type *""cinematic close up of coffee steam in morning light""* and generate 1080p/4K B-roll in seconds.
* **Note:** Sora 2 allows for up to 25-second clips if you are on Pro, which is usually enough for an intro or background layer.

# 4. The ""Amazon Safe Zone"" Fix

Since the iPad screen is bigger, it's easy to forget that Amazon's mobile UI covers the bottom 25% of your video with the ""Add to Cart"" and ""Product Title"" overlays.

* **The Fix:** In CapCut Pad, go to **Grid** \> **Safe Zone** and select the ""TikTok/Reels"" preset (it's close enough to Amazon's layout).
* **Rule:** Never put your captions or key visual elements in the bottom third. The iPad makes it easy to visualize this compared to a tiny phone screen.

# 5. The Massive Warning (Read this seriously)

There is a known issue with how iOS/iPadOS handles ""sandbox"" storage for video apps. CapCut is notorious for caching deleted projects. I saw a thread where a guy with a 2TB iPhone had 800GB of ""System Data"" eaten up by CapCut even after deleting projects.

* **The Fix:** Do not use CapCut as your storage drive. Finish your Amazon video, export it, upload it to Amazon/Storefront, and then **delete the project from the app immediately**. If the storage doesn't clear, you have to uninstall and reinstall the app. Keep your raw files on an external SSD or proper cloud storage, not inside the app container.

# The Verdict:

If you are doing high-volume shoppable videos, the **iPad M4 + CapCut Pad** is currently the fastest workflow I’ve found. It bridges the gap between ""phone quality"" and ""desktop effort.""

**Quick note on the Pro version:** You can do 90% of this on the free version, but if you want the Sora 2 AI generation (for fake B-roll) and the Cloud Sync (start on phone, finish on iPad), you do need the Pro sub.

If you want to test out the Pro features (like the AI background removal which saves me buying a green screen), here is a link to the [7-day trial of CapCut Pro](https://capcutaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/6787791/1876067/22474).

*Full disclosure: That’s an affiliate link, but I only recommend it because the AI tools literally save me hours of reshooting time every week.*

I feel really weird right now. So in short I met my current boyfriend on a cruise 2 weeks after he got back from his mission. He went to BYU and I stayed in Texas for school. We were long distance. For the first year and a half I was interested in the church and wanted to convert. But I didn’t end up converting for a LIST of reasons.

• kept getting revelation that the church is false

• 10% tithing 

• racist history 

• sexist history 

• Joseph Smith con artist history 

• polygamy history 

• the awful feeling I would get when i would get a      priesthood blessing 

• the purity culture 

• tmi I know but not being able to masturbate, (I started exploring the church like 4 months after I learned how to and had my first O) 

• not being able to drink tea

• not being able to drink 

• not being able to drink coffee 

• having to wear garments the rest of my life 

• not being able to dress however the hell I want 

• the judgment of other members 

• I’m very pro choice 

• his parents 

• the church not being supportive of the LGBTGIA+ community (I have so many friends in that community that I would die for and the church’s stance is GARBAGE 

This list is in no particular order btw 

Anyways. So a year and a half into dating, that Christmas his mom gifted me a quad (I had very mixed feelings as you could imagine). And I started reading the quad from the beginning everyday for the first 3 months I got it (I started to develop a sort of religious ocd). I investigated the church from April 2024 until February 2025 (I got the quad on December 2024) my bf and I met in July 2023). 

So in February/ March of 2025 I told my bf that I don’t believe in the church/ I can’t go into the church, and I feel like I would have to mask myself. I told him I would mind being baptized but I would never get endowed or sealed. This was essentially a deal breaker for him and he had to pray about it. And initially he said that it breaks his heart but we’re just so compatible that he wants to be with me so that’s fine because I would still go to church and yada yada. Around February I started preying that he would leave the church. I would prey every morning and night with tears in my eyes that he would realize that the church isn’t true. 

Anyway I’m going to forward and say that after many tough conversations, we realized that we wanted to be with each other. And my boyfriend was a Jack Mormon/ social mormon (he didn’t go to church, drank, cursed, did sexual stuff (with me of course), stopped wearing his garments, stopped preying, stopped reading scriptures) he didn’t do anything Mormon other than identify with the Mormon church. So in November 2025 I started referring to him as a social Mormon. And then the church said that they were going to start allowing women at 18 to go on their missions. And that’s what broke his shelf. He raged about how the church didn’t care for women’s safety, and how this will decrease the number of women going to school, and this is a clear ploy to increase young marriage and have more kids so they could have more members. And how this is careless for young women. 

He said that he’s no longer identifies with the church. And he now believes in analytical idealism (idk what that is entirely and it’s so new in concept that there’s not too many resources on it). We went engagement ring shopping after that, and that thanksgiving he told his parents that he’s leaving the church. And now all of a sudden (btw I went no contact with them from January 2025 until December 2025 they were getting mean) they wanted to talk to me. And initially the conversation went well until they became manipulative and talked about how a priesthood blessing saved my bf’s life (and not the hospital with medical staff) and they were crying about it and it was lowkey making me feel icky. Anyways his mom said that when we started dating she knew that it could only go 2 ways, that my bf was going to leave the church or I was going to join the church (but when I tried to join the church she would make backhanded comments that I was only doing it for my bf and that I was clearly fake, girl whatever). And before they left they said that they were going to pray for us to come back to the church. 

So now I feel weird about god (which idk if I fully believe in) because every time I have ever pray, my prayers were answered. A kid I hardly knew who was in a 2 month coma, I prayed and he came out of it the next day, my dad ended up beating cancer, and my boyfriend left the church. Now I know the church isn’t true. I feel like no matter what I do his parents will always blame me for leaving the church even though he has had mixed feelings about the church for about 8 years now. I told his mom after she made that comment that my bf was always going to leave the church whether I was in his life or not because my bf was always going to challenge his beliefs and that’s when they brought up that priesthood blessing story. 

How do I do this? How do I support my bf’s deconstruction? How do I help him with all of his feelings about religion and family? How do I deal with my future in-laws bringing up the church for the rest of our lives (of course I’ll be respectful and pray with them at meal time especially in their own home, and I won’t kick down at the church in front of them)? How do I escape the accusation that I was the reason my bf left the church? Idk how to do this and sometimes I feel overwhelmed about it. I love my bf and I feel so thankful that everything ended up working out in my favor I just know that his parents will always resent me and no matter how much I wish they would accept me I know that they won’t. 

TLDR: boyfriend left the church, I need advice on how to be supportive during deconstruction and how to deal with future in-laws blaming me of him leaving the church/ never accepting me. 

Please don’t just say, “oh forget them!” They are smart people and they would do anything to still be involved in their only son’s life. Thank you ",26,1767897555.0,exmormon,18,0.97,False

So, about two years ago, me ( M23 ) and this girl worked together, things were fine, she was sweet all the time and stuff, we had one…I wouldn’t call this “date”, but we went to grabbed some tea and went to cat cafe. At the end of this “date” she kissed my cheek, lost my scarf and got me a new one a few weeks after. I don’t remember exactly what happened, but in about a month she started to communicate less. My friend asked her and told me that this girl likes me but have some bad stuff going on in her life and used to deal with it on her own. And soon enough she quit the job and we haven’t communicated since then. So last summer she returned to work to our place, but to other department. We saw each other a few times during work, but all these times I didn’t really interacted with her. So, at the end of December we had a work party. After I arrived and started to talk with some colleagues, she joined our conversation, greeted me, asked me how I was doing. I mentioned that i currently study finance at university and she said like “yeah I remember you wanted to study at this field”. I don’t get it, did she remember this detail two years ago? So, after that, she came to me first a few times to tell something, but I don’t remember what, music was too loud. At the end of the party we had a warm conversation, she asked me where I live and she mentioned that she moved to live to other part of city. When her taxi arrived, she hugged everyone, but when it was my turn, I believe there was a little pause from her before hug. When I got home I wrote to her that I was happy to see her and will definitely visit cafe where she works to grab some coffee. She said that she was happy to see me as well and apologized for not being in the best condition. At the end of the message she said, “ We are waiting for you to visit :) ”.

I ain’t tryin’ to convince nobody. Learned a long time ago that’s a waste of breath. Folks gonna love their screens and updates and shiny bullshit no matter what I say. That’s fine. Ain’t my job.

Cars used to make sense though. That part I’ll stand on. Hood up, hands dirty, little cussin’, little patience. You listened to ‘em. They told you what was wrong if you weren’t in such a damn hurry. Now you need permission from a computer to do anything. Hell with that. Ain’t progress if I can’t fix it myself.

—exhale, faint smirk—
Music was better too. Don’t care who hears it. Grunge sounded like truth — raw, pissed, tired, honest. Southern voices got that twang ‘cause we ain’t rushin’ our words. We say what we mean and let it sit. Same way trades guys talk. You don’t fill the air just to feel important.

“That’ll work.”
“Nope, do it again.”
“Leave it.”

That’s all that needs sayin’.

I don’t hate people. I actually like ‘em — when they ain’t performin’. I like coffee with no phones on the table. A drink that stays right where it is. Mornings where the sun comes up whether anyone’s payin’ attention or not. That shit still feels right.

World’s loud now. Too many choices. Too much sellin’. Everybody actin’ like newer means better. I ain’t buyin’ it. Never did.

I don’t need more.
I need enough.

1q7jwop,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1q7jwop/small_rantvent_about_my_partners/,Small rant/vent about my partners,"Sorry if this isn't allowed; I just have to vent, and I don't really have anybody IRL I can talk to.


So I'm still pretty green, only been about 4 months with the Siren but I feel pretty confident in my abilities and I know my way around by now. This other person (we'll call her S) is also new, only about a month and a half, maybe two. S and I usually get along just fine, joking and laughing. All of us who work there are pretty friendly with each other.

Today I come into work and I'm in the back to start out, cause stuff back there needs to be done and I'm obviously available and not doing anything else. S comes in a little over an hour later and immediately heads out to the floor. We're hit with an unexpected rush a little while later so N asks if I can come help with some things. 

I go and I'm helping R with DTO, N is on warming, while P and S are on bar 1 and 2. S is apparently having trouble keeping up with bar 2 so N takes over that, has S go to the cold bar, and I go to warming. Everything is going great, we're churning out orders like a well-oiled machine.

I'm running food because our ovens are on the complete opposite side of the room from the counter. I'm focused and I will admit I've been told that if I'm not making an effort to look pleasant, I have a bitch face. I have autism, my face just does that if I'm not consciously smiling, which I am not doing because I'm focused on food. However, I do still smile at the customers and say thank you.

Anyway, I'm jogging back to my oven because I hear it beeping when I hear S come over the headset to say ""You know, having an attitude doesn't help any of us get through this."" I'm confused but feel like this is aimed at me for some reason so I look up and N and I make eye contact both of us looking confused. Nobody says anything though.

A while later and we're slowing down again. I'm back at the window helping out and we're waiting on a tall coffee frappuccino with whip. It's taking a while so I go to hand it out without really looking at it when the customer points out it has caramel on top and asks if it's a coffee frappuccino. I turn and ask S, ""It's a coffee frap, right?"" She just stares at me, so I ask again, still no answer. I apologize to the customer and ask for just a moment, I go over to the frap station and take off the lid, and scoop off the caramel. I sniff it to make sure it's correct and put a new whip on. I hand it out and S scoffs and says ""You didn't have to do that, I could've fixed it.""

Second issue.

Partner P doesn't seem to like me very much and idk if I should be taking it personally. First she never *asks* me to do things, just sorta demands. Still in the middle of the rush while I am working through warming, she gets on the headset to say ""Go grab me milk."" ""Go get syrups."" I have no problem running to the back to grab people things if I'm closer/more available than anybody else. But most people toss a please or thank you in there.

During the slowing down of our rush, I'm in the middle of saying it looks like we're out of something and she cuts me off to say ""Get more then."" N pops in to say he already grabbed some earlier but they need time to thaw, she just huffs and doesn't say anything.

She never talks to me unless it's to demand I grab something and I feel weird about stuff that seems like she's purposely leaving me out.

During our slow time yesterday, she drew little portraits on cup sleeves. She did one for K, N, and C. They're talking about them and she makes eye contact as she says she did one for everybody (not me though.) Then today it's me, R, S, and P on the floor, and it's slow. She makes a mystery cold foam for just R and S to try and puts herself in the middle of the circle with her back to me.

I don't wanna sound childish like ""Waa waa she's leaving me out"" but it does feel weirdly personal but I don't know why it would be. As far as I know, I haven't done anything to warrant this behavior. Appreciate any insight or second opinions from people, and good luck out there lol",4,1767897366.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False

Since around age 8 I knew something was wrong with me. At age 11 I started drinking monsters all the time. My mom wouod give me a few bucks to walk to the dollar store for coffee for her or other things and told me I could get myself something too, for going for her. 

I'd always get the 4 packs of monsters and I'd be drinking 2 a day frequently. As I got older I would start drinking the biggest size monster available, all the time. This would continue until I was about 16 or 17. Monster stopped tasting good to me, and I'd mostly drink coffee or water, occasionally other drinks like rockstar.  When I moved out of my family's house, I tried to be more health conscious but when I discovered alani and celsius or ""healthy"" energy drinks I could not resist. I especially like alani. I would have 1 a day and then 2 a day when it wasn't enough, sometimes 3. 

I got back to just 1 after taking a huge caffeine break but didn't see much of a change. I think it was due to the timing and stress at work.

I love that Met Market has the cheapest coffee in Ballard (I haven't found one cheaper yet). And that on Cyber Monday I can get $400 of gift cards to Town and Country (Ballard Market) for $300 and then instantly pair that with their $20 off coupon, essentially making $100 of their bougie groceries only $55!!

What am I missing though? I rarely dine in Old Ballard bc it all seems too pricey (I'm still in shock that people pay $130 for a steak here and the places I have gone to are way too mid imo for the $$$-$$$$, and let's not talk about the pizza prices) but maybe I'm missing some hidden happy hours, a side dish that's actually an amazing meal, or a certain day that has a worthy discount. I like the smaller, slightly off the Ave restaurants (maybe bc they're cheaper and hit the spot): Arashi, Pestle Rock, Mr. Gyros, Pink Bee (I might be the only person who doesn't like the indian fast food place next to Pink Bee, I tried 3x and that was enough), even Salmon Bay Cafe... but I'm not opposed to trying an app or dessert elsewhere if it's a good deal. And it doesn't have to be just food focused. Like I absolutely love that Mox Boarding House let's you try any game for free in the main area (last time I went at least) or that classpass gives you 2 weeks free at various gyms around Ballard. Or that Sacred Rain has 10-visit punch cards that essentially makes it $15 cheaper then a daily visit (and same for the Asian Foot Massage place on Market...kinda near the Pho place, sorry brain fog--they're buy 5 massages get 1 free is great).

1q7jhf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueDetective/comments/1q7jhf5/did_maggie_have_knowledge_of_carcosa/,Did Maggie have knowledge of Carcosa?,"I believe it’s possible that Maggie had knowledge of Carcosa and the Yellow King and that she knew what Marty and Rust were working on. 

First time I thought of this was from the 2002 timeline, when Maggie visited Rust for her revenge-tour, she saw all of the Carcosa materials on Rust’s walls and table in his apartment and was immediately flabbergasted. She even asked “what is all this?”, but she probably did that because she was nervous as to what he was getting into. 

The second time I thought about this is when Marty visits Maggie for the last time. She asks if he likes his coffee black, and he said “no, I’ll take green tea if you have it.” Within a second or two, Maggie hands him his cup of green tea. How is it possible that she made him the green tea so quickly? Is it possible she had planned to give him the green tea as a way to tip him off about the green paint and the green ears? Is that how Marty knew to ask “why green ears?”

I don’t know yet how Maggie knew about Carcosa, but if you think about it it starts to make sense more and more. She was a local girl, of course. She grew up in this area and probably knew many of the local customs, including the Mardi Gras events that were held on the Tuttle farm. Maggie also worked for a hospital - is it possible that the hospital was funded by the Tuttle foundation? ",0,1767896469.0,TrueDetective,8,0.33,False

And i got to experience so many things irl for the first time. I'm just a girl from a small town in the middle of nowhere with heavily conservative and religious values okay? Don't laugh when i tell you these😭

Tall women😳

This is the second time but blonde women>_<

Gingers

Ppl with piercings, tattoos pink, purple and green hair *panic*

Bars. I went to an actual bar! Holy cow! 

Fire works 

City lights 

I SAW AND WENT TO A CHURCH! 

Seeing women in workout outfits (save lives) in the gym

City decorations for new year. 

Christmas costumes, songs etc

New year's celebrations, santa, Christmas trees.. 

I met *actual* queer ppl irl 😭

Queer gatherings, watching movies etc. 

It was crazy how quickly i became friends with them! Maybe it's not the same everywhere but here the queer community is so freaking active and i love it! We have events, drag shows etc! And we exchange our socials pretty easily and sometimes go out for some coffee and stuff! 

One thing I've noticed irl compared to online queer spaces is that they do not give a fuck about labels or pronouns. Rarely so. They don't let the labels define them (in regards to my latest post, they all just play Diane lol) or restrict them but also respect other people's identities. And we listen to each other and hear each other out! 

I guess the key takeaway is this; there's less drama and less judgment and more acceptance irl compared to online queer spaces and i think that's a good thing! I know how scary Internet can be and how it might shape our view or force stereotypes and for some, online spaces are the only place for them to feel a sense of belonging and community. I have been there for a long time and i get how scary it can be. I also met some queer ppl who were in a difficult situation, being homeless, pre hrt and they thought the world was against them. Even in a city like >!Yerevan!< where queer life blooms even if it's done in the underground, they isolate themselves and become bitter. It breaks my heart to see them like this bc i was once like them too. Some of them would also say that they don't relate to queer community as a community don't want to be around them etc. And that just reminded me of the time where I was thinking I'm one of the good ones and not like those other gays :<<<. If it wasn't for the love and support of my friends, i think I'd still be in that place. I know i can't hold everyone's pain but i just wish I could help them. I know how fucked up the feeling of not getting gender affirming care is. This is where I saw that gender affirming care does indeed saves lives. 

I also went on a date with this enby person! My first ever date!!! Even though i was broke af lol. They suggested that we should hang out on IG and i agreed and after a couple of days before the date the realization hit me like a dummy ""oh shit this is a date💀"" lol i tried not to panic too much. We went to a nice cafe and had a great conversation and i really liked them. We hugged after and went home and promised to hang out more some other time! Honestly i don't mind if we remained friends i appreciated our time together and still wanna be friends with them. Girls and enbys, dating can be so nice i didn't know 😭

There is a lot of things i wanna say. Like the feeling of being stuck and feeling like getting out is impossible, or you'll gonna die in this place closeted and the impact of the environment has on you. But I don't want to make this too long.

Ex: 7 day fast, then 3 hr refeed, the begin fasting again. Right after that refeed ends, is it sort of like restarting the clock on autophagy? Is it dependent or not on level of ketosis?","Where in for example around roughly 13, 15  ~17 hrs x happens, up into 24 x is likely happening, 48 x is happening, Day 3, etc?

Or does it restart, it's just it may get back higher sooner into that same high level of autophagy since I had just spent 7 days fasting and it was likely already very high right before the 1st refeed (which was ""short"" 3 hrs long)?

Or does it likely take about the same amount of time to reach the same depth level of autophagy?

Is the level of autophagy it reaches in an amount of time related to how long and deep I am into ketosis, or does that not matter much to the depth level of autophagy?

Basically, I did 7 days of fasting (tea, coffee, water electrolytes), refeed lightly for 3-4 hrs, went right back into fasting and plan to for at least another week or more. And am wondering:

- if I should probably think of the rough levels/timeline (based on research) of autophagy starting over again at the same rate, 

- or likely starting over again, but may reach the deeper level of autophagy sooner since the fast was 7 days and only did a light and short refeed)

- if level of ketosis, ketones or blood glucose matter, 

- or if the autophagy level likely didn't change at all (thinking unlikely)?

Are there disadvantages to restarting an ""autophagy timeline"" (for lack of good terminology), if the main goal is to lose fat?  (For example, if I was aiming for a 21 day fast, but did a rolling,short 3 hrs refeed at day 7, and went straight back into the fast, would whatever happens after with autophagy have disadvantages of the goal os fat loss, vs. if I had stayed fasting the whole time, or longer into the fast?",3,1767896401.0,fasting,2,1.0,False

[](https://x.com/GABAtelepsych/status/2009324165762093185/photo/1)

[How to Implement Good Sleep Hygiene?](https://preview.redd.it/lzpzg8ah36cg1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d4acc90fe59319f0c270cf882b5c414105cc724)

There are many small and big steps you can take to improve your sleep habits.  
  
**Some of the following strategies to develop good sleep hygiene:**  
  
\- **Consistent sleep schedule**: *Set a bedtime and wake-up time and stick to it, including on the weekends. This helps regulate your body’s internal clock, leading to better sleep quality, mood regulation, and even improving work performance.*  
  
\- **Establish a relaxing pre-sleep routine**: *Take a warm bath or shower, read a book, meditate for a bit, or practice deep breathing exercises. Activities like these slow your heart rate and calm your mind, signaling to your brain that it’s time to sleep.*  
  
\- **Digital Detox**: *Turn off your screens one hour before you go to bed. The blue light from your screen (e.g., phone, tablet, laptop) stops your body from making melatonin. Melatonin is what helps you fall asleep.*   
  
\- **Exercise regularly**: *Exercise helps you sleep better. However, you should not do intense exercise within 1-2 hours of going to bed.*  
  
\- **Eat a balanced diet**: *Try to opt for easy-to-digest food in the evening and avoid oily, spicy, or heavy meals that trigger digestive issues, such as indigestion or heartburn.*  
  
\- **Limit Stimulants**: *You should really cut back on things like coffee, tea, cola, or other caffeine drinks in the afternoon and evening. Caffeine can keep you feeling alert when you should be relaxing.*   
  
\- **Cut down on alcohol**: *Alcohol can make you feel calm, but it also messes up your sleep. Consumption of alcohol at night actually disrupts the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep patterns.*  
  
However, if improving your lifestyle doesn’t help you with sleep, consult a psychiatrist who can chart out a treatment plan for you. Sleep patterns differ from one person to another, and so does the treatment plan.  
  
***Since sleep patterns are subjective, a psychiatrist may modify the plan according to your lifestyle, biology, and stress levels.***

I’m thinking of starting a small, neighbourhood-only home food setup — mainly good café-style coffee (that’s my strong suit), plus maybe:

	•	Simple pastas

	•	Snacks / comfort meals

	•	Some healthier options if there’s demand

Important bit:

I don’t want to charge café-level prices. Cafes already overcharge enough 😅

The idea is better quality than instant / average café coffee, but at a lower, fair price, since there’s no fancy rent or aggregator cuts.

Before I even consider this, I’d love to understand how you think about it:

1️⃣ Would you order coffee / food from a trusted home setup nearby instead of cafés or Zomato/Swiggy?

2️⃣ What price point would feel “worth it” to you for:

	•	A well-made coffee

	•	Fresh, home-prepared food

3️⃣ What would make you not order? (hygiene, consistency, timing, etc.)

This isn’t a promo - just trying to see if this makes sense for the neighbourhood ( khopat / Runwal nagar area) or not.

Your answers will genuinely shape whether I go ahead or drop the idea.

Thanks! 🙌

Not in a dramatic way, just this sudden “oh no” feeling in my chest. Which makes no sense, because it’s three dollars. I’ve tipped more than that without thinking. But the second I saw it, my brain went straight into detective mode.

What is this. Why is it here. Did I forget something. Is there another one coming. Is this the start of something annoying.

I didn’t even do anything productive about it. I just kept opening my bank app like it was going to explain itself if I stared long enough. I scrolled through emails, checked old subscriptions, tried to mentally replay the last few days. All of that energy, over an amount I wouldn’t blink at on a normal day.

Nothing was actually wrong. It turned out to be some tiny app charge I’d already forgotten about. That should’ve been the end of it, but my nervous system didn’t seem to get that update. I stayed weirdly tense and distracted for a while after, and I remember thinking, why is this bothering me so much.

Later that night I told a friend about it and the way it came out was so absurd that we both just started laughing. Like, I could hear how unhinged it sounded once I said it out loud. And after the laughter died down, he said something like, “Honestly, you’re not stressed about the money. You’re stressed about not knowing what’s coming.”

That stuck with me. He ended up recommending a tool that he’d been using. He described it as something that just watches balances, bills, subscriptions, and timing in the background so you don’t have to interrogate every random charge like it’s a threat. I was skeptical, but I figured I’d try anything that might stop my brain from spiraling over coffee-money amounts.

What surprised me was how much calmer those moments got. I still notice charges, but they don’t hijack my entire mood anymore. Seeing that most of these tiny things are just one-offs, not the start of a chain reaction, made it easier to let them go.

It’s funny how money stress works. It’s almost never about the amount. It’s about being caught off guard. And apparently, at one point in my life, my brain thought three dollars was a very serious ambush.",1,1767896239.0,stories,0,1.0,False
