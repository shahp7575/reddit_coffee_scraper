1r8tv6y,https://i.redd.it/0a4jcsmowekg1.jpeg,How accurate is the Polar H10 for VO2max testing?,"Hi everyone,

I’m trying to understand how accurate the Polar H10 is when it comes to VO2max estimation.

This morning I did the Polar Fitness Test right after waking up, completely fasted, no coffee, and no training the day before. The result came back at 66 VO2max. The 2 tests before indicated 63 and 65.

For context:

* Height: 175 cm (5'9"")
* Weight: 79 kg (174 lbs)
* Body fat: \~17%

The thing is, this doesn’t seem to match my actual running performance. Here are my recent race times:

* 18 km (11.2 miles, forest / cross-type terrain): 1h45
* 15 km (9.3 miles): 1h30
* 10 km (6.2 miles): 50'
* 5 km (3.1 miles): 25'
* 3 km (1.86 miles): 15'
* 1 km (0.62 miles): 4'

Based on these times, 66 seems very high.

Thanks in advance for your insights!",1,1771489896.0,Polarfitness,0,1.0,False

My ex (22M) and I (22F) broke up in mid-November after a great 1.5-year relationship (we're not from the US). No drama – he wasn't sure about his feelings, I was drained and needed space. We decided to stay friends because we care a lot about each other and think highly of one another.

We've met a few times since (coffee, studying) – always fun, lots of laughs, same great chemistry. He acts just like before with me.

But every hangout, he mentions hanging out with other girls (group stuff with his best friend – studying, movies, etc.), then trashes them hard: ""they're basically dudes,"" ""ugly,"" ""disgusting."" He even said New Year's was just him and guy friends, no girls.

He also texted me from a family trip abroad for eSIM help (could've easily Googled it), sent a nostalgic pic of cookies we shared, and offered to bring some back. Planning casual coffee to exchange them when he returns.

I'm not jealous – happy he's living his life, feeling healthy post-breakup. But why badmouth every other girl to my face? Why reach out for tiny things?

I and my boyfriend take care of his little brother (13M), we can call him S. Their mother passed away when he was 6 years old. My boyfriend, T, is the oldest of 5, but only share the same mom with S and another brother (21, E). S's father passed away around the same time, he was never in the picture. T had been raising all of them until last June. E had been problematic since who knows when, his family says he has always been like this. He is very argumentative, he got into an altercation with T leaving behind bruises on his neck and shoulder area. He was trying to grow weed in the house because his income was solely from selling it. We practically had to beg him to clean up after himself and his dog. His dog peed in the house, hardly walked him, showed him off as his emotional support dog, it actually left behind a poo on my coffee table once. E would never do his dishes, just leave them until their grandmother came down and did them herself. Was loud in the middle of the night and would smoke indoors. Their family just enabled E's behavior and would guilt trip T about making E do anything, paying rent, etc.

We eventually moved out of state, I had always wanted to move somewhere colder, but it was the only way for them to take us seriously. We were going to just move to another house, but their grandmother and aunt said we would have to bring E with us. We moved 12hrs away. They were furious, saying that we rushed (we planned to do this for awhile now, just never communicated it). I do not see them in a good light, I don't think they see me in one either, which is whatever. 

His aunt, F, wants to come up to surprise S for his middle school graduation. She didn't mention who exactly would be coming up, but she has 4 kids. The thing is we were actually planning on coming down the day after his graduation for a week to see everyone and because we were not able to bring everything up with us, so we have some things with his dad and my parents, plus my grandmother was going to come up and drop some stuff off for me to take. 

Mentioned this to her, and F offered that he can stay a month every summer with them. We both were not super okay with that. F said we can honeymoon... we would just be working, we can't afford anything like that, (we are on EBT for context). We don't want him flying alone, she said she could drive or fly with him. We said we would ask S. Asked him if he woud want to stay longer than a week when we go down, he wants to think about it. 

Neither of us want him to spend time with them without us due to past behaviors and our current relationship with family members. F said that their grandmother can barely walk now, I think she is late 60s? Which, I don't know why it would be a good idea for S to be left alone with her, in case something happens, she lives 2hrs away from everyone and sort of in the country. She is also an alcoholic and has smoked in the kitchen with him there. 

I understand why they want to see him for so long. But would we be the assholes for not wanting him to stay with them. If S wants to, I don't know what to do. ",1,1771489398.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Brands, startups, and even small handmade businesses are shifting toward materials that reduce waste and environmental impact. One growing solution is [**Eco Friendly Custom Labels**](https://www.bcilabels.com/earth-friendly-labels), designed to support responsible production without compromising visual appeal or durability.

These labels are often made from recycled paper, biodegradable films, or responsibly sourced materials that minimize carbon footprint. Water-based inks and non-toxic adhesives further enhance their environmental value. Beyond materials, sustainable labeling also considers production efficiency, waste reduction, and end-of-life recyclability.

Consumers today actively support businesses that demonstrate environmental responsibility. A thoughtfully designed label can communicate transparency, ethical sourcing, and a commitment to greener practices. It’s not just about branding—it’s about aligning packaging decisions with long-term ecological goals.

From product packaging and shipping boxes to apparel tags and handmade goods, sustainable labeling options provide flexibility across industries. By adopting environmentally conscious alternatives, businesses contribute to reduced landfill waste and support circular economy principles.

I met him during the transitional break up phase of my long term relationship that I was unhappy for a long time. I felt like all my attention suddenly was focused solely on him. 

He's nice. He's handsome. He kisses me passionately and we've been cuddling most of the time for about an hour or two post sex. 

When I'm with him I'm happy. But I know there's nothing that can come out of this. He's in a long term happy open relationship. And they're about to get married in a few months. 

If I'm being honest, I feel like I caught feelings for him. Maybe due to the way he kisses me, the way he makes me feel when were together. I feel secured, loved (ofc it's not love) and seen. 

And I really really hate myself for feeling this way. I was expecting to have a ""finding of self"" phase after i broke up with my ex, BUT NO. I find myself attached to someone emotionally unavailable instead. 

It's really frustrating. I kept waiting for another message. and recently I realized it's very transactional. He mssages me only to have sex (ofc what else should he message me for)and it's very rare (one or every two weeks). We met 7 times already.

Last month was my birthday and he spent a day with me. Bringing me to a coffee shop, then to the beach, wave watching while just talking about life. He brought me to a park. Then went to his place to have sex. Then we went out to have Korean food. It was a whole 8 hour day with him.

I'm so very exhausted feeling this way. I don't want this for myself. 😩 How can I shift my mind of this? I don't want to block him. I think that's just very unfair/rude. Can you maybe teach me mind shifting/paradigm techniques?

Way back before Laguna had Ellone and even before the Time he was studying in the Academy he once had a leave into The West Coast to The New World. The flight to San Francisco would take about 18 Hours from the Old Continent and Raine was traveling with him back then in their twenties. They had arrived at the the Airport in Esthar very early at the break of the dawn having had to meet already at 4:20 AM because of a practical reason that the flight took a whole day and for an excentric reason that it had been ""A 4:20 Day"" which in this context meant apropos to historys eximia they were flying to The Frisco. They had still been Young and into the Hippie Movement so naturally they wanted to experience the whole culture around their way of life and A historical fact so it was that the Movement was an impact from the Summer of '69 at the Golden Gate Park the twentieth of April. The couple of noire both dark haired had a flight reserved which would begin boarding the passengers six o'clock.
  The airport was a colossal building from the inside having a faint sense of a breeze to it probably because it was well air conditioned, and there were plentiful of merchandise you might be able to buy from the Seven Elevens aswell as warm snacks and bread from the Hot Dog Vendors and that wasn't even close to all what it had inside. There were a few restaurants and a business class réservement for those who had the money in addition, there was a huge deal of magazines to buy from which to have some leisure for the time being while waiting the plane to begin with the boarding and there were games stores which sold console games and gameboys aswell as stores selling toys and such vendors too who would sell you A Rolex if You please. Now that Laguna and Raine had walked inside they had one and a half an hour to wait before attending to their flight so why not to grab a cup of tea Laguna had told Raine. Ofcourse she had said yes and they had walked hand in hand feeling positive to the Check In where all of the passengers needed to leave their luggage in order to have it packed inside the airplanes room, because they needed stuff like changing clothes for at least a week and there wasn't enough space for all of that inside the planes cabin. The happy faces inhibited a little bit of a romantic mood and so the chamber assistant had poured their tea wondering if they were just married having a getaway or if it might have been their honeymoon still leaving the matter aside not saying anything, but anyway it had made even the old clerck happy to see how they were beaming that day. Luckily the weather was fine in order to have a sound traveling and not a single thing worried their minds back then, because of an easy living and a nice change of milieu or even better an archipelagio if you may.
  Time passed slowly while they were leaning on the soulful company of their own sipping tea looking into the eyes of eachother and sometimes talking about funny conceptions that had happened to them while enjoying a large window that actually made up the whole wall of the aéroports providing a delightfull view. The tea was brewed with fine leaves and a qualified seed of a bit of honey tasting as good as it gets and one at the slowly crowding airport would have probably wondered what it was that such of a handsome or beautiful couple come what may have had discussed to them selves for it wasn't every day You might have spotted them. Anyway the airports were such a curious places that one could get a private feeling to his/herself without depending on the huge crowd there was all around because of the spacious feeling somehow affected the couple making everything go away. They excited themselves by talking english already even if it wasn't for that arriving into San Francisco was due to another Time Zone so, because Laguna had a sudden change of heart he had out of the blue changed to The americano which as a role model did Raine good, because She was half orphaned and secretly made her admire her boyfriend. She wasn't that awful at english even though at first it had an impact upon her having an effect like if it embarrased the lady to speak a foreign language and like that only a stranger wouldn't know how to pronounciate correctly but it had been a clever idea to act like it, because that way they would already be fluent over the language barrier in before hand by the time of arriving to the destination. The airport actually was an international aero space, because there were people from all around of the world talking many different languages the kinds of like Chinese, English and Hispanic so to say oriental, anglo-saxon and even latin language families representatives adding to the local one they were talking in Esthar which naturally was based completely upon a lasayding due to the semantical macrostructure that resembled a poem where the stanza did arise, and the lingua franca for that they shared contemporal elements meaning it was timidily living in the moment due to how it was accented, and it even did sound familiar to Taiwanese for the word étymology had an orient origin, and if one wanted to be completely accurate about the distant relatives to the language family it would have belonged into a nentsy phonétique archetype, because it so to say rounded meanings from the spatial surroundings which was typical to languages already been spoken over 3000 Years. Then there were apart from those main language family representatives who shared a flight destination in common into the Frisco, other than the ones which would have had been the most spoken languages over there aswell the few groups walking by speaking other foreign languages like Russian, which sounded a bit similar to Portuguese onomatopoeticaly and in addition to that another Afrikaans like Algerian and Syrian aswell as Japanese.
  Afterwards they had spent the time waiting they had been into a deep conversation about a biology lubenter and while they were encompassing themselves into the boarding, showing the boarding passes for the accustomer and leaving into Frisco Plane via the ramp they still had been discussing their brain and wondering if they had arrived at a right conclusion that if it was all been only for their récognition biologicaly leaving their sympathique to the side may it be just a distant memory of another space and time after such of a time period it would take all the brain cells to renew? The flight was quite exhausting in a way only to just sit there on the assigned seat but it had been for the best that they had recieved pretty good ones near the front side of the airplane. After six hours if it was true or not atleast according to an urban legend deriving back to a scientific publication all of the brain cells would have renewd in the cortex, and it's been precisely so long Raine had mysteriously told young Loire. I wonder if we're still the same two people afterwards the relating bodies of our arcane got wiser and older and the conciousnes we share might attract the focus to become selfaware of being alike to the older people whos hair had turned gray Laguna had said to Raine. Atleast if You had asked me Loire told Raine.

DG: Narration

Being silent over ten years isn't that simple because time passes sometimes faster and sometimes slower in the eye of the beholder and due to staying quiet one begins to observe the matter at hand with a visual perception and so the difference in between the primary situation and the latter solution looks like if all the precious things a man had in his room vanished leaving the room almost empthy. You have for years earned sakes of a differing kind and now the money is gone so it feels not just empthy inside, but there's the side taste, which is the one like you're dumb and like if you don't know what to do aswell as the season on thé table: For A Hermit.
  It really means having to do things alone for as long as one needs to get the work ready and done but here's the catch; and the catch is that you already have made yourself ready for that day for a lifetime being a rock solid five years in your late twenties reaching for just one goal, which included only a few persona from all of them in our/their group, which would later on still be needed. Pros and cons are that You did manage on your own so the situation is completely of ones own earning, but you haven't always been reasonable, because of the inspiration took you for granted and the money turned into personal information and now that it's gone you'll need the help of an unit in the society to keep yourself secure from being harmed after losing your private information. Losing simply leads into A radio discommunication so that you don't have to be dealing with the people who probably could use your money for their own good and because the individual happened to have turned his money into personal information now having it gone out of the window The keeping quiet about is the most rational way to compensate a collateral damage.

Laguna was once again sitting by the table in The Nautilus with a typewriter he used for writing a column in the local press, and having to look inside he was thinking about honesty and solidarité towards himself and the other person he had deep inside been afraid of because he had earned wisdom, which was more than he could have expected when it all went down around half a decade ago when the Radio Discommunication was due. Now he was happy to have a job and the truth was that he had found someone back then when he in the first place had begun making ready for the day he had played with the little Jargon having been dealt the Hermit Card so suddenly. When you have something reasonable go away from your life it affects the world of yours and in the relation with the surrounding space you're habiting one may be able to get a bigger jargon on the old ones place he finally typed. Looking into a change of life, which will have a cause for a complete society has carefully to be studied in before hand from the side of the Law Unit so it may by that time be in a common concideration and in a case which is beredied completely so that all of the previous cases about the Law are listed having anything in common. It needs to be put in order such a rational way that it'll introduce the whole matter in an intuitive and well organized way so that any Law Citation that Any Man may come to think about will be a natural way to quote The Common Law.
  If the duchuesney might for any other reason than which was lawful to be going to maintain A Radio Discommunication it would inflict an individual in a negative way, because that would affect him/her with a status ailment due to the problem provoking criminal activity in such a way that the individual could be driven towards the edge of a society, which also is a criminal enaction caused by the hate speech. As a phenomenon the radio discommunication is another relating way to go trough cencor ship and as the apropos of philosophy it was a means to be ending The Invasion of Lunatic Pandora, because it belongs to the rational age logical principe not causing a death penalty even if it was against a common enemy, hence a humanitarian way to solve a conflict doesn't include causing casualities of death.

R: Mr. Loire did this for a living on a daily basis going to work as a free lancer and a part time investigating journalist because it just belonged to his style having graduated from the Academy and having an Army Job, because he didn't know how to recruit in any other way into contribution to the society. Afterwards he packed his typewriter and left in order to walk home just stopping by a grocery store to buy the food items belonging to the season and from time to time if there was a special occasion he would go to the magazine building near the harbor where they sold pescadily like for instance tuna fish, which he thought was delicious. Back at home they would prepare a waterbank from the items on the list and consume it together and so they stayed happy and wouldn't suffer from a poisoning status ailment. Their life was pretty decent as it was and they were happy together having not to think about an optional future every night, but just focusing into cooking banks of water and keeping up with the working inspiration, because it was an important custom to his liking.

DE: A future day back in the Academy where they were teaching The SeeD Cadets, Instructor Trepe just lasaid her class dismissed and young Mr. Leonheart going due to stay after the class in order to furtherly be instructed. Eventhough his person is shy as they come having sort of a natural trauma attending to her class, because of his swiftness from the day one in the relation in between them, changing this relationship of theirs slowly from formal to a more casual kind felt for him like an alien thing becoming friends with an apriori a formal person. Maybe it became easier to stay in a converse with her being a femme, because there was no having to find a way out at the end of the day meaning he could stay with her if it was meant to be that way they both being young at age. What he didn't know was that A Christian Man had gone missing and eventhough it wasn't the topic of their discussion today it surely would have an impact to his life later on.
  One such evening their walking the aisle in Balamb Garden lead the lady instructor to urge him into the practice area so that Miss Trepe might show him a detail statistique, ended up to meeting the grown up Ellone in the hands of a white-coats bringing her away without a word. It would become a famous precase of A Law about a person acting against others identité because the both Mr. Leonheart and Miss Trepe aren't able to tell what that's all about still having a humongous impact on Their Living.

DG: Conclusion

Lagunas writing went on like a train evryday does in a metropol where the modern subways transported tons of people by the day no question about if an individual was about to commute, may it be for today he had an inspiration that made him feel right on the killswitch having a solution in his mind A OK positive. The correspondent had crossed an okies story going trough the archive in The Dollets Folk Archive telling about a senior who had died of a broken heart, which had at the first impression surmised him close to nothing having only a slightly hounted feeling and it had took him but a few years to figure out that his ration couldn't tell him stright, because of his emotion had been crystal clear. The Story about Miina who had died a single man of an old age was undebatabe in love with a female during the 1700' only if it hadn't been that she was already been married to a local farmer. It was so curious that the history had a remark about him waiting for her to become available again, which she did infact after her spouse died of a natural cause, but she had been married twice to another local farmhand leaving the protagonist awaiting forever more love. Laguna wouldn't too often back out about what he had just written so he had to trust his intuition about the subject having a relating echo with his article. Could it be some kind of a resemblance to a radio discommunication in a theoretical manner having a person spirited away like that?
  The case had a symbolical quality to it leaving the studying subject wondering if the poor fellow had suffered troughout his lifetime, but then it had occured the correspondent what if it had been a message to the modern time manchild reading in between the lines that the object of Old Miinas love had meant him to fall in love with her image like for instance a maiden they had oftenly kept in the farmhouse or possibly in a similar way to meeting the lady by having a relation to the opposing supposed during a festivity like a dancing ball or if not so then why not during a console game. It's sure been hard for all of us living in the Dollet region having the radio discommunication make channels and transmissions go away. If you asked me it wasn't really like that Laguna wrote.
  Probably Miina was still alive in some way, because it wasn't his time yet to come and the reason about his poor luck by then had been somewhat irrational still being stright edge with the fact about what Lagunas emotion had at the first impression already told him at the beginning, which was that the lady had been widowed and due to been hounted like that, his spirit come down from the heaven. It was a contradiction though because of the radio signals obviously hadn't been able to land like even the soul of the widows did. If it was a precase légitimite as it actually had a slight ringing about... Did it remind me about myself Laguna was typing?
  As if the faith took a slight of a hand the correspondent took on an iniative next which naturally was just his job and cleared as it happened to be the best case in his future work without even knowing it in before hand. He had figured out a fact which was to surmise what was about to happen to his daughter later on in her life, because he wrote that even though it had seemed like Miina became unhappy because of a woman, could it be so that she had been there for him like a heavens ward was to protect his feelings from a delirious nightmare one suffering from, which had taken place in the eyes of the village community. Yes in a way this is true was the honest opinion so he typed it down and took a swallow of Bean Best like Ellone used to say for she knew that Laguna was a bit of an addict to coffee. The precase forecast what was about to happen, which was that the white-coat has no right to take Ellone away from the members of a society, because of a trauma one such reminded about a phantom taking a local widow away from somebody who cared about her feelings. It was trivial so why not let the people attend to their lives with A right of freedom. The fact about A most common names real accurate definition according to the statistics was that it's ""OK"" meaning that you could use these initials in an honest and righteous way to call over, than a half of the members of a community as if by their baptised name without affecting the factor, that was used in calculus over in the statistique.

RS: Way before these radio discommunication mishaps took place it was a sunny day at the beach in Santa Barbara where you might spot an albatross and a seal over the silhouette of the sea horizon. It was a trouble free atmosphere over there into The Brave New World as it hopefully would later on become too in the Duché and the Academical Garden after the head of the state might take responsibility over it's denizen individual and young Mr. Leonheart and Miss Trepe be informed about what's to it A foreign military personel invading their sovereignity.
  Laguna Loire and his girlfriend Raine had been a great couple in their twenties looking good as ever going to the beach where it was a perfect tide for a hobbyist surfing practizal. They were just the two of them, because they would try and begin her to learn a bit about how it was done. He had been a natural talent and been able to catch the second wave ever the time he was trying for the first time. He had swam and spotted the sea bird and that mammal, then paddeled the water with his arms untill he was on the brink of the flowing tide, hopped upon the surfing board and knack his knee a knick of time.

PS: Raison De Ether The Radio Discommunication

Gaining perspective over The World Situation is A Simple Game alike to One They Would sell Antiquiteous. The White Queen or ""Jargon"" is A Classic that people played due to the games simplicity and imago, because it was looking fair and majestic. The Rules were quite easy... The Player would move tiles... Someone's staring at us Laguna said to himself. He had become aware of it over Twelve Years ago so it wasn't necessary to identify the surroundings twice. The correspondent had realized slowly about Six Years past A Cause which did affect as a préliminaire meaning that the things, not just may but will escalate quickly. Common sense was the entourage and under circumstances priori aswell as apriori they might fall under a status ailment.
  Laguna Loire could up-to-date percieve that one of his correspondents was affiliated with third parties. He reasoned that the mythos over logique stated the ground rule about ""The Two"" lasayding left and right. If it was such a case in which this became compromized it meant that due to an action taken by a third member of the society possibly under a dissociation a thief was following them. The knowledgeabouts were first the causing of a status ailment Confusion under which the party members started attacking each other uncontrolled until the panic faded and second the hate speech which affected an individual causally over long periods of time inflicting him/her with loneliness driving towards the edge of the society. There were but a few items the father and daughter needed from the mall. First item on the list was a beans and the second one was a sweeties. Before any encrazed enaction was about to take place Laguna and Ellone redirected towards The Coffee Place/Picadeli Nautilus so the correspondent could fix himself with the best coffee bean in the Town and the sweetheart might get herself a pretty tasty triangle bread.


As soon as they had left their apartment they turned right and walked stright forward for one quarter. The Dolletian architecture was familiar to a youngian infrastructure as well as the common european style so the quarters wouldn't take too long to walk from corner to another but just a hundred meters or so if the port corridors hadn't been intact. It would always take another hundread meters in order to reach the corner of a quarter which was the measure for a few port corridors and obviously the complexes were lots smaller than the ones to The New Continent Metropol. The Place they were going to was in another direction infact if you did wan't to get around the fastest route. Luckily this type of an architecture led people around in a manner of a classical logistic options, because you had the chance to turn right whenever it was necessary and not lose your way around the town scape. Whenever things back fired Laguna could choose their way taking a right turn and holding on to going stright forward always withdrawing from turning left. He and his daughter turned again right in the next corner and walked another hundread meters until they reached the other side of their block. From here they were able to turn to the direction where The Nautilus was and head there safe and sound staying aware of their surroundings. It didn't take too long but just a few minutes to get around to the other side of the quarters and from over there they walked another fifteen minutes until the havens side of the town where Nautilus located. The Place was across the street on the right behind a couple of small blocks. The time was past twelve o'clock in the noon when the couple of them arrived to their destination. He opened the door for her which caused the little bell sound happily a-ring-a-ling and they walked into the stone ledge joint. First they sought a table for the two of them and afterwards they were setteled they would take their valuables along to the counter where they placed the orders. Ellone did keep evry little thing valuable to her so she wouldn't even leave her coat on the seats arch, but she carried it on her shoulders. Laguna on his behalf only took the wallet aswell as the keys and left his jacket leaning on the bench.
  The deli that Nautilus had been famous over provided a boxes lot which replenished customers with an assertion of a myriad food items. Ellone only had to choose the ones she wished to have on her triangle bread so she took a careful look into the food wares. There were such a bricoleur you might have told the staff and evrything seemed satisfying. It was so hard to pick a single item that she wondered aloud what to take ending up with Laguna suggesting her tuna and sliced eggs. The daughter placed the order and soon she had picked mayonnaise from the list for the topping. Ellone looked at her triangle bread very happily after the clerck had it prepared just in a minute and took it in their table. Laguna asked for a cup of coffee. He already had a breakfast before. He also took it to the table and then they would discuss a matter about the correspondents briefing, because the daughter was under stress and being already mentioned a thief was chasing them the things would escalate under the circumstance if that staring wouldn't come to an end. Ellone asked him what it meant to escalate things?
  Laguna Loire explained carefully that they were safe where they were and there was no rush to put anything to an end, because to escalate things meant to start a series of events that would excelerate exponentially apropos to the mathematics and the physiques. It just wouldn't stay safe if somebody was staring at them from now on and even worse if it had already lasted for A cycle of twelve Years. She made a remark that after such of a period of time she would become a teenager about which Laguna corresponded nodding. Then he went on explaining about what he currently was working on using scientific facts he would use hoping this would help her relief the anxiety she was feeling about their life situation. To coexist meant that they became an item together and due to the fact they were a couple of two it was a simple problem about a philosophical nature which was called the éphistéme in which the fact was basing on the existéntialisme. A common interest they shared lay in the field of the physics as in the planets. It resembled An Aristoteles Philosophical Tradition, because during his life he had been a customs man. The daughter would interrupt him from time to time and now she wanted to know if a customs man was the one that checked their bags in an aeroport?
  Laguna went on explaining her carefully that their coexistence was a dear matter to him and it was so, because he thought it became meaningful for a man to become a father. He may have understood that Ellone was using her rethoric instead of her curiosity argumenting over an airport security, because it was actually from a song that Arlo Guthrie sang, which was called ""Coming into Los Angeles"" they had been listening to the day before. The father sipped the coffee feeling much better already looking out on the street from the window. He didn't think anyone was following them stalkative. He smiled at his daughter who was enjoying her funny shaped bread. Time passed further on giving them a little release while some other customers entered the Restaurant with a ringing of the door bell. Enjoying their time together and chatting with her made him want a refill cup to savour their moment together. He took it back to their table and then told he had figured out an example to set the matter stright adding soon up that nothing will last forever if it wasn't for the qualité of the refillemente.
  He was explicating matters in his mind so the proper explication which he tought will probably do was The Planet Venus, because if you might differentiate matters from each other then you could substitute the constituents of the differing qualities of them with the folk of the Solar Systems Planets in order to pick just one of them to adapt the matter in such a way, that it resembled the lasayding attached to the matter at hand. Meaning they had to stay put for half a Year at a Time keeping out of trouble, because that was the precise Period of Time the Planet Venus circled around twice a Year. Her father remarked that six months summa six months summa summarum one year. Then the planet Venus appeared in the Sky. It was a personal planet because of it's lore that adapted being close to the biological nature attaining Planet Earth, it would normatize the little lasting natural cycles that followed the biorythm the Earth had being The Day and Night and meaning The Sun and The Moon were common in our stratosphere. The reason nothing lasts forever was the six month biorythm followed a six month sleeprythm and that was, because first the Venus appeared on the morning sky in the beginning of May and soon as it disappeared slowly it reappeared in the night sky in the tide of October and November. It also was a philosophical apropos to call this physical phenomena The Semantics, which meant in the end the change of mind put things to a terminus for the resonance in between the day and night had a different scheme of A Mind. This was written even in The Holy Bible he prompt his daughter, but thats an understatement if You ask me Laguna said to Ellone.
  Teehee she prompted to her correspondent laughing, by this time she had finished her triangle bread and was looking at him with her eyes bright, because the deli food had been best in Town. He was wondering what he had meant to say with all the facts and if she already had taken the gnosis in with the angle of the triangle she had been consuming with care. Finally Laguna spoke again saying that You might learn a thing or two you know if you would withdraw Your opinion about having moral right about what happens to Yourself just because it's all been according to The Story. Just like the Venus switches it's position coming from the upper level of the sky ascending to the lower morning sky or later on ascend the lower evening skies You may aswell have lasayding instead about A Meta Narration. In my opinion You really should concider twice, because the higher level of the sky where It may hide from our oculaires is called An Ether.

INTRO: The Epicnáras Philosophy

The Duchuesney of Dollet prospered and prevailed time past gunpowder for the ages and the lots inhabiting the town gathered on the marketplace and strolled past the Via Fontaine Square crowding on the stone paved streets and wherever they urged on their personal daily habituaries aswell as accomodations shopping for groceries and taking their children to kindergarden. People were klinging into The Nautilus around midday to have a lunch brake and others who had free from work stayed in the Pub hitting Triple Triad Cards on the old tables and speaking french whenever the Lady Fortune faded and suddenly she would reappear. There were some who attended to their jobs working from home and such folk too who had free time in order to rest to attain their residue for the standard of living. All those people had one thing in common which was a peculiar book in all of their shelves at their properties written by the locality who became a famous female philosopher post conflict called The Epicnáras. Her character was actually resemblance to DeBeauvoir who had an impact in the real world historically, a figurine echoing in the Time Continum from the tradition leading back into the classic age. DeBeauvoir had been an item with Jean Paul Sartré who was another famed philosopher back in the Old Continent writing over the estéthic value and structuralism meaning his character was one of a social archetype and a well known author in the french existentialism philosophy field of the scientific school of libertine art forms. The Epicnáras may well be an incarnation of an older philosophical entity in the Classic alike to The Agnostics who would search for a recognitional justification to withdraw from answers they recieved given expérimental or The Hedonists who would withdraw from actions which were beredied for them in detailed correspondences in order not to affect a causalité. Another point of view is that DeBeauvoir may frankly be an acronym she was using or possibly be her reincarnation and still the supposition reminds us from the reneissance and especially the Rationalist Age because of the Philosophical tradition gives birth to timeless thinkers who are first introduced to the world already before our reminiscence.
  The Epicnáras lasaid world element correct as an argument which was most well known of all statements her Philosophy provided and it was held the most accurate post conflict philosophy, because one could percieve precisely the same matter with ones own eyes what her idealism suggested, still leaving further fields of philosophical debate open to other conciderations. During the first years time period post conflict she constituted a critique which she aswell published soon just a few years after the conflict was over and being so it was the first theory to propose a convulsion that an individual was free to internalize positivistic objects of philosophy for example to chop down a lumber in order to accuire an experience point, which as an evolution philosophy was of a sceptical nature rather than a reason of a naturalistic philosophy. Or at least so the theory of hers was criticized at first, because of her views, but actually the critics proposed a hermeneutical hypothesis which was so much alike to her model it was the test of time that left Epicnáras standing instead of compromising her and, because she was of a historical value being the first one to publish after the military invasion it was her work which was commonly held of importance. Aswell the estéthique about the proposition to take an answer over experience made it possible for the charlatans and it aswell would encompass the decadence showing light for a new generation who were finally able to fade away from the individual so life would go on. Her second work did conquer the field of evolution philosophy criticism for her leading argument which remodeled the lumber as an object of the positivistic view of the world in the relation of a man taking it in like it at first was observed as if An Experimential Sceptic, but which actually was relating to a naturalistic problema which just hadn't before this been aproposiced meaning her angle to interact the problems was good, but it was peculiar so there hadn't been no questioning before this. Her groundbraking results led her to reshape the norm attached to the philosophical speech having the role over what she had said change the basis from what it had before been taken given naturally about what words she had used. For instance in the ratio of a druidism it had been natural to live by the forest and walk in the lot of the trees, but from now on due to her thinking the matter had been leveled completely the other way around having the wood come to the folk of men and getting around our world. Epicnáras most definitely had become one of the greatest Estéthiques of Our Time and thanks to her there was The Anew Applicable Instrumental Evolution Critique Of Philosophy.

The Winter is over and April's half past while the Sun's been shining warmer and the surroundings slowly are starting to grow again all of the plants looking up to the sky tuning into ever longer lasting days back here in The Duchuesney. It's been my second Year to this Post since I had another comission moving into Town and I can't help but wonder if we're staying for more than over A Five Years Period of Time, because I'm starting to think that I like it here better. I am going to introduce myself for being new in town where I'm holding on to An Old Post which has belonged to a long line of veterans before my arriving here for a reason that I think I might know this Place and even some of You better than the most of You know me by now.
  I was just 18 years old when I first decided to write about philosophy and I remember thinking over a nostalgia which may be a relating feeling to the déjà-vu I was keeping to myself while I cherished the life experience about turning of An Age in my room because that's the legaly mature age back to The Old Continent. I was finaly to myself after the discrete ceremony enjoying the time alone and I remembered it was important to decide what was that I wanted to do now it being up for Today and so I had my biggest inspiration over the Ideia of Éphistéme which turned out to have lasaid the supposing things instead of the knowing them. In my own opinion that was naïve so I intuitively criticized the idea leading to a style I later on would use for writing, because my parents had so strong ethics that they urged on me and because of that I was at first a bit rusty and for Years I didn't get on with the pen and paper even if it was for computer typing. I was lucky to go to A High School by the time and there I managed to have solved it by going into a nearby store buying the ""Tibetain Book Of The Dead"" from where I could practice the ""Kiho Tumo"" A Technique leading to have my body temperature lower a degree so that I always had a chill comparing to the people around me, which finaly lead me into the beginning of the writing process about experiences. Me being able to start up drawing sentences with my interface was it the tastature or the pen and paper it actually was due to that, what made me level down to where I had the rusty occurence, because that way I wasn't too elevated to get hold of myself. I remember having my three guitars with me in my room, which I was studying in the high school by the time I had decided about the topic and making music introduced me how to lyricize whatever crossed my mind by then. After the time 18 years later I turned 18 Years old being the Time I am 36 Years old I'm able to craft things that associate with the resource at hand and not just identify lingual objects, because I have both the instruments and the practique. It makes me wonder if the rythm in the musical art form has made me a structuralist, because it is very clear to me that the ability to express myself is all an answer to the three guitars I had that day I entered my room being a grown up man. I also owe a thanks to Epicnáras for making me use the machine lasayding to organize my subtle motoric cordination between the brain and the fingers of my hands with the laptop I had for studying later on in The Academy so that I might push the corresponding tastes which would form the exact words I had in my mind instead of trying to find a synonymous to cross-over around of expressing the sentence at hand. It was mine in a citations-mark the biggest sin trying to manage a suggestive rethoric that mannered me to internalize a matter of a fact and I would now externalize it instead of writing something that was in a way always a little different than it was meant to be in my own mind.
  We here in the duchy are staying for as many years as it takes to prepare for the way the drum dowes. I don't personaly believe in things or wait anything to happen for the just because. I like to think positive and organize matters so that evrything happens according to the great plan, because it won't ever happen twice and according to the life management it would be foolish to use too many tryouts in order just to perform A Thang.

1r8tgj3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r8tgj3,Another build,"Here’s another build I recently did for a friend! 

A quite large coffee table made from solid beech. 

The top was 3 boards glued and doweled together. Then sanded smooth and then edge profiled ran through my table saw at a long angle (sketchy but felt safe), then the sharp corners just taken off with a small hand plane.

The legs were then made and joined to the runners with dowels and glue, and the runners are joined with a cross lap joint I think it’s called. I wish I spent the time to do some nice joinery to join the legs to the runners :/. All the burn marks were sanded out don’t worry! 

Then attached the bottom base to the top using threaded inserts in the top and through holes in the base so that it could be assembled and disassembled if needed with ease.

Finished with a clear polyurethane finish to keep the woods light colour but a strong coat with popping grain.

I can’t figure it out.,"My older brother is a lazy jerk who quit his job to make statues to sell. His wife couldn’t afford it, so they moved in to my parents’ home. Where I live in the basement. 

Although i begged my Mother, she allowed it anyway. You see, when he was 12, he and four friends object raped me for 54 days. I will never drink out of a longneck bottle. But I knew if he moved in my past trauma which had been shoved down would surface. 

I knew i would be hurt. I just did not realize how badly. 

He started screaming right in my face overstupid stuff. Usually? He thought I touched his stuff. He called me terrible names and said if I would just kill myself the family would have no more problems. 

I never knew when he’d be set off, i never knew why. He’d just go off on me suddenly. 

I don’t want to hear how it’s not really about me. Yeah, it is. Even if it’s his guilt manifesting over hurting a little girl, it’s still me. He would trap me so i could not escape. I can’t be in a room without an escape. He didn’t scream at my dad, didnt scream in my mothers face. 

He turned off my cell phone and home internet intermittently. 

He broke my things. He threw my laundry in the floor if he wanted the machines. My mothers cat pees on any clothing that hits the floor. I love cats. I hate hers. 

My parents literally sit by and watch him scream at me. My dad usually said that he was the one moving the coffee mug. My mother sat in her chair and ignored it all. His wife just looked on. 

Nobody told him it was inappropriate. Nobody said, you cant scream like that. 

He is asking for a video inventory because he’s accusing me of selling his inheritance on eBay. I just can’t even with that. 

I did not spend my time thinking if ways to hurt him and bug him. His wife said i must. She said i overreacted about my childhood abuse. 

I soon could not separate old from new. I saw that bottle in his hand. 

I begged my father to ask them to leave; he told me id be asked to leave, too. I need my safety and i was threatened with homelessness. 

He complained I was negative and just always was bitching. I was sobbing for help. 

I begged for help, i am getting the runaround. Section 8 said Im in a better place than what they can offer. 

My house is literally making me sick. I have an autoimmune disease and so my immune system is suppressed. I basically have no defense. 

I found black mold rampant in my bathroom and told my father. 

He ignored me. 

I posted on Facebook, can anyone tell me what this is? How do i get rid of it. 

Within 3 hours my dad and little bro had ripped out the door to the shower, leaving it open. Shower curtain time! 

Then they ripped out my vanity leaving me with no water. 

Then they ripped out a wall between the bathroom and the furnace room. 

I have no privacy. 

Big bro had been in that room when I got out if shower. 

Breathing in co2 because of furnace. 

They did not fix the leak causing the mold. 

They did not even rip out all the damage. 

That was 5 years ago and now I have mushrooms. I have no where to go. 

They have me trapped. 

My father got really sick and had to have a triple bypass.,

My mother hurt her back and cant move. 

I am now doing the chores if 3 ppl. Nobody cares. I clean up after everyone. Always have. 

My parents get new responsibilities and I am forced to take them on. Christmas was a nightmare. Mom wanted more and more decorating done.  She decided two days before she wanted just about everything on the gold child’s list to be under the tree come christmas morning. Him and his 5 kids. Adult children who understand money is tight. 

I freaking produced a miracle, including 6 pairs of matching pajamas. 

I asked to leave the tree for my grandson, they complained and i 

Insulin? Sure! 

Medicaid? Absolutely! 

Va benefits? Of course! 

The last day older brother lived there, Dad was in the icu. I was taking mom back and forth, hitting the wall every day. 

My moms cat sticks her nail in the slider opens it to come downstairs to go to the bathroom. Since they were camping- even though they have allergies so bad they can’t rake one leaf, trim one bush, mow. I decided to lock the door, just not wanting her in my stuff. 

I came home about 9 pm. My battery does not charge like other people. Drains faster, too.  Exterior wide open. The slider is on its side, the locks ripped out if the wall stud. The frame is still missing. I suspect he threw it out. 

Dog missing. 

12 yo white lab sweetest dog was out in the wind. 

Bro said he wanted to do his laundry a day earlier. I had to fix the frame and was told i was annoying. 

But decided my locking my door to protect my belongings was the end of his rope. 

He threw everything. My clothes were pulled and tossed. My Bible collection on the floor. My dolls across from where they started. He just lost his mind because i shut a door. 

I was just so sick i couldn’t even call the cops.

1r8tetj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infinitesights/comments/1r8tetj/aileen_wisell_coastalinspired_brand_design_in/,Aileen Wisell: Coastal-Inspired Brand Design in Boston,"Read the original article and support Infinite Sights at [https://infinitesights.com/aileen-wisell/](https://infinitesights.com/aileen-wisell/)

*Aileen Wisell is a Boston based graphic designer with roots in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. She creates brand identities, websites, and visual systems for clients across lifestyle, wellness, and creative industries.*

# A scene from the water

On an early summer morning at Kettle Cove, the light settles in soft bands across the rocks. Kayakers move quietly along the shore. One of them is Aileen Wisell, a Boston designer who still returns to these waters for clarity. She keeps a small sketchbook tucked in her dry bag. When the tide is low, she paddles to a flat rock, sits down, and begins drawing color notes. “This is where ideas start for me,” she says. “The coast has always been part of how I see color.”

This pull toward place is the thread that runs through her work. It shows up in the calm layouts she builds for wellness brands. It shapes the natural palettes she creates for interior designers. It even guides the way she works with clients. At the center of it all is a theme that has shaped her life: finding creativity in everyday moments.

# How early details shaped her craft

Aileen’s path began long before she opened her studio. She grew up between Lexington, Portland, and Cape Elizabeth. Her father, a structural engineer, taught her how to look closely at form. Her mother, a teacher at Pond Cove School, taught her how to explain ideas simply. At home, her brothers Tom and Nathan filled the house with music and coding projects, giving her an early mix of art and logic.

In high school, she designed playbills and yearbook layouts. Her digital poster Drift won first place in the Maine Scholastic Art Awards in 2009. The project stood out for its simplicity and clear storytelling. “I liked that design could say something without shouting,” she recalls.

# Design as clarity

This idea followed her to MassArt. While studying graphic design, she focused on identity systems and the way visuals guide behavior. Her senior thesis explored branding for independent travel companies. She learned to build visual cues that help people move through content with confidence. “Good design isn’t decoration,” she says. “It’s a tool that makes choices easier.”

She later interned at Tank Design in Cambridge, where she created social media templates for Stonyfield Organic. These small but tight deadlines taught her precision. At Hatch Design Group, she refined that skill while building materials for Boston restaurants. From there, she moved to North Loop Creative, taking the lead on brand identity projects across wellness and education.

# The shift to independence

In 2020, she launched Wisell Creative. The move gave her more control over her process and allowed her to work closely with clients who value thoughtful design. Today, she collaborates with organizations like Seagrass and Stone in Kennebunkport, Kind Harbor Wellness in Newburyport, and Camber Coffee Co. in Boston.

Her projects usually start with a pencil sketch and a walk along the water. She builds moodboards filled with Maine landscapes, Scandinavian lines, and vintage coastal signage. She uses her own photos of Acadia and Portland Head Light to shape colors. “Nature does the hard part,” she says. “I just pay attention.”

# Small habits that make the work stronger

Aileen’s creative process is grounded in simple routines. She keeps a rooftop herb garden in the South End. She journals every morning in a bullet notebook. She revisits her old sketchbooks to track how her style changes over time. She volunteers with InnerCity Weightlifting, helping people build visual identities for new businesses. “Design should give people a path forward,” she says. “Even small brands deserve clarity.”

These habits reflect her belief that creativity isn’t a flash. It’s a practice built in minutes, not leaps. Research in creativity backs this up. Studies from Stanford and the American Psychological Association show that steady, low pressure creative tasks are more sustainable than long, high pressure sprints. Her own routine mirrors this idea, turning design into a rhythm rather than a race.

# Why her story connects

Aileen’s work blends city energy with the calm of the coast, giving her clients a style that feels both modern and grounded. Her designs highlight the idea that clarity can be beautiful and that good storytelling starts with listening. This theme is woven through every part of her career. From early school projects to nonprofit collaborations, she returns to the same core lesson: the small details shape the whole.

# What comes next

She continues to build Wisell Creative one client at a time, focusing on brands that want visual systems with purpose. She hopes to expand her mentorship work and explore projects connected to community storytelling.

For now, she still starts most days with a simple routine. A sketch, a cup of coffee, and a memory from the coast. That is where her clarity begins.

# Interview with Aileen Wisell

# You often talk about finding creativity in small moments. Where did that mindset begin for you?

It goes back to growing up in Maine. My family spent a lot of time near the water, and I learned early on that inspiration doesn’t have to be dramatic. Some of my first design ideas came from watching how light changed on the rocks at Kettle Cove or how colors shifted after a storm. Those details stayed with me. Later, when I started studying design, I realized that small moments give you the clearest ideas because they’re honest. You’re not trying to force creativity, you’re just paying attention.

# What was a turning point in your development as a designer?

High school was a big shift. Designing the playbill for Guys and Dolls in 2009 was the first time I saw my work printed and handed out to a whole audience. Then winning first place in the Maine Scholastic Art Awards for my poster Drift gave me confidence that design was something I could pursue, not just something I liked doing. MassArt pushed me further. My thesis on travel brand identities taught me how to build systems instead of one off pieces. That project showed me how storytelling works across many formats.

# How did your early jobs shape your approach to branding?

At Hatch Design Group, I worked on collateral for restaurants like The Buttery and Neptune Oyster. Restaurant work forces you to think about how design looks in motion. Menus get folded, signs sit in bright light, logos show up in tiny social profile circles. Those constraints taught me to simplify. At North Loop Creative, I moved into full brand systems. Clients in wellness and education need designs that feel calm and trustworthy, so I learned how to use space, color, and typography to guide people without overwhelming them.

# What does your creative process look like today?

It always starts analog. I sketch by hand before touching a computer. I keep moodboards built from Maine landscapes, Scandinavian shapes, and old maritime signs. I walk around Boston with my camera and collect textures or colors that feel useful. When I’m stuck, I go outside. Kayaking on Sebago Lake or paddleboarding at Kettle Cove resets my mind. I also keep a bullet journal where I track color palettes and lettering practice. These little habits keep me grounded and help projects move without forcing ideas.

# You do a lot of work with nonprofits and community groups. What draws you to that?

I like projects that give people a clearer voice. When I volunteer with InnerCity Weightlifting, I help people build branding for their new businesses. Many of them are starting fresh after hard experiences. Good design gives them a sense of legitimacy. It makes their work feel real to the world. I believe that design shouldn’t only serve big companies. It should help people tell their story in a way that feels true to them.

# What advice would you give to someone trying to grow as a designer?

Pay attention to your environment. Almost everything I do today ties back to places I spent time in as a kid or as a student. Your style comes from your experiences, not from trying to copy what’s trending. Also, build small routines. Keep a sketchbook, take photos, or spend ten minutes a day exploring something visual. And don’t overlook accessibility. Clear, readable design will always outlast complicated layouts. Most of all, stay curious. Good design is built from questions, not answers.",1,1771488150.0,infinitesights,0,1.0,False
1r8tep8,https://chat.whatsapp.com/GRMlRHXsfjN6RXCqHpWI4C?mode=gi_t,"Kaiwara Betta Sunrise Trek: Cave Temples, Surrounding Peaks, and Morning Views! ⛰️🌅","Hey folks! Just wrapped up an incredible sunrise trek to Kaiwara Betta this past weekend. I organized and led a group of 21 people, and despite the size, the logistics actually played out super smoothly. If you're looking for a quick escape that mixes a solid physical challenge with some seriously high-vibration spiritual energy, this is it.

Here is my detailed A-Z guide for anyone planning to go.

📊 Quick Stats

 \* Distance from Bangalore: \~65-70 km

 \* Trek Distance: 4-5 km round trip

 \* Duration: 2 to 3 hours total

 \* Difficulty: Easy

 \* Permits: You must book forest permits  which costs ₹300 in advance via https://aranyavihaara.karnataka.gov.in/

🥾 **The Sunrise Trail Experience**

Managing a group of 21 meant sticking to a tight schedule to beat the sun. We drove through the night to ensure we were at the base by 5:30 AM, the Gates open at 05:45 AM, Show your Ticket and ID and can start ur trek.

 \* The Ascent: The trail starts off fairly gentle but quickly turns into a series of rocky steps and boulders. Trekking in the dark under a starlit sky with headlamps is an unmatched vibe.

 \* The Summit: We hit the peak right around 6:30 AM, just as the sky was turning gold and orange. The 360-degree panoramic view of the surrounding Devarayana Durga range and rolling clouds is spectacular. Highly recommend finding a quiet rock away from the crowd to soak in the sunrise.

🗺️** Make it a Full-Day Itinerary (Nearby Spots**)

Kaiwara Betta is steeped in mythology (legends say it's where Bheema defeated the demon Bakasura) and is deeply connected to the revered saint Sri Yogi Kaiwara Narayana Taatha. You can easily turn this morning trek into a full-day exploration. Once you finish the main trek, check out:

 \* At the Base: Visit the Tatayya Cave where Narasimha Swamy Temple right after the parking point to ground yourself after the descent.

 \* Neighboring Hills: You can extend your hike by covering the nearby Bheema Bakasura Hill and Rama Seeta Hill.

 \* Tatayya Temple: Just a quick 3-4 km drive from the base.

 \* Kailasagiri Rock Temple: Only 7 km away, this incredible cave temple carved into the rock face is an absolute must-visit to wrap up the trip.

🍛 **Post-Trek Grub (A Quick Warning)**

You will burn a lot of calories, but a heads-up: there are no decent restaurants around the immediate Kaiwara area. Don't waste time hunting for local spots near the base. Your best bet for a solid, hot vegetarian breakfast after the trek is to head straight back to the highway. There are plenty of highway restaurants on the route back to Bangalore where you can finally grab that well-deserved Thatte Idli, Dosa, and filter coffee.

🎒 **Pro-Tips for a Smooth Trip**

 \* Hydration: Carry at least 2 liters of water per person. There are no water sources on the trail.

 \* Footwear: The rocky patches can get slippery, even when dry. Good grip shoes are non-negotiable.

 \* Flashlights: If you're doing the sunrise trek, a headlamp or a good torch is essential for the first hour.

 \* Leave No Trace: Please carry all your trash, including snack wrappers and plastic bottles, back down with you. Keep the trail clean!

Let me know if you guys have any questions about the route, parking! Happy trekking! 🥾

I posted about the installation (took me longer than I thought. I shared my feedback on the manual with Shades of Coffee, which provides a very comprehensive manual and great service, however I got confused at a couple of points and had to re-do bits). 

However, I have been surprised by the difference it has made. The coffee is noticeably better. I have a couple of medium roast (medium dark) on the go at the moment and the taste is much better and more consistent. It is now better than anything I could get in the fancy London coffee shops. They might have all the Marzocco and fancy grinders but they often are rushing, or your coffee sits there getting cold.

Weirdly the steam is also better (I can't quite explain that one... It seems less choppy), so my milk is also smoother. I always had enough steam but it used to be more 'explosive' at times, but now it seems to be more consistent.

I did think I might have been wasting my time and money making this upgrade but it really has changed my coffee.

Seems that the Gaggia is probably great for Italian coffee (which often has some Robusta and Is dark roast), but when you get into medium roast territory the temp issues show. While the brass boiler must have helped already, the PID has really made quite a bit of a difference. I am sure the Gaggimate would have opened up all sorts of other things...

1r8tbtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pretoria/comments/1r8tbtn/exploring_the_best_cannabis_clubs_in_pretoria/,Exploring the best Cannabis Clubs in Pretoria - what’s your go-to spot?,"I’ve been a Pretoria resident for most of my life, and it’s been wild to see how much the local cannabis scene has grown since the law changed. It feels like a new ""private social club"" pops up every other week, but finding the ones actually worth the membership can be a bit of a mission.

If you’re looking for a spot but don’t want to waste your time (or cash), here’s the lowdown on the big ones:

* **Nordic Bloom (Faerie Glen):** This is the one for people who just want a professional, ""dispensary-style"" experience. It’s super clean, industrial-chic, and has a massive variety (like 20+ strains). It’s not a lounge where you sit and smoke, but for grabbing top-quality flower or pre-rolls in the East, it’s arguably the most consistent. Very fair prices.



* **The Jazzfarm Social Club:** These guys are basically the OGs of the South African cannabis movement (linked to Fields of Green). The cool thing here is the community aspect. It’s more than just a place to get cannabis; they host private events for members. You can even handle your contributions and claims online, which is a lifesaver if you’re busy. To join, you have to be recommended by another member. PM me if you are thinking about joining.



* **420 Twig on Rubenstein (Moreleta Park):** If you actually want a place to hang out with mates, this is the one. It’s got a proper lounge vibe with pool tables, table tennis, and indoor/outdoor seating. It’s definitely more social and can get a bit loud at night, but they have a huge selection of flowers on display in jars so you can actually see/smell what you’re getting.



* **Merry Jane - Faerie Glen:** Has a real ""coffee shop"" vibe to it. And they do make a good cup of coffee, I have to be honest. You can even get a coffee with CBD and THC added. Joining the club is super easy; you need your ID and phone number. No membership fee. The staff is super friendly, and I always have a lekker chat with the tannie behind the counter. They normally have about 10 strains to choose from, Indoor and Greenhouse. Their prices are very steep. R150 per gram for greenhouse-grown cannabis is daylight robbery if you are cheap like me.

I personally think these clubs are a massive step up from the ""backroom"" vibes we used to deal with. A friend and I were actually talking about how nerve-racking it could be to buy weed back in the day. Meeting a guy on a street corner in Sunnyside, yuck. It feels much safer, and the quality control is light-years ahead of what it used to be. Plus, supporting the local brands that are actually doing things legally (well, within the private club model) is a win for the community.

I'll be visiting more Pretoria cannabis clubs in the coming weeks and sharing my experience. If you have any suggestions, or if you are a club owner or operator, I'd love to hear from you.",4,1771487862.0,Pretoria,0,0.83,False

If I try to write everything that has happened the past months, the breaking dawn wouldn't be enough to finish writing. Still, I rather write about what I'm thinking right now.

Similar to what I've told my therapist, I haven't had desires of dying or killing myself. Doesn't mean everything has been 100% good, and rose color in all this time, but at least I can manage the emotion that usually takes me to that mental state.

I don't think about dying lately, but I do think about those times I decided to do it and yet couldn't. I think about the experiences I could have missed if I were gone: I fell in love with myself again, I found peace in the people that love me, I'm thankful for each of my friends and family that cares about me, I respect myself more now, I got to see my best friend present the most beautiful thesis and saw her graduate, I see my mom retaking her goals and purposes, I see my love grow and compose music when we're home, I enjoy very ""mundane"" moments, I went dancing for the first time and had a blast, I see my cat grow old, and even though I know he'll no longer be with me one day, I'm gonna be alright, for I have cared and  loved him as much as he deserves, and that's enough. I managed to put limits to my father so he doesn't hurt me as he has done before.

I see a future now, one I haven't visualized since I was a kid. I have goals I want to achieve. I want to keep living, I want to see what other experiences there are, what people I'm gonna meet, where and with who I'll go.

I'm at peace with my own thoughts. 

And when anxiety comes back again, I'll be alright, for I know I'm not alone. They won't judge me. They love me and they'll hug me. ""Everything is gonna be alright"". I believe that now.

1r8t68s,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1r8t68s/how_to_make_people_actually_like_you/,# How to Make People Actually Like You: Psychological Tricks Backed by Science,"honestly spent way too much time reading about this. started noticing how some people just naturally have this magnetic thing going on while others (me included) were basically invisible in social situations. turns out there's actual science behind why certain people are instantly likeable and it's not just about being hot or funny.

dug through research, books, podcasts with actual psychologists (not those cringe alpha male coaches), and honestly? most of what we think makes people like us is completely backwards.

the truth is our brains are wired with these ancient survival mechanisms that make us drawn to specific behaviors and turned off by others. it's not manipulation, it's just understanding how human connection actually works. once you get it, social interactions become way less stressful.

**the mirroring effect but make it subtle**

this one blew my mind when i first read about it in ""[The Like Switch](https://a.co/d/0dzIJc4I)"" by Jack Schafer (ex FBI agent who literally recruited spies by making them like him). mirroring someone's body language, speech patterns, even breathing rhythm creates subconscious rapport. your brain interprets similarity as safety and trustworthiness.

BUT here's the thing everyone gets wrong: if you mirror too obviously or too quickly, it feels fake and creepy. the key is subtle delay. they cross their legs, you wait 20-30 seconds then adjust your posture. they use a specific phrase, you naturally incorporate it later in conversation. your mirror neurons are literally designed for this, you just gotta let them do their thing without forcing it.

**ask for small favors, not just offer help**

ben franklin effect. sounds counterintuitive but asking someone for a small favor actually makes them like you MORE. when someone does you a favor, their brain rationalizes ""i must like this person since i helped them."" it's cognitive dissonance working in your favor.

the trick is keeping it small and genuine. ""hey could you recommend a good coffee place around here?"" or ""do you have a pen i could borrow?"" creates this tiny investment in you. then thank them genuinely and remember their recommendation. humans are wired to justify their actions, so they'll convince themselves you're worth helping.

learned this from Robert Cialdini's work on influence and persuasion. insanely good research on how reciprocity actually functions in social dynamics.

**the name thing but deeper**

yeah everyone knows ""say their name"" but most people do it wrong. Dale Carnegie's ""[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://a.co/d/05eOqSJy)"" is still relevant 85 years later because this stuff is hardwired. hearing your own name activates the brain's reward centers, it's literally neurologically pleasurable.

but don't just parrot their name randomly like some sales robot. use it naturally when greeting them, when asking them a question, or when making a point that relates to them specifically. ""sarah, what do you think about this?"" feels way different than just ""what do you think?""

also remember details they share and bring them up later. ""how did that presentation go?"" when they mentioned it last week. your brain interprets someone remembering details about you as care and attention. we're all secretly obsessed with ourselves, someone who pays attention to OUR life feels like they get us.

**the power of strategic vulnerability**

this one changed my whole approach. we think being perfect and put together makes people like us. completely wrong. Brené Brown's research on vulnerability shows that selective openness creates deeper connection than projection of perfection.

share something slightly vulnerable or self deprecating early on (but not trauma dumping, that's different). ""i'm honestly terrible at cooking, burned pasta last night"" or ""i get weirdly nervous before these meetings."" it signals authenticity and gives them permission to be human too.

want to go deeper on these social psychology principles but don't know where to start? [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI-powered personalized learning app that pulls from books like the ones mentioned here, psychology research, and expert interviews to create custom audio content. You type in your goal, like 'i want to be more likeable as someone who's naturally introverted', and it builds you an adaptive learning plan with podcasts you can listen to during your commute.

What makes it actually useful is you can adjust the depth, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context when something really clicks. Plus you can pick different voices, including this smoky, engaging one that makes the content way more listenable than typical audiobooks. Makes it easier to stay consistent with learning this stuff without it feeling like homework.

**active listening like you actually mean it**

most people are just waiting for their turn to talk. your brain can tell when someone's genuinely listening vs planning their response. actual active listening means: maintaining eye contact (not staring, just present), asking follow up questions that show you processed what they said, and not immediately relating everything back to yourself.

when they finish talking, pause for half a second before responding. shows you're actually thinking about what they said vs just reacting. then ask something like ""what made you feel that way?"" or ""how did that turn out?""

Dr. Mark Goulston's ""Just Listen"" breaks down the neuroscience of why people are drawn to good listeners. when someone feels heard, their brain releases oxytocin, the bonding hormone. you're literally making them feel good on a chemical level.

**the validation technique without being fake**

find something genuinely impressive or interesting about them and acknowledge it specifically. not generic compliments like ""cool shirt"" but ""the way you explained that was really clear, made it way easier to understand.""

specificity signals genuine attention. their brain knows you actually paid attention vs throwing out random flattery. acknowledge effort, choices, skills, not just appearance or things they can't control.

this ties into Carol Dweck's research on growth mindset. complimenting someone's process or choices rather than fixed traits makes them feel seen for who they are, not just how they appear.

**the power of positive association**

your brain associates people with the emotions you feel around them. this is why dinner dates work, food creates positive feelings that get linked to the person. or why sharing novel experiences bonds people faster than routine hangouts.

be the person who brings good news, interesting ideas, solutions instead of just complaints. not toxic positivity, but generally leaving people feeling slightly better than before they talked to you. it's pavlovian conditioning but for social bonds.

**strategic disagreement builds respect**

agreeing with everything makes you forgettable. thoughtful disagreement (when done right) actually builds respect and interest. the key is disagreeing with IDEAS while validating the PERSON.

""that's an interesting take, i see it slightly differently because..."" vs ""no you're wrong."" you're showing you have your own thoughts (attractive) while still respecting theirs (essential).

Adam Grant talks about this in his work on organizational psychology. people trust and like those who occasionally challenge them more than yes-men, because it signals authenticity and confidence.

look, none of this is about manipulation or being fake. it's understanding that humans are social creatures with predictable patterns. we're all just trying to connect and feel understood. these principles work because they align with how our brains are actually wired for connection.

the people who seem naturally likeable aren't magical, they're just (often unconsciously) doing these things. now you can do them consciously until they become natural too.",1,1771487292.0,MindsetConqueror,0,1.0,False

I make coffee by myself and I prefer it black, no sugar. At this point it’s not even about taste, it’s about that clean and strong kick. People always ask how I drink it without sugar, but now I can’t imagine adding anything to it. It just hits better this way.

 For me, black coffee is supposed to be strong, bold, a little bitter  that’s the whole point. When someone adds sugar to *black* coffee, my brain gets confused too. Like if you’re adding sugar, why not just add milk and go full coffee mode? 😂

Chapter 1 

Evangeline Flynn and Lorenzo Craig had been secretly married for six years. Tonight, for the first time, he lifted their daughter, Winona Craig, high in the air. 

Five-year-old Winona laughed out loud, waving at Evangeline. “Mommy, Mr. Craig made me fly!” 

Evangeline forced a smile, her heart aching as she watched them. 

Lorenzo was drunk tonight. He probably had no idea what he was doing. 

He didn’t love Winona, and he didn’t love Evangeline either. 

He looked so happy simply because the woman he truly loved, Monica Duvall, had come back. 

Six years ago, Lorenzo and Monica were madly in love. Then Monica suddenly left. While chasing after her Lorenzo got into an accident and was paralyzed. 

Evangeline, who worked as his personal assistant, stayed by his side day and night. She put up with his bad temper, encouraged him, and helped him through his rehab. 

The day he finally stood up again, he drank too much in excitement. Mistaking her for Monica, he had Evangeline again and again that night. 

Evangeline got pregnant, and he proposed. 

But later she found out that Lorenzo didn’t love her, and he didn’t marry her out of responsibility either. 

He only married her in a surge of anger and heartbreak after seeing

After the marriage, he was practically invisible, never involving himself in her life or their daughter’s. 

On the day Winona was born, he purposely left on a business trip. 

When Winona was learning to talk, he frowned and forbade her from calling him “Daddy.” 

When Winona’s skateboard went out of control and she cried out “Daddy” in fear, he stood by coldly, watching her fall and bleed from a head injury. 

\*\*\* 

But tonight, the drunken Lorenzo was affectionate with Winona, like a doting father. 

He gently set Winona down on the couch and smiled. “I’ll be a good dad.” 

“Yeah! I believe in you, Daddy.” 

Lorenzo didn’t respond. The smile on his face widened, and as he turned around, a name slipped from his mouth. 

“Tris.” 

So he was saying he would be a good dad to Tristan Duvall-Monica’s 

son. 

Evangeline’s heart broke. 

But Winona only heard the first sentence. She ran to Evangeline, brimming with joy. “Mommy, Mr. Craig likes me, right? Can I call him Daddy now? 

“He held me! And he said he’ll be a good dad!” 

Longing was evident in her eyes; she yearned desperately for a “yes.”

She really wished she could curl up in her father’s arms, call him Daddy, and play with him, just like other kids did.

She didn’t want to crush Winona’s hope, so she didn’t answer the question. 

She didn’t want Winona to know that this brief moment of happiness existed only because of another woman and her son. 

“Winnie, are you willing to leave with me?” Evangeline asked, forcing down her tears. 

Winona blinked in confusion. Her smile froze, her eyes welling up with tears. “Mommy, why do we have to leave?” 

“Daddy is part of our family, and I want to stay with him.” 

Evangeline gently wiped away her tears and sobbed, “Because the person Daddy truly loves has come back. We should go.” 

“But… Daddy likes me…” Winona’s voice trailed off. 

She probably knew Lorenzo didn’t love her. 

“Mommy, can we wait until after my birthday? Let’s give Daddy a few more chances, okay? Maybe he’ll love us then. If he’s willing to be with us, let’s stay, alright?” 

Evangeline nodded through tears. “Okay. You decide how many chances he gets.” 

She would give him a few chances. 

Should he disappoint them again, she would take Winona and never 

return.

1r8t47q,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1r8t47q/lengthy_queer_story_my_partner_is_withdrawing/,"Lengthy Queer Story: My partner is withdrawing, minimizing, and avoiding accountability, I finally laid everything out...","I need outside perspective because I feel like I am watching a pattern unfold in slow motion and my body is starting to react before my mind can rationalize it.

For a while now, I have been living with this push and pull dynamic. Some moments feel hopeful and soft, other moments feel cold and distant in a way that makes me feel like I am intruding just by existing. It has gotten to the point where I started scanning daily interactions for cues, not because I want to police him, but because the emotional temperature changes without warning.
Before the big conversation even happened, there were lots of small moments that built up. We share a home life that should feel intimate and safe, but lately it has felt fragile. There have been days where he is technically present but emotionally absent. No checking in. No warmth. No effort to repair after tension. A lot of silence. There have been moments where he responds to me like I am bothering him, then later acts normal. It leaves me confused and hypervigilant.

Valentine’s Day was a good example of how mixed things are. I (29,M, Arab) came home from work and wanted to go out with him (34,M, White) while it was still light. He took longer than expected, so by the time we left it was dark. I didn’t have a plan then, he suggested a neighborhood (angrily), I agreed. At first it was awkward. He was hangry and not hiding it, you could feel it in how he spoke and moved. Then we found sushi, sat in a cute romantic spot, ordered a Valentine special, and the dinner itself went well. We complimented each other and even had a few cute moments. I took a photo of himself, and asked how come he didnt yet! He said ""oh yeah"" hesitated and did it for the sake of doing it (you know).

 After that, he wanted to check out a new gay bar. On the way there I joked that if we go, I am not going to hide that I am his partner, like I might kiss him on the cheek. He laughed and asked what that means, and when I said a cheek kiss he responded with a flat “oh” in a cold unimpressed way. That small moment stung because it felt like affection with me is complicated and scarce, but his vibe in other contexts can be casual and open. We still went to the bar, sat for a bit, left, and came back, and the night was not a disaster, but it was another moment where I felt the imbalance sharply.

After that, there were also moments that seemed tender. I apologized to him in bed one night and he held my hand. I spooned him a little in the middle of the night. He no longer always turns away from me in bed like before. But then the next day I came home, went into his room the way we normally do, I asked casually “whooo was showering?” and he snapped “not me” in an irritated tone. I asked if he was okay and he said “yeah” shortly and just kept getting ready to leave for the gym without pausing. It is those whiplash shifts that have been wearing me down.

There was also a small moment that showed how he watches but does not always engage. I edited an inside joke into a text and he noticed even though edits don’t notify, he went back, saw it, and reacted with a laughing emoji. That is sweet in a small way, but it also reinforces that he is aware and present enough to notice details, yet he can still choose silence when it comes to emotional intimacy.

The tension kept building until he said out loud that he was considering breaking up (I had to ask if thats what he wants to get it out of him). That is when I stopped trying to hint or gently circle the issue. I put everything on the table, and I passionately spoke it all from a place of genuine care for this human being.

I told him I am not his enemy. I am not attacking him or judging him. I am his teammate. I want what is best for him and for us. But I cannot keep carrying everything alone and pretending it is fine.
I started by taking accountability for my isolation during the beginning of the genocide. Part of it was trauma. I genuinely did not know how to process watching my people suffer while continuing normal life. I witnessed people dying on live, people I had spoken to days before their martyrdom. I connected with queer Palestinians who were being blackmailed for survival. It was too much. I told him I am not designed to absorb that without consequences. He was merely allowing me the space to go through this but wasnt really by my side, engaged and protective, even when he knew I could be in danger due to my involvement in politics.

But I also admitted something else. Part of my isolation was me unconsciously mimicking his love language's level of intensity?. He communicates very little and tends to express love through quiet acts of service. So I pulled back verbally and emotionally while still maintaining reciprocal acts of service. I also intentionally stopped initiating as much because I realized I had been carrying most of the relationship, and it became too much to do that while also surviving the genocide psychologically in the U.S. with little support.

 I hoped that if I stepped back, he would step forward and carry some weight. I now understand that instead of balancing things, it made him feel shut out and pushed him away. That was not my intention. I apologized for the impact and told him I will not do that again now that I understand it, and I reminded him that when I say I won’t repeat something, I mean it.

Then I explained how alone I have felt in the relationship dynamic for a long time. I am usually the initiator. I call restaurants because he avoids communication. I ask to change tables. I plan birthdays. I plan hangouts. I initiate conversations. I initiate sex. I initiate hard discussions about politics. I told him I do not resent being proactive because I love taking care of people and especially him, but I wanted something like that back. I also told him I have adapted because I know he is not a nonchalant jerk, he truly struggles with communication, but adaptation is not the same as being carried.

One of the hardest parts for me to admit was that I can tell when he isn’t being fully honest even when he uses the hand gesture we established early in the relationship to signal seriousness and truth. That gesture was supposed to be an anchor. But over time I started noticing that sometimes the gesture would be there and something in his eyes would not match. The timing would be off. The energy would feel guarded. I would feel hesitation before the words landed. It is not about catching him in a dramatic lie. It is about sensing withholding, minimizing, or smoothing over something he is not ready to say. In those moments I have two options. I can press him and risk pushing him away, or I can accept what he says and carry the weight of knowing there is more underneath. Most of the time I chose to believe him because I did not want to become interrogative or controlling, but over time that gap erodes trust.

I asked him directly about the timeline pattern I have noticed. Around three to four years seems to be when his relationships start to unravel. I did not say it as an accusation. I asked it as pattern recognition. I asked if this is the stage where he starts emotionally withdrawing instead of addressing what needs repair. I asked if his past partners felt the same loneliness around communication. He admitted communication had been an issue before. I told him I am not afraid of hard seasons. I am afraid of unexamined cycles. If there is a pattern, it deserves to be confronted consciously instead of replayed unconsciously. I am not trying to trap him. I think he views commitment as restrictive. I am trying to see if he is willing to break patterns instead of repeat them, because growth at this stage of life has to be intentional if we want something long term.

I also told him about the imbalance that hurts me. I only hear “I love you” back after I say it first, but he seems comfortable leaving “hot,” “sexy,” and fire emojis on other men’s posts. Flirting outward looks easy and abundant, while affection inward feels scarce. That contrast makes me feel unchosen, even if he insists he cares.
I brought up painful moments that were never properly processed because of his avoidance. There was a song he sent me once that felt like one of the rare moments he expressed feelings through lyrics. I told him I have not listened to it more than twice on purpose because I do not want to memorize it. I want to be able to return to it and feel it fresh, like hearing his vulnerability for the first time again. That might sound dramatic, but for me it symbolizes how rare open expression can feel, and how carefully I hold those moments because they are not frequent.
I brought up that his friend Riley (F, 31) sexually assaulted me at the club and bit my ear. I went to get the CCTV footage. I went to the police station and almost filed a report. In therapy I realized part of my urgency was wanting him to react and protect me. Instead he had private conversations with her and her husband without me. I asked him how he thinks that made me feel, especially knowing he can talk to friends about what happened to me, but cannot sit with me and process it directly.

I brought up the breakfast with his friends where we were joking about things our parents say. I shared that my mom calling me her favorite puts pressure on me. He casually said “that’s why you left her.” The table went silent. Even his friends looked uncomfortable. I didn’t make a scene. I texted “wow” under the table because I was too hurt to speak. I cried privately. Later he broke down and apologized deeply, crying on the floor. I forgave him because I saw genuine shame and fear of saying the wrong thing, but the moment stayed with me as proof that communication wounds can happen without him realizing it, and then I am left carrying the injury alone until it finally surfaces.

I reminded him of waking up from nightmares of decapitated children in Gaza, crying in his arms, washing my face, and putting on a suit to attend his friend Julia’s wedding because it mattered to him that I show up. I reminded him of Lady Land, where I waited over three hours for him, he arrived extremely drunk, couldn’t find the entrance, got mad at me, and I ended up taking him home because he could barely stand. On the subway a homeless man almost attacked him, and I froze thinking I might have to physically intervene while he was incapacitated, and I felt helpless and small. We never processed it. I never got a real “I appreciate you, I see what you did, I’m sorry.” It was always a fleeting sorry followed by a redirect to something lighter like coffee or video games.

I brought up Max (his 9 year old nephew who's going to be under his care in the future) because it is not just about us. When Max started saying the N word, he avoided having the conversation. I asked him how he plans to navigate bigger talks when Max becomes a teenager, talks about sex, drugs, racism, bullying, identity. Avoiding hard talks does not make them disappear. It just passes the responsibility elsewhere. I was not attacking him as an uncle. I was pointing out that communication avoidance shows up across his life, not only with me.
I brought up that he wanted sexual experimentation, so I initiated and planned a foursome for us. He attended but did not converse with the people, did not share likes, dislikes, or boundaries, and left it to me to handle. He did not thank me. I brought up that he did not confront our roommate for using his bed for something sexually invasive, the same bed we sleep on, and when I finally confronted her, he said he probably should mention it too.
I brought up two examples that illustrate the same avoidance pattern. When he learned his biological father is alive, I asked if he had thought about reaching out, he said he never thought about it. When I asked if he had considered exploring medical options for his non hearing ear, especially since he loves music and loud spaces overwhelm him and ruin nights out, he said he never thought about it. The issue was not the specific answers. It was the pattern of not thinking about life and growth steps at all. I told him I do not want to force him into anything. My role is to encourage and support. But life cannot be lived entirely in avoidance. Growth requires initiative from within.

I told him I do not need perfection. I need presence. I need to hear “I see you,” “thank you,” and “I am sorry” when it matters. I reminded him he did not check on me when Netanyahu visited our city, even though politics directly impact my identity and family. I told him I started cooking more because he gets hangry, I bought cute containers to pack his meals, and I had to shyly ask him to wash dishes because I cannot cook and clean alone. I rarely hear appreciation. I brought up that his friend Kelly kicked me out and he did not mediate or defend me.

I also told him directly that I am not stupid. I see him texting his friends about our relationship while refraining from talking to me. I told him I reached out to his friends not to manipulate, but because I was desperate to know what is going on in my partner’s mind when he refuses to tell me. I told him I have learned to translate his feelings through behavior and body language because I cannot rely on words, and that is exhausting.

I also confronted the “static” narrative. He says he feels in stasis. I told him gently that the world is not static, life is not static, I am not static, and the relationship is not static. What is static is his internal avoidance, and it is not about the partners, it is about him. If every relationship becomes “stasis” at the same stage, then the common denominator is the pattern, not the person he is with.

He eventually broke down crying. He apologized and said it seems like he shut me out worse than I shut him out. He said “you kept trying and trying and I gave you nothing back.” I stopped him and told him that is not true. He did give things, he married me, he has shown up politically, he has confronted family at times, and I do see him trying, which is why I still believe he is capable of growth. But I told him I cannot carry this alone, it has to come from him.

After that conversation, the next day I checked in with him, not for an answer, just to see if he was okay. He initially thought I was demanding a decision and got irritated. I clarified that I was just checking because I love him and care, like did you eat, are you okay, do you want to talk before I leave. He softened, smiled, and we hugged.


Then last night happened. He bought dinner, I lay next to him, things felt normal, even soft. I showed him a funny video while he was getting ready for bed. He asked me something from across the room while the video was still loud. I didn’t hear him because I was trying to pause it. It took a couple taps. By the time it stopped, he was repeating his question angrily because he thought I was ignoring him. I was shocked. I asked if he would rather I sleep in my room, and he said “does it matter?” in an angry distant tone.

That question hit me harder than the misunderstanding. It wasn’t about the video. It was about whether my presence matters. I left to calm down, then texted explaining I genuinely couldn’t hear him, and that I wasn’t ignoring him. He apologized and said he doesn’t know why feeling ignored triggers him, especially since he mumbles and was far away. I reassured him I would never deliberately ignore him and I told him it does matter to me.

And on top of all this, there is the Valentine’s detail that pushed me over emotionally. He bought underwear, the same brand he usually gifts me during Valentines. The bag had hearts on it. He hesitated to give it to me, then returned it. When I confronted him, he said “it wasn’t a Valentine’s bag, it was just a [brand's name] bag but they put hearts on it.” I had already thanked him for thinking of me. It is not about the bag. It is about the retreat and then the minimization. If he said “I bought it and panicked,” I would have been hurt but grounded. Instead it felt like he rewrote the meaning to avoid owning the hesitation.

Maybe unnecessary details: it hurts in a way I don’t even know how to articulate to watch our roommate, (Trans White Woman, 30), who started as my friend, use the pet names I came up with for him, rub her cheek against his beard, hug him freely, and be met with warmth and ease, while I feel like I am rationed affection. I was struggling to even get an “I love you” back without initiating it first and now I get nothing back. The contrast is painful. It makes me feel displaced in my own relationship. I realize my isolation also made it seem like I abandoned her, but this feels like punishment when my isolation was a safety measure in a place foreign to me (geographically). There was also the day I found her dilating on his bed (she is trans), the same bed we sleep in and are intimate in. I asked him to set that boundary with her because it made me uncomfortable. He never did. I ended up telling her myself, and she apologized to me. I was left once again handling something that should have been his responsibility. And tonight, after minimizing the Valentine’s underwear and making me feel like I was overinterpreting something meaningful, he went out dancing with her while I stayed home crying. That juxtaposition is what cuts the deepest. It is not just about jealousy. It is about watching him show ease, playfulness, and social energy outward while I feel emotionally starved inward.

This is where I am now. The relationship is not explosive, it is tender and fragile and confusing. There is care, there are moments of softness, there are apologies. But there is also chronic avoidance and inconsistency that makes me feel alone, and I am starting to feel like whatever I do irritates him, and sometimes I wonder if he wants me to initiate leaving so he doesn’t have to be the one to end it.

When I imagine five more years of this pattern, my body tightens. I am not asking if he is evil. I am asking if this is emotional avoidance that can change with therapy and real effort, or if this is a fundamental mismatch where I over function and he under functions, and I will slowly shrink trying to keep the relationship alive.
I dont know what I need, I honestly just feel alone and gaslit and guilty and misunderstood and punished all at the same time and I'm scared being in this place we share all alone without family here..

I guess the only good thing that came out of this is how comfortably I talked to my sister about this for an advice and some support she generously gave, despite not understanding my sexual orientation. It brought us closer and I always dreamed of leaning on my sister when it comes to my love life so.. ♡",0,1771487079.0,emotionalintelligence,0,0.5,False

**Chapter 1** 

My husband asked me to go to the office ten minutes early to make coffee for his secretary. When I refused, he completely lost it. 

“Sophia loves her morning coffee. Is it really that hard for you to spend ten minutes making it for her?**”** 

I shook my head, and he stormed out, slamming the door after throwing down a pile of documents. 

“Fine, Lily Evans, you’re fired! Don’t come back tomorrow!” 

As I looked at the papers scattered across the floor, I felt utterly disappointed in Ethan Cole. Without hesitation, I dialed an international number: “I’m willing to accept your offer. I’ll start next week.” 

The moment I hung up, Sophia Moore walked right into my office without even knocking, moving about as if she owned the place. 

“Lily, who were you talking to? It sounded like a man’s voice.” 

Her insinuations sparked curiosity from those outside the door, and soon everyone was craning their necks to catch the gossip. 

“Mr. Cole just stormed out angry. Don’t tell me you’re sneaking around with another man behind his back!” 

I looked her straight in the eye. “Who taught you to speak like that? Spreading sexual rumors comes with legal consequences!” 

Sophia scoffed. “Please. I’m just stating facts. Even if Mr. Cole walked back in right now, I’d say the same thing.” 

I glared at her and turned to leave, but she grabbed my arm. Leaning closer, she lowered her voice into a threat. 

“Lily Evans, you’d better step away from Ethan. I’m the one he wants now.” 

“If you know what’s good for you, divorce him and get out of this company. Otherwise, don’t blame me for what comes next.” 

I couldn’t believe how far a mere secretary thought she could go. 

Just as I was about to shake her off, she suddenly flung herself to the ground. 

“Ethan, you’re finally back!” 

I turned toward the doorway and saw Ethan Cole storming in, fury in his eyes. 

Without a word, his hand cracked across my face. 

I stumbled back, hitting the edge of the coffee table, pain spreading instantly across my temple. 

“Lily Evans, what are you doing?!**”**

Her pitiful act tugged at Ethan’s heartstrings. He knelt beside her, worried and tender, completely ignoring the blood on my forehead and the red marks across my cheek.

**Chapter 1** 

My husband asked me to go to the office ten minutes early to make coffee for his secretary. When I refused, he completely lost it. 

“Sophia loves her morning coffee. Is it really that hard for you to spend ten minutes making it for her?**”** 

I shook my head, and he stormed out, slamming the door after throwing down a pile of documents. 

“Fine, Lily Evans, you’re fired! Don’t come back tomorrow!” 

As I looked at the papers scattered across the floor, I felt utterly disappointed in Ethan Cole. Without hesitation, I dialed an international number: “I’m willing to accept your offer. I’ll start next week.” 

The moment I hung up, Sophia Moore walked right into my office without even knocking, moving about as if she owned the place. 

“Lily, who were you talking to? It sounded like a man’s voice.” 

Her insinuations sparked curiosity from those outside the door, and soon everyone was craning their necks to catch the gossip. 

“Mr. Cole just stormed out angry. Don’t tell me you’re sneaking around with another man behind his back!” 

I looked her straight in the eye. “Who taught you to speak like that? Spreading sexual rumors comes with legal consequences!” 

Sophia scoffed. “Please. I’m just stating facts. Even if Mr. Cole walked back in right now, I’d say the same thing.” 

I glared at her and turned to leave, but she grabbed my arm. Leaning closer, she lowered her voice into a threat. 

“Lily Evans, you’d better step away from Ethan. I’m the one he wants now.” 

“If you know what’s good for you, divorce him and get out of this company. Otherwise, don’t blame me for what comes next.” 

I couldn’t believe how far a mere secretary thought she could go. 

Just as I was about to shake her off, she suddenly flung herself to the ground. 

“Ethan, you’re finally back!” 

I turned toward the doorway and saw Ethan Cole storming in, fury in his eyes. 

Without a word, his hand cracked across my face. 

I stumbled back, hitting the edge of the coffee table, pain spreading instantly across my temple. 

“Lily Evans, what are you doing?!**”** 

Before I could speak, Sophia burst into tears, playing her part.

“Mr. Cole, Lily told me to pick up the papers on the floor. I was a little slow, so she shoved me down! My ankle feels twisted–it hurts ‘so much!” 

Her pitiful act tugged at Ethan’s heartstrings. He knelt beside her, worried and tender, completely ignoring the blood on my forehead and the red marks across my cheek. 

“Where does it hurt? I’ll call a doctor for you right now.” 

“I’ll have them prescribe the best medicine–you’ll recover quickly, I promise.” 

Sophia leaned into his arms, but her eyes flicked toward me with a smug smile. 

“No need, Mr. Cole… It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have upset Lily. She’s just in a bad mood lately. Once she vents, she’ll be fine. I’m okay.” 

“She’s in a bad mood, so she gets to shove people?” Ethan snapped, his eyes sharp as ice. 

“When did you become so vicious, Lily Evans?” 

Vicious? My fingers brushed the warm blood on my temple. Three years of marriage- managing his company’s affairs, caring for his sick mother, even pawning my inheritance jewelry during his failed startup–and in his eyes, I was nothing but a cruel woman. 

“I didn’t push her.”

1r8swzs,https://i.redd.it/min4fbtbmekg1.jpeg,Dhumavati Sadhna Experiences,"There is very limited authentic information about Dhumavati available in books. Even the most knowledgeable experts have spoken very little about her. That may be why figures like Rajarshi Nandy rarely go into detail, and why platforms like the Sadhana App only provide general information about the Mahavidyas.

Dhumavati is not something that can be openly described in detail. If that were done, you would see YouTube Shorts and misinformation videos everywhere. Even the videos that mention Nahar Singh mostly recycle basic information taken from such sources.

Nahar Singhs are real, and sadhanas for direct Nahar Singh manifestation do exist—manifestations where the entity can physically appear before you. But such sadhanas are extremely dangerous. Period.

I’m sharing only a few small fragments of experiences related to Dhumavati. Interestingly, a person I met who practiced for 17 years had nothing concrete to share about her experiences. Still, I’ll list some observations here for the public to read.

* Your eyes stop blinking normally. You can keep them open effortlessly for hours—maybe blinking only 7–8 times a day. To appear normal in public, I consciously blink more often.
* You might pay someone ₹100 for coffee or food, and they return ₹500 as change—without realizing it.
* People who try to harm or insult you end up facing accidents, humiliation, or setbacks. Small actions bring small consequences. Dont imagine what the bigger actions wale get. She prioritizes you intensely and protects you fiercely—you become precious to her.
* Entities don’t attack easily. If you enter someone else’s domain, they often come first to communicate, asking you not to interfere, explaining how the situation is a result of that person’s own karma.
* You begin to act without overthinking. She works fast. Your subconscious becomes far more efficient and responsive.
* Her energy is extremely dense. Even a fraction—0.000001—can induce deep meditation in others. Many people cannot tolerate the intoxication of her name or presence. Naam ka nasha is so powerful that even hardcore drug users can abandon addictions.
* You gain access to memories from childbirth to the present—events you never consciously remembered before. Not going to past lives or stuff in this post.
* With her grace, you can stay awake for days without exhaustion.
* Your body becomes resilient to extreme weather and harsh conditions.
* Your tongue can detect the true nature of food. Even freshly cooked food prepared with negativity or unhealthy intent—something others cannot sense—becomes immediately apparent.
* Diseases don’t linger. Even minor fevers or coughs disappear within hours.
* Exams and studies become easier because the mind remains largely free of unnecessary thoughts.
* There is much more. I may write a detailed post someday and edit this with more experiences. I’d genuinely like to connect with others who are her sadhaks.
* When you stop asking the deity for things and simply do mantra japa, many good things start happening automatically. When I say I can see her with my physical eyes, I mean it literally. The first time I saw her, I was lying on a cot outside one afternoon and suddenly thought, What the hell—something just passed across the sky?

This is why people don’t openly talk about what actually happens during Dhumavati upasana. I’ve been connected to her for almost 13–14 years—not as a formal sadhana, but simply because I love taking her name and doing her mantra japa.

I would think if or 6 extra colossi were put in, it could be that the 16 colossi were made from the remains of those 6. Or 5 colossi. 6 from each one.

Or has there been some evidence establishing how the colossi were made?

Plus the sword could of been shaped into what it is due to the blood of Dormin? Was a regular blade that absorbed some essence of him?

Just had the idea of a prequel where it shows how the colossi and sword were created.

And for the 5 colossi that split into 6, had the thought of how each would represent elements of the soul.

Like I think one could be ""Spirit"". And could be interpreted for elements like fire, water, air and earth.

Then another would be ""Mind"", which could represent humanoid like colossi.

Cause for this I want to look at it in a way that gives it a deep meaning. Like how I mentioned of how the 5 colossi that split into the ones we know are based on the elements and aspects of the soul.

And as to how the sword was made into what it is in the game.

Cause I mentioned on how Dormins blood would be involved. And how his entire essence was absorbed into it after his body was destroyed.

Then the sword was used to split each piece. By slaying these colossi, and have their elements affect and shape each piece into the colossi in the game.

That way it could explain why and how the sword can locate the colossi and pieces of Dormin. And why it can slay them as well as release Dormins pieces

Not saying this as a theory, no evidence to support it. But its just a silly interpretation that I randomly thought of while coffee randomly kicked in while watching a video about the cut colossi.

Rambling of a madman for sure 😆

Also for colossi type theres several: 

I-Minotaur
II-Bipedal
III-Humanoid
IV-Bipedal
V-Bird
VI-Minotaur
VII-Serpent
VIII-Lizard
IX-Bipedal
X-Serpent
XI-Feline
XII-Bipedal
XIII-Serpent
XIV-Feline
XV-Minotaur
XVI-Humanoid

So 3 serpents, 3 minotaurs, 1 bird, 1 lizard, 2 humanoid, 2 feline, 4 bipedal.

For Roc, Phoenix and Bird would be 3 avians then. Yamori A and lizard would be 2 lizards, if worm is included itd be 4 serpents, if Devil is included it could be 3 humanoids then, griffin id say would be bipedal, same for Sirius and Evis so thatd be 7 bipedal. Saru would be its own category, so 1 mammal. And Spider is 1 insect.

So 26 colossi in total I think? So why not go to 30? 4 new colossi for this.

What if a colossi was referred as a chameleon? It would camouflage itself and to find it would it with steam and smoke. Only sound would be its footsteps. And it can attack by spitting out its tongue, or sneaking up on you to tail swipe you.

 A mirror could be used.

I picture its arena as having vast large hallways.

Its design i picture as elegant, with its fur being all smooth, but cracked skin. As if its scalp buildup or dried skin.",2,1771486141.0,ShadowoftheColossus,0,1.0,False

# Location/temp range/specific trip description:

Primarily hiking across Europe in 3-season conditions.

Expecting variable weather, rain, wind, and temperatures roughly between 5–30°C depending on elevation and season.

⸻

# Goal Baseweight (BPW):

Current baseweight is \~8.9kg.

Long-term goal is to move toward \~6.5–7kg while keeping the system sustainable and realistic for longer distance hiking.

⸻

# Budget:

Moderate. I’m willing to invest in meaningful upgrades over time, but not looking to replace everything at once. Big purchases need to make long-term sense.

⸻

# Non-negotiable Items:

• Coffee setup

• 20,000mAh powerbank (budget constraint, not replacing with an expensive lighter alternative right now)

• Full shelter (not ready to switch to tarp-only yet)

⸻

Solo or with another person?:

Mostly solo. Occasionally sharing tent weight with a partner.

⸻

# Additional Information:

I’m trying to build a gear list that could theoretically support longer distance hiking — not just short weekend trips. I want something scalable and sustainable.

I’m aware my tent (Big Agnes Copper Spur UL3) is heavy. I’m considering a Durston X-Mid 2 as a future upgrade.

My backpack is an Osprey Kestrel 38 (not a long-term solution and likely to be replaced eventually).

I’m not aiming for extreme SUL, but I do want to move thoughtfully toward a lighter, more efficient setup.

I’d appreciate structural feedback:

• Where would you start cutting weight?

• Any obvious redundancies?

• Is my clothing system overbuilt?

• Best weight savings per € invested?

• Anything that stands out as unnecessary?

I’m open to honest feedback.

My school hosts guest lecturers, and today we had one of the most prestigious speakers we’ve had: a retired U.S. Ambassador with 33 years of experience. I used to want to become an ambassador when I was younger, so listening to her speak made me feel inspired. 

Maybe it was my ADHD meds kicking in, but I decided to lock in. I sat in the front row. 

When we got to questions, I was able to ask the first question. I asked how she found common ground across different systems and cultures, and then followed up about navigating opposition as a woman working in places like Afghanistan. Specifically because I as a young woman would like to enter that same kind of space. 

After the lecture I introduced myself and shook her hand. Then I attended her second talk even though it wasn’t required. I actually paid attention the whole time. I spoke to the people around me. (Which allowed me to get the favor of a few cool people!)

Afterwards I went up to talk to her again. Shake her hand, thank her, and discuss policy. At the end she mentioned she had just moved to the area to work with the school. She told me to add her on LinkedIn so we can get a coffee together. She would like to talk to me more and help me get to the places I want to

I haven't tasted it yet since it's cooling now, but I just want to know if it looks okay or if you wouldn't eat it at all. I am at least happy that the baking powder this time worked and it went up, so I didn't bother much on decorations lmao. 

  
I would like to sell something like this, of course it needs improvement aesthetically but let's say I invite you over and offer you a slice with coffee. in that scenario, is it acceptable since it's a ""hangout banana bread"" or still looks gross? please be brutally honest I'm learning and I like it the tough way lol.

My wife and I are hoping to visit Australia this summer. We are ideally going to do a layover in Fiji for a day or two coming from California. 

So far we are leaning towards Sydney as a friend has visited and recommended it but we are pretty open to both Sydney and Melbourne. 

Do folks recommend one over the other in June? We are big on walking, public transit, museums, good coffee/food etc. We are definitely interested in day nature trips where pick up/drop offs are possible but don't feel confident in driving a rental ourselves. 

Any advice in how you might spend 5 days in each and which you'd ultimately recommend?

Thank you in advance!",1,1771485817.0,AustraliaTravel,14,0.67,False

Chapter 1 

My daughter was critically ill, and we desperately needed a large sum for her treatment. 

Yet, my Alpha mate, Mason, outright refused to pay. He simply gave up on our daughter, turned his back, and ran into the arms of his childhood sweetheart, Thea Allen. 

In that moment of utter despair, my first love,Alpha Adrian, appeared like a lifeline. He transferred five million into my account and stayed by my side, tenderly helping me care for our little girl. 

But in the end, she still couldn’t escape death’s cruel grasp. 

Six years later, I was pregnant with Adrian’s child. 

During a solo prenatal checkup at the hospital, I accidentally overheard a conversation between Adrian and the pack 

doctor, 

“Alpha, now that you and Luna are expecting your own child… what if the truth about what happened back then comes 

to light?” 

“When Thea was critically ill, using certain… methods to transplant that child’s heart into her was a desperate necessity. 

Besides, Sophia is having a baby now. She should be able to move on.” 

In that instant, my world shattered. I finally understood,my daughter hadn’t died from a misdiagnosed illness. She had 

been deliberately misdiagnosed. Adrian had secretly taken her heart and transplanted it into Thea. 

Tears streamed down my face silently. 

So this life growing inside me now was no testament to love between Adrian and me. It was an offering of atonement. 

All these six years of affection had been Adrian’s elaborate act, a charade for his true destined mate, his one and only 

beloved, Thea. 

I gently touched my slightly rounded belly, a bitter smile curling my lips. 

Six years ago, I couldn’t save my daughter. Now, I had no desire to continue this cursed relationship. 

In the hospital office, the pack doctor sighed softly, his tone tinged with pity. 

“Very well, Alpha. But is this truly worth it? Miss Thea Allen has already bonded with another. You should live your own 

life. After all, Luna loves you deeply. She’s a good woman.” 

There was a pause before Adrian replied with firm resolve: 

“How could it not be worth it? I care nothing for titles or bonds. As long as I can watch over Thea, protect her, that’s 

enough. She’s free to love whomever she wishes. I only need her to be healthy and happy.” 

‘As for Sophia… she is indeed wonderful. A good mate, and she’ll be a good mother. It’s just.. I don’t love her. You can’t 

force love.” 

Chapter 1

Hearing this, the doctor shook his head and didn’t press further. 

‘Luna’s pregnancy is very unstable. She has suffered greatly, having already lost one child. This time, please be kind to 

her and the baby.” 

A long silence followed before Adrian finally responded with a soft, “Mm.” 

I bit my lip hard, stubbornly refusing to make a sound. 

Only after Adrian and the doctor left did I break down, sobbing uncontrollably. 

So, my newborn daughter has not die of disease. She had been intentionally misdiagnosed after Adrian bribed the pack 

hospital. All to give Thea with a fresh. healthy heart. 

Back then, after my daughter was diagnosed and admitted in the NICU, my former mate,Alpha Mason, saw her as a 

burden. He washed his hands of the whole thing. walked out of the hospital, and ran straight into Thea’s waiting arms. 

Adrian’s arrival had been the only ray of light in our darkness. 

Now, looking back, Adrian’s help was likely just to better safeguard the heart destined for Thea. 

After I dissolved my mating bond with Mason, Adrian married me.probably driven by nothing more than guilt. 

Leaving the hospital, I stepped into a downpour. 

I did not call for a car. Like a drowned rat, I staggered home, drenched to the bone. 

Rain mixed with tears, I’d long lost count of how many times I’d cried. 

When I finally got home, the housekeeper, Mrs. Anderson, saw my bedraggled, broken state and hurried over. 

“Luna! Why didn’t you call the driver in this rain? You’re with child,catching a chill is the last thing you need.” 

Hearing the commotion, Adrian came out of his study. Seeing my red–rimmed eyes and disheveled hair, a flicker of 

something remorse crossed his eyes. He set down his coffee cup and scooped me into his arms. 

His tone held a note of reproach, “You’re going to be a mother. How can you still be so reckless like a child?” 

“You could catch a cold, but what if you hurt the baby? **I** really don’t know what to do with you.” 

I glanced at him and murmured, almost to myself, ‘Adrian, **I’ve** been a mother before. You don’t need to teach me.‘ 

“If this child dies, it dies. After all, I’ve already lost one.” 

Adrian’s steps hitched. His brow furrowed, but in the end, he said nothing. 

The bathtub was already filled with hot water. Adrian tried to help me out of my wet clothes, but I refused and pushed 

**his** hands away. 

He looked at me suspiciously, clearly puzzled by my abnormal behavior.

So, my newborn daughter has not die of disease. She had been intentionally misdiagnosed after Adrian bribed the pack 

hospital. All to give Thea with a fresh. healthy heart. 

Back then, after my daughter was diagnosed and admitted in the NICU, my former mate,Alpha Mason, saw her as a 

burden. He washed his hands of the whole thing. walked out of the hospital, and ran straight into Thea’s waiting arms. 

Adrian’s arrival had been the only ray of light in our darkness. 

Now, looking back, Adrian’s help was likely just to better safeguard the heart destined for Thea. 

After I dissolved my mating bond with Mason, Adrian married me.probably driven by nothing more than guilt. 

Leaving the hospital, I stepped into a downpour. 

I did not call for a car. Like a drowned rat, I staggered home, drenched to the bone. 

Rain mixed with tears, I’d long lost count of how many times I’d cried. 

When I finally got home, the housekeeper, Mrs. Anderson, saw my bedraggled, broken state and hurried over. 

“Luna! Why didn’t you call the driver in this rain? You’re with child,catching a chill is the last thing you need.” 

Hearing the commotion, Adrian came out of his study. Seeing my red–rimmed eyes and disheveled hair, a flicker of 

something remorse crossed his eyes. He set down his coffee cup and scooped me into his arms. 

His tone held a note of reproach, “You’re going to be a mother. How can you still be so reckless like a child?” 

“You could catch a cold, but what if you hurt the baby? **I** really don’t know what to do with you.” 

I glanced at him and murmured, almost to myself, ‘Adrian, **I’ve** been a mother before. You don’t need to teach me.‘ 

“If this child dies, it dies. After all, I’ve already lost one.” 

Adrian’s steps hitched. His brow furrowed, but in the end, he said nothing. 

The bathtub was already filled with hot water. Adrian tried to help me out of my wet clothes, but I refused and pushed 

**his** hands away. 

He looked at me suspiciously, clearly puzzled by my abnormal behavior. 

Chapter 1 

**10.00%** 

After **a** tense standoff, Adrian finally left the bathroom. 

In the mirror**,** I saw the mating mark on my neck. It was no longer as vivid as it before, it had faded, grown dull. 

I scrubbed my skin raw with soap.again and again, as if trying to wash away every trace Adrian had left on me over all these years.

1r8snss,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1r8snss/my_4month_relationship_with_a_moderate/,My 4-month relationship with a moderate fearful-avoidant ended in silence after I finally asked for reciprocity — I’m realizing I was never going to “win” the frame game,"I dated a girl for 4 months who — according to my AI (which I fed every single text, call log, fight, and interaction we ever had) — is a moderate fearful-avoidant. I did this because I was desperate to understand why she could be so close and loving one day, then vanish into silence the next.

Early on we had insane chemistry. She made me feel like we’d been together for years. She told me “this is forever,” “soulmates,” “I love you” — and it felt real. She shared deep secrets, cried in my arms, let me see parts of her no one else did. We had sex that felt like making love, not just fucking. I thought we had something rare.

Then I made a mistake: about a month in I had a platonic conversation with an ex-fling from 4 years ago (nothing romantic, just catching up). She found out, freaked out, and I immediately apologized and owned it. Somehow I convinced her to stay. From that point forward the power dynamic shifted — I felt like she was “giving me a chance,” and I was always on thin ice. I became the one who was “wrong” after that. I couldn’t ask for anything without it turning into a lecture or her pulling away.

I tried everything. My AI helped me craft responses, told me to hold frame, stay calm, mirror her effort, let her come to me, wait for warm moments to bring up needs. And it worked… for a while. She’d thaw, text more, call, stay over 4–5 nights in a row, say I love you. But it was always conditional. The second I asked for mutual affection (a random coffee she paid for, her initiating texts, her asking about my feelings), she’d freeze, deflect, or disappear for days. Sex was great, but emotional intimacy? Almost impossible unless she initiated it.

Then I noticed she never offered to pay for anything. She expected me to cover purses, expensive outings, dinners — everything. I’m traditional so I didn’t mind paying most of the time, but the gesture of her splitting a bill or buying me a coffee once would’ve meant the world. It started to feel like she was using me for money/comfort while giving “love” in exchange — and I don’t even think she realized it. It was just her default.

I planned to bring it up calmly. I wanted mutual affection, emotional safety, to know what a relationship meant to her. But when I tried, my frustration leaked out. She got defensive, I called her out on shutting me down, she stormed off. I chased her to the car asking if we were done — she screamed “get the fuck away from me,” slammed the door, sent an angry text blaming me for not listening/stopping, and went silent.

That was it. Complete radio silence. We rarely fought before — usually she’d get jealous and lecture me, and I found it cute because it showed she cared. Now nothing. No apology, no “I miss you,” no “let’s talk.” Just gone.

I blocked her on socials because I couldn’t keep checking if she viewed my stories. 

I’m realizing she’s not going to change for me. She wants love on her terms — convenient, low-pressure, no real emotional labor. If she reaches out (my AI says 70–90% chance in 2–8 weeks, probably a casual “hey”), it’ll be for comfort, not change. And I’ll probably let her back in… then break up again when the pattern repeats.

I hate that I still love her. I hate that I believed the “soulmates” and “forever” talk. I hate that I’m still hoping she’ll reconsider.

But I’m done chasing. I’m done holding frame for someone who won’t hold it for me.

Anyone else been through this with a fearful-avoidant? How long did it take to stop caring? Did they ever come back with real change, or just breadcrumbs?

Thanks for reading. I needed to get it out.

TL;DR: Dated a moderate FA for 4 months. Felt like soulmates until I asked for mutual effort. Fight escalated, she stormed off, ghosted. I blocked socials, left  whatsapp open. Now I’m grieving something that was real but unsustainable. Trying to accept she’ll never change for me.",1,1771485382.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

Scene 1: The Seduction

“I notice the way you hesitate when you speak, the flicker of doubt in your eyes. Perfect. I smile warmly, lean in slightly, and mirror your body language. Every word I say is chosen to make you feel understood.

Texting later, I wait exactly two hours before replying. Not too long, not too short. Just enough for you to check your phone, wonder what I’m doing, feel the tiniest spike of anxiety. Then I send a message—charming, witty, just enough warmth to reel you in. You reread it three times. I smile. My first thread is in place.”

⸻

Scene 2: The Hook

“We meet for coffee. I compliment your passion, your ideas, your humor. I subtly hint that not everyone notices your brilliance like I do. I see your chest rise slightly, your pupils dilate. You are aware of it, but not why it feels so good.

That night, I send a small, cryptic text: ‘I’ve been thinking about you today…’ You analyze every word, every comma, every emoji. That’s perfect. I feed on your mental energy.”

⸻

Scene 3: The Pullback

“Two days later, silence. No text, no call. Your mind races. Did I get upset? Did I do something wrong? That anxiety, that obsession… it’s mine.

When we meet again, I act casual, distant, but attentive enough to make you crave more. I let a tiny critique slip—a joke about something you said. You replay it all night. I am invisible, yet absolute.”

Scene 4: The Devaluation

“At dinner, I subtly tease you. You laugh nervously, unsure if I’m serious. I nod as if I’m joking, but the seed is planted. Later, a small comment online, public but indirect: it’s just enough to make you doubt yourself in front of others. I see the panic flicker in your eyes. Another thread woven, another tug on the leash.”

⸻

Scene 5: The Discard

“I disappear. I ignore texts for days. You wonder what you did, what I’m thinking, why I vanished. I watch you obsess quietly, replaying memories, reading between every line, trying to rationalize me. That is my victory. I left gaps for your mind to fill—and you fill them with me.

A short text after a week: ‘We need space.’ You feel the sting, the rejection. Perfect. You are still orbiting me, still trapped in my psychological gravity.”

⸻

Scene 6: The Hoover

“I reappear randomly. A late-night message: ‘I miss you.’ You respond, immediately, hoping. I reply slowly, cryptically, just enough to confuse, to tease, to make you doubt your worth. Every interaction is a game, every reaction mine to study.

Even your attempt to move on, to forget me, is observed, analyzed, and used. You cannot escape. I exist in your thoughts, your dreams, your fears. You are my resource; your obsession, my trophy.”",1,1771485219.0,u_ItsMeQuevhennLlameg,0,1.0,False

There's something undeniably magical about that first sip of morning coffee. The rich aroma, the comforting warmth, the subtle dance of flavors on your tongue – it’s a daily ritual for millions. But have you ever noticed how some coffee experiences just hit different? It's not always about the beans or the brew method; often, it's about the environment. The concept of a ""cozee space"" plays a surprisingly significant role in elevating your daily coffee ritual from a simple habit to a truly delightful experience. The right atmosphere can amplify flavors, soothe your mind, and turn a hurried gulp into a moment of pure bliss. Let's explore how creating or finding a cozee space can profoundly impact your coffee enjoyment.

# Understanding Cozee Spaces

So, what exactly defines a ""cozee space""? It’s more than just a comfortable room; it’s an environment that evokes feelings of warmth, comfort, and security. Think of it as a hug for your senses. Cozee spaces are intentionally designed to make you feel at ease, creating an inviting atmosphere that encourages lingering and relaxation.

Several elements contribute to this special ambiance:

* **Lighting:** Soft, warm lighting is key. Dimmer switches, lamps with diffused light, or even natural light streaming through a window can create a gentle glow that's far more relaxing than harsh overhead fluorescents.
* **Seating:** Comfort is paramount. Plush armchairs, cushioned sofas, or even a well-padded window seat invite you to sink in and stay a while. The idea is to have seating that encourages good posture and relaxation, rather than quick turnovers.
* **Decor:** Personal touches make a huge difference. Think throws and blankets, soft rugs, plants, books, and art that speaks to you. Textures like wood, wool, and linen add to the tactile comfort. The decor should feel lived-in and loved, not sterile or stark.
* **Sound:** A cozee space often has a pleasant soundscape – perhaps soft background music, the gentle hum of conversation, or even just the quiet peace that allows for contemplation. Harsh noises are a definite no-no.
* **Aroma:** Subtle, pleasant scents can enhance the cozee feel. This might be the natural aroma of fresh coffee, a subtle candle, or even just the clean smell of a well-maintained space.

Together, these elements create a sanctuary where you can truly unwind and savor your coffee.

# The Science of Taste and Environment

It might sound surprising, but the environment you're in has a profound impact on your taste perception. Our senses are deeply interconnected, and what we see, hear, and feel can influence how we interpret flavors.

* **Influence of aroma:** The sense of smell is intricately linked to taste. A pleasant environment often has subtle, agreeable aromas that can enhance the perceived flavor of your coffee. Conversely, stale or unpleasant odors can detract from it. The rich, inviting scent of brewing coffee is a significant part of its appeal, and a cozee space allows this aroma to be enjoyed fully without being overwhelmed by other smells.
* **Impact of lighting on mood:** Warm, soft lighting can induce a state of relaxation and contentment. When you're relaxed, your brain is more open to experiencing pleasure, including the nuanced flavors of your coffee. Bright, harsh lighting, on the other hand, can create tension and make it harder to focus on sensory details.
* **Temperature and comfort levels:** Physical comfort plays a huge role. If you're too cold, too hot, or sitting on an uncomfortable chair, your focus will be on your discomfort rather than your coffee. A comfortable temperature and cozy seating allow you to truly relax and appreciate the subtle notes of your brew. Studies have even shown that holding a warm beverage in a comfortable setting can increase feelings of warmth and generosity towards others.

Essentially, a cozee environment primes your brain and body to be more receptive to enjoyment, making your coffee taste not just good, but *great*.

# Benefits of Enjoying Coffee in a Cozee Space

# 1. Enhanced Flavor Experience

When all your other senses are being pampered, your taste buds are free to do their best work. A cozee setting minimizes distractions and discomfort, allowing you to truly focus on the complex flavors and aromas of your coffee. You might notice the subtle notes of chocolate, nuts, fruit, or florals that you’d otherwise miss in a busy or stressful environment. It’s like turning up the volume on your sensory perception, making each sip a richer, more profound experience. The comfort and relaxation allow for a mindful appreciation of the brew.

# 2. Increased Relaxation

Beyond just taste, a cozee space offers significant psychological benefits. It provides a refuge from the hustle and bustle of daily life, offering a moment of peace and tranquility. This mental break is crucial for stress reduction and overall well-being. Sipping coffee in such a space becomes a meditative act, allowing you to clear your head, gather your thoughts, or simply enjoy a quiet moment. This sense of calm contributes to a greater feeling of satisfaction and rejuvenation, making your coffee much more than just a caffeine delivery system.

# 3. Social Interaction

While often associated with personal solace, cozee spaces are also fantastic for fostering social connection. The inviting atmosphere naturally encourages people to slow down, relax, and engage in meaningful conversations. Whether it’s catching up with a friend, having a deep discussion with a loved one, or even meeting new people, the comfortable setting makes interactions feel more natural and unforced. Cafes designed with cozee nooks and communal tables often become hubs for community building, proving that comfort can indeed breed connection.

# Comparison Table of Coffee Experiences

To further illustrate the impact, let's compare the experience of enjoying coffee in a cozee space versus a regular, less considered environment:

|**Factor**|**Cozee Space Experience**|**Regular Space Experience**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Flavor Perception|Higher|Lower|
|Comfort Level|High|Low|
|Relaxation|Enhanced|Minimal|
|Social Engagement|High|Low|

# Tips for Creating Your Own Cozee Coffee Space

You don't need a fancy budget or a professional decorator to create your own personal oasis. With a few thoughtful touches, you can transform any corner of your home into a cozee coffee haven.

* **Use soft lighting:** Ditch the harsh overhead lights. Opt for table lamps, floor lamps, or string lights with warm-toned bulbs. A dimmer switch can work wonders. If you have natural light, arrange your space to make the most of it.
* **Choose comfortable seating:** A plush armchair with a soft throw, a comfy beanbag, or even a stack of floor cushions can make a huge difference. Add some decorative pillows for extra back support and a touch of color.
* **Incorporate personal decor:** Surround yourself with things you love. This could be books, photos, plants, art, or souvenirs from your travels. These items add personality and make the space feel uniquely yours.
* **Add textures:** Layering different textures like a wool throw, a faux fur rug, and linen curtains can make a space feel instantly warmer and more inviting.
* **Introduce pleasant aromas:** A subtle scented candle, an essential oil diffuser, or even a bowl of fresh oranges can add to the sensory experience.
* **Keep it tidy:** A cluttered space can feel chaotic and prevent true relaxation. Keep your cozee corner clean and organized.

Calicut, known for its vibrant culture and delicious food, also boasts some incredible cafes perfect for a cozee coffee experience.

One of these trips was to Thailand, where I lived for 9 months. I could eat absolutely anything and my bloating was never an issue.

Second trip away was a holiday in a hostel in the country I live in. I didn’t enjoy it, horrendously sunburnt on the first day which made me super stressed out, living in a hostel and unable to do anything the rest of the trip. I felt trapped in a noisy hostel. I was drinking a lot and not particularly active.

Now most people will say it was the stress factor - but is it? In my job now I don’t feel very stressed. I was much worse in the hostel when sunburnt. I do however sit at my desk most of the day, although I’m trying to get my step count up on lunch etc.

My new theory is that being sat at a desk is compressing my intestines somehow, causing a build up of stool and gas. This issue started 3 years ago at a desk job (although after a very traumatic experience admittedly) and then disappeared when I moved to Thailand. I then arrived in Aus and was fine too - and then my bloating has come back with a force since working back at my desk.

I’ve cut out various things including coffee & vaping (which were fine to do in Thailand) and I thought I was onto something with stopping coffee (see morning post) however after 3 x grilled chicken breast for lunch I am now looking 9 months pregnant again.

1r8s5kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1r8s5kj/lengthy_queer_story_my_partner_is_withdrawing/,"Lengthy Queer Story: My partner is withdrawing, minimizing, and avoiding accountability, I finally laid everything out hoping for improvement...","Sorry that it's long. I regularly conduct research and write academically, so details and contexts are important to me:

I need outside perspective because I feel like I am watching a pattern unfold in slow motion and my body is starting to react before my mind can rationalize it.

For a while now, I have been living with this push and pull dynamic. Some moments feel hopeful and soft, other moments feel cold and distant in a way that makes me feel like I am intruding just by existing. It has gotten to the point where I started scanning daily interactions for cues, not because I want to police him, but because the emotional temperature changes without warning.
Before the big conversation even happened, there were lots of small moments that built up. We share a home life that should feel intimate and safe, but lately it has felt fragile. There have been days where he is technically present but emotionally absent. No checking in. No warmth. No effort to repair after tension. A lot of silence. There have been moments where he responds to me like I am bothering him, then later acts normal. It leaves me confused and hypervigilant.

Valentine’s Day was a good example of how mixed things are. I (29,M, Arab) came home from work and wanted to go out with him (34,M, White) while it was still light. He took longer than expected, so by the time we left it was dark. I didn’t have a plan then, he suggested a neighborhood (angrily), I agreed. At first it was awkward. He was hangry and not hiding it, you could feel it in how he spoke and moved. Then we found sushi, sat in a cute romantic spot, ordered a Valentine special, and the dinner itself went well. We complimented each other and even had a few cute moments. I took a photo of himself, and asked how come he didnt yet! He said ""oh yeah"" hesitated and did it for the sake of doing it (you know).

 After that, he wanted to check out a new gay bar. On the way there I joked that if we go, I am not going to hide that I am his partner, like I might kiss him on the cheek. He laughed and asked what that means, and when I said a cheek kiss he responded with a flat “oh” in a cold unimpressed way. That small moment stung because it felt like affection with me is complicated and scarce, but his vibe in other contexts can be casual and open. We still went to the bar, sat for a bit, left, and came back, and the night was not a disaster, but it was another moment where I felt the imbalance sharply.

After that, there were also moments that seemed tender. I apologized to him in bed one night and he held my hand. I spooned him a little in the middle of the night. He no longer always turns away from me in bed like before. But then the next day I came home, went into his room the way we normally do, I asked casually “whooo was showering?” and he snapped “not me” in an irritated tone. I asked if he was okay and he said “yeah” shortly and just kept getting ready to leave for the gym without pausing. It is those whiplash shifts that have been wearing me down.

There was also a small moment that showed how he watches but does not always engage. I edited an inside joke into a text and he noticed even though edits don’t notify, he went back, saw it, and reacted with a laughing emoji. That is sweet in a small way, but it also reinforces that he is aware and present enough to notice details, yet he can still choose silence when it comes to emotional intimacy.

The tension kept building until he said out loud that he was considering breaking up (I had to ask if thats what he wants to get it out of him). That is when I stopped trying to hint or gently circle the issue. I put everything on the table, and I passionately spoke it all from a place of genuine care for this human being.

I told him I am not his enemy. I am not attacking him or judging him. I am his teammate. I want what is best for him and for us. But I cannot keep carrying everything alone and pretending it is fine.
I started by taking accountability for my isolation during the beginning of the genocide. Part of it was trauma. I genuinely did not know how to process watching my people suffer while continuing normal life. I witnessed people dying on live, people I had spoken to days before their martyrdom. I connected with queer Palestinians who were being blackmailed for survival. It was too much. I told him I am not designed to absorb that without consequences. He was merely allowing me the space to go through this but wasnt really by my side, engaged and protective, even when he knew I could be in danger due to my involvement in politics.

But I also admitted something else. Part of my isolation was me unconsciously mimicking his love language's level of intensity?. He communicates very little and tends to express love through quiet acts of service. So I pulled back verbally and emotionally while still maintaining reciprocal acts of service. I also intentionally stopped initiating as much because I realized I had been carrying most of the relationship, and it became too much to do that while also surviving the genocide psychologically in the U.S. with little support.

 I hoped that if I stepped back, he would step forward and carry some weight. I now understand that instead of balancing things, it made him feel shut out and pushed him away. That was not my intention. I apologized for the impact and told him I will not do that again now that I understand it, and I reminded him that when I say I won’t repeat something, I mean it.

Then I explained how alone I have felt in the relationship dynamic for a long time. I am usually the initiator. I call restaurants because he avoids communication. I ask to change tables. I plan birthdays. I plan hangouts. I initiate conversations. I initiate sex. I initiate hard discussions about politics. I told him I do not resent being proactive because I love taking care of people and especially him, but I wanted something like that back. I also told him I have adapted because I know he is not a nonchalant jerk, he truly struggles with communication, but adaptation is not the same as being carried.

One of the hardest parts for me to admit was that I can tell when he isn’t being fully honest even when he uses the hand gesture we established early in the relationship to signal seriousness and truth. That gesture was supposed to be an anchor. But over time I started noticing that sometimes the gesture would be there and something in his eyes would not match. The timing would be off. The energy would feel guarded. I would feel hesitation before the words landed. It is not about catching him in a dramatic lie. It is about sensing withholding, minimizing, or smoothing over something he is not ready to say. In those moments I have two options. I can press him and risk pushing him away, or I can accept what he says and carry the weight of knowing there is more underneath. Most of the time I chose to believe him because I did not want to become interrogative or controlling, but over time that gap erodes trust.

I asked him directly about the timeline pattern I have noticed. Around three to four years seems to be when his relationships start to unravel. I did not say it as an accusation. I asked it as pattern recognition. I asked if this is the stage where he starts emotionally withdrawing instead of addressing what needs repair. I asked if his past partners felt the same loneliness around communication. He admitted communication had been an issue before. I told him I am not afraid of hard seasons. I am afraid of unexamined cycles. If there is a pattern, it deserves to be confronted consciously instead of replayed unconsciously. I am not trying to trap him. I think he views commitment as restrictive. I am trying to see if he is willing to break patterns instead of repeat them, because growth at this stage of life has to be intentional if we want something long term.

I also told him about the imbalance that hurts me. I only hear “I love you” back after I say it first, but he seems comfortable leaving “hot,” “sexy,” and fire emojis on other men’s posts. Flirting outward looks easy and abundant, while affection inward feels scarce. That contrast makes me feel unchosen, even if he insists he cares.
I brought up painful moments that were never properly processed because of his avoidance. There was a song he sent me once that felt like one of the rare moments he expressed feelings through lyrics. I told him I have not listened to it more than twice on purpose because I do not want to memorize it. I want to be able to return to it and feel it fresh, like hearing his vulnerability for the first time again. That might sound dramatic, but for me it symbolizes how rare open expression can feel, and how carefully I hold those moments because they are not frequent.
I brought up that his friend Riley (F, 31) sexually assaulted me at the club and bit my ear. I went to get the CCTV footage. I went to the police station and almost filed a report. In therapy I realized part of my urgency was wanting him to react and protect me. Instead he had private conversations with her and her husband without me. I asked him how he thinks that made me feel, especially knowing he can talk to friends about what happened to me, but cannot sit with me and process it directly.

I brought up the breakfast with his friends where we were joking about things our parents say. I shared that my mom calling me her favorite puts pressure on me. He casually said “that’s why you left her.” The table went silent. Even his friends looked uncomfortable. I didn’t make a scene. I texted “wow” under the table because I was too hurt to speak. I cried privately. Later he broke down and apologized deeply, crying on the floor. I forgave him because I saw genuine shame and fear of saying the wrong thing, but the moment stayed with me as proof that communication wounds can happen without him realizing it, and then I am left carrying the injury alone until it finally surfaces.

I reminded him of waking up from nightmares of decapitated children in Gaza, crying in his arms, washing my face, and putting on a suit to attend his friend Julia’s wedding because it mattered to him that I show up. I reminded him of Lady Land, where I waited over three hours for him, he arrived extremely drunk, couldn’t find the entrance, got mad at me, and I ended up taking him home because he could barely stand. On the subway a homeless man almost attacked him, and I froze thinking I might have to physically intervene while he was incapacitated, and I felt helpless and small. We never processed it. I never got a real “I appreciate you, I see what you did, I’m sorry.” It was always a fleeting sorry followed by a redirect to something lighter like coffee or video games.

I brought up Max (his 9 year old nephew who's going to be under his care in the future) because it is not just about us. When Max started saying the N word, he avoided having the conversation. I asked him how he plans to navigate bigger talks when Max becomes a teenager, talks about sex, drugs, racism, bullying, identity. Avoiding hard talks does not make them disappear. It just passes the responsibility elsewhere. I was not attacking him as an uncle. I was pointing out that communication avoidance shows up across his life, not only with me.
I brought up that he wanted sexual experimentation, so I initiated and planned a foursome for us. He attended but did not converse with the people, did not share likes, dislikes, or boundaries, and left it to me to handle. He did not thank me. I brought up that he did not confront our roommate for using his bed for something sexually invasive, the same bed we sleep on, and when I finally confronted her, he said he probably should mention it too.
I brought up two examples that illustrate the same avoidance pattern. When he learned his biological father is alive, I asked if he had thought about reaching out, he said he never thought about it. When I asked if he had considered exploring medical options for his non hearing ear, especially since he loves music and loud spaces overwhelm him and ruin nights out, he said he never thought about it. The issue was not the specific answers. It was the pattern of not thinking about life and growth steps at all. I told him I do not want to force him into anything. My role is to encourage and support. But life cannot be lived entirely in avoidance. Growth requires initiative from within.

I told him I do not need perfection. I need presence. I need to hear “I see you,” “thank you,” and “I am sorry” when it matters. I reminded him he did not check on me when Netanyahu visited our city, even though politics directly impact my identity and family. I told him I started cooking more because he gets hangry, I bought cute containers to pack his meals, and I had to shyly ask him to wash dishes because I cannot cook and clean alone. I rarely hear appreciation. I brought up that his friend Kelly kicked me out and he did not mediate or defend me.

I also told him directly that I am not stupid. I see him texting his friends about our relationship while refraining from talking to me. I told him I reached out to his friends not to manipulate, but because I was desperate to know what is going on in my partner’s mind when he refuses to tell me. I told him I have learned to translate his feelings through behavior and body language because I cannot rely on words, and that is exhausting.

I also confronted the “static” narrative. He says he feels in stasis. I told him gently that the world is not static, life is not static, I am not static, and the relationship is not static. What is static is his internal avoidance, and it is not about the partners, it is about him. If every relationship becomes “stasis” at the same stage, then the common denominator is the pattern, not the person he is with.

He eventually broke down crying. He apologized and said it seems like he shut me out worse than I shut him out. He said “you kept trying and trying and I gave you nothing back.” I stopped him and told him that is not true. He did give things, he married me, he has shown up politically, he has confronted family at times, and I do see him trying, which is why I still believe he is capable of growth. But I told him I cannot carry this alone, it has to come from him.

After that conversation, the next day I checked in with him, not for an answer, just to see if he was okay. He initially thought I was demanding a decision and got irritated. I clarified that I was just checking because I love him and care, like did you eat, are you okay, do you want to talk before I leave. He softened, smiled, and we hugged.


Then last night happened. He bought dinner, I lay next to him, things felt normal, even soft. I showed him a funny video while he was getting ready for bed. He asked me something from across the room while the video was still loud. I didn’t hear him because I was trying to pause it. It took a couple taps. By the time it stopped, he was repeating his question angrily because he thought I was ignoring him. I was shocked. I asked if he would rather I sleep in my room, and he said “does it matter?” in an angry distant tone.

That question hit me harder than the misunderstanding. It wasn’t about the video. It was about whether my presence matters. I left to calm down, then texted explaining I genuinely couldn’t hear him, and that I wasn’t ignoring him. He apologized and said he doesn’t know why feeling ignored triggers him, especially since he mumbles and was far away. I reassured him I would never deliberately ignore him and I told him it does matter to me.

And on top of all this, there is the Valentine’s detail that pushed me over emotionally. He bought underwear, the same brand he usually gifts me during Valentines. The bag had hearts on it. He hesitated to give it to me, then returned it. When I confronted him, he said “it wasn’t a Valentine’s bag, it was just a [brand's name] bag but they put hearts on it.” I had already thanked him for thinking of me. It is not about the bag. It is about the retreat and then the minimization. If he said “I bought it and panicked,” I would have been hurt but grounded. Instead it felt like he rewrote the meaning to avoid owning the hesitation.

Maybe unnecessary details: it hurts in a way I don’t even know how to articulate to watch our roommate, (Trans White Woman, 30), who started as my friend, use the pet names I came up with for him, rub her cheek against his beard, hug him freely, and be met with warmth and ease, while I feel like I am rationed affection. I was struggling to even get an “I love you” back without initiating it first and now I get nothing back. The contrast is painful. It makes me feel displaced in my own relationship. I realize my isolation also made it seem like I abandoned her, but this feels like punishment when my isolation was a safety measure in a place foreign to me (geographically). There was also the day I found her dilating on his bed (she is trans), the same bed we sleep in and are intimate in. I asked him to set that boundary with her because it made me uncomfortable. He never did. I ended up telling her myself, and she apologized to me. I was left once again handling something that should have been his responsibility. And tonight, after minimizing the Valentine’s underwear and making me feel like I was overinterpreting something meaningful, he went out dancing with her while I stayed home crying. That juxtaposition is what cuts the deepest. It is not just about jealousy. It is about watching him show ease, playfulness, and social energy outward while I feel emotionally starved inward.

This is where I am now. The relationship is not explosive, it is tender and fragile and confusing. There is care, there are moments of softness, there are apologies. But there is also chronic avoidance and inconsistency that makes me feel alone, and I am starting to feel like whatever I do irritates him, and sometimes I wonder if he wants me to initiate leaving so he doesn’t have to be the one to end it.

When I imagine five more years of this pattern, my body tightens. I am not asking if he is evil. I am asking if this is emotional avoidance that can change with therapy and real effort, or if this is a fundamental mismatch where I over function and he under functions, and I will slowly shrink trying to keep the relationship alive.
I dont know what I need, I honestly just feel alone and gaslit and guilty and misunderstood and punished all at the same time and I'm scared being in this place we share all alone without family here..

I guess the only good thing that came out of this is how comfortably I talked to my sister about this for an advice and some support she generously gave, despite not understanding my sexual orientation. It brought us closer and I always dreamed of leaning on my sister when it comes to my love life so.. ♡",1,1771483591.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

As the title says, I’m looking for the best neighborhood in Halifax. I’ll be moving there soon and would love your opinions!

In my view, a ""good"" neighborhood is close enough to downtown to be reachable by foot or public transit (10-15 min), with plenty of coffee shops, local boutiques, good restaurants, libraries, and parks.

I lived in Ottawa for 3 years and Montreal for 1.5 years. My favorite spots were:

Ottawa: Little Italy and the Glebe.

Montreal: Outremont, Plateau, Rosemont, Little Italy, and the Laurier avenue area.

I know I shouldn’t expect the exact same vibe as Montreal or Ottawa, but I’m eager to get to know the city. I don’t really see myself living right downtown; I’d much prefer being part of a real community.

Or it’s preferable to live in downtown like a newcomer ? 

Thanks for your help!

Also if you have a good recommendation of A descent rent in this neighborhood I’m way more interested!

Thank you in advance !",0,1771483109.0,halifax,0,0.5,False

1r8s0na,https://v.redd.it/05zby3gncekg1,Corridor 7 Coffee roasters,"Visited C7 in Nagpur this weekend. Visited two of their branches one at Bardi and this one at DharamPeth. Karan gave me a walk through of the roasting process there while my Gungegeri Estate coffee beans were being roasted. 

One thing i loved about Nagpur was that people really knew and appreciated their coffee. It was nothing like StarBucks crowd, people actually knew what they were having and what it should taste like. 

I enjoyed two cups in Bardi and followed by another two cups here n cherished the whole experience. ",24,1771483106.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False

I got out there, just to prove to myself that there might be another fit and it’s not all bad.

YOU GUYS. I went on a date with this incredible guy:

\-I was late. The cafe we were going to go to was closed that day- he wasn’t even remotely upset with me, and said, ok, lead the way, where are we going now? (you have no idea how much this meant to me-my last partner would freak out every time a tiny little thing went wrong and it would ruin the entire date. potentially even the weekend.)

\-Full belly laughs, haven’t laughed that long and hard with someone in a longgg time. so sharp and witty and funny

\-He was a perfect gentleman- he drove to my part of town, held open the door for me multiple times. since he had to go farther, i offered to pay for the coffee- he fought me and bought it for me??? he even offered to drive me closer to my house so i didn’t have to walk since he knew i walked there. he texted me that he had a wonderful date and that he wanted to see me again

\- been single for several years and can talk about his ex without animosity- was totally matter of fact about her and didn’t go on forever

\- independent- has a life, friends, a steady job he’s good at and likes well enough, hobbies, a handle on his mental health, goals and dreams, a studio apartment, a car OMG!!!

\-emotionally intelligent- he could read exactly how i was feeling and i could read exactly how he was feeling. we just knew- i didn’t have to sit there and guess. conversation was easy and we both put in equal work to keep it flowing

\-THE BEST PART: we both kept getting distracted by all the animals nearby- just the best dogs and birds and animals ever out because it was sunny. (he had a picture of his family’s dogs on his credit card too OMG.) there was a lady who put her dog on a post outside so she could run in and go order some food- but he noticed she got loose. he called her over, and the dog immediately came running over and cuddled with him and got all the pets. he kept the dog from wandering off or running out into the middle of the street until the woman could come back. when she came back, she was so apologetic and he went “oh no, it’s no problem! she’s such a good girl :) “ and he was just so aggressively kind to the cashier working the register- AJDGDKFHKFHDJRJF!!!!!

I haven’t felt this sexy in years. I haven’t been this attracted to someone in years. BRB buying new cute underwear holy hell

I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop- something must be wrong. He must secretly be an asshole. We don’t align with kids or religion, but I’m not necessarily looking for a husband. Just someone who feels nice in the moment and is fun on dates. Either way- this is too good to be true!",5,1771483032.0,dating,3,0.78,False
1r8rz3z,https://i.redd.it/cei8bjwbcekg1.jpeg,What’s one place in Vietnam that feels better solo than with friends?,"I’ve been thinking about how different Vietnam feels depending on who you’re traveling with. Some places are amazing with a group, loud dinners, shared motorbike rides, chaotic fun. But I’ve also noticed there are certain spots that just hit differently when you’re alone. For me, sitting at a quiet café in Da Lat with the fog rolling in felt way more meaningful solo. No pressure to talk. No need to coordinate plans. Just me, a cup of coffee, and time slowing down a bit. What’s that place for you in Vietnam? A beach? A mountain town? A random alley in Hanoi?",2,1771482957.0,solotravelVN,4,0.75,False
