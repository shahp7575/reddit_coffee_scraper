1p9fd2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1p9fd2k/help_im_having_a_gay_crisis/,HELP! I’m having a gay crisis!,"I have made a new friend, but I don’t know if it’s a moving to something closer or not.  She is bi. 
She calls me queen all the time, but never hear her call anyone else that. 

We have one class together and have been class friends since the beginning. On Halloween she says, “YOU’RE HERE. I thought you weren’t.” I was right on time. On the 2nd,  I tell my roommate that I might like her little. 
Monday, the 3rd, the prof brings donuts and I can’t have any because of my celiac. She can’t eat in front of many people because she had a root canal 2 weeks before. She gets one but doesn’t eat it. On our way out, she asked why I didn’t get one and I told her it was from celiac. She said oh I get it I didn’t want to eat it in front of everyone because I get food messy because I can’t eat with my front teeth. You should try the new gluten free place in pullman square. Once we get off the elevator, she said, “you should try it. No, we should go there sometime. We should hang out. What’s your Snap?” Nothing happened the next week ish 
The following Monday, she says she is talking to a guy, but isn’t sure about him. 
Wednesday, I said something about a character, she laughs. We are meant to work with a partner. She asks if I like her nails. I said yes. She aggressively points at the chair next to her. She turns to the computer while saying, “let’s get this done, baby.” We had a conversation of how my brother sucks. I say I can’t see the screen. She proceeds to make the screen brighter and larger. When I had to leave early, I said peace out. She said bye really sadly.
That night, I take her up on that offer of hanging out. We agree on coffee on Friday morning before class. We would meet in easy lobby.
I ask her if she thought I could read 3 books during break. The roommate thinks I can’t. She said, “ I think you can. You got this queen.”
Friday, when I get off the elevator, she talking to someone on the phone, says, “I like 2 people, but one a little bit more.” As she is looking at me. Asked me if I was okay after I was quiet (it was 8 in the morning). I said I was having brain fog because meds hadn’t kicked in yet. Then she asked my age. My dumb ass said 17 even though I’m 19. She says, “17?” I’m like no I’m 19 but my birthday is at the end of august. She said hers is too and what day. We share the same birthday. She takes me to the student government office to drop off shoes. We went up the stairs. I have POTS and my heart rate was 160 and I could feel it. She said you good as I’m checking my watch. Told me to sit my ass down. When it got better she said, “do you want coffee?” I said we can. She said, “ I didn’t say we could, I said do YOU want some.” She then asks how many dining dollars I have and said she would pay for it. Once we got to class, she sits 2 seats closer to me since no one is there. Later, I say she looked nice and we should hang out another time. 
We talk a little over the weekend. Monday nothing happens. Tuesday, me, my roommate, and a gay guy friend was watching Wicked. I send a snap of the friend saying, “when you die, I will be there to watch them dump you in the ground, BITCH. We are aggressive to each other. An hour after, she sends, “ WHY IS THERE A MAN IN YOUR ROOM? WHO IS THIS MAN?” I say it’s my gay friend and he is the one that calls me bitch 24/7. She said, “oh, okay.” I say, “okay?” She said, “I get worried when a man is in a woman’s room.” We go on. That evening, she asks if I would like to hang out before break. I said sure when. We end up settling with Wednesday at her dorm to watch her favorite show. 
Wednesday, in class she asks if we were still good with that night. I said yes. Later in the day, she forgot she had a club meeting, but we can still meet up. She said she is excited to hang out. I said I was too. Around 6, we get to her dorm. I was standing there. She is a little more aggressive than normal.She said her house is my house. She said I don’t have to be scared i can get on the bed. She leaves me fully alone in the room, but if I was comfortable before she left. When she got back, she jumps on the bed. Her roommate said something along the lines of if you’re cold you should cuddle under the blanket. I didn’t hear it fully, but she didn’t at all. Her roommate starts laughing at looking at me. We start watching the show. She starts saying how 2 people are hot (guy and girl). I show her Sadie Sink because she is my crush. She starts taking about the guy. He is always saying what she says is wrong and she thinks he thinks she is dumb. He left her on delivered for 13 hours. She asks me and the roommate should she break things off with him. I didn’t say anything. She is looking at me and the bed. Her roommate said she should because she could find someone better. She said would do it tomorrow. We went down to the market, she got food. She said if I wanted anything she would pay for it. I said no I’m good, I’m still full from thanksgiving dinner. We continue watching the show and I leave around 10:30. I had been quiet for almost the whole evening. 
The next day, I tell her I had fun and we should hang out again after the semester starts back up. I’m sorry if I seemed a little out of sorts, I have too many things on my mind.  She said it was fine. We snapped almost the whole day about her busy day and I have online classes and have a tutoring and that’s it. 
Friday, we are in the computer lab. I bring the book I’m doing my final on and I didn’t realize until I read it, it was a gay romance. The prof read the back of it and said she seen it. She said, “it’s plain as day, queen.” 2 girls in front us are looking at each other each time we talk.She starts talking about the show she is going to do the final on and how she likes the 2 people on it. I say that she was talking about that the whole time. She puts her head on the table blushing and  looking over at me every now and then. Yet the girls are looking at each other and us. I am off in la la land. She says, “ you need to get back to work, queen.” I said I know but brain says no. 
All this week, we have been talking about our animals, homophobic family, why only my grandma and aunt add the only ones who don’t know I’m gay, periods, and videos of Alex. ",1,1764389652.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

My name is Bella. I’m a 32-year-old living in Central Jersey (yes, it exists, and no, I don't want to argue about it ).

I used to work in healthcare - I loved the fast pace, the patients, and actually using my degree. 

But for the last couple of years, I’ve been a Stay-at-Home Mom to my two little ones while my husband works. Don't get me wrong, I love them more than life itself, but if I have to explain to a toddler one more time why we don't eat rocks, I might scream. 

I feel like I’m losing a bit of me in the process. I’m definitely feeling a little ""touched out"" and isolated lately, and I really miss talking to adults about things that aren’t Barney or potty training.

A bit about me:
• Coffee: It's not a beverage; it's a survival tool. Usually consumed cold three hours after I brewed it.
• Books: Now, I mostly read The Very Hungry Caterpillar, but I’m trying to get back into reading for pleasure before bed (unsuccessfully)
• Vibe: I’m open minded and a good listener.

The wall and ground was pretty simple, the usual mix of joint compound and insulation foam, and the door was made of aged wooden coffee stirrers. 

I had the most fun with the little details, like the tiny shotgun shells, the horse shoe, the barrel leaking rum through a stray bullet hole and the Zapata poster.

1p9faxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1p9faxt/how_badly_am_i_feeding_our_8yo_honestly/,"How badly am I feeding our 8yo, honestly??","How badly am I feeding our 8yo, honestly??

This is pretty long, so TLDR: My partner has serious resentment for how I feed our 8yo son, and I'm not sure how to address them as I feel they're 1. not actually major issues, and 2. As his own feeding habits are as bad or worse in many aspects, so I am in need of brutal honesty to see if I am really out of line.

 For context, I work 1sts and my partner works 3rds so the majority of meals are a solo ordeal for me to acquire/allow/decide/provide, by default. I remind dad that he could certainly prepare and provide more 'adequate' options and meals if he really wanted to, and sometimes he cooks, but it isn't daily, nor generally any better/different than I cook. 

Here are his list of complaints: I treat kiddo to fast food 3-4x a month. He gets a sweet drink (a pop or a slushie) 1-2x a week. He takes a pizza Lunchable + fruit to school for lunch once a week. He eats school lunch most other days (it is a huge fault to not send him with homemade food, according to dad, even though kiddo typically chooses the grilled chicken salad option). He enjoys cereal with milk 1-2x a week for a post-dinner snack. I order pizza for us once a week. His favorite, regular breakfast is a toasted bagel with cream cheese + yogurt + fruit (anything besides eggs and meat brings scorn from dad). Finally, he has baked chicken nuggets 1-2x a week. 

Outside of what is listed, I don't provide many other 'treats' or processed meals, and I feel i cook and feed him pretty well for the other meals. According to my partner, though, this is all literal child abuse.

I have tried to reason with him that none of this is necessarily excessive or bad, and give reasonable comparisons to his own 'bad' feeding behaviors that I could easily, strongly oppose: He buys juice boxes all the time and feels it is ok for our son to have those daily, whereas I don't  buy sweet drinks for the home. He buys a half gallon or two of ice cream, but gets upset if our son eats a small amount more than occasionally (dad will binge most of it overnight so it's not like there's a lot left for kiddo to eat, and I don't even fancy ice cream myself so i don't buy it). Whereas fast food is Satan, It's ok for them to go get Chinese or Tex-Mex or diner food together 2-3x a week; was even more often in past years. 

My son would probably not be able to identify fruits or vegetables if it weren't for me (I insist on either fruit or veggies at nearly every meal) -- his dad thinks meat or eggs + rice/pasta/toast is sufficient to cover all food groups. If i buy a pack of cookies, I am in trouble and our son can only have one a day, max (but similar situation to ice cream where dad eats the whole package himself in 1-2 days). In general, he thinks everything he buys or makes or eats is basically perfect, whereas I should be turned in for what I provide.

 We can even prepare nearly the exact same meal -- for example, Mac and cheese -- yet it seems depending on who made it, that's either wholesome or lazy (but guess who provides a side of veggies to go with it, and who doesn't).

The hardest part is how we see these issues in magnitude. I view dad's food choices as something I can deal with or supplement with healthy options when needed, not the biggest deal at all; just different viewpoints, strengths, and experiences. He views mine as truly bad parenting, plain and simple. 

He tattles to both his family and mine, even his friends, about food, always making me sound like an awful, lazy parent. Even unrelated issues are pulled into this. If our son catches a cold, somehow that is at least secondarily because of what I fed him. 

 He praises his parents for generally always having home-cooked meals as a kid when his mom wasn't  working, yet heavily resents them for allowing him to ever have hot dogs or nachos when they sometimes didn't cook (when she went back to work). It's a weird, sad pedestal that he both places them on AND knocks them off from, depending on the day. 

He even chastises MY food now -- I'm a long-time vegetarian myself. I prepare meals far healthier than most folks I know and prepare/eat fruits and veggies like they're going out of style, but apparently having leftover pizza for my occasional lunch means I'm nutritionally-incompetent, and needing to take ONE dose of meds last week for a mild fever is because I don't take better care of myself. Yet, who has the better daily BMs and vitals? Easy answer there.

When our son had to have some basic oral care work done a couple of years ago, dad joined for ONE appt and put the blame on me for causing with food it SO intensely, we actually had to separate for a while (no mention that I'm the only one who ever worked with kiddo to brush his teeth or floss). Our DDS still gives me sideways looks to this day and I hold my breath at every appt.

I know I am not perfect but I have generally done my best. I breastfed my son for his whole first year and wouldve gone longer but he self-weaned. I made all his baby food homemade. Now, I encourage him to try every new, healthy food we can ever access, including international  foods. I am not a lazy, careless parent, nor am I a rigid nutritionist, so I'm really struggling with how this is presented both in and out of our home. I used to buy snacks and such for home but mostly cut them out to ease tension, with little success. I keep an overflowing fruit basket for better choices. Food is such a touchy topic, and we are so uneasy whenever it comes up. To the point where I (and now kiddo) feel the  need to hide and/or cover up what he's eaten to avoid a fight. We can't even mention enjoying the snacks at coffee hour after church. That breaks my heart and I know from experience that it will affect my son in life, to have a secretive or restricted relationship with food. 

Parades, Easter, and Halloween are now stressful because candy is part of the deal, and that makes me so sad for him that he can't just enjoy these fun things without worrying about what dad will say when we bring home sweets.

I also don't appreciate being denigrated to everyone we know. No one else really sees what we eat as we are pretty isolated, just what is reported by him. His parents, then, think I'm awful by proxy. My family sees things in a more reasonable and nuanced way, thankfully. I do see what other parents feed their kids and i surely don't  think I'm a poor comparison. 

Am I just kidding myself and being too defensive, focused on what I provide that is good and downplaying the bad? It seems cruel to ban sweets and chicken nuggets. Even adults like those. I have a hard time defending myself without it becoming a fight, and maybe I shouldn't? 

Our son is in very good health and spirit! He isn't some obese kid who can't run around and have fun. His doctors have not once mentioned a concern about his diet/nutrition, his weight, etc. So food just seems such a stupid thing to argue about, but I don't want to be in denial, either.

 Not sure if I also should be fighting against dad's bad foods more, or if I'm doing it right with trying to hold space for nuance and flexibility for us both in our choices? 

If I am truly feeding him poorly enough  to warrant such tension, please be honest with  me. Nameless 3rd party advice is so helpful. TYIA",1,1764389473.0,Parenting,2,1.0,False

# Chapter 1: The Subscription Ninja — Silent, Deadly, Always Invisible

Every anime team has a stealth character.  
Silent footsteps.  
Sudden appearances.  
Deadly precision.

https://preview.redd.it/vz2q8o0sc44g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad7098bd158d276c7b6f7f3994019d3b6f5fcfd

In your financial life, this character takes the form of:

* **₹99** video app subscription.
* **₹149** premium filter pack
* **₹59** cloud storage
* **₹300** membership you forgot existed
* “**Free trial** — auto-renews next month!”

The **Subscription Ninja** doesn’t attack loudly.  
It kills your money in **small, quiet cuts.**

# How This Villain Operates

This ninja embraces the power of:

# Shadow Clone Billing

Every month, it multiplies.

What started as one subscription becomes:

* 7 small apps
* 3 streaming services
* 2 memberships
* 5 recurring digital tools you don’t even use anymore

Each clone **charges a tiny fee**—just small enough that you don’t question it.

# Why the Subscription Ninja Is Dangerous

* It **never stops** attacking
* You **forget** it exists
* Your brain ignores **small amounts**
* It blends **perfectly** into monthly expenses
* **Auto-renewal** makes it grow without your permission

By the time you notice, this **ninja has taken thousands** without you even remembering its name.

# Hero Strategy: How to Defeat the Subscription Ninja

* **Perform a Monthly Audit Slash** Go through bank statements once a month.
* **Disable Auto-Renew Everywhere Possible.** Make yourself approve renewals manually.
* **Use Shared Plans Wisely** Anime heroes always form strategic alliances—so should you.
* **Set Alerts for Free Trial End Dates.** A ninja can’t surprise you if you’re already waiting for him.

# Chapter 2: The Cashback Demon — Master of Illusion and Temptation

If you’ve **watched any fantasy anime,** you’ve met a villain who corrupts heroes using **seductive offers**.

That’s exactly what the **Cashback Demon does.**

https://preview.redd.it/779vlpdkd44g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f580af9d563d2fb2569c9dcaf5e8bae76fd92cc

It promises:

* “Spend **₹500**, get **₹50** back!”
* “Earn **10%** rewards!”
* “Buy this, get instant cashback!”

Sounds like a blessing, right?

But the demon’s real power lies in **making you believe you saved money when you actually spent more.**

# The Cashback Demon’s Ability: Mirage of Savings

Just like a desert illusion, cashback looks like a reward…

But often:

* It only applies if you **spend MORE.**
* It expires quickly.
* It pushes you to **buy things** you didn’t need.
* It nudges you to **purchase** from specific brands.
* You forgot to redeem it.

Cashback is rarely free money.  
It’s a spell designed to control your spending.

# Why This Villain Is Dangerous

* It uses positive **reinforcement** to shape expensive habits
* Makes a **₹2,000** unnecessary purchase feel “smart”
* Rewards **impulsive** buying
* Creates a dependency loop

# How to Defeat the Cashback Demon

**Develop awareness**  
Before buying anything, ask:  
***“Would I buy this without the cashback?”***

**Use cashback ONLY on essential expenses**  
Groceries. Fuel. Bills.

**Never buy something** ***because*** **of cashback**  
The demon feeds on impulsive decisions.

Every anime has a charismatic, **intelligent, manipulative villain** who’s calm even in chaos.

https://preview.redd.it/atwbm3tpd44g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=936b2a32333ee97bfca0a7abeef4b9f96cc723ed

That’s your **Credit Card Overlord**.

Polished. Sophisticated.  
Charming. Deceptive.  
Useful… yet extremely dangerous.

# What This Villain Promises

* **Buy now, pay later**
* **Zero interest for X months**
* **Reward points**
* **Lounge access**
* **Cashbacks**
* **Discounts**

Sounds like a **kingdom of privilege**, right?

Until you see what happens behind the throne.

# The Overlord’s True Power: The Compound Curse

If you carry a balance…  
If you miss a payment…  
If you pay only the minimum…

You get hit by:

* **25–36% interest**
* **Late penalties**
* **Interest-on-interest**
* **Additional charges hidden in fine print**

The debt grows like a **monster evolving** through its forms.

# Why The Overlord Is Dangerous

* Makes spending feel painless
* Encourages lifestyle inflation
* Keeps you trapped in debt cycles
* A single mistake can cost months of savings

# How to Defeat This Villain

* **Pay your full balance every month.** Minimum payment = eternal debt loop.
* **Lower the credit limit.** Heroes limit their own power to prevent self-destruction.
* **Turn on auto-pay.** No more late fees.
* **Treat your credit card like a debit card.** Don’t spend money you don’t have.

# Chapter 4: The Lifestyle Upgrade Beast — The Shape-Shifting Temptation Monster

This villain evolves with you.  
It grows stronger as **YOUR income** grows stronger.

https://preview.redd.it/i2ksctbxd44g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=93287dc69067fefd895d0e891b8dc27a4ee64005

Just like anime power escalation, the **Lifestyle Upgrade Beast** transforms when:

* You get a raise
* You switch to a better job
* You start earning more
* You receive a bonus

Suddenly, your old phone “doesn’t feel right.”  
**Your bike feels too basic.**  
**Your clothes feel outdated.**

The Beast whispers:

“You deserve better.”

And you do!  
But not at the **cost of sacrificing** your future wealth.

# Why This Villain Is Dangerous

* Expenses increase faster than income
* Savings don’t grow
* Lifestyle becomes unaffordable
* You feel poor despite earning more
* You develop spending guilt

# The Beast’s Power: Evolving Wants

Yesterday’s luxury becomes today’s necessity.

And tomorrow’s **necessity becomes** next week’s compulsion.

# Hero Strategy: Defeating the Lifestyle Beast

* **The 30-Day Rule:** Wait 30 days before any major purchase.
* **Focus on Value, Not Image** Ask: “Does this make my life better or just look better?”
* **Increase Savings Before Lifestyle** Always upgrade income → then savings → THEN lifestyle.

# Chapter 5: The EMI Phantom — The Invisible Shackles on Your Future

This is the ghost you never notice until it’s too late.

https://preview.redd.it/ye61kqx1e44g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=60256a9f92eba8004ab51feedbbf4f3e4055ec58

The EMI Phantom starts small:

* **“Only ₹500 per month!”**
* **“No cost EMI!”**
* **“Convenient monthly payments!”**

But as with every **horror anime spirit**, the danger lies in its invisibility.

# The Phantom’s Power: Fragmented Debt Fog

By breaking down the price, it **tricks your brain** into thinking it’s affordable.

But too many EMIs trap you into:

* Constant repayment cycles
* No savings
* No flexibility
* Income stress
* Financial dependency

# Why This Villain Is Dangerous

* Locks **your future** income
* Makes your **monthly budget** suffocating
* Turns small purchases into **long-term obligations**
* A job loss or an **emergency** becomes disastrous

# How to Defeat the EMI Phantom

* Only use EMIs for: *home, education, business equipment*
* Avoid EMIs for: phones, holidays, gadgets, clothes, lifestyle upgrades
* Build an emergency fund before taking ANY EMI

# Chapter 6: The Discount Dragon — The Master of Urgency and FOMO Flames

This majestic, **fiery beast dominates festival seasons,** online marketplaces, and midnight sales.

https://preview.redd.it/3isrrn47e44g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=231fd5765880c2bb071ed8018ca64625d5d49fca

The Discount Dragon uses powerful techniques:

* Lightning Deals
* Flash Sales
* Limited Stock
* “Today only!”
* “Buy 1 Get 1!”
* Festival FOMO

The Dragon’s fire isn’t literal—it’s psychological.

# Its Special Move: The FOMO Flame Burst

It burns your logic using fear:

* ***Fear of missing out***
* **Fear of losing a “great deal”**
* **Fear that the item won’t come back**
* **Fear that you’ll regret not buying**

And so you buy things you:

* don’t need
* won’t use
* forget within a week

# Why This Villain Is Dangerous

* Turns rational buyers into impulsive shoppers
* Creates clutter
* Encourages emotional spending
* Wastes money meant for real goals

# How to Slay the Discount Dragon

* Make a shopping list BEFORE entering a sale
* Stick to a fixed budget
* Ask yourself: ***“Would I buy this at full price?”***
* Compare prices outside the sale

# Chapter 7: The Peer Pressure Puppeteer — The Social Manipulator

This villain uses **social strings** to control your actions.

https://preview.redd.it/6np7kg1be44g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=94b6babae32f0d0a6c54ed658a824d2b3531a51a

It whispers:

* “Everyone’s buying it…”
* “Come on, don’t be cheap…”
* “Live a little…”
* “Why aren’t you spending like the rest?”

Peer pressure is one of the strongest forces in human behaviour, and the Puppeteer knows exactly how to manipulate it.

# Why This Villain Is Dangerous

* **Makes you spend money to impress others**
* **Pushes you into buying things outside your budget**
* **Creates emotional guilt when you say “no”**
* **Prevents you from sticking to financial goals**

# Hero Strategy: Cutting the Strings

* Learn to say **“no”** politely but firmly
* Tell people your priorities—**nothing** to be ashamed of
* Build confidence in your own **financial path**
* **Remember:** no one else will pay your bills

# Chapter 8: The Tiny Expenses Titan — The Giant Built from Pennies

This titan doesn’t attack with massive blows.

https://preview.redd.it/nlfg7qzee44g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=399c12af30538e1e966730ca27522586e95331ed

It attacks slowly…

Using:

* ₹50 snacks
* ₹99 add-ons
* ₹20 treats
* ₹80 coffee
* ₹150 deliveries
* ₹5 here, ₹10 there

One small purchase won’t hurt you.  
But thousands of tiny purchases form a financial titan that crushes your savings.

# The Titan’s Power: Accumulation of Micro-Expenses

**₹100/day seems small, but:**

**₹100/day → ₹3,000/month → ₹36,000/year**

And that’s just **ONE habit.**

# How to Defeat the Titan?

* Track daily expenses
* Identify your top money leaks
* Replace costly habits with cheaper alternatives
* Set weekly limits for “small treats”

# Chapter 9: The Impulsive Buying Berserker — The Emotion Monster

This villain is **chaotic, uncontrollable**, and fueled by emotions.

https://preview.redd.it/4pu6dfpje44g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d8a097289448505a23e7d690bec1e65cb04c2a6

It attacks when you’re:

* bored
* sad
* stressed
* excited
* angry
* lonely

Impulsive buying feels good for a few minutes—but the Berserker’s attacks leave regret behind.

# Why This Villain Is Dangerous?

* **Clouds your decision-making**
* **Causes unnecessary spending**
* **Leads to post-purchase guilt**
* **Makes financial planning impossible**

# How to Control the Berserker?

* Pause for **10 seconds** before buying
* Understand what **emotion** is pushing you
* Replace emotional buying with **healthy habits**
* Wait **24 hours** before non-essential purchases

# Final Chapter: Your Hero Awakening — Becoming the Protagonist of Your Financial Anime

Every anime **protagonist starts confused, weak,** or unaware of their true power.

https://preview.redd.it/gu19gzfoe44g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c81d4e409eb698d6e2dae1f4b74358f26a28a0f2

But what makes them heroes is:

* awareness
* discipline
* training
* consistency
* courage
* clarity
* the willingness to grow

Your financial journey is exactly like that.

You will face:

* **setbacks**
* **mistakes**
* **temptations**
* **pressure**
* **villains**

But you will also gain:

* **knowledge**
* **strategy**
* **resilience**
* **confidence**
* **control**
* **freedom**

I miss you so much! The holidays are not the same without you. I look at the dining room table and you are not there. I visualize you sitting with your big round glasses, reading a magazine, and drinking the coffee I made you. I miss the small talk we would have while I prepared the holiday meal. In the back ground I can hear the football game going and the chatter of the kids and Theo. Now one kid is left and the room is more silent. Mom the cell phones have taken over we no longer engage one another like we did when I was growing up. No sounds of the dominos clicking as we played the game forty-two, the dice are not rolling as we played Yahtzee. I can still hear the sound the dice made when they rolled across the card table.
 
I buy a monopoly game thinking we could play even though I hate the game. This board game will be shuffled off to another home for others to play. I’m told it takes too long to play and there is no time. I try to find another game but it’s a disappointment and too stupid to play so I don’t even try. Mom, I don’t expect too much do I? I love cooking for the holidays and doing for others, but I need to have fun too. I want to be included instead of alone in the kitchen. Someone for me to make coffee for and visit, taste the food to make sure it is seasoned right.
 
Social media is a safe place for people to be because they don’t have to think or engage with others. The cell phones are dumbing us down. I long for a time when things were much simpler.
Mom people would think I am being a baby just whining about my problems. I was told I need to by bar stools to put in the kitchen may be that would help family to engage more but I’m afraid they would sit empty. I don’t know how to feel heard without upsetting everyone.

**Here’s a few scenarios…**

-She does everything she can to act like she’s not into me when co workers tease her about me. When I dropped her off home I actually don’t feel she has any feelings for me compared to at work 

 -she’s told me im “handsome” 4 times?

**Last Saturday she weirdly messaged me at 10pm “What I’m doing “ then called at 11:30pm. I was asleep the whole time. Suddenly the next day she was absent from work for the first time in 2 years…claims she’s accidentally miscalled but i saw my phone ringing for ages”** maybe drunk and needed a ride home?

-Playfully punches me 

-At work she’s whispered in my ear “let’s go on break together without saying anything”, told me to fix her hair, often stations herself so she’s next to me, she does these things when people aren’t watching..

-her lift home was absent for a few days so she asked me to drop her off home saying “ its our secret don’t tell anyone else” she wanted to stop to buy some groceries (red flag right, am I being used”? when I told her I told someone I dropped her off home she got really shy , laughing / but paranoid about it.  There’s literally other people like woman she’s close too that she could ask to drop her off home to avoid gossip but she still chooses me in this secret manner 

Other than that time she had no lift shes never asked me for any favours…and offered to bring me food for work

-When dropping her off she’s also planned to go random places like eat somewhere or mall but got tired and just asked me to take her home instead

-The next week she told me quietly  “I miss you dropping me off I enjoy it it’s our secret “She never wants me to drop her off at her house only across the highway so no one sees…(dunno if she’s married!!??) but has claimed the entire time to me she’s single 

-I asked her this week why she didn’t get any sleep and she said “Im thinking of you”  giggling then said jk 

-She always messages me first not me. Our convos are really short and basic like 3 sentences. But now shes suddenly calling me..shes not really good at typing English 

-She also asked me where I was on break one time cause I was at a different cafeteria and all of a sudden the next day she walked all the way there only because I was there and even told me this …

-This week she was asking what my parents house looks like then I asked “Do you want to come to my house lol” then she said “No….”

-she said she has a cousin she will introduce me to Thats looking for a bf and to add her as a friend, she asked me if I have a gf” i said no and she said “We will talk about it later” all of a sudden she never talked about it again lol??

- one time I saw her recording me on her phone then she suddenly flipped the camera and acted like she was fixing her hair

I’ve wanted to live in Seattle for the past 10-15 years of my life (26F). I’ve visited enough to know the climate, etc. and that it is truly somewhere i want to live at least for a while. The surrounding nature is the big draw for me, however I do romanticize the idea of living downtown / shopping at a market / hopefully having more of a social life than I do now.

rentals currently seem to be cheaper as opposed to previous years and places I’ve lived previously + currently, and I’m ready to make the move I think.

Looking into studio apartments + co living spaces. Any recommendations, advice, specific complexes, and anything to stay away from - is welcome. Priority is safety, socializing ability, location (neighborhood in downtown area with whatever cool gentrified coffee shops / dive bars / unique spots).

I have a cat, and I’m in the music industry so I travel most of the year touring. So a small space is fine for me. Not super open to a bedroom, as I need at least a private bath and kitchenette so I can isolate if needed.

  
Lay it on thick and give me any honest thoughts on where I should look, likelihood of me forming a social circle, and anything I should steer clear of.

Entry 8 

August 31^(st). 

“Can you stop reading that GOD awful self-help book already!” The gambler blurted out, directed at the African American man. “I’m so tired of hearing about it all!” 

“Let me read in peace please” was his response.  

“Constant! Louder and louder! Your terrible books, the girl's stupid home, the woman's annoying family!” the gambler pointed a moving excusatory finger at each of them “I’ve had enough! And don’t even get me started on this senile old man, always thinking about the stupid fucking sunflowers!” His anger now directed at the most fragile one in the group. The Singaporean sat at the table, staring at nothing. Some more yelling was done before he struck the innocent man, nothing too harsh, just a smack behind the head. We called security to calm the situation down. 

This is how the conflicts began, or something like this anyway. The point is the old man shut down mentally and refused to speak. We did multiple checks on the man, and he was physically healthy, but something wasn’t right mentally. We couldn't get in contact with any of his family, so he stayed in our care. The gambler kept starting fights, nothing extreme, but eventually causing security to step in every now and then. The large dark man that once stood tall and confident had shrunk to a mouse that only read. The two women in the room were inseparable. They huddled together constantly and sometimes whispered reassurance to each other. Clearly these people were miserable, and the effects of whatever happened to them were causing complications. And yet they stayed. Some refused the idea of leaving, the gambler for one kept raving about getting his money, some just seemed to stay because the others did. We kept them there and watched them.  

The morale in the office wasn’t good. At work and in our quarters, we were often silent, lost in our work or our own thoughts. Sometimes me and Craig would confine in each other, questioning our life choices, sometimes laughing about it. I believe the girls did the same thing. Sometimes I’d talk to Gabriella. Sweet conversations about our innocent youths.  

“As I said, I was always a science nerd, so it makes sense I ended up in a place like this. But you? How does a sporty outdoors man like yourself wind up in this spot? I mean, what happened to all the camping and rock climbing you spoke so fondly of?” She asked with a giggle. That kind of positivity hadn’t been seen in these rooms for a long time. 

“Oh, come on. That was a lifetime ago.” I responded. 

“College was a lifetime ago? It feels like yesterday for me. How old are you Mr. Miller?”  

I was so caught up with her soft sweetness I had forgotten of our age gap. The realization admittedly shocked me; I paused while taking a sip of my coffee. 

“I’m sorry Mr. Miller, how rude of me.” She said, face blushed bright pink. 

“No, no. It’s alright. I’m 50.” If I had to say a guess of her age, I'd say Gabreilla was around early 30’s. If I was willing to admit I stalked her file, I’d say she was exactly 28 as of 5 months ago. Believe it or not watching crazy people all day every day gets boring so sometimes you gotta fill the gaps between disturbing incidents with finding out the details of your coworkers. Don't judge me. Anyway, after that the joyful conversation turned awkward, so she returned to her work, and I returned to my second cup of coffee. 

 To be honest, I think we were scared, although we didn’t admit it. Scared for these people and for ourselves. We would try to busy ourselves with work and idle conversation, but at one point or another we aways had to come back and address the elephant in the room. This is roughly when my nightmares started, so even in sleep, I could not rest. 

I would dream of them. They took me to a shore in the middle of the night, strange moons hung above. They were talking to me all at once, different things but occasionally their sentences would align in a few words or phrases. They blamed me. For their situations, before the experiment, and after. Somehow it was all my fault. They'd surround me and the noise would strain my ears even if I tried to cover them.  Eventually the stress and pressure would wake me up. We all had nightmares from time to time, us and the subjects. It was normal.

Entry 9 

I saw her outside my window two nights ago.  

I collapsed on the ground at who knows what time, not asleep but not awake. My knees just seemed to have given up just as much as I had. It’d be hypocritical of me to force them up and continue my binge drinking into the night. So, on the floor I stayed. Until a sobering knock had risen me from my state. Just one swift knock, not even at my door, I don’t know where it came from. I steadied myself, eyes darting around the dimly lit space, the air thick with the stench of alcohol. I stood in the center of my room and listened, liquid confidence preparing me to strike at anything, hands open and at the ready, like a drunken fool. The knock was sharp, deliberate, and it still echoed in my mind, as if it had come from all around me. I couldn’t place it. Not the door, not the walls - just the sound, lingering.  

My breath was slow and heavy as I slowly shambled to the window and peered through the blinds. On the second floor of my motel, I got a clear view of the cold street below, flickering with moths and broken streetlamps. Among the noisy visage of the night I noticed a static outline, barely visible through the blinking lamp above. I focused and strained until a figure emerged from this shape. Curves and long, dark hair. Another knock, its origin still in question, rattled throughout my room, making me flinch. Yet it could not drag my attention away from her for long. Across the street, almost entirely adjacent to my room, motionless, she stood. My gaze fixed on her, following the contour of her body, desperately attempting to define some detail. 

Suddenly another knock came and with it a snap of her neck as she tilted her head. She was looking directly at me. I didn’t breathe. Didn’t blink. The streetlight flickered again, casting her face into brief, haunting clarity. Pale skin, dark eyes that seemed to pierce right through me, like she knew my every thought, every secret. It's Gabriella. There she was under the light of a streetlamp, her long brunette hair slouched down and covered some of her face, but I still knew it was her, unmistakably so.  

A coward I am, of course, I shut the blinds, slid down the wall and sat on my ass until it left, or I passed out.

Entry 10  

Around late September is when I no longer could consider them human.  

They’d often say things simultaneously which caused them to cut each other off and start and stop sentences. Any form of out loud communication was a frustrating mess. Until they stopped speaking all together. A confused chaos slowly dying down into silence. Silence for us, however, I’m sure the storm of voices continued beyond the veil of their minds. 

Their undesirable financial situations taken advantage of as we dangle a paycheck in front of them, just so we could do as we please to them, their bodies, and their minds. 

One day I just stared at them with pity and anxiety. As close to the window as I could get, I focused on these poor people and couldn’t help but think that they were eerie. The deepest point of the uncanny valley, the thalweg of it. “For some reason,” I thought. “Maybe it’s the look in their eyes, I don’t know, I just don't think they’re human anymore.” 

“But we are human.” They spoke in monotoned unison. Just as I processed what they had said, I noticed that they had all stopped and begun staring through the one-sided glass. No, not just past the glass, but at me. Each test subject was staring directly into my eyes! Panic and fear instantly formed within me. My palms moistened and I froze. As did the observing room.  Even more eyes had befallen upon me, I was surrounded by puzzled expressions. I was the center of everyone's attention. They answered me. 

“What was that about?” Craig directed his question at me. They looked over at Craig. Our microphone was certainly off, yet even if it was on that doesn’t explain how they answered me. This wasn’t right. I thought they were only supposed to connect with each other. I didn’t sign up for this. 

“Arthur?” Alexa was just as confused. I turned to them and refused to live in denial. 

“They read my thoughts.” I confessed. We could do nothing but write an incident report, continue our notes, and follow up with more tests. We tried to get them to do it again, but they were mostly unresponsive. 

It was around this time they started sleeping together. They pushed a few of their beds together and packed in like sardines. Soon to be like tuna. They sometimes kissed each other and murmured together. 

Days later, without further incident, I awoke from one of my usual nightmares. In the dead of night, I approached the monitoring system. Splayed out on a few monitors I watched them sleep. I wish I had just stayed in bed, at least then maybe I would've been able to sleep that night. They weren’t asleep, just pretending to be. Through the white noise of our speakers, barely picked up by the microphones in their room, the test subjects hummed together once again. 

“You harbor a great guilt, Mr. Miller.” 

I went to bed and begged and pleaded to some higher being that I could just fall asleep and forget all of this. Sleep did not come. 

The following day I buried these memories and tried to find solace in idle small talk about anything else. Craig somehow looked and acted even more like a corpse than before, Alexa made it very clear that she did not want to speak to me, so I approached Gabriella. She was deep in her notes once again. I’ve noticed Gabriella’s once pristine notes now lie in ruin. Barely legible chicken scratches cover the pages. Her beautiful hair is now tangled and knotted. She smells. As I greet her, she slams her book shut and nervously replies   
“M-Mr. Miller? Hello! Sorry I was just...” she was frazzled. Something was different about her, more than the obvious, something within. “Yesterday, they spoke to you... have you ever spoken back?” What could she possibly mean by this? The subjects, the look in her eyes, I wanted no part in it.   
“No.” is all I said, before leaving and getting back to work. 

All they do anymore is sit together, silent. They wear each other's clothes, sometimes they don't wear anything. They eat each other's food, occasionally “baby birding” food to each other, as Gabriella put it. Soon we will contact whoever is closest to these people and let them know that they will not be coming back. We inform subjects not to allow any of their points of contact to know what they are doing or why they are missing. If things go wrong, they’re death is made to look like an accident, they’re chosen points of contact get notified of this first. It's rare, but such cases do happen. This will be one such case. They knew what they were signing up for. They are beyond help. 

Looking at them makes my head hurt. 

 

**03/19/25 - 0950** 

Entry 11 ?

It was the 20^(th) of November. 1832hrs. 

The Heartful crescendo of a symphony meant to grace the chests of those in need of their fight or flight instincts drummed through my body, circulating adrenaline to each end of my being. Caused by a site that no human has come across before. My gut retched as evil began to form before me. 

The test subjects curled forward and began screaming. It started as a slow groan but only continued to get louder and louder... 

 

*The letter belonged to Gabriella; the cleanliness of her handwriting is unmistakable.  It’s a far cry from the mess of a page I’d last seen her scribble out. I finally had the courage to tear open and examine the innards of what had caused me so much anxiety and fear ever since I found it. It hurts my head to read. Flashes of everything come and go. The tidy calligraphy that danced around the page sat before me. The choreography I’d seen Gabriella perform so many times before during our time at the observation room, this time, directed to me...* 

 

 

“What's the matter?! What do you feel?!” Craig barked at the microphone. Their only response was further agonizing screams. Slowly, they began to slug to each other, tearing off their clothes. Throats were audibly carving as their mournful wails slowly synchronized in dreadful harmony. They came together in a sweaty embrace. I could notice melting skin sticking and stretching out to hold the hands of the others, warmly longing and sinking into a sickening fusion. They broke their bones just to get closer, flesh tore, eyes popped and melted. Biting and clawing at each other, fingering and digging into their wounds. They spat and drooled and cried and bled. I don't know how, but they truly began to melt. A slow, horrific process where we could do nothing but observe. They pushed each other in, like clothes in an already full suitcase, any piece hanging out angrily shoved back in. By the time security showed up to try and pull them apart it seemed it was too late, the task impossible. Only Alexa had the confidence to lurch her food from her stomach onto the floor, the rest of us suspended in fear. The guards slowly backed away, looking to us for an explanation... 

 

 

*Can you imagine how quiet the lab has become since you left? Every corridor feels a little emptier; every monitor is a little dimmer.*   
 

*Are you alright out there? All on your own. We can help each other you know.*   
 

*Remember the good times we had? All our little private chats. We can spend much more time together. Alone.*   
 

*Come back to us. It'll be a drastically different environment. We're happy. We’ll help them. We’ll help you. I know you’ll come back.*   
 

*Once you return, the process of developing treatment for our subjects will get underway.*   
 

*So, once you arrive, we’ll welcome you back with open arms. Let's fix what we did*   
   
*Arthur. We look forward to your return. - Gabi...* 

 

 

 

Eventually it seemed their enfoldment had ceased. They were molding each other into one; their skulls were formed atop one another unevenly, layered like conjoined quintuplets. The details of their faces were lost. Not a single eye survived the merge, yet each of their jaws did, although broken and shifted in wrong directions, their rows of fangs hiding behind one another, like a human shark. So large and dark and terrible, a night sky, each star a jutting tooth. Surrounding this void was what looked like an old, healed burn victim's skin, impossibly pale and desperately latching onto its now thickened cranium. There were two slits in the middle, a remnant, or perhaps an imitation, of a nose. It had no ears, at least none that would work. Some vague shapes of ears could be found around its head and neck, but they did not have any holes. Yet it still had some very small orifices scattered around its face. Maybe some sort of attempt at an evolutionary necessity to allow its skin to breathe. It had wet greasy strands of hair, although not many, as most were ripped out in clumps during their combination. If you look closely, you can tell that patches of flesh have molded over the top of a lot of their locks, like mounds of gum stuck on a woman's head. Its thick neck fumbled and folded into its enlarged body, which was thick, yellow, and mutilated, undulating and writhing, getting used to its new form. A fat mass of limbs of varying sizes. It had a main pair of arms and legs, the rest of their limbs were scattered and mostly engulfed. A finger here, a toe there, its left arm was a combination of two, seemingly the two younger males. A hand could be seen wrapped around its own neck, still twitching every now and then. Some hands and feet had extra digits, some had fewer. Some digits had nails, some didn’t, some had several. It sat there and breathed, chest heaving and falling, at first in jerks and spasm, but it soon found its rhythm... 

 

 

*I know it's not from her, not really her. But it's a nice idea. That all will be well when I get back. But it won't be. Things will still be screwed in every way with everyone involved. Not like things are better here, wherever here is.* 

*I don’t even know who’s left. Fuck, for all I know there isn’t anyone who hasn’t been intertwined in that mental spider web. Knots and kinks and tangles of thoughts and people. It’s got Gabreilla, I know that much...* 

 

 

 

Stillness and mouths agape on our side of the glass. As if Medusa herself had laid her wicked curse upon all that observed this horrific scene. The fear and confusion crippled us. Alexa cried in her puddle of vomit. At this instance I knew this was not the work of science nor any righteous god. Before we knew what to do with ourselves, it spoke. Through its terrible jaws and the flaws that come with a new body it found its voice, through wheezes into splatters into groans into words, words that clawed and shambled out of the deepest part of its gullet.  

“We. Are. one.” 

Lives upon lives, uprooted and entangled together creating a mind-numbing brew of consciousness. 

For a long time, it allowed us to study and contemplate what we would do next. Dozens of minutes of pointless deliberation until ultimately it decided it was done. We heard it again, but it did not speak. At first, it shared its pleasure and its understanding. It liked its news form. The presence of each other as one. They now knew themselves and were free from judgment. They had knowledge like no other, a swirling delicious concoction of bliss, and they gave us a taste. It was disgusting. Having this perverted creature wriggle its way into my mind. I felt violated. Next, it showed us the flaw of individuality. Our flaws... 

 

 

*I don’t know what it wants. I don't know why it showed us those things. Maybe I’ll try to find out...* 

 

 

We saw Gabriella Anderson, looking at Arthur. At night she would think about him privately. She would then cry after. 

We saw Alexa Petrov driving, drinking. She hit a man. No one knew. She saw the funeral from a distance. A father. 

Craig Boris, disdain, regret. Arguing with his wife, Mitchelle Geneviève. Loving his wife. He blamed himself for her passing. He never wanted to be a father, and he told her so. 

Arthur Miller, sleeping with Mitchelle Geneviève...

1p9exde,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p9exde/am_i_being_flirted_with_by_the_bookstore_cashier/,Am I being flirted with by the bookstore cashier?,"I want to start with the fact that I (33F) am autistic and am VERY bad at social cues. I try to pay attention, but sometimes it's to the point of over analyzing. 

I have also read a lot of stories on Reddit where anybody in a customer facing job has to be nice because that's their job, and people are always being told that, no, that is just good customer service, not flirting. 

So with both of these facts in mind, I wanted to ask opinions before I spiral further down the what-ifs. 

I have been going to this bookstore for a long time now. The cashier (F, 30s-ish?) has been working there for the past year or so, and is usually on shift around the times of day that I tend to go in. A couple months ago I mentioned that my girlfriend and I had broken up, and ever since then I have noticed a shift in her behavior, but it also might be I just didn't notice before. 

She doesn't make a lot of eye contact with other customers, but she seems to make a lot with me. It’s not just a glance. She holds my gaze for a beat too long, until I’m the one who has to look away. But eye contact feels weirdly intimate for me and maybe it's just because she is more comfortable with me now that she's gotten to know me while she's worked here.

And she’s always nearby now. I’ll be browsing and suddenly she’s there, dusting a shelf that already looks clean to me, or re-alphabetizing a row that’s perfectly fine. She stands close enough that it's definitely within normal people's ""bubble"" and not just my bubble (which is a little larger than most folks). It feels intentional, but it could also just be a coincidence. This is a small store. Where else is she supposed to be?

Last week she saw me come in and just said “I put the new [author] book behind the counter for you” without me even asking. Is that just her being a good bookseller? Making a regular feel special? It’s probably store policy to be nice like that. But she also doesn't seem to do it for the old dude who buys every Western book they get in?

She smiles at me differently, I think. She has her standard customer-service smile that's quick and polite. But sometimes, when I first walk in, she gives me this smaller almost softer(?) smile before the other one comes out. It’s there and then it’s gone. But what if I’m just imagining that?

She asks me questions she doesn't ask the other customers. Not just ""did you find everything okay?” but things like “what are you getting lost in this week” or “do you have any nice plans after this"" or specifics about the books or authors I've been reading. They’re questions that require a real answer, and she actually waits for one. It makes me feel like I have to have something interesting to say, which I never do. But again maybe it's because she's just more familiar with me and we have similar taste in books.

The things making me doubt myself the most are like extended hand contact when she hands me my change or my books. She also started wearing a rainbow pin and asked me what I thought of it. And yesterday she made me a to go cup of my favorite tea (from her personal stash, they don't like sell tea and coffee and stuff there). But I can still find an innocent explanation for all of these.

And I know I can be weird. I am just so awkward in social interactions. So much so that the other cashier (he only started shadowing her a couple weeks ago) has started nudging her and walking away when I come in so I'm assuming I've made him uncomfortable at some point and now she is the designated me-handler or something. 

Either way, I think it would be inappropriate to ask her out. Just full stop, I won't risk asking her. But, if she is flirting with me, how do I open that door for her to ask me? But I can't even really wrap my head around that because of what if she isn't? I don't want to be the asshole customer assuming an employee who is just being nice is actually flirting.

They aren’t human anymore. Don’t forget that. Don’t listen to it, don’t look at it, don’t think, don't even think. If you see it or get near it or sense its agents are nearby, or you start suddenly thinking about sunflowers, or feel anything out of the ordinary, close off your mind and think happy thoughts until you’re out of range. At this point I don’t know how far they have spread, but I want this warning out there while I can still give it. 

**03/03/25 – 0900 hours** 

Entry 1 

I worked at a government testing facility. I ran away, leaving my coworkers to clean up the mess. This is less of an exposé piece and more of a confessional, so the details of its location and such are irrelevant. I just pray this might abstain me of some of my sins. I’m not a religious man but I now know there are things beyond this world, or at the very least, our understanding of it, so I might as well try and cover ass. 

I also think it wants me to tell you all about it... I’m not sure. A throbbing pain permeates inside my skull, clouding my thoughts. It’s a constant pressure from within, sitting behind my eyes, travelling all the way through to the back of my head, caressing me as it fades down my spine. It’s consistency and my nebulous mind has created a constant brain fog, so forgive me if my writing is nonsensical at any point. 

I’ve seen my fair share of horrible things. To be honest, we’re not entirely ethically sound there. But it helps us all sleep at night if we think we’re doing something for the greater good at the end of the day, finding comfort in some self-imposed moral ambiguity. Yet no amount of mental gymnastics can excuse what we’ve done. 

August 17^(th), a team debrief was held to establish understanding of our next project. Bright and early in the morning my four other colleagues and I filed into the observation room, its interior white like sugar - glistening, pristine surfaces covering every square inch. We gather in the corner, beside the hissing coffee machine, in a queue waiting for our turn. A window into the world we would watch daily filled the wall opposite us. Our debriefer followed us in and stood in front of it. The window and him separated by our workstations, long tables connected and covered in computers and stationery. At first glance it hardly resembled a research lab, more akin to an interrogation room. 

Our debriefer read from a clipboard, barely able to see past the mounds of eye bags that rest between his tired gaze and his reading material, droned on about a new, experimental, “revolutionary”, form of communication, lips loose as each word fell out of his mouth. Not a single person in the room was convinced; we all just took notes and followed along begrudgingly like anyone on a Monday morning would. The debriefer looked like Monday morning incarnate. Craig, the man on my right, letting out sigh as he wrote, the woman on my left was visibly rolling her eyes. I’d worked with this team before, some members more than others, and we were no strangers to failed experiments. In fact, I used to work with Craig a lot, and at one point, I even considered him a friend. In recent years, Craig has endured a melancholic depression due to the passing of his wife years ago. Suicide. 

Suddenly, what felt like an encore of my morning alarm shook me to attention, waking me more than its predecessor. However, this alarm took the form of a mess of a professor bursting through the door, almost crashing into our desks, then steadying himself as he stood next to our debriefer. A flurry of emotions spewed from this man's demeanor, from frustration to excitement to exhaustion to... paranoia? He was a mess. Untucked shirt, titled glasses, messy hair. He had the eyes of a man lacking sleep, as well as the desire to do so. Yet his chin held so high all he could do is look down on us. As if he could grace the gods themselves. He did not have an ego or high self-esteem. His sin was the pride he had for his work. 

“This is no ordinary communication technique!” He announced, emphasizing his words with dramatic hand movements. “Listen well please. I have designed a quick procedure that alters minds. You can think of it as a form of mental walkie-talkie, if you wish to keep your view skewed, just know that it is so much more than that. They have unlocked, um-” a brief pause, lost in thought. “No, actually, I won't get into the details.” He stammered. He went on, and during his tirade our previous debriefer and this raving loon had come to a non-verbal agreement that the old debriefers' work here was done, as he handed over his clipboard and shambled out of the room.    
“All I need from you all is to follow the tests I put in your mission outlines and take extremely detailed notes.” The professor said. He walked to the door, this time much calmer and purposeful. “Telepathy people. This is telepathy.” He said over his shoulder on his way out. I now notice that the room's tone had shifted to curious and awake. He couldn’t be serious, right? Maybe he put receivers in these poor people's brains that read their thoughts and sent them to the others. Yet somehow the way he’s talking about it makes it seem worse and more complicated than that. Telepathy? This building is for science, not magic.  

All we could do as a team was share a few confused glances before our mission began. Five people, each wearing button up shirts with their allocated number, entered the room beyond the glass wall. Their new home was big enough to comfortably fit them all, full of beds, two private bathrooms in the back-end corners of the room, male and female, a dining table and chairs, and a shelf of reading material present opposite the door they came in. We were to watch these people through our one-sided window for an undisclosed amount of time. And they had “telepathy”. “Ridiculous” was the conclusion I came to. 

 

 

As I’m recounting my experiences here, I’ve realized that my head is spinning, and the sweat is starting to pool at the base of my keyboard. I wish none of this was true, I wish to return home, I wish to not know what I know. It terrifies me. Anxiety is swelling up in my throat and it's all beginning to bubble over. The room is shifting and rotating like I’m a lost sock in a broken washing machine filled with shit. My heart sinks below the floorboards of the filthy shack that I've found myself in. Even below the surface I can feel it pounding and urging me to stay alert. Eyes are on me. I’m surrounded by whispering voices that want in, but I won’t let them get to me. Bangs on the door rattle through my ear drum, piercing my skull with each thump, and I feel as though I’m going to collapse. I heave and I heave but nothing leaves me. No barf. No breath. Only desperate wheezes.  

Until it stops.  

Silence. 

Maybe this was a mistake. 

 

**03/04/25 – 1300 hours** 

Entry 2 

Whatever “procedure” the professor spoke of earlier had already taken place. All that was left was to test and observe. 

The first few days were boring and normal. They all engaged in small talk and got to know each other. A young Korean girl, maybe in her early twenties (She was labelled number 1 on her uniform), confided with a single mother from Bangladesh, she had the most caring eyes and had a strong maternal instinct (number 2). A shorter Caucasian man, (3) was telling an equally short, older uncle from Singapore (4) about his gambling troubles (the reason he’s here). The Singaporean listened intently and tried to give advice with his hands comfortably sitting behind his back. The gambler did not listen in return, only vented. A tall African American man (5) immediately inspected the collection of reading material on the shelves. He seemed quiet and was by far the most physically fit in the group. 

Their life details and anything that may be important are in our files. We were encouraged to still use their numbers, not their names. According to our records these were test subjects, not people, it’s almost barbaric. A lot of people here only saw them as such, subjects that aided in the advancement of, well, whatever the government wished to advance, I suppose. Craig was always against this. Made him furious that they “weren't even granted the basic human decency to have a name.” Even now, I can't remember their names. 

 

Test 1- 

It was simple. We ask them to briefly tell us how they’re feeling, what they’re thinking about, then to think of something specific.  

Korean girl (1) was first- 

“okay”, “home”. 

“Think of sunflowers.” Craig spoke to them through a speaker. 

Bangladesh woman (2)- 

“tired”, “my children”, again, told to think of sunflowers.  

By this point we’d forgotten the professor's speech, and the drawl of work took us over again, sifting through tests and notes as our tasks wore on. 

The gambler (3)- 

“bored”, “money,” sunflowers. 

Singaporean uncle (4)- 

“Huh? Oh! Happy"", “my new friends.” Sunflowers. 

The fit dark-skinned man (5)- 

“intrigued”, “your book collection.” Sunflowers. 

We then went on to record their brain activity, blood pressure, etc. All baseline stuff. We repeated these tests every three hours for the first day with no noteworthy results. At 2200 hours our coworker, Dylan, a gruff man and a heavy cynic, grabbed the microphone to speak to our guests.  

“Do any of you feel anything worth noting?” He grumbled past his thick beard.  

“... I’m tired of thinking about sunflowers. hahaha” the Singaporean uncle chimed.  

“Do the rest of you feel this way?” Dylan asked the room. His question was answered with shrugs and silence. After a sigh he asked “Hear any... voices? In your head that... aren’t your own?”   
He was jumping a bit forward. These tests were specifically structured. We weren’t sure how much the patients knew of what the results of the procedure were, but I knew he was not supposed to ask that. I suppose it didn’t matter as his question was once again greeted by a confused silence. “Typical.” Dylan huffed, off mic, to only himself, I suppose. He walked away and promptly clocked off for the night. Dylan would be in deep shit once this got out, the higher ups are very particular. He was prone to frustrated out bursts at tests he thought were a waste of time.    
“What do you mean “voices”?” The tall number 5 asked. We had no answer to give to our neighbors on the other side of the window, so we gave no answer. Anything outside of taking notes and tests was above our pay grade anyway, so we all began packing up and clocking out too. 

Gabriella, Craig, and I were the last to leave. Gabriella was shy and thorough with her notes, so she stayed a while to revise and observe at her station. She was deep in her files like a cave diver dislocating themselves just to enter a virgin passage, a hair tie holding back her deep brunette hair from hindering her work. She only halted every now and then to push up her thick framed glasses. I was tired and made myself another coffee on my way out, Craig joined me, though we didn’t speak, so I passed silent glances between Gabriella, the test subjects, and my feet, as if they were playing some invisible three-way tennis match. We, the lucky few, witnessed their first signs. “Stupid sunflowers.” The Korean girl, the gambler, and the Singaporean uncle moaned in unison. They looked at each other confused, as did we. They began a debate on coincidence or not. An hour of overtime note taking and observing, and the rest of us window watchers were able to head home. 

 

This was the first time they did that, spoke in unison I mean, lord knows it's not the last.  

I can still hear their synchronized groans. 

I need a drink before I think about this anymore.

I forgot to write today (yesterday?). Forgetting feels nice. Easily achievable with the appropriate amount of pain killers and alcohol. I’ve made sure to stock my temporary motel room with said supplies and spent the day partaking in them. It doesn’t help the dizziness, but I finally feel mental quiet and physical numbness. 

I don’t know why I’m even hiding. Why I’m jumping from motel to motel. It could find me if it wants. I’m sure if anyone else from my old job was looking for me, they’d find me too.  

It just feels right. To run. It's all I can do. 

I’m sorry, Craig, if you're out there. I didn’t mean for this to happen. Any of it. 

That last look you gave me will haunt me the most.

Entry 4 

Day two of the experiment wasn’t noteworthy, except for the fact that Dylan didn’t come in. In fact, he never came in again. Who knows if he got fired or if another terrible fate befell him. We went on as usual, though. Test, watch as their food is delivered and eaten, test, watch, test. More baselines, asking them how they’re feeling, etc., etc 

In-between tests I tried to make small talk mixed with half assed attempts at humor with Craig and the rest of the crew. “Lovely day for it, huh?” knowing we’d be inside our windowless box all day, the weather not affecting us in the slightest. I don’t think they heard me, because they didn’t laugh. Gabriella buried herself in her work, the woman I didn't know the name of would give one-word answers out of politeness but clearly did not want to be spoken to (I did learn her name was Alexa though). And Craig, well, the usual, barely receiving eye contact let alone a conversation. His eyes were sunken and soulless, and he’d lost the extra weight he had around him and then some. He’s still torn up inside over what happened. Does he know it eats away at me too? I don’t know what led us to continue to work here, but here we are, the invisible hand of fate guiding us along. 

I stewed in my own anguish for most of that day. Silent crew, lack luster results, Craig, all of it was dragging me down. At the time I remember wanting nothing more than a drink, but my 2-month company mandated sobriety streak loomed over me, so a coffee would have to suffice.  

The professor snapped me out of my mental crisis with yet another unannounced intrusion.    
“After receiving your reports yesterday, I updated your work outline. I’m aware that there are cameras that are monitored, and the recordings are checked, however, I have brought up the possibility of 24-hour personnel monitoring with the higher ups, and they seem to agree.” This alone would’ve brought my blood pressure up another notch, resulting in a very good reason to break my sobriety. If it weren’t for his next sentence, that worsened things still. “So, if anything... happens, we have eyewitnesses. They called me mad, but I already know this will be a great success.” This man and his cryptic nonsense were going to send me over the edge today. 

“Are you going to explain a single thing to us? How can we do our job without the facts? Now we’re supposed to monitor them 24/7?” I hissed through clenched teeth, stress weighing on me. 

“We don’t know the details of what happened to these people or what will happen. Do they even know?” Craig announced, stepping forward. Craig was a selfless, soft man. He wasn’t even surprised about the extra hours, he just wants to help these people. Looking at him, I noticed that he’d turned pale. 

“We’re getting paid overtime for this right?” Alexa added. 

“Yes, yes. Please trust me, we will get to all that soon. In the meantime, ... Do your fucking jobs.” The Professors smiley answer turned to a spit and a snarl. On his way out, he mentioned one last thing. “You will be paid double for this of course.” 

We apparently need the money just as much as the people beyond the glass because at the end of the day we’re all still here. Exiting our observation room, at the end of the hall, past the locked door of the test subjects, is our new home, fitted with beds, a kitchen, a bathroom and of course a full camera monitoring set up so we can continue our work, day in, day out. We were only allowed in this room outside of regular working hours. Anyone not agreeing to these terms and who wants to go home was instructed to do so but not to return.

Entry 5 

There was a knock at my door last night, at least I think there was. Of course I didn’t answer, I didn’t even have the courage to get out of bed. It came during my extensive nightly attempt to sleep after my last entry. Just three quick taps of my motel door, a fair few feet away from me and instantly my breath was caught in my chest, I was unable to move a muscle. Like stone, like I wasn’t even alive, I lay there unmoving, waiting. Waiting for what, I don’t know, but the lord knows I waited. Waiting while the room is filled with nothing but the ticking clock above my head, heart lurching with every tick. And dread. The room was filled with dread, up to the brim. My ears catching every sound, I swear I could hear my own blood pump and yet I couldn’t tell if my heart was as still as I was or if it was fluttering and fleeing the confines of my ribcage. It must have been hours before I almost had the courage to shuffle an inch again. Alas, before my freedom was granted, another knock came. Another quick three taps. How could this be? The exact same knock, hours apart. I was surely hearing things again, I must be. But this felt so real, and my delusions come in quick intense spats, not this prolonging torture.  

Was it there? On the other side of the door. Waiting as I too am waiting. Still, as I too am still! Barely breathing as I too am barely breathing! I must be going mad. I can’t take this anymore, I thought. Now I knew for certain that my heart was racing, pumping, pounding! I was about to get up. Dear god I was actually about to go face this thing. Launch from my bed and lunge at the door, a desperate attack, an attempt better than nothing. Better than laying here for eternity. A clashing of symbols, an impact of a waterfall, a climax of an explosion, a RUSH. Fighting the bed sheets that engulfed me, I escaped my own mental restraints and sprinted for the door. Before even a blink could arrive, I did. Right at the door. Fate on the other side.  

 

 

Of course it was empty. Of course nothing was there. I stood with the door swung open and nothing but cool air brushing against me like a mother caressing and calming a child. As I began to close the door, as it slid past my face and almost shut, I saw it.  

 

A letter sat at my feet.  

 

**03/08/25 - 1652 hours** 

Entry 6 

By now it was August 28th, and we had adjusted to our living standards quickly. Alexa and Gabriella got along well, sharing notes, theories, and even started talking about their personal lives. Gabriella wanted to start her own lab and studies. Me and Craig even began to talk. Small talk and work talk but still talk. 

I pushed open the door to our main observation room that morning, balancing a paper cup filled with coffee on my clipboard, free hand used to button up my shirt. Craig was already there, leaning against the counter, staring through the glass. 

“Morning,”. I said as I joined him. 

Craig snorted. “Barely. You look like you lost a fight with your alarm clock.” 

“I did,” I replied. “It won by a landslide.” 

“Good to see you’re still getting your sleep.”  

I scoffed. “I wouldn’t say that” 

“Struggling huh?” He took a sip from his own coffee. “Yeah, me too. If they’re going to force us to sleep here, they could at least give us some half decent mattresses.” 

We shared a chuckle, even though we both knew the mattresses weren’t the issue. Then we went to work. We had a routine and things were nice. The subjects reported nothing more than difficulty sleeping, increased appetite and a small amount of anxiety, all of which could be attributed to their environment, so we brought in some requested items for each of them. The Bangladesh woman requested a photo of her family, the Singaporean uncle requested a potted plant, the gambler wanted his marriage ring (he was divorced), the African American man wanted a book from home, and the Korean girl shyly requested her bear plushy, said it helped her sleep. 

It was going smoothly. Those were the best days of the experiment. The last good day of our lives.  

“What’d you say?” The gambler said as he got up from his bed. Confused glances spread throughout their room as we, the watchers, leaned forward at our workstations.  “Don’t act dumb! What did you say? I “stink”?!” He said something along those lines. This time he received a series of “Huh's” and “what’s”, confusion and tension growing. His gaze was locked onto the Korean girl sitting on the floor with her bear plushy. Her innocence radiated from her, yet the gambler was in denial. He approached her and swiftly yanked her bear away from her.  

“I didn’t say shit, you freak!” She screamed in retaliation. “You do stink though.” she grumbled under her breath. This girl was usually quiet, for such a sudden outburst the plushy must’ve meant a lot to her. She couldn’t have been younger than 19 yet she clung to it like a child. By this escalation, the rest of the room began defending the girl.    
“What? No, I’m not crazy... I-” he said with shaky breaths as he held his head with one hand and the bear with the other. “No. No! I know what this is. This isn’t how it was meant to be. He said it was like a walkie-talkie! We can just turn it off. Are you able to hear what I think without my consent!? Why can I hear you all! Judging me!” He shouted, fear in his voice, holding the bear high.  

 

Test 2- 

Craig once again had control of the microphone as he instructed the room to calm down and return the girl's belongings to her. They were told to sit on their respective beds and listen. 

“Number one, I need you to focus. Please tell us what you're thinking,” Craig asked. 

“I want to go home. Are you sure I’ll be safe in here?” The girl said. Her rage had subsided and was replaced with a growing fear.  

“Please look at the rest of your roommates and decide if you can understand what they are thinking"" Craig visibly gulped down his empathy as he forced himself to ignore the girl's question and follow the script in our work outline. 

“No, I have no idea what they’re thinking.” She responded. 

“Number two, what are you thinking about?” Craig continued. 

“I think Number three should be removed from this experiment after that outburst.” The Bangladesh woman confessed. 

“Please look at the rest of your roommates and decide if you can understand what they are thinking,"" Craig repeated. After some deep thought, she had an answer for this seemingly silly question. 

“I think... someone is thinking of sunflowers again.”  

“Number three-” Craig began. 

“This is bullshit” The gambler cut off the voice echoing out of the speaker. “And I think someone wants their bear back” he continued. Odd, since the girl already had her bear plushy returned to her. 

“Number four.” 

“Well, uh, I must admit I was thinking of sunflowers.” The old Singaporean sat, staring at the Bangladesh woman who stared back. “I think she’s thinking of her children.” 

“Number five.” 

“I... want my bear back...” The large man sat so smally as he said this, staring at his hands and hunched over.  

“That is all for now.” one last note from Craig before he turned off the microphone and leaned back in his chair, brushing his hair back with a long exhale. The people inside the room split off into their usual groups and quietly discussed the results of this test. Number five sat on his own and read. We took our notes. 

 

**03/09/25 - I don't know what time it is** 

Entry 7 

My mirror was altered this morning. Everything morphed back to that place it took me. It felt like a stone had dropped inside my stomach once I realized what I was looking at. I was frozen, my eyes glued to the gaping maw of that beast's labyrinth that it had put me in. It was grinning. The walls melting around me, pooling at my feet, momentary madness coalescing as I witness spiraling swirls of chaos slowly forming from memories. Reflection shifted from me to Gabriella’s and Craig’s disgusted glare before I ran away and never came back. I abandoned them then and there. Then shifting once more to that thing. Then finally, to that place. 

The memory emerged through thick clouds of steam that clung to the mirror before they evaporated. I saw a longing held back behind tight lips for years. The face of someone I’d known for many more. The face of someone I loved for far too late. All along, these feelings were shared between us. What had we done? A passionate moment shared between friends. Friends.   
“Arthur... Arthur!”   
A moment and a mistake made a life. A life, not belonging to him, but to me. A life that ended too soon, before it even left the womb. That part was no one's fault. Guilt, shame, sadness, loss, resulting in the loss of another. 

I loved her first. It's not my fault. 

It showed me it all again. It showed everyone. Things I tried to desperately forget. There is no forgetting now. 

I could feel beads of sweating form and slide from every pore. I may have stood in that puddle of sweat for an hour, reliving what I’d done all over again. Worlds of pleasure and anguish had become too much, and I collapsed into a pathetic ball on my bathroom floor. I couldn’t resist crying.

1p9ewxz,https://i.redd.it/hljta4k7c44g1.jpeg,Statement On Recent Legislative Failures,"A broad amount of my bills that passed the legislature has been vetoed by the president this evening, to make matters work a fellow MP has branded a certain preference clause in my bills ‘reckless’. I believe I must address these things. 

Firstly, there was a misunderstanding earlier today regarding whether one bill had been overridden or could have properly been vetoed. I apologize for my demanding and self-righteous demeanor, it was wrong. 

Secondly, the bills that were vetoed. 

First and foremost is the Mom and Pop  resuscitation act, where we intended to remove certain economic stressors on small businesses such as high taxes (as long as they cooperated with certain public policy tax breaks), along with lowering the minimum wage for their businesses and creating a flat tax for cooperatives so they can compete with large corporations. This was vetoed because it is believed that small businesses like the pizza parlor, the coffee shop or the corner store can afford to give all employees a minimum of 44,000 cR and year… which is only 8,000 less than the *average* wage of most developed nations. 

Second, The Fair Corporation Tax Act that adjusted the corporate tax on medium and large corporations such that they are competitive with the highest in the world. The only way these corporations may escape such taxes is by fulfilling outlined public policy tax breaks such as 

* Union members on the board of directors

* Paying every employee an increased Salary

* Green Energy initiatives 

* Mandatory Stock Options to all employees to increase worker ownership of the company. 

Third, the debt restructuring act. This bill actually passed parliament twice but because I forgot to publicly present the bill the first time, we had to vote on it again. It was criticized for thrusting federal debt on the provinces. This is just not true. I respect the sovereignty of the provinces and that’s the bill required the agreement of at least 2 provincial governments. Additionally the provinces would have benefitted from this bill, having us bank roll the beginning of their own lines of credit along with additional investment where they could have spent where they pleased. 

Fourth, The Grocery Cover act pays 504 cR as a UBI which matches the monthly cost of groceries per family. Yet it is awarded to every adult, not every household. Most households with married couples will be receiving an 1008 cR a month to cover groceries and then some. This conflicts and knocks out per the preference clause, which leads me to my next point.


#Preference Clause Address

The Preference clause essentially reads, ‘if this bill passes this legislative session and it conflicts with a provision in a competing bill in this session, this bill shall take precedent and the conflicting measure of the other bill is repealed.’

This is a multifaceted decision on my part when drafting the bills:

* I understood there would be competing economic bills.
* I knew there was a possibility both my bill and the opposition bill may pass
* Surely the legislators you trusted to read and intelligently vote on bills, read the bills that are presented to them. I read all of them before voting. 
* The read the clause and preferred my solution over the opposition bill. 

I didn’t hide the preference clause, in fact I publicly presented the clause as per the legislative rules. There was no ‘recklessness’ or underhandeness. Simply, an operative clause to prevent constitutional/parliamentary headache. 

#On the Future

With the current hostile government to the reforms of jumpstarting the economy being, amicable with business, while leaving no one behind. Some may say that the Economic Miracle is a myth, that the dream is dead. 


How can dreams die? They never lived to begin with. When a dream becomes living, it is no longer a dream but reality. So we continue this war for affordability and opportunity from the ballot box, the upcoming election is crucial. 

If you value fair play in the economy, if you believe in revitalizing your town’s Main Street with small businesses, if you believe that perhaps… dreams can be guaranteed.

The scene where she asks her husband to leave her brothers house and find a home for themselves (they'd have temporarily moved in with her brother after loosing everything), all her sister-in-law would say is that she had made the coffee for her brother and will make one for her husband now (not insulting or insinuating just mentioned it). But she will realise that she no longer has privileges in her maternal house. I understand the context, if you want to be respected have your own space. But that scene was ridiculous. It felt like making a mountain out of mole hole.

I started *being a person who doesn’t smoke*

That tiny shift changed everything  
Because now every choice was identity training, not a pass/fail test

Here’s what it looked like:

* No “last cigarette” ritual. Just stopped and moved on
* Tracked *what triggered the urge*, not just when I smoked
* Made rules for those triggers (coffee = walk, stress = 10 pushups, not smoke)
* Didn’t restart my “streak” when I slipped, just logged it and kept going
* Spent 5 minutes every morning visualizing who I was becoming, not what I was giving up

1p9ejjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1p9ejjy/i_dont_think_china_is_worth_visiting_again/,I don’t think China is worth visiting again,"I just spent a week in China. It’s the first time I’ve visited after 20 years, and as an adult. 

It’s amazing how they’ve managed to push through development. The air has cleared significantly, even if it’s not fantastic (it’s not smoggy like it was). The tap water has improved drastically (it doesn’t have a weird smell, from what I remember). The quality of the intercity bullet trains is fantastic. The public toilets I saw are actually clean. Gosh, and they do have some gorgeous public parks / mountains.

The people were great too.  I had some really lovely interactions with total strangers, even with the limited mandarin I have. Just yesterday, a cafe opened its doors to me half an hour earlier because it was my last day there and I wanted badly to taste their coffee.

However I absolutely disliked most of what I saw of the people there. Public spitting. Pushing into people without an apology or care. Cutting queues. Smoking. All the damned time and not caring who they’d blow their cigarette smoke into. Or that they’re in a place which says “no smoking”. So much screeching and not giving a damn if they’re doing it right in your ear in public or in the hotel room next door.

This behaviour is literally the same as I’ve seen of Chinese tourists abroad - rudely pushing past people waiting in queues at immigration and passport checks, for example.

Then there’s the intrusiveness and the mental fatigue from just being there. There are annoying electronic voices EVERYWHERE. There are apps with cluttered interfaces you HAVE to use or you can’t get by. The constant passport checking, even just to get on a train.

As a whole, it’s sad. There’s so much of China’s green spaces I want to see now, after getting a glimpse of how gorgeous it is. However I don’t think I’d put myself through all that again.

(For what it’s worth, I’m ethnically Chinese myself. I’m just not from China.)",10,1764387141.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.73,False
1p9ej5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWorkPoop/comments/1p9ej5r/terror_of_the_unknown/,Terror of the unknown,"Years ago, there was a time when I would travel to different branch offices within the company I was working for. At this point I wasn't in management, but was just a good employee who could cover for managers when there were in vacation, or out sick. Sometimes I would be sent places to help train offices on certain procedures. It was pretty fun, I got to travel around my region a bit, stay in hotels and get to act important. 

One of the things that came with this was pooping in unknown locations. I didn't have any fear of this, but it did bring up uncomfortable situations.

The time in question I was sent to Modesto, CA to cover for a branch manager for 5 days. The office was in small office complex with probably three other small companies that shared the two bathrooms. At first I was pretty happy about the situation. The bathrooms were clean and private. They were single bathrooms, meaning 1 door, one toilet, and a lock. So unless someone was pounding on the door you were left to yourself. And again, this was a small complex, so there really weren't many run ins ... And honestly, having an awkward run in would have been far better that what actually happened.

The second day I was in the office I had to poop. To be fair, I pooped everyday, by the second day was when the incident occurred. I walked into the hallway and directly into the bathroom. Easy peasey. I had a couple cups of coffee already that morning so my internal percalation was at its limit. I didn't expect to be in the bathroom long as I sat and relieved myself in peace. But the event, while quick, was more than expected, and the flush immediately revealed a clog.

Terror rose inside out my immediately, but thankfully, the water stopped just below the toilet line. I should have walked away. But this was a more personal type of bathroom, there was a plunger and plenty of fragrant sprays, so I decided to fix the situation.

Grabbing the plunger and gave the clog a few pumps and it appeared to have released ... But, I had to flush again... And that is when the true nightmare began. The clog must have just released enough to clog a bit farther down and the water quickly began to rise and it had already been near the top.

Plunger still in hand I dove in trying to alleviate the rising situation but because of water displacement the only compounded the problem. Dirty water started pour onto the floor, by itself and with each subsequent pump of the plunger. Finally, even as the water was stopping the clog fully released and the water in the toilet fully drained.

I stared around me, petrified by the current situation. I could have walked out, and maybe should have. It was unlikely I would have run into anyone and surely someone else would have called management to have the situation cleaned. But my integrity was too strong. Along with a plunger there were many other bathroom cleaning utensils, and the floor had a decent size build in drain.

For the next 30 minutes I flooded the floor with clean water from the sink and directed it all down the drain, using the strong spray fragrances and praying no one would knock on the door.

This would have been enough to have thoroughly ruined my day. But of course this was not the end. I had thankfully been able to keep myself clean throughout the incident but that doesn't change the fact that I was the acting manager for an office with other employees and I had just been absent for nearly 40 minutes. 

Coming back into the office the employees were wondering where I had been and asking if everything was ok. I didn't dare tell them the tale, and so I just said, I was in the bathroom and quickly walked to the office I was occupying. I didn't leave the office the rest of the day.

I wanted to share a new tool I built called **Vibe Change**.

I often found myself constantly switching tabs to ChatGPT or other tools just to rephrase a sentence or change the tone of an email. I wanted something faster that worked directly where I was typing, so I built this extension to let you apply custom AI prompts via the right-click context menu.​

**What it does:**  
It lets you create and save unlimited custom prompt ""vibes"" (like ""make it professional,"" ""summarize,"" or even specific styles like ""medieval+fun""). Once saved, you can simply highlight text on any webpage, right-click, and select your vibe to transform the text instantly.​

**Key Features:**

* **Context Menu Sync:** Your custom vibes appear immediately in the right-click menu, so you don't have to open the extension popup every time.​
* **Instant Customization:** You can add as many unique prompts as you need for different workflows (marketing, coding, casual emails).​
* **Privacy Focused:** All your vibe data is stored locally in your browser, not on external servers.​

**Who is this for?**  
It’s designed for content creators, marketers, and anyone who needs to adjust text on the fly without disrupting their workflow.​

I’m a 28M grad student from the US (west coast, best coast) and I’ve met some great people here before, so I figured I’d give this another shot and see who I click with this time around.

Lately most of my time has gone into studying, which means I haven’t had many chances to meet new people. That being said, I’ve realized that life gets a lot more interesting when you make space for the right conversations with the right people.

A little about me
* People say I’m kind, patient, and a good listener. I’ll let you decide if that is true.
* I stay active and take care of myself. Gym sessions, cardio, whatever keeps me busy and in shape.
* I’m tatted, I currently have a sleeve I’m thinking about getting more.
* For the curious, I’m 5’11”, dark hair, dark eyes, athletic build, and I put real effort into staying in shape. 
* I study a lot, so I might take a bit to reply, but I always respond.
* I live on pop punk and alt rock. I enjoy shows and movies when I can slow down long enough to watch them. 

I usually click best with people around my age, but I’m open to anyone if the energy is right. If you are active or take care of yourself, you get bonus points. I’m down to make friends, flirt a little, or just have one of those deep late night conversations that make you think about someone a little longer than you expected.

Happy to exchange photos once we talk for a bit. Putting a face to a name makes things more fun, and I like to think I’m worth the reveal.

If something here caught your attention, send me a message. And include a song recommendation so I know you actually made it to the end.

Making friends as a busy working dad with a whole family is almost impossible lol. At least that’s what I’ve noticed. When are you supposed to find time to actually make friends when you’re constantly on the go.

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

I want to make sure that everyone is aware of the smoke sensor scam that the Twin Fin Hotel has going on in Waikiki. My wife and I booked a three-night stay for our honeymoon on O’ahu. The hotel has a ""sensor"" in each room that detects PM2.5, PM10, and VOC levels, and if it gets triggered they automatically charge $500 to your room. They have it set so sensitive that it will get triggered by all sorts of false positives. The first morning we were there, right after making coffee (we bring our own coffeemaker because we are coffee snobs) we got a notice that we received a ""smoking violation"" and therefore we being charged the $500. They give you a sheet with the air quality parameters that they say were associated with you smoking. The sheet they gave us had an extremely low level elevation of PM2.5 and PM10, which could be triggered by so many things e.g. cooking, making coffee, blow drying hair, ironing clothes, etc. This sort of data would not last a second in a courtroom as an argument to confirm someone was smoking. This is absolutely a cash grab, and we now have to dispute the charges. It was absolutely the worst way to start our honeymoon and tbh really ruined the vibe for our vacation. I would 100% avoid this hotel at all costs unless you want to receive ridiculous false charges for ""smoking"". Search online for reviews and you will see that there are a multitude of reports corroborating our experience here.

I also want to mention that I have a background in environmental toxicology and I know a fair bit about air quality parameters. They couldn’t BS me like they are surely doing to others.

**TL;DR:** I mainly want the Baratza Encore (Model 485) for espresso. Is it good enough for consistent home espresso, or is there a better grinder around the same price (or slightly higher)?

I’m considering buying the Baratza Encore, but I’d mostly use it for espresso. I currently have a Hamilton Beach 40715, and I plan to upgrade later — maybe to a De’Longhi Bambino or something similar.

Right now I’m using a manual burr grinder, and to be fair, it works pretty well. I get good flavor and extraction times. The downside is how long it takes — especially in the morning when I’m making coffee for **three people**. That’s the main reason I’m looking for an electric grinder.

I know the Encore is usually recommended for pour-over, but I’d like to hear from people who’ve used it specifically for espresso on home machines. I’m assuming it should at least outperform my manual grinder, but I’m not 100% sure.

For reference, the Encore here costs about **$111 USD**, and while I also have a couple of blade grinders, they’re completely useless for espresso.

The Joepresso sells for $25. I can get the RB tommorow morning for $35 on an Amazon Black Friday deal.

I haven't seen many recipes for the RB other than soup shots. Supposedly,  it's extra good for decaf brews as well  but I have no complaints with the AP in that regard. 

So, is it worth getting the RB or is this just G.A.S.?  I've been curious for a year but haven't v pulled the trigger  I already have a half dozen brewers I seldom use.

The Crimson Room wasn’t a place for innocent little girls.

It was a place where grown women came to surrender control, to let men like me strip away their pretenses along with their clothes.

So what the fuck was she doing here?

I leaned against the bar, nursing a glass of Jameson and watching the brunette who’d been eye-fucking me for the past hour. She was sitting alone at a corner table, wearing a skimpy black dress which I suspected was really uncomfortable.

Like the dress, everything else about her screamed that she didn’t belong.

The way she kept fidgeting with her purse. The way her eyes darted around the room like she expected someone to arrest her for being here. The way she’d been nursing the same vodka tonic since she’d arrived.

“She’s been asking about you,” Seamus, my bartender and one of my oldest friends, said as he polished a glass. “Wants to know if the rumors are true.”

“What rumors?”

“That you’re the King of Dublin’s underworld.” He grinned. “And that you fuck like the devil himself.”

I actually laughed. “And what did you tell her?”

“That she should be careful what she wishes for.” His expression turned serious. “She’s not one of our usual clientele, boss. She’s got that look—like she’s here to prove something to herself.”

I studied her more carefully. Italian features, probably mid-twenties, with a bone structure that belonged in Renaissance paintings. Nervous energy radiated off her in waves, but there was determination mixed with desperation.

Dangerous combination.

“She keeps looking at you,” Seamus continued. “Like she’s working up the courage to do something stupid.”

As if summoned by his words, the brunette stood up, smoothed down her dress, and walked straight toward me. Her hips swayed with each step, but her hands were trembling slightly. Whatever she was about to do, it was taking every ounce of courage she had.

“You’re him,” she said when she reached me, her accent thick and undeniably Italian. “You’re Dante Cummiskey.”

“Depends who’s asking.” I turned to face her fully, and Christ, she was even more beautiful up close. Dark eyes that reminded me of expensive coffee, skin like cream, lips that were made for sin. “And you are?”

“No one important.” She lifted her chin, trying to look confident and failing miserably. “I heard you… I heard you take women home sometimes.”

“Sometimes.” I kept my voice neutral, but inside I was fascinated. Most women who approached me here were experienced, knew exactly what they were getting into. This one looked like she’d never been in a room like this before, let alone participated in what happened here. “What exactly did you hear?”

Her cheeks flushed pink, but she didn’t back down. “That you’re into… things. Dark things.”

“I am.” I stepped closer, and she automatically stepped back until she was pressed against the bar. “The question is, mo stór, are you?”

“I want to be.”

Four words. That’s all it took to completely shift the dynamic between us. Because despite the nerves, despite the obvious inexperience, there was something in her voice that told me she meant it.

“Do you now?” I reached out, trailing one finger along her bare arm, and felt her shiver. “And what makes you think you could handle what I do to women in my bed?”

“I can handle it.” Her voice was stronger now, more determined. “I need to handle it.”

“Need to?” That was an interesting choice of words. “And why is that, love?”

Something flickered across her face—pain, anger, maybe both. “Because I’m tired of being good and proper and fucking perfect.” The curse word sounded foreign on her tongue, like she didn’t use it often. “Tonight, I want to be something else.”

I studied her face, looking for any sign that this was some kind of setup or game. But all I saw was raw honesty and a desperation that made my cock stir despite my better judgment.

“What’s your name?”

“Does it matter?”

“It does to me.”

She hesitated. “Lucia.”

Just Lucia. No last name, no details, a made up name, nothing that could identify her beyond this moment. Smart girl.

“Well then, Lucia,” I said, my voice dropping to that tone that made grown women drop to their knees. “If you come home with me tonight, you need to understand something. I don’t do gentle. I don’t do sweet. I don’t do making love.”

Her breath hitched, but she didn’t pull away.

“What I do,” I continued, leaning closer until my mouth was inches from her ear, “is bondage. I discipline. I possess. I fuck. I push limits until they break, and then I push a little further.”

“I understand.”

“You do?” I pulled back to look at her. “Once we leave this place, once I get you alone, I’ll not be asking you that. You’ll be mine for the night, completely and utterly. Your pleasure, your pain, your fucking breath—it all belongs to me until morning. And the only thing I’ll expect from you in return is submission. Utter fucking submission.”

She swallowed hard, and I could see her pulse racing in her throat. But when she spoke, her voice was steady.

“I want that.”

Christ, she was going to be the death of me.

“Then finish your drink, mo stór,” I said, signaling Seamus for the check. “Because we’re leaving. Now.”

LUCIA

⪼⚔︎♛⚔︎⪻

I’m officially damaged goods.

Fifteen minutes later, we reached Dante’s penthouse and the elevator doors slid open forty floors up. We stepped into what could only be described as… a monster’s lair.

Everything in the room was sleek, expensive, and… wrong.

The sofa looked ordinary until I noticed the iron cuffs hidden in the frame. The coffee table gleamed, but its edges were too sharp, its compartments too carefully disguised.

The paintings on the walls weren’t art. They were blasphemy scenes that would’ve made a priest faint on sight.

My throat went dry. “This is…” I struggled for the right word. “Sadistic.”

His mouth curved like he’d been waiting for me to say it. “What did you expect?”

“A normal bedroom,” I admitted, heat rising in my cheeks.

“Who said I’m normal?”

I shivered, hugging myself. What if I’d just fallen into the hands of a human trafficker?

Then his voice dropped, dark and commanding: “Take off your dress.”

The words were quiet. Absolute.

For a moment, my knees nearly buckled. I wasn’t ready. God, I wasn’t ready. But what choice did I have?

My fingers trembled as I reached behind me, tugging at the zipper. The red silk slid from my shoulders, pooled at my feet. My heart thundered so loud it drowned the silence.

His eyes devoured me. I wanted to vanish, to cover myself, but the only shield I had were my arms, and even those, he wouldn’t allow.

“Look at me, Lucia.”

I raised my head slowly. Shame and fear burned across my face, but I held his gaze anyway, because running now would mean I’d never escape tomorrow.

“You’re beautiful,” he said softly. And I hated how my chest ached at the sincerity in his voice.

Then his tone hardened. “But hiding isn’t how this works. Drop your arms.”

I froze. My arms were the last barrier between me and him. If I lowered them, I’d be exposed in a way no man had ever seen.

But slowly, painfully, I let them fall. The air touched me like a thousand eyes. My chin wobbled, but I didn’t look up.

“Better,” he murmured, stepping closer. “Why are you really here, Lucia?” he asked.

The question sliced me open. Why was I here? Because tomorrow my cage door would slam shut, and I couldn’t breathe at the thought?

“Because tomorrow my life ends,” I whispered.

“Dramatic,” he said, though his voice betrayed curiosity. “What does that mean?”

Tears pricked my eyes. “Tomorrow I’ll become someone else’s property. A stranger’s. I don’t even know his name. And once that ring is on my finger, I’ll never belong to myself again.” My lips trembled, but I forced the words out. “So tonight, just for tonight… I want to belong to someone I chose.”

He stared at me for a while, then his hands lifted to cradle my face, and the heat of them nearly undid me.

“What’s his name?” he demanded.

“I don’t know.”

“You don’t know?” His eyes flared.

“They haven’t told me yet,” I admitted, and the humiliation of it nearly cracked my voice.

Silence.

Then his thumb brushed my cheek. His tone dropped to something wicked. “Then let’s make sure your last night of freedom is one you never forget.”

He spun me toward the glass, pressing me against the window, the city glittered beneath my reflection. His hand landed on my hip—firm, claiming.

“Have you ever been tied up before, Lucia?”

My heart leapt. “N-no.”

“Has a man ever put his mouth on your cunt?”

I shook my head, shame crawling hot across my skin.

“Have you ever been fucked so hard you forgot your own name?”

“I’ve… I’ve never been fucked at all,” I whispered, so low I almost hoped he wouldn’t hear.

But he did.

He stilled behind me. For the first time, I thought I caught something almost human in his silence.

“You’re a virgin?”

“Yes.”

I waited for laughter, for mockery, for disgust. Instead, his grip tightened on my hips.

“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,” he muttered.

I swallowed, forcing my chin high. “Virginity is just another kind of perfection, isn’t it?”

His eyes burned like fire meeting gasoline. “It is, little rabbit. It is.”

# Chapter 2~ What I’ll Never Have

CHAPTER 2

LUCIA

⪼⚔︎♛⚔︎⪻

Holy Mother of God, what have I done?

Standing in the middle of Dante Cummiskey’s penthouse in nothing but scraps of black lace, I was pretty sure I’d officially lost my damn mind.

This wasn’t how I’d imagined losing my virginity. Growing up, I’d pictured candlelight and rose petals, gentle whispers of love, maybe even a wedding ring.

Not standing half-naked in a sex dungeon, with Dublin’s city lights twinkling mockingly below.

Look at the good Catholic girl about to get ruined by the King of the Underworld.

Well, fuck them. And fuck being good.

Tomorrow I’d be Mrs. Whatever-His-Name-Is, property of a man I’d never met, condemned to a lifetime of missionary position and rosary beads. So tonight I was going to sin so spectacularly that even the devil himself would be impressed.

“You’re overthinking,” Dante’s voice cut through my spiral, rich with amusement and curiosity. “I can practically hear the wheels turning.”

If only he knew what those wheels were planning.

See, here’s the thing nobody tells you about being the perfect mafia princess: you learn to be sneaky as hell. You learn to smile while plotting, to curtsy while cursing, to look innocent while planning the most beautiful revenge imaginable.

My revenge was standing six feet of dangerous temptation away from me, looking at me like I was his next meal.

Dante Lorcan Cummiskey was absolutely perfect for what I needed. Ruthless enough that he wouldn’t give a damn about consequences. Rich enough that my father couldn’t touch him. Experienced enough that he’d know exactly how to ruin me in all the right ways.

Most importantly? He was the type of man who’d disappear after one night and never look back. Perfect for a girl who wanted to leave behind a very specific type of… souvenir.

God, I hope this works.

“Come here,” he commanded, and the authority in his voice made my knees go weak. This was a man used to being obeyed, used to taking what he wanted. The complete opposite of everything I’d been raised to expect from men.

My legs moved before my brain caught up, bringing me close enough to feel his dangerous aura. Close enough to see the predatory satisfaction in those emerald eyes as he watched me submit to his command.

This is really happening.

“Do you know what you’re asking me to do to these perfect tits?” His fingers traced the edge of my bra, barely touching but making me shiver anyway.

“I know.” The lie came easily. I had no idea what he meant, but I was desperate enough to find out.

His laugh was low and rich, like expensive whiskey. “Liar. Your pulse is racing like a rabbit’s.” His thumb moved to press against the rapid flutter at my throat. “But that’s not necessarily fear, is it?”

Heat flooded my cheeks. How did he know?

“Tell me what you want, Lucia,” he commanded softly, his hand sliding down to rest at the base of my throat. Not threatening, but promising. “And don’t give me some sweet, innocent answer. Tell me what you really want.”

What did I want?

Everything. All of it. Whatever this is.

I wanted to feel alive before I died inside tomorrow. I wanted to know what it meant to burn, to ache, to come with a stranger’s fingers still inside me. I wanted to understand why grown women whispered about such things with flushed faces and secret smiles.

Most of all, I wanted to take something for myself before everything else was taken from me.

“I want…” The words stuck in my throat, a lifetime of proper breeding making it nearly impossible to voice such desires.

“You want what, love?”

His patience surprised me. I’d expected him to simply take what he wanted– that’s what men like him did, wasn’t it? But there he was, waiting to let me find my courage.

Maybe that’s why he’s so dangerous. He makes you want to give him everything.

“I want to feel,” I whispered finally. “I want to know what I’m going to be missing for the rest of my life.”

Something shifted in his expression– satisfaction, maybe, or recognition. Almost like I’d finally said something he understood.

“Then feel,” he said simply. He stepped closer, crowding me against the floor-to-ceiling windows. The glass was cold against my back. Very cold. “Problem is, you look like the type of girl who expects flowers and poetry and gentle kisses under starlight.”

My heart hammered against my ribs. “I don’t want any of that.”

“No?” His thumb brushed across my lower lip, and I had the strangest urge to bite it. “Then what do you want, mo stór? Tell me exactly.”

I want you to destroy me. I want you to ruin me so thoroughly that my future husband will know exactly what kind of woman he’s getting. I want you to put a baby in me so I can watch my father’s face when he realizes his perfect little alliance is built on a lie.

But I couldn’t say that to the arrogant sex god I was about to steal from.

“I want…” I swallowed hard, gathering every ounce of courage I possessed. “I want you to show me what I’ll never have.”

His brows lifted like he’d heard something in my voice that I hadn’t meant to reveal.

“And what makes you think you’ll never have this?” His hand slid down to rest at my throat, not squeezing but possessive. “You think your arranged husband is going to be too old to give you an orgasm?”

Clever bastard.

“That’s not—”

“Love, you’re not exactly subtle.” He leaned closer, his breath warm against my ear. “I need you to understand that I’ll kill you with the same hands I’ll use to give you multiple orgasms tonight if you intend to make me a major plot point in your Damsel In Distress life story.”

I swallowed. “What?”

His fingers traced down my throat to the swell of my breasts above my bra. “Think about that really hard while I fuck you.”

Oh.

But instead of turning around and running out of this room, I did something that surprised even me. I reached up and started unbuttoning his shirt.

His hand caught my wrist instantly, stopping me. “What are you doing?”

“What does it look like?” I tried to pull free, but his grip was iron. “You said you were going to fuck me—”

“I am.” His voice had gone dangerously soft. “But I'm a dominant. So we do this my way, at my pace. You don’t get to control anything that happens here. Understood?”

I nodded once.

“By letting me fuck you, you’ll be agreeing to becoming my submissive for the night.”

I nodded again.

He shook his head. “That’s not enough. I need you to sign an NDA stating that I have your consent.”

My jaw dropped. “A legal contract just to have sex?”

He backed away towards a drawer, eyes still holding mine, and produced a single file and a biro which he held out in front of me. “You don’t have to read it. Just sign.”

Holding his eyes, I took the biro and drew a simple ‘Lucia’ across the required space before handing it back to him.

He smirked. “Good girl.”

A thrill shot through me at his words, equal parts terror and excitement. “I’m very curious now. Kiss me.”

For a moment, he just stared at me. Then his mouth curved in a smile that was pure predator. “Save your lips for your husband,” he said, and my heart plummeted. “I don’t do kisses.”

No. No, no, no.

Panic flooded through me. If he didn’t kiss, what else didn’t he do? What if he insisted on protection? What if he was one of those careful men who thought everything through? My entire plan would crumble before it even began.

“I’m very clean,” I began. “I’m AA. No STDs. Blood type O. No previous sex partners. HIV negative. No Herpes. I could show you all the test results if you’d just let me get my phone from my purse. I swear I’m very…”

“Not interested.” His hands moved to my shoulders, turning me to face the window. I could see our reflection in the glass—him fully clothed and in control, me barely dressed and completely at his mercy. “You want to know what you’ll be missing? Then shut up and let me show you.”

His hands skimmed down my sides, and I shivered at the contact. This was nothing like the fumbling touches and the few chaste pecks I’d experienced with my late fiancé under my father’s watchful eye.

“Has anyone ever touched you like this?” His fingers traced the edge of my panties, not quite where I needed them but close enough to make me gasp.

“No.” The word came out strangled.

“Good.” There was satisfaction in his voice, dark and possessive. “I like being first.”

If only you knew just how many firsts you’re going to be.

His hand slipped beneath the lace, and I nearly jumped out of my skin at the contact. I’d touched myself before—what girl hadn’t?—but having someone else’s hands on me was an entirely different experience.

“Jesus, you’re responsive,” he murmured, and I could hear the smile in his voice. “I’ve barely touched you and you’re already trembling.”

I wanted to say something clever, something that would make me seem less pathetically innocent, but then his fingers moved in a way that made coherent thought impossible.

Oh. Oh my.

This was what all the whispers were about. This was why married women got that secretive look when they thought no one was watching. This was what I’d been missing, locked away in my ivory tower of virtue and propriety.

“Stop thinking,” Dante murmured against my ear, his free hand moving to brace against the window beside my head. “Just feel.”

But I couldn’t stop thinking.

With his eyes solely holding my gaze, he shifted my panties aside and flicked a single finger over my already sloppy clit. The gasp that escaped my lips made him raise a single brow.

“Either you find me extremely hot, which is weird considering I’m still dressed, or you’re just a natural creamer.” He grinned, ""Whichever it is, rest assured I’m going to enjoy ruining this pussy.”

Is this what it feels like to burn?

Wait. What was I burning from? Embarrassment, shame, or desire?

# Chapter 3~ Begged Me To Ruin Her

CHAPTER 3

DANTE

⪼⚔︎♛⚔︎⪻

She was a fucking contradiction wrapped in black lace.

Standing there against my windows like some fallen angel, all trembling innocence and desperate courage. She’d practically begged me to ruin her, and Christ, I was more than willing to oblige.

But watching her now, pulse hammering in that delicate throat, eyes wide with want and terror, I found myself wanting to take my time with her corruption.

Too bad the universe had other fucking plans.

“You’re thinking again,” I murmured as I let my fingers trace the edge of her panties. The little gasp she made went straight to my cock. “Didn’t I tell you to stop that?”

“I can’t help it.” Her voice was breathless and honest. Most women who ended up in my bed knew how to perform, knew exactly what sounds to make and when. But Lucia was real. Raw.

Dangerous as fuck.

“What’s going through that pretty head of yours?”

She turned to meet my eyes in the reflection, and the honesty there nearly undid me. “I’m thinking about what you’re going to do to me.”

“And?”

“It feels too good.” The admission came out like a confession, and I felt my control slip another notch. “Even the parts that scare me.”

Jesus. When was the last time a woman had admitted to being scared of me while simultaneously begging for more? When was the last time I’d cared what they were thinking about while I fucked them senseless?

My hand moved against her clit, drawing another sweet little moan from those perfect lips. “You should be scared, love. I’m not known for being gentle with my toys.”

“I don’t want gentle.” She pressed back against me, and the trust in that simple movement made my chest tight. “I want—”

The sound of my private elevator engaging made her eyes go wide with fear.

I stopped.

Only three people had access to that lift. My housekeeper, Mrs. O’Brien, who was visiting her grandchildren in Cork. My driver, Tommy, who was currently parked outside with strict orders to stay put until I called. And my second-in-command, who knew better than to interrupt me unless the world was literally on fire.

“Fuck.” I stepped back from Lucia, already reaching for a gun. “Get dressed. Now.”

“What?” She spun around, confusion and hurt flickering across her flushed features. “What’s wrong?”

The elevator doors chimed open, and Cian O’Sullivan’s voice echoed through my penthouse like a gunshot in a cathedral.

“Dante! Where the hell are you, brother?”

I’d known Cian since we were fifteen, running numbers in the slums of Ballymun. Been through three wars and a dozen smaller conflicts with him watching my back. I’d heard him angry, desperate, even scared. But I’d never heard him sound like this.

1p9e22c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1p9e22c/i_woke_up_to_find_my_stepfather_in_my_bed/,I woke up to find my stepfather in my bed,"I woke up to find my stepfather in my bed.   
Not by accident. Not by mistake. On purpose.   
Lazzaro Rosetti is everything I hate—arrogant, cruel, and way too hot for his own good.   
He married my mom in a cold, arranged marriage。  
And from day one, he's made it his mission to torment me.   
He corners me in hallways. Smirks when I stutter.   
Grabs my ankle and won't let go just to watch me squirm.   
But tonight, he crossed a line I didn't even know existed.   
He slipped into my bed in the dead of night, pulled me against his arm, and whispered in my ear like the devil himself.   
""Ride my fingers.""   
I should have screamed. I should have run.   
Instead, I came. Three times.   
And when I woke up the next morning, there was a heart drawn in his cum on my sheets—  
A filthy little love note only I would understand.   
Now I'm trapped in a house with a man who hates my family, craves my body.  
And won't stop until he owns every last piece of me.   
The worst part? I think I want him to.  
  
My eyes snap open, and a scream rises up my throat.   
  
Every muscle in my body goes rigid, and terror claws at my heart. Please let this be a dream. A nightmare.  
  
Directly in front of me is the floor-to-ceiling mirror on the front of my wardrobe, and I stare into my own wide-eyed, terror-stricken reflection. My cheek is pressed into the pillow, and the white ruffled strap of my pajama top has slipped down. A shaft of silver moonlight falls across my comforter, and the clock on my bedside table ticks out every agonizing second. It's nearly one in the morning. The witching hour?  
  
More like the devil's hour.  
  
And the devil's in my bed.  
  
A large, muscular figure is cloaked in darkness. He shifts with a sleepy murmur, and the sheer size of him rocks my whole body. His head is behind mine on the pillow, and I can see little of him except for the dark, silky hair falling across his forehead and the sleeve of his black T-shirt stretched tight around his muscular bicep.  
  
This man is huge. Tall and built like a linebacker. The first time I laid eyes on him, I thought he was uncomfortably, aggressively large, and I still think that every time he walks into a room. I feel like I'm sharing this usually generous bed with a nine-foot demon from HELL. His body heat is scorching the backs of my bare legs, and my normally sweet-smelling bedroom is filled with an invasive masculine scent.  
  
I hate this man in the daylight, and I fear him at night. I can't stand him looking at me or even breathing near me, and I absolutely loathe the sensation of his body brushing against mine. Every second of every day, I'm trying to avoid his massive body in the kitchen or ignore the way he glares at me across the dining table. The last place he should be is in my bed. We're not lovers.  
  
We're not even friends.  
  
Lazzaro Rosetti is Mom's twenty-nine-year-old husband, a grade-A asshole, and my new stepfather.  
  
I angle my chin up and sniff the air, trying to catch the scent of alcohol, which might explain why Lazzaro has mistaken my bedroom for the one he shares with Mom, but there's nothing but the aroma of his cologne. I say ""shares,"" but my new stepfather is unpredictable, coming in and out of the house at all hours of the day and night. He's more like a restless animal than a man. Sometimes I catch him sleeping on the sofa or on a deck chair out by the pool. One morning last week, he was sleeping on the living room floor, and I stepped over him on my way to the kitchen. Lazzaro came suddenly alive, grabbing my ankle and refusing to let go as I squealed and tried to shake him off. His grip was an iron manacle, and his green eyes flashed with malice. All the while, he was grinning like this was a game to him.  
  
I managed to kick him in the ribs with my sneaker, and he grunted in pain. Still grinning, he yanked me closer so he could take his revenge by looking up my skirt.  
  
Lazzaro gazed up at me from the floor. ""Mm, white lace. My favorite.""  
  
Cheeks blazing with humiliation, I shoved my skirt between my legs. ""You asshole.""  
  
Mom's footsteps could be heard coming down the sweeping marble stairs, and Lazzaro let go of me so fast that I stumbled. By the time she came into the kitchen with a crimson-and-gold silk robe hanging from her elegant shoulders, he was leaning against the kitchen counter, waiting for the coffee machine to finish dispensing a double shot of Colombian roast.  
  
I found my voice a few seconds later. ""Mom, Lazzaro just grabbed me, and he wouldn't let go.""  
  
Lazzaro passed the coffee to Mom, no cream or sugar, just how she likes it. She stared in confusion at his out-of-character thoughtful gesture but then accepted the cup.  
  
""Mia stumbled and I didn't want her to fall and hurt herself,"" he explained mildly.  
  
""That's not what—""  
  
Mom winced and pinched her brow. ""Mia, please keep your voice down. I just woke up. And next time, look where you're going.""  
  
Lazzaro folded his arms and smirked at me behind his wife's back.  
  
Mom pushed out through the double doors to drink her coffee in the garden. She didn't look at me once. Mom almost never looks at me.  
  
After all these years, you'd think I'd be used to it, but it still hurts being the Bianchi family's shame. Mom's face falls or her eyes skim over me whenever I walk into a room. Grandmother flinches whenever I speak at the dinner table. My three uncles give me stony glares before kissing my older sisters hello warmly.  
  
A vicious whisper sounded in my ear. ""So, it's true. No one believes a single word out of your mouth.""  
  
Lazzaro was standing right behind me. He was so close that I could see every detail of the scar that cuts vertically through his lips on the left-hand side. It gives him a dangerous, roguish appearance, especially when he smiles and bares his strong white teeth.  
  
His vindictive mouth whispered, ""Or maybe it's just that they don't care what you have to say, and never have.""  
  
Now he's in my bed, and I don't know if it's a mistake or on purpose. But I'm not sticking around to find out. I grasp the edge of the mattress and wriggle my way toward it, staring at our reflections in the mirror and hoping I don't wake him.  
  
Lazzaro's eyes pop open. I catch the feral gleam of his green gaze in the darkness, and my stomach swoops. A slow, nasty smile spreads over his face.  
  
He's not confused.  
  
He knows exactly whose bed he's in.  
  
I want to scream, but I don't, because eighteen years on this earth has taught me that no matter what goes wrong, it's always my fault.   
  
If Mom runs in here, Lazzaro will protest that he made an honest mistake.   
  
Mom will tell me I'm attention-seeking, and I'll end up being forced to apologize for causing drama in the middle of the night. I'd rather gargle hot sauce and toilet cleaner than say sorry to this man.  
  
""What are you doing in my room?"" I hiss, holding tight to the blankets.  
  
""Your mom's pissing me off.""  
  
When are they not pissing each other off? Every time they fight, I'm the one who pays for it. Mom walks around slamming doors and shouting. Lazzaro finds me and destroys whatever peace I've found watching TV, swimming in the pool, or reading in the garden.  
  
""Then go and sleep on the sofa.""  
  
""But I like your bed.""  
  
""Then I'll go sleep on the sofa.""  
  
But Lazzaro grabs the back of my pajama top as I try to get out of bed. ""Running off? So rude when I'm being nice to you.""  
  
""How is this nice?"" I exclaim in an outraged whisper.  
  
""Did anyone else talk to you today?""  
  
Tonight, Uncle Tomaso and Aunt Sofia came to dinner with their children, two cousins who are older than me and another who is younger. At one point, I asked one of my cousins how school was going. Aunt Sofia immediately talked over me and changed the subject.  
  
""Screw you,"" I whisper, shuddering with anger and humiliation.  
  
Lazzaro slides an arm beneath me and drags me back against his arms. ""Cold? I'll warm you up.""  
  
His searing hot flesh presses against my back, scorching me from the nape of my neck to my heels. I struggle to get out of his grip, but both of his arms come around me. One of his hands is on my waist and the other is on my bare inner thigh. He's wearing sweats, but as his hips press into me, I feel the telltale ridge of something hard and thick against my butt.  
  
Panicked words fall from my lips. ""What the... is that your... Oh, my God.""  
  
""What's what?"" Lazzaro speaks directly into my ear, his deep voice rumbly and tinged with lust and amusement. I dig my nails into his muscular forearms and grit my teeth against the restless, fluttering feeling low in my belly. He gets off on tormenting me, and he's made that clear from day one. The moment he crossed the threshold into this house after their honeymoon, his expression dark with anger and every muscle bunched beneath his black T-shirt, he zeroed in on me. Someone was going to suffer for what he'd been forced to do, and I'm his perfect victim.  
  
No, it started before that day. Our eyes met at the church altar and his gaze fell to my nip//ples, which were pebbled into points and painfully obvious through my pink satin bridesmaid gown. It was so cold in the church, they were practically visible from space.  
  
The priest prompted him to say his vows, and he lifted his eyes to mine as he spoke the words, I do.  
  
Like a curse.  
  
Like a threat.  
  
""Why are you torturing me like this? What did I ever do to you?""  
  
In our reflections, Lazzaro's eyes narrow with spite. ""It's nothing personal, Mia. I just hate your family.""  
  
He didn't want to marry Mom, and Mom didn't want to marry him, but it was arranged by our families like something out of the Middle Ages. The Rosetti family wants to force Lazzaro to settle down, and Mom wants some of the power and money that the Rosetti men wield like weapons in this city. Absolutely nothing about their marriage has to do with love. It's pure business.  
  
I lie still for a moment, letting Lazzaro think he's won whatever sick game he's playing. He reaches up and palms one of my bre//asts like he owns it. And pleasure courses through me.  
  
I ram my elbow into Lazzaro's stomach and fling myself off the bed.   
  
""Ah-ah, Mia,"" he taunts. ""Can't have you roaming the house in the middle of the night. Good girls stay in bed.""  
  
I growl with frustration as loud as I dare. ""I hate you,"" I seethe, wrenching myself back and forth in his iron-like grip.  
  
""I hate you more.""  
  
I buck in his arms until his hand lands on my intimacy and his fingers curl to cup my se//x over my pajama shorts. I inhale sharply. ""What are you doing?""  
  
""Ride my fingers.""  
  
""Go to HELL,"" I say through gritted teeth. My whole body is rigid as I wait for him to continue my humiliation. To grow bolder. To become an even worse man by invading my clothing. But Lazzaro doesn't move. Instead, he laughs softly, and I see in our reflection that he closes his eyes and relaxes.  
  
""Whatever. They're there if you need them.""  
  
And Lazzaro goes to sleep, leaving his fingers right where they are, tucked against my se//x. My heart pounds, and my heart feels like it's about to explode. I take as deep a breath as I can, locked in the cage of Lazzaro's arms. I'll wait until he's asleep and then get the hell out of here.  
  
My eyes focus on our reflection. I'm flat-che//sted and straight-waisted, and I have never felt sexy. But I look different in Lazzaro's big arms with his muscular forearm draped around my middle, and I feel a little bit precious with his sleep-softened face pressed into the side of my neck. He looks as rough and scary as always, but the way he's curled around me seems... protective. Possessive.  
  
Like I'm wanted for a change.  
  
My gaze sweeps down his body, from the hard planes of his face and jaw to his shoulder looming over mine.   
  
The bumps of his ribs beneath his T-shirt and the inch of warm, tanned skin where his top has ridden up his belly.   
  
Lazzaro always looks too big to be allowed, but right now his bigness seems just right. My heart pounds and my stomach is alive with fluttering. I shift slightly in his arms and feel the unmistakable sensation of wetness between my legs and against his fingers through my thin cotton shorts.  
  
And because I'm wet and slippery, the pressure of his fingers against my cl//it feels amazing. Lazzaro is the biggest asshole I've ever met, but he's also stupidly hot, and I hate him even more because of it. Every time he smirks at me, I can tell he's thinking how great he is.  
  
Barely realizing I'm doing it, I rotate my hips in slow circles. My eyes drift closed as the tiny movements cause a tidal wave of sensation to crash through me. I've masturbated plenty of times before, and the results have been swift but unsatisfying. Mechanically, everything works as it's supposed to, but something was always missing.  
  
Someone to fantasize about.  
  
My eyes snap open and fasten on Lazzaro's sleeping face. Mom's husband is not the object of my desires. That's just sick. But he is aggressively masculine and smells like sin, two things I crave, apparently, because my hips are still moving on their own. Back and forth on Lazzaro's fingers. I let out a soft pant as the sensations kick up a notch.  
  
I'll stop.  
  
I will.  
  
This is so screwed up and wrong.  
  
But so is he for coming in here.  
  
Lazzaro's arms are painfully tight around me, and his hard-on is wedged tight in my butt. The room is dark, and my core is so molten hot that reality starts to slide out of my grasp. There's just pleasure and a man's strong fingers against my intimacy, and the memory of his sultry voice breathing in my ear, Ride my fingers.  
  
I let out the tiniest of whimpers, but Lazzaro's breathing stays deep and even. He has no idea what's happening, and I'm close—so close—and I can't make myself stop. It's never felt this good before, and I have to discover what's waiting for me on the other side of this delicious feeling.  
  
Just a little more... just a little more... I want... I need...  
  
Heat and pleasure rise up and crash over me. My body flexes in Lazzaro's strong arms as I hurtle beyond all conscious thought and straight into pure pleasure.  
  
That was better than anything I've felt in my entire life.  
  
I drew in a deep breath and open my eyes.  
  
Lazzaro is awake and staring at me, his expression absolutely feral.  
  
Fear lashes through me, and I yelp, grabbing hold of his taut forearms and clinging to him, even though he's the one I'm afraid of.  
  
""I wasn't..."" I start to say in a high-pitched, panicked voice.  
  
With a growl, Lazzaro rolls on top of me. His bulk pins me face first to the mattress and his hot breath seethes in my ear. ""Again.""  
  
My eyes open wide. With his feet, he forces my legs open and thrusts his hips down, pushing my intimacy against his fingers.  
  
""What? No—""  
  
My intimacy rolls against his hand, and I moan as pure pleasure builds inside me again. He keeps rhythmically thrusting himself against my butt while he moves his fingers in a come here motion.  
  
""Stop that,"" I buzz angrily into the mattress. I try to buck him off, but he's too heavy, and I only succeed in working myself harder against his fingers. I can't possibly come again. Not so soon. Surely bodies aren't built that way, but to my horror, heat and pleasure are mounting within me. I feel him through layers of fabric like we're completely bare. His c0ck against my butt. His fingers on my intimacy. He's breathing hard in my ear like we really are screwing.  
  
""Come on, Mia. Show me how bad girls get off in the middle of the night.""  
  
""I'm going to kill... ahh."" To my shame, everything down there suddenly tightens up and bursts gloriously apart.  
  
""Again,"" he orders, before I can even draw breath back into my searing lungs. A threat. A brutal demand.  
  
A third time? I couldn't. My se//x is oversensitized and his touch sends bolts of pleasure-pain coursing through me. I writhe against his hand, practically crying. Wishing it would stop but needing it to go on. I can't think, can't breathe. There's only me and him and I've never felt so gloriously out of control.  
  
""Do as you're told, Mia. I'm not letting you up until you come again.""  
  
Lazzaro thrusts hard against my butt through his sweats and his hot breath is on the back of my neck. The hottest man I've ever laid eyes on has me pinned in place, and my body craves to give him what he wants. His brutal assault on my senses forces a third orgasm from me.  
  
I press my face into the pillow and moan, wishing it didn't feel so good to be so thoroughly humiliated.  
  
My stepfather raggedly breathes into my ear, ""Good girl.""",1,1764385686.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

We’re building something new called Popera and wanted to bring it here because Reddit is one of the last places where people give real, unfiltered feedback. If something is great, you say it. If something is terrible, you definitely say it. That is exactly what we need right now.

Popera started from a simple observation we kept seeing over and over. People want to meet in real life, but every existing tool feels way too big, too formal, or too disconnected from how humans actually gather. Most people do not want to plan an “event.” They just want to bring people together without friction.

So we built Popera to make gathering feel human again. Anyone can host a micro pop-up anywhere. A café. A park. A living room. A studio. A backyard. Whatever space feels natural. Every pop-up automatically gets its own group chat so people can talk, warm up, and connect before they ever show up. It takes away the awkwardness and makes things feel alive before the moment even begins.

The way we think about it is simple  
“Bring your crowd anywhere.”  
That crowd might be three close friends or a whole community of three hundred. Both matter.

The early version is now live and fully working. It gives people the ability to create or join small pop-ups in seconds. But this is the stage where real feedback matters most. We want early users to poke at it, try it, break it, and tell us what needs to be improved. What feels confusing. What feels great. What feels missing.

Here is the link if you want to try it: gopopera/ca

On Popera you can  
Create a free pop-up  
Join any event  
Talk in the group chat  
Save things you like  
Host something tiny like a coffee meetup or a board game night or a mini market  
Share your honest feedback so we can keep improving

We’re not here to sell anything. We genuinely want Popera to be shaped by the people who use it, not by our assumptions. This is an early community project and we want Reddit’s voice in it.

If you try it and have any thoughts at all, bugs, ideas, requests, or just impressions, you can comment here or message us directly. We’re building Popera day by day and your feedback truly affects what gets built next.

Thanks for reading and thank you in advance to anyone who tries it. If even one person here ends up hosting a tiny pop-up because of this post, that will already make our week.",0,1764385655.0,SmallBusinessCanada,0,0.5,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Loyola Marymount Lions vs. Stony Brook Seawolves: A Statistical Slaughterhouse or a Three-Point Parade?**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a basketball spectacle where Loyola Marymount’s defense is about to play *Whack-a-Mole* with Stony Brook’s hopes, and the Seawolves’ three-pointers will either be a tidal wave or a puddle of regret. Let’s dive into the numbers, news, and nonsense.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Your Grandma Could Predict This

Loyola Marymount (-9.5 to -11.0) is being handed odds that make a Tesla look like a horse and buggy. At decimal prices of 1.15–1.24, the implied probability of an LMU win ranges from **83% to 89%**—which is about the same chance of me *not* making a dad joke in this analysis (spoiler: I failed). Stony Brook’s longshots (5.3–5.75) imply a **17%–20%** chance, which is roughly the odds your local coffee shop runs out of decaf on a Monday.

The spread? A brutal -9.5 to -11.0 for LMU, meaning bookmakers think this game will be less of a contest and more of a *math quiz*. If you bet Stony Brook, you’re essentially saying, “I trust these guys to shoot 9.6 threes *and* outrun Loyola’s defense, which allows 17.8 points fewer per game than Stony Brook’s meager 9.2 edge.” Good luck with that.

---

### Statistical Shenanigans: Defense Wins Championships (and This Game)

Loyola Marymount’s defense is tighter than a nun’s budget during tax season. They’re allowing a measly **64.6 points per game**, holding opponents to **38% shooting**—a number so low, it makes Stony Brook’s allowed **41%** look like a free-throw contest. Meanwhile, LMU’s offense is a well-oiled machine, shooting **49.6% from the field** (8.6% better than Stony Brook’s defense can handle).

Stony Brook’s pride? Their three-pointers. They’re nailing **9.6 per game**, which is **2.6 more** than LMU allows. But here’s the catch: LMU’s defense is so good, they’d make Steph Curry question his life choices. The Lions are third in the West Coast Conference in scoring defense, while Stony Brook is second in the CAA in *allowing* points. Translation: The Seawolves’ “strength” is about to be

The total staff is about 10 between the two stores. I do the closing shift 1-10, 1-6, 12:30-8 depending on the day and store. 

I dont want to get into the entire lore but to make it brief: the closer is expected to leave on time. The owner does not pay you if you stay pass the closing shift time. They expect you to be able to get everything done within the time frame. 

I've been working here almost 2 years. Some days I would get out on time. Other days I would be there 20-40 minutes after. 

Me and the owner got into an argument because they told me I was doing too many closing things early. We went back and forth and I told them that this was unreasonable and I was doing too much unpaid labor and me doing things early was me trying to do get out on time. Eventually I told him that I would call him and decide if I wanted to continue this job or not ( we said a lot more to eachother but I am shortening). 

I called and left a message and told him next week would be my last week. He has not called me back. I went into the store to check the schedule and I am already scheduled. I also have shifts this weekend ( Sat+ Sunday). 

I'm debating if I should just ghost. I wrote down pros and cons 

Pros: 

Winter has officially started. Its snowing outside and its cold. I dont want to be there until 10 pm and I can be in my bed 

I dont need to use this store as a reference. I have savings to last me about 2 months and will be going back to uni in Jan and will have my student loans. Money will be tight and I will have to look for another job but I will be okay for a while. 

I did so much unpaid labor for this store cause I was desperate for a job and couldn't just quit, it honestly made me bitter. 

I dont have to deal with the awkward week before leaving. I wish the owner would have just called me back, I called him yesterday at 1pm and I'm being petty but I find it rude. 

Cons: 

- if I do a no show then it will fall on my coworkers to pick up the slack. One of them will have to stay to cover my shifts. 

- its the holiday season, people have booked days off and I'm bringing additional stress 

- I probably wont come and pick up my last cheque. It'll be too awkward. 

- leaving on bad terms will never see these ppl again but they might call the police. The address they have isn't even correct on file cause I never updated it. One coworker does know I might be ghosting because I told her so she might say something. ",4,1764385424.0,antiwork,7,1.0,False

Despite being vegan for several years now, I find it hard to incorporate fruits and vegetables in my diet so smoothies are my best bet - however, I don’t own a blender and the last time I did, it was impossible to clean.

So, I’m looking for any store bought brands that sell bottled smoothies, preferably with recyclable bottles and that do not contain banana.

Literally every smoothie I’ve seen in Tesco contains banana and I’m devastated by it because the only way to get a smoothie without banana right now is to pay extortionate prices at coffee shops.

If there’s nothing I’ll also take recommendations for blenders that are INSANELY EASY to clean because I don’t have a lot of energy and doing the dishes already is a nightmare.",2,1764385383.0,veganuk,1,1.0,False

I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. 

I’m 27 and the youngest manager at my company that I started at 3 months ago. one of the girl in my crew is 23 and everything started professionally. I never saw her in that way and didn’t even try because I read all the stories here of dating coworkers . One day we had to ride together and found out we both like the same things and grew up in the same area before moving to other cities. 

We started off texting through the company phones then switched to personal. Before that she has already shown interest in me by flirting. Now we’ll get coffee and some times lunch together but outside of work we have never hung out even though I have asked but she always says she’s busy. On her way home we’ll talk through the phone and before work. Then some times before she goes to bed and we’ll text no stop. 

She has never asked me to do anything for her from my role and I have never helped her in anyway or given her preference. The other day she asked me how I felt about her and I told her I thought she was cool and wanted to see where things go, her reply was “no comment” with laughing faces, I was like wait what the hell. The day before I saw her looking at me from across the office and I asked her later that day why and she said she was dogging me for talking to the delivery girl but she said she was joking? 

I have analyzed the whole thing and I feel I fucked up. I feel now she was just using me for attention at work, and I feel stupid. at this point I don’t know how to end this and I should’ve been more professional cause of my role. I haven’t had a good night sleep in two days just thinking of how to end this, because the past couple days I’ve tried ignoring her she always calls me or texts me why I’m mad or what’s wrong. 

I’m not sure if I should ask her what she really wants and if she’s serious I can transfer to our other branches down the road or she can. Or just try to ghost her as much as possible. ",1,1764385328.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

I figured I’d put everything here and hope some of you can steer me in the right direction. I’m very much learning as I go, so feel free to point things out if I’m doing something completely backwards.

1) Timemore C3s ESP Pro:what grind setting works for AeroPress?

My mom brought me a Timemore C3s ESP Pro from the States. Great gift, but of course it wasn’t the exact model I asked for (asked for a C3s). Anyway, I can’t figure out the grind range for AeroPress on this thing. There’s barely anything online about this specific grinder. If anyone owns it or knows the click range that roughly corresponds to medium-fine, please help me out.


2) My brother sent some coffee beans but I’m not sure how they’re “supposed” to taste

He sent me:
	Guatemala Antigua
	French Vanilla (flavoured)

I can taste a huge difference compared to instant, but I don’t know if I’m actually brewing them well or just randomly getting lucky. If it helps, I don’t mind posting a video of my routine.Recently i played with the grind settings and found out in two different settings that the coffee tasted sour and bitter respectively 

Also, I’m thinking of asking him to send more beans from Central Market Organics or other brand roasters. If anyone knows good ones from there, I’m open to suggestions.


3) How do you experiment with an AeroPress without drinking a ridiculous amount of coffee?

My usual brew is:
	18g coffee
	200 ml water
      85–90°C
	Bloom: around 30 sec
	Steep: around 45–60 sec

I want to experiment more, but I don’t know how people test different recipes without ending up….overcaffeinated and vibrating. How do you pace it or structure it so you can compare brews properly?


4) If I want to add milk… do I add it to the whole brew or only part of it?

Like if I want something milk based, am I supposed to:
	Brew normally and add milk to all 200 ml?
	Brew something stronger and only mix part of it with milk?

And if anyone has tips on making AeroPress versions of lattes/flat whites/etc., I’d appreciate it…..I’m basically clueless there.


5) Is it normal for the grinder to feel like it gets “stuck” on finer settings?

When I grind finer, the handle sometimes catches or feels like it’s stuck for a second. Is this normal for hand grinders, or should I worry?


Thanks in advance to anyone who replies! I’m just trying to learn without wasting beans or driving myself insane, so any advice helps.

I’m the founder of a new local project called **Popera**, and I wanted to share it here because Reddit has always been the place where real people tell you the truth, good or bad.

Popera is basically my attempt to solve something I’ve seen again and again:  
**people want to gather in real life, but the tools to actually** ***make it happen*** **always feel way too big, too formal, or too disconnected.**

We built Popera to make it *stupidly simple* for anyone, creators, friends, small sellers, local organizers and even regular people to host **micro pop-ups** anywhere: cafés, parks, living rooms, studios, anywhere that feels human. And every pop-up gets its own **group chat**, so people can talk, warm up, and connect *before* they ever show up.

Think of it as:  
**“Bring your crowd anywhere.”**  
Whether that crowd is 3 people or 300.

We just released our early version and it’s live, it works but now we need honest early users to poke at it, try hosting something small, and tell us what sucks, what feels good, and what’s missing.

Here’s the link if you want to try it: [**https://gopopera.ca**](https://gopopera.ca?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

You can:

* Create a free pop-up
* Join any event
* Chat with the group
* Favorite things
* Host something tiny (a coffee meetup, a mini-market, a board game night… anything)
* And give me real feedback so I can fix what needs fixing

I’m not here to sell anything, I’m here because I genuinely want Popera to become something shaped by the people who actually use it, not by my assumptions.

  
If you try it and have **any** feedback (bugs, ideas, missing features, confusing UX, whatever) you can comment here or DM us. We're building this day by day, and your input literally changes the product.

Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance if you help out.  
If even one of you hosts a tiny pop-up because of this post, it will make our week!",1,1764385182.0,OttawaMusic,0,0.67,False

Here are four real-world shifts our players experienced when they made the switch to a crypto casino:

No bank statements, no 72-hour review. **Total time: 15 minutes.** Alex used that money to book a spontaneous weekend trip.

1p9dv71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1p9dv71/i_woke_up_to_find_my_stepfather_in_my_bed/,I woke up to find my stepfather in my bed,"I woke up to find my stepfather in my bed.   
Not by accident. Not by mistake. On purpose.   
Lazzaro Rosetti is everything I hate—arrogant, cruel, and way too hot for his own good.   
He married my mom in a cold, arranged marriage。  
And from day one, he's made it his mission to torment me.   
He corners me in hallways. Smirks when I stutter.   
Grabs my ankle and won't let go just to watch me squirm.   
But tonight, he crossed a line I didn't even know existed.   
He slipped into my bed in the dead of night, pulled me against his arm, and whispered in my ear like the devil himself.   
""Ride my fingers.""   
I should have screamed. I should have run.   
Instead, I came. Three times.   
And when I woke up the next morning, there was a heart drawn in his cum on my sheets—  
A filthy little love note only I would understand.   
Now I'm trapped in a house with a man who hates my family, craves my body.  
And won't stop until he owns every last piece of me.   
The worst part? I think I want him to.  
  
My eyes snap open, and a scream rises up my throat.   
  
Every muscle in my body goes rigid, and terror claws at my heart. Please let this be a dream. A nightmare.  
  
Directly in front of me is the floor-to-ceiling mirror on the front of my wardrobe, and I stare into my own wide-eyed, terror-stricken reflection. My cheek is pressed into the pillow, and the white ruffled strap of my pajama top has slipped down. A shaft of silver moonlight falls across my comforter, and the clock on my bedside table ticks out every agonizing second. It's nearly one in the morning. The witching hour?  
  
More like the devil's hour.  
  
And the devil's in my bed.  
  
A large, muscular figure is cloaked in darkness. He shifts with a sleepy murmur, and the sheer size of him rocks my whole body. His head is behind mine on the pillow, and I can see little of him except for the dark, silky hair falling across his forehead and the sleeve of his black T-shirt stretched tight around his muscular bicep.  
  
This man is huge. Tall and built like a linebacker. The first time I laid eyes on him, I thought he was uncomfortably, aggressively large, and I still think that every time he walks into a room. I feel like I'm sharing this usually generous bed with a nine-foot demon from HELL. His body heat is scorching the backs of my bare legs, and my normally sweet-smelling bedroom is filled with an invasive masculine scent.  
  
I hate this man in the daylight, and I fear him at night. I can't stand him looking at me or even breathing near me, and I absolutely loathe the sensation of his body brushing against mine. Every second of every day, I'm trying to avoid his massive body in the kitchen or ignore the way he glares at me across the dining table. The last place he should be is in my bed. We're not lovers.  
  
We're not even friends.  
  
Lazzaro Rosetti is Mom's twenty-nine-year-old husband, a grade-A asshole, and my new stepfather.  
  
I angle my chin up and sniff the air, trying to catch the scent of alcohol, which might explain why Lazzaro has mistaken my bedroom for the one he shares with Mom, but there's nothing but the aroma of his cologne. I say ""shares,"" but my new stepfather is unpredictable, coming in and out of the house at all hours of the day and night. He's more like a restless animal than a man. Sometimes I catch him sleeping on the sofa or on a deck chair out by the pool. One morning last week, he was sleeping on the living room floor, and I stepped over him on my way to the kitchen. Lazzaro came suddenly alive, grabbing my ankle and refusing to let go as I squealed and tried to shake him off. His grip was an iron manacle, and his green eyes flashed with malice. All the while, he was grinning like this was a game to him.  
  
I managed to kick him in the ribs with my sneaker, and he grunted in pain. Still grinning, he yanked me closer so he could take his revenge by looking up my skirt.  
  
Lazzaro gazed up at me from the floor. ""Mm, white lace. My favorite.""  
  
Cheeks blazing with humiliation, I shoved my skirt between my legs. ""You asshole.""  
  
Mom's footsteps could be heard coming down the sweeping marble stairs, and Lazzaro let go of me so fast that I stumbled. By the time she came into the kitchen with a crimson-and-gold silk robe hanging from her elegant shoulders, he was leaning against the kitchen counter, waiting for the coffee machine to finish dispensing a double shot of Colombian roast.  
  
I found my voice a few seconds later. ""Mom, Lazzaro just grabbed me, and he wouldn't let go.""  
  
Lazzaro passed the coffee to Mom, no cream or sugar, just how she likes it. She stared in confusion at his out-of-character thoughtful gesture but then accepted the cup.  
  
""Mia stumbled and I didn't want her to fall and hurt herself,"" he explained mildly.  
  
""That's not what—""  
  
Mom winced and pinched her brow. ""Mia, please keep your voice down. I just woke up. And next time, look where you're going.""  
  
Lazzaro folded his arms and smirked at me behind his wife's back.  
  
Mom pushed out through the double doors to drink her coffee in the garden. She didn't look at me once. Mom almost never looks at me.  
  
After all these years, you'd think I'd be used to it, but it still hurts being the Bianchi family's shame. Mom's face falls or her eyes skim over me whenever I walk into a room. Grandmother flinches whenever I speak at the dinner table. My three uncles give me stony glares before kissing my older sisters hello warmly.  
  
A vicious whisper sounded in my ear. ""So, it's true. No one believes a single word out of your mouth.""  
  
Lazzaro was standing right behind me. He was so close that I could see every detail of the scar that cuts vertically through his lips on the left-hand side. It gives him a dangerous, roguish appearance, especially when he smiles and bares his strong white teeth.  
  
His vindictive mouth whispered, ""Or maybe it's just that they don't care what you have to say, and never have.""  
  
Now he's in my bed, and I don't know if it's a mistake or on purpose. But I'm not sticking around to find out. I grasp the edge of the mattress and wriggle my way toward it, staring at our reflections in the mirror and hoping I don't wake him.  
  
Lazzaro's eyes pop open. I catch the feral gleam of his green gaze in the darkness, and my stomach swoops. A slow, nasty smile spreads over his face.  
  
He's not confused.  
  
He knows exactly whose bed he's in.  
  
I want to scream, but I don't, because eighteen years on this earth has taught me that no matter what goes wrong, it's always my fault.   
  
If Mom runs in here, Lazzaro will protest that he made an honest mistake.   
  
Mom will tell me I'm attention-seeking, and I'll end up being forced to apologize for causing drama in the middle of the night. I'd rather gargle hot sauce and toilet cleaner than say sorry to this man.  
  
""What are you doing in my room?"" I hiss, holding tight to the blankets.  
  
""Your mom's pissing me off.""  
  
When are they not pissing each other off? Every time they fight, I'm the one who pays for it. Mom walks around slamming doors and shouting. Lazzaro finds me and destroys whatever peace I've found watching TV, swimming in the pool, or reading in the garden.  
  
""Then go and sleep on the sofa.""  
  
""But I like your bed.""  
  
""Then I'll go sleep on the sofa.""  
  
But Lazzaro grabs the back of my pajama top as I try to get out of bed. ""Running off? So rude when I'm being nice to you.""  
  
""How is this nice?"" I exclaim in an outraged whisper.  
  
""Did anyone else talk to you today?""  
  
Tonight, Uncle Tomaso and Aunt Sofia came to dinner with their children, two cousins who are older than me and another who is younger. At one point, I asked one of my cousins how school was going. Aunt Sofia immediately talked over me and changed the subject.  
  
""Screw you,"" I whisper, shuddering with anger and humiliation.  
  
Lazzaro slides an arm beneath me and drags me back against his arms. ""Cold? I'll warm you up.""  
  
His searing hot flesh presses against my back, scorching me from the nape of my neck to my heels. I struggle to get out of his grip, but both of his arms come around me. One of his hands is on my waist and the other is on my bare inner thigh. He's wearing sweats, but as his hips press into me, I feel the telltale ridge of something hard and thick against my butt.  
  
Panicked words fall from my lips. ""What the... is that your... Oh, my God.""  
  
""What's what?"" Lazzaro speaks directly into my ear, his deep voice rumbly and tinged with lust and amusement. I dig my nails into his muscular forearms and grit my teeth against the restless, fluttering feeling low in my belly. He gets off on tormenting me, and he's made that clear from day one. The moment he crossed the threshold into this house after their honeymoon, his expression dark with anger and every muscle bunched beneath his black T-shirt, he zeroed in on me. Someone was going to suffer for what he'd been forced to do, and I'm his perfect victim.  
  
No, it started before that day. Our eyes met at the church altar and his gaze fell to my nip//ples, which were pebbled into points and painfully obvious through my pink satin bridesmaid gown. It was so cold in the church, they were practically visible from space.  
  
The priest prompted him to say his vows, and he lifted his eyes to mine as he spoke the words, I do.  
  
Like a curse.  
  
Like a threat.  
  
""Why are you torturing me like this? What did I ever do to you?""  
  
In our reflections, Lazzaro's eyes narrow with spite. ""It's nothing personal, Mia. I just hate your family.""  
  
He didn't want to marry Mom, and Mom didn't want to marry him, but it was arranged by our families like something out of the Middle Ages. The Rosetti family wants to force Lazzaro to settle down, and Mom wants some of the power and money that the Rosetti men wield like weapons in this city. Absolutely nothing about their marriage has to do with love. It's pure business.  
  
I lie still for a moment, letting Lazzaro think he's won whatever sick game he's playing. He reaches up and palms one of my bre//asts like he owns it. And pleasure courses through me.  
  
I ram my elbow into Lazzaro's stomach and fling myself off the bed.   
  
""Ah-ah, Mia,"" he taunts. ""Can't have you roaming the house in the middle of the night. Good girls stay in bed.""  
  
I growl with frustration as loud as I dare. ""I hate you,"" I seethe, wrenching myself back and forth in his iron-like grip.  
  
""I hate you more.""  
  
I buck in his arms until his hand lands on my intimacy and his fingers curl to cup my se//x over my pajama shorts. I inhale sharply. ""What are you doing?""  
  
""Ride my fingers.""  
  
""Go to HELL,"" I say through gritted teeth. My whole body is rigid as I wait for him to continue my humiliation. To grow bolder. To become an even worse man by invading my clothing. But Lazzaro doesn't move. Instead, he laughs softly, and I see in our reflection that he closes his eyes and relaxes.  
  
""Whatever. They're there if you need them.""  
  
And Lazzaro goes to sleep, leaving his fingers right where they are, tucked against my se//x. My heart pounds, and my heart feels like it's about to explode. I take as deep a breath as I can, locked in the cage of Lazzaro's arms. I'll wait until he's asleep and then get the hell out of here.  
  
My eyes focus on our reflection. I'm flat-che//sted and straight-waisted, and I have never felt sexy. But I look different in Lazzaro's big arms with his muscular forearm draped around my middle, and I feel a little bit precious with his sleep-softened face pressed into the side of my neck. He looks as rough and scary as always, but the way he's curled around me seems... protective. Possessive.  
  
Like I'm wanted for a change.  
  
My gaze sweeps down his body, from the hard planes of his face and jaw to his shoulder looming over mine.   
  
The bumps of his ribs beneath his T-shirt and the inch of warm, tanned skin where his top has ridden up his belly.   
  
Lazzaro always looks too big to be allowed, but right now his bigness seems just right. My heart pounds and my stomach is alive with fluttering. I shift slightly in his arms and feel the unmistakable sensation of wetness between my legs and against his fingers through my thin cotton shorts.  
  
And because I'm wet and slippery, the pressure of his fingers against my cl//it feels amazing. Lazzaro is the biggest asshole I've ever met, but he's also stupidly hot, and I hate him even more because of it. Every time he smirks at me, I can tell he's thinking how great he is.  
  
Barely realizing I'm doing it, I rotate my hips in slow circles. My eyes drift closed as the tiny movements cause a tidal wave of sensation to crash through me. I've masturbated plenty of times before, and the results have been swift but unsatisfying. Mechanically, everything works as it's supposed to, but something was always missing.  
  
Someone to fantasize about.  
  
My eyes snap open and fasten on Lazzaro's sleeping face. Mom's husband is not the object of my desires. That's just sick. But he is aggressively masculine and smells like sin, two things I crave, apparently, because my hips are still moving on their own. Back and forth on Lazzaro's fingers. I let out a soft pant as the sensations kick up a notch.  
  
I'll stop.  
  
I will.  
  
This is so screwed up and wrong.  
  
But so is he for coming in here.  
  
Lazzaro's arms are painfully tight around me, and his hard-on is wedged tight in my butt. The room is dark, and my core is so molten hot that reality starts to slide out of my grasp. There's just pleasure and a man's strong fingers against my intimacy, and the memory of his sultry voice breathing in my ear, Ride my fingers.  
  
I let out the tiniest of whimpers, but Lazzaro's breathing stays deep and even. He has no idea what's happening, and I'm close—so close—and I can't make myself stop. It's never felt this good before, and I have to discover what's waiting for me on the other side of this delicious feeling.  
  
Just a little more... just a little more... I want... I need...  
  
Heat and pleasure rise up and crash over me. My body flexes in Lazzaro's strong arms as I hurtle beyond all conscious thought and straight into pure pleasure.  
  
That was better than anything I've felt in my entire life.  
  
I drew in a deep breath and open my eyes.  
  
Lazzaro is awake and staring at me, his expression absolutely feral.  
  
Fear lashes through me, and I yelp, grabbing hold of his taut forearms and clinging to him, even though he's the one I'm afraid of.  
  
""I wasn't..."" I start to say in a high-pitched, panicked voice.  
  
With a growl, Lazzaro rolls on top of me. His bulk pins me face first to the mattress and his hot breath seethes in my ear. ""Again.""  
  
My eyes open wide. With his feet, he forces my legs open and thrusts his hips down, pushing my intimacy against his fingers.  
  
""What? No—""  
  
My intimacy rolls against his hand, and I moan as pure pleasure builds inside me again. He keeps rhythmically thrusting himself against my butt while he moves his fingers in a come here motion.  
  
""Stop that,"" I buzz angrily into the mattress. I try to buck him off, but he's too heavy, and I only succeed in working myself harder against his fingers. I can't possibly come again. Not so soon. Surely bodies aren't built that way, but to my horror, heat and pleasure are mounting within me. I feel him through layers of fabric like we're completely bare. His c0ck against my butt. His fingers on my intimacy. He's breathing hard in my ear like we really are screwing.  
  
""Come on, Mia. Show me how bad girls get off in the middle of the night.""  
  
""I'm going to kill... ahh."" To my shame, everything down there suddenly tightens up and bursts gloriously apart.  
  
""Again,"" he orders, before I can even draw breath back into my searing lungs. A threat. A brutal demand.  
  
A third time? I couldn't. My se//x is oversensitized and his touch sends bolts of pleasure-pain coursing through me. I writhe against his hand, practically crying. Wishing it would stop but needing it to go on. I can't think, can't breathe. There's only me and him and I've never felt so gloriously out of control.  
  
""Do as you're told, Mia. I'm not letting you up until you come again.""  
  
Lazzaro thrusts hard against my butt through his sweats and his hot breath is on the back of my neck. The hottest man I've ever laid eyes on has me pinned in place, and my body craves to give him what he wants. His brutal assault on my senses forces a third orgasm from me.  
  
I press my face into the pillow and moan, wishing it didn't feel so good to be so thoroughly humiliated.

1p9dtbc,https://i.redd.it/ersaer0c244g1.png,"Take Me, My Stepfather","My eyes snap open, and a scream rises up my throat.





Every muscle in my body goes rigid, and terror claws at my heart. Please let this be a dream. A nightmare.





Directly in front of me is the floor-to-ceiling mirror on the front of my wardrobe, and I stare into my own wide-eyed, terror-stricken reflection. My cheek is pressed into the pillow, and the white ruffled strap of my pajama top has slipped down. A shaft of silver moonlight falls across my comforter, and the clock on my bedside table ticks out every agonizing second. It's nearly one in the morning. The witching hour?





More like the devil's hour.





And the devil's in my bed.





A large, muscular figure is cloaked in darkness. He shifts with a sleepy murmur, and the sheer size of him rocks my whole body. His head is behind mine on the pillow, and I can see little of him except for the dark, silky hair falling across his forehead and the sleeve of his black T-shirt stretched tight around his muscular bicep.





This man is huge. Tall and built like a linebacker. The first time I laid eyes on him, I thought he was uncomfortably, aggressively large, and I still think that every time he walks into a room. I feel like I'm sharing this usually generous bed with a nine-foot demon from hell. His body heat is scorching the backs of my bare legs, and my normally sweet-smelling bedroom is filled with an invasive masculine scent.





I hate this man in the daylight, and I fear him at night. I can't stand him looking at me or even breathing near me, and I absolutely loathe the sensation of his body brushing against mine. Every second of every day, I'm trying to avoid his massive body in the kitchen or ignore the way he glares at me across the dining table. The last place he should be is in my bed. We're not lovers.





We're not even friends.





Lazzaro Rosetti is Mom's twenty-nine-year-old husband, a grade-A asshole, and my new stepfather.





I angle my chin up and sniff the air, trying to catch the scent of alcohol, which might explain why the hell Lazzaro has mistaken my bedroom for the one he shares with Mom, but there's nothing but the aroma of his cologne. I say ""shares,"" but my new stepfather is unpredictable, coming in and out of the house at all hours of the day and night. He's more like a restless animal than a man. Sometimes I catch him sleeping on the sofa or on a deck chair out by the pool. One morning last week, he was sleeping on the living room floor, and I stepped over him on my way to the kitchen. Lazzaro came suddenly alive, grabbing my ankle and refusing to let go as I squealed and tried to shake him off. His grip was an iron manacle, and his green eyes flashed with malice. All the while, he was grinning like this was a game to him.





I managed to kick him in the ribs with my sneaker, and he grunted in pain. Still grinning, he yanked me closer so he could take his revenge by looking up my skirt.





Lazzaro gazed up at me from the floor. ""Mm, white lace. My favorite.""





Cheeks burning with humiliation, I shoved my skirt between my legs. ""You asshole.""





Mom's footsteps could be heard coming down the sweeping marble stairs, and Lazzaro let go of me so fast that I stumbled. By the time she came into the kitchen with a crimson-and-gold silk robe hanging from her elegant shoulders, he was leaning against the kitchen counter, waiting for the coffee machine to finish dispensing a double shot of Colombian roast.





I found my voice a few seconds later. ""Mom, Lazzaro just grabbed me, and he wouldn't let go.""





Lazzaro passed the coffee to Mom, no cream or sugar, just how she likes it. She stared in confusion at his out-of-character thoughtful gesture but then accepted the cup.





""Mia stumbled and I didn't want her to fall and hurt herself,"" he explained mildly.





""That's not what—""





Mom winced and pinched her brow. ""Mia, please keep your voice down. I just woke up. And next time, look where you're going.""





Lazzaro folded his arms across his enormous chest and smirked at me behind his wife's back.





Mom pushed out through the double doors to drink her coffee in the garden. She didn't look at me once. Mom almost never looks at me.





After all these years, you'd think I'd be used to it, but it still hurts being the Bianchi family's shame. Mom's face falls or her eyes skim over me whenever I walk into a room. Grandmother flinches whenever I speak at the dinner table. My three uncles give me stony glares before kissing my older sisters hello warmly.





A vicious whisper sounded in my ear. ""So, it's true. No one believes a single word out of your mouth.""





Lazzaro was standing right behind me. He was so close that I could see every detail of the scar that cuts vertically through his lips on the left-hand side. It gives him a dangerous, roguish appearance, especially when he smiles and bares his strong white teeth.





His vindictive mouth whispered, ""Or maybe it's just that they don't give a fuck what you have to say, and never have.""





Now he's in my bed, and I don't know if it's a mistake or on purpose. But I'm not sticking around to find out. I grasp the edge of the mattress and wriggle my way toward it, staring at our reflections in the mirror and hoping I don't wake him.





Lazzaro's eyes pop open. I catch the feral gleam of his green gaze in the darkness, and my stomach swoops. A slow, nasty smile spreads over his face.





He's not confused.





He knows exactly whose bed he's in.





Chapter 2





MIA





I want to scream, but I don't, because eighteen years on this earth has taught me that no matter what goes wrong, it's always my fault.





If Mom runs in here, Lazzaro will protest that he made an honest mistake.





Mom will tell me I'm attention-seeking, and I'll end up being forced to apologize for causing drama in the middle of the night. I'd rather gargle hot sauce and toilet cleaner than say sorry to this man.





""What are you doing in my room?"" I hiss, holding tight to the blankets.





""Your mom's pissing me off.""





When are they not pissing each other off? Every time they fight, I'm the one who pays for it. Mom walks around slamming doors and shouting. Lazzaro finds me and destroys whatever peace I've found watching TV, swimming in the pool, or reading in the garden.





""Then go and sleep on the sofa.""





""But I like your bed.""





""Then I'll go sleep on the sofa.""





But Lazzaro grabs the back of my pajama top as I try to get out of bed. ""Running off? So fucking rude when I'm being nice to you.""





""How is this nice?"" I exclaim in an outraged whisper.





""Did anyone else talk to you today?""





Tonight, Uncle Tomaso and Aunt Sofia came to dinner with their children, two cousins who are older than me and another who is younger. At one point, I asked one of my cousins how school was going. Aunt Sofia immediately talked over me and changed the subject.





""Screw you,"" I whisper, shuddering with anger and humiliation.





Lazzaro slides an arm beneath me and drags me back against his chest. ""Cold? I'll warm you up.""





His burning hot flesh presses against my back, scorching me from the nape of my neck to my heels. I struggle to get out of his grip, but both of his arms come around me. One of his hands is on my waist and the other is on my bare inner thigh. He's wearing sweats, but as his hips press into me, I feel the telltale ridge of something hard and thick against my ass.





Panicked words fall from my lips. ""What the... is that your... Oh, my God.""





""What's what?"" Lazzaro speaks directly into my ear, his deep voice rumbly and tinged with lust and amusement. I dig my nails into his muscular forearms and grit my teeth against the restless, fluttering feeling low in my belly. He gets off on tormenting me, and he's made that clear from day one. The moment he crossed the threshold into this house after their honeymoon, his expression dark with anger and every muscle bunched beneath his black T-shirt, he zeroed in on me. Someone was going to suffer for what he'd been forced to do, and I'm his perfect victim.





No, it started before that day. Our eyes met at the church altar and his gaze fell to my nipples, which were pebbled into points and painfully obvious through my pink satin bridesmaid gown. It was so cold in the church, they were practically visible from space.





The priest prompted him to say his vows, and he lifted his eyes to mine as he spoke the words, I do.





Like a curse.





Like a threat.





""Why are you torturing me like this? What did I ever do to you?""





In our reflections, Lazzaro's eyes narrow with spite. ""It's nothing personal, Mia. I just hate your fucking family.""





He didn't want to marry Mom, and Mom didn't want to marry him, but it was arranged by our families like something out of the Middle Ages. The Rosetti family wants to force Lazzaro to settle down, and Mom wants some of the power and money that the Rosetti men wield like weapons in this city. Absolutely nothing about their marriage has to do with love. It's pure business.





I lie still for a moment, letting Lazzaro think he's won whatever sick game he's playing. He reaches up and palms one of my breasts like he owns it. My nipple hardens against the friction of his hand, and pleasure courses through me.





I ram my elbow into Lazzaro's stomach and fling myself off the bed. I manage to get to the edge of the mattress before he snatches me back against his hard chest.





""Ah-ah, Mia,"" he taunts. ""Can't have you roaming the house in the middle of the night. Good girls stay in bed.""





I growl with frustration as loud as I dare. ""I hate you,"" I seethe, wrenching myself back and forth in his iron-like grip.





""I hate you more.""





I buck in his arms until his hand lands on my pussy and his fingers curl to cup my sex over my pajama shorts. I inhale sharply. ""What are you doing?""





""Ride my fingers.""





Chapter 3





MIA





""Go to hell,"" I say through gritted teeth. My whole body is rigid as I wait for him to continue my humiliation. To grow bolder. To become an even worse man by invading my clothing. But Lazzaro doesn't move. Instead, he laughs softly, and I see in our reflection that he closes his eyes and relaxes.





""Whatever. They're there if you need them.""





And Lazzaro goes to sleep, leaving his fingers right where they are, tucked against my sex. My heart pounds, and my chest feels like it's about to explode. I take as deep a breath as I can, locked in the cage of Lazzaro's arms. I'll wait until he's asleep and then get the hell out of here.





My eyes focus on our reflection. I'm flat-chested and straight-waisted, and I have never felt sexy. But I look different in Lazzaro's big arms with his muscular forearm draped around my middle, and I feel a little bit precious with his sleep-softened face pressed into the side of my neck. He looks as rough and scary as always, but the way he's curled around me seems... protective. Possessive.





Like I'm wanted for a change.





My gaze sweeps down his body, from the hard planes of his face and jaw to his shoulder looming over mine.





The bumps of his ribs beneath his T-shirt and the inch of warm, tanned skin where his top has ridden up his belly.





Lazzaro always looks too big to be allowed, but right now his bigness seems just right. My heart pounds and my stomach is alive with fluttering. I shift slightly in his arms and feel the unmistakable sensation of wetness between my legs and against his fingers through my thin cotton shorts.





And because I'm wet and slippery, the pressure of his fingers against my clit feels amazing. Lazzaro is the biggest asshole I've ever met, but he's also stupidly hot, and I hate him even more because of it. Every time he smirks at me, I can tell he's thinking how great he is.





Barely realizing I'm doing it, I rotate my hips in slow circles. My eyes drift closed as the tiny movements cause a tidal wave of sensation to crash through me. I've masturbated plenty of times before, and the results have been swift but unsatisfying. Mechanically, everything works as it's supposed to, but something was always missing.





Someone to fantasize about.





My eyes snap open and fasten on Lazzaro's sleeping face. Mom's husband is not the object of my desires. That's just sick. But he is aggressively masculine and smells like sin, two things I crave, apparently, because my hips are still moving on their own. Back and forth on Lazzaro's fingers. I let out a soft pant as the sensations kick up a notch.





I'll stop.





I will.





This is so fucked up and wrong.





But so is he for coming in here.





Lazzaro's arms are painfully tight around me, and his hard-on is wedged tight in my ass. The room is dark, and my core is so molten hot that reality starts to slide out of my grasp. There's just pleasure and a man's strong fingers against my pussy, and the memory of his sultry voice breathing in my ear, Ride my fingers.





I let out the tiniest of whimpers, but Lazzaro's breathing stays deep and even. He has no idea what's happening, and I'm close—so close—and I can't make myself stop. It's never felt this good before, and I have to discover what's waiting for me on the other side of this delicious feeling.





Just a little more... just a little more... I want... I need...





Heat and pleasure rise up and crash over me. My body flexes in Lazzaro's strong arms as I hurtle beyond all conscious thought and straight into pure pleasure.





That was better than anything I've felt in my entire life.





I suck in a deep breath and open my eyes.





Lazzaro is awake and staring at me, his expression absolutely feral.





Fear lashes through me, and I yelp, grabbing hold of his taut forearms and clinging to him, even though he's the one I'm afraid of.





""I wasn't..."" I start to say in a high-pitched, panicked voice.





With a growl, Lazzaro rolls on top of me. His bulk pins me face first to the mattress and his hot breath seethes in my ear. ""Again.""





My eyes open wide. Lazzaro's fingers are still tight against my clit. With his feet, he forces my legs open and thrusts his hips down, pushing my pussy against his fingers.





""What? No—""





My clit rolls against his hand, and I moan as pure pleasure builds inside me again. He keeps rhythmically thrusting himself against my ass while he moves his fingers in a come here motion.





""Stop that,"" I buzz angrily into the mattress. I try to buck him off, but he's too heavy, and I only succeed in working myself harder against his fingers. I can't possibly come again. Not so soon. Surely bodies aren't built that way, but to my horror, heat and pleasure are mounting within me. I feel him through layers of fabric like we're completely naked. His cock against my ass. His fingers on my clit. He's breathing hard in my ear like we really are screwing.





""Come on, Mia. Show me how bad girls get off in the middle of the night.""





""I'm going to kill... ahh."" To my shame, everything down there suddenly tightens up and bursts gloriously apart.





""Again,"" he orders, before I can even draw breath back into my burning lungs. A threat. A brutal demand.





A third time? I couldn't. My sex is oversensitized and his touch sends bolts of pleasure-pain coursing through me. I writhe against his hand, practically crying. Wishing it would stop but needing it to go on. I can't think, can't breathe. There's only me and him and I've never felt so gloriously out of control.





""Do as you're told, Mia. I'm not letting you up until you come again.""





Lazzaro thrusts hard against my ass through his sweats and his hot breath is on the back of my neck. The hottest man I've ever laid eyes on has me pinned in place, and my body craves to give him what he wants. His brutal assault on my senses forces a third orgasm from me.





I press my face into the pillow and moan, wishing it didn't feel so good to be so thoroughly humiliated.





My stepfather raggedly breathes into my ear, ""Good fucking girl.""

The absolute shit storm we went through today after yesterday’s shit storm trying to find a way to eat. Today I had a shift from 6am to 5pm. I wanted to make sure I got off earlier so I can pick up the babies & head to the food pantry. Welp to my surprise , we get there & they are closed until Monday & the only one open tomorrow is the next town over. On top of that, the babies behavior this evening after picking them up has been terrible, especially the tantrums that they have decided to throw! My head is going to EXPLODE. 

I feel like I am doomed & it’s humiliating. I am so freaking exhausted working so hard that some days I can’t afford basic necessities. We moved a few years ago due to my job position. I make over the threshold for government assistance & have applied for child-support but doesn’t make a dent in anything. I literally PRAY that my babies see how freaking hard I am trying for them. Mama is tired, exhausted & overwhelmed doing this by myself. My family is non-existent after I cut them off financially from moving. When will this get easier ?

I am disappointed in myself. My elderly neighbor brought us two frozen Hot Pockets & a bag of oranges until I can find a solution. I’m tired of crying. I need sleep. I need coffee. I need friends.

— Myung-gi always DENIES that they're friends, and it genuinely hurts Nam-gyu (he never admits it).

— Namgyu likes creating dating rumors of them together, so he tends to post things deliberately hinting to it. Just to stir the pot.

— Myung-gi's in a constant state of frustration around Nam-gyu, yet he never truly leaves him.

— When Myung-gi does those ""HITTING X MILLION SUBSCRIBERS IN REAL TIME"" stream, Nam-gyu often unsubscribes and subscribes at the 999,999 to piss him off. 

— They go on cafes often, Nam-gyu gets plain black coffee everyday, while Myung-gi gets those loooooong trendy coffee orders.

— Myung-gi avoids having Nam-gyu appear in his channel because he makes everything chaotic, but Nam-gyu always finds a way to just... show up out of nowhere. His subscribers enjoy Nam-gyu's appearances though.

— Nam-gyu has those rare moments of clarity and genuine thoughtfulness time to time in a conversation that Myung-gi secretly enjoys. Normally when it's late at night and they're just talking about themselves. 

— Myung-gi cannot sleep without white noise, while Nam-gyu finds it too distracting to sleep with.

— Remember Nam-gyu singing Love Scenario? He's was a huge K-pop fan during his teenage years, but he'd never admit it now since he looks down on those who enjoy that 'overrated' genre (hypocrite).

— Myung-gi worries when Nam-gyu DOESN'T bother him for too long. At least once, he had to come running to Club Pentagon late at night to make sure Nam-gyu didn't overdose or something.

1p9dnkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1p9dnkm/nobody_believes_that_i_was_kidnapped_by_fairies/,Nobody believes that I was kidnapped by fairies on Christmas Eve.,"Dr. Casey was my latest in the long line of psychologists assigned to me since my so-called mental breakdown. 

Sitting in front of me, her smile was patient and her eyes were trying to be sincere. I liked her office. 

It was a lot cosier than the others. 

The one in Boston had walls that made me feel like I was in a psych ward. 

Sickly green, resembling barf, with too-bright lights and a TV in the waiting room that only played ancient game shows with zero volume. 

Dr. Casey’s office was minimalist with a desk and a bookshelf. 

The decor was warm, purplish blue, an outdated laptop sitting in front of her. 

Unlike my other therapists, she seemed… human. 

While the others had clinical white offices and scary looking posters on the wall bearing mental health disorders and human trafficking warnings, Dr Casey had stained coffee mugs and ancient comic books piled on top of each other.

She chewed on her pen between writing, tapping her feet to a beat only she could hear. 

Which was familiar and relatable. 

My therapist was a beautiful woman, kind, brown flecked eyes and velvet coloured hair tied into an untidy ponytail. 

When she leaned forward and met my gaze, I found myself taken aback by her natural beauty.

She smelled of fresh pine and lemon, and had a smile that wanted to help. 

Dr. Casey made me feel comfortable. 

I thought I could tell her everything. 

So, I started talking. 

Hesitantly at first, but the more I was speaking and actually letting everything out, all of this fear and frustration and anger I had been bottling up for a whole year.

Initially, she seemed interested when I told her the basics, nodding and making comments to assure me she was listening. 

I started telling my story as normally as possible. 

My flight was cancelled on Christmas Eve, and because of my age I had no choice but to join my fellow young travellers inside the unaccompanied minors lounge. 

Dr. Casey kept smiling and scribbling in her notebook until I got into the meat of my trauma. Why I couldn't fully look her in the eye, and even a year later, I still struggled to sit still.

My hands were always wandering, either delving into my lap or playing with stray thread on my jeans, my fingers steepling together, constantly  clammy. 

I could never fully suck air into my lungs during a therapy session. 

I had an odd posture, leaned over myself, my lungs crushed. 

There was never enough air for me to breathe, and my body was constantly too light, like at any moment I would lose contact with the ground all together.

This kind of thing was better to explain by saying, “I had a psychotic break” but I thought I could talk to someone who would listen. Who wouldn't call me crazy. 

I always felt small and childish, hating the words coming from my mouth. 

Eighteen years old, and I still felt so much younger. “I was kidnapped,” I told her, a lump growing in my throat. 

Dr. Casey’s smile faded, eyes darkening. 

I noticed her fingers tighten around the pen. She began to write before pausing, her gaze snapping to me. “Kidnapped?”

I could already see the cogs in her head turning, ready to make phone calls and offer support– maybe even call the police. 

It's not like I didn't look like a kidnapping victim. 

I was sickly pale from malnourishment, my hair hung in tangled streaks in front of my face, and I hadn't bathed in days. 

But my failure to meet basic hygiene was for a completely different reason. 

I didn't know how to tell her I couldn't wash or brush my hair, and I couldn't force food down my throat. They wouldn't let me. 

When I spoke of them, she leaned forward with wide, sympathetic eyes that were going to listen, urging me to take my time. 

She thought they were human, an abusive family member or significant other. 

That was until I dropped my gaze, shuffling uncomfortably on my chair. 

It had been the same leather chair for three weeks, and I still couldn't get comfortable. 

The upholstery felt wrong grazing the backs of my jeans. I had been nervously picking on it since starting my session. 

I had been skating around the subject of my depressive episodes. 

Because when I eventually let loose and went into detail, I always lost them. 

I lost my therapists with one single word. 

“Kidnapped,” I said again, “By fairies.”

Dr. Casey stopped writing, her lip twitching slightly. She lifted her head. 

“You were kidnapped by fairies,” her brow shot into her hairline. 

Dr. Casey’s expression crumpled into what might have been sympathy before confusion and amusement took over. 

Before I could respond, she cleared her throat a little too harshly, and spoke the words my last five therapists had said with the exact tone. “Miss Jaimison, aren't you a little old to still believe in fairies?” 

Yes, I was. 

I didn't even believe in them when I was a little kid, and now I was being hunted by them. In the space of a year, fairies, and to an extent, Santa Clause were real. 

Dr. Casey sighed when I didn't reply.  

“Okay then, Ruby,” she continued to scribble in her notebook. 

Her smile was still polite, though a little strained. Just like the others. 

“Why don't you talk me through what happened?” 

I started to, but she cut me off. 

“Miss Jaimison, there is nothing wrong with disguising your mental trauma with fantasy. It's common with young people.”

Fantasy? 

Was she fucking serious?

I knew the difference between reality and fantasy. 

For the last several months, both had blurred into each other, enveloping me completely. To other people, fantasy was what they saw on TV or read in books. 

The fae folk, beings of light and beauty hiding amongst the flowers. 

Which was the fantasy I grew up with. 

That fantasy, however, had been haunting me since I escaped my fate to become an heir of the kingdom. 

It existed in the tricks that woke me up at night, open windows when I was sure I'd shut them, and poison ivy between my sheets, my possessions being whisked away. That was a warning.

When I refused to submit, they bled inside my brain and made me question my own reality. I coughed up my own blood and teeth, lost clumps of my hair.

They wouldn't let me shower, or brush my hair, or eat. 

They were constantly there, whispering and giggling in my ear, murmuring nursery rhymes in their language, their songs all entangled with my lost friends' names. 

These little bastards tugged on my hair when nobody was watching, a symphony of childish giggles entwined in my skull. 

“It's not… fantasy,” I spoke coolly and calmly, but in the corner of my eye, I could see sharp flickers of movement. 

“It's real,” I whispered. “I was taken to a different world where fairies exist.” 

She nodded, continuing to write. “Okay, and would you say you were awake during this, uh… this venture? You said you were falling asleep in an airport terminal, correct?” 

Dr. Casey nodded at me with a smile. 

“Do you think maybe you experienced a vivid fever dream?” 

“No.” I swatted at my own face again. I could hear giggles. They were laughing at me. “No, I was definitely awake,” I spoke through gritted teeth. “I wasn't alone either. There was a group of kids with me, and there were these screens that…” 

I caught hold of myself. “I know it sounds crazy, but,” I struggled with my hands, stuffing them into my lap. 

“These screens… the ones in the room they took us to. They hypnotised kids into thinking they didn't have parents.” 

“Mmm hmm.” Dr. Casey lifted her gaze. “So, are we talking, like, mind control?”

I nodded. “Yes. There was this Christmas themed animation playing, and it put my friend into a weird trance.” 

I felt my own secondhand embarrassment, resisting the urge to rake my nails down my face. 

“It made him think he was an orphan. Just like everyone else. I saw it too, and I can't explain it.” my hands were wandering again, this time streaking through filthy strands of my hair. 

I could feel them tugging my scalp. It was an endless tug of war with them. 

Still though, thinking back to their influence on me, that for a single moment with my eyes captured by their magic, my mind drowned by their light and lullabies, I thought I was an orphan myself. 

It was so vivid. I had been suffocated with false memories of an orphanage I never attended; wooden bunk beds and children that were not real. 

These things had planted fake thoughts, fake feelings and memories inside my brain, enchanting me and luring me in, before I had snapped out of it with the help of Levi and Thalia. 

I didn't realise I was choking all of that out, words tangling from my lips, my voice splintering, until I was handed a tissue, and I swiped at my eyes. 

I didn't mean to say any of that out loud, but saying their names, or at least revisiting the memories I had tried to suppress, was a surprising weight off my chest. 

Dr. Casey continued writing. She was scribbling way too much to just be making notes. “Okay, and who was this friend?” she looked up at me, lips quirked into a smile. She wasn't laughing at me. 

This was a sympathy smile. She thought I was fucking crazy. 

I tried to lean across the desk to see what she was writing, but she easily hid her notebook from my prying eyes. 

“Was he an, um, a ‘fairy person’ too?”

“Jude Whitlock,” I whispered. 

His name didn't feel real or right on my tongue, almost like he didn't exist anymore. 

“No. He was a human, and they took him along with the others.” 

I played with the thread on my jeans. 

“He was the worst affected. I think because he, uh, he already felt detached from his parents. So, it wasn't hard for them to wipe them from his memory.” 

I straightened up in my seat. “Jude didn't have a good relationship with his Mom.”

Dr. Casey cocked a brow. “Oh?” 

“Yeah.  He said he only got to spend time with her two days a year.”

She paused writing, tapping her pen. “And you haven't seen him since?”

I shook my head. “No. The last time I saw him, he was completely under their control.”

“Their… fairy mind control?” Dr. Casey cleared her throat. Something flickered in her expression. I saw her write *separation* followed by a question mark. 

“And did you say the other kids…” she flicked back through the pages of her notebook. 

“Levi and Thalia. Were they taken too?”

Nodding, I squeezed my eyes shut. 

“Yes. But they were replaced by fake versions. I think they're called changelings.”

“Uh-huh.” she chewed on her pen. “So, to go over, your human friends were kidnapped by fairies and replaced with…” 

She nodded at her notebook, “replicas of them, that are called Strays.”

I shook my head. “No, the Strays are different. They're not wanted, and given back to the human world. They're previously kidnapped kids no longer wanted.”

She met my gaze. “And have you met a Stray?”

I did. 

When I was saved by the kind fae who brought me back, there were two Strays in the car.

I still remembered their battered and bruised faces, skeletal figures and haunted eyes. 

I remembered the markings on the boy's head from his crown, his flesh shredded and burned, sliced and ripped apart. 

The slits in the girl's back, where a semblance of wings may have been before being cruelly sliced away. 

I never saw them again. 

There were hunters on earth who specifically went for Stray kids. I was told they were  worth millions to humans.

“I did,” I admitted. “But they ran away before I could talk to them.”

“Ahh, of course. They ran away.” 

I stuffed my fists in my lap, trying to breathe. “You think I'm crazy.” 

Dr. Casey dropped her pen with a sigh, her gaze flicking to me. “Well, at least you're self aware. Honestly, this all sounds a little far fetched. I am not supposed to be harsh with my patients, but you are an exceptional case.” she inclined her head. 

“Ruby, how exactly did you get it into your head that you're being hunted by fairies? This world,” she glanced at her notebook. 

“All of these  things. Your friends being kidnapped and uh… half fairy kids spirited away, child eating plants, magical doorways and stray kids being hunted down. It’s not really real, is it?” 

Here we go.

“Ruby, the world is boring. And I don't blame you for creating this world inside your head.""

Dr. Casey offered me another sympathetic smile. 

“You are an intelligent young woman and you don't seem to be suffering from either neurological trauma or PTSD.” she tapped her manicure on the edge of her desk, rechecking over her notes. 

“Do you think you may have an overactive imagination? These friends you talk about.” I watched her fingers drum a single beat. 

“Levi, Jude, and Thalia. Are they perhaps people you strayed away from?""

Dr. Casey talked with her hands a lot. “It's possible that you have created a fantasy  to cope with losing their company.” she leaned back, her smile a lot more patient and understanding than all of the others. 

But she still didn't believe me. 

I think those words were what broke me. Not telling me I was too old to believe in fairies, or implying I had psychosis. She was telling me friends I lost were not real.

Just delusions of my mind. And if they were real, they were past friendships I was dwelling on and clinging onto.

Something splintered inside me. “I can't breathe,” I managed to grit out. “I feel like I've lost half of my breath since coming back, and sometimes I can't suck in air,” my voice broke. “It feels like I'm suffocating.” 

My therapist cocked her head. “That sounds a lot like asthma, Ruby.” she leaned forward. “Do you think maybe you're suffering from panic attacks?”

“They're not panic attacks!” I surprised myself with a yell. “They stole my breath!”

“Who stole your breath?” 

“The fairies!” I swallowed my words, clawing out my hair, pulling it from a particularly violent tugging match between two sets of tiny hands. “I mean fae... I think they're…referred to as fae?”

“Yes, I believe that is what they are called.” 

Her deadpan tone was starting to get under my skin. 

“Can't you see them?” I hissed out, holding out a strand of my hair. “They're right here!”

Dr. Casey’s mouth hung open, like she was struggling to coerce words. Before she could speak though, her gaze snapped to behind me, her expression twisting. “Liam, this is a private session!” 

I twisted around in my chair, meeting eyes with a boy who was my age. 

Hiding behind a bed of dark blonde curls, his eyes were wide with terror, parted lips moving like he was trying to speak, but failing. 

His gaze was frenzied, almost feral. 

It only took a single glance where intricate lines of ink danced across his forehead, like a child had been using his face as a canvas, for me to know what he was. 

Dr.  Casey was blind to the state of him, and he knew I'd noticed it, quickly yanking the hood of his sweater over his head. 

“Shut the door! I'm with a patient. I'll be with you in a moment.” 

The boy shot me a look, like he was trying to speak, before nodding and stumbling back into the waiting room, quietly shutting the door behind him. 

“Please excuse Liam, he's one of my patients. He doesn't know the meaning of privacy.” 

My therapist turned back to me, her expression relaxing. “Have you spoken to your parents about any of this? Do they offer their support?”

“No.”

I didn't mean to raise my voice, but I felt like I was being ripped apart inside. 

Parents were a sore subject. 

Just because I escaped the kingdom didn't mean I wasn't replaced too. 

There was a girl with my face living with my Mom and Dad. A girl with too-pale skin, a playfulness in eyes full of mischief.

I watched her meet my father at the airport. Ever since then, my life had been on a downward spiral. 

I choked up bloodstained flowers daily. I lost my teeth. There were vines growing at the back of my throat, markings I couldn't explain on my legs and arms. Like I had already been branded as theirs. 

Marked for the hunt. 

“I’m not crazy,” I whispered, trying to ignore my hair being yanked and pulled from side to side by tiny fingers. 

“I’ve lost my parents to a thing that looks exactly like me,” I hissed out. “I've lost half of my breath. There is a constant chokehold around my neck squeezing breath from my lungs. They're slowly killing me.” 

When I jumped up, Dr. Casey flinched slightly, like I was going to attack her.

“I'm constantly light on my feet,” I continued. “I feel like I'm floating. Like I'm never really touching the floor.”

Sinking back into my chair, I couldn't resist a sob. “They send me… warnings.” 

Dr. Casey hummed. “Warnings? Okay, and do you have them here with you?”

I thought back to the confused look on my Boston therapist’s face when I tried to hand her an old piece of parchment I'd found glued to my window with the remnants of my roommate's cat. 

The parchment was an invite into the kingdom and to accept my crown as an adopted heir to the court. 

The calligraphy was always graceful, beautiful, scrawled in human blood. 

I dropped my gaze, losing all my bravado. 

“It's…it's invisible to adults.”

Risking a glance, I could see the muscles in my therapist’s face twitching. 

Casey’s lip curled. I was losing her. “These warnings that are haunting you are… invisible to adults?” 

She cleared her throat. “Okay, so your kidnapped friends have been replaced by fairy replicas, and you are being haunted by a fairy kingdom, but their warnings are completely invisible to adults.”

I thought back to Liam. “And what they do to you,” I added. The markings and brandings. It's all invisible to adults.”

I could tell Dr. Casey was losing her patience. Still though, I was surprised she held out this long. 

The Boston therapist gave up at the start. 

“Miss Jaimison, you are eighteen years old which is classified as an adult.” 

I jumped when she dropped her pen on her desk. “Go home, Ruby.”

The woman nodded at me to stand up, and I did, grabbing my bag. “I don't think we need to continue this conversation.” 

Before I could protest, her phone rang, and she picked it up. 

“Yes,” My therapist lowered her voice, gesturing for me to shoo like I was a rabid raccoon. “Uh huh. Yes. Perfect condition. Yeah, I'm in the possession of…” she trailed off, meeting my gaze. 

“It.”

Dr Casey cleared her throat, irritation pricking in her eyes. 

“Ruby, I believe we are finished talking. Have a nice evening.” she went back to her phone. “Yes, I've got it with me. Mmm. Yeah, like I'd said, zero scratches or marks.”

When she collapsed into hissed whispers, I strode towards the door, only for something to catch my eye. On her bookshelf were tiny wooden fairies bearing wide smiles and intricate wings.

These things looked cute and playful. They looked nothing like the beings that kidnapped my friends. I couldn't resist turning around, my gut twisting. 

“Do you collect those things?”

Dr. Casey turned to me, her phone still glued to her ear. “Sorry, what was that?”

I pointed to the figures. “Those fairies. Do you collect them?”

Her gaze flitted to the figures, lips curving into a smile. “You could say that,” she pointed to her phone. “I'm actually in the middle of selling them right now, so if you wouldn't mind…” 

Before I could answer, I was already being escorted out of her office, the door slamming in my face. In the waiting room, the boy from earlier was sitting cross legged on a plastic chair. 

My heart leapt into my throat. 

I knew it wasn't him, but the way he was sitting, tense, dark eyes following me across the waiting room, like a caged animal, he reminded me of Jude.  

The last thing I said to him was reminding him he had a mother and a sister. 

But he had been far too gone to hear me, enveloped in their fairy dust. 

Unlike Jude, who previously had a destination, his parents house, this kid looked tragically lost. 

He purposely bowed his head to hide himself, but I already knew who and what he was. 

I could see exactly where his disgraced crown had sat on top of thick blonde curls. 

“You're a Stray.” I said, folding my arms. 

“Go away.” He shied away from me, shuffling back like a wild animal. The boy pressed his head into his lap. “They already know your name,” he sniffled.

His voice was rough. 

I could hear the turmoil and torture he had gone through. I wondered how long Liam had been inside the kingdom. From the way he was acting, he must have been young. “You can't run from them.”

A shiver skittered down my spine. “How did you escape?”

Liam looked up, his lips splitting into a grotesque smile of razor sharp teeth. 

“I was replaced.”

I nodded slowly, swatting at a tiny ball of golden light hovering in front of my eyes. 

Liam’s gaze followed its manic dance, his eyes narrowing. 

“My friends were taken,” I said, “Is there any chance they could be given back?”

Liam cocked his head. “Do they have your friends' names?”

I thought back to the list of naughty and nice. 

Yes. They had their full names. 

“Yes,” I said in a hiss of breath. “But–” 

“Liam?” Dr. Casey’s door flew open, her head poking out. 

I tried to ignore the boy flinching, the way his body seemed to lurch back. “Would you like to come in?” her gaze snapped to me. 

“Ruby. Go home please.”

I glanced at Liam, who looked panicked. 

“Do you… want to go in there?” I asked him. 

“Liam.” Dr. Casey’s tone hardened. 

He nodded with a quiet, “Yes” before ducking his head and following her into the office. When the door clicked shut behind them, I thought back to the miniature fairies sitting on her bookshelf. 

I hovered outside the door for a few more minutes, before swiftly leaving. 

I was on my way down the stairs to the reception area, when two men shoved past me on their way up. 

Dr. Casey told me to go home, so I did.

That night I woke up coughing up blood stained flowers, vines stuck between my teeth and blossoming at the back of my throat. They weren't just haunting me mentally, they were playing with my body. 

There was something there, twisted and sandwiched, stuffed down my throat. 

Standing in front of a mirror with tweezers, I forced the two blades into the back of my mouth, pinching a single vine. 

When I pulled it from my lips, my throat ruptured and I choked up blood tinged petals, and a growing tendril of earth entangled with a single strand of hair. 

Thalia. 

Her long red hair stuck in my memory, and now it was clogging my faucet and shower drain.

Thalia’s hair was the first real warning that they were coming. 

Quickly followed by a shred of Levi’s hoodie.

And then, Jude's private school sweater. 

It was always pieces of them, nothing was ever whole. All I got were torn remnants and fragments of what had been real. 

It felt like a tease, like they were dangling my friends in front of me. 

Cutting them apart, piece by piece. 

Until nothing remained. 

I grew sicker. Paler. Pulling scarlet streaked flowers from my lips and coughing up clumps of Thalia’s hair became a daily occurrence. 

I was barely conscious in class when the air around me suddenly stilled, a streak of shivers spiderwebbing down my bones. 

I could barely concentrate on the class itself, beforehand, white noise screaming in my ears. Now it was too silent. 

Like all the sound had been sucked into a vacuum. Even the sounds of light typing, brief conversations and pages flipping over. Everything had come to an eerie stop. Lifting my head, it wasn't just the sound. Movement had come to halt too. 

My professor stood at the front of the class. He was frozen, glued to the spot. 

But his eyes were still moving, frantically snapping left and right.

Around me, my classmates were paralysed to their seats. 

The ponytailed blonde next to me was mid-drinking her water. She was frozen, while water sloshed down her throat. 

I could sense that she was choking, her cheeks turning red and then purple. 

But she couldn't move. The sound of water filling her gut, her stomach expanding, sent my own catapulting into my throat. 

It took me a disorienting moment to realise the wave that had enveloped my class had taken me too. 

Glued to my chair, I caught a flash of movement in the corner of my eye. 

There was a shadow moving down the aisle, a figure drowned in light so bright I couldn't see a face. 

When a sharp breath sounded next to me, and the girl with the water dropped to the ground, I thought it was just her. 

But when it came again, another hiss of breath, and then another, students collapsing like dominoes, I knew exactly what was happening. 

It was pulling their breath from their lungs, teasing it, before tearing it from their lips. 

Bodies continued to drop around me. 

I could sense it, almost see it, wisps of dancing white being dragged from parted lips and disappearing into nothing. 

The lights flickered above me. 

I saw feet moving toward me, dancing down the steps. 

Closer. 

Under dull light, I glimpsed the torn remnants of a navy blue sweater clinging to a skeletal figure. The closer he came to me, I felt my own breath leave my lungs and squirm its up my throat, forced through my lips. But it didn't leave me.

Not yet.

When he stopped in front of me, the lingering students around me toppling off of their chairs, he teased my breath, once, and then twice, holding it between my frozen lips, letting me slowly suffocate. 

When my professor dropped, the lights brightened. The figure was no longer a shadow, a being that was once human. 

It still bared a human face, remnants of its old self. I wasn't sure what to call him. Beautiful, or maybe horrifying. 

I couldn't tear my gaze from his skin, flesh that had been battered and burned, branded and used as a canvas. 

There were intricate lines of black dancing his cheeks, just like Liam. But while Liam’s had been old, faded, his were wet and fresh. I could still see the gleam, imagine the dripping paintbrush. 

There was so much wrong with him. Malnourished cheeks and skin so pale and brittle, like the pages of a book. 

And yet I still found a sick sense of beauty, that grotesque and breathtaking beauty I remembered from their world. 

I had nightmares of him being twisted and contorted into one of them. But it was real. I had aged since our kidnapping. 

A whole year had gone by. Jude, however, was still frozen at sixteen years old. 

Dark brown curls adorned with flowers and thorns, a crown of bone sitting on top of his head. I could see sharp pieces of bone sliced into his flesh, old and new rivers or red streaking down his face. 

His lips carved into a feral smile that greeted me. 

No longer human and forever sixteen years old, I still recognised him. Jude suited his crown. 

He suited his smile, too-pointy teeth and eyes filled with mischief. 

Jude never had human parents, or at least ones that cared about him. Maybe that was why he had accepted his fate. 

Accepted his crown.

After all, what 16 year old human boy wouldn't want to be the heir to a fairy court? 

What he didn't suit, was the bruises and burns, his body twisted into a plaything for the Kingdom. Jude looked both human and fae, twin slits in his back, flaps of flesh resembling their sick idea of wings. 

I waited for him to take my breath. 

He did, tearing it to and from my lips like I was his own personal toy. 

When he was bored, Jude reached out his hand, finally, his eyes lighting up. 

I pretended not to see the scalding marks covering his arms. 

The rugged flesh on the backs of his hands. 

“Ruuuuuuuuby.”

From the look on his face, and the whispered giggles in my ear, him laughing with the fireflies buzzing around me tugging on my hair, I didn't have a choice. 

He made that clear when he violently ripped breaths from my lungs, one by one. 

I accepted his hand when I could move again, gulping in oxygen. 

Jude didn't speak to me. But he did speak to the things still clinging to my hair, giggling in their tongue twisting language. 

We left the room, his claw-like fingernails digging into my skin. 

He told me my classmates were not harmed.

However, they were missing a significant chunk of their breath. 

“Your sister,” I managed to get out, when he pulled me through the dark. I didn't even notice the passage of time. He could have had my breath for hours. 

Something rancid crept up my throat, and I spat out another explosion of red. 

More of Thalia’s hair stuck to my lips, glued to my chin. 

“Did you find her?”

He surprised me with an inhuman grin that was not his, a glitter in his eyes that was both insanity and glee. 

Jude had their exact mannerisms, their twitching smiles and gleeful eyes. 

He was a bigger version of the fireflies trying to rip my hair from my scalp, laughing along with them. “What sister?”

I was wrong.

I thought Jude still had lingering humanity. 

But he was completely gone. 

I knew where he was taking me. Jude took me back to the nightmare world that I had been told multiple times wasn't real. 

The world filled with child-eating plants, and the wooden cage filled with human children that I had escaped. 

I didn't feel as light back in their world. 

I felt like I could breathe again, my bare feet grazing the floor. 

I wasn't expecting the reception Jude got when he dragged me through streets threaded with plants and vines. 

Beings with painfully beautiful faces and horrifying twisted and contorted bodies dropped to their knees in front of him. 

The ground became harder to tread through, vines and flowers with minds of their own twisting around my ankles. Jude pulled me through them, laughing. 

Quickly, it turned to bones we were wading through. 

Humans. 

These things didn't just forcefully adopt  people. 

They murdered them, proudly brandishing their horrified looking faces. 

Stumbling after Jude, I scanned each kill. 

Levi and Thalia. They couldn't be here, right? 

Looking back, I think part of me wished they were. The palace was not what I was expecting; a building made purely of human bone and entangled vines, a towering structure standing over the court.

The guards standing in front of the doors bowed when Jude stepped through the door. While the exterior of the palace was exactly what I was expecting inside a fae court, the interior surprised me. 

I could tell the fae stole not just children, but human possessions. 

Glittering chandeliers hung from the ceiling, a staircase made purely of rose quartz.

The ground was made up of patchwork human flooring, carpet and marble with pieces of plastic, woven with thick greenery. 

In front of me loomed two thrones made up of entangled vine, the King and Queen, adorned in the remnants of children, blood and bone decorating them.

The Queen wore an adult human skull, velvet coloured hair framing a heart shaped face. Her clothes were patchwork, a dress made of white silk. 

She looked human at first glance, before her features were narrowing, like she was screwing with my perception. 

Jude lowered himself in front of them, yanking me with him.

Kneeling in front of the king, I could still see the skeletal smile of the victim sitting on top of his head. 

I could see exactly where their head had been savagely severed from their torso. 

His clothes were made up of flesh that had been dried and stitched together. I had to bow my head, swallowing a shriek. 

“He's wearing someone's skull,” I managed to breathe, my chest aching. 

Jude shot me a glare, and there was a splinter of his human self. “Be quiet.” 

Oh, so he could speak. 

The Queen stood, and spoke in a language I could not understand. 

Looking at Jude, at the knot between his brow, he could hear what she was saying in perfect clarity. To me, however, it was a colourful tongue twister language. 

“She’s asking all of her children to present themselves to her,” he murmured. 

“What does that mean?” 

“That something big is about to happen,” Jude  hummed. 

“Stand up. The Queen asks her children to present themselves to her only three times a day. Dawn, high eve, and late eve.” 

“What?”

He didn't reply, the sound of footsteps taking me off guard. They took their places next to the King and Queen.

I recognised Levi immediately, still dressed in the remnants of his Adventure Time sweater. 

His hair was overgrown, skin blistered and burned resembling a Stray. 

Unlike Jude's, his crown looked like it had been forced onto his head, splinters of bone glued to his skull, threaded vines and flowers adorning his hair. Levi’s eyes were empty of that glitter I remembered, when he called fake Santa a meth head. 

His smile was too wide. I could see blisters on his mouth where his lips had been sewn shut. I didn't want to see it, but I saw the exact transformation, slight points in ears hiding behind thick reddish curls, his face narrower, malnourished cheeks sticking out.

Following those same inky black lines marking his face, I wondered if male fae bore them. Just from looking at Levi Parish, the boy had fought a battle he had lost, ending in him bearing a crown forced on his head, and vacant eyes. 

Next to him…Thalia. 

She was perhaps the most transformed from the three. Her naked back had been twisted into something inhuman. 

I could see where her spine used to be, now something was growing from her flesh, something writhing up and down her skin, trying to burst out. Thalia’s hair was entangled in flowers and vines, a crown of thorn sitting on top of her head, instead of glued on like the boy's. 

Half of her pretty face had been scorched, and then clawed away, ugly flaps of flesh where her cheek was supposed to be. 

I could still see the claw marks on her neck, streaks of red. 

And yet, just like the boys, her grin was wide. 

The smile I knew was gone.

Looking at all three of them, it hit me that my friends weren't heirs to the throne. 

They were toys. 

Playthings.

Canvases for fae children. 

“Mother.” Jude lifted his head, smiling wide. “Father.” 

“Ruby.” The Queen’s voice was melodic. She rose gracefully. “I am so glad you finally came to your senses.”

I lifted my head.  “I had no choice.”

“Careful.” Jude breathed. “The last time I spoke back to them, I got the flesh melted off of my back.”

The Queen's lips curled. “Human child, do speak louder. You are mumbling.”

Instead of responding, I bowed my head. I was speaking before I could stop myself. “I’d like to… make a request.” 

“And what is that?” The Queen asked, tilting her head. “Speak clearly, Ruby.”

“An exchange.” I forced out. ""I would like to request that I exchange myself, Thalia Wednesday, Levi Parish and…” 

I struggled to speak, the words tangled on my tongue. My gaze flicked to Jude’s bruised knees, the thorns wrapped around this neck which were constantly squeezing breath from his lungs. “And Jude Whitlock.” I spat out. “For four human children of the same age.""

I stopped when Jude grabbed my arm, his eyes suddenly fearful. Terrified. His lips were twisted, failing to form words.

“What are you doing?!” His expression screamed.

“I accept.” 

I risked lifting my head, and she was smiling. 

“Ruby, you are yet to become my full blooded daughter, and you are already pledging yourself to rounding up human children!” She spoke with a manic giggle. 

“My, now how could I reject an offer like that? We are already in a deal for fifteen children this Christmas. Five more would be a luxury. Oh, the things we could do.""

Her words sent slithers down my spine. “No.” I said. “No, I didn’t mean—“

My feet left the ground, and I was choking, suddenly. The breath had been sucked from my lungs, and I felt them.. invisible fingers wrapped around my neck, squeezing. I was aware of my body hovering several feet off of the ground. 

The Queen sat back down. 

“You did not mean what?”

“I…”

“I don’t think you’ve been educated in our laws,” she said smoothly. “You do not speak my children's names. Do so again, and I will rip out your tongue.”

A fountain of red escaped my mouth, and I could feel something sharp winding its way around my neck. Like claws, it stabbed into my flesh. 

I felt my head spin, my vision blur. I was going to die, I thought. I was going to fucking die at eighteen years old, when my replica was out there living my life— and there I was choking on my own blood.

When I dropped to the ground, the Queen cleared her throat. “Speak clearly. You didn’t mean what?”

I couldn’t speak. The words were shredded in my throat.

“She didn’t mean to bad mouth you, Mother.” Jude hissed out. “The… human child has a sharp tongue, and I ask just this once. Please spare her request, and her stupidity. What Ruby meant was a gift,” he said. 

“She will gift you four human children in exchange for your kindness and hospitality. As well as your forgiveness and a seat in the court.”

He wrenched me to my feet and dragged me in a bow. 

My chest was aching, blood dripping from my mouth and chin. But I bowed. 

I bowed three times. And each one was progressively more humiliating. 

When my face hit the ground for the third time, the Queen cleared her throat.

“I accept!” her eyes lit up. “Ruby, you must be so hungry! Please! Eat!”

A table was brought in filled with fruit and berries, and further down the table, a human teenager skewered on a stick. 

His mouth was wide open, teeth pulled out, a bright red apple stuffed inside.

That was when my mind started to slowly break apart. 

When the half human, half fae heirs began to rip flesh from bone, giggling manically, chewing through splattered scarlet dripping from the table. Jude handed me a goblet and told me to drink. It tasted like strawberry milk.  

The windchimes started in my head, growing louder until I was laughing myself, choking on a scream trying to claw its way up my throat. 

When my crown was lowered onto my head, pricks of glass and bone cutting into my scalp, warm blood slipping down my temple, I felt dizzying happiness and unbridled fear, my lips splitting into a grin that wasn't mine. 

I was home. 

I don't know how long it had been since the feast. 

Since the crown on my head stopped hurting, and blood started like tasting like milkshakes.

I was dancing, a whirlwind of color around me, dancing inside the wooden cage, dancing for my life. If my audience did not like my dancing, then I would be punished. 

I was twirling around and around, my thoughts cotton candy, until I stamped on something. 

Something…sharp. 

Something that went straight through my bare foot. 

A nail. 

The pain was enough to wake me up, and when I was blinking rapidly, drinking in the pooling red I had been dancing in, a river of blood staining my legs, did I look up. 

His crown of thorns was still glued to his head but I could see claw marks where he'd tried and failed to pull it off. 

Levi. 

He was awake.

1p9dmvy,https://i.redd.it/98bplvep044g1.png,Think Unhooking My Bra to Make Her Laugh Was Funny? The Judge Didn't,"To defend his ""girl best friend,"" my boyfriend deliberately pulled down my bikini strap during swim class.





The second it slipped, every guy in the pool started hooting and hollering.





I scrambled to cover myself, but my boyfriend pinned my hands down.





""Why are you covering up? With a body like that, consider it a public service!""





In that moment, everything I thought we had—every sweet memory, every loving gesture—shattered completely.





I finally saw him for who he really was.





You like to laugh? Fine.





Let's see if you're still laughing when we're standing in court.





...





Jax's grip is like iron—he's got both my wrists locked behind my back, and no matter how hard I struggle, I can't break free.





His lips are right against my ear, his breath hot on my neck as he whispers.





""Vera, who are you trying to fool?""





""You're usually such a tease, aren't you?""





""Didn't you just call Sienna a pick-me girl?""





""If she's a pick-me, what does that make you? Some innocent little virgin? You act all pure and innocent, but deep down you're wilder than anyone here.""





""This is just a little taste of what you deserve. Say one more word about Sienna and I swear I'll leak those bedroom videos for the whole school to see.""





My heart sinks like a stone.





So when he swam over earlier saying he'd ""fix my strap""—that was all just revenge for Sienna?





Without his hands holding it up, my bikini top slides completely off and floats away in the water.





There it is—white fabric drifting in front of me—and the guys around us are going absolutely feral, hooting and hollering like animals.





My head's spinning with a mix of humiliation, rage, and shame—everything hitting me all at once.





""Jax, get your hands off me! What the hell is wrong with you?!""





But he just laughs, like this is all some big joke to him.





""Vera, you've got such a sick body. Why not share the wealth with everyone?""





""Consider it a public service, babe!""





The guys are eating this up—some of them are literally getting turned on right in front of me.





Jax's bros are calling him a legend, saying they can't believe he'd strip his own girlfriend just to give them all a show.





Someone whistles.





""Damn, Vera's always so quiet in class—who knew she was hiding all that under her clothes?""





""Jax, you lucky bastard!""





""That body? Shit, I can't even imagine—""





""Jax, let go of me!""





""This is sexual assault! I could call the cops right now!""





I'm fighting like hell but the harder I struggle, the tighter he squeezes my wrists—





I can literally hear my bones creaking under the pressure.





When I threaten to call the cops, Sienna chimes in from the sidelines with this fake-sweet voice. ""Girl, he's your boyfriend. You really gonna have him arrested over this?""





Jax scoffs at me like I'm being ridiculous.





""You? Call the cops? You don't have the guts.""





""I'm your boyfriend, Vera. You report me and everyone's gonna think you're some psycho girlfriend who can't take a joke.""





In Jax's eyes, I've always been this soft, meek, timid little thing who'd never stand up for herself.





Makes sense—when we first met, I was this helpless girl getting harassed by two drunk creeps.





Chapter 2





It was summer, about a year ago.





I was eating Korean BBQ by myself at this late-night spot near campus.





Out of nowhere these two wasted dudes slid into the booth across from me and started running their mouths—asking for my number, saying they'd take me somewhere ""fun.""





I ignored them completely, which apparently pissed them off.





Then one of them straight-up put his hands on me, grabbing at my arm.





The whole restaurant could see what was happening, but not a single person stepped up to help.





I'm yelling at them to back off, telling them I'm calling the cops if they don't stop.





That must've set him off because he raised his hand to slap me right across the face.





But the slap never came—





When I opened my eyes, Jax was standing between us, his hand catching the guy's wrist mid-swing.





""Hitting women? That's pathetic, dude.""





Then Jax's fist connected with the drunk's face, and all three of them went at it until the restaurant staff called 911.





We all ended up at the police station—me, Jax, and the two drunks.





Jax took on both of them and somehow walked away without a scratch, while those two looked like they'd been through a meat grinder.





Since it was self-defense, the drunks got detained and Jax got released.





Outside the station, I couldn't stop crying—partly from shock, partly from relief.





Jax looked annoyed by my tears.





""Why are you crying? You didn't even get hit.""





That just made me cry harder, and I managed to choke out between sobs, ""I've never... I've never been to a police station before.""





Then he actually laughed at that.





He ruffled my hair and told me to get home safe, that it was late.





I mentioned I was a student here, and he said same.





When I told him I went to Ashford University, his eyes went wide with surprise.





""No way—me too!""





Our whole meet-cute was straight out of some cheesy rom-com, like a total hero-saves-damsel moment.





Maybe it was guilt, maybe I felt like I owed him my life or something—either way, from that day forward I was basically glued to Jax's side.





I'd bring him breakfast every morning, buy him coffee between classes, pick up medicine when he was sick, wait outside his lecture halls.





One day he looked at me with this knowing smile and asked:





""Vera, do you like me or something?""





Under the golden sunset light, my face went burning red and I couldn't meet his eyes.





Then he leaned down and kissed me, soft and sweet.





""Good,"" he whispered against my lips. ""Because I like you too.""





So when did everything start going wrong?





Probably junior year—right around when Sienna transferred in.





Chapter 3





I'm biting my lip so hard I can taste blood, barely holding myself together as I force the words out.





""Jax, we're done. This is over.""





""And I'm pressing charges against you—count on it.""





Jax absolutely hates being threatened, especially in front of other people.





His smile vanishes instantly and his grip on my wrists tightens until I can feel my bones grinding together.





""Vera, what the fuck did you just say?""





""Say it again. I dare you!""





Sienna tries playing peacemaker, stepping closer with this fake-concerned expression.





""Girl, Jax was just messing around with you. Why are you being so dramatic about this?""





Ha. Stripping your girlfriend naked in front of a crowd of guys? That's just ""messing around"" to them.





The other guys start piling on too. ""Jax, dude, you're so whipped right now!""





""Can't believe you're getting bossed around by your girl like this.""





Jax lives and breathes for his reputation—me embarrassing him in front of his boys is the worst thing I could possibly do. His jaw's clenched so tight I can actually hear his teeth grinding together.





He scans the pool area and calls out, ""Anyone got their phone on them?""





My stomach drops like a stone.





What the hell is he planning now?





Phones aren't allowed in swim class for two reasons—one, water damage risk, and two, the school doesn't want people taking creepshots.





Sienna immediately raises her hand. ""I brought mine.""





Jax grins at her, and it's the most predatory expression I've ever seen on his face.





""Perfect. Take pictures of her—all of her, just like this.""





""She wants to threaten me with cops?""





He wrenches my wrists back even harder, and pain shoots up both my arms like fire.





""Vera, you go ahead and call the cops if you want—I'll blast these photos all over the school forum for everyone to see.""





""Let the whole fucking campus see what a whore you really are.""





Sienna whips out her phone without hesitation and starts snapping away at me.





Click click click.





She's actually grinning while she does it. ""Girl, your body is absolutely unreal! If I were a guy, I'd be completely obsessed with you too!""





Only after she's taken what feels like dozens of photos does Jax finally release my wrists.





I stumble forward a couple steps, nearly losing my balance.





The second I'm free, I grab my bikini top that's still floating in the water and dive underwater as fast as I can.





Can't let any of them see me cry—I won't give them that satisfaction.





But underwater, I completely lose it—tears streaming down my face and mixing with the chlorinated pool water.





I'm struggling to get my top back on with shaking hands, biting my lip so hard I taste blood to keep from sobbing out loud.





Jax, you absolute piece of shit—I swear I'll make you pay for this humiliation a hundred times over.





By the time Coach White comes back to our section of the pool, everything looks completely normal again.





I made up an excuse about feeling sick and asked him for permission to leave.





Coach White looked at me, swaying like I was about to pass out any second, and asked worriedly what was wrong.





When Jax heard me say I wasn't feeling well, he let out this dismissive scoff.





""Coach, she's totally faking it.""





""I saw her running five miles this morning—how could she suddenly feel sick now?""





I bit my lip and turned to look at him.





He winked at me, his eyes full of challenge.





Sienna chimed in with fake concern. ""Vera, you can't just lie to get out of swim class.""





""That's really not cool.""





""Come on down, I'll practice with you.""





When I first signed up for electives, I'd planned to take dance.





But Jax secretly changed my elective to swimming—the same class he was in.





I can't swim. I'm actually kind of scared of water.





But he said, ""That's exactly why you need to learn!""





Later I found out the real reason—he wanted me to keep Sienna company.





After all, the swimming elective was full of guys, and Sienna was the only girl. He didn't want her getting harassed or groped.





To convince me to take swimming, he even bought me a swimsuit himself.





Back then I thought it was so sweet—my boyfriend personally teaching me how to swim.





Turns out that swimsuit would become the very tool he'd use to humiliate me.





Coach White looked between the three of us, then finally chose to believe me.





""If you're not feeling well, go rest. If something happens to you in the water, it could be serious.""





I thanked Coach White, and the second I walked out, I pulled out my phone and called the police.

Synopsis: When the affair of Jack, the wealthy and notorious founder of the Jackal coffee shop empire, comes to light, his wife, Betty, becomes his greatest enemy; she devises a plan to ruin him and take his empire away from him.

No interest in being a candidate. But would be super interested in roles on campaigns or working for a congressman etc. Not opposed to finance roles (background in finance) but strategy / operational roles would be amazing. 

Any opportunities in the space that an M7 MBA would help me with? No real experience in politics beyond low level volunteering and stuff like Young Democrats. There is a somewhat high profile Congressional race in the district I live in that I might get involved with next year.

I’m 27 and the youngest manager at my company that I started at 3 months ago. one of the girl in my crew is 23 and everything started professionally. I never saw her in that way and didn’t even try because I read all the stories here. One day we had to ride together and found out we both like the same things and grew up in the same area before moving to other cities. 

We started off texting through the company phones then switched to personal. Before that she has already shown interest in me by flirting. Now we’ll get coffee and some times lunch together but outside of work we have never hung out even though I have asked but she always says she’s busy. On her way home we’ll talk through the phone and before work. Then some times before she goes to bed and we’ll text no stop. 

She has never asked me to do anything for her from my role and I have never helped her in anyway or given her preference. The other day she asked me how I felt about her and I told her I thought she was cool and wanted to see where things go, her reply was “no comment” with laughing faces, I was like wait what the hell. 

I have analyzed the whole thing and I feel I fucked up. I feel now she was just using me for attention at work, and I feel stupid. at this point I don’t know how to end this and I should’ve been more professional cause of my role. I haven’t had a good night sleep in two days just thinking of how to end this, because the past couple days I’ve tried ignoring her she always calls me or texts me why I’m mad or what’s wrong.

But I’ll still remember this 
What tasted like cheap coffee 
Was tawdry golden bliss

Payphone ate my last dime
My Suitcase lost a tooth 
The night watchmen are off duty
Cause they ran out of vermouth

Between a rock and a hard place 
With a click in my jaw 
I’m steady on my feet 
And I’m quick on the draw

Four sheets to the wind 
Smashed as my left headlight 
My shadow wore my coat
and said it fit just right

To get to heaven

Pack my Molotov cocktail 
Forget my lighter on the floor

lifeOS 26 — stable at times, but enters “brooding + romantic daydream mode” without warning.

Processor:
Dual-core “Procrastinator x Think-Too-Much” 2.0 GHz.
Runs great at night, slow AF in the morning. Boost clock activates only when someone cute texts… or when there’s a deadline.

RAM:
16GB DDR4 — smooth most days, but crashes when too many feelings or thoughts open at once.
Remembers tiny details about certain people, forgets why he stood up from the bed.

Storage:

GPU:
HumanRTX 2060 — decent at social interactions, but renders sarcasm in 4K without permission.
Struggles to render emotions before coffee… improves instantly after a cute compliment.

Stereo-ish. Clear voice but confidence-based volume control.
Goes mute during serious talks but becomes Dolby Atmos when flirting.

Ports:
USB-C for speed, but emotionally? Still USB 2.0 — takes a bit to open up.
Bluetooth works well, but disconnects for “mental peace”… unless he actually likes you.

5G outdoors, but WiFi mentality indoors.
Connection drops instantly if asked, “Tell me what you’re really feeling.”

UI:
Smooth UI with occasional lag when someone flirts too directly.

Total beginner here, just brew cold brew in a jar for the week, but recently trying flash frozen shots and using them for my protein shakes. Wanting to get a coffee pod machine purely for the convenience of it but also looking for it to taste good, not looking for perfection or cafe level good.

90% use case: shots for protein shakes and iced coffees.

Are the Nespresso machines that go 30-50k really worth it? If I could get something from the US what would you suggest? If not, looking to get something from Caramelly.

1p9di70,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p9di70/my_first_love_first_heartbreak/,my first love + first heartbreak,"My boyfriend (26M) of four years and I (25F) broke up two days ago, and I don’t even feel alive.

We’ve been together since we were 21. He’s my first love, my first relationship, and I’m his as well. I love him with my whole heart, and he’s always made sure I was loved too. We went on vacation recently, and I felt like something was “off.” When we got home, I asked if we could talk but not to break up, just to communicate how I was feeling.

A few days later, after a soccer game, he pulled over on the drive home and ended our relationship. He couldn’t even look at me. He was in tears the whole time. He said he loves me, but he feels like he can’t express love fully, not just with me, but with his family too and I completely agree with that feeling of his, I see it. He said he feels so loved by me, but that he can’t give me the love he thinks I deserve. He said something it never “fostered into what he thinks I should be receiving”. He says he is incapable of love, and is scared that he’ll be alone for the rest of his life.

He mentioned he’s depressed, but he never told me that until the breakup, he didn’t need to… I knew all along. He said he decided on Sunday when I said “we need to talk,” and spent days pretending everything was fine over text, but in reality he had 3 days to already cope with us breaking up.

We sat in the car for over three hours because he kept saying he was scared for when I got out, scared because he feels like we’ll never see each other again, scared because where do we go from here, what do we do now?

I never felt unloved by him. I always knew he loved me. Were there things I wished he did more of? Absolutely, but part of me loving him was understanding that he had different ways of showing his love than I did. I do think he struggled to get to a deeper emotional expression. He kept saying I deserved more. He asked me not to have hope, that he wants me to heal and not hope for a reconnection. He said he needs to figure out whether he’s even capable of love. 

I’m heartbroken and confused. I understand he’s struggling mentally, but it hurts that he thinks pushing me away is the best thing for me (Maybe in the long run, I’ll realize it is, but right now it absolutely isn’t, I loved our relationship). I want him to get help. I want him to try medication or therapy. I want him to see that he IS capable of love. But he’s convinced breaking up is protecting me. I was in his shoes at the beginning of the relationship, it’s almost like roles reversed, I was (finally) diagnosed with severe anxiety and he encouraged me to go on medication, I did and ever since then I feel like a new person, and I’ve opened up to him so much more and was able to fully love him.

I don’t have friends I can talk to about this. And I don’t just mean that like everyone says it, I actually don’t have a friend, nor do I have family to talk to because he never met my parents or came over. I don’t know how to get through the days. I feel like I lost him, his family, his friends, everything and worst of all I can’t be there to help him through this either. He said he’ll be there if I need him, and that maybe in the future, far down the road, we could be friends, I almost slapped him in his face, I don’t want to be friends. Right now I feel broken.

I guess I’m asking:
– Has anyone gone through something similar? On either ends?
– Does depression make people push away the person they love? Without realizing they do actually love them?
– How do I start healing when my entire world revolved around him? What do I do now?
– Do I reach out in 3-5 months time, and just ask to grab a coffee?

<Sci-Fi>  

***Black Gold***  

A wet *smack* echoed in the alley as Si took another punch to the jaw, the sound drowned by the rain. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth and she spat out a tooth.

“So,” Oscilla said, wiping the blood off of her badge, “what did we learn?”

“Pway mwoney by nexsht Fwiday,” Si muttered through swollen lips. 

Oscilla nodded at the two goons holding Si in place. They dropped her to to the alley floor. They followed Oscilla out to the street, her green hair glowing in the neon lights.

Si rolled over onto her back and let the rain wash the blood off of her face. She gently probed around the inside of her mouth with her tongue to see if any other teeth had come dislodged, but fortunately it was only the one.

*Count my fae-sworn blessings,* she thought. The wall helped her get the leverage needed to stand but found that her ankle was twisted. *When the fae did that happen?* Not that it mattered. *Fucking cops.*

Limping out to the sidewalk, Si wondered how the hell she’d get fifty-thousand in a week. Even if she sold every organ she didn’t need *and* could get out of post-op after all of that by then, she’d still be short.

Si struggled to navigate the crowded street, everyone else’s umbrellas seeming to aim water directly at her. Someone bumped her shoulder, her balance faltered and she put weight on her bad ankle. With a yelp of surprise and pain, she staggered sideways.

She smacked the wall and swore. Beside her, someone was entering the building and looked at her with a quizzical expression but continued on their way.

The door swung closed behind them and bounced open slightly, sending a waft of scented air at Si.

The scent of coffee. *Fresh* coffee. A plant that had gone extinct decades earlier and was now worth twice its weight in gold.

Someone in there had coffee, and Si had debts to pay.

She opened the door and stepped inside, looking around for the guy who’d just entered, but instead saw a room unlike anything she’d seen before.

No neon lights, or overhead lighting of any kind; just low-hanging lamps with soft orange bulbs, giving the spacious room a cozy feeling. Warm, earth colors everywhere with browns and greens, and almost every surface was coated with some sort of polished wood-looking material instead of chrome or plasteel.

""Wha' the hell ish dish pwace?"" she wondered aloud.

“Welcome to the Fun Tea Friday Cafe,” a tired woman in her forties with short, blue hair greeted tiredly, “where everyday is Friday.” She looked up from a retro model smartphone and the tired expression was suddenly stricken with concern.

“Holy shit, Si, what happened to you?”

“How j’you know mwy nyame?”

Now everyone in the… cafe?... looked at her.

“Merde!”

“Shit!”

“Oha!”

“Fae!”

A half-dozen people and people-shaped things got up from tables and booths and hurried over to her. 

""Everyone, calm down.” The older, blue-haired woman was no longer behind the register. “This is Si’s first time here, y’all know the protocol.”

Gentle enough that Si didn’t even realize it was happening, the woman guided her into a chair.

“But, Dee,” a large, hairy customer said, “look at the state she’s in?”

“Look at her hair, Remus; black, not pink. She’s probably terrified of you.”

Si tried to scowl. “Ahm not-”

“Here.” Dee handed her a small paper bag.

“Whash thish?” Si asked.

“Your lucky day,"" Dee said.

“Hey, Dee, we gotta-” a guy in a duster jacket began.

""I'm just following instructions."" Dee handed the guy a piece of paper.

Si looked in the bag and stopped breathing. Coffee beans. *Dozens* of them. *Hundreds*. While everyone was passing a note around, Si slowly got up and backed away from the table before limping as fast as she could outside.

She bumped into a woman opening the door.

""Woah, careful there,"" the woman said.

Si shoved past the pink-haired woman. She had enough in that paper bag to cover her debts and start a whole new life. She could even buy a TimeJump! Then she could come back and get more...

*""Look at her hair; black, not pink.""*

*""Woah, careful there,"" the woman said.""*

*Did she have pink hair?* Si turned and looked at the door. Hesitating - time paradoxes were *bad* news - she grabbed the door and opened it.

Inside was a lobby. No sign of a cafe at all.

Slim chance you’ll see this, but hey I once believed I could run 26.2 miles for “fun,” so clearly I make questionable bets.

I was out there suffering gloriously in the 2025 Boston Marathon.

You - a cute woman - shouted, “Go daddy, you got this!” near Boston College… at least I think it was Boston College. We briefly made eye contact and both smiled. 

I was deep in the Pain Dimension by then, so everything looked like a blurry combination of cheering students, discarded cups, and my own questionable life choices.

At that moment I was wrestling a monster blister and what I’m pretty sure was a toenail trying to quit its job. Morale was low. Dignity was gone. But your shout somehow made me smile and convinced my legs not to fall off.

I wanted to run back to you but:

	1.	I am shy.
	2.	I was very tempted.
	3.	I was also trying to finish under 3 hours (which, amazingly, I did).
	4.	Turning around mid-marathon would’ve raised some eyebrows and maybe a few medical flags.

If you see this, slide into my DMs. I’d love to buy you coffee or a proper meal - preferably one that doesn’t come in gel form.

1p9d895,https://i.redd.it/w4xftbmrw34g1.jpeg,Bourbon Sidra from Candid Coffee [REVIEW],"Picked this up from Candid Coffee's Tandang Sora branch @ PHP 1,399 for 150g

Flavor notes are supposedly: **Honeydew, Muscat Grape, Tepache**

I was feeling like exploring flavors outside of the usual citrusy & floral notes I tend to lean towards, so I decided to grab it blind. For reference,

I used my usual recipe for trying out new beans:

14g coffee, 210g water @ 93c (my preference)  
88 clicks on the Kingrinder K7 (\\\~56-60 on the ZP6)

1. 45g bloom
2. Pour to 110g at 45 seconds.
3. Pour to 210g at 1 minute & 30 seconds.
4. 2:35 finish on the Hario Switch

**What I tasted:**

It started off very lime-y and quickly coated my tongue with this deeper acidity I'm not really used to. It had a ""sparkly"" finish I haven't really experienced before, but it could just be the acidity trying to shine through.

If I had to guess, this might be why \*\*""tepache""\*\* is in there as a flavor note & it does make sense. Other than that, nothing else really followed except a slightly bitter & smokey finish.

I think the best way to describe it is that it tasted like I'd just pulled a really acidic shot of espresso & stretched it out into an americano. If you've tasted Coffee Tonya's Brazil Bourbon, this tastes like a less bitter version of it while keeping the same level of acidity.

They're both omni roasts rin, so I might just suck at brewing omni roasts.

**Score: 6.5 / 10**

I'm sure this'll be great for people who appreciate a citrusy cup of coffee, but to put ""Honeydew, Muscat Grape,"" and ""Tepache"" as flavor notes when it tastes nothing even remotely close to it was just so disappointing for me. In hindsight, I probably should have tried bringing out the listed flavor notes by changing other brew parameters the 2nd time around, \*\*but I still think it doesn't live up to what it is trying to be.\*\*

I'mma keep this one short-ish, I guess.

About me:  
\- 6'2"" on a good day  
\- a bit bigger. Not dad-bod yet, but definitely not skinny. Working on it  
\- generic white guy in appearance  
\- stupid mustache (package deal, it's a core part of my personality now)  
\- I rate myself as a solid 4 on the best day, but have been told that isn't true  
\- stuck in Kansas until further notice

Hobbies:  
\- cars. My wallet cries constantly  
\- video games  
\- music  
\- writing, sometimes

Let's get the basic small talk out of the way:  
\- Favorite color: Purple  
\- Favorite food: Nearest  
\- How's the weather: Nice and cold  
\- Dogs or cats: Unconditionally love every dog in existence. Neutral towards cats  
\- Morning or night: depends on the day  
\- Coffee or tea: White Monster  
\- Speak other languages: Korean, allegedly

Requirements for you:  
\- Exist  
\- Be of the female variety (negotiable)  
\- 24-29 ish (flexible)  
\- Single mothers welcome\*  
\- be.. interesting in some way  
\- Preferably US based

Anyway, quick overview:

I'm just a dude doing all a dude can do, really. Been single for... entirely too long. Anyway. I spend my free time listening to music and playing video games. What music? Mostly divorced dad rock, but my playlist has been described as musical whiplash before. What games? Simulators. Sometimes something else, but generally sims. What platform? PC. Yes we could probably play together.

Ideally, in person. Open to long distance, though.

Bad at small talk, even worse at talking about myself sometimes. I try, though

Uhhhhhhhh, not sure what else to put in here. At least drop me a message to give me feedback on this.

Oh yeah, left a \* up there:

\* The problem with single mothers isn't really the kid or anything, it's the father. I've given it a few earnest attempts before, but it always comes back around to that.

1p9d3er,https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/1p9d3er/review_austrian_airlines_business_class_vienna/,Review: Austrian Airlines Business Class — Vienna → Washington (787-9 Dreamliner),"Flight: Vienna (VIE) → Washington Dulles (IAD)
Year: beginning of 2025 
Typ: Business Class, Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner (1-2-1 reverse-herringbone)
Booking: Award ticket — booked via miles and more Lufthansa (56k miles + around 400 USD in taxes and fees - booked before dynamic pricing) 

I flew this right after a United Airlines Polaris business class flight (Boeing 777-300ER) and surprisingly — I liked Austrian much more. Here’s why.

⸻

Hard Product

Very modern seat & cabin: The 787-9 business-class cabin features 26 lie-flat “Super Diamond” seats in a 1-2-1 layout with direct aisle access. Great upgrade over older 767s or 777s.  

Privacy & comfort 

The reverse-herringbone layout and shell-style seats give you decent privacy, a good footwell, and a proper lie-flat bed. Storage compartments, power/USB outlets, and a large IFE screen make it convenient for long-haul.  

Excellent meals & service 

Austrian continues to impress with its catering (by DO & CO). The multi-course meal service (starter, soup, main, dessert/cheese, coffee) felt “restaurant-quality”, and the drink/coffee menu (including Viennese-style coffee) was a highlight. Service was friendly, attentive, and consistent.  

Good soft-product tone 

Crew was professional and welcoming; pre-flight drinks, attentive meal service, and general hospitality stood out.

The second weirdest thing about that week was the way Kevin stared at the walls.

The first weirdest thing was that nobody else seemed surprised.

It started after breakfast.

Kody had just finished digging the marshmallows out of Sheep’s cereal when Kevin came downstairs again, same hoodie, same hollow eyes, like he hadn’t slept at all.

He didn’t say good morning.

He walked straight past them, past the TV, past the shoes by the door, into the kitchen where Aunt Natalie was lining up jars like she was about to operate on them.

“Morning, Kevin,” she said, distracted, scribbling in her little green notebook. “There’s eggs on the—”

“Does this make sense to you?” he interrupted.

He slapped a handful of loose papers onto the counter. The pages were covered in symbols and numbers and curved lines that didn’t sit straight on the page, like the ink didn’t want to stay still.

Kody scooted closer on the couch, craning his neck to see.

Natalie blinked, wiped her hands on a towel, and picked up the top sheet.

“Is this… math?” she asked.

“It’s not math,” Kevin said. His voice had that stretched-thin sound, like a balloon about to pop. “Math is just how we pretend to understand it.”

Natalie tried to follow the lines with her finger. There were spirals, half-finished equations, arrows to nowhere. Circles with words in them.

TIME (NOT LINEAR)

SOUL = RECURSION

HEAVEN != UP

Under one diagram, Kody squinted and read:
“The world is held together by an error.”

Natalie forced a little laugh. “You’ve been studying too hard.”

“It folds here,” Kevin said, jabbing at a spot on the page. “Right here. Time doesn’t move, it loops. We just don’t notice because we’re inside the curl.”

“I—”

“And if this part is wrong,” he pushed another paper toward her, “then consciousness shouldn’t even be stable. People shouldn’t be able to stay… people. We should all be falling apart. Constantly. Like—” He moved his hands in and out, like something glitching.

Natalie’s face had gone pale, but her voice stayed calm in that fake adult way. “Kevin, slow down. One sentence at a time.”

“I don’t have time to slow down,” he snapped. “It’s already leaking.”

Leaking.

The word stuck in Kody’s brain like gum.

“Leaking what?” Natalie whispered.

Kevin looked up at her then, really looked, and for a second Kody thought he saw fear in her eyes — real fear, not the “oh no, you got a C-minus” kind.

“Reality,” Kevin said softly. “What else?”

He grabbed the papers back, shoved them into a messy stack, and walked out of the kitchen without another word.

Natalie stared after him, lips pressed together, knuckles white around the towel.

She didn’t notice Kody and Sheep watching from the couch.

An hour later, Mel came home from somewhere. She always came home from somewhere — grocery store, church thing, volunteering, “helping a friend.” She was one of those adults who existed in permanent good-deed mode.

She kicked off her shoes by the door and floated into the living room with a bright, “Hey, boys,” and then, louder: “Kevin? You here?”

Kevin walked out of the hallway like he’d been summoned.

He stopped when he saw her.

Stopped completely.

If someone had hit pause on a remote, he wouldn’t have looked more frozen.

Mel smiled at him, soft and warm. “Hey, honey. You okay?”

He stared.

His eyes… changed.

Not color. Just focus. Like he was seeing through her instead of at her.

“Hope,” he whispered.

Mel blinked. “What?”

“Why are you in this house?” His voice shook. “Why are you here?”

Kody sat up straighter.

Sheep pressed closer to him, thumb halfway to his mouth before he remembered he was “too old” for that and dropped his hand.

Mel laughed nervously. “Uh, because I live here?”

“You don’t,” Kevin said. “Not really.”

The air in the room felt heavier.

Kody didn’t know what that meant, but he knew he didn’t like it.

Kevin took a step back like she was radioactive. “Hope isn’t supposed to be in this house.”

“Okay, Kevin,” she said, still doing the gentle voice, but her heartbeat was visible in her neck now. “You’re scaring the kids.”

He looked at Kody and Sheep like he’d forgotten they existed, then winced, like remembering hurt.

“Right,” he muttered. “Right. Kids.”

He turned away, fingers digging into his hair, and disappeared into the hallway.

Mel stood there for a few seconds, not moving, not breathing, eyes fixed on the space he’d just left.

Then she blinked hard, swallowed whatever expression was trying to climb out of her, and turned back to them with a too-bright smile.

“Who wants grilled cheese for lunch?” she asked.

Sheep raised his hand automatically.

Kody didn’t answer.

He just watched the doorway where Kevin had vanished and wondered since when emotions had names like “Hope” and rules about which houses they were allowed in.

The sounds started in the afternoon.

Kody and Sheep were in their room, pretending to do homework and actually stacking cards into collapsing towers, when they heard it.

The clack.

The steady, frantic clackclackclack of computer keys being abused.

“Dad’s typing weird,” Sheep said.

“That’s not Dad,” Kody said. Gordon typed slow, thoughtful, like he was punching guilt into every email. This sound was too fast. Too alive. Too desperate.

They crept down the hallway.

Gordon’s office door was open just enough for them to peek.

Kevin sat in his chair, hunched over the keyboard, eyes locked on the screen. His fingers blurred. Kody had never seen anyone type like that. No pauses. No errors. No looking down.

The monitor was full of symbols. Not English. Not code Kody recognized from the few times he’d watched Kevin write website stuff. This looked like someone had smashed math and poetry and programming together and dared it to make sense.

Lines that read like:

IF soul >= fracture THEN duplicate(memory)

and

VAR mercy = false;

and

FUNCTION door(open) { return ALL_TIMELINES; }

The printer whirred to life beside him.

Pages rolled out, one after another, after another, building a white skyscraper on the tray.

Kody counted under his breath.

Ten.
Twenty.
Thirty.

He lost track somewhere around fifty.

Sheep tugged his sleeve. “We’re gonna get in trouble.”

Kody didn’t answer.

He couldn’t look away.

Kevin never blinked.

Finally, the printer stopped. The room hummed with the ghost of its noise.

Kevin stood, scooped up the stack of papers — thick as a phone book — and held it like something fragile and dangerous at the same time.

“It’s leaking,” he whispered to himself. “Maybe he can still patch it.”

He turned toward the door.

Kody yanked back so fast he smacked into Sheep and they both fell into their bedroom doorway just in time to pretend they were Very Busy Not Eavesdropping.

Kevin walked past them without looking, down the hall, through the back door.

Kody scrambled to the window and lifted the blinds a fraction.

Outside, Kevin crossed the yard to Grandpa Ervin’s shed.

Ervin opened the door before Kevin could knock, like he’d been waiting.

They spoke.

Kody couldn’t hear the words, just saw Kevin thrust the stack of pages into Ervin’s hands. The old man’s face drained of color as he flipped through them.

Kevin said something, sharp and short.

Ervin nodded once, jaw tight, and pulled him into the shed, closing the door behind them.

Kody let the blinds drop.

“What was that?” Sheep whispered.

“I don’t know,” Kody said.

But he knew what it wasn’t.

Normal.

It was almost dark when Kevin finally came to their room.

Kody and Sheep were mid-argument about whether video game bosses counted as “real evil” or “fake evil that didn’t matter” when the door pushed open without a knock.

Kevin filled the doorway like a storm cloud.

His eyes were rimmed red, but not from crying. From lack of blinking.

He walked in and sat on the floor between their beds, cross-legged, like he used to when they were younger and he’d tell them ghost stories and then swear they weren’t real.

“Come here,” he said.

That was already wrong. He never used that tone with them. Too serious. Too old.

Sheep slid off his bed first and sat in front of him. Kody followed, slower.

Kevin put a hand on each of their shoulders.

His grip was too tight.

“Listen to me,” he said. “And don’t interrupt. Okay?”

They both nodded.

He took a breath like he was about to dive underwater.

“Heaven is not what people think,” he said. “You need to know that.”

Kody frowned. “What do you—”

“Don’t interrupt,” Kevin repeated, sharper.

Kody shut up.

“Heaven is not up. It’s not clouds or harps or a reward. It’s… not where most people go.” His fingers dug a little deeper into their shoulders. “Because most people don’t go anywhere.”

Sheep’s mouth fell open a little. “What do they do?”

“They stay,” Kevin said. “Here. Over and over and over. This place doesn’t end when you die. It just shuffles you. New name. New body. Same cage. Same… rules.”

Kody’s chest felt tight. “You mean—reincarnation?”

“Sort of.” He made a face like the word tasted wrong. “It’s more like respawning in a game you never chose to play. And every time you think you found the exit, it’s just another level of the same map.”

“That’s Hell?” Sheep whispered.

Kevin looked at him, surprised.

“Yes,” he said quietly. “This is Hell.”

A silence hit the room like something physical.

Cars passed outside. A dog barked down the street. The house made its usual settling noises.

None of it sounded the same anymore.

“The world is out of sync,” Kevin continued. “Something ancient is waking up through the cracks. The rules are going to change. People like… us get caught in the middle when that happens.”

“People like us?” Kody echoed, very softly.

Kevin’s jaw tensed. “I don’t have time to explain that yet. Just—just remember this: if something happens to me, it’s not because I disappeared. It’s because they took me. Or because I left on purpose.”

“Who’s ‘they’?” Sheep asked.

Kevin hesitated.

For the first time that day, he looked scared.

“Everyone,” he said. “And no one. It’s… not important now. What’s important is that you pay attention. To what people say. To what they don’t say. To what feels wrong even when everyone pretends it’s fine.”

His fingers loosened on their shoulders.

He looked suddenly exhausted.

“I’m sorry,” he murmured. “You’re too young. I shouldn’t be putting this on you.”

“Then don’t,” Kody said, the words slipping out before he could stop them. “Just… get help. Or sleep. Or something. You’re freaking us out.”

Kevin gave a small, broken laugh.

“I tried getting help,” he said. “They gave me pills and fluorescent lights and called it a day.”

He stood up, rubbing his face with both hands.

“I don’t have much time before they drag me back there again,” he muttered. “I just wanted you to know it’s not… all in my head.”

He left before they could ask what “there” meant.

He didn’t make it through the night.

Not really.

The shouting started sometime around midnight.

Kody woke up to Gordon’s voice, low and angry, and Mel’s, higher and shaking. He couldn’t make out words, just the sharp edges of them.

Then a different voice. Deeper. Familiar in a not-family way.

Mr. Alvarez.

He lived two streets over. He’d known Kevin since he was a kid. He was one of those adults who didn’t talk down to teenagers, which automatically made him suspicious and trustworthy at the same time.

Kody slid out of bed and crept to the top of the stairs. Sheep followed, silent as a shadow.

Down in the living room, Kevin paced in circles, hands in his hair, eyes too wide.

“I’m not crazy,” he was saying. “I’m not, I’m not, I’m not—”

“We know, son,” Gordon said, in a tone that meant he didn’t believe that at all.

“There’s something wrong with the world, not with me,” Kevin insisted. “Everything that’s happening is—”

“Kev.” Mr. Alvarez stepped in front of him, palms up. “Listen, man. I’ve been where you are. Remember? When I was your age? I thought everything was a sign. I thought numbers were messages. I thought the radio was talking to me.”

“It is talking to you,” Kevin snapped. “To all of us. That’s what I’m trying to tell you.”

“I also thought that,” Mr. Alvarez said calmly. “And you know what helped?”

Kevin glared.

“Letting some people who aren’t inside my head look around in there to make sure nothing’s broken.”

“I don’t have time for them to call my brain broken just because it’s faster than theirs,” Kevin said.

Mel wiped at her eyes. “Kevin, please. Just… just let them help. For me.”

He flinched at that.

“Hope,” he whispered again, like the word hurt. “Don’t ask me to go back there.”

“We’re not asking,” Gordon said. “You’re scaring your brothers. You’re scaring everyone. This isn’t up for debate.”

The word “brothers” hit Kody like a physical thing.

They were talking about him.

This was about him.

Mr. Alvarez put a hand on Kevin’s shoulder. “Ride with me. We’ll talk on the way. Nobody’s gonna lock you up. They just want to help you sleep. Get some distance from… all this.”

All this.

Kevin sagged, shoulders dropping like the strings holding him up had been cut.

“Fine,” he muttered. “But if they try to shut it down again, it’s going to break worse.”

Nobody answered that.

They walked him to the door like he was being escorted to a bus he didn’t want to get on.

Kody pressed his back against the wall, heart pounding.

Kevin looked up the stairs as he passed.

For one second, their eyes met.

And Kody could’ve sworn — sworn — that his brother saw him there in the shadows and chose not to say anything.

Then the door opened.

Cold air rushed in.

Footsteps. A car door. An engine.

Silence.

The next time they saw Kevin, he was… smaller.

He came back three days later.

No hoodie. Just a plain T-shirt and hospital bracelet dangling from his wrist like a tag.

His eyes were heavy-lidded, unfocused. His speech came out thick, like he was chewing it.

Mel fussed over him. Gordon took the discharge papers. Natalie hovered in the doorway, watching like she was examining cracks in a wall.

“Hey, boys,” Kevin said.

The voice was his, but something was missing behind it. The sharpness. The too-muchness.

Kody felt relieved for exactly half a second.

Then he saw the way Kevin’s hand shook when he reached for a glass of water, and the relief turned into something else.

“Are you okay?” Sheep asked bluntly.

“Yeah, little man,” Kevin said. His smile didn’t reach his eyes. “They just gave me some stuff to help my brain chill out.”

“Do you still see… leaking?” Sheep asked.

Kody kicked him under the table.

Kevin stared at his little brother for a long moment.

Then he sighed.

“Nah,” he lied. “All patched up.”

Weeks blurred after that.

Kevin slept a lot.

When he was awake, he moved slow, like someone had filled his limbs with wet sand. He watched TV without reacting. He sat at the table during meals but barely ate.

Gordon said the medication needed time.

Mel said healing wasn’t linear.

Natalie said nothing, just wrote more in her notebook.

Kody tried to pretend things were getting better.

But sometimes he’d catch Kevin staring at a corner of the room like it was bending.

Or watching Mel with that same too-knowing expression.

Or twitching when the printer made a noise, even if it was off.

And once, late at night, Kody passed his brother’s door on the way to the bathroom and heard him whispering:

“It’s still leaking. They just dimmed the lights.”

The morning Kevin disappeared was a Wednesday.

Kody remembered because he hated Wednesdays. They were too far from the weekend on both sides.

He woke up to the smell of burnt toast and the sound of Gordon swearing at the toaster. Normal.

Sheep drooled on his pillow. Normal.

Birds outside shrieked like they were auditioning for a horror movie. Normal for their neighborhood.

Kody rolled out of bed and pulled on the same jeans from the day before. He padded down the hall, rubbing sleep out of his eyes, and paused outside Kevin’s door.

He always checked now.

Just to make sure he was still there.

He knocked lightly.

“Kev? You awake?”

No answer.

That wasn’t unusual. Heavy meds. Heavy sleep.

Kody hesitated, then turned the knob.

The door opened.

The room felt wrong the second he stepped in.

Not messy-wrong. Kevin’s room was always messy. Clothes, books, scribbled notes everywhere.

This was… quiet-wrong.

Air-wrong.

The curtains were half-open, letting in a thin gray light. The bed was unmade. The blanket thrown back like someone had gotten up and forgotten to fix it.

The window was closed.

The window was locked.

Kevin’s shoes sat by the wall.

His wallet was on the dresser.

His phone lay on the nightstand, plugged in, fully charged, with yesterday’s date still glowing on the screen.

“Kevin?” Kody said, louder.

Nothing.

He checked the closet. Bathroom. Under the bed, even though that was stupid.

Empty.

His stomach did a slow, cold flip.

He walked around the room again, slower, looking for anything that said where Kevin had gone.

There was nothing.

No packed bag.

No open window.

No note.

Just… an absence. Like someone had cut Kevin out of the scene with scissors and left the outline of his life behind.

Sheep appeared in the doorway, hair a fluffy mess. “He not up?”

“He’s not here,” Kody said.

Sheep shrugged. “Maybe he’s with Grandpa.”

“His shoes are here. His phone is here. His wallet is here.”

“So?” Sheep said.

“So where would he go without his shoes, his phone, or his money?” Kody snapped.

Sheep’s face scrunched. “…Bathroom?”

“He’s not in the bathroom,” Kody said.

They stared at each other.

For the first time since the exorcism, Kody saw real fear in his little brother’s eyes.

They went downstairs together.

Mel was at the stove, poking dead toast with a spatula. Gordon sat at the table with his coffee, reading the news on his phone. Natalie flipped through her notebook. Ervin hadn’t come in from the shed yet.

“Where’s Kevin?” Kody asked.

Four adult heads lifted at once.

“What do you mean?” Mel said.

“He’s not in his room,” Kody said. “Like… at all.”

Gordon frowned. “Did you check the bathroom?”

“Yes,” Kody said.

“Closet?” Natalie asked.

“Yes.”

“Outside?” Mel suggested weakly.

“His shoes are in his room,” Kody said. “His phone. His wallet.”

The word hung there between them like a dropped glass.

Something cracked behind Gordon’s eyes.

Mel’s hand flew to her mouth.

Natalie stood so fast her chair tipped.

Kody watched all of them react — not with confusion, not with “oh maybe he went for a walk” — but with a kind of quiet, horrified understanding.

Like this was the exact thing they’d been waiting to happen.

Like a countdown had just hit zero.

“He didn’t go anywhere,” Kody said, voice shaking. “He’s just… gone.”

No one corrected him.

No one said that was impossible.

No one told him he was overreacting.

And that was how Kody knew, deep down in the part of him that stored all the stuff adults never confirmed:

Whatever had been leaking had finally broken through.

And it had taken his brother with it.

Apologies if this isn't the correct sub. Will very much appreciate your inputs.

I had an internal sliding door moved (basically moved aside from one end to the other end on the same wall) in an unfurnished apartment. Got several quotes with similar pricing around $3500 and same timeline, that the job will take 3 days.

I decided to go with this guy who said just moved down to Melbourne and restarting his business. He got business name, ABN, and insurance, but my mistake for not asking to check his licences.
Prior to my decision, he gave pretty good first impressions when he inspected the site. Sounds easy to deal with and reasonable. He made notes and scribbles on a template form he created and then sent a detailed quote with work timeline.
I paid deposit of 30% before work starts and then 25% as progress after first day ends. He emailed a progress report as well.

I asked if the wall had insulation prior it was torn down, he said it didn't. On day 2 he offered to install insulation into the wall and I aggreed $200 to do that.

He worked on this project with one other guy and 3 days passed (Wednesday to Friday) and the job hasn't finished for whatever reason. I think he said it was more complicated than he thought.
He asked to work over the weekend, which is against strata rules but he tried to make it happen anyway, (I'm sorry my neighbours). He worked Saturday and Sunday, and hasn't finished.
I had another project slated and booked for the apartment, so that had to go through first on the following Monday to Wednesday. And I did mention this to him prior.
Then he came back to work on Thursday and Friday, afterwards still have some finishing need to be done.
Some outstanding items:
- A skirting board hasn't been installed
- A skirting board was probably cut too short and joined, but the joint is immediately visible
- Uneven paintings
- Carpet was cut too short

He asked for full payment, that I said I can't. I'm more than happy to provide progress payment, but not full payment until all the above items are addressed.
He claimed that he has completed the project 100% and these items are rectification.
Said he's losing money because the project got extended for so long. When asked why it got prolonged, he said due to unforeseen circumstances. Like what? And he can't answer that. Then blames the insulation installation. I said you offered it and you didn't mention any timeline extension at the time.
He demanded payment again and I said no.

He took a hammer and said he's going to smash the walls. So either I pay up or the hammer goes into the wall. This is his work and because I haven't paid in full, he's free to do whatever he wants with it.
I just stayed silent, then he proceeds to pack up and go home.
Afterwards he sent a text asking about the payment.

What should I do? 
At this stage, does the project considered complete? 
I feel I have been trying to be as reasonable and accommodating as possible. I put in a small fridge in the apartment and stock it with bottled water and coke. I bought lunch and coffee twice for them.
For most part I think he did good and he cleans up pretty well.
But I'm also worried about my personal safety.
I no longer want him to come back to the site. Should I send a notice that I don't feel safe and barring him to attend the premises?
I don't mind cutting losses (i.e pay him in full just to complete my obligation) and move on.
Thank you.",92,1764382712.0,AusRenovation,79,0.93,False

I’m really hoping vets or people with experience can help me understand what is happening with my dog and what the kindest next step is. I feel completely lost and heartbroken.

Background:
About a week ago, I brought my dog(3 years old male) to the vet and he was confined for four days. He had a catheter placed and was on multiple medications. The vets recommended surgery, but we couldn’t afford to continue the confinement or the surgical costs. Even though it wasn’t advised for him to be discharged yet, we had no choice but to take him home on Day 4.

At home, we tried our best to continue his care. We fed him the prescribed urinary diet and gave some of the medications, but not all, because we couldn’t afford everything that was prescribed. We were really hoping he would stabilize, but things have gotten worse.


His symptoms now:
- Pale gums
- Straining to pee only a drop or two comes out no matter how hard he tries
- Can still walk to his water bowl, but is extremely tired and mostly sleeps
- Drinks water frequently, but his body doesn’t seem to tolerate it
- Vomiting different types: (undigested food, clear water, foamy, yellow, brown, dark coffee-colored liquid (which I’ve read can be blood) and earlier he had wheezing during the last part of vomiting
- Barely eating, last night he ate a little, then today only about 5cc and even that tiny amount comes back up
- Seems alert but exhausted and avoids eye contact
- Breathing a bit fast like in out motion
- Any food or water seems to upset him
- He’s still trying to pee and drink, but his body clearly can’t handle much

What I feel right now is that I feel like we’ve done a lot already took out loans for his emergency confinement, meds, catheter, prescription diet, home care but at the same time, I feel like it wasn’t enough and that I should have done more. I’m heartbroken and confused because I can see his body is giving up. Even tiny amounts of food or water don’t stay down.

I’m also struggling because he seems to be telling me he’s tired, but I don’t know if I should let him pass naturally beside me or take him for euthanasia.

My concerns about the decision:

If I let him pass at home, I know he’ll be beside me, in a familiar place, without the stress of travel or strangers.
But euthanasia might prevent suffering. I just worry the clinic environment and new people will stress him out in his last moments.

I also don’t know if his condition is still treatable at all. At this point, he can’t tolerate food, vomits different substances, can’t pee properly, and his gums are pale.

My questions:
1. Based on these symptoms, is his passing likely very close (hours to a day)?
2. Does this sound like active organ failure that cannot be reversed without intensive vet care?
3. Would letting him die naturally at home likely be painful or distressing?
4. Or is euthanasia the kinder, more humane choice at this stage?
5. Do dogs in their final hours still get up and walk around a little, like how he still walks to drink before lying down again?

I don’t want him to suffer. I just want to make the right choice for him. Any guidance, especially from vets, would mean a lot. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.",3,1764382681.0,DogAdvice,10,1.0,False

1p9d112,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p9d112,"Trip Report for Hong Kong, 4-night stay.","Trip Report for Hong Kong.

My travel was 1-month in China and 4-night stop in HK from 16th August – 19th September 2025.

My travel route was Beijing – Luoyang – Dengfeng – Kaifeng – Chongqing – Zhangjiajie / Wulingyuan – Furong – Fenghuang – Wangxiangu – Hengdian Film Studios – Shanghai – HK.

I hope this information will be useful for those planning a trip to China. I’ve tried to list and describe as much as possible and highlighted some important parts. I’ve added AUD prices, the hotels that I stayed at, reviewed attractions that I visited in each city or town. Its my first time writing such a report and detailed itinerary so please be kind with the feedback. Feel free to ask questions and I will respond as soon as I can. Thanks for reading!

**HONG KONG = 4 nights** and this was my 6th time to HK – I will return again and again!

I flew with Cathay Pacific from 9:30am Shanghai to 12:30pm HK for $158 AUD (which includes a second 23kg checked baggage piece – extra cost) and I booked directly on their website. After collecting my suitcase & duffle bag, **I picked up my Octopus card at the airport (pre-booked via Klook) and used the Airport Express Train (also pre-booked via Klook, return trip) to get to Hong Kong metro station.** From here, I caught a local double-decker bus to my hotel = THE ARCA, 4 nights for $472 AUD, booked via Expedia so I could use some points to reduce the cost, otherwise it would have been $627 AUD.

**HOTEL: The Arca is a really nice, modern hotel and less than 10min walk to Wong Chuk Hang metro station (on the South Island line – lime green color, close to Ocean Park).** I chose the Sea Signature Room which was huge = 30 sqm and has a king bed, TV, bathroom with stand-up shower stand, western sit-down toilet, mini fridge, coffee machine with daily refills of coffee pods, tea, sugar etc. Water is available on each floor from a special machine where you can select hot, warm or cold, and fill up your water bottle or use the jug provided in the room. The main reason why I chose this hotel is for the harbour view (see first photo attached). By the time that I checked into my hotel, it was 3pm. I explored the hotel and had a look at the rooftop pool (great views & is used by guests – I rarely see anyone in a hotel pool when I check, see 2nd photo attached) then took a 10min walk to the **Southside mall that’s connected to Wong Chuk Hang metro station** for a late lunch, shopped around and stocked up on drinks / snacks for the next few days. Dinner was takeaway and back at the hotel since I was buggered and wanted to enjoy my lovely room!

**NOTE: HK hotels are expensive so if you’re willing to stay out of the city centre and tourist attraction areas (like Central – Causeway Bay – Tsim Sha Tsui – Mongkok), you will get better value for your money... like a bigger room, more amenities and better facilities. Ideally, find a place that’s close to a metro station and bus stop so you have some transportation options. I believe the metro trains and buses stop running by 11pm, depending where you are and where you’re going to? I haven’t used a HK taxi before so I don’t know how much it costs but I’m assuming, its expensive...**

**HK E-SIM:** I used this one for HK from Trip.com https://au.trip.com/things-to-do/detail/57498874
**For 4 nights / 5 days, I used less than 3GB and only paid $2.88 AUD because I had some Trip.com points that I could redeem! Dirt cheap!!! If you’re only using data to navigate around HK, research opening / closing times for attractions, places to eat, you won’t need much data.** I have Nord VPN on my mobile phone and I turned it off during my stay to avoid any issues. I was able to access social media apps and communication apps like Whatsapp, FB Messenger, Viber, and checked my hotmail emails, google search stuff with this e-Sim so I highly recommend it. I will happily use it again! I don’t use TikTok so I don’t know if it will work with this eSim.

**CHINA E-SIM:** I forgot to mention which eSim that I used for China in my Trip Report, so here it is = I used this one for CHINA from Trip.com https://au.trip.com/things-to-do/detail/57501862 and its currently listed as **China Mainland 5G/4G eSIM | DayPass / Total | 500MB/day - Total 30GB | 1-30 Days | 24-Hour Billing | QR Code**. ** I travelled around China for 30 days and used roughly 22GB. So this 30-day / 30GB eSim for $24 AUD was more than enough for me. As long as you don’t you-tube, netflix, stream videos, you won’t need a lot of data. I thought Alipay and WeChat would take up a lot more data but it didn’t. I only opened the apps when I needed to pay for something, text the hotel or text people. I was able to access social media apps and communication apps like Whatsapp, FB Messenger, Viber, and checked my hotmail emails, google search stuff with this e-Sim so I highly recommend it. I will happily use it again! I don’t use TikTok so I don’t know if it will work with this eSim.

**HK TRANSPORTATION:** Definitely get an **Octopus Card and top-up with cash at the metro stations.** I topped up 50 HKD, several times, during my 4-night stay. **HK metro and bus rides are about the same price as Sydney, Australia**, its not cheap like China (aw, man!). Each time you ride the metro (see photo 3 to 6 attached) or bus (see photo 8 attached), depending on the distance, you’re looking at least 10 HKD, one way. A few times, I paid around 30 HKD for a 45min bus ride. **I recommend trying the bus to get around HK (not just the metro train) so you can enjoy a more scenic route (views out the window, see photo 7 attached).** Use **Google Maps** to figure out your way around. **If you want to use some bus apps to plan ahead – see schedules / route options, download: APP 1933 – KMB / LWB or hkbus.app – HK BUS ETA and install before you arrive into HK (to avoid or minimise issues accessing their apps).** 

**PAYING FOR STUFF IN HK**: HK has their own **HK Alipay app** and (from my understanding) you need a Chinese / Taiwanese / HK mobile phone number to register. But, not to worry! If you have the **China Alipay app** you should still be able to pay for some things – I did! **Just ask the vendor or shop staff if you can and I negotiated the price (depending on current exchange rate with HKD, RMB and you’re home country to get the best value).** It worked just fine, as if I was back in China! I’m assuming, many places in HK have the China Alipay app as a payment option as they do get lots of visitors from the mainland… so don’t be shy, ask!!!

Other options to pay is via **Google Pay** (tap your mobile phone away!), you can use the **Octopus Card** (to pay for stuff at certain stores, restaurants and cafes) or **you scan the QR code, fill out your details and credit card information to pay** (I did this once on the day that I arrived for late lunch at a restaurant). **Some vendors at Ladies Markets and other street stalls around HK do prefer cash, so it’s definitely a good idea to have a bit with you and especially small notes.**

**ATTRACTIONS:** Here’s a list and review of the places that I visited on this trip to HK...

**HK Heritage Museum with Bruce Lee and Jin Yong exhibitions**: this is a bit far from the city centre but its 5min walk to a metro station and its **free entry**. I spent less than 3hrs wondering around in here (but you could easily spend 4hrs+ if you have kids), checking out all the halls which included the usual traditional art, Buddhism sculptures, ceramics, antiques, etc. The best exhibitions are Bruce Lee and Jin Yong as its most unique. **You can take photos everywhere in this museum but not in the Bruce Lee exhibition so don’t travel all the way here if you want to take photos in the Bruce Lee exhibition – cause you can’t and there’s cameras / staff monitoring.** I was sad that I couldn’t but its an incredible exhibition about his life – not just the movies (outfits, props, are on display), information about his martial arts academy, family, etc with photos, videos, etc. I found **the Cantonese Opera exhibit (similar to Sichuan Opera)** also very interesting and **the HK film, TV & music industry section** awesome (lots of video clips to watch – cast & crew interviews, costumes, posters, memorabilia stuff) and there’s a children’s section that I didn’t visit... I was really hungry by then, so I left and had lunch at the cafe (connected on the ground floor) which is a really popular spot (busy, crowded)... they serve western food, good value/price/serving (you will be full!).

**HK Museum of Art**: this **free-entry** museum is right next to Avenue of Stars so you get a wonderful harbour view from above. There’s quite a bit to see, if you wander into each hall, so allocated 2hrs+. It has a mixture of modern and traditional art like calligraphy, floral paintings, etc. **Near one of the windows overlooking the harbour view, there’s a few tablets on tables where you can fill out a 5min questionnaire to find out what traditional Chinese career you could have had with your personality / character** – I thought that was cool! I did the questionnaire twice and both times it said I would have been a Scholar – Official! There’s also a very impressive exhibition called **Art of Gifting: The Fuyun Xuan Collection of Chinese Snuff Bottles and it was one of the best that I have ever seen!** I highly recommend visiting this hall as it had over 100+ snuff bottles for to you admire – the detailed artwork, the craftsmanship, the designs, patterns, colours, shapes and sizes are really beautiful and fascinating. How people made these miniatures, without the technology and equipment that we have today, is really incredible.

**Avenue of Stars**: Now, if you visit Hong Kong and don’t come here, then you really didn’t visit Hong Kong (see photo 18 to 20 attached). **This is the place to see the harbour view, especially at night when its all lit up! During the day time, you can walk along this promenade and check-out all the hand-prints (like Hollywood’s Walk of Fame) of Chinese internationally-known celebrities like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh to more Asia-recognised celebrities like Andy Lau, Leon Lai, Aaron Kwok, Tony Leung, Jacky Cheung, Cecilia Cheung, James Wong, Stephen Chow, Sammo Hung, etc.** What I found disappointing about this attraction is that the hand-prints are placed on the hand railings that face the harbour view so its difficult to take photos with and from eye level: you have to hold your camera / mobile higher up and take the shot looking down. The last time that I visit the Avenue of Stars was in 2017 and the hand-prints were on the ground so you could walk around them, sit next to one and take a photo with them = like how the Hollywood Walk of Fame is. Anyways, while you are here, if you can, walk the full length (will take you less than 20min if you don’t stop to take photos?) and take a photo with the **Bruce Lee statue** which is located near some restaurants and cafes towards a ferry boarding dock / pier.

**K11 Musea Mall**: This is a high-end brand shopping mall. Its right next the Avenue of Stars. I didn’t buy anything here but its **a great stop for the toilet, some much needed air-con and lunch in the food court**.

**Harbour City Mall**: On the left-side of **Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry Pier** and next to the Marco Polo HK Hotel, is the popular Harbour City Mall. It has a mixture of high-end brands, local brands, restaurants and cafes etc. Many tourists / foreigners visit here. I came for the toilet and to visit the Popmart store haha

**Tsim Sha Tsui area**: If you like walking around, I recommend exploring this area by foot. Besides the places mentioned above, I suggest to walk through streets like **Middle Road, Hankow Road, Peking Road, Ashley Road, Minden Row, Mody Road, Carnanvon Road**, as there are some good HK souvenir shops, lots of malls like Isquare and K11 Art Mall, plus the infamous **Chungking Mansions on Nathan Road**. I always wander around this area and find lots of things at buy at great prices but you do need time to browse and of course it depends on what you want to buy. **Its a tradition for me take the 45min walk from Mongkok Ladies Market (see photo 10 attached), down Nathan Road and check-out the shops along the way, to the Avenue of Stars. This walk helps me see the changes in HK and I detour off the main road to places like Temple Street Night Market (see photo 11 attached) which is located closer to Jordan metro station.**

**In between Yau Ma Tei & Jordan metro stations**: other notable attractions are **HK Avenue of Comic Stars** (I haven’t visited properly, I’ve only seen and stopped to take photos with the **two staircases that lead to the attraction from Nathan Road (see photo 16 attached)**, **Kowloon Park**, **Yau Ma Tei Jade Hawker Bazaar** (I visited years ago and didn’t buy anything, best to go only if you know jade prices and quality really well)… I like the souvenir shops along **Park Lane Shopper’s Boulevard**, and there’s **Mira Place Shopping Mall and The One Shopping Mall** nearby, if you have time.

**Mongkok**: is worth visiting and not just for shopping but for the food too. I’ve walk down **Sai Yuen Choi Street for electronic goods, Tung Choi Street / Ladies Market, Fa Yuen Street for sporting goods & footwear** many times. It’s not all cheap so know your brand and prices, focus on what you want or need to buy, otherwise, you will probably waste money and need another suitcase to lug it all back home! **I bought a bunch of nylon foldable tote bags for around 10 HKD each (price will vary depending on size, design and vendor) at the Ladies Markets, with HK retro art pictures, Pokemon characters, Hello Kitty, Snoopy designs etc. I think these were the cheapest items that I got on this HK trip. They’re very handy to have to carry your shopping, snacks and drinks whilst travelling, plus they make great gifts as they’re lightweight and don’t take up much space in your suitcase.**

In regards to food in Mongkok, I recommend eating at any of the popular busy restaurants and cafes – there’s so many places packed with people and a wide variety of cuisines, I don’t think you can go wrong with any of them. I know you can’t always assume the quality of food is better if its a crowded eatery but it does indicate its a decent place otherwise it would have closed down already? As you should know, real estate / rent is not cheap in HK, so for any business to be crowded, has queues or crowds, than it has to be good. Check google reviews, if needed, to confirm and decide...

**Causeway Bay**: I visited this area for shopping. You could spend a whole day just walking from street to mall here… I visited **Times Square, Percival Street, Jardin Bazaar Crescent, Don Don Donki aka Don Quixote Japanese store (to see what they stock compared to Japan stores = same but there’s more variety in the Japan stores), Sogo Department, Causeway Bay Plaza, Fashion Walk, Windsor House** in half a day. I mainly focused on buying cute cartoon stuff except for **Decathlon** where I bought a pair of casual sportswear type shoes.

**Central**: Every time time I visit HK, I explore this area and see many changes. The streets that I always visit are **Li Yuen Street, Fa Yuen Street, Pottinger Street (see photo 17 attached), Peddler Street and I wander around the entry of the Central-Mid-Level Escalators**. I’ve been on these escalators before, years ago. This **Soho** area is also nice to visit and its popular hang out at night for the cafes, bars etc. There’s the famous **ICF Mall which is connected to the HK metro station** and I really enjoyed walking through **Central Market** which is like a block away, where I had lunch before I caught the airport express train back to the airport to fly home...

**Lantau Island**: I’ve been here before, many years ago, before the cable car line to the island was built. So, I joined a day bus group tour (booked on Klook) to visit **Po Lin Monastery & Big Buddha (see photo 14 attached), Tai O Village where Jackie Chan filmed Police Story (see photo 12 & 13 attached), took a 20min boat ride to see pink dolphins – and we did! rode the Ngong Ping cable car (I took the standard cabin, not crystal bottom one) which gives you great views of the airport haha (see photo 15 attached)** and it was a pleasant trip. **You can definitely do this trip on your own, independently, just note down the bus times and check the routes so you don’t waste time waiting around or have to backtrack to get to where you want to go.** I left the tour group after the cable car ride to visit **Tung Chung / Citigate Outlets** which was really disappointing = very expensive compared to my last visit here, many years ago… I only bought a few things from the **Disney outlet store** which has left-over items from previous seasons and at reduced / clearance prices – which is good. I had a steak dinner here in one of the local restaurants, on the higher levels, which was nice!

**In case you need more ideas and inspiration on what else you can see or do around HK, here’s a list of other places and attractions that I’ve visited on previous trips:**

**Victoria’s Peak with the Tram Ride** during the day and at night = recommend

**Madame Tussaud’s**

**Repulse Bay, Stanley Markets** – part of a day group tour stop, just looked around = don’t go out of your way to visit this

**Disneyland** – visited within 3 months of its opening, so more than 20 years ago now…

**Ocean Park** – been here twice and recommend a full day visit so you can see / do everything!

**Central area including Hollywood Rd, Cat St, Man Mo Temple, Tramoramic** = heritage tram ride with the audio headphones experience which I recommend doing, if you have the time and want to sightsee sitting down...

**Chinese Traditional Junk harbour city cruise** - once is enough, I think standing at Avenue of Stars is enough for the view.

**Chin Lin Nunnery & Nan Lian Gardens** – if you love visiting temples and want a quieter experience, go here.

**10,000 Buddhas Monastery** - wow, I really enjoyed visiting this place!

**Wong Tai Sin Temple** – famous / popular temple, visit if you have time.

**Snoopy World inside New Town Palace, Sha Tin** - I’m a Snoopy fan so I had to go here, shop in air-con and have lunch.

**Sky 100 Observatory Deck & Cultural Centre** – went years ago, its great but the glass windows reflect in your photos which I hate…

**HK Museum of History**

**completed a Dim Sum cooking class** – fun activity to do with friends and you eat what you cook!

**joined a group day tour to take you to the lesser known areas of HK, the neighbourhoods where you can walk into a typical HK apartment and see how small and how expensive HK is** - recommend doing if you want access to the inside of a typical HK apartment, look on Klook, Trip.com, get your guide, Viator, Tripadvisor for the best tour to join...

**joined a day group tour to Macau with Porta do Cerco crossing point into China, with visit to Senado City Square, Goddess of Mercy Kun Iam, St Pauls Ruins, A-Ma Temple** – I recommend joining a group tour so the logistics is sorted for you, you don’t have to worry and wait around to get to each attraction and they give you plenty of time to explore each place.

**joined a day group tour to Cheung Chau Island with visits to Pak Tai Temple, Tin Tau Temple, Kamfa Temple / Golden Flower Shrine adjacent to Peng Chau Wing On Street** - if you want to visit some of the islands and their attractions, to see the highlights... You’re on holiday, so let someone else guide you around for a day or two…


**FINAL THOUGHTS**: I’m a city girl so I will never get sick of visiting HK. **I love HK! Most visitors, either love HK or hate HK.** I think, HK is quite similar to Tokyo, Osaka, Shanghai, in terms of the lights at night, the atmosphere, how busy and crowded the city is or can get. There’s lots to see and do but it really depends on your interests to determine how many days or nights that you should spend in HK. **I suggest a 4-night stay (so you have 3 full days to sightsee) for a first visit and if you want to shop a lot, go to Disneyland, or Ocean Park, take a ferry to Macau then add an extra day for each of these places.**

There are still many places that I haven’t visited and areas that I haven’t explored in HK. **HK is the only city in the world that I enjoy as a stopover, every few years if I can, as it feels like home to me! Its an Asian city but really Westernised so I feel comfortable coming here again and again. There’s lots of English signs everywhere, its really easy to use their public transport system even at 10pm, its safe!** I consider HK a multi-cultural city, a gateway to the east and west, a fusion of old and new, a real interesting mix of architecture, history, culture, cuisine, modes of transportation, etc.

**The only thing that I really don’t like about HK is the humidity. I suggest to visit a mall for lunch so you’re out of the sun during the hottest and brightest time of the day, can access a toilet, give yourself time to relax with some air-con – plus your legs and feet will need regular breaks, and massages, because HK is a city worth exploring on foot!**

Thanks for reading. Thats it. No more trip reports from me for a while now... til next year...

I hope this is useful information and advice and I hope you all enjoy visiting China and HK! Safe travels!
