I (37 m) smoke weed every night around 8 pm, started a couple of months ago. It is something that put me behind piano for boring practices and I like it very much just for this effect. But I'm not as active as I was before. I also drink 2,3 cups of coffee per day which I know contribute to my anxiety.

I started Lexapro 3 days ago, 10 mg - 5 mg - 5mg ... and I continue smoking but lowered my consumption.  
  
Right now I cannot sleep well. I feel lethargic and depressed. I had panic attack last night and I don't know if this depressed feeling is gonna be persistent every morning or not because it takes a toll on me.

Can I continue smoking cannabis with these symptoms ? Why I'm not in a mood for playing piano ? I also feel I have much more focus when I take the med but in a robotic way since I don't hear that much inner thought which was part of my artistic personality.

Everybody says hang it there but I feel really helpless now. I appreciate you share your experience.",1,1740060582.0,lexapro,0,1.0,False

1itz7bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pessimism/comments/1itz7bb/this_isnt_some_happy_happy_wonderful_dna_ride_and/,This isn't some happy happy wonderful DNA ride and there is no end goal to be had here.,"I don't get it. You create a robot. Program it with negative status effects like thirst, hunger etc. Now satisfy them as its creator. Now create more robots to satisfy the needs of existing robots. Now you have a self sustaining system. Scale it to 8 billion robots. It's terribly inefficient, millions stay deprived of their needs. What have you achieved?

Looking at the real world, the system isn't merely just 8 billion robots part of an inefficient need fulfillment system, it's worse. There's trillions and trillions, a web of species caught up in an ecosystem of enormous suffering. Every robot is susceptible to harm.

The 'code' for every robots functioning wasn't strung together by the careless happenstance of physics but the death and deprivation of trillions of robots. On top of that, the suffering and death of trillions of bots of other species are the yearly expense of the maintenance of the 8 billion robots. For the vast vast majority of life's history, many many children died for every 1 that lived. It was a numbers game, and suffering was taken for granted. It happened for over 2 billion years and the amount of suffering is incalculable. And what's the end game of all of this? We sit in the clouds and cycle through addiction and fulfillment endlessly? Is this the end goal for humanity? How can we justify the suffering that is experienced and will continue to be experienced to achieve it? The horrors endured and will continue to be endured by so many conscious beings.

Every desire we've ever had, let's not pretend that there was some actual intellectual reason for it. It's ultimately to chase a 'feeling', to fulfill our addictions. There isn't any reason to do anything in this universe because there is no objective value. Most values are based on feelings, sourced from this pre programmed addiction game. You are accomplishing nothing.

All these animals, left to their own devices, they just consume each other, defecate and multiply repeatedly just on and on, prolonging the suffering, ignorantly. Eating, sleeping and fucking doesn't justify anything. The wild is a cruel fucking place, a suffering machine. We aren't any different, the nature of our societies are the same, it is simply obfuscated by sophisticated systems. The functioning of the world depends upon the active exploitation of millions of us and the torture and death of trillions of animals. Pleasure at the expense of the suffering of another. If the sufferer's had an instant opt out button, the world would cease to function.

We are ignorantly reproducing, birthing more humans into this meat grinder rat race of limited resources. We manufacture suffering to threaten the working class of it. And the older generations complain of a 'weak new generation' who don't know suffering. They complain that we are privileged. It makes me so fucking irritated. How they justify that 'coffee', 'sunsets', 'mountains', 'beauty', 'video games', 'tv shows' is so worth it makes no sense to me. How can any of that justify the suffering that exists. You aren't special. You are just the same as the rest of us. People should get raped, tortured to death just so some fuck can keep having coffee? and sunsets are worth watching? the simple life is worth living? Like come on. If I could trade every single moment of happiness that I've ever experienced in my life, from the sight of every sunset, beach, mountain, hill, every bit of beauty, every bit of joy I've ever experienced in my life to prevent a child from experiencing chemotherapy I would. The suffering and the joy were never valued the same, not ever. If you wouldn't make that trade, that tells me a lot about you already.

Life is just making the harm-able and harming it. There's no sense to it. The price paid is enormous and the reward is just meat sacks thinking they're accomplishing something. We are inefficient by design. The human condition necessitates suffering. Humans cannot exist in a perfectly equal system. 'Meaning' is just an excuse, rooted in 'feelings'. There is no profit to be had here. The end goal is just the minimization of suffering. There's no point. Pleasures are just comforts, a feeling of not being dead, it's a delusion of profit. The system is one that is constantly descending into infinite loss, but its agents are designed to justify it so that it's played infinitely. It doesn't make sense to add new agents to the game. Stop daydreaming that this is some happy happy wonderful dna ride. It's a disgusting system with no purpose. It's reproducing for the sake of reproducing at an enormous fucking price. Optimistic nihilism is silly to me, there is no justification for any of this. Live your life how you want to but adding a next generation is where I see a problem. I'm not asking us to live in misery. I'm only asking that we never create another generation and continue this cycle of nonsense.",1,1740060267.0,Pessimism,0,1.0,False

Great, now I’m gonna be tired on my date.



Unfortunately ghosts don’t have lungs, so they can pretty much scream as long as they want. Night, day, doesn’t matter. If they wanna wail they will.



My ghost’s name is Alfred Barton. At least, I think that’s who he is. Despite my many desperate pleas Alfred won’t talk to me (unless screaming counts).



Alfred is haunting the house that I own, and he’s *emphatically* trying to scare me off. We are currently in a war of attrition to see who cracks first.



I hop in the shower to clean myself up. I’m hoping the cold water will help me wake up as well. I’m under the water for approximately ninety seconds before I hear the pipes groaning in the walls, and I duck right before the blood starts spraying out of the showerhead.



Great, now I’m gonna stink on my date.



Apparently Alfred was a solitary guy in life. He had a family, but my best guess is they hated him. People with loving families don’t become vengeful spirits. That’s pretty much reserved for angry, spiteful, assholes, which is exactly who I’m dealing with.



Personally, I don’t think it’s fair. Alfred can scream all night long, or make blood run from the faucets, but I can’t do anything to him. He’s dead. It’s not like I can wait until he falls asleep and scream in *his* ear. Frankly, he’s got nothing to lose.



At least, that’s probably what he thinks.



The doorbell rings and I answer the door and greet my date: *Annie Barton*. I invite her in so I can use the bathroom before we go to a Monster Movie Double Feature at the Cineplex.



There’s a chill in the air and I know that Alfred is watching, which is good. I want him to see who I’m dating.



You’d be surprised what you can find out about someone by looking at their Instagram page. Their relatives, where they go to grad school, the Coffee Shop they work at on the corner of 5th and Main.



With all that information, all I had to do was let the air out of one of her tires and wait. That’s all it took for us to meet! I helped her put on the spare, we struck up a conversation, and she offered to buy me a cup of coffee as thanks. Now we’re dating!



I really like her, I might even end up marrying her if she gives me the chance.



Or, maybe I’ll chop her up into little pieces and bury her under the floorboards so Alfred can have some company.



I haven’t decided.



Or, I should say *Alfred* hasn’t decided yet, because it all depends on his actions.



I say all of this out loud in the bathroom so Alfred knows I mean business, and then I turn on the sink.



Perfectly clean and regular water.

1itz5zu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1itz5zu/the_great_heavy_ammo_drought_ended_10_years_ago/,THE GREAT HEAVY AMMO DROUGHT ENDED 10 YEARS AGO TODAY!,"Here's the Megathread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/2wj4ub/news\_x%C3%BBr\_megathread\_022015\_022215/](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FDestinyTheGame%2Fcomments%2F2wj4ub%2Fnews_x%25C3%25BBr_megathread_022015_022215%2F&data=05%7C02%7C%7Caab1009f63014993c98a08dd515ebc08%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638756189499546472%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=PZDFtaEzkLjSGwvESu2a1L5fk6wXH1wLQ8VNs0bgngU%3D&reserved=0)

The Great Heavy Ammo Drought of 2015 was the culmination of several events. First, and foremost was the failure of that snake face bastard Xür to sell heavy ammo synths (which were the only guaranteed way to get heavy) from January 12th until February 20th. (Actually he didn’t sell it the two weeks prior to the weekend of the 9th either.) Apparently, this was not intentional on Bungie’s part, but also not easily corrected. This left the only source of heavy as Banshee, who charges an unbelievably high rate of 950 glimmer (which was a lot back then) as glimmer was originally capped at 15K).

Second, was another technical issue that caused heavy ammo to be lost from inventory on death. If you died with 5 rockets, after a wipe you might only have 2.

Third, was the release of Crota’s End Hard Mode. The hard mode raid required primarily two things. A skilled sword-bearer and rockets. Unfortunately, sword-bearers were in somewhat short supply since a bug (caused by the fire team leader disconnecting their connection) would keep poor Crota on his knees while a maniacal guardian hacked away. This led to unskilled fireteams and guardians entering hard mode. The Crota HM mechanic required one sword-bearer, one guardian to distract 2 or more boomer knights, and the rest to drop the sword-bearing knight and then drop Crota’s shield. This latter task was almost exclusively accomplished with rockets fired simultaneously.

Now back then Crota wasn't the pussy he later became. Back then Crota had special abilities. He could blink all over the damned place, sometimes coming into the crystal room after your ass.  One time Crota jumped off the bridge and chopped me like firewood as I tried to run into the Ogre room. Another time he came through a goddamned wall into the crystal room. And it wasn't just Crota. The sword knights and Ogres back then we're unionized, and would often take coffee breaks when they were supposed to make an appearance. All of these factors contributed to an abundance of wipes. After each wipe you could count on having little or no heavy ammo, and staring at a dwindling or missing inventory of synths.

The salt was the highest in the game at that point.  Any wipe could start huge fights, often resulting in guardians getting kicked or leaving. LFG was in its infancy, and many players did not have established clans or friends lists. This led to open requests and playing with many more randoms. More randoms led to more breakdowns in communication, further increasing wipes. Breaks would sometimes need to occur during the raid for one or more members head to the Exclusion Zone to farm glimmer then visit banshee.

Finally, enabled by a patch, Xür brought heavy ammo. I combined many resources and vault slots and bought 480. I’m sure there have been saltier periods over the last 10+ years, but the Great Heavy Ammo Drought was certainly up there.  But if you have a minute today, you might pour out a few rockets in to commemorate a Destiny milestone.

1itz5gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1itz5gr/quixels_guide_to_refilling_pods_facts_and/,Quixel's Guide to Refilling Pods - Facts and Personal Opinions,"There is a lot to consider here. Results and opinions are mixed, but there are some solid facts to consider. I will try to lay them all out plainly. 


# Facts #

You can get kits on Amazon that let you reuse the pods, and packing with your own coffee grounds is much less expensive.

This can (potentially) damage your machine and void your warranty. Please read your terms of sale as using reusable pods or refilling used pods can void your warranty. It has been reported that Nespresso Customer Service has said that, if you send your machine in for repair, they can tell if you use refillable/refilled pods by the damage such as grounds buildup, scorch marks from grounds burning, and the ricochet of the stainless steel pods.

But, when you think about it, the machine is a relatively small part of your cost. Let’s break it down.

 - Machine: $130 
 - ⁠Pods: $1.25 (averageish)
 - ⁠Kit: $20
 - ⁠Rough cost of refilling a pod: $0.30 (grounds + foil)

## An Example ##

Let’s say you drink 1.5 pods per day on average. Over the course of a year, that’s roughly 548 pods.

Those pods would cost $685 to buy new at the price listed above.

Those same pods would cost about $165 to refill (plus your time). With the refill kit, that puts you at $185.

Over the course of a year, you could save as much as $500, and you could almost buy 4 machines with that savings. And you only have to do that if/when your machine breaks.

Note: The prices of the pods and machines will vary over time. It's always best to do your own research and math on this based on current prices of machines and pods as well as your personal consumption habits.


# Considerations #

It's your choice, but doing so should be done with the full understanding of the implications.

I have seen claims that the stainless steel refillable pods ricochet (think of an unbalanced washing machine) and that the foil/silicone lids are not going to seal like the manufacturer’s seal. I personally have not had an issue with this.

# My Opinion #

It’s important if you’re going to do it that you first understand the terms of sale and of the warranty and that this can break your machine. If, like me, you are okay with that risk, proceed with caution.

Also, make sure to get a good seal and use the foil stickers. Don’t cheap out on them either. Get the well reviewed ones. I personally would recommend refilling the aluminum pods instead of getting the reusable steel ones, sealing them *very* tightly, and staying near your machine while it’s brewing to listen for abnormal sounds and to abort if needed. 


# Disclaimers #

Do your own research and search around for personal stories. There are plenty of folks who do it successfully, but there are just as many who have had their machines destroyed and can't even get a discount because they violated their terms of sale, and Nespresso has been able to tell. 

I have tried to present the facts and my opinions here. Your results may vary, and I cannot (and do not) make any guarantees of your success or of what may happen to your machine. 

# tl;dr #

Be careful. Understand the risks of damage and voiding the warranty. The math may work out in your favor. YMMV",1,1740060124.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

for the longest time, i thought it was. i thought self-care was supposed to be soft, gentle, pretty. the kind of thing you could take a picture of and post with a caption about “treating yourself.” and sometimes, that kind of self-care is exactly what you need. sometimes, a slow morning with a warm drink and a cozy blanket is healing. sometimes, a small luxury does make a difference.

but real self-care? the kind that actually changes you? it’s not always beautiful. it’s not always fun. sometimes, it’s uncomfortable. sometimes, it’s the hardest thing in the world.

self-care is forcing yourself to do the things you don’t want to do but need to do.

it’s finally folding the laundry that’s been sitting in a pile for days, because you know deep down that waking up to a clean space will make tomorrow easier. it’s forcing yourself to eat something when you have no appetite, because your body needs fuel even when your mind is exhausted. it’s getting out of bed and taking a shower after three days, even though it feels pointless. it’s drinking water instead of another cup of coffee because you’re already running on fumes and dehydration won’t help.

self-care is making the hard choices, the ones that don’t come with immediate rewards. it’s going to therapy even when you don’t feel like talking. it’s journaling when your emotions are a mess instead of shoving them down. it’s setting boundaries with people you love and accepting that some of them won’t like it. it’s saying no when you desperately want to be the person who always says yes.

it’s choosing yourself when it feels unnatural.

self-care is deleting the number of someone who makes you feel small, even if part of you still wants them to reach out. it’s staying home when you’re emotionally drained, even if you’re afraid of disappointing people. it’s finally making that doctor’s appointment you’ve been avoiding for months.

it’s doing what’s necessary, not just what’s comfortable.

sometimes, self-care looks like getting outside for five minutes of fresh air, even when you don’t want to move. sometimes, it looks like choosing sleep over another hour of scrolling. sometimes, it looks like sitting with your emotions instead of running from them.

it’s not always pretty. no one claps for you when you make the tough choices. no one sees the small victories. but those small victories? they add up.

She said it was stupid, which i get that from her perspective it might sound stupid, but for me it s a new interesting thing that makes my life more interesting amongs the mundane every day life. 

Like, i work part time, i take care of my dogs, i m comfortable with a lot of tasks, like editing, i can do that for hrs, i m always on time, probably since my whole day revolves around that, so my boss know he can always count on me whenever, but he doesn t require of me to attend the office daily. I ve been working 12 hrs without any problem since we are flexible, and then i can have a day off, or two or three, or work from home which is good. 

But other than that i do feel like a kid, i don t understand most of the people around me, i prefer to socialize with animals or being alone, working on my projects, my best friendships were with some ppl that i can effortlessly be myself around, but the older i get, the more i realize that it s so hard meeting these kind of ppl. Especially someone who shares my interests or is so excited about theirs, someone to have meaningful conversations with, going in depths of things, i cannot stand another coffee over gossip section, so i isolate myself. 

I moved which makes it next to impossible to meet anyone. And then i find a new thing i get so excited about, and looking with the other perspective yes i sound like a kid in a candy store, but those are the things thst keep me going. Other than that it s so damn isolating and lonely out there. I ve had so many friendships over without ever being explained why, and all of those that truly matters are abroad anyways, and i m so bad at keeping in check over the phone. I know i m not alone in this. 

My iq score is among gifted ones, but i feel so clueless and dumb sometimes and have serious executive disfunction when it comes to my own projects, when it comes to my friends, i m always there to help and do whatever, and am capable of doing shit. And i hate feeling like this. 

I ve been on more antidepressants that i can count, but in my country everything is either anxiety or depression, which i do have both, but the meds aren t medding. 10 years of therapy, and i m nowhere near to resolving anything. My therapist also told me i need to behave as adult but what does that even mean. Work from 9 to 5, hate my life, not have any time for anything, be in a constant burnout from being surrounded by people and not get excited by collecting ""stupid"" things? 

I guess i m just venting, sorry everyone, i m sure there are more meaningful posts here, i just needed to vent, and my chatgpt told me to find like minded people, which for the life of me i can only seem to find online. ",2,1740059929.0,AutismInWomen,1,1.0,False

My story begins on December of 2023. I went for an exam on my university and there I met a girl. I am 25M and she is 23F . We got to know each other and we started going out maybe once a week. That continued for almost 4-5 months and I have to mention that nothing sexual ever happened. At some point I started developing feelings and I decided to be straight to the point the next time I saw her (that happened in may 2024) she gently refused by telling me that she has stopped dating for almost 2 years now and she is not searching for someone. Although we stopped meeting she was sending me messages now and then , but since I felt I did my part and I was clear that I really do like I was not as engaging as before (never took the initiative and in general I dint want to “hunt” since I was clear). That was the dynamic since this November after I returned to the city I attend university. She sent me a message if I am in the city and if I would like to go out for a drink with her , (that came as a surprise since we never have done something like that in the past , mostly going out for coffee etc.) I accept her proposal and after 3-4 minutes she asked me if I’ve eaten anything and since I haven’t she invited me to her house to eat together before we go out. I do not kid you I looked at the sky and wandered “what have I done for something like that to come out of the blue”. I go there and we catch up. Then she asks me on my opinion about a relationship advice for her sister. I give her my honest opinion and we leave it at that. Then i go back home to get ready to go out with her. At first everything was perfect we were having fun. Then she froze. I could tell that someone went inside the bar so I casually asked her “is it someone new or from the past” she told me that it was from her past. I let it slide until he started flirting with some other girls inside the bar which drove her to overdrive , she started crying and then confronted him with screams etc. the story about her sister was never real , it was hers , she started a relationship during the summer and she broke up with him the previous night. I felt like I was used and I should leave right then and there but the good part inside me didn’t want to leave her in that state of hysteria. I called a cab and we went back at her home (it was 3-4 am) she begged me to sleep at her house so he will not come back or anything. Foolishly I did (nothing happened again and I didn’t try anything as well). Since then we became close with each other and eventually I was ok with being just friends with her since with what just happened I was really put off in a more romantic approach. So she comes to my house almost everyday and at some point she started complaining to me that I never send her messages first and so on. I told her that’s just the way I am but the complaint went and went and went for a long time. In late January I told her “look I can understand you but if I start actively searching you out and so on I am gonna catch feelings again and I don’t really want that after last may” which it looked like it intrigued her. Also a few days prior we organised a trip in my hometown for the upcoming carnival. Since then she became super engaging , she wants me to look the best for the carnival , we are having matching costumes and so on. Also she spent almost 2.5 hours in order to practice my make up. She came with me to buy the costume and so on. With all that and some messages that I took as flirting on her part (although I brushed them off as friendly banter the moment she sent them) I started catching some feelings again. She told me at some point that her best friend told her that she believed that we are gonna be together in December or January. I answered to her that if she ever asked me for sex during those month I would decline her. She seemed a bit mad about it and I explained her that since she was not over her ex at that point there was no reason for me to become a tool for her. Which she seemed to understand. Also apart from a hug during the start or end of our meetings there is no other physical contact. Another thing I would like to mention is that last time we were together my mother called me and she took initiative to talk to my mother. Also she sends me photos of her costume by saying “now I am gonna drive you crazy” and indeed she looked way too good. Last thing I want to mention last 2 times we met up there were a few friends of mine for board games where we all played together, there I didn’t feel any kind of flirting between us. So in one hand I have a few hints that it might be something in the air and in the other hand is that my brain just is making stuff up and she capitalises on the attention I give her. I don’t know what to do .. I don’t want to do what I did last may .. I already did it once and I don’t want it to be even more awkward since we became closer since then plus I think she had many chances If she feels the same way . I am sorry for this huge story . What do you think about this situation ?? I would love to hear your opinions 


Forgot to mention that we both have discussed that there is no friendship betweeen women and men (I can get your views on the matter but this is something that we both agree on) although it is an oxymoron since what are we ?? ",2,1740059805.0,Friendzone,0,1.0,False

1ityyjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/sheffield/comments/1ityyjr/coffee/,Coffee,"I used to love coffee until I got pregnant and now I only like silly sweet creamy lattes. The caramel nutcracker Costa special really hit the spot but now they don't do it anymore and I'm craving it 😞
Their regular caramel latte just isn't doing it for me, even when I add cream. I think it needs a little something something extra but I can't figure out what that is!

Can anyone recommend a coffee place that does something along these lines year round? Independent would be a bonus but I'm really just trying to get through the day.
Around Eccy road/Sharrowvale would be ideal but also city centre and towards Handsworth would be fine!

I used to hand grind at home but now have a Fellow Ode gen 2 (also at the office) and loved it with my Lavazzo crema a gusto beans at 7-2. Now I’m trying different Lavazzo Qualita Oro beans at the same grind size and it’s very watered down.

Is there a video or chart or anything that recommends how to grind different beans? I’m annoyed by the cost of burning through so many beans with a bad batch. If not that, anybody else love the Lavazzo crema a gusto beans and have a similar recommendation?",1,1740059553.0,Moccamaster,0,1.0,False
1ityy7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ityy7l/how_i_lost_50_lbs/,How I lost 50+ lbs,"Since having my second child and a bunch of autoimmune issues I have ended up at weight 183 and miserable. Now I'm down to 126 and almost at my goal of 120. Here's what I did: 

1. MacroFactor, best calorie counting app. IMO! Do not reward exercise with extra calories for the day. MacroFactor rewards consistent exercise with consistent increases in daily calorie goals. You can see very clearly where you drop off on the exercise and how that changes your deficit over time. Track the trend while weighing yourself every day. 

2. Sort of included with no1 but weighing myself every single day. Yes, people hate it bc water weight etc. It was necessary for MacroFactor algorithm but also had the unintended effect of being exposure therapy for my fear of my own weight. I got used to it going up, down, platoeing and then dropping more dramatically depending on the day of the cycle, water, type of food i ate the day before.
It resulted in a better awareness of how different things affect my weight over time and more mindful and calm view of smaller changes. 

 3. At the very beginning I signed myself up for a half marathon that was 2.5 months away and had to really really get on top of consistent training (I used Nike Run Club), which helped with the initial weight loss and meant I didn't have to go straight to a lot of restricting bc obviously strict exercise accelerated burning calories. 

4. Safe snacks. We always have safe snacks at home. I stopped seeing my usual go-tos as an option. There were no cheat days (Ik it sounds miserable but bear with me), if I really wanted something that was super calorie dense id eat it and track it and then suffer the consequences of having water for dinner or going over my daily goal, slowing down WL. 

 5. The most important one: do NOT be afraid of going over. Obviously always TRY to stay within your limit but do not be discouraged if you ate a big lunch with colleagues that was outside of your control and then starve at home in the evening. Don't do it. Just have dinner. Figure out low calorie dinners you can have - most spices and hot sauces are super low calories. 

Chicken marinated with some spices cooked in the airfryer without oil + some cauliflower rice on the side will satiate you so so cheaply in terms of calories. The amount of options you have is crazy. Soups, salads with lots of vegetables without dressing / croutons, I made ""dressing"" out of 15kcal mayo mixed with crushed garlic and some salt, and had that with plain cooked chicken and a bunch of vegetables.  

Going back to the original point, it doesn't matter if you go over every now and again. What matters is that you stick with your program.

6. Forget about it and live your life. Use whatever restrictions you have in place as a baseline and forget about the rest. Try stay within your own boundaries, if you break them only occasionally - ignore it. You're allowed to. Just be happy and live your life. 

7. Whenever you want to snack - drink a glass of water. 

8. Skip lunch. Just do it. Literally just skip it lol. I found my hunger towards dinner is the same if I do or don't eat lunch. If you struggle with restrictive meals and light dinners, just have your 20-30g of protein for breakfast (can suggest some stuff if you want) and have coffee and water or a <100cal snack for lunch like a light salad or soup. Then you can have a satisfying dinner and not feel like you're constantly eating grass. 

There u go ❤️good luck frens ❤️🌺

1ityxsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1ityxsf/joe_k_part_3/,Joe K - Part 3,"The case remained open but, for now, K was free to go. The only stipulations were for him to stay in the country, maintain regular contact with his lawyer and return to the police station, if and when required, for further evaluation. In need of clarity, he decided to walk home but, no matter how hard he tried, the days events stubbornly refused to make any more sense than the weather, which couldn't make its mind up any more than he could. Was he unsettled by this disruption into his simple, routine life? Was he angry at the authorities for subjecting him to this small miscarriage of justice? Was he morally outraged at the insinuation that he was guilty of something? *Was* he guilty of something? Something he had no conscious awareness of, or didn't realise the full implications of? Did he actually have something to hide? Was *he* hiding from something? Was he depressed by the chief inspector's assertion that he was a ""virtual nonentity"", and the implication that he wasn't quite human enough to count? *Was* he human enough to count? Wasn't he getting a little paranoid, here? Were those CCTV cameras following his movements as he made his way home? Were the curtains twitching in the windows of some of the other flats in Malevich Square, as he quickly walked towards the doorway of North Block? He quickly checked his mailbox and ran up to his fourth-floor flat, three steps at a time, before any of the other residents could *accidentally* bump into him and bombard him with questions he had no answers to, his ignorance almost certainly being misread as evasion.

The relief he felt at the successful completion of this task disappeared as soon as the sight inside hit his eyes, causing them to weep for the first time in as long as he could remember, not for the mess left by this morning's chaotic intrusion but for the tidiness left by the absence of his beloved books. The paper soul of his home had been ripped out. In its place was a solitary, soulless piece of white card informing him of the *Temporary Requisition Order* and a phone number to call for further information.

Although the appetite he'd recruited on the march home had suddenly gone AWOL, he forced himself to make a cheese salad sandwich and was still contemplating the first bite when there was a knock at the door. He opened it to a breath of fresh air carrying the sweet sound of the Welsh Valleys. ""Hey Joe... oh, babes, have you been crying?"" Two slender arms wrapped around him and hugged his wiry frame to her bra-less bosom. It was his neighbour, Katie, and, although he'd been the recipient of this spontaneous gesture many times before, now, instead of making him feel slightly uneasy, he was more grateful for the physical contact of another human being than he'd been in years. Her dark brown curls emitted a fragrance of springtime cherry blossom, and the soft, subtle curves of her body in a Sonic Youth t-shirt and black leggings felt like the physical manifestation of a mid-sixties John Coltrane solo. He had to end it before he completely lost himself in the tenderness of the moment but, when faced with the little sapphire stud in her cute button nose and the magic in her pale blue eyes, he had to take further evasive action. Black magic, he told myself, wicked sorcery beyond her command, sent by the demons of hell to draw me into a world of pain - quick, break the spell. He had to say something neutral to control his emotions and establish an air of formality.

""I'm not sure I can babysit tonight, I'm exhausted. Something terrible has happened - I've been arrested.""

""I know that, silly, I was just getting to sleep when the bastards woke me up. And don't worry about Robbie, he's staying at his grandpa's this weekend, I just wanted to make sure you're alright. Bloody hell, look at this place, did they find what they were looking for? what even were they looking for?""

""Nothing! I haven't done anything wrong, I swear. Please tell me you believe me, no one else does, not even my lawyer, and he's legally obliged to.""

""I didn't know you had a lawyer.""

""Neither did I... Well?""

""Well what?""

""Do you believe me?""

""Of course I believe you,"" she said, and gave him another hug that might have only convinced him because he needed to be convinced. ""Of course, I do get paid to believe everything men tell me so if it's reassurance you're after you might want to ask someone else... I'm joking - come on let's put the kettle on."" It was only when she looked over the lounge from the kitchen that Katie noticed the main difference in K's flat. ""Where's your books, babes?""

""They took them.""

""What, all of them? in a truck? when? was I asleep? why would they do that? when are you getting them back?...""

""Wait, let me catch up... yes... probably... when I was in custody... I guess so... fuck knows... and soon, I hope, I've got nothing to read.""

""Nothing at all? no wonder you're so upset - you need books like I need cigarettes. Well, you can have *Gravity's Rainbow* back if you want, you might've beat me with that one, babes - people think I read difficult novels but what the fuck is going on there? I barely knew what was happening from one sentence to the next... or even within one sentence, to be honest. I was gonna grab another Lispector off you, as it goes, but... I just can't believe it, are you sure you're OK? I know how stressful it can be, I spent five hours in a holding cell once, and all for a quarter of weed - I guess it must've been a slow day. Speaking of which, if you need anything to calm you down, I've still got a bit of that Lemon Kush left from our last film night. Just don't watch *Sin-a-ducky, New York* again - bloody hell, that was one of the most heart-breaking films I've ever seen. They could at least have put a warning at the start - 'This film contains scenes of extreme veracity, do not consume with banging weed'..."" Katie could go on like this forever and K would happily absorb that rapid overflowing river of information, delivered, as it was, by a clear, gentle stream of a voice that floated him far above his usual loquacity tolerance level. On this occasion, he even managed to uphold his end of the conversation. She insisted on hearing every detail about his arrest, which included a brief digression into the *Blackadder* series' - how could she not have seen it? - that failed do it any justice. They shared his cheese salad sandwich, drank their coffees, and he could finally dismiss his worst fears of mental collapse when the cathartic process culminated in a shared belief in the sheer absurdity of the whole wretched business. ""It's more confusing than that crazy rocket book and more random than Slothrop walking around post-war Europe bumping into everyone he knows... bloody hell, I gotta get ready for work.""

Getting ready for work meant putting on her 'Katerina Ivanovna' costume and approximating a Ukrainian accent. She trusted him enough to reveal her occupation a few weeks before she trusted him enough to to ask him to babysit for her son, but he hadn't brought it up since then, fearful of saying the wrong thing and offending her. Feeling that their relationship had reached a new level of intimacy, in spite of his best efforts to resist it, he decided to go with the flow and take more of an interest in her life. ""Do you like being a...""

""Stripper? Yeah, most of the time. It's a lot better than waitressing or stacking shelves or... cleaning... no offence. At least I'm working for myself. The club takes a cut, obviously, but Supervixens are one of the best according to the girls who travel around a lot. They're female-owned and female-run, and the only men who work there are on security - and that's only 'cause guys are less likely to start any nonsense if they see a big man on the door. The best thing is getting to play a role, I always wanted to be an actress.""

""Is it easier when you're playing a role?""

""It's easier to make money. Katya's a lot sexier than me. Also, the clients start imagining your poor, struggling family back home - all those crippled veterans and widowed sisters and starving orphans and old, arthritic grandmothers picking potatoes in a Crimean wasteland. It allows them to convince themselves that buying a private dance is an act of charity, like a stripped down version of the philanthropic delusion.""

""You make it sound like *you're* exploiting *them*?""

""Maybe we're exploiting each other, would that make you feel more comfortable? Or maybe we're both being exploited by our pre-historic genetic programming - you know, the one that makes women attracted to wealth and power and men attracted to youth and beauty. Or maybe we're both exploiting that programming for shits and giggles, but let's be clear about this, Don Quixote, I don't need any knight in shining armour to protect me from the evil patriarchy. I'm a big girl and I can look after myself.""

""I'm sorry,"" said K. ""I didn't mean... I watched a documentary the other night - only because I was curious about what you do, and...""

""Let me guess? - a bunch of neo-fascist pseudo-feminists telling men how to think and women how to behave? These days, you're oppressed if you wear a bikini and oppressed if you wear a hijab, oppressed if you show your tits and oppressed if you cover your hair. Speaking of which, I'll have to cover mine up if I don't hurry up and get in that shower. If you're curious about my job, babes, just ask me. Or come for a drink down the club one night, the girls won't hassle you if they know you're with me... unless you want them to, of course."" Before she left, she gave him another hug, but he was back to feeling uneasy, and, this time, he wasn't the only one. Well done, thought K, after he closed the door behind her, you managed to piss off the only friend you've got left... even without trying to kiss her.

During a thorough tidying up of his flat, K forgot what an idiot he was and remembered what idiots the police were. Then he forgot that and remembered he had nothing to read. Then he forgot why he didn't watched much television, began flicking through its endlessly repetitive channels, and remembered why he didn't watch much television. Still, it didn't feel right to go to bed without a book to read so he fell asleep on the couch, watching an old episode of *Doctor Who* with Tom Baker and the cybermen.

He awoke to the sound of celebrities having breakfast and pretending to like each other, turned off the TV, had his own breakfast and pretended to like himself. Then he turned on the radio and lay on the bed, debating whether to have a shower and get changed, but the music was very relaxing and the presenter reminded him of Katie so he stayed there for a couple of hours. Despite his best efforts, though, the anxieties of the previous day refused to budge, so he went for a long walk. What made him smile was his battered old copy of *Gravity's Rainbow* on the mat outside his door. What made him grimace was the dog shit he stepped in when he got to Bosch Gardens. He took it personally and became angry and uncharacteristically judgemental, wondering which dog's human was responsible. Was it the border collie playing ball? Was it the nervous chorkie barking at everything? Was it the rickety old greyhound whose rickety old human was tearing up a scratch-card and throwing it on the floor in a ritual sacrifice to the god of money? Was it the friendly labradoodle puppy wagging its tail? Was it the cocker-spaniel chasing squirrels? Was it the slobbering bulldog? It was probably the bulldog - he looked a bit shifty and so did his human, glancing up from his mobile phone and pretending not to see K, as if caught red-handed. Of course, he might have just been embarrassed at receiving an explicit picture, or guilty for sending one. Why do some men do that? he thought. No woman actually *wants* to see a picture of a penis, even their husband's, or a particularly impressive one, when they look at their phone, do they? At best, the probability of success must be far enough below the potential to offend to make the risk mathematically untenable. For his own peace of mind, and only in his mind, K formally accused the bulldog, closed the case of the copropodal canine and took himself for a walk around the park, before telling himself he'd been a good boy and deserved a treat - a chicken jalfrezi from the Indian takeaway on Kandinsky Street. They were closed, so he settled for chicken tikka pasty from the Conshop and immediately regretted it. When he got home, there was a message from Clean Knows on his answering machine informing him of a change of location for tomorrow's job.",1,1740059519.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

# [Dow futures drop 100 points as Walmart shares slide after earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/19/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures moved lower Thursday, a day after the S&P 500 hit a fresh all-time high, while retail giant Walmart slid after issuing a disappointing outlook.
*****
> Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 110 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures shed 0.2% each.
*****
> Dow member Walmart dropped more than 7% after the company said it expects fiscal year sales to grow between 3% and 4%. The company’s fiscal 2026 earnings outlook, meanwhile, was also below analyst expectations. The weak guidance overshadowed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that topped estimates.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a winning session, with the S&P 500 on Wednesday posting another record high. The Nasdaq Composite and the 30-stock Dow also finished in positive territory as investors shrugged off President Donald Trump’s warning of more tariffs.
*****
> “We have been using the word ‘resilient,’” Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at JPMorgan Wealth Management said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Wednesday. She added that she expects another high single-digit total return upside from here.
*****
> “We think that 2025 is going to be a year that investors have a chance to build on strength,” Ausenbaugh continued. “We see more room for this market rally to run.”
*****
> Investors also digested newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting. The minutes showed that the central bank’s officials last month agreed that inflation needs to come down more before they cut interest rates again.
*****
> Elsewhere on the economic front, investors will be watching for weekly jobless claims data, which is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.

You create a robot. Program it with negative status effects like thirst, hunger etc. Now satisfy them as its creator. Now create more robots to satisfy the needs of existing robots. Now you have a self sustaining system. Scale it to 8 billion robots. It's terribly inefficient, millions stay deprived of their needs. What have you achieved?

Looking at the real world, the system isn't merely just 8 billion robots part of an inefficient need fulfillment system, it's worse. There's trillions and trillions, a web of species caught up in an ecosystem of enormous suffering. Every robot is susceptible to harm. 

The 'code' for every robots functioning wasn't strung together by the careless happenstance of physics but the death and deprivation of trillions of robots. On top of that, the suffering and death of trillions of bots of other species are the yearly expense of the maintenance of the 8 billion robots. For the vast vast majority of life's history, many many children died for every 1 that lived. It was a numbers game, and suffering was taken for granted. It happened for over 2 billion years and the amount of suffering is incalculable. And what's the end game of all of this? We sit in the clouds and cycle through addiction and fulfillment endlessly? Is this the end goal for humanity? How can we justify the suffering that is experienced and will continue to be experienced to achieve it? The horrors endured and will continue to be endured by so many conscious beings.

Every desire we've ever had, let's not pretend that there was some actual intellectual reason for it. It's ultimately to chase a 'feeling', to fulfill our addictions. There isn't any reason to do anything in this universe because there is no objective value. Most values are based on feelings, sourced from this pre programmed addiction game. You are accomplishing nothing. 

All these animals, left to their own devices, they just consume each other, defecate and multiply repeatedly just on and on, prolonging the suffering, ignorantly. Eating, sleeping and fucking doesn't justify anything. The wild is a cruel fucking place, a suffering machine.  We aren't any different, the nature of our societies are the same, it is simply obfuscated by sophisticated systems. The functioning of the world depends upon the active exploitation of millions of us and the torture and death of trillions of animals. Pleasure at the expense of the suffering of another. If the sufferer's had an instant opt out button, the world would cease to function. 

We are ignorantly reproducing, birthing more humans into this meat grinder rat race of limited resources. We manufacture suffering to threaten the working class of it. And the older generations complain of a 'weak new generation' who don't know suffering. They complain that we are privileged. It makes me so fucking irritated. How they justify that 'coffee', 'sunsets', 'mountains', 'beauty', 'video games', 'tv shows' is so worth it makes no sense to me. How can any of that justify the suffering that exists. You aren't special. You are just the same as the rest of us. People should get raped, tortured to death just so some fuck can keep having coffee? and sunsets are worth watching? the simple life is worth living? Like come on. 

Life is just making the harm-able and harming it. There's no sense to it. The price paid is enormous and the reward is just meat sacks thinking they're accomplishing something. We are inefficient by design. The human condition necessitates suffering. Humans cannot exist in a perfectly equal system. 'Meaning' is just an excuse, rooted in 'feelings'. There is no profit to be had here. The end goal is just the minimization of suffering. There's no point. Pleasures are just comforts, a feeling of not being dead, it's a delusion of profit. The system is one that is constantly descending into infinite loss, but its agents are designed to justify it so that it's played infinitely. It doesn't make sense to add new agents to the game. Stop daydreaming that this is some happy happy wonderful dna ride. It's a disgusting system with no purpose. It's reproducing for the sake of reproducing at an enormous fucking price. Optimistic nihilism is silly to me, there is no justification for any of this. Live your life how you want to but adding a next generation is where I see a problem.

I probably created well over 50 and must have made around $100k. One made $60k, but most others made $500-2,000. Many made $0.

But I like writing, so why not. I don't plan to monetize any of these in any serious way unless they take off, which I doubt. But I want to see if trying different platforms makes it harder or easier to gain followers.

So, I started on Buy Me A Coffee. Here, I plan to document my trade-up challenge to get from $0 to $100k this year. I would like othets to follow along so that we can laern from each other. See https://buymeacoffee.com/tradeup/2025-trade-up-challenge-0-100-000.

2nd blog will be a mindset and building wealth blog. I think I will start this on Wordpress.com. It will be the lessons I learned getting to $1 million net worth. This will be more mindsetand little tricks rather than some step-by-step guide. Mindset is the number 1 thing that helped me build my wealth.

3rd blog is likely to be on Substack or Beehiv. It will be about travel not the usual travel blog style. More me chit chatting about my current travels with my wife.

Which will work best? I have no idea. All will be fun for me though. I wo 't have a set schedule but will write whenever I feel lime writing. Sometimes, that could be 3 posts a day. Other times, it might be onepost in a month.

All are free. There won't be any ads or affiliate links. I could add those much later. Buy Me A Coffee does have a link to donate though, but no one needs to.

1ityvki,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ityvki/i_met_my_younger_self_for_coffee/,I met my younger self for coffee,"She walked in wearing a blazer that didn’t quite fit.
I was in gym clothes, sweaty, possibly smelling a little gross.

She ordered a Vietnamese latte and an egg pie,
I ordered matcha because I have changed in ways that might surprise her,
but not in the ways that matter most.

“Wow, you look like you’ve been working out.”
“I do,” I said. “Twice a day sometimes.”

She smiled— not the authentic kind, but the kind you put on when you’re trying to look okay.
Then she glanced at my left hand.

I could hear her heart breaking.
She turned away, trying not to let me see.
(Spoiler: I saw.)

“So you finally left.”
“Yes,” I said. “But we have a son.”

That caught her attention. Her eyes flickered back to life, like a burnt-out star suddenly remembering how to shine.

“What is he like? What’s his name?”
“Atlas,” I said. “And he’s beautiful.”

“Who does he look like?”
“Most people say me. Which is to say, you.”

She nodded, and for the first time, she looked a little relieved. Like maybe, just maybe, all of this heartbreak had a purpose.

“Are you still working three jobs?” she asked.
I laughed. “No. You stopped that when you got pregnant. Now you own a business and you’re in grad school. You even take naps sometimes.”

I could see the wheels turning in her head—
the math of it all, the probability of this future being real.

We sipped our lattes in silence.

She was skinnier than me.
Not in a good way.
I remembered how it felt to live inside her body,
how it ached with the weight of everything he put her through. 

“My heart still breaks every day for everything you had to endure.”

She stared at the table, tracing circles on the wood.
“Does it get better? Any easier?”

I sighed, considering how much truth she could handle.
“Not at first,” I said. “The hardest part is still ahead of you. You will think it will break you. You will want to end the pain.
But you won’t.
You will keep going.
And one day, you will wake up and realize, you were never broken, you’ve been whole all along. Then you’ll learn to love yourself in a way you never thought possible.”

She didn’t cry, but she looked like she might.
I reached for her hand, just for a second,

1ityvdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ityvdf/not_sure_on_how_to_advance/,Not sure on how to advance,"Hi everyone, I need advice from bystanders on how to advance in my situation with this specific girl I been dating. M(24) dating F(22) for almost two months now, we have been on 8 dates so far, including 1 sleepover which ended up in us sleeping together. To sort of summarize everything in short before I dig into specifically what I'm looking for with this. We started talking to one another just prior of Christmas and since both of us were away at that time we didn't meet until 2th of January for a quick coffee that ended up with us going on a drinking date approximately 2 days later. 

I'd like to say everything started around our second date, where the normal question comes up with what we are both looking for in dating and she proceeded with saying that she was unsure with what she wanted in all of this and wanted to take things slow to see how stuff advance but that she was still fine with relationship if it comes to that but considering she stated that she was young and is still studying she didn't want to lock down to something because in approximately 1.5 years, whenever shes done with her studies she wants to move out of the states and work abroad. I was like mhm okay said I was okay with that and said I was looking for something a little bit more serious as relationship but still unsure whether I'm ready to commit to one but said I'm specifically not looking for some sort of casual/situationship because I cba with that as I have a full time job and maybe want something more than that.

Stuff slowly started to advance throughout the date which ended up with us making out, holding hands in the city etc, this carried on for a couple of dates ranging from long walks by the beach with her dog to cinema dates. On our 5th date we went for our second ""long"" walk with her puppy, holding hands, making out at random spots staring out over the ocean. Fast forward towards the end of the date she brought up the ""what-are-we"" discussion but prior of this she started saying that she feels like we are two different people with two different goals in life because it feels like I want to settle down in the city while she wants to move abroad and do her things in like 2+ years down the line. Prior of this I said had decided to remove my dating profiles because I liked how this was going but she said what she said I was pretty bummed out by this comment so I sorta lost my energy while we were discussion things so we parted ways in the end and she shooting me a text a couple of hours later saying ""I hope you got home safe and that I had a nice walk home to think over things"" reason for that was because I said I didn't feel like her driving me home because I wanted to think these things over on my way home because she said that I can pick on how I wanted to proceed with this.

We spoke a little bit the day after and came to the conclusion that we try to meet one more time as normal like we previously have to see how it feels, if it feels wrong then ends stuff here and there. The next date that was planned 1.5 weeks later were a dinner at my house, so we went to the store picked up the necessary stuff and cooked it together over a bottle of wine or two. This thing lead to another and she ended up staying over which resulted in us sleeping together, her original plan stated in the text the week prior of that was to just come over do the dinner and leave or do anything thing that would ""lead-me-on"" She ended up staying to after lunch the morning after before I drove her home, kissed her goodbye etc, after this I had to leave for a ski vacation with my family pushing into this week, on friday the 14th I asked if she wanted to be my valentine because she have been very affectionate that whole week I was gone so I decided to ask her that even though I wasn't gonna be home. She said ""omg yes I want to be that"" and I said lets meet up and do something fun when I get back which is this week.

We met yesterday for a couple of drinks at some bars and we sort of open up to one another and she kinda pushed me into talking about my depressive situation because that was brought up when I was drunk the last time we met so she was interesting in getting to know more about it and why. I said some private stuff that I won't bring up here and she told me I should talk to a shrink about it and I said nah I don't want to, and she was like ""lets go together, no one has to know"" I was pretty uncomfortable talking about this to her as this is nothing no one really knows that I am this way and I ended up falling a few tears because I couldn't hold it in anymore because I was pissed about the situation as she kept pushing me to talk about it. I told her to never bring it up again because this is nothing I want to talk about in front of people especially not at a bar where people can hear and see me. 

We ended up going out to some indian place and had a some food before we left the city together and parted ways, note that we were pretty much alone in this restaurant so we hid in a booth and made out all the time which is nothing she does in public apparently.

Today she had left for her own vacation over the weekend and my friend sent me a screenshot of her still being ""online"" on the dating app that we had met on but had said to me that she only have the app on her phone but doesn't really use it talk to anyone like she talks to me.

I'm pretty confused on how to even approach this situation because when shes with me it feels like she wants a relationship considering the way she acts and always wants to hold me hand, fidgets with my shirt when sitting next to me and so on. She said to me recently that she wasn't still sure with what she wanted and needed to see me more to know and see me more to make that decision. But like she have already told all her friends about me and sent pictures off me to them because they wanted to seem me but have also told her siblings and mom about me. 

That is what makes me confused, she goes over and beyond when shes with me but she still doesn't know if she even wants to commit to me after going on all these ALOT more than just platonic stuff with me that she even suggests herself, she suggested that we should go out for dinner again whenever shes back home but also for me to go home to see her new apartment for a movie night and cook dinner together these things were suggested by her on valentine after I asked her which she said yes to.

She says she doesn't want me to go around hoping that we will end up in a relationship because she doesn't know that herself if she even wants one but still wants to do all of these things that are ALOT more than just casual friendship, because I have already told her the time we had the convo that if she wants to be friends it's better that we end things because I don't have to energy to do all of that waste of time stuff. 

**What is your guys suggestions on this?**   
Because of this whole confusion shit I have lined up a date with another girl tomorrow because I don't even know how I feel about this other person anymore because shes not able to commit nor know what she wants after talking to one another for 2 months and been on 8 dates with total of 40 hours spent  together",1,1740059323.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

So basically I'm ignored and not spoken to for the most part while he's enjoying his magical time. Whatever dude. But I noticed something. 

For years, YEARS his wake up routine has always been weird.  Like little to no speaking. Makes his own breakfast.  I'm on my own. Took me a long time to convince him to make coffee for both of us.  Weird cold morning routine. So weird for me. We could have crazy wild sex the night before, but in the morning, hardly any speaking, don't even look at me. Now I'm not a big chatterbox in the morning but this is too much. 

Anyway fast forward to this visit. Lots of other people in the house including his favorite cousins. He has no problem being a chatty carthy with them.

1ityswc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kafka/comments/1ityswc/joe_k_part_3/,Joe K - Part 3,"The case remained open but, for now, K was free to go. The only stipulations were for him to stay in the country, maintain regular contact with his lawyer and return to the police station, if and when required, for further evaluation. In need of clarity, he decided to walk home but, no matter how hard he tried, the days events stubbornly refused to make any more sense than the weather, which couldn't make its mind up any more than he could. Was he unsettled by this disruption into his simple, routine life? Was he angry at the authorities for subjecting him to this small miscarriage of justice? Was he morally outraged at the insinuation that he was guilty of something? *Was* he guilty of something? Something he had no conscious awareness of, or didn't realise the full implications of? Did he actually have something to hide? Was *he* hiding from something? Was he depressed by the chief inspector's assertion that he was a ""virtual nonentity"", and the implication that he wasn't quite human enough to count? *Was* he human enough to count? Wasn't he getting a little paranoid, here? Were those CCTV cameras following his movements as he made his way home? Were the curtains twitching in the windows of some of the other flats in Malevich Square, as he quickly walked towards the doorway of North Block? He quickly checked his mailbox and ran up to his fourth-floor flat, three steps at a time, before any of the other residents could *accidentally* bump into him and bombard him with questions he had no answers to, his ignorance almost certainly being misread as evasion.

The relief he felt at the successful completion of this task disappeared as soon as the sight inside hit his eyes, causing them to weep for the first time in as long as he could remember, not for the mess left by this morning's chaotic intrusion but for the tidiness left by the absence of his beloved books. The paper soul of his home had been ripped out. In its place was a solitary, soulless piece of white card informing him of the *Temporary Requisition Order* and a phone number to call for further information.

Although the appetite he'd recruited on the march home had suddenly gone AWOL, he forced himself to make a cheese salad sandwich and was still contemplating the first bite when there was a knock at the door. He opened it to a breath of fresh air carrying the sweet sound of the Welsh Valleys. ""Hey Joe... oh, babes, have you been crying?"" Two slender arms wrapped around him and hugged his wiry frame to her bra-less bosom. It was his neighbour, Katie, and, although he'd been the recipient of this spontaneous gesture many times before, now, instead of making him feel slightly uneasy, he was more grateful for the physical contact of another human being than he'd been in years. Her dark brown curls emitted a fragrance of springtime cherry blossom, and the soft, subtle curves of her body in a Sonic Youth t-shirt and black leggings felt like the physical manifestation of a mid-sixties John Coltrane solo. He had to end it before he completely lost himself in the tenderness of the moment but, when faced with the little sapphire stud in her cute button nose and the magic in her pale blue eyes, he had to take further evasive action. Black magic, he told myself, wicked sorcery beyond her command, sent by the demons of hell to draw me into a world of pain - quick, break the spell. He had to say something neutral to control his emotions and establish an air of formality.

""I'm not sure I can babysit tonight, I'm exhausted. Something terrible has happened - I've been arrested.""

""I know that, silly, I was just getting to sleep when the bastards woke me up. And don't worry about Robbie, he's staying at his grandpa's this weekend, I just wanted to make sure you're alright. Bloody hell, look at this place, did they find what they were looking for? what even were they looking for?""

""Nothing! I haven't done anything wrong, I swear. Please tell me you believe me, no one else does, not even my lawyer, and he's legally obliged to.""

""I didn't know you had a lawyer.""

""Neither did I... Well?""

""Well what?""

""Do you believe me?""

""Of course I believe you,"" she said, and gave him another hug that might have only convinced him because he needed to be convinced. ""Of course, I do get paid to believe everything men tell me so if it's reassurance you're after you might want to ask someone else... I'm joking - come on let's put the kettle on."" It was only when she looked over the lounge from the kitchen that Katie noticed the main difference in K's flat. ""Where's your books, babes?""

""They took them.""

""What, all of them? in a truck? when? was I asleep? why would they do that? when are you getting them back?...""

""Wait, let me catch up... yes... probably... when I was in custody... I guess so... fuck knows... and soon, I hope, I've got nothing to read.""

""Nothing at all? no wonder you're so upset - you need books like I need cigarettes. Well, you can have *Gravity's Rainbow* back if you want, you might've beat me with that one, babes - people think I read difficult novels but what the fuck is going on there? I barely knew what was happening from one sentence to the next... or even within one sentence, to be honest. I was gonna grab another Lispector off you, as it goes, but... I just can't believe it, are you sure you're OK? I know how stressful it can be, I spent five hours in a holding cell once, and all for a quarter of weed - I guess it must've been a slow day. Speaking of which, if you need anything to calm you down, I've still got a bit of that Lemon Kush left from our last film night. Just don't watch *Sin-a-ducky, New York* again - bloody hell, that was one of the most heart-breaking films I've ever seen. They could at least have put a warning at the start - 'This film contains scenes of extreme veracity, do not consume with banging weed'..."" Katie could go on like this forever and K would happily absorb that rapid overflowing river of information, delivered, as it was, by a clear, gentle stream of a voice that floated him far above his usual loquacity tolerance level. On this occasion, he even managed to uphold his end of the conversation. She insisted on hearing every detail about his arrest, which included a brief digression into the *Blackadder* series' - how could she not have seen it? - that failed do it any justice. They shared his cheese salad sandwich, drank their coffees, and he could finally dismiss his worst fears of mental collapse when the cathartic process culminated in a shared belief in the sheer absurdity of the whole wretched business. ""It's more confusing than that crazy rocket book and more random than Slothrop walking around post-war Europe bumping into everyone he knows... bloody hell, I gotta get ready for work.""

Getting ready for work meant putting on her 'Katerina Ivanovna' costume and approximating a Ukrainian accent. She trusted him enough to reveal her occupation a few weeks before she trusted him enough to to ask him to babysit for her son, but he hadn't brought it up since then, fearful of saying the wrong thing and offending her. Feeling that their relationship had reached a new level of intimacy, in spite of his best efforts to resist it, he decided to go with the flow and take more of an interest in her life. ""Do you like being a...""

""Stripper? Yeah, most of the time. It's a lot better than waitressing or stacking shelves or... cleaning... no offence. At least I'm working for myself. The club takes a cut, obviously, but Supervixens are one of the best according to the girls who travel around a lot. They're female-owned and female-run, and the only men who work there are on security - and that's only 'cause guys are less likely to start any nonsense if they see a big man on the door. The best thing is getting to play a role, I always wanted to be an actress.""

""Is it easier when you're playing a role?""

""It's easier to make money. Katya's a lot sexier than me. Also, the clients start imagining your poor, struggling family back home - all those crippled veterans and widowed sisters and starving orphans and old, arthritic grandmothers picking potatoes in a Crimean wasteland. It allows them to convince themselves that buying a private dance is an act of charity, like a stripped down version of the philanthropic delusion.""

""You make it sound like *you're* exploiting *them*?""

""Maybe we're exploiting each other, would that make you feel more comfortable? Or maybe we're both being exploited by our pre-historic genetic programming - you know, the one that makes women attracted to wealth and power and men attracted to youth and beauty. Or maybe we're both exploiting that programming for shits and giggles, but let's be clear about this, Don Quixote, I don't need any knight in shining armour to protect me from the evil patriarchy. I'm a big girl and I can look after myself.""

""I'm sorry,"" said K. ""I didn't mean... I watched a documentary the other night - only because I was curious about what you do, and...""

""Let me guess? - a bunch of neo-fascist pseudo-feminists telling men how to think and women how to behave? These days, you're oppressed if you wear a bikini and oppressed if you wear a hijab, oppressed if you show your tits and oppressed if you cover your hair. Speaking of which, I'll have to cover mine up if I don't hurry up and get in that shower. If you're curious about my job, babes, just ask me. Or come for a drink down the club one night, the girls won't hassle you if they know you're with me... unless you want them to, of course."" Before she left, she gave him another hug, but he was back to feeling uneasy, and, this time, he wasn't the only one. Well done, thought K, after he closed the door behind her, you managed to piss off the only friend you've got left... even without trying to kiss her.

During a thorough tidying up of his flat, K forgot what an idiot he was and remembered what idiots the police were. Then he forgot that and remembered he had nothing to read. Then he forgot why he didn't watched much television, began flicking through its endlessly repetitive channels, and remembered why he didn't watch much television. Still, it didn't feel right to go to bed without a book to read so he fell asleep on the couch, watching an old episode of *Doctor Who* with Tom Baker and the cybermen.

He awoke to the sound of celebrities having breakfast and pretending to like each other, turned off the TV, had his own breakfast and pretended to like himself. Then he turned on the radio and lay on the bed, debating whether to have a shower and get changed, but the music was very relaxing and the presenter reminded him of Katie so he stayed there for a couple of hours. Despite his best efforts, though, the anxieties of the previous day refused to budge, so he went for a long walk. What made him smile was his battered old copy of *Gravity's Rainbow* on the mat outside his door. What made him grimace was the dog shit he stepped in when he got to Bosch Gardens. He took it personally and became angry and uncharacteristically judgemental, wondering which dog's human was responsible. Was it the border collie playing ball? Was it the nervous chorkie barking at everything? Was it the rickety old greyhound whose rickety old human was tearing up a scratch-card and throwing it on the floor in a ritual sacrifice to the god of money? Was it the friendly labradoodle puppy wagging its tail? Was it the cocker-spaniel chasing squirrels? Was it the slobbering bulldog? It was probably the bulldog - he looked a bit shifty and so did his human, glancing up from his mobile phone and pretending not to see K, as if caught red-handed. Of course, he might have just been embarrassed at receiving an explicit picture, or guilty for sending one. Why do some men do that? he thought. No woman actually *wants* to see a picture of a penis, even their husband's, or a particularly impressive one, when they look at their phone, do they? At best, the probability of success must be far enough below the potential to offend to make the risk mathematically untenable. For his own peace of mind, and only in his mind, K formally accused the bulldog, closed the case of the copropodal canine and took himself for a walk around the park, before telling himself he'd been a good boy and deserved a treat - a chicken jalfrezi from the Indian takeaway on Kandinsky Street. They were closed, so he settled for chicken tikka pasty from the Conshop and immediately regretted it. When he got home, there was a message from Clean Knows on his answering machine informing him of a change of location for tomorrow's job.",1,1740059117.0,Kafka,0,1.0,False

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) combined with sharding will transform the network after an extended period of expectation. The upcoming Ethereum network will address its scalability problems through its ability to handle 100,000 transactions per second.

The Ethereum project motivates users to maintain their ETH tokens as part of its new Proof-of-Stake (PoS) staking economy. The security mechanism improves network protection while decreasing ETH availability, leading to increased value potential.

During 2025, Ethereum will  achieve dominance in the blockchain market by implementing cross-chain compatibility features through Arbitrum Nitro projects. Ethereum 2.0 serves as a revolutionary platform that boosts blockchain technology standards through its recent developments.

Ethereum's capabilities are continuously expanding through Arbitrum and Optimistic Rollups projects, which strengthen its position against centralized systems. To demonstrate the wider utility of decentralized technology, NCOG Earth Chain is also investigating how blockchain can speed up identification verification procedures.

The transition to Point-of-Sale technology has achieved more than a 99% energy reduction alongside enhanced security due to its distributed operating system. Ethereum continues to develop toward becoming more than just a survivor in the digital changes it faces.

Sorry for talking before having my morning coffee, you're all great people at the end of the day.  


So, to preface this DEI post, I'd like to start with mentioning that I'm indigenous. This means I'm subject to DEI in Canada anytime I go to look for a job/career. I hate it with a passion.   
""Oh you're indigenous? HIRED! Now our company looks great!"" Sike.  


Canada has a terrible way of ""including"" nish people into their work environments. I get inclusive offers all the time for company positions, because they ""need"" a native face due to DEI. Funny  part is i've worked in these positions. You're lying to yourself if you think the company truly cares whether you have a different color of skin or dress up like a dog on your own time. They don't care cause thats not a companies focus. Therefore, DEi is pretty much useless and I hate that I can get hired based off that ALONE.  


Are you beginning to understand how obnoxious and annoying that is to see? Thats what DEi is. I know this will irk some people but I absolutely hate that companies do this and have been hired on that fact, then have put minimal effort into my job at those companies compared to the company I work for now which hired me because of my work ethic and MERIT.  


Do you see why hiring because the company needs to fill the space of a person of color over focusing on their work ethic first? I bust my ass off, I have two degrees, one in business/enviro and one in computer security. I WORK HARD REGARDLESS OF MY STATURE.  


So as a neutral stance, DEI has potential, but it's missing one letter that puts it altogether, and that's M for MERIT. otherwise known as work ethic. You're human, what happens when you stop working on yourself?

  
So long as you put in the work or MERIT, then the other 3 letters don't matter.  
The problem business faces when trying to mix the two, like mixing oil and water, is that DEI politics, and business don't mix. they never did and never will, because work is based on MERIT and not a persons looks or where they came from. IF work ethic/MERIT comes first, the rest will be respected.



Furthermore, if you want a business to be profitable, do you spend millions making sure its a ""safe"" environment, which it likely already was, or do you spend what you need on workers who are capable of taking care of their self while also doing their best at the job they've been given or want to work towards with the main goal in mind.  


tl;dr, doesn't matter who you are, what you look like, where you came from, or your political stance. Its the work ethic, effort or MERIT (the one letter/word originally missing from DEI) you put in to yourself, the WORK you do to get where you want to go.   
  
I get that feelings are involved; however a business entity has a main goal of driving profit. It becomes increasingly difficult if you have to hire people because its necessary to show inclusivity meanwhile that person isn't going to work nearly as hard as the person who needs the job regardless of inclusivity. I would know, i've been there and have done exactly the above. The company I work for now hired me based off my MERIT and I bust my ass off for these guys and they give me the respect I deserve for the effort I put into myself to get to where I am today.",0,1740058681.0,Superstonk,16,0.35,False

I've been on 12.5 for a couple of months now. I am nervous to go up to 15 because the side effects are manageable now but I'm afraid they will be too much if I go up. 



Anyways, lately I feel so tired. Overall I feel way better compared to 100 pounds ago, but I am always tired and just want to nap especially the first 48 hours after the injection. Every morning I have a protein shake and coffee for breakfast along with a multivitamin. Early in the week (I usually take my shot Sun morning) I don't eat lunch as I am just not hungry. As the week goes on, I will eat lunch if I am hungry. I am not sure food has anything to do with it because if I do eat more later in the week I still feel the same way. 

  
Any ideas what I can do to just have more energy? Is there a certain supplement I can take in addition to the multivitamin? I want to start working out, but my fear is that I will be more exhausted then I currently am. I am a service tech and do a lot of moving and climbing ladders so I don't think I could handle being more exhausted then I already am.

1ityl09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/1ityl09/i_heard_someones_conversation_with_bluetooth/,I heard someone’s conversation with Bluetooth earphones.,"I was out camping with friends, not too far from a road with a gas station. I needed to pee, and fancied a real indoor toilet as opposed to having to somehow hide from my friends somewhere in our flat field. I grab my earphones and a jacket and use Google maps to go to the gas station. On the way there, I listen to music with my earphones. For the sake of brevity, I arrive at the gas station, pause my music and remove my earphones and enter the bathroom. I do my business and start to leave. 

On my way out of the bathroom, I put my earphones back in, and instead of music I heard a woman’s voice. I figured a YouTube video had started randomly playing as my phone does that sometimes. But no, YouTube isn’t open and my Spotify is paused. I stop and listen to her voice for a moment. She said something like 

👱🏼‍♀️: *I’m just worried about her. She isn’t answering her calls. She won’t answer her phone* 

Then I hear a man reply and say

🧔🏻‍♂️: *Shes just having fun with her friends. I promise she’s alright, okay?*

It occurred to me that my earphones might’ve somehow tuned into a radio station or something, but that made little sense and the dialogue didn’t match. I continue listening as I leave the bathroom, and the man and woman continue to talk about this third person who I figured was their daughter. I buy some snacks and leave the store, still listening. Then, I see a car parked up in front of the gas station store, with a man and a woman. Their mouth movements matched the dialogue. This sounds awful but when I realised this I went back to the store and sat at a table where I could see them through a window and just listened in awe and confusion.

Through eavesdropping, I learned their daughter had gone to a sleepover at a friend’s house. She was a young woman (21), yet older than me, and she’d never stopped overnight at a person’s house apparently, so her mom was worried about the potential dangers. I listen for five more minutes, when the woman says something that seriously made my heart skip a beat. She said something similar to

👱🏼‍♀️: *that boy in the window has coffee. you should get some. I will.*

They both looked at me and I almost had to go to the toilet again. It was like being caught. Eventually they just carried on talking to each other as I sat there panting. They drifted around talking about other things too, and I sat there for about ten more minutes before the ‘transmission’ just stoped completely. I could see through the store window that their mouths were still moving but I could no longer hear them. All through listening to them I was in complete awe, and when it ceased I just left the store and walked back to the camp, trying to figure it out. I decided not to tell my friends. This was a week ago and I still have no idea.

We drink a lot of coffee so a Kilo would be ideal. I am intrigued and terrified at the same time. I fully admit after years on a Behmor I still do not fully understand the science of roasting, curves, etc due to lack of bean probe and reliable temp readings on my roaster. I am excited about being able to run artisan and nerd out with data, but scared as well. 

All of that to ask - I have a really good used deal lined up on a 1 year old Kaleido M10 Pro roaster, but there is also a Aillio Bullet R1v2 for sale. Both are similar age, low use, but the sniper is 3 hours closer to me. I know I need to choose fast since these usually sell quick when posted.  The M10 is $800 cheaper than the Bullet. 

I am trying to research quickly, but can anyone provide input on which might be better? The M10 seller claims they compared both and the Sniper is better at auto roasting. My fear is having a roaster that is 100% dependent on a compute with no other display screen. I also feel like the Bullet might have better resell if I decide large scale roasting is not for me - but saving $800 by buying the Sniper sure buys a lot of green beans..

I have autism and adhd and I know I’m VERY full on.

Then a ‘friend’  i know in real life won’t ever come for coffee with me. She makes excuses and never texts me back. I just can’t seem to let go because I loved how close we used to be. 

Another ‘friend’ said she’d catch up with me but hasn’t, and I was the last to message her and she just didn’t reply. 

I have a few online friends and even they ditch me. 

I’m a nice person and really don’t understand it. 

But now I’m wondering if I just stop messaging, stop being the one to always suggest things, will they forget me? It’s been three days since I stopped being the instigator and now it’s crickets, I hear nothing.

to consume: 

* dates
* prunes
* prune juice
*  hot coffee
*  olive oil
* castor oil
*  warm water (quickly)
* GREEK yogurt, not Greek-style
* Kefir (might be even better than yogurt since it has more probiotics)
* Kimchi (again, probiotics)

supplements: 

* fiber supplements 
* probiotic supplements
* Glycerin 

Physical:

* Rubbing ointment on stomach
* foot stool (when pooping)
*  squatting 
*  laying on your stomach and rolling
*  applying heat (from hot water bottles) onto the stomach (actually helps a lot if you do this for the entire night when sleeping)
* Singing bowls (works best if coupled with heat on stomach, e.g. lay flat on the bed, put a hot water bottle on your stomach and then put a singing bowl on top, then just gently hit it to get the vibrations throughout your body)
*  rubbing lubricant (e.g. olive oil, vaseline) onto your butt
* Enema (Water, or if you're REALLY constipated (i.e. impacted) you could add some olive oil inside 
* [ Moo method](https://youtu.be/QDk93cvZAuk?si=Vz73UIoelQeVU0ut)
* [Jin Shin Jyutsu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHLbU1DwEII&t=330s)



Last resort: digging it out with fingers (disgusting but really works, especially when you're impacted)



Daily habits:

* Drink A LOT of water
* fruits and vegetables (yeah everyone knows this, if you find it hard to eat a lot you can take fiber supplements)
* try to poo at the same time everyday 
* get enough exercise!!!! if not, just walking more would help!!!",3,1740057865.0,Constipation,3,1.0,False

I don’t know who else to ask other than the online community. I used to have tummy cramps and also a pain under the lower ribs radiating to the back 5 years ago. And now I’m facing the same thing but worst. The doctors didn’t find anything concerning from the colonoscopy and endoscopy other than 1-2 diverticulitis. 

Fast forward to recently, I had a very bad pain on my tummy and back after drinking milk and eating eggs, had fever and tummy was aching like I did 200 sit-ups within 30mins. Since then, my bowel movements are very weird, I have constipation and loose stools like the photos attached. My tummy cramps are becoming abit common, like twice a week at most, it mostly happened 2-4hrs after eating. Not sure what triggers it.

My diet has been affected too. I don’t know what triggers it as it happens on random. I thought it was milk and I tried drinking on some random days, I’m fine. Same goes for gluten food and coffee. I’m now living on a soup based diet and sometimes I’m having a flare from just…..chicken soup :(

I lost weight but I think mostly from eating less. 

Just wanna hear from the community if anyone have the same bowel or the same experience like me? And maybe give me tips on how I can ease the pain on a natural way or something I need to avoid.

Hey everyone,

I female 26 - I’ve been feeling pretty left out at work, and I could really use some advice. I work in a team made up entirely of women, and while I try my best to be friendly and helpful, I often feel like I don’t fully belong. I work hard, support my coworkers whenever I can, and try to engage in conversations. Sure, I can be a little awkward at times, but my jokes are lighthearted and never mean-spirited.

Despite that, I’ve noticed that whenever my coworkers are chatting, I either get ignored or talked over when I try to join in. When they go out for lunch or coffee, they invite everyone else but somehow always seem to forget to invite me. I’m not expecting deep friendships, but being left out in a workspace where I collaborate closely with them feels disheartening.

I don’t want to make a big deal out of it, but it’s starting to wear on me. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you handle feeling like an outsider at work? Any advice would be really appreciated.

But I’ve also realised since being on my meds I have not felt a natural daytime tired/ need to nap at all, in particular on days where I have not gotten enough sleep. These periods of wakefulness are extremely helpful of course, but I’m worried that maybe I should not be experiencing them. 

For example before my medication if I did not get a good night sleep before school/ a lecture I would be suffering through out/ not attend. Obviously it’s good my meds bypass these factors HOWEVER it also means that I have not given my bed times a second thought for a while. For example if there’s a big event before an early lecture many / me included before my meds would be worried or stressed about having to wake up and maybe therefore miss it. 

However I’m aware that my meds and a coffee can bypass any tiredness from lack of sleep and I’ll be fine the next day. 

In hindsight I’m starting to think that this is maybe inherently extremely unhealthy and perhaps a big downside of my medication. Don’t get me wrong the benefits of my meds have been beyond life changing and great. But I am also worried that maybe other aspects of my routine have been masked and mean my reliance on my medication, if I ever were to stop them, may be a lot greater than I imagined.

Especially when you've done NOTHING to deserve it.

Do these people not realize the pain and damage they are causing? They always seem to feel justified. How can you bully half the new-hires and feel like the 'good guys'. Especially when you mentally broke someone down until they quit?? It causes me to lose faith in humanity. Especially since my last bully was a devout ""ChRiStiAn""

The bullies themselves were accepted in to the workplace, and they refuse to return the favor. They hoard information, refuse to train, and aggressively attack the reputation of their targets. Even working to isolate and ostracize them. 

At my last job, my bully was attacking my reputation on day one. She was criticizing my competence and refusing to train me. Random people who were nice to me initially suddenly acted like I murdered their dog. My bully found fault with EVERYTHING I did. She'd complain about me making coffee, glancing at my phone for one second, and even attacked me after I did her a favor.

My bully was a hypocrite who'd spend HOURS sitting on her phone, avoid work like the plague, and spend most of her day talking. The double standards are so aggravating. It's especially frustrating being nit-picked and micromanaged by someone who has NO supervisory status, and who is is brazenly lazy and careless. I don't know if bullies are just delusional, or if they want to power trip by showing it's justified when THEY are late and make countless mistakes,  but if YOU make one tiny error you will be drag through the mud.

When my bully wasn't eating or avoiding working, she was gossiping about me 24/7,  trying to humiliate me, talking down to me, sabotaging me, and even taking credit for my work.

It's just mind-blowing to me how someone can be so incredibly nasty and cruel. And seems to even enjoy it / lacks remorse for their actions. Especially since my bully was an unattractive old woman who absolutely experienced bullying herself. So I guess now she takes it out on others???

Th worst part is how other people just ignore it, enable her, and even join in. You can manage to win some coworkers over, but the bully NEVER stops. The harder you work & the nicer you are, the more they seem to HATE you. And the more desperate & determined they are to destroy you and push you out.

Like, my last bully pushed THREE separate people to quit within the span of a few months. She was a terrible employee with zero work ethic (who didn't show up, and was late frequently). Yet she was friends with the manager and spend her day sucking up to people and making small-talk, so everyone kind of viewed her as 'nice' and 'caring', and they believed her opinion about new people. But when you attack THREE different people, obviously there is a pattern. And people just choose to ignore it. I think the issue is that most people blamed the manager and his standoffish attitude, so the bully flew under the radar. And no one viewed her as the real problem.

It's just sickening how these monsters destroy people's lives, mental-health, and livelihood with seemingly zero remorse",13,1740057561.0,workplace_bullying,6,1.0,False

Hello everyone, 

I tried to drink a cup of coffee today and then I felt some effects of being alert for some time. After 25 minutes, the effects of being alert and cognitive improvement started to waver on and off. It later became diminished to a low point that I couldn't recognize it anymore. I later drank two cups of coffee and a red bull that was 16 ounces and I don't feel the hyper effects. I was feeling it after one cup of coffee this morning and I was feeling something. Then suddenly, I felt like the effects literally decreased randomly out of nowhere and it doesn't make sense because I haven't had coffee in years! I took the red bull and still feel nothing. This is tied to my situation of feeling diminished experiences out of nowhere. I feel like I literally woke up one morning and lost my sensations and my brain interprets everything differently now. It's likely the brain is failing to process the information about the world and what's happening around me. 

When I even try to wake up from sleep, I don't feel refreshed immediately. I feel like I haven't slept though.
I don't feel the full refreshment at all yet. That's not good.

I tried to take melatonin as well one time. My body was falling weaker and asleep and a bit drowsy quickly as usual but then the effects started to get more subtle immediately for some reason. It started to feel like my body was fighting against it in a strange way. That's not normal at all. Normally, this is the kind of thing that should work immediately because I am VERY SENSITIVE to drugs/stimulants. My mind was fighting to stay awake and that's weird. My brain was fighting to be conscious and that makes no sense. Seconds later, the effects become very subtle for no reason. That's not normal. That makes no damn sense and I want to be back to normal. 

This morning, I took some ALPHA-GPC and within three minutes, I immediately felt like I have a high boost of energy and mood and like I can conquer my day but then the effects IMMEDIATELY became subtle. This is NOT a tolerance for me at all. That's impossible. Tolerance is when you have done something over and over again and your body starts to get used to it so you need more of the same drug to get the same effect for a new person. What's happening to me is that I immediately feel like the effects become very subtle to my body and mind immediately, which makes no damn sense.

1ity137,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ity137,Bakit ang laki ng price premium ng PH electronics compared to other countries?,"For context, I live in Japan (around the Tokyo metro area) and work for a large non-Japanese company here, kaso in late April this year, gagamitin ko na PTO and will spend some time dyan sa Pinas. While there, I plan to upgrade from my iPhone 12 and buy the iPhone 16e since it’s almost everything I want (hindi ko maintindihan si Apple kung bakit hindi included ang MagSafe while included naman ang Qi2 wireless charging). Anyway, a major reason on why gusto ko bumili ng phone sa 🇵🇭 is due to the in-built shutter sound na maingay talaga at hindi pwede patayin in Japanese phones, regardless kung kinuha mo siya unlocked or sa carrier. Hindi pwede patayin ang camera shutter sound in JP phones since dati, madaming loko kumukuha ng upskirt shots of women. Ever since those cases, the loud shutter sound stayed for good. 

While understand ko na trivial need ang camera shutter sound na pwede patayin, I go coffee shop hopping and/or exhibits in my free time and minsan, I do like taking pictures during those occasions. Kaso, since mostly serene ang mga places napinupuntahan ko, I do find it embarrassing na yung camera shutter sound ng phone napakaingay. This lead me to just holding outa while more and to buy the phone later there in PH.

Still, when I went to the Apple PH website, nashock ako sa price of 40,000 PHP ng 16e with 128GB. Using BSP exchange rates as of this post, yung JP 128GB iPhone 16e is 38,000 PHP after conversion from the yen, so merong 2K premium yung PH equivalent niya. If compared sa States, $600 converts to 35,000 PHP - and this is Apple most likely taking into account of tariffs na ipapasa nila to US customers. Even then, halos 5K yung patong ng PH iPhone 16e compared sa US model.

When I checked sa Samsung side, mas malala 😭. Saan galing yung 53,000 PHP na regular price o 48,000 PHP *sale* price for the S24 FE? Sa dartboard ba? Meron bang free stuff na bundled with it at hindi ginagawa sa US or Japan? Kahit naka-sale na yung S24 FE for 48,000 PHP, the U.S. equivalent is $650 (38,000 PHP) while the JP model is ¥80,000 (31,000 PHP).

Is there some law or business reason kung bakit ang laki ng patong for PH-bound phones (or electronics) in general?

6. In addition to the Bund and Yu Garden, I'm knowledgeable about other attractions in Shanghai. For example, the Museum of Art Pudong is not only a place for art exhibitions but also offers another great view of the Bund. The newly opened Warm Botanical Garden in the World Expo area is world-class, featuring a fantastic combination of technology, architecture, and nature. They are all worth visiting!

About me:
1. I'm a Chinese native who loves traveling. I've visited more than 20 countries and 50 cities.
2. I've been living in Shanghai for 10 years.
3. I love exploring fun and interesting places in Shanghai.
4. I enjoy making new friends from different cultures.
5. I have extensive knowledge about Shanghai's food scene, including restaurants and snacks. Right now, it's Qing Tuan season, which is the perfect time to taste the sticky rice ball dessert. I also recommend trying popular coffee or tea drinks, such as the cheese or purple flavor options at Manner Coffee.
6. In addition to the Bund and Yu Garden, I'm knowledgeable about other attractions in Shanghai. For example, the Museum of Art Pudong is not only a place for art exhibitions but also offers another great view of the Bund. The newly opened Warm Botanical Garden in the World Expo area is world-class, featuring a fantastic combination of technology, architecture, and nature. They are all worth visiting!
7. As I have a full-time job, I am only available on weekends. 
8. Male in 30s, belong to LGBT. 

I can provide:
1. Transportation services between Pudong Airport and downtown areas on Saturdays and Sundays.
2. Personalized Shanghai itinerary planning, introducing more fun places to visit in the city.
3. Shanghai travel guidance and suggestions about hotel selection, food and restaurant recommendations, trendy store recommendations, payment options, transportation, and reservation assistance.

What I hope to gain:
1. Experience communicating with foreigners.
2. Insights into inbound travel.
3. The opportunity to introduce more fun places in Shanghai.
4. Some extra income on weekends.

I just got my final results back... and I PASSED! 🎉 Seriously, you guys have no idea how much this means to me. The past few months have been brutal. Sleepless nights fueled by coffee and textbooks, stress levels through the roof, it felt like finals would never end. I was so worried I'd mess everything up. And honestly? Mobile Legends was a huge part of how I survived. I know it sounds crazy, but those quick matches, those intense team fights, even just messing around in practice mode – it was the perfect escape. When my brain was fried from studying, a couple of games helped me unwind, clear my head, and come back to the books feeling refreshed. It was like a mini-vacation in the middle of all the chaos. I know some people might say gaming is a distraction, but for me, it was the opposite. It helped me manage my stress, gave me something to look forward to, and honestly, probably stopped me from completely losing it. Plus, the tense matchups involved in MLBB actually helped me think more clearly when I went back to studying,(Okay, maybe that's a bit of a stretch, but it felt like it) So, thank you. Thank you to this community for being a place where I could relax, have some fun, and forget about the pressure for a while. Thank you to the teammates I’ve played with, the opponents I’ve faced, the dark system and even the salty players who made me laugh (eventually). You guys helped me more than you know. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to celebrate with a few (okay, maybe more than a few) ranked matches. And good luck to anyone else still grinding through exams or anything else life throws at you. Remember, even a quick game can make a world of difference. ❤️

I launched [Klikt.io](https://Klikt.io) a little tool where event guests scan a QR code, snap photos, share it in an album and see them pop up live on a slideshow. No apps, no hassle, just instant vibes for weddings, parties... Started it to sharpen my NextJS skills and maybe fund my coffee habit.   
  
Then Apple drops *Apple Invites*. Not a carbon copy, but close enough to make me go, “Wait, Tim not now !” Now I’m stuck wondering: threat, fluke, or golden ticket?  

Here’s my brain dump: 

* **Validation**: Apple sniffing around this space might mean I’m onto something real.  
* **Edge**: While Apple’s got polish, Klikt is cross-platform, dead simple, and works on any device without breaking a sweat.  
* **Opportunity**: Could their hype actually shine a light on my niche instead of stealing it ? 

Not here to shill (but if you’re curious, it’s [klikt.io](https://klikt.io) – no pressure). I’m here for your wisdom: 

* Ever had a tech giant stomp into your lane? How’d you handle it?  
* Got any slick moves to flip a “threat” into a win?  
* Am I delusional to think Apple’s buzz could lift me up too? 

For fun: I’ve got a small crew of early users (mostly local) and a quirky affiliate program that’s been a blast to test. Now I’m at a fork – double down or rethink?

1itxv3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1itxv3z/cold_brew_business/,Cold Brew Business,"Backstory: I have approximately 8+ years of coffee/barista experience. I started a roasting coffee in 2016 for a local coffee shop, worked on coffee farms, and saved enough to buy my own small roaster by 2018. I started a small business supplying a few local shops/selling retail/selling at markets and events. When 2020 hit I just couldn’t make it. 

Fast forward to now, I still want to pursue coffee, and it’s been the only constant dream I’ve had for myself, but looking to scale back and start very small. Hopefully this would give me the chance to start with lower overhead and offer a way to build up to opening a brick and mortar in the future. I have been considering the idea of going the cold brew route. I know it’s been done a lot, but offers selling a bottled product without the cost of espresso set up. 

Does anyone have experience selling cold brew at markets, events, gaining cold brew retail clients, etc? Is it overdone or is their room for more on the market? Would you recommend selling nitro over regular cold brew? Or both? Have you found this a profitable avenue as a roaster? I would still plan on offering drip, as well as roasted 12oz bags of my coffee beans.  

Looking for any relevant advice and hearing all input on the topic. Thank you in advance!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ladies and gentlemen, tennis fans, and those who just love a good underdog story, gather 'round for the WTA Dubai Championships showdown between Karolina Muchova and Sorana Cirstea. It's like David versus Goliath, if David had a tennis racket and Goliath was really good at backhand volleys.

Karolina Muchova, the favorite, is priced at a modest 1.24 across most sportsbooks. She's the kind of player who makes you think, ""Wow, I should have practiced more as a kid."" Meanwhile, Sorana Cirstea, the underdog, is sitting pretty at odds ranging from 3.8 to 4.6. Those odds are tempting enough to make you consider a small wager, or at least a large coffee.

Now, let's talk strategy. Muchova has been playing like she's got a personal vendetta against tennis balls, while Cirstea is hoping to channel her inner Rocky Balboa. The spread is set at -4.5 to -5.0 in favor of Muchova, and the total games are hovering around 20.0 to 20.5. It's like the oddsmakers are daring you to bet on something other than the obvious.

But here's the kicker: in tennis, underdogs win about as often as your cat listens to you. So, while Cirstea's odds are tantalizing, Muchova is the safer bet. However, if you're feeling adventurous and have a penchant for living on the edge, a small wager on Cirstea could make you look like a genius—or at least give you a good story to tell.

For my best bet, I'd recommend taking the Over on total games at 20.0 or 20.5. Both players have the potential to push each other, and hey, who doesn't love a good three-set thriller? So, grab your popcorn, place your bets, and may the best racket-wielder win!",1,1740055682.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Hello, fellow warriors, I am the Porta John Sommelier, and for years, I've been working on a coffee table book with my brother. It’s time to wrap it up, but we haven’t spent enough time in the field to fill it on our own. That’s where you come in. I’m looking for photos of Porta John graffiti. All of it. No matter how messy or offensive the content might be.

Porta John art is a perfect reflection of the military—just like us, it’s a beautiful mess. Some of it’s foul, vile ramblings that sometimes slip into unhinged rants. Other times, it’s crude drawings of dicks or Mia Khalifa's boobs. But sometimes, it’s surprisingly thoughtful, hilarious, and downright profound. You’ll find political commentary, jabs at leadership, shots at each other, and self-deprecating humor.

I’ve seen everything in those cramped, sun-baked boxes—poetry on love and loss, well-researched pieces like “Is 1SG a cuck?” and “Why does Jody bang my girl?” I’ve even witnessed beautiful drawings of flowers, fancy bears, and—well, more dicks and Mia Khalifa’s boobs. Anyone can write for a paper or sketch for a comic, but only true warriors—real poets laureate—can create such masterpieces from the comfort of a sweltering 124° Porta John in Kandahar or a frozen -25° shit shack in Watertown.

So here’s the ask: Snap a pic of that Porta John art and send it to portajohnportraits@gmail.com. Include as much or as little information as you want. At least tell me the location. And if you want to include your name, unit, or thoughts in the caption, just drop them in quotation marks in the email.

I need at least 500 more photos to make this book happen. So, send those photos, and I’ll take four French Toast Tornados, two Aussie Monsters, and a Zoloft to go, please ( the order is required on some Army Specific reddits)  ",0,1740055051.0,Military,0,0.17,False

1itxgyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1itxgyb/is_laughland_teeth_whitening_worth_it_i_tried_it/,Is Laughland Teeth Whitening Worth It? I Tried It for a Week – Here’s My Experience,"I’ve always been skeptical about teeth whitening kits. There are so many on the market, all promising a bright smile in days, but do they really work? I drink coffee daily, and over the years, my teeth started looking dull and stained. I wanted to find something that worked but wasn’t as expensive as a professional whitening treatment.

After some research, I came across **Laughland teeth whitening**. What caught my attention was that it uses a **dentist-formulated gel** and an **LED light**, which supposedly enhances the whitening process. It sounded more advanced than whitening strips or toothpaste, so I figured I’d give it a try.

Here’s my experience after using it for six days.

# What’s in the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

When the kit arrived, I was glad to see that it was **simple and straightforward**. No unnecessary extra steps—just what you need to get started:

* **Whitening Gel Pens** – Easy to apply and not messy.
* **LED Mouthpiece** – Helps activate the gel for faster, deeper whitening.
* **Clear Instructions** – Simple steps that anyone can follow.

I liked that the packaging felt high-quality and that the process didn’t seem complicated.

# How to Use Laughland Teeth Whitening

Each whitening session takes only **10 minutes**, which made it easy to fit into my day. Here’s what I did:

1. **Brush & Dry Your Teeth** – This helps the gel stick better.
2. **Apply the Gel** – The pen applicator makes it easy to coat each tooth evenly.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece** – Turn it on and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse & Clean** – After the timer is up, rinse your mouth and clean the device.

The process was easy and didn’t feel like a hassle, which I appreciated.

# My Results After 6 Days

* **Day 1:** No major difference, but my teeth felt extra clean.
* **Day 3:** The yellowish tint was starting to fade, especially on the edges of my teeth.
* **Day 6:** My teeth looked **6-7 shades whiter**, and the results were **even and natural**—not fake or overly bright.

I was expecting at least some sensitivity, but surprisingly, **I didn’t feel any discomfort at all**, even after drinking cold water.

# What Makes Laughland Different?

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel** – Designed to remove stains without damaging enamel.
2. **LED Light Activation** – Helps the gel penetrate deeper for better results.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients** – The gel is stored properly, so it stays effective, unlike some drugstore products that lose potency over time.

# How Does It Compare to Other Whitening Products?

* **Whitening Strips** – Work, but they’re uneven and often cause sensitivity.
* **Whitening Toothpaste** – Good for maintaining whiteness but doesn’t remove deeper stains.
* **Professional Whitening** – Very effective but expensive and can leave teeth feeling sore.

Laughland felt like the **best balance**—affordable, effective, and no pain.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

1. **Does it damage enamel?** – No, the formula is designed to be gentle but effective.
2. **Does it work on deep stains?** – Yes, it helped reduce older coffee stains.
3. **How long do results last?** – Avoiding staining foods and keeping up with oral hygiene helps results last for months.

# Tips for the Best Results

* **Be Consistent** – Use it for all six days in a row.
* **Avoid Staining Foods** – Coffee, tea, and wine can slow down results.
* **Brush & Floss Daily** – Helps maintain your bright smile.

# Final Thoughts – Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening** delivered what it promised. It was easy to use, fit into my routine, and most importantly, **worked without causing pain or sensitivity**. My teeth looked **brighter but still natural**, and I didn’t have to deal with irritation.

If you’re looking for an at-home teeth whitening option that actually shows results, **this might be worth considering**.

Also using AI as an assistant, just need to weed out the AI hallucinations. I'm a 30s man.

**Hopefully for anyone this sounds familiar and can help or we can brainstorm more together. I tried the search but results were quite subjective.**

I have available my 23andme V3 genetic data (300k SNPs raw data I think), which has helped immensely when conversing with AI. I use perplexity, chatgpt, grok, to see different answers.

Trying to be a bit scientific here. Have high resting HR with lamictal. Baseline is 65-70, with **lamictal at 150mg**, it is now around 85-90 (I use a whoop to track, bought it just for this ""journey"").

25,50,75,100,125mg all same issue, high resting HR started the moment i started with 25 (i have everything in my diary so no placebo).

Jealous of people who report sleepyness :D , I have had insomnia for 8 weeks now (only gabapentin helps for that). Have tried taking in the evening, and mornings. Whoop reports mostly of light sleep, barely SWS and REM (so poorly restorative). Total sleep is only 5-6h, with 2-3h restorative. With gabapentin total duration is same but SWS is improved. Doctor gave me propranolol, 10mg helps drop the heart rate but I hate it since i love running and gymming. Been testing morning, evening dosing, to no effect. Sleep is probably worse when taken before bed. Can't use melatonin SR or XR, horrible nightmares everytime with many doses. Only thing what helps is gabapentin.

Genetics-wise: I have high prefrontal cortex dopamine (COMT gene, worrier, not warrior), most likely low mesolimbic dopamine (lifetime anhedonia, only love to read, but dont get a kick of ""normal people fun stuff""), diagnosed cyclothymia, low serotonin clearance (so like built-in SSRI, SSRI make me megazombie and give akathisia). So pretty much makes me a nerdy achiever with superfocus, love to read for hours but otherwise missing any type of enjoyable traits, making me a miserable asshole as well. This is a lifelong thing, I've been like this since opening xmas gifts at 4 years old, my mom reports. Anyways, let's discuss only lamictal, however I think there is a certain genotype which is particularly sensitive.

Hypomania triggers are: coffee, nicotine, poor sleep, work stress, traveling stress, poor eating / low calories

**Anyways: to my theory.**

NE: norepinephrine , DA: dopamine, 5HT: serotonin, HR: Heart Rate (resting)

Is it possible lamictal raises NE -> high HR? And for sensitive people this is the reason for high HR, and insomnia? I'm not trusting the AI answers because the sources are bad so asking here.

1. Gabapentin 600mg drops NE strongly -> reason for way better sleep?
2. I have tested with multiple herbs all kinds of effects and tracked things. Interesting was using Mucuna Pruriens. Taking 100mg l-dopa equivalent (raises DA) in the morning to an empty stomach, HR dropped to normal 65-75 despite taking lamictal at the same time. Effect ended after a few hours and redosing later in the day didn't repeat the effect. To my knowledge, DA and NE are on a seesaw, so raising the other, might lower the other and vice versa.
3. Propranolol helps to drop HR (via NE reduction)
4. EDIT: Eating sugary candy drops my HR and mellows me out, after the initial rush. DA up, NE down? Tested this again with 2 tsp of sugar. HR drop in 10mins 85...90 -> 65...75.

Anyone else done some research on this? Could it just be increased NE? Been total on lamictal for 56 days, so kinda slow taper, 150mg 8 days. Was on 125mg for 11 days but didnt suppress depressive period after hypomania so raised dose. HR still an issue with 125.

Whether you’re looking to revamp your living space or planning to [buy furniture online](https://nakodahomes.com/), staying ahead of the latest trends can help you make stylish and informed choices. From sustainable materials to multifunctional pieces, [furniture stores](https://nakodahomes.com/) are witnessing a shift in demand. This year, the focus is on functionality, comfort, and timeless aesthetics. Let's explore what’s trending in 2025 and what styles are becoming outdated.



What’s In?

1. Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Furniture

Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword; it’s a priority in modern furniture design. Consumers are increasingly opting for eco-friendly options, including reclaimed wood, bamboo, and recycled materials. Online furniture stores are responding by offering stylish yet sustainable collections. The demand for furniture that aligns with environmental consciousness is rising, making it easier than ever to furnish your home without compromising on style. Expect to see an increase in FSC-certified wood, non-toxic finishes, and upcycled materials in furniture stores near you.

2. Multifunctional and Space-Saving Designs

With urban living spaces becoming smaller, multifunctional furniture is gaining popularity. Think sofa sets that convert into beds, dining room tables with built-in storage, and coffee tables that double as workstations. These versatile pieces are ideal for maximizing space in compact apartments. If you’re searching for practical yet stylish furniture, consider browsing an online furniture store that specializes in smart solutions.

3. Bold and Expressive Colors

Neutrals have dominated the furniture scene for years, but 2025 is all about bold colors and vibrant hues. Shades like deep blue, emerald green, and burnt orange are making waves in living rooms, replacing the safe beige and grey palettes. Whether it's a statement sofa set or colorful bedroom furniture, homeowners are embracing rich tones that add personality and warmth to their spaces.

4. Curved and Organic Shapes

Furniture designs in 2025 are moving away from sharp edges and geometric forms. Instead, rounded shapes and organic silhouettes are trending. Sofas, coffee tables, and even bedroom furniture are featuring soft, fluid lines that create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. This trend is inspired by nature and focuses on comfort, making it a perfect choice for modern homes. If you’re planning to buy online furniture, look for pieces with smooth contours and sculptural forms.

5. Mixed Materials and Textures

Combining different materials is a key trend this year. Wood paired with metal, glass with marble, and fabric with leather create a sophisticated and dynamic look. Whether it’s a dining room table with a stone top or a sofa set with metal accents, this fusion of textures adds depth and interest to interiors. Many furniture stores are curating collections that feature diverse materials, giving homeowners plenty of stylish options.

6. Maximalist Decor

Minimalism is taking a backseat as maximalism gains momentum. Bold patterns, layered textures, and statement furniture pieces are defining modern interiors. Think plush velvet sofas, intricate carvings, and eye-catching wallpaper. If you’re browsing a furniture shop near me for the latest trends, expect to find vibrant upholstery, oversized artwork, and elaborate design elements. Maximalism allows for a more personalized and artistic approach to home decor, making it a hit in 2025.

7. Tech-Integrated Furniture

Smart furniture is revolutionizing home living. From coffee tables with built-in wireless charging to bedroom furniture featuring LED lighting and voice control, technology is seamlessly blending into furniture design. Online furniture stores are offering more tech-friendly options, catering to the growing demand for convenience and innovation in home decor. If you love futuristic interiors, investing in smart furniture is a great choice.

8. Vintage and Retro-Inspired Pieces

Vintage aesthetics are making a strong comeback, with furniture stores embracing mid-century modern designs and retro influences. Curved wooden furniture, rattan chairs, and tufted sofa sets are trending, adding a nostalgic charm to contemporary homes. This mix of old and new creates a timeless appeal, perfect for those who appreciate classic craftsmanship. Whether you visit a furniture shop near me or browse online, you’ll notice a revival of vintage-style furniture with a modern twist.

What’s Out?

1. All-White Interiors

For years, all-white interiors have been a go-to choice, but in 2025, they are being replaced by warmer, more inviting hues. Overly sterile and monochrome spaces are giving way to earthy tones, rich colors, and layered textures. Instead of an all-white bedroom furniture set, opt for warm neutrals or deep, rich shades to create a more welcoming ambiance.

2. Fast Furniture

Disposable, low-quality furniture is on its way out as consumers prioritize durability and sustainability. Investing in well-crafted, long-lasting furniture is now a preferred choice over trendy, mass-produced items. If you’re looking to buy furniture online, choose pieces made from solid wood and premium materials that stand the test of time.

3. Overly Matching Furniture Sets

Gone are the days of buying entire furniture sets that look identical. Modern interior design favors a mix-and-match approach, blending different styles, colors, and materials for a curated, eclectic feel. Instead of purchasing a perfectly matching dining room table and chairs, consider mixing different designs to add character to your space. Many furniture stores near me are offering custom pieces that allow for personalization, making homes feel unique and stylish.

4. Open Shelving in Kitchens

While open shelving was once a trendy choice for kitchens, it’s becoming less popular due to its high maintenance. Cluttered shelves and constant dusting have made homeowners rethink this trend. Instead, closed cabinets and hidden storage solutions are making a comeback, keeping kitchens looking neat and organized.

5. Industrial Aesthetic

The raw, exposed brick and metal-heavy industrial style is gradually fading out. Homeowners are leaning towards softer, more comfortable designs that feel cozy rather than cold. If you’re looking for a furniture shop near me that stocks on-trend pieces, go for warm wood tones, soft upholstery, and organic shapes instead of the harsh, industrial look.

6. Excessive Minimalism

While clean lines and clutter-free spaces are still appreciated, ultra-minimalist interiors are losing their appeal. The “less is more” approach is being replaced by layered textures, cozy decor, and furniture with personality. Homeowners are seeking a balance between simplicity and comfort, moving away from overly sparse designs.

Final Thoughts

As we move into 2025, furniture trends are embracing sustainability, bold colors, and multifunctional designs. Whether you’re planning to buy furniture online or visit furniture stores near me, these trends will help you make the best choices for your home decor. From eco-friendly materials to tech-integrated designs, the focus is on comfort, style, and longevity. Stay ahead of the curve by choosing timeless yet trendy furniture pieces that reflect your personality and lifestyle. If you’re looking for the latest sofa set, dining room table, bedroom furniture, or coffee table, be sure to explore a trusted [online furniture store](https://nakodahomes.com/) or a reputable furniture shop near me to find the perfect addition to your home.

I’m looking for some good breakfast spots and maybe some good chill coffee spots.  Any good routes or running trails?  Looking for a good morning run 3-5 miles.  Also going to take a few days after and explore the area and gulf coast all the way to New Orleans, so looking for cool stops, music venues, good restaurants and hidden gems if you’re willing to share a few!  

For my fellow MMJ people, any good smoke 💨 spots, lounges, shops and other places?  

Also…. Fishing spots, nerd stuff, “guy” spots, solo travel advice or… where would you go if you were me? 😂 

I know it’s a lot but I’m also trying to figure out a roadtrip from New Orleans to North Carolina…. It’s usually not enough time to get things done and here I have more time than things to do…. It’s a nice problem! lol",0,1740053654.0,StPetersburgFL,12,0.44,False

She clutched me a bit too tight. So uncertain. Desperately seeking reassurance that all will be well. 

“All will be well,” I tell her. 

“Really?” she asks, slightly pleading, a touch of panic in her voice. 

I can tell her anxiety is through the roof. If I held her hand now, it would be dripping with sweat. And then she’d be mortified. So I hug her again, giving a reassuring squeeze, look into her eyes & say, “Yes, really.”

“But what will happen with…?” 

I just shake my head, smile, & hold up my hand to stop her. 

She doesn’t need all the answers now. She needs to find them out for herself. In her own time, in her own way. To know all the answers now will defeat the purpose of the lesson.

One of the biggest on-going lessons of her life will be to develop a sense of internal safety. To trust that everything will unfold exactly as it should. And to know, in the very depths of her soul, whatever happens, whoever comes, goes, stays or disappoints, whoever breaks her heart, or is there to mend it - she has her own back. So she needs to have these experiences. They’re hard. And they’ll break her. But they’ll break her open. 

I’m so fucking proud of this girl. She keeps giving & getting back up, even when she just wants to curl up into a ball & hide. I want to cry for her, because her heart is as big as the ocean, yet she still struggles to love herself. 

She doesn’t know it yet, but she’s the answer to every prayer she ever asked. 

“I love you so much” I say, holding her face in my hands & kissing her forehead. 

“We’ve got this.”

She nods, wiping away a tear. A tiny part of her believes she’ll be ok. Her faith is small, but it’s there. 

Then we sit down for coffee, in silence & watch the world go by. ",15,1740053544.0,selflove,2,1.0,False
